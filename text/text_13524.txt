BACKGROUND
bacterial viability assays are widely used for example to evaluate antimicrobial properties, to perform microbiological quality monitoring of water, and to determine the viability of unculturable environmental species. they have proven values in areas such as medicine, biotechnology, food industry, as well as environmental monitoring to assess the susceptibility of bacteria against biocides.

the most used techniques to assess bacterial viability are based on indirect measurements of the state of the cells, without any direct indication that bacteria are capable of growth and division. these methods focus on nucleic acid stains, membrane potential, redox indicators, or reporter gene systems . there have been different opinions on the criteria for bacterial viability to define a bacterial cell as dead or alive  <cit> . cellular and membrane integrity is considered to be one criterion distinguishing between viable and dead bacterial cells  <cit> . viable cells are assumed to have intact and tight cell membranes that cannot be penetrated by some staining compounds, whereas dead cells are considered to have disrupted and/or broken membranes. however, situations could occur where cells maintain membrane integrity, but are metabolically inactive  <cit> . in contrary, there are conditions where membrane integrity of viable cells is reduced such as during fast exponential growth in nutrient rich environments  <cit> . thus, external medium or environment and the physiological status of the cells can influence the viability staining  <cit> . these influences can result in an under- or overestimation of the number of viable cells and may lead to incorrect conclusions.

bacterial viability tests are often performed with premixed, ready for use, dual staining kits, such as the baclight™ , composed of two fluorophores syto <dig> and propidium iodide  based on the detection of membrane integrity. advantages of using such a kit are a rapid procedure, quantitative analyses, as well as the possibility to measure using various instruments such as flow cytometer  <cit> , microplate reader  <cit> , and microscope  <cit> . the risk to employ a premixed kit of syto9/pi is, amongst others, the lack of possibility to monitor and subtract all respective background signals.

the red-fluorescent nucleic acid stain pi intercalates to dna with no sequence preference with one dye molecule per four to five base pairs, similar to ethidium bromide  <cit> . when bound to dna fluorescence of pi is enhanced 20- to 30-fold  <cit> . pi is commonly used for identifying dead cells in a population and as counterstain in multicolor fluorescent techniques because it is supposed to penetrate only cells with disrupted membranes and is generally excluded from viable cells. in contrary, the green-fluorescent nucleic acid stain syto <dig> enters live and dead bacterial cells. the fluorescent signal of syto <dig> is strongly enhanced when bound to nucleic acid and shows low intrinsic fluorescence signal when unbound. when both dyes are present, pi exhibits a stronger affinity for nucleic acids than syto <dig>  and hence, syto <dig> is displaced by pi  <cit> . stocks et al. determined the association constants of pi at  <dig>  × 105/m and syto <dig> at  <dig>  × 105/m  <cit> .

the aim of this work was to evaluate to which extent viability assays  can be applied as routine technique and to which extent validation is required, as this method is widely used in various research areas, and applied to various instruments. we identified and studied the critical aspects of the syto9/pi staining using staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa as the model microorganisms and based on the data acquired from microplate reader. the samples were further studied by fluorescence microscopy for quantitative and qualitative analysis.

RESULTS
approach to obtain live and dead bacterial cells
to obtain dead cells isopropanol was first tested. it has been reported that isopropanol increases permeability of the bacterial cell membrane and destroys protein function by denaturing them, thereby kills bacteria  <cit> .

bacterial cells from the same pre-culture were either treated with 70% isopropanol or with  <dig> % nacl solution. isopropanol treated cells led to no colonies in the agar plating experiments, whereas expected number of colonies was obtained from the nacl treated cells . therefore, cells treated with isopropanol were referred as dead cells in this study and nacl solution treated cells as live cells. furthermore, the differently treated cells exhibited similar values  of optical density . this result suggests that the cells, even if dead, kept structural integrity after the treatment with isopropanol. this suggestion was further supported by observation of similar numbers of green-colored cells  and red/yellow-colored cells  with similar shape under the microscope . therefore, the accordingly treated cells were further used as live and dead cells for the staining tests.

syto <dig> staining
mixtures of different ratios of live and dead cells were stained with syto <dig> alone. the fluorescence intensity was measured with the microplate reader. as expected for staining with a membrane permeable dye like syto <dig>  no difference in intensity was observed between live and dead cells of s. aureus . however, for p. aeruginosa with the same total cell numbers 100% dead cells exhibited an 18-fold stronger signal than 100% live cells . this finding is further supported by the intermediate signal intensity of the different mixtures, showing a linear increase with the increase of the fraction of dead cells. the effect of stronger syto <dig> staining of dead cells seems to be common for gram-negative bacteria as we observed the same effect for escherichia coli, but not for the gram-positive bacillus subtilis .figure  <dig>

 and p. aeruginosa
. values were measured after staining with syto <dig> for 15 minutes  and after additional 15 minutes counterstaining with pi . as a control  <dig> % nacl solution  was added  instead of pi to consider dilution and bleaching effects of syto <dig>  cell optical densities  of  <dig>  for s. aureus and  <dig>  for p. aeruginosa were used. error bars represent  <dig> individual repeats with  <dig> replicas for p. aeruginosa and s. aureus, respectively. the error bars for some data points are too small to be seen .



syto <dig> signal after counterstaining with pi
to distinguish live cells from dead ones, pi was added to the mixtures having different live/dead ratios of syto <dig> stained cells. a clear reduction in syto <dig> staining was observed for the dead cells of both strains compared to control samples which were treated with nacl solution . for 100% dead cells of s. aureus and p. aeruginosa the fluorescence intensity of syto <dig> was decreased 87% and 85%, respectively, compared to the control samples based on the measurement with the microplate reader. on the contrary, living cells were significantly less de-stained by the addition of pi, e.g. 5% reduction in syto <dig> signal for 100% s. aureus live cells and 20% for p. aeruginosa. thus, the dead cells of s. aureus exhibited 9-fold weaker syto <dig> signal intensity than the living cells, whereas the dead cells of p. aeruginosa still displayed  <dig> -fold higher syto <dig> intensity than the living ones after counterstaining with pi . these results demonstrate that the displacement of syto <dig> by pi takes place as expected. however, in p. aeruginosa even if the dead cells show strong reduction in syto <dig> fluorescence after pi counterstaining, they possess still stronger syto <dig> fluorescence than the living ones. living cells showed no or only slight reduction in syto <dig> fluorescence after counterstaining, which is expected because pi should not enter intact cells to replace syto <dig> 

during the experiments strong reduction of syto <dig> fluorescence with time was observed, which indicates that syto <dig> is prone for bleaching. therefore, the possibility of syto <dig> bleaching was investigated by measuring green fluorescence of syto <dig> stained cells every 5 minutes. about 4-8% of the syto <dig> signal intensity was lost every 5 minutes, depending on the physiological state of the cell and cell number . different trends can be observed. first, the reduction rate of syto <dig> signal decreases with higher cell numbers. second, the reduction rate is higher for the same amount of dead compared to live cells. interestingly, particular differences in bleaching were observed for live p. aeruginosa cells, which were also shown to be difficult to stain .figure  <dig>

pi signal after counterstaining
upon counterstaining, the pi signal in living s. aureus cells was almost zero after subtraction of background signals , as expected for this membrane-impermeable dye. with increased proportion of dead to live cells the red pi fluorescence increased linearly . however, the absolute fluorescent intensity value was rather low. unbound pi possessed strong background signal with a relative fluorescence intensity unit  of about  <dig>  the dead cells exhibited a rfu of  <dig> after the background subtraction . the background signals of unbound pi could not be prevented in fluorescence readouts. therefore, for reliable interpretation of the pi fluorescence data obtained from the microplate reader background controls and relatively high numbers of dead cells are needed. precise quantitative determination of the amount of dead cells is hence rather difficult.figure  <dig>

microscopical examination of live/dead staining
confocal laser scanning microscope  was used to investigate individual cells stained with either syto <dig> alone or syto9/pi. the results gained from microscopy confirmed the data obtained with the microplate reader. live and dead cells of s. aureus showed similar green fluorescence intensity when stained with syto <dig> alone, while live p. aeruginosa cells are stained clearly less than the dead ones . dead cells of both species, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, exhibited red fluorescence after pi counterstaining . as expected, s. aureus cells that appear red after pi counterstaining show clearly weaker syto <dig> signal . the mean integrated green fluorescence intensity was evaluated with cellprofiler software. it was found that dead s. aureus cells exhibited an almost 5-fold lower signal intensity compared to the living cells . counterstaining of p. aeruginosa resulted in a strong reduction of syto <dig> fluorescence in dead cells. however, dead cells possessed much higher syto <dig> fluorescence than live cells before counterstaining. therefore, the fluorescence reduction in dead cells after counterstaining only resulted in syto <dig> levels similar to that of living cells .figure  <dig>

discussion
the combined usage of syto <dig> and pi in a commercially available kit  was first described in  <dig> and is promoted as a rapid and reliable method for the assessment of bacterial viability that gives quantitative results and can be applied to microplate reader, flow cytometer and microscopes  <cit> . however, the reported data here revealed that there is a clear need for critical evaluation of results obtained from combined staining with syto <dig> and pi. some of these factors have been described previously, mainly based on the results obtained from flow cytometric studies. for example, it has been reported that syto <dig> is not effective in staining some intact gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . the same phenomenon was observed in the current study for the gram-negative bacteria p. aeruginosa  and e. coli . most plausible explanation is that syto <dig> is not readily membrane permeable and has problems to cross the two cell membranes of gram-negative bacteria. another explanation might be that some bacterial cells actively export syto <dig> from their cytoplasm. it was also found that some cells exhibited yellow fluorescence instead of red after syto <dig> and pi staining, which is an often observed phenomenon when baclight™ kit is used  <cit> . the yellow fluorescence was generated when syto <dig> was not completely replaced by pi. considering binding and releasing of syto <dig> and pi to/from nucleic acids are dynamic processes, it is possible that both the green and red dyes were retained within cells at the same time, indicating mostly dead cells  <cit> .

critical factors influencing assessment of syto9/pi staining
binding affinity of syto <dig> to live and dead cells
in the present study, we have observed that live gram-negative bacteria are not always as easily accessible for syto <dig> staining. in our case, this resulted in an 18-fold stronger fluorescence signal for dead p. aeruginosa cells than for live ones. after counterstaining with pi the syto <dig> signal of dead cells was still slightly higher than that of living cells. thus, live cells can be overestimated by combined staining. viable cells might also be detected incorrectly as dead when membranes of viable cells can be perforated during cell division, cell wall synthesis, and injured during stress  <cit> . for example, müsken and co-workers have reported that the isopropanol treated p. aeruginosa cells could not be properly assigned to live or dead cells with the microscope after staining with syto <dig> and pi  <cit> . this result was explained by an incomplete displacement of syto <dig> by pi in dead cells. considering the finding in our study that intact p. aeruginosa cells are less efficiently stained by syto <dig> than dead cells, resulting in similar green fluorescence of both live and dead cells after counterstaining with pi, the results obtained by müsken and co-workers could also be explained by the stronger syto <dig> signal of dead cells than the live ones. since the combined syto9/pi staining was used in that study, it was not possible to assess the higher permeability of syto <dig> to dead cells. thus, the knowledge obtained from single staining will help with interpreting such data: after subtracting the background and cross-signals, the cells appeared red fluorescence could be assigned as dead even if they possessed similar green fluorescence to the live cells.

bleaching of syto9
the fact of fast decrease of syto <dig> signal with time demands to take bleaching into consideration, especially for syto9/pi combined staining. one of the methods to determine the bleaching effect is to use replica in which nacl solution or buffer as a control is added instead of pi. thereby, the reduction in green fluorescence in the control can be subtracted from the samples where pi has been added before calculating the actual displacement of syto <dig> by pi. these values have to be determined empirically as they are highly dependent on the cell numbers, state of the cells and species.

background fluorescence
different background signals have to be taken into consideration when calculating the exact signal intensity to compare results from different conditions. first, the background of unbound dye has to be determined. the background of syto <dig> signal in nacl solution is negligible compared to the strong signal of dna-bound dye, but pi possesses a rather high fluorescence in the unbound form. second, the emission signal intensity of one dye at the wavelength of the other dye should be considered. this background is referred as cross-signal. pi stained cells showed no signal at 528 nm , whereas syto <dig> stained cells displayed rather high signal at 645 nm  which cannot be neglected. for this purpose, the cross-signal of syto <dig> at 645 nm should be subtracted from the total signal obtained at 645 nm. the background signal can be obtained by measuring syto <dig> stained samples having different fluorescent intensities at 528 nm and plotting it against the signal at 645 nm . the syto <dig> stained cells exhibited  <dig> % of the 528 nm signal intensity at 645 nm channel. regarding the overall much higher syto <dig> than pi signal this cross-signal can account for a substantial part of the 645 nm signal . especially, if there are big differences in syto <dig> signal, this can bias the outcome, which is the case for s. aureus  but less pronounced for p. aeruginosa . thus, it is recommended to perform the staining separately in order to minimize the cross-signal background. in practice, syto9/pi staining is often used to determine the killing efficiency of a substance against environmental samples with unknown amount of dead cells. therefore, a standard curve for which the syto <dig>  to pi  fluorescence ratio  is used to calculate the percentage of live/dead cells. since a large proportion of the pi signal can come from the unbound dye, standard curves for evaluation with the microplate reader are only accurate after consideration of background fluorescence. substantial differences are observed when generating standard curve with  and without  background subtraction. due to much higher overall syto <dig> signal than pi signal the green/red ratio is not increasing linearly after subtracting the background . in conclusion, for the 645 nm signal it is highly recommended to subtract background of unbound pi and cross-signal of syto <dig> figure  <dig> 
standard curves for determination of live/dead ratio. standard curves were generated according to the manufacturers’ instructions for the determination of live/dead ratios through dividing fluorescence intensity at 528 nm  by that at 645 nm , referred as g/r ratio. values for different live/dead proportions of s. aureus and p. aeruginosa were plotted either with  or without  background subtraction.



alternatives to syto9
one alternative to syto <dig> for staining bacterial cells is sybr green. it has similar properties regarding fluorescence enhancement upon binding and membrane permeability, and seems to have more homogeneous and reproducible pattern  <cit> . however, similar problems of stronger staining of dead gram-negative bacteria  <cit>  and dependency on the physiological state of cells  <cit>  were reported. other dyes often used to stain dna, such as acridine orange, cannot be used for fast detection of total cell numbers in microplates due to required washing steps. they do not increase fluorescence signal intensity upon binding to dna and unbound dye therefore needs to be washed off. genetic engineering of bacterial strains with green fluorescent protein  instead of fluorescent dye is another useful tool for direct visualization of the cells  <cit> . however, the use of gfp has also several disadvantages. first, it cannot be used for environmental samples as the cells need to contain the gene encoding gfp. second, the production of gfp might alter the cell metabolism and the expression of gfp is dependent on growth conditions and media. furthermore, gfp is not necessarily disappearing from dead cells and thus influences the subsequent outcome by staining with pi.

CONCLUSIONS
there are several critical factors in the use of viability staining of bacteria such as i) bleaching effects of syto <dig>  ii) different binding affinities of syto <dig> to live and dead cells and iii) background fluorescence and cross-signal of one dye into another dye’s channel. nevertheless, using appropriate controls, the combination of syto <dig> and pi can be a very useful tool to detect the live and dead cells in regard to membrane integrity, and for example enables high throughput screening for toxic substances in microtiter plates. for a proper evaluation background controls have to be subtracted, bleaching of syto <dig> has to be considered, and differences in syto <dig> staining for live/dead cells of gram-negative bacteria have to be taken into account.
