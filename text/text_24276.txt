BACKGROUND
porcine circovirus type  <dig>  is a non-enveloped, circular single stranded dna virus belonging to the circoviridiae virus family  <cit> , and is the causative agent of a number of diseases in swine, particularly postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome   <cit> . the genome of pcv <dig> is  <dig> nucleotides long, making it one of the smallest viruses replicating autonomously in mammalian cells  <cit> . pcv <dig> was first isolated from tissues of pmws diseased pigs in canada  <cit> , the us and europe  <cit>  in  <dig>  disease has been reproduced by viral co-infection of colostrum-deprived or gnotobiotic piglets with pcv <dig> and porcine parvovirus   <cit> . particular vaccine adjuvant administration has also been shown to assist development of pmws disease after experimental pcv <dig> infection  <cit> . nevertheless, pcv <dig> is clearly the primary causative agent of pmws  <cit> , requiring the secondary factors such as co-infections or vaccinations for full expression of the disease. it is assumed that secondary viral infections or the administration of immunostimulatory compounds activate pcv <dig> infected cells to divide  <cit> , thus promoting the replicative cycle of pcv <dig>  which is dependent on the host dna polymerase  <cit> .

nevertheless, neither natural nor experimental pcv <dig> infection together with cofactors will induce disease in all infected animals. on the farm, pcv2-induced diseases have been found to increase the pig mortality rate from 2-3% to 14-30%. pmws-diseased animals are most often in the age range of 8- <dig> weeks old. they display clinical symptoms of wasting, diarrhoea, jaundice, respiratory distress and enlarged lymph nodes  <cit> . typical histological findings are also reported in lymph nodes: the follicular architecture is lost, lymphocytes are depleted, histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells infiltrate the lymph nodes, and basophilic inclusion bodies are detected in the histiocytes  <cit> . in addition, interstitial pneumonia, mononuclear inflammatory infiltration in the liver, lymphoplasmacytic colitis and peri-endarteritis are observed  <cit> .

the induction of anti-pcv <dig> neutralizing antibodies  was shown to correlate with protection from disease  <cit> . while important, ab are effective at targeting extracellular virus and cell surface antigen  only. pcv <dig> has been shown to infect epithelial, endothelial and monocytic cells in vivo  <cit> , and in vitro observations on primary cells have confirmed that this reflects replicating virus  <cit> . considering that pcv <dig> is a non-enveloped virus, its capsid protein is unlikely to be expressed at the surface of infected cells; indeed, there is no evidence that this occurs. accordingly, virion proteins could not represent a target for ab-mediated immune defence against pcv2-infected cells; other cytotoxic mechanisms would be required. while natural killer cells and the cytotoxic t lymphocyte -based immune defences are strong candidates for eradicating pcv2-infected cells, there have been no studies characterizing the existence of pcv2-specific t cell responses - neither ctls nor t helper  cell responses. such immune parameters are particularly important for asymptomatic animals, and therefore for our understanding of immune defences in animals resisting disease development.

one study of the immune compartments influenced by pcv <dig> infection demonstrated a lymphopenia involving naïve cd4+cd8- th cells, memory/effector cd4+cd8+ th cells and cd4-cd8+ ctls in diseased, but not healthy animals  <cit> . interleukin  <dig>  and interferon gamma  have also been noted following in vitro pcv <dig> re-stimulation  <cit> , suggesting the existence of both regulatory and stimulatory/effector pathways. in contrast, there has been no study elaborating on the development of t lymphocyte responses in asymptomatic, pcv2-infected animals. therefore, the present study was conducted to analyse and characterise the pcv2-specific t cell responses developing during experimental pcv <dig> and pcv2/ppv dual infection in asymptomatic animals.

RESULTS
clinical monitoring and daily weight gain
following intranasal infection of the 3-week old spf piglets with pcv <dig>  ppv or pcv2/ppv, as described in materials and methods, enlarged inguinal and popliteal lymph nodes were noted in the ppv single and pcv2/ppv dual infected animals from day  <dig> to day  <dig> p.i. this was taken to indicate the presence of the ppv infection. none of the animals in any group displayed fever during the  <dig> days of experiment ; a slight decrease in temperature was noted for the pcv <dig> single, ppv single and pcv2/ppv dual infected animals compared with the pbs group until day  <dig> p.i. . this was considered to be influenced by differences in food management until day  <dig> p.i., because the pbs control animals had remained in the spf breeding unit while the infected animals were in the containment facility. the ad libitum food management can also explain the higher average daily weight gain in the pbs group . overall, the average daily weight gain did not significantly differ among the pcv2/ppv dual, pcv <dig> single and ppv single infected animal groups .

ppv specific antibodies are present from day  <dig> p.i. in the ppv infected animals
the presence of anti-ppv ab was analysed by a commercial competitive ab elisa. at day  <dig> p.i., all pcv2/ppv dual and ppv single infected animals had seroconverted against ppv . the percentage inhibition  values reached 84% and 89% respectively , increasing to 94% and 95% at day  <dig> p.i., and remaining at these levels during the remainder of the observation period of  <dig> days . while the animals of the pbs group were always negative for anti-ppv ab, the animals of the pcv <dig> single infected group seroconverted at day  <dig> p.i. against ppv . this may be explained by the fact that the pcv <dig> single infected animals were handled by the same persons in the same building as the ppv infected animals, even though the animals were in separate rooms with separate ventilation; in contrast, the pbs control group was housed and handled separately in an spf unit. the ppv contamination of the pcv <dig> single infected group happened at around day 10- <dig> p.i. therefore, this group was excluded from all statistical comparisons after day  <dig> p.i.

analysis of anti-pcv <dig> antibodies and pcv <dig> viraemia
when assayed for anti-pcv <dig> specific igg, the pbs control group values were always below background level. the plasma samples from the ppv single infected animals also remained below background levels. seroconversion against pcv <dig> was clearly observed at day  <dig> p.i. in the pcv2/ppv dual infected group, and  <dig> days later in the pcv <dig> single infected group . at day  <dig> p.i., all of the pcv <dig> infected animals had seroconverted against pcv2; the ab titres increased to comparable levels at day  <dig> p.i. in both groups .

the presence of pcv <dig> dna in the piglet plasma was analysed by taqman real time pcr to seek any evidence of pcv <dig> viraemia. samples from the pbs control and the ppv single infected animals all tested negative for the presence of pcv <dig> dna . in contrast, pcv <dig> dna was detected in plasma samples from four of the pcv <dig> single and all five of the pcv2/ppv dual infected animals at day  <dig> p.i. . interestingly, this apparent viraemia was transient; all other time points tested gave negative results .

further analysis of pcv <dig> viraemia was attempted in terms of the presence of viral antigen in pbmc. intracellular staining for the viral capsid  protein by flow cytometry failed to detect antigen, neither in cd172a+ monocytes nor in cd4+ lymphocytes .

pcv2/ppv dual infected animals display a transient decrease in leukocyte and lymphocyte counts
the total leukocytes were counted for individual animals in each group, and the group values compared statistically. a significant decrease in the leukocyte levels was detected in the pcv <dig> single and pcv2/ppv dual infected groups between days  <dig> and  <dig> p.i.  compared with the pbs controls . interestingly, the ppv group showed the highest levels of leukocytes at this time  .

in order to analyse the leukocytes in more detail, and to relate to previous publications, the b- and t-lymphocyte numbers were determined by staining for surface igg and cd3a. consistent with the observed decrease in the leukocyte numbers, the b cell counts in the pcv2/ppv dual infected group declined significantly to all other groups at  <dig> d p.i. . however, this was not observed with the pcv <dig> single infected group. interestingly, a comparable significant rise in b cell levels was noted, in the pcv2/ppv dual and ppv single infected groups, at day  <dig> p.i., compared to the pbs group. . the significantly higher b cell numbers persisted in the ppv single infected group until day  <dig>  compared to the pbs group. the b cell number in the pcv2/ppv dual infected animals was significantly lower than the b cell number in the ppv and pbs group at day  <dig> p.i. .

a significant decrease was also observed for the t lymphocytes at day  <dig> p.i. in the pcv2/ppv dual infected group, but not in the other groups . while an increase was noted in this group at day  <dig> p.i., this was statistically significant from the pbs control group only for the ppv single infected group . again similar to the b cell counts, the t cell numbers significantly decreased at day  <dig> p.i. in the pcv2/ppv dual infected animals compared to the ppv single infected group or pbs group .

overall, the data shows a decrease in leukocyte and lymphocyte numbers in the pcv2/ppv dual infected animals, even though the animals remained clinically asymptomatic. although there was a "recovery" of the leukocyte numbers thereafter, this did not continue to increase with the pcv2/ppv dual infected animals in the same fashion as in the pbs control group and ppv infected group. this was particularly the case for the t lymphocytes.

pbmc of pcv <dig> infected animals respond to pcv <dig> re-stimulation by ifn-γ secretion
ifn-γ elispot assay for ex-vivo pcv <dig> re-stimulation of pbmc was employed to quantify the pcv <dig> specific ifn-γsc arising following infection. firstly, pbmc were freshly isolated from two pcv <dig> immune adult pigs, to determine the levels and range of ifn-γsc which could be expected. the cells were re-stimulated with increasing amounts of pcv <dig> or mock for  <dig> h. a clear pcv2-specific response was observed in terms of the numbers of ifn-γsc/ <dig> cells; this increased in a dose-dependent manner when the re-stimulation employed pcv <dig> .

the above permitted an analysis of the time-dependent appearance of pcv2-specific ifn-γsc following pcv <dig> infection, using freshly isolated pbmc from the pbs control, pcv <dig> single, ppv single or pcv2/ppv dual infected piglets. the number of ifn-γ sc/ <dig> cells at day  <dig> remained at background levels for all groups . in three of the five pcv2/ppv dual infected animals, pcv <dig> specific ifn-γ sc were detected at day  <dig> p.i. . this was clearly pcv <dig> specific, because re-stimulation with mock did not lead to ifn-γ secretion. in contrast, the number of ifn-γ sc in the pcv <dig> single infected animals was similar to the background levels obtained with mock antigen stimulation. by day  <dig> p.i., pbmc from both pcv2/ppv dual and pcv <dig> single infected groups gave a pcv2-specific ifn-γ sc response upon in vitro re-stimulation . in both groups, four out of five animals responded to the virus re-stimulation, giving ifn-γ sc numbers similar to or slightly higher than the numbers obtained for the pbmc from the pcv2/ppv dual infected group at day  <dig> p.i.

an interesting result was observed with the pbmc from the ppv single-infected group. at day  <dig> p.i., the level of ifn-γ sc raised in the ppv single infected group regardless if cells were restimulated with pcv <dig> or mock antigens . although this observed response was the highest for all the groups, it was not pcv2-specific. moreover, the level of activation did not relate to that obtained with cells from the pcv2/ppv dual infected group  and the response against the mock antigen was not observed when the animal donors of the pbmc had been dually infected with pcv <dig> and ppv . these results suggested that an unspecific ifn-γ response is elicited in pbmc from the ppv single infected animals and is absent in the pcv2/ppv animals, which only display an anti-pcv <dig> specific response.

by day  <dig> p.i., pbmc from the ppv single-infected group were still capable of responding similarly to both pcv <dig> and mock antigens, but now the response was lower than that observed at day  <dig> p.i. . moreover, the ifn-γ sc response was lower than the pcv2-specific response obtained with pbmc from the pcv <dig> infected groups  stimulated with pcv <dig> .

overall, it can be seen that the pcv2/ppv dual and the pcv <dig> single infected groups did generate pcv2-specific lymphocytes, in terms of ifn-γ sc. these were clearly identifiable at  <dig> and  <dig> days p.i., respectively. there was variation in the number of ifn-γ sc/ <dig> cells, both between the groups and between animals, ranging from 4- <dig> ifn-γ sc/ <dig> cells between individual piglets responding in a positive and pcv2-specific manner.

contribution of cd4+ and cd8+ cells in the pcv2-specific recall response
in order to characterize the nature of the ifn-γ sc detected by the above ex vivo analyses, the recall response of frozen pbmc samples from the pcv2-immune piglets was analysed in the presence of anti-cd <dig> and anti-cd <dig> ab  <cit> . the thawed pbmc were expanded for  <dig> days in the presence of the virus plus  <dig> u/ml of rpoil- <dig>  to expand antigen-specific t-cells expressing higher levels of cd <dig>  than unspecific naive cells  <cit> . an initial experiment was performed to ascertain if pbmc which had been frozen would retain their capacity to respond against the pcv <dig> antigen. fig.  <dig> shows that the frozen pbmc efficiently responded to the pcv <dig> re-stimulation in terms of ifn-γ sc, albeit with a lower frequency of ifn-γ sc compared with freshly isolated cells. moreover, the detection sensitivity for the ifn-γ sc assay was increased when the re-stimulated pbmc were cultured for  <dig> days.

when the in vitro pcv <dig> re-stimulation assays were repeated in the presence of anti-cd <dig> or anti-cd <dig> ab, both treatments impaired the development of the ifn-γ sc . in contrast, anti-cd <dig> ab did not decrease the number of ifn-γ sc induced by the pcv <dig> re-stimulation .

considering the results obtained with anti-cd <dig> and anti-cd <dig> ab in the elispot assay, the pbmc from pcv2-immune animals, isolated  <dig> months after infection, were analysed further with respect to their phenotype by flow cytometry. following in vitro re-stimulation, the ifn-γ sc were defined in terms of cd <dig> expression, and the presence of intracellular ifn-γ . mhc class i restricted ctls were defined by gating on the cd8hi population and the remaining lymphocytes by gating on the cd8-/low cells. the later were composed of th, nk cells, γ/δ t cells and b cells. both cd8hi ctls and cd8-/low cells were found to express the ifn-γ in response to pcv <dig> antigen . the ifn-γ expressing cells were clearly found to be reactive lymphocytes, represented by an increase in ifn-γ positive cells if the gate of interest was placed on blasting cells . the observation that cells isolated from naïve pigs showed no ifn-γ response following restimulation with pcv <dig>  would imply that the observed ifn-γ production within the cd8-/low cell population represented a th cell-derived memory response. together with the observed impairment of the pcv2-specific ifn-γ response by both anti-cd <dig> and anti-cd <dig> ab  we conclude that pcv2-specific t lymphocytes reside within both ctl and th populations, at least with respect to the ifn-γ response.

discussion
although pcv <dig> will cause the development of diseases such as pmws, not all pcv2-infected animals develop disease symptoms  <cit> ; in fact the majority may remain asymptomatic. moreover, a number of models, including the pcv2/ppv co-infection model in spf piglets used for the present work, generate more often asymptomatic infections  <cit> . in view of the reports showing that pcv <dig> infection leads to modulation of t lymphocyte activity  <cit> , the present work sought to characterize the t lymphocyte response in animals following infection with pcv <dig>  this is particularly pertinent considering the reports on t lymphocytes in sow colostrum  <cit> , and the reported transfer of antigen-specific t-cell immunity to piglets, either by transplacental passage or via the colostrum  <cit> . the study was designed to relate observations on the t lymphocyte subsets to the development of specific anti-pcv <dig> humoral immunity, since the presence of pcv <dig> specific neutralizing antibodies argues for the existence of pcv <dig> specific th cells  <cit> .

accordingly, samples were employed from an experimental infection by pcv <dig> alone or in combination with ppv, in which the virus-inoculated animals remained asymptomatic. the asymptomatic outcome of pcv2/ppv dual infection in colostrum-fed piglets was also reported by other groups  <cit> . the exact reason that certain animals remain subclinically infected is not known but reflects the field scenario. the genetic background of the animals, environmental factors like stress and management factors like food change and bad hygiene have a certain impact on disease development  <cit> . recently, certain pcv <dig> viral strains were correlated to different disease outcome  <cit> . therefore, multiple reasons may have caused the failure of disease reproduction in this study. in general, the absence of clinical disease correlates with the presence of a pcv <dig> specific b and t cell response in the infected animals.

the experimental data from the present work is in agreement with published data on humoral immune defence development  <cit> , in that the development of subclinical pcv <dig> infection was confirmed by the presence of pcv2-specific antibodies and pcv <dig> dna in the blood. interestingly, the pcv <dig> viraemia in this study was transient reflecting the ongoing pcv <dig> specific t and b cell immune response in the infected animals and clearance of the circulating virus. the pre-existence of pcv <dig> maternal antibodies can be ruled out, as the piglets tested at the age of  <dig> weeks and the mother sows displayed no pcv <dig> specific antibodies.

no differences in the levels of the pcv <dig> ab titres were observed in the pcv2/ppv dual infected animals compared to the pcv <dig> single infected animals. when compared with the kinetics of the anti-ppv response, the development of the anti-pcv <dig> ab appeared to be delayed, an observation also made by others  <cit> . this may reflect differences in the immunogenicity of the two viruses  <cit> , but may also relate to the rate at which pcv <dig> replicates  <cit> . the response in the pcv2/ppv dual infected animals did precede that in the pcv <dig> single infected animals by  <dig> days. although one could argue that the concomitant ppv infection may have activated the immune system to respond more rapidly against pcv <dig>  further experimentation would be required to ascertain if such a short time delay has any significance. on the other hand, one has to consider the ppv infection that occurred accidentally at around day 10- <dig> p.i. in the pcv <dig> single infected animals and might have influenced the pcv <dig> specific ab response of this group at later time points. not to cause misinterpretation of the data, the pcv <dig> single infected group was only included in the statistical comparisons until day  <dig> p.i.

considering the pcv <dig> infection, no apparent influence on the humoral response against ppv was observed: the titres and kinetics of the anti-ppv ab response did not differ between the ppv single and pcv2/ppv dual infected groups.

a full appreciation of adaptive immune defences developing after pcv <dig> infection requires analysis of t lymphocyte activity, particularly when considering the influence of pcv <dig> on t lymphocyte numbers and activities  <cit> . the present work identified an influence on lymphocytes in asymptomatic animals, seen as a decrease in cd3+ t cells and igg+ b cells in pcv2/ppv dual infected animals . being a transient decrease, followed by a significant rise in b and t cell numbers, the animals may recover from an immunosuppressed state caused by the concomitant pcv2/ppv infection. this recovery would explain the asymptomatic outcome.

using elispot with pbmc from pcv2-infected animals, we were able to estimate the development of the frequency of pcv2-specific t-cells. these were detected at an earlier time point  in the pcv2/ppv dual infected animals than in the pcv <dig> single infected animals. all pcv2-infected animals responded to pcv <dig> recall antigen stimulation with ifn-γ secretion by  <dig> days post-infection. this kinetics is slower in comparison to that reported for experimental infection of gnotobiotic pigs with human norovirus  <cit>  - peaking at day  <dig> p.i., followed by a relative stability. porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus  also induces ifn-γ sc with a similar kinetics  <cit> , the prrsv-induced activity peaking at day  <dig> p.i., after which the numbers were relatively stable for the remainder of the experiment. our data suggest that pcv <dig> is not a strong a t cell immunogen probably due to a slow replication of pcv2; the pcv2-specific humoral response is also slow to develop. either of these scenarios would be in agreement with our previous demonstration that pcv <dig> alone does not activate professional antigen presenting cells or lymphocytes in vitro  <cit> , and is seen to replicate slowly in primary cell cultures  <cit> .

early after infection, an unspecific ifn-γ response was observed in the ppv single infected animals: similar levels of ifn-γ sc were induced by in vitro re-stimulation with the negative mock control antigen and pcv <dig> antigen. this response appears to be antigen-unspecific, possibly reflecting nk cells or γ/δ t cell activities. interestingly, it was absent in the pcv2/ppv dual infected animals, indicating a possible immunomodulatory effect associated with the pcv <dig> infection. this relates to a recent publication showing that in vitro pcv2-infected pbmc displayed an impaired ifn-γ response upon recall stimulation with pseudorabies virus  <cit> . the reported effect was apparently mediated by il- <dig>  which can influence antigen-specific and antigen non-specific responses, as mediated by nk cells and γ/δ t cells.

the anti-pcv <dig> t lymphocyte response was further characterized using blocking antibodies which would interfere with functional cd <dig> and cd <dig> molecules. analyses showed that the response involved both cd4+ helper and cd8+ cytotoxic t cells in the ifn-γ response. this was supported by an increase in ifn-γ secreting cd8hi and cd8-/low cells when pbmc from pcv <dig> infected animals were re-stimulated with pcv <dig> in vitro. future studies are required to determine how such responses develop in animals with pcv <dig> associated diseases and after vaccination, and how they contribute to protective immunity.

CONCLUSIONS
asymptomatic pcv2-infected animals develop antigen-specific humoral and t cell responses, albeit with a relatively slow kinetics. the latter involves both ctl and helper t lymphocyte populations, confirmed as pcv2-specific through comparative stimulations with pcv <dig> and mock antigens.
