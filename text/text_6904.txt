BACKGROUND
tea is produced from the plant camellia sinensis  o. kuntze in the family theaceae. tea is one of the most popular beverages worldwide, and tea leaves represent an important source of many biologically active metabolites such as flavonoids, theanine and caffeine  <cit> . flavonoids mainly comprise flavan-3-ols , epicatechin , gallocatechin , epigallocatechin , catechin  and their respective gallate esters, such as epigallocatechin gallate  and epicatechin gallate   <cit> . tea leaves, which contain various secondary metabolites, are usually used as the raw material for tea production. however, the molecular mechanisms that regulate the biosynthesis of catechins, theanine and caffeine in tea remain elusive.

great effort has focused on elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying plant growth, development  <cit>  and secondary metabolite production  <cit>  in tea. most of these studies have focused on characterizing genes related to secondary metabolism, most of which were revealed through est sequencing  <cit>  and analysis of the transcriptomes from various tissues of tea plants  <cit>  or under different stress conditions  <cit> . more recently, shi et al. discovered novel candidate genes involved in pathways in tea by analyzing transcriptome data  <cit> . liu et al. reported the discovery of a novel enzyme involved in galloylated catechin biosynthesis in tea plants  <cit> . however, the lack of genomic information has become an obstacle to exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying secondary metabolite biosynthesis in tea. transcriptome sequencing represents an efficient approach to obtaining functional genomic information.

rna-seq is a rapid technique for genome-wide gene expression analysis that is widely used to determine gene structures and expression profiles in model organisms. de novo assembly of rna-seq data makes it possible to conduct gene analysis in the absence of reference genomes . comparative transcriptomic studies have been performed to identify differential gene expression in several organisms .

another widely known member of theaceae is oil tea, camellia oleifera abel, a tree serving as an important source of edible oil that is grown specifically in china. oil tea was genetically closely to tea, and they both belonged to genus camellia. here, we performed rna-seq on buds and second leaves of tea and oil tea to characterize differences in gene expression between these two plants. this comparative transcriptomic analysis provides important insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying secondary metabolite biosynthesis in tea, as well as the phytochemical characteristics of its main metabolites.

RESULTS
analysis of the contents of catechins, theanine and caffeine
hplc analyses were conducted to determine the contents of catechins, theanine and caffeine, and related intermediates in buds and five leaves of tea and oil tea . all standard compounds showed good linearity  in a relatively wide concentration range. compared to oil tea, most of these metabolites were present at higher concentrations in tea . the average contents of three characteristic components  in tea leaves were  <dig> - to 173-fold higher than those in oil tea leaves. in particular, tea contained over a 180 mg/g of total catechins in its leaves and buds. the only exception is that the anthocyanin content in oil tea leaves was 32-fold higher than that in tea leaves. these results confirm that tea is rich in catechins, theanine and caffeine .fig.  <dig> determined contents of compounds involved in three main secondary metabolic pathways. a samples examined. buds and five initial leaves were collected from tea and oil tea. bud, l <dig>  l <dig>  l <dig>  l <dig> and l <dig> indicate the bud, first, second, third, fourth and fifth leaf, respectively. b variation in the contents of compounds biosynthesized by catechin-, theanine- and caffeine-related metabolic pathways


a average contents in leaves were calculated using values from the five initial leaves



moreover, the contents of these characteristic constituents varied during the period from the appearance of buds to the appearance of the five leaves. the levels of gc, egc and ec increased from the bud to the second or third leaves in tea, whereas a general decline in caffeine, total catechins, ecg and egcg levels was observed in tea leaves.

a steady decrease in theanine levels was observed from the first leaf to the fifth leaf in tea, and the levels of this compound were almost seven-fold greater in buds than in leaves. a similar variation was detected in oil tea, but the absolute contents were much lower. due to the variation in the contents of most compounds  in the three initial leaves, we selected the second leaves and buds of tea and oil tea for rna-seq.

de novo assembly and comparative analyses of rna-seq data
we utilized illumina rna-seq technology to sequence the buds and second leaves of tea and oil tea. after removing adaptor sequences, duplication sequences, ambiguous reads and low-quality reads, a total of  <dig>  gb of clean reads was generated, with an average of  <dig>  gb clean reads per sample .table  <dig> statistics from the generated rna-seq reads



the final assembly of tea had  <dig>  unigenes with an n <dig> length of  <dig>  bp . functional annotation revealed  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes with alignments to the nr , nt , swiss-prot , kegg , cog  and go  databases, respectively. the final assembly of oil tea consisted of  <dig>  unigenes with an n <dig> length of  <dig>  bp. of these,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes were annotated by alignment against the nr, nt, swiss-prot, kegg, cog and go databases, respectively . sequence comparisons revealed that  <dig>  genes are shared by both tea and oil tea,  <dig>  of which were mapped to kegg pathways   <cit> . high amino acid sequence identity was found in the homologous genes between tea and oil tea, as 64 % of the genes shared over 70 % identity. we also detected  <dig>  specific transcripts in tea and  <dig>  in oil tea.table  <dig> summary of assemblies of rna-seq data



analysis of the differentially expressed genes 
the degs were identified by comparing fpkm  values  <cit>  between different libraries under the thresholds of log <dig>  over  <dig> and fdr less than  <dig>  . the results indicated that both tea and oil tea had more genes with higher transcription levels in the second leaves than in buds. compared with oil tea, tea contained more degs  with increased expression in both buds and leaves than oil tea . next, we analyzed the degs using kegg pathway analysis, which assigned  <dig>  degs derived from tea buds versus oil tea buds ,  <dig>  from tea buds versus tea leaves ,  <dig>  from tea leaves versus oil tea leaves  and  <dig>  from oil tea buds versus leaves . high proportions of these degs are involved in secondary metabolite pathways, including  <dig> degs  from tbvsotb,  <dig>  from tl2vsotl <dig>   <dig>  from tbvstl and  <dig>  from otbvsotl, respectively. the estimated rich factors  of secondary metabolism were  <dig> – <dig>  in tbvsotb and tlvsotl , whereas they were  <dig> – <dig>  in tbvstl and otbvsotl . the degs identified through comparisons between tea and oil tea were clustered in the pathway secondary metabolism, suggesting that there are different secondary metabolism pathways in these two species. a lower rich factor between two stages for either of two species implies that steady metabolism occurs during this period .fig.  <dig> number of identified degs identified by comparing gene expression levels between any two tissues. the numbers of significantly up-regulated genes  > 1; fdr <  <dig> ) between two tissues . arrows indicate up-regulated genes associated with each number

identification of dges involving in characteristic metabolic pathways in tea
we used qrt-pcr to confirm the differential expression levels of  <dig> degs involved in the biosynthesis of catechins, theanine and caffeine and quantified their maximum transcription levels in tea and oil tea . of these genes, the data from  <dig>  matched the rna-seq data. as determined from the published flavonoid pathways  <cit> , catechin biosynthesis occurs via successive enzymatic reactions . interestingly, pal  and chi  genes, which are employed in the upstream phenylpropanoid pathway, were more highly expressed in oil tea than in tea. however, in the downstream biosynthetic pathway of catechins, the f3h , dfr  and anr  genes were more highly expressed in tea. notably, the anr gene encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of anthocyanidins to  <dig> -cis-flavan-3-ol, which is an intermediate in the final step of esterified catechin synthesis. both rna-seq and qrt-pcr analyses revealed considerable activation of the anr gene in tea but not in oil tea, which is consistent with the data from hplc analyses of ec, egc, c and gc contents. the dfr, lar and anr genes in tea are responsible for the biosynthesis of nongalloylated catechins  <cit> . the differential expression levels of f3h, dfr and anr genes might be responsible for the differences detected in the levels catechin components between tea and oil tea.fig.  <dig> pathways of the three main secondary metabolites in tea and oil tea. a core reactions of flavonoid biosynthesis involved in the biosynthesis of catechins. compound names are shown below each arrow. abbreviations beside the arrows indicate the enzymes catalyzing the transfer. the gene expression levels detected by qrt-pcr are shown in the histograms within the corresponding circles. transcription level is indicated as the mean  ± sd. b core reactions of the theanine biosynthesis pathway.  core reactions of the caffeine biosynthesis pathway



tea buds and leaves contain theanine at levels as much as 252-fold and 86-fold those of oil tea , respectively. however, we did not identify genes encoding the enzyme responsible for the final reaction in theanine biosynthesis. the qrt-pcr analysis revealed that the gs  and gdh  genes were more highly expressed in tea than in oil tea . previous studies suggest that theanine is synthesized from glutamic acid and ethylamine by ts , which is highly homologous to glutamine gs  <cit> . phytochemical analysis revealed a much higher content of theanine in tea buds and leaves than in oil tea, suggesting a potential connection between the activation of gs genes and high theanine levels in tea. in our transcriptomic data, five gs unigenes were found in tea and seven in oil tea. whether they are functional copies of ts genes remains to be confirmed by further analysis of enzymatic reactions.

there are three key enzymes in the caffeine biosynthesis pathway: tcs , impdh  and sams   <cit> . we detected homologous genes that are involved in four steps of the caffeine pathway. tcs catalyzes the final step in caffeine biosynthesis. the tcs gene was much more highly expressed in tea buds and leaves  than in oil tea, although the genes responsible for the upstream reactions had higher transcription levels in oil tea, which was confirmed by qrt-pcr .

taken together, our investigation of gene expression in tea revealed the activation of related metabolic pathways compared to oil tea. most genes exhibited slightly higher expression levels in buds than in leaves . these findings are potentially related to the differences in metabolic components revealed by hplc.

discussion
in this study, we observed differences in the contents and gene expression patterns of the characteristic compounds in tea compared to oil tea. we found that tea contains more beneficial nutrients, such as catechins, theanine and caffeine, in its buds and leaves because the pathways related to these metabolites were considerably more active in tea than in oil tea. theanine is a unique non-protein amino acid that was first discovered in tea. there are trace amounts of this compound in two other camellia species  and in one species of mushroom   <cit> .

of the phenolic compounds, high flavonoid levels are present in oil tea, as revealed by hplc   <cit> . flavonoids are a class of important secondary metabolites including flavanones, flavones, dihydroflavonols, flavonols and flavan-3-ols . these compounds are important for tea quality and are beneficial for human health   <cit> . catechins, theanine and caffeine are the main characteristic compounds in tea, and the results of our analysis of these compounds are in accordance with recent reports  <cit> . oil tea is genetically closely to tea, but no theanine and caffeine were reported except flavonoids in oil tea leaves in previous study  <cit> . we chose tea and oil tea buds and leaves of plants from the same environment for analysis to reveal the mechanism behind the high levels catechins, theanine and caffeine in tea. our results indicated that the catechins, theanine and caffeine in tea were also present in oil tea, but in much lower amounts. we detected increased expression of some key genes in these three metabolic pathways in tea compared to oil tea, which might lead to the differences in their contents.

our results indicated that the genes encoding f3h, dfr and anr in the flavonoid pathway were more highly expressed in tea than in oil tea. on the contrary, the expression levels of pal and chi genes were lower in tea than in oil tea. these observations were consistent with previous results  <cit> . high pal activity was associated with the accumulation of flavonoids and other phenolic compounds  <cit> , and dfr, anr and lar played an important role in the formation of catechins  <cit> . xiong et al. found that stable expression of f3h insured the formation of dihydrokaempferol, the precursor of individual catechins  <cit> . in the current study, we did not observe a difference in the expression levels of the c4h gene between tea and oil tea.

our analysis of the degs related to flavonoid, theanine and caffeine metabolism in tea and oil tea suggests that these two species share common pathways, but the expression levels of some key genes in these pathyways might result in differential biosynthesis of catechins, theanine and caffeine.

since tea is self-incompatible and recalcitrant to genetic manipulation, little genetic or genomic information is currently available for this species. therefore, instead of providing a comprehensive in-depth investigation of the tea transcriptome, our experiment was designed to generate a quick view of the landscape. moreover, since there were significant differences in the contents of the major components from one bud and five leaves of tea versus oil tea, we used the transcriptome data to search for key genes in these metabolic pathways and to uncover the factors underlying this divergence. the quality of tea in large part depends on its metabolic profiles. we therefore performed additional analyses of catechin, theanine and caffeine biosynthesis. we were able to detect almost all genes in these metabolic pathways. many of these genes appeared to form multigene families, implying that the tea genome, like the genomes of many other higher plants, had undergone one or more rounds of genome duplication during evolution  <cit> , which might explain why higher levels of gene expression did not always lead to higher enzyme activity in the present study. in our annotated tea and oil tea transcriptome dataset, multiple transcripts encoding all degs involved in flavonoid, theanine and caffeine biosynthesis pathways were identified.

using a reciprocal best hit  method with relatively strict filters,  <dig>  putative ortholog pairs were identified between tea and oil tea. we calculated their ka  /ks  ratios to estimate the rate of gene evolution  <cit> . of these ortholog pairs,  <dig>   had a ka/ks value of  <dig> or less than  <dig>  while  <dig>  had a ka/ks value of over  <dig> , suggesting that they were under positive selection . functional go analysis revealed that most genes under ps were grouped into go terms cell, cell part, binding and metabolic process . of the  <dig> ps genes,  <dig> exhibited differential expression among tissues . notably, some ps orthologs encode chi and dfr in the flavonoid pathway. chi is a rate-limiting enzyme, and dfr is key enzyme, in the catechin-producing branch of the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway  <cit> . since the ka/ks ratio is widely used to detect selective pressure acting on protein-coding sequences  <cit> , rapid evolution of the chi and dfr genes might be associated with adaptive selection in plants. no ps ortholog was assigned to the theanine or caffeine pathway. environmental factors might play an important role in the evolution of the flavonoid pathway. indeed, the highest quality green tea from japan  was grown in the shade and contains high levels of amino acids but low levels of catechins  <cit> .fig.  <dig> go classification of orthologs between tea and oil tea under positive selection . go analysis of orthologous genes between tea and oil tea under positive selection based on biological process, cellular component and molecular function categories. the y-axis indicates the number of genes assigned to the same go terms



CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we examined the levels of characteristic metabolites in tea compared to oil tea, revealing  trace amounts of theanine in oil tea. the contents of major metabolites were higher in tea than in oil tea. the genes involved in most of these pathways were more highly expressed in tea than in oil tea, especially key enzymes that function at branch points in these pathways, which might explain the differential biosynthesis of metabolites  in tea versus oil tea. comparative transcriptome analyses demonstrated the connection between gene expression and the biosynthesis of catechins, theanine and caffeine. comparative transcriptome analyses comparing the levels of metabolites between tea and oil tea not only enabled us to provide a preliminary description of the gene expression profiles, but it also helped elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the biosynthesis of characteristic biochemicals in tea. the transcriptome data obtained in this study will serve as an invaluable platform for further studies of the molecular biology and genomes of tea and oil tea.
