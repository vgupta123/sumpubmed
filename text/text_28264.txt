BACKGROUND
human febrile respiratory illness  results in significant annual health and economic burden worldwide, but the diversity and number of pathogens make differential diagnosis very challenging. thus, it represents a useful example where many organisms ranging from bacteria  to fairly conserved viruses  to genetically diverse viruses, i.e. influenza a virus, human rhinoviruses , and human enteroviruses  need to be detected for successful differential diagnosis. several technologies, masscode™ multiplex rt-pcr system  <cit> , electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis of pcr amplicons  <cit> , luminex® xmap™  <cit> , and various microarray-based approaches  <cit> , are currently under development as diagnostic platforms to effectively and simultaneously detect and identify large numbers of diverse viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens. one high-density resequencing microarray platform, the respiratory pathogen microarray version  <dig> , has been successfully demonstrated to identify a much broader range of pathogens  in a single test at sensitivities and specificities that are similar to or improved over those of other technologies  <cit> . in addition, the rpm v. <dig> platform has the demonstrated capability to discriminate among known and previously unknown strains and variants of targeted pathogens  <cit> .

while promising, the rpm v. <dig> platform was a proof-of-concept microarray for the detection of  <dig> common respiratory pathogens primarily encountered among military basic trainees. it did not provide comprehensive coverage of all potential respiratory pathogens and the design methodology used was not appropriate for genetically diverse viruses. the design methodology for the rpm v. <dig> microarray consisted of applying selection rules developed for long oligonucleotide microarrays. these rules were not optimal but worked for bacterial organisms and fairly conserved viruses since previous studies had shown a single sequence on a resequencing microarray could reliably detect and serotype strains with as much as  <dig> to 15% variation  <cit> . their application to cover more diverse viral organisms was less successful. for example, the 5' untranslated region  sequence chosen for hrv on the rpm v. <dig> only provided identification of the prototype hrv- <dig> and very little coverage of other hrv serotypes. the 5'utr sequences, which are relatively conserved among hrv and hev, have been used in pcr and de novo sequencing for tentative viral identification or serotype classification in lieu of the much more variable capsid proteins that actually determine serotypes  <cit> . however, the 5'utr sequences still have ~ <dig> to 30% nucleotide sequence variations among different serotypes so require more than one prototype sequence for proper identification and serotyping. serotyping hrv and hev is important to fri differential diagnosis because even though these "common cold" viruses generally only induce mild symptoms, they can cause a wide variety of other severe illnesses, such as aseptic meningitis  <cit> , bronchitis and asthma  <cit> .

new resequencing pathogen microarray designs, versions  <dig>  and  <dig>  , have been constructed to address the shortcomings of the previous design. the use of  <dig> μm feature allows microarrays with greater coverage, currently  <dig>  of common respiratory organisms and high human health risk zoonotic pathogens . a new approach to select a minimal number of prototype sequences that can be used to detect all and correctly identify many of the relevant strains of genetically diverse viruses such as hrv and hev was developed. due to the great genetic diversity of hrv and hev, in order to ensure that designed probes  generated from selected database sequences  would detect and discriminate all serotypes of hrv and hev, a predictive model was used to assist the microarray design  <cit> . this in silico model developed for predicting resequencing microarray hybridization patterns shows good concordance in the overall percentage of base calls predicted versus experimental results. thus it is possible to use this model for evaluating the performance of database sequences as potential prototype regions. in this study, we report on results of this algorithm applied to the 5'utr sequences of hrv and hev and confirm that using ~15% of the rpm-flu v.30/ <dig> microarray  is sufficient to detect and differentiate many hrv and hev serotypes.

RESULTS
microarray design process
in silico modeling
probe sequence selection
the simulated result of a target sequence for the current prototype sequence was then run through the previously developed cibsi analysis algorithm  <cit>  with the following criteria. a sequence was considered detected by the current prototype sequence if at least one region of  <dig> or more contiguous nucleotides was predicted to consist of a, c, g, and t base calls and no ambiguous base calls . as shown in figure  <dig> "yes" for "cibsi would identify" updated the list of sequences that could be detected by the current prototype sequence. this procedure was applied for every downloaded sequence. for example, if we collect sequences "a-z" from genbank, we will first use sequence "a" as a prototype sequence, then use sequences "b-z" each in turn to generate target sequences for in silico simulation. after the completion of the simulation and cibsi analysis, a list of sequences from the pool of sequences "b-z" that can be detected by prototype sequence "a" will be generated. then the cycle begins again with sequence 'b" as prototype sequence, while sequences "a, c-z" each in turn is used as target sequences to generate the list for sequence "b". the cycle will continue until we generate the list for all download sequences . after this is completed, the second stage of the process will be undertaken. the number of sequences that a sequence  is predicted to detect will be sorted and ordered. the sequence that was predicted to detect the most other sequences  was selected as a probe sequence to be used in the microarray design. it was then removed from the list of sequences. all the target sequences detected by that prototype sequence were also removed from the list of sequences. this procedure was repeated until the list of sequences was empty. when two or more prototype sequences were predicted to detect the same maximal number of target sequences, one was randomly selected hence the method was non-deterministic. the process was repeated with different random seeds and the number of required probe sequences did not vary significantly while the sequences used in the microarray design could change.

application: hrv and hev
the described design method could be applied to any group of sequences and a minimum set of prototype regions would be determined. the group of sequences used for hrv probe design was chosen using different criteria than those used to select the hev sequences in the hev probe design due to differences in the available sequences for each in genbank. at the time of this design, only eight hrv serotypes had complete genomes sequenced. these genome sequences and all complete and partial 5'utr sequences available for hrv in genbank were retrieved in april  <dig> and a total of  <dig> sequences were used in the predictive modeling. a set of  <dig> sequences with lengths between  <dig> and  <dig> bp were predicted to provide detection of all those input sequences .

because hev is better characterized with complete genome sequences of all  <dig> recognized serotypes, the design algorithm was applied to one complete genome sequence of each serotype. in addition, the design algorithm was applied to the 3d region. the design procedure generated  <dig> to  <dig> sequences for hev detection using 5'utr region, and  <dig> sequences were predicted to detect all hev 3d regions. it was decided to use corresponding 5'utr sequences of the  <dig> genomes that the 3d targets were selected from so that the same serotype was targeted by both target regions . these  <dig> 5'utr regions were predicted to still provide complete and now redundant coverage.

specificity of rpm-flu v.30/ <dig> chip for hrv detection and serotyping: design method 1
to assess the performance of rpm-flu v.30/ <dig> chip design,  <dig> known hrv serotype strains obtained from atcc were tested. of the  <dig> strains,  <dig> had corresponding 5'utr sequences tiled on the microarray and were called prototype serotypes, which were used to verify the accuracy of the designed hrv probes. the remaining  <dig> strains, representing near neighbor serotypes, were selected from diverse clades based on phylogenetic classification of hrv serotypes  <cit> . these strains were used to investigate the capability of the microarray to detect other hrv serotypes that did not have their sequences tiled on the microarray. overall, the selected strains covered every single clade of  <dig> hrv serotypes based on phylogenetic analysis of the p1–p <dig> regions of 5'utr sequences  <cit> . one metric of the hybridization in a reference region is to divide the number of bases reported as a, c, g, or t by the total number of bases for that region , which we refer to as the base call rate and proportionally reflects the hybridization strength or homology between the prototype and target sequences. a hybridization profile  using the base call rates clearly showed a unique pattern for each serotype. the closely related serotypes with less nucleotide divergences had similar hybridization profiles across the tiled regions, so it is possible to assign species  based only on the hybridization patterns. the brighter red spots  along the diagonal suggested that stronger hybridizations between the tiled probes and 5'utrs from the prototype serotypes. it is also of note that hrv <dig> does not fall into either of two major clusters which agrees with other findings that it should really be classified as a hev  <cit> . to validate the accuracy of the array clustering, 5'utr of each serotype was amplified by type-specific rt-pcr and subjected to conventional sequencing. the phylogenetic tree derived from the de novo 5'utr sequences  confirms the hrva and hrvb classification. pair-wise sequence comparisons also indicated that the average nucleotide divergence of 5'utr sequences between all  <dig> strains was  <dig> %. the maximal nucleotide divergences among hrva and hrvb strains were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. these results demonstrated that rpm-flu v.30/ <dig> chip is potentially capable of detecting genetically diverse hrv serotypes.

although useful, the visual patterns are difficult to discriminate the serotypes within each species and would require generating reference patterns for all hrv serotypes. the use of sequence calls and analysis software, cibsi  <cit> , allows for straightforward serotype identification. the sequence analysis results showed that the identifications made by rpm-flu v.30/ <dig> and cibsi are consistent with the reported typing, and could clearly differentiate most of the serotypes of the hrv . of the  <dig> hrv strains,  <dig> matched the selected prototype 5' utr sequences on the rpm-flu v.30/ <dig> chips and showed strong hybridization signals to their corresponding prototype regions generating at least 86% base call rates. due to the sequence homology, it is not surprising to find a noticeable and sometimes significant amount of hybridization  leading to base calls on prototype regions other than the correspondent prototype for most samples. because the identification scheme used was based on comparing the sequences generated on the array to database entries, this information could be integrated into the final identification. for these samples with high base call rates, the best hit would have tens to hundreds more matched bases than the next best hit. the remaining  <dig> atcc strains represent near neighbor serotypes, which 5'utr sequences share >80% identifies to those of prototypes. in all but the case of hrv <dig>  the information was sufficient to identify the correct serotypes. in these samples, the difference in the number of base calls matching in the best hit and the next best hit was more variable and on average was fewer. the confidence of the identification depends on the accuracy of the base call. since the best hit always had at least one base that matched the resequencing results and was a mismatch for the next best hit, it was possible to establish the lowest confidence level that the best hit was the correct identification. the resequencing microarray's accuracy for determining the base call has been established under a variety of conditions  <cit> . using this information, there is a .000001n that the next best hit is the most similar sequence in the database because a base is misidentified by the resequencing microarray where n is the number of mismatches between the next best hit and the matches for the best result. with .0001% being the largest level of uncertainty seen for these samples, it was deemed acceptable to treat the best hit as the correct identification. for hrv <dig>  several database sequences representing different serotypes had the same score and since no further information was available it was only possible to determine that a hrv species b was present. the 5'utr sequences from the tested strains generated with de novo sequencing were subjected to in silico predictive modeling analysis and the result of this was used as input in the cibsi analysis program. for the case of hrv <dig>  the in silico model predicted a larger fraction of base calls being made than were observed in the experiment. for all other samples there was a good correspondence on base call fractions between model and experiment as expected. this leads us to suspect there was a processing error or sample degradation leading to the less accurate identification.

specificity of rpm-flu v.30/ <dig> chip for hev detection and serotyping: design method 2
a panel of  <dig> hev serotypes, including serotypes from all four hev species, was similarly used to validate the specificity of rpm-flu v.30/ <dig> for hev detection and identification. these serotypes were originally typed based on vp <dig> sequences  and the majority of them belonged to members of hevb. the hybridization profile  shows distinct clusters in a similar fashion to the hrv samples based on serotypes. in this case, heva and hevb make up one cluster, while hevc and hevd  comprise a second cluster. this finding is consistent with the previously described clusters for hev utr sequences  <cit> . the redundancy of the targets that was a consequence of how they were selected is apparent in the more uniform response observed within each cluster to the various strains.

analysis of sequences reported from rpm-flu 30/ <dig> array analysis indicated that two levels of identifications were obtained from  <dig> strains . serotype level identification was made for  <dig> of the  <dig> strains, in which  <dig> cases correlated with typing made by the vp <dig> genes. for example, hev <dig> and coxsackievirus a <dig> , known to cause hand-foot-mouth disease, were unambiguously recognized as hev <dig> and cava <dig> respectively using rpm-flu v.30/ <dig> and analysis program. two strains were identified by rpm-flu v.30/ <dig> as hev <dig> and hev <dig>  results in agreement with the conventional sequencing of each 5'utr. however, the strains as provided by cdc were identified as hev <dig> and cavb <dig> respectively, based on the vp <dig> region. specific serotypes could not be identified for the remaining sixteen samples using the sequence read generated from the array. nevertheless these samples were easily categorized into the respective species. due to amplification problems only a subset of strains were successfully de novo sequenced, which showed  <dig> – 18% variations in 5'utr sequences. the base call rates obtained by in silico predictions based on the de novo sequences were similar to the microarray results and the identifications agreed in all but one case.

discussion
this study demonstrated the use of an algorithm for the design of probe sets based on an in silico predictive model  <cit> , developed by our group, that minimized the probes needed for detection and identification of most serotypes of hrv and hev. the potential of using resequencing microarray for simultaneous detection and identification of highly diverse respiratory pathogens, such as hrv and hev, was also demonstrated. the conserved nature of the 5' utr regions of hrv and hev genomes and the capabilities of the resequencing microarray allow serotype level identification of near-neighbor serotypes of hrv and hev, when long  sequences are read from the array. identifications can be still made for shorter length sequences to the species level particularly when the array has one or more such sequences derived from different probes.

the utility of the resequencing microarray is related to the target selection, the optimized prototype sequences represented on the array. in the case of rpm-flu v.30/ <dig>  the selection of hrv targets has proved to be very robust. the 5'utr has been shown in this study to be a good choice for serotyping hrv on rpm, as it performed similarly well on other platforms  <cit> . all hrv variants tested in this study could be detected and identified at least to the species level. the limited number of hrv sequences available in genbank during the time of design of rpm-flu v.30/ <dig> rendered a few of the targets represented on rpm-flu v.30/ <dig> are shorter than  <dig> bp. in the past year, complete genome sequences from  <dig> more serotypes and another two divergent hrv'x's have been reported  <cit> . it will be worthwhile to update the design for the next generation of the chip.

in the case of hev, the rpm-flu v.30/ <dig> assay identified only  <dig> of  <dig> strains tested at serotype level. several strains not producing serotype identifications might have been indicative of assay protocol issues or probe design. the fact that the in silico model prediction was also not serotype specific indicates it was most likely a design issue. this was further confirmed by agreement in base calls made from the resequencing microarray and from conventional resequencing. although all the strains of hev have complete genome sequences, there are also many partial sequence submissions for each strain in genbank that were ignored for the hev design. a re-examination of the 5'utr regions showed up to 14% difference in sequences grouped in the same serotype. this indicates that a redesign of the hev prototype regions is needed where selection of a minimal set of prototype regions would be based on all available 5'utr sequence data  and not a subset of genome sequences.

comparing the identifications made from de novo sequencing to the identifications made by cdc  illustrated another shortcoming of using the 5'utr region for hev that did not occur for hrv. oberste et al. demonstrated that typing based upon hev vp <dig> capsid gene sequences showed excellent correlation with serotype determined by classical antigenic methods  <cit> . thus amplification and sequencing of the partial vp <dig> amino-terminal coding region has been accepted as a standard molecular typing method for hev but such is not the case for the 5'utr region  <cit> . our results show that the 5'utr region did not correlate as closely as vp1-based typing to antigenic type definitions for hev unlike how it performed for hrv. while the 5'utr region is sufficient to accurately identify the groupings, a design using vp <dig> as the probe region is needed to provide serotyping identifications that will match classical methods.

the current rpm design can detect and identify a more comprehensive set of viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens in parallel, including detailed discrimination of certain serotypes of hrv and hev. this study showed that most shortcomings in the design were a result of not including adequate reference sequences for the initial design. the selection of vp <dig> and 3d regions also showed that incorporation of primer design considerations must be contemplated sooner in the design process than it has been currently done to prevent the selection of regions that cannot be used. future development will address these limitations by reducing hev probe redundancy and lack of coverage, by updating or confirming the hrv probes to be derived from newly available hrv sequences, and by involving primer design earlier in the overall design process.

CONCLUSIONS
a powerful feature of the expanded rpm-flu v.30/ <dig> resequencing pathogen microarray is that the nucleotide sequences generated from hybridization of the sample rna/dna and array-bound probe sets in conjunction with previously developed sequence analysis algorithm cibsi can be easily interpreted to make serotype or strain identifications. this feature and the platform's high resolution and high throughput aspects undoubtedly have great potential for use as a diagnostic tool, and therefore, efforts are currently underway to test the utility of this array on more clinical samples. the results presented also validated the usefulness of the design methodology and it is currently being applied to assist in a new microarray application associated with other genetically diverse viruses.
