BACKGROUND
there is growing interest in applying proteomics to organisms other than just those which are biomedically relevant and important species such as human, mouse or rat. however, one of the main hurdles for successful application of proteomics to an organism of interest is still the availability of a well annotated and curated  database that can be used to search the  proteomic data for protein identification in that organism. thus, the field of proteogenomics is becoming increasingly important because of its ability to support the annotation of genomic sequence data by exploiting the information that is obtained through proteomics for the identification and characterization of the actual products of gene expression  <cit> .

plant genomes can be highly complex and, in general, have been less well characterized than those from the animal kingdom, let alone those in the mammalian class, as mentioned above. for many plants, even those of high economic importance, the variability in the quality of available sequence databases can have a great effect on the power and depth of ms-based proteomic analysis. consequently, it is desirable to understand and overcome the above limitations, leading to a more informative data set which can be constructed from the vast amount of data that is commonly obtained from large-scale ms-based proteomic analyses. here, we have studied the organism artemisia annua, which is a chinese medicinal plant endemic to the northern parts of china. a. annua is crucial to world health programs as it is currently the sole source for biosynthetically produced artemisinin, the antimalarial pro-drug that has now been the last line of defence against malaria for several decades.

the sesquiterpene lactone, artemisinin, is the precursor for artemisinin-based combination therapies , which are the who-recommended treatment for p. falciparum malaria  <cit> . due to its unique mode of action, artemisinin has been found to be effective against the asexual  stage of the malarial parasite’s life cycle  <cit> , which has acquired resistance to the older generation of antimalarial drugs. between  <dig> and  <dig>  the number of act treatments procured by the public and private sectors in endemic countries rose 36-fold, reaching a total of  <dig> million in  <dig>  <cit> .

thus, the reliable supply of artemisinin as the precursor compound for the active ingredient of acts is of crucial importance in the fight against malaria. however, the current production of artemisinin is compromised by the fact that it is reliant on cultivation of a. annua. thus, in areas where a. annua is competing against food for use of the land, the rise in food prices will cause farmers/extractors to have less of an incentive to grow a. annua. furthermore, farmers/extractors need to decide whether or not to plant a. annua some 14 months before the drug can be produced. finally, floods such as those frequently experienced in china and vietnam make the supply of acts unpredictable  <cit> . taking these and other factors into account it is highly desirable to develop a method of production of artemisinin that is not dependent on a. annua cultivation, can be scaled up at short notice and is inexpensive.

in order to achieve these goals, two different approaches  are now described. one of these approaches is based on chemical synthesis of artemisinin from commercially available starting materials such as the monocyclic monoterpene, isopulegol. however, artemisinin production solely by such chemical means is complex and expensive, and therefore, has so far not supplanted the agricultural production of artemisinin as the favoured production method. an alternative to chemical synthesis is the employment of genetically engineered fast-growing organisms that produce artemisinin in high quantities. in this approach, the biosynthetic pathway to artemisinin needs to be expressed in an organism such as yeast by genetic modification of the host with the relevant genes from this pathway. there are several aspects of this bio-engineering approach that are important for its success, including the viability and fast growth of the engineered organism as well as the compartmentalization/secretion of the biosynthetic product in such a way that harvesting becomes an easy enterprise, to name but a few. for all this, a comprehensive knowledge of the biosynthetic pathway to artemisinin in a. annua is paramount, but unfortunately this goal has not yet been achieved . however, very significant advances have been achieved in spite of this, as demonstrated by two recent publications describing the bio-engineering of artemisinin-producing tobacco  <cit>  and that of artemisinic acid-producing yeast  <cit> . while the former concludes that current yields in tobacco are still significantly below the percentage dry weight levels obtainable from a. annua , the latter reports an incomplete biosynthesis to artemisinic acid, which then needs to be chemically converted to artemisinin. although great progress has been made recently using the latter approach  <cit> , it remains the case that expensive and complex chemical synthetic steps are still needed in the final stages of producing artemisinin.

crop-breeding programs, on the other hand, have produced new varieties of a. annua, such as artemis, with a consistently high yield of artemisinin ; and on-going projects are aiming to push this yield even higher. however, it is quite clear that both the crop-breeding and fermentation/chemical synthesis strategies would benefit from full knowledge of the biosynthetic route to artemisinin.

the biosynthesis of artemisinin is thought to be localized within the glandular trichomes of the plant which are found on the leaf surface  <cit> . trichomes are leaf hairs which originate from the protrusion of specialized epidermal cells on various parts of the plant, including leaves and stems. typically, trichomes are divided into  <dig> categories: non-glandular and glandular. non-glandular trichomes are involved in processes such as water absorption and seed dispersal, whereas glandular trichomes are involved in processes connected with secondary metabolites including biosynthesis, storage and secretion  <cit> . there is currently much interest in taking advantage of the glandular trichomes’ biosynthetic function in order to produce compounds, which have pharmaceutical use, such as artemisinin.

the glandular secretory trichome of a. annua is a 10-celled biseriate which consists of two basal cells, two stalk cells and three pairs of secretory cells. it is within this multi-cellular glandular trichome that biosynthesis of artemisinin occurs  <cit> . by comparing the amount of artemisinin extracted from glanded and glandless biotypes of a. annua, duke et al. revealed that all extractable artemisinin was localized in the subcuticular space of the captitate glands  <cit> . after extraction, no artemisinin was found in the glandless biotype, thereby implying that the biosynthesis of artemisinin is localized in the glandular secretory trichomes  <cit> .

the current study focuses on the analysis of the trichome proteome of a. annua, exploiting the recently published est and unigene sequence databases published by graham et al.  <cit> . this dataset is evaluated in comparison to four other databases  with regard to their suitability for proteomic analysis. in addition, a comparison is made with the only other ms-based proteomic study of a. annua trichomes, which used another different est data set assembly  <cit> . more importantly, the current study provides a significantly extended proteomic data set for a. annua, potentially leading to a better understanding of the trichome machinery and its role in the production of artemisinin.

RESULTS
isolation of glandular trichomes
the protocol that was applied for the isolation of glandular trichomes is based on the process of glass bead abrasion which has been described previously  <cit> . in these earlier studies, it was reported that the majority of the cell material enriched by this method represented glandular trichomes albeit with a significant remainder of non-glandular trichomes  <cit> . our simplified method, omitting the sucrose gradient fractionation, confirmed these findings as shown by environmental scanning electron microscopy  analysis , indicating that predominantly glandular trichome material had been obtained from the treated leaves. however, esem also revealed a significant number of glandular trichomes left on the leaf material after glass bead abrasion . it is assumed therefore that there are only small differences between the ‘trichome-depleted’ and 'whole leaf' samples. consequently, the data presented and discussed here are mainly based on the analysis of the ‘trichome-enriched’ material and its comparison solely with the ‘trichome-depleted’ sample material, as the technical replicate analysis of these samples showed a similarly low relative standard deviation of around  <dig>  % for the number of identified proteins. by contrast, this number was around 8 % for the 'whole leaf' replicate samples .

lc-ms/ms analysis
the triplicate lc-ms/ms runs showed that for all triplicates, the majority of protein identifications  were also obtained in the other two respective replicates, indicating an acceptable level of technical reproducibility. for the trichome-enriched sample analysis of the merged triplicate lc-ms/ms data a total of  <dig> contig ‘protein families’ entries  were significantly matched while for the trichome-depleted and whole leaf sample analysis this number was slightly higher at  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.

the greatest number of protein identifications was obtained by searching the york artemis contig database and the a. annua trichome trinity contig database. however, as there is no functional annotation provided in these databases, the data was also searched against the uniprotkb database, restricted to viridiplantae. these searches led to a total of  <dig> protein  identifications for the trichome-enriched samples  while for the trichome-depleted and whole leaf sample analysis this number was again slightly higher at  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.

decoy database searches using the default option in mascot  showed that the false discovery rate  for peptide matches above identity threshold was between  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % for all artemis contig decoy database searches while the fdr for the uniprotkb  decoy database search of the trichome-enriched sample data was ~9 % . interestingly, the fdr for the corresponding trinity contig database search was  <dig>  % .table  <dig> protein identification search results from the ms/ms data of trichome-enriched a. annua sample material

in general, the vast majority of proteins identified previously from a. annua by wu et al. were also found in our datasets  <cit> . notably, in the trichome-enriched sample data, we found amongst others a similarly large number of atpases/atp synthases and oxidoreductases , as well as many proteins involved in translation and transcription and also in proteolysis and the proteosome. furthermore, several kinases and phosphatases were also identified. figure  <dig> displays a rough molecular functional classification  of the uniprotkb -identified proteins from the trichome-enriched sample material after submission to percolator and setting the ‘expect cut-off’ threshold to  <dig> .fig.  <dig> functional classification  of the masoct-identified proteins from the trichome-enriched sample material, using the uniprotkb database . mascot search results were submitted to percolator with an ‘expect cut-off’ threshold of  <dig> 



importantly, several known and putative enzymes on the biosynthetic pathway to artemisinin have been found when searching the uniprotkb database entries restricted to the taxonomy a. annua. these include: peroxidase  <dig> , artemisinic aldehyde delta- <dig> reductase , amorpha- <dig> -diene synthase , 2-alkenal reductase , hmg-coa reductase , and putative heme-binding cytochrome p <dig> , as listed in table  <dig>  interestingly, most of these enzymes were not identified by searching the entire clade viridiplantae of the uniprotkb database. however, most of them and several other proteins related to the biosynthetic pathway to artemisinin were found searching the data against the contig database and by using the blastx search utility for functional annotation.table  <dig> significant protein matches obtained from searching ms/ms data of the trichome-enriched a. annua sample material 



although this study was first and foremost designed to investigate the usefulness of the york artemisia contig database and other databases for proteomic analyses, a preliminary comparison between the protein abundances of the trichome-enriched and trichome-depleted sample material was also thought to be useful for both  restricting the number of blast searches; and  providing some means of focusing on trichome- and thus potentially pathway-specific enzymes for further studies. in order to compare the protein abundances between the trichome-enriched and trichome-depleted sample material the contigs’ empai values were determined. for their calculated quotients, tables  <dig> and  <dig> present the  <dig> proteins that gave the highest and lowest values, respectively, while tables  <dig> and  <dig> present the  <dig> proteins with the highest empai values from the trichome-enriched sample material that were not detected in the trichome-depleted sample material and vice versa.table  <dig> highly abundant proteins of the trichome-enriched compared to the trichome-depleted sample material

discussion
the number of protein families identified in this study from trichome-enriched samples represents an increase by a factor of 7– <dig> when compared to the protein identification data achieved by the only other previously published larger proteomics study with a. annua by wu et al.  <cit> . the increase is even higher  if these results are compared to the est search results of “non-redundant” protein hits in the earlier study  <cit> . this order-of-magnitude increase in proteome coverage is arguably due to the different technical approaches adopted  and also to the databases which have been employed. for instance, the study by wu et al. was restricted to the separation of proteins by 2de using a ph gradient of 4– <dig>  <cit> . for the databases used in the present study, the translated york contig database searched by mascot comprises  <dig> , <dig> residues, which equates to an average of ~ <dig> residues per translated contig sequence, while wu et al. used an in-house est database, resulting in  <dig> , <dig> residues and  <dig> , <dig> sequences, i.e. an average of ~ <dig>  residues per translated est sequence. the greater fragmentation  of the latter database negatively affects protein identification, which is partially reflected in the different individual ion scores that were necessary for identity or extensive homology  in the two studies. for the present study, these had to be only > <dig>  while in the study by wu et al. this threshold was reported to be > <dig>  <cit> .

the results obtained from the ms/ms data searches using different databases  demonstrate the importance of the availability and quality of organism-specific  sequence data for proteomic analysis. when the ncbinr database was searched with the taxonomy restriction of viridiplantae, i.e. similarly to the work of wu et al.  <cit> ,  <dig> protein family matches were obtained with an fdr of  <dig>  %. searching a custom database restricted to the uniprotkb entries for a. annua  resulted in  <dig> protein family hits for the trichome-enriched sample data with  <dig> peptide matches above identity threshold for the decoy database search, i.e. an fdr of  <dig>  %. the highest fdr  was obtained from the uniprotkb  decoy database search.

interestingly, the trinity trichome contig database search of the ms/ms data of the trichome-enriched sample material  yielded a slightly higher number of protein family hits compared to the york artemis contig database search  but had far less peptides matched above the identity threshold and a substantially higher fdr  as well as  <dig> more peptides matched above the identity threshold in the decoy database search, potentially negating the slightly higher number of protein family hits. thus, the york artemis contig database appears to be the best sequence database for proteomic analyses.

overall, the above analysis shows that using large common protein sequence databases, even if well curated and/or for proteomic analysis restricted to a specific organism or clade, can easily result in high false discovery rates for organisms that have been less well sequenced and characterized. they also show that high quality  sequence information for these organisms provides a significant advantage if one wants to achieve greater proteome coverage and lower numbers of spurious protein identifications.

the protein abundance analysis between the trichome-enriched and -depleted samples using their empai values shows that peroxidases have far greater abundance within the trichome-enriched sample material. this data could be relevant for the elucidation of the final  step in the biosynthesis of artemisinin , which is thought to proceed most likely via the precursor of dihydroartemisinic acid and its derived tertiary allylic hydroperoxide. it has been found that all the reactions depicted in the final phase of the biosynthesis of artemisinin in fig.  <dig> can proceed non-enzymatically in vitro, and it has been suggested that this might also be the case in vivo. however, the over-expression of peroxidases arguably indicates the involvement of enzymes in this final step in the biosynthesis of artemisinin.fig.  <dig> the biosynthesis of artemisinin, as it is currently best understood, depicted in three phases. enzymes in red were identified through mascot searches of the ms data using the taxonomy a. annua while enzymes in blue were identified using the taxonomy viridiplantae. for the latter, if needed, additional homology searching was applied, using blastp with ‘artemisia’ as organism . aact – acetoacetyl-coa thiolase; hmgs – -3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coa synthase; hmgr – -3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coa reductase; mvak – mevalonate kinase; mvapk – mevalonate-5-phosphate kinase; mpd - mevalonate-5-pyrophosphate decarboxylase; fps – farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase; ads – amorpha- <dig> -diene synthase; cyp71av <dig> - amorpha- <dig> -diene 12-hydroxylase; dbr <dig> – artemisinic aldehyde Δ <dig>  reductase; aldh <dig> – aldehyde dehydrogenase 1



in addition, cyclophilins which usually catalyse the isomerisation of peptidic bonds from the trans to the cis form at proline residues were found to be in greater abundance in the trichome-enriched sample material.

in general, there seemed to be a relatively higher level of ribosomal proteins, atp/glutamate synthases, and proteins with transporter and electron carrier activity in the trichome-depleted sample material . this is probably partly due to the dominance of the above-described proteins in the trichome-enriched sample material, which catalyse trichome-specific biosynthetic and metabolic processes. as can be seen in fig.  <dig> for the top 10/ <dig> most abundant proteins, there is a far greater number in the categories ‘oxidoreductase/antioxidant activity’ and ‘other catalytic activity’ for the trichome-enriched sample material than for the trichome-depleted sample material.

finally, in both trichome-enriched and trichome-depleted samples there was a significant background of chloroplastic proteins associated with photosynthetic processes, which conforms with a previous a. annua transcriptomics study, where a large number of transcripts matching photosynthetic homologues were indentified  <cit> . there were comparatively more photosynthesis-related proteins in the trichome-depleted samples, which can be simply explained by the relatively lower number of chloroplast-containing cells in trichome-enriched samples.

a large number of the known enzymes on the biosynthetic pathway to artemisinin has been detected by combining the information from the two uniprotkb database searches  – using the taxonomy viridiplantae and a. annua, respectively . the biosynthesis of artemisinin, as it is currently best understood, is summarized in three phases as shown in fig.  <dig>  with the enzymes that catalyze each step indicated above each arrow in black. enzymes appearing in red below each arrow were identified in the a. annua taxonomy search  and enzymes appearing in blue were identified in the viridiplantae search, and for the latter, if needed, by homology searching using blastp with ‘artemisia’ as organism --ß-caryophyllene synthase), uniprot # p <dig> -δ-cadinene synthase), uniprot # q2epz <dig> , uniprot # q <dig>  and uniprot # q9zpb <dig> ).

in phase  <dig> of the biosynthesis of artemisinin, hmgr  <cit>  catalyzes the first transformation in the mevalonate pathway, which is irreversible under physiological conditions, and thereby constitutes a key committed step in the biosynthesis of sesquiterpenes  in the cytosol of higher plants. ads  <cit>  at the end of phase 1/beginning of phase  <dig> again catalyzes a committed step which channels the metabolic flux towards the amorphane sesquiterpenes  and away from triterpenes and alternative cyclic sesquiterpene skeletons that are common in a. annua .

it has been known for several years now that the series of three sequential oxidations which converts amorpha- <dig> -diene to artemisinic acid  in phase  <dig> of the biosynthesis, is catalyzed by a single cytochrome p <dig>  designated cyp71av <dig>  <cit> . the cytochrome p450s identified from this study, as accession numbers q <dig> and q2epz <dig>  may represent this same enzyme. more recently, it has become clear that dihydroartemisinic acid  <cit> , not artemisinic acid  <cit> , is the true precursor to artemisinin at the start of phase  <dig> of the biosynthesis. it has been proposed that dbr <dig> converts artemisinic aldehyde to the alternative product, dihydroartemisinic aldehyde  <cit> . the 2-alkenal reductase  identified in this study should catalyse this same reaction, and may be involved at this step or was simply identified due to its close homology to dbr <dig>  an aldehyde dehydrogenase such as q9zpb <dig> is then required to convert dihydroartemisinic aldehyde to dihydroartemisinic acid  <cit> .

there is still considerable uncertainty as to the identities of the intermediates involved in the third phase of the biosynthesis of artemisinin, as well as the enzymatic or non-enzymatic nature of these transformations. what is known is that dihydroartemisinic acid can be converted non-enzymatically to artemisinin via an initial oxygenation to the corresponding tertiary allylic hydroperoxide, followed by hock cleavage, and a second oxidative reaction on the resultant enolic intermediate  <cit> . however, it is still not clear whether a similar series of spontaneous oxidations occurs in planta, or whether enzymes are present to catalyze some steps in this pathway . in this regard, it is very interesting indeed to note the high trichome-specific expression of peroxidase  <dig>  which must be a strong candidate as catalyst for the first  oxidation reaction which is proposed in fig.  <dig>  if an enzyme were to be involved.

CONCLUSIONS
using the example of a. annua, we have provided further evidence that the choice of sequence database is crucial for successful proteomic analysis. compared to previously published proteomic data for a. annua, we have now shown for the example of a medicinal plant that the employment of an organism-specific database that has undergone extensive curation, leading to longer est sequences, can greatly increase the number of true positive protein identifications, while reducing the number of false positives.

most importantly, the presented results substantially increase the  proteome data available for a. annua. an order-of-magnitude more proteins have been identified for trichome-enriched samples, including proteins which are known to be involved in the biosynthesis of artemisinin, as well as other highly abundant proteins, which suggest additional enzymatic processes within the trichomes that are important for the biosynthesis of artemisinin. in particular, the high trichome-specific expression of peroxidases suggests strong enzymatic oxidation activity in trichomes, potentially allowing for effective oxidative reactions in the final phase of the biosynthesis of artemisinin, which have so far been thought to be non-enzymatic in nature.
