BACKGROUND
the accumulating body of draft genome assemblies from diverse animal species offers unprecedented opportunities for resolving the tree of life. a key component of empirical studies of molecular evolutionary phenomena is the analysis of molecular markers. to date, most molecular phylogenetic studies have relied on sequences from less than a few dozen genes. mitochondrial dna sequences have been the workhouse of phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies for the past two decades . dna barcoding, a technique is increasingly used to identify species, is reliant on mtdna  <cit> . while these methods have strengths, each carries some implicit limitations. first, because mtdna markers are maternally inherited, the ability to infer evolutionary events from the perspective of both sexes is limited. in addition, the reduced effective population size of mtdna compared to that of nuclear markers could confound population genetic inferences. moreover, it is now well established that mtdna sequences are often incorporated into nuclear genomes in diverse taxa, including humans and other primates  <cit> .

markers from single-copy nuclear dna are free from the aforementioned problems. often used single-copy nuclear dna markers include conserved exons and genes. however, the effects of natural selection on these markers can result in homoplasy that has the potential to mislead phylogenetic analyses  <cit> . similarly, genes that experienced positive selection in specific lineages  may have inaccurate phylogenetic signals . conversely, genes that have a history of strong purifying selection may harbor few phylogenetically informative sites, which make them unsuitable for population genetic studies or phylogenetic resolution in rapidly evolving taxa.

in addition to sequence based markers, events such as the insertion of transposable elements into ancient genomes provide excellent phylogenetic information  <cit> ; yet these markers provides little information on rates of nucleotide substitution. because of these limitations, neutrally evolving nuclear dna sequence markers may provide the best source of data for phylogenetic inference and estimates of evolutionary rate variation.

advances in genomics give molecular evolutionary studies an extraordinary opportunity to establish numerous nuclear, putatively neutral molecular markers. genomes of many taxa, including those of primates, have a large amount of non-coding dna, which can be used to infer genomic divergence and the influence of neutral mutation rate variation  <cit> . therefore, we can obtain large numbers of putatively nuclear molecular markers from non-coding regions. even though currently most taxa lack genome scale information, sequencing technologies are rapidly improving, and it will become progressively easier to obtain genome sequences. the challenges then are, to utilize genomic information to develop markers that can be used in a variety of ecological, phylogenetic, and evolutionary applications.

here we present a method for developing and utilizing numerous non-coding, non-repetitive markers in primates. the availability of whole-genome sequences of primates combined with their well-resolved phylogenetic relationships makes them an excellent model system in which to devise computational and experimental tools to search for useful molecular markers. moreover, such markers from primate genomes are potentially useful because they could be applied to the several outstanding phylogenetic problems in primates . such molecular markers also could serve as a resource for understanding the genetic history of primate populations, a topic of study of interest to molecular ecologists, primate biologists, and anthropologists.

we demonstrate the utility of these markers by applying them to phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses. we first constructed a sample data set of ten non-coding, non-repetitive markers from ten diverse primate taxa, including a strepsirrhine species rather distantly related to existing genomic resources. we reconstructed the correct species phylogeny with high confidence and uncovered significant evolutionary rate variation between lineages. furthermore, we have uncovered new and statistically significant rate variation between some primate lineages. thus, our markers may contribute understanding the patterns and causes of neutral evolutionary rate variation between lineages. we propose that the methods outlined here can be used in diverse taxa to address phylogenomic and population genetic questions.

RESULTS
amplification of potential markers
our preliminary screen for orthologous non-repetitive and non-coding segments based on a three-way alignment the genomes of two hominid apes  and the rhesus macaque  resulted in nearly  <dig>  candidate amplicons. subsequently, we designed  <dig>  primer pairs in regions ranging from ~ <dig> to ~ <dig> base pairs long, with an average length of ~ <dig> bps.

we then used the polymerase chain reaction  to amplify these markers from the following primate species: gorilla , anubis baboon , spider monkey  and tamarin , and ring-tailed lemur . two hundred primer pairs  amplified a single band from g. gorilla,  <dig> primer pairs  amplified a single band for p. anubis,  <dig>  and  <dig>  primer pairs amplified a single band for a. geoffroyi and s. labiatus respectively. furthermore, we amplified single bands in  <dig> markers , from a phylogenetically distant clade from the genome resources, l. catta. sequences, locations in the human genome, and the applicable range of phylogeny of these markers  are listed the additional file  <dig> .

we chose  <dig> markers  for subsequent analyses . these markers are likely to be orthologous, for the following reasons. first, these ten markers are unique genomic regions in the human genome . second, primers for all the ten markers produced single bands in pcr reactions in the primate species we tested. third, when we used the experimentally amplified sequences as a query to search other genomes using blat or blast programs, all of these produced a single hit in the expected locations. fourth, genetic divergences of these markers also fall within the expected ranges of neutrally evolving orthologous markers . however, we caution that it is possible that these markers are not orthologous, given that most primate genomes are far from complete, and that unknown copy number variation may exist between and within species. thus, whether the amplified markers of these regions from other primate genomes truly represent orthologous segments can only be determined by comparing finished, high-fold coverage, whole genome sequences from multiple individuals of the primate species in our study. the markers amplified and sequenced in this study are deposited in the genbank .

we also retrieved these  <dig> regions from the publicly available genome sequences of the following five species: human , common chimpanzee , orangutan , rhesus macaque , and the common marmoset . all sequences, except for the x <dig> marker from the chimpanzee and the a <dig> marker from macaque, were of high quality . the chimpanzee x <dig> and the macaque a <dig> marker had a substantial number of ambiguous sites, suggesting that the two particular markers may potentially include sequencing and/or assembly errors. therefore, we experimentally amplified the two regions from the corresponding species and used them in further analyses.

subsequent analyses were all based on these  <dig> markers. we used the gblocks program  <cit>  to remove poorly aligned sites. the alignment information and nucleotide content of the markers are shown in table  <dig>  a <dig> had the longest alignment with  <dig> aligned sites. the gc content of the  <dig> markers ranged from  <dig> % in a <dig> to  <dig> % in a <dig>  with an average of  <dig> % for the concatenated dataset. we tested whether base frequencies across taxa are homogenous using a chi-square test for each of the  <dig> markers and found no sign of heterogeneity among taxa .

genetic divergence
to estimate the genomic divergence for these newly determined markers, we calculated the pairwise kimura two-parameter distances  <cit>  among the  <dig> primate species. a subset of pairwise divergences is shown in table  <dig>  all pairwise distances for the species compared here are shown in the additional file  <dig> .

note. c = chimpanzee, h = human, g = gorilla, o = orangutan, ba = baboon, mc = macaque, mr = marmoset, sm = spider monkey, ta = tamarin, lm = lemur, hom = hominoids, nwm = new world monkey, owm = old world monkey.

there is a substantial variation of evolutionary distances among markers. for example, the distance between human and chimpanzee ranges from  <dig> % in a <dig> to  <dig> % in x <dig>  such regional heterogeneity has been observed before and could be caused by several different factors, such as the difference in the proportion of sites susceptible to mutations caused by dna methylation  <cit> . nevertheless, this variation is within the range of 0%– <dig> % observed in previous studies using non-repetitive and non-coding regions  <cit> . the mean human-chimpanzee divergence from these  <dig> segments is  <dig> % ±  <dig> %, which is close to previous estimates . thus, non-coding, non-repetitive markers developed in this study exhibit genetic divergences similar to those obtained from larger scale analyses.

we report that the divergence between baboon and macaque is  <dig> % ±  <dig> % for the concatenated dataset . this value is similar to an earlier estimate . within the new world monkeys, marmoset and tamarin are more closely related to each other  than either is to the spider monkey . this observation is concordant with the generally accepted understanding of platyrrhine phylogeny  <cit> .

we also estimated genetic distances between different primate groups, defined as the mean of all pairwise distances between two groups in a inter-group comparison  <cit> . the average divergences between apes and old world monkeys, apes and new world monkeys, and old world monkeys and new world monkeys are  <dig> % ±  <dig> %,  <dig> % ±  <dig> %, and  <dig> % ±  <dig> %, respectively. notably, genetic divergences between the spider monkey and the other two new world monkeys  are comparable to the divergence between apes and old world monkeys .

our data also provide a chance to examine the genetic divergence between ring-tailed lemur and other primate groups based upon nuclear, non-coding, non-repetitive loci. hominid apes, old world monkeys and new world monkeys are on average  <dig> % ±  <dig> %,  <dig> % ±  <dig> % and  <dig> % ±  <dig> % divergent from the ring-tailed lemur based on our data. previous studies suggested approximately 20–21% divergence between human and the ring-tailed lemur  <cit> . our estimate of the genetic distance between hominids and the ring-tailed lemur is similar to this value, and these findings also show that old world monkeys and new world monkeys have diverged slightly more from lemur than have the apes.

phylogenetic analysis
we performed phylogenetic analyses using the new markers generated in this study. we used maximum parsimony , neighbor joining , and bayesian inference  methods to construct phylogenetic trees for each of the  <dig> markers. the best-fitting substitution model for each marker for bayesian inference  was determined by the akaike information criterion  as implemented in modeltest <dig>   <cit>  and mrmodeltest <dig>   <cit>  . we also performed phylogenetic analyses using the three methods and a maximum likelihood  method of the concatenated data set.

overall, none of these methods strongly supported conflicting topologies for any single marker. however, individual-marker analyses were less well resolved than the tree based on the concatenated data . figure  <dig> represents the total evidence tree obtained from mp, nj, ml, and bi of the concatenated dataset. all the methods recovered identical topology with 100% bootstrap value or  <dig>  bayesian posterior probability support for all clades, except for node  <dig> . this tree agrees with the current understanding of the primate species tree in most aspect.

the behavior of combining characters from different partitions was evaluated by examining the relative contribution, or utility, of data partitions to resolving relationships of the combined data set. specifically, partitioned bremer support  was calculated using treerot <dig>  <cit>  using the method of baker and desalle  <cit>  to measure the relative contribution of each marker to node support. the larger the partitioned bremer support is for a given partition at a particular node, the greater the relative contribution of that partition to the support of that node. the sum of all partition lengths for any given node will always equal to the decay index for that node on the total evidence tree  <cit> .

the results of the pbs analysis are presented in table  <dig>  the pbs values for  <dig> nodes across all the  <dig> markers and summed pbs scores for each marker are presented to evaluate the contribution of a given marker to the overall support of the simultaneous analysis tree. in order of total level of support, marker a <dig> shows the highest degree of support  for the simultaneous analysis tree, while a <dig> shows the lowest degree of support . for comparison, we also summarized the relative contribution of the support for the total autosomal markers  and x chromosomal makers , the concatenated dataset from the six autosomal markers shows a larger contribution  to the whole tree than that from the four x chromosomal markers  .

note. all marker rows show the pbs for each marker for the corresponding nodes shown in figure  <dig> 

relative rate variation in primates
to determine whether the rates of nucleotide substitutions for these  <dig> non-coding fragments varied between lineages on the phylogenetic tree, we performed relative rate tests. for example, to examine rate difference between apes and old world monkeys, we used marmoset  or the ring-tailed lemur  as the outgroup .

notes.  <dig>  k <dig>  number of substitutions per site that lineage  <dig> accumulated starting from the split with lineage 2; dk, the difference between k <dig> and k <dig> numbers of substitutions; sd_dk, standard deviation for dk; p, significance value for differences in substitution rates between lineage  <dig> and lineage 2; ratio, the ratios of the branch length leading to the lineage  <dig> to that leading to the lineage  <dig> since the divergence of the two lineages.

 <dig>  hom = hominoids, owm = old world monkey, nwm = new world monkey.

 <dig>  *significant at  <dig>  level; **significant at  <dig>  level; ***significant at  <dig>  level.

pairs of lineages that exhibit significant rate differences are presented in table  <dig>  we observe that the old world monkey lineage  is evolving significantly faster than the ape lineage. the lengths of old world monkey-specific branch are 30–50% longer than the ape-specific branch since their divergence, depending upon the choice of the outgroup . this finding is in accord with the repeatedly observed 'hominoid/hominid-rate slowdown' phenomenon  <cit> .

interestingly, we found that the macaque lineage is evolving significantly faster than the baboon lineage since the divergence of the two old world monkey lineages. in the ten markers studied here  the macaque lineage has accumulated almost twice as many nucleotide substitutions as has the baboon lineage. indeed, analyses of encode data have shown that the branch length leading to macaque is significantly longer than that leading to baboon  <cit> . another recent study using over  <dig> million base pairs of aligned genomic sequences among several old world monkeys also indicated significant rate difference between rhesus macaque and baboon  <cit> . overall, new world monkeys evolve at a faster rate than the hominids . we also discovered significant rate variation among new world monkeys. in particular, marmoset has a significantly faster substitution rate  than the spider monkey .

these findings indicate that significant rate variation between lineages is a common feature of primate genome evolution. based upon the known differences in life history traits , the observed rate differences are in general in agreement with the idea that species with larger body size, and likely longer generation time, tend to have slower molecular clocks. baboons are larger and have longer lifespans than macaques, and spider monkey are larger and have longer lifespans than marmosets.

taken together, these findings not only suggest a widespread influence of life history traits on molecular evolution of primates, but also provide a practical explanation on the fact that the degree of rate difference between specific primate groups can differ depending upon the actual lineages compared. for example, the hominid rate slowdown is more pronounced when rates are compared between human and macaque than between human and baboon , which is in accord with the rate difference between macaque and baboon.

discussion
genomics is arguably one of the fastest evolving branches of modern science. emerging new sequencing technologies enable analyses of large number of individuals from a species or to interrogate genetic diversity of a complex biological community. yet, aside from the fields of microbial genomics and human population genomics, for most taxa on earth only a sparse amount of genomic resources are available.

developing genome-scale markers from the majority of the diversity of life will have high payoff, facilitating ecological and evolutionary applications. here we have illustrated that we can develop markers from specific genomic regions  utilizing genomic resources that are moderately divergent from target species. for example, studies estimate that the human/chimpanzee/macaque and the ring-tailed lemur has shared the last common ancestor up to  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . here we have generated markers from potentially neutral genomic regions in ring-tailed lemurs using primers based upon human-chimpanzee-macaque genome alignments.

as far as we are aware, data from non-coding regions of strepsirrhines are rare, and markers developed in this study have a great potential to be used in evolutionary studies of this group. importantly, we demonstrated that we could potentially achieve genome scale marker generation by sampling genomes across the tree of life with moderate divergence times.

we chose primates as the test group of organisms for this study because their phylogenetic relationships are well characterized  <cit> . we felt that if we could replicate the known primate phylogeny using the markers we designed then we would have proof of principle that this type of marker was useful for phylogenetic analysis. toward that end this study was successful. using a subset of new markers, we have performed phylogenetic analyses. the resulting phylogenies from single markers were generally in accord with the accepted phylogenetic relationship among different primate species. in particular, no marker supported incorrect phylogeny with statistical significance. the only node that required several markers to be resolved was the relationship among human, chimpanzee, and gorilla, a notorious phylogenetic example that had previously been shown to require a large amount of data to be resolved  <cit> . given that there are several outstanding problems remaining in the field of primate phylogeny , putatively neutral markers such as developed in this study potentially will be useful toward resolving these issues.

previous work focusing on identifying conserved, ultraconserved, or lineage specific elements for their potential functionality  have recognized the usefulness of utilizing regions located distantly from annotate genes as putatively 'neutral' standards to generate statistical 'background' for their analysis. our approach, while seeking to identify regions of the genome that are not under functional constraint instead, have adopted such underlying logic and applied it to species whose genomic sequences are not yet available. it should be cautioned however that computational logics identifying putatively 'neutral' markers do not guarantee true neutrality: it remains as a prime challenge in modern genomics to experimentally establish neutrality or functionality of non-coding regions.

it has recently been demonstrated that protein coding regions are subject to frequent and widespread parallel evolution  <cit> ; therefore we attempted to choose regions that are less likely to be subject to homoplastic effects that could result in misleading phylogenies. that our results support the well-known topology of primates  is encouraging, because our understanding of primate phylogeny has taken over a century to get to the point is at today. there are still phylogenetic controversies  that still resist resolution besides decades of work.

using the newly developed markers, we also observed substantial evolutionary rate variation among different primate lineages. we not only confirm the phenomenon of hominid rate slowdown  <cit> , but also uncovered several other intriguing patterns. in particular, we observe that since the divergence of rhesus macaque and anubis baboon , the macaque lineage has accumulated almost twice as many mutations as the baboon lineage. substantial rate variation between old world monkey lineages could have contributed to earlier controversy over the degree of hominid rate slowdown. when the macaque lineage is used to compare evolutionary rates of hominids and old world monkeys, the degree of rate slowdown is much stronger . we also observed a strong rate difference between marmoset and spider monkey, and to a lesser degree between tamarin and spider monkey. the marmoset lineage has accumulated almost 50% more mutations than the spider monkey lineage since the two lineages have split . thus, evolutionary rate variation is a common phenomenon in putatively neutral genomic regions  <cit> .

the relative rate test shows that mutations have accumulated in the old world monkey and new world monkey lineage at a rate significantly higher than in the hominids. we found no significant evolutionary rate difference between old world monkeys and new world monkeys, in contrast to an earlier finding  <cit> . however, we should be careful in concluding the patterns of rate variation between groups based upon data from a few lineages. first there is the issue of regional rate variation within a genome. also, as we have witnessed above, rates can vary dramatically between closely related lineages . the earlier analysis on rate variation between marmoset and old world monkeys  <cit>  was based upon a single, albeit long , orthologous region. the new world monkey species used in the previous analysis was marmoset, a fast evolving lineage. thus the previous finding of significant rate variation between old world monkeys and new world monkeys  <cit>  may reflect the underlying molecular clock specific to that genomic regions and the sets of species. in this respect expanding the usage of non-coding, non-repetitive markers from many different genomic regions as developed here to other primate lineages will be highly useful to reconcile these conflicting results and to elucidate the patterns and causes of genomic neutral molecular clocks in primates.

the markers developed in this study  should thus be of great use for ecological and evolutionary applications in primates. in particular a subset of markers from closely related species can be used as 'local' markers to elucidate recent evolutionary events, while a few markers that can be amplified throughout the evolution of primates  could be used as 'global' markers to analyze underlying trends in primate evolution.

CONCLUSIONS
molecular markers from nuclear, putatively neutrally evolving genomic regions are extremely useful in ecological and evolutionary applications, yet hard to obtain from the majority of taxa. here we describe a method for developing numerous nuclear markers from putatively neutral regions of primate genomes. first we demonstrate that by combining computational and experimental methods, we can generate a large number of putatively neutral markers from diverse primate genomes. our pcr analyses show that we can amplify numerous markers from several well-separated primate lineages. we chose a subset of ten markers among the newly developed markers and amplified them from five primate species. notably, we were able to amplify and sequence a subset of these markers from a ring-tailed lemur, representing a lineage that diverged from the lineage leading species from which the primers were designed  <dig> million years ago. we show that these ten markers can reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships among the ten primate species with high confidence, and useful in analyses of evolutionary rate variation between lineages. in particular we uncovered substantial rate variation among lineages, both within and between different primate families. thus, these markers can provide a snapshot of genomic divergences and are likely to be highly useful in diverse applications.
