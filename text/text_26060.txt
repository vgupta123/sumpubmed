BACKGROUND
flavonoids are a large, diverse group of plant phenolic compounds involved in a variety of biological responses to the biotic and abiotic environment, such as disease resistance, seed dormancy, pigmentation of flowers and fruits, protection against uv-b damage, and reduction of insect and mammalian herbivory  <cit> . the anthocyanin pigments that are produced by a branch of the flavonoid pathway are important as insect and animal attractants, for pollination and seed dispersal. however, they are also of increasing importance as quality traits in commercial fruit crops, not only for the colours they produce but also for their potential human health benefits. a wide range of cell culture experiments, animal trials and epidemiological studies have linked intake of anthocyanins with reduced risk for a range of health problems, including heart disease, cancer, diabetes and degenerative conditions such as alzheimer's disease  <cit> .

as flavonoids contribute to many different functions at various times in a plant, a complex system of regulation is required to direct temporal and spatial production in response to developmental and environmental stimuli. the primary point of regulation of flavonoid production occurs at the transcriptional level, through activation or repression of the biosynthetic genes by a conserved group of transcription factors . in all plants studied to date, activation of the anthocyanin pathway is through a 'mbw complex' consisting of r2r3-myb and bhlh tfs and a wd-repeat  protein that may facilitate protein-protein interactions  <cit> . in addition to the mybs that are part of the activation complex, distinct r2r3- and r3-mybs with a repressive action have been identified that may allow for feedback modulation of the amount of anthocyanin produced  <cit> .

based on previous studies, it seems likely that variation in activity of the r2r3-myb genes is key to determining the spatial and temporal patterning of anthocyanin production in most plant species  <cit> . the r2r3-myb and bhlh families of transcription factors are two of the largest in plants, with  <dig> and  <dig> members respectively, in arabidopsis <cit> . the r2r3-mybs that activate anthocyanin biosynthesis have diverged during evolution to control anthocyanin production only in response to specific stimuli or with a high degree of spatial specificity. r2r3-myb genes have been identified that are associated with activating anthocyanin biosynthesis in flowers, fruits, or vegetative tissues  <cit> . genetic changes affecting individual members of the r2r3-myb or bhlh gene families can thus result in tissue-specific changes in anthocyanin production. the identification of the r2r3-myb and bhlh genes associated with anthocyanin production in a particular species is therefore an important step towards elucidating the genetic control of pigmentation in that species.

petals of the kiwifruit species actinidia chinensis planch. var. chinensis are white or cream, shading to apricot during senescence, while those of a. eriantha benth. are typically pink or red, although a white-flowered form has been found in china  <cit> . f <dig> hybrids from crosses between tetraploid a. chinensis var. chinensis and a. eriantha are known to produce red flowers  <cit> . zhang et al.  studied the segregation of flower colour among  <dig> seedlings from a cross between hexaploid a. chinensis var. deliciosa and a diploid male f <dig> hybrid between diploid a. eriantha and tetraploid a. chinensis var. chinensis <cit> . the seedlings could be broadly classified into those with red and those with white-coloured petals, suggesting the action of a small number of genes. however, because of the complexity of the pedigree, the small number of seedlings and the presence of intermediate types with red and white petals, no firm conclusions could be drawn about the inheritance of petal colour. fan et al.  studied the flower colour of  <dig> seedlings obtained from a cross between hexaploid a. chinensis var. deliciosa and diploid a. eriantha <cit> . female seedlings all had white flowers while the male seedlings had red, white or peach and white flowers. the authors reached no conclusion regarding inheritance of petal colour.

in this paper, we report the results from a study of petal colour in two families of  x a. chinensis var. chinensis  hybrids and two families of a. chinensis var. chinensis x a. eriantha) x a. chinensis var. chinensis  hybrids . the scale of the population and its genetic structure, and the ability to access a large expressed sequence tag  database for actinidia species in which to seek candidate regulatory genes, enabled us to examine the genetic control of petal colour in these hybrids  <cit> .

RESULTS
the phenotyping of petal colour of the four backcross families
the ratio of vines with red or white petals in each of the four families was not significantly different from 1: <dig>  and there were no significant differences in petal colour ratio among families  , or between sexes within families . this result would suggest that, in these hybrid families, petal colour inheritance is a monogenic dominant trait.

segregation for petal colour and gender in two families of backcross seedlings of  x a. chinensis var. chinensis , and two families of backcross seedlings of  x a. chinensis var. chinensis . the ratio of red to white petal colour of approximately 1: <dig> suggests that in petals of these hybrid families colour inheritance is a monogenic dominant trait.

among progeny vines with red petals, some variation was observed in the intensity of red colouration between vines and many had much darker red petals than those of their f <dig> hybrid parent or a. eriantha grandparent . intensity of colour usually declined from the base of the petal to the fringe. however, there was very little variation between flowers within each vine.

of  <dig> vines scored for the colour of the ovary pericarp tissue, only  <dig> had red colouration, of which four showed intense red colour. these  <dig> vines all belonged to the same family  and thus had the same parentage. ovary colour was independent of petal colour. stamen filament colour was also independent of petal and ovary colour. red filaments were found with both red or white petals, and red or green ovaries, in all combinations in female progeny, and with red or white petals in males .

of  <dig> female vines screened for fruit flesh colour, only four had fruit with some red colouration and the red colour was faint and confined to the area around the core towards the pedicel end of the fruit. there was no obvious association between red colour in the ovary, petals, filaments or fruit flesh.

quantification and identification of anthocyanins and flavonols extracted from red petals of individual genotypes
in all four families there was variation in hue among the red-petalled genotypes . as dihydroxyflavonols are substrates for production of flavonols, pro-anthocyanidins and anthocyanins, and because flavonols are known to act as co-pigments affecting hue, the amounts of these compounds were assayed at the same time as the anthocyanins .

eight anthocyanins were detected in red petal tissue. two of these were classified as delphinidin-based and three as cyanidin-based, while the identities of three anthocyanins that were present in small quantities were not determined . the concentration of all compounds was recorded as mg.g- <dig> fresh weight of petal tissue. the delphinidin-based anthocyanins, delphinidin 3-o-galactoside  and delphinidin 3-o-galactoside , were present in only  <dig> of the  <dig> genotypes sampled, and family  <dig> progeny did not contain delphinidin compounds. families  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> had  <dig> genotypes with dp-xylgal only and  <dig> genotypes with dp-gal only, while family  <dig> also had five genotypes with both delphinidins . the three cyanidin-based anthocyanins identified were cyanidin 3-o-galactoside , cyanidin 3-o-galactoside  and cyanidin 3-o-glucoside . when summed, anthocyanins ranged in concentration from  <dig>  mg.g- <dig> to  <dig>  mg.g- <dig>  with the higher concentrations reflected in the depth of petal colour. cy-gal and cy-glu were the two most commonly occurring identified anthocyanins, and acn-unk <dig> also occurred in most genotypes but in very low concentrations from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mg.g- <dig>  cy-gal and cy-glu generally occurred in the same genotypes, but the concentrations of cy-glu were significantly lower than those of cy-gal . genotypes were recorded as having from one anthocyanin present, either cy-xylgal or cy-gal, to having up to all eight anthocyanins present. among the chromatograms recorded, four patterns of anthocyanin concentration were found . in figure  <dig> – traces  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively, the anthocyanins identified in greatest concentration were 1: cy-gal and cy-glu; 2: cy-xylgal and cy-glu; and 3: cy-gal and dp-gal. in the fourth pattern multiple anthocyanins were present, with cy-xylgal and cy-gal dominating the anthocyanin profiles.

four flavonols were assayed as potential co-pigments. quercetin-rutinoside , quercetin-glucoside  and kaemferol-glucoside  were present in all genotypes. concentrations ranged from  <dig>  mg.g- <dig> to  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   mg.g- <dig> of petal tissue. kaemferol-rutinoside  was present in  <dig> of the  <dig> genotypes, and at much lower concentrations between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mg.g- <dig>  there was no apparent association between the concentration of flavonol present and the perceived hue of the petals.

identification of candidate anthocyanin regulatory factors
previous research has shown the key role of the myb/bhlh/wdr complex in regulation of the flavonoid pathway, and, in particular a subgroup of r2r3-myb characterized by the presence of the bhlh interacting signature  in the r2r <dig> domain, and a c-terminus kprprf motif typical of anthocyanin regulators  <cit> . from an extensive est database from different species and tissues of actinidia <cit> , two r2r3-mybs were identified, myb <dig> and myb110a, with both these motifs  <cit> . further sequencing of kiwifruit genomic sequences led to the identification of a third r2r3-myb , almost identical in the coding sequence region to myb110a, but which proved, through expression studies, to be a different gene and not an allelic variation of myb110a, and assigned to a different locus by genetic mapping.

in a phylogenetic tree based on the alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences, the three myb genes: myb <dig>  myb110a, myb110b, were grouped with the other r2r3-myb genes shown to be involved in the anthocyanin regulatory process in several plant species .

gel and capillary array electrophoresis of two myb <dig> candidate genes in families segregating for petal colour
the sequence of each of the myb <dig> genes in this study was examined and pcr primer pairs were designed to create microsatellite markers that would identify each gene. myb110a was represented by marker ke <dig> and myb110b by marker ke <dig>  the pcr products amplified by the markers of both the myb <dig> candidate genes were examined by gel electrophoresis with a sample set of both red and white-petalled progeny from the interspecific backcross. both markers were seen to be polymorphic, with particular bands segregating with red petal colour.

a single band for myb110a was amplified in white petal types using ke <dig> primers, while a second band clearly amplified in all red petal samples . capillary array electrophoresis with these primers revealed products of two sizes amplified in the available parents of the crosses made to produce the f <dig> backcross families . the red-petalled a. eriantha or a. eriantha x a. chinensis var. chinensis parents were found to carry alleles corresponding to pcr products of sizes  <dig> bases , and  <dig> bases , and the presence of allele  <dig> conferred the red phenotype for petal colour. the male parent, a. chinensis ck15_ <dig>  of the f <dig> population was homozygous and carried allele  <dig>  this simple allelic pattern in the parents gave rise to red-petalled progeny with alleles  <dig> and  <dig>  and white-petalled progeny that were homozygous for allele  <dig> 

analysis by capillary electrophoresis of pcr products with the myb <dig> gene markers showed that both myb110a and myb110b carried alleles that segregated with red petal colour. in all the parents available for analysis, and progeny, only two alleles were amplified with myb110a marker primers. red-petalled actinidia genotypes carried alleles represented by pcr products sized  <dig>  and  <dig> , while white-petalled genotypes were homozygous for allele  <dig>  analysis with myb110b showed a total of ten alleles amplified in parents. of these ten alleles, only six were found in the f <dig> backcross progeny. two of the six alleles, alleles  <dig> and  <dig>  segregated with red petal colour. the presence of either allele gave the red phenotype.

gel electrophoresis with the primer pair representing myb110b demonstrated that white petal genotypes gave a single band while two bands, with a third minor band, were present in all red petal samples . with capillary array electrophoresis, a total of ten alleles produced amplification products in the available parents of the families . of the ten alleles shown in parental genotypes, only six were recorded in the progeny of the four families. of these six alleles, two were found to segregate with red colour, alleles  <dig> and  <dig> . family  <dig> carried allele  <dig> while families  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> all carried allele  <dig> 

mapping of myb110a , myb110b  and myb <dig> 
three sets of primers were used to amplify markers within myb <dig>  myb110a and myb110b gene regions. marker ke <dig>  designed for the myb <dig> gene, amplified a female informative marker  in a diploid a. chinensis var. chinensis mapping population . inclusion of this marker into a dataset of microsatellite markers from this population, and using joinmap  <dig>  to group and order markers, linked the gene to linkage group  <dig>  marker ke <dig>  designed for the myb110b gene, amplified a fully informative marker b x cd) in the diploid a. chinensis var. chinensis mapping population and genetic mapping linked this gene to linkage group  <dig>  marker ke <dig>  designed for the myb110a gene, amplified a non-polymorphic marker  in the diploid a. chinensis mapping family, so the position of this gene within the genome was unable to be determined by genetic mapping in a. chinensis. however, in the  x a. chinensis var. chinensis hybrids, marker ke <dig> was fully informative and ke <dig> was female informative and the two markers were tightly linked together and also tightly linked with the red petal phenotype .

myb110a expression correlates with anthocyanin synthesis in flower petals
cyanidin 3-o-galactoside is an abundant anthocyanin in red petals and is required for the formation of cyanidin 3-o-xylogalactose . f3gt <dig> is an anthocyanin 3-o-galactosyltransferase previously described in fruit of a. chinensis that glycosylates cyanidin 3-o-galactoside in vitro <cit> . by quantitative pcr  we analysed the level of transcript of f3gt <dig> in four different genotypes, of which two  had white petals, and two  had bright red petals, at two different stages of flower development: calyx split and full bloom.

transcript levels of f3gt <dig> were high in 21-08-12d and 21-05-10h during flower development, but barely detectable in 21-05-08a and 21-05-11f . this result correlates with the degree of pigmentation of the petals. in the genotypes with red petals, the level of transcript of f3gt <dig> was higher at the calyx split stage of development and decreased as the flower developed to full bloom. in the white flowered genotypes, the level of transcript was barely detectable at either stage tested. transcript levels of both myb110a and myb <dig> were higher at the early stage of calyx split in the two red petal genotypes, and both were seen to decline at the later stage of full bloom . myb110a showed a high level of transcript in the red petals, while myb <dig> was expressed, but at a much lower level. cdna sequence analysis of the expressed transcript confirmed the identification as myb110a. primers specific for myb110b did not amplify any transcript, indicating that myb110b is not expressed in petals.

in the white petals the level of myb110a transcript was barely detectable at any stage. myb110a expression appeared to be strongly correlated with f3gt <dig> expression, being present in the same tissue and showing the same pattern of expression. both were highly expressed at calyx split, with expression declining at full bloom. this strong link between the transcript level of myb110a and f3gt <dig> suggests the involvement of myb110a in the regulation of the transcription of f3gt <dig>  and of the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway in the petals of a. eriantha, and of the studied population.

myb110a regulates f3gt <dig> expression and anthocyanin biosynthesis
to assess the ability of myb110a to regulate gene expression of the anthocyanin pathway in actinidia flower petals, it was determined if myb110a was able to trans-activate the actinidia f3gt <dig> promoter in a transient luciferase assay performed in nicotiana benthamiana leaves. the luciferase assay showed that the f3gt <dig> promoter was strongly activated by myb110a . co-transformation of myb110a with the arabidopsis bhlh tt <dig> slightly increased luciferase activity. a similar result was obtained when the arabidopsis r2r3myb atmyb <dig>  was used, while no activation occurred when the bhlh attt <dig> alone was tested . when an arabidopsis promoter atdfr <cit> , fused to luciferase was used, myb110a showed strong activation with and without attt <dig>  while atmyb <dig> was significantly stimulated by the presence of attt <dig>  this suggests that myb110a was either able to recruit endogenous tobacco bhlh and wdr and form the mbw complex to induce promoter activation, or other co-factors are involved.

myb110a was transiently over-expressed in the petals of a white-petalled individual  of the f <dig> backcross population. agrobacterium strain gv <dig>  carrying a plasmid  harbouring 35s::myb110a, was syringed into a small cut in the petal edge. in the area surrounding the site of infiltration, over-expression of myb110a complemented the white phenotype and restored the ability to synthesise anthocyanin in petals . microscopy of a petal demonstrating transient expression  showed that anthocyanin pigmentation varied in concentration within the pigmented area  and was confined within individual cells . transient over-expression of green fluorescent protein  in petals showed that agrobacterium alone does not elicit an anthocyanin response in white petals . the luciferase assay and the complementation of white petal phenotype by over-expression of myb110a demonstrate the ability of this transcription factor to activate and regulate the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway in petals of the actinidia hybrid population.

discussion
previous studies have concentrated on the characterization of red colour in the fruit of actinidia species  <cit> . in those studies three cyanidin-based and two delphinidin-based anthocyanins were identified in fruit of six actinidia species. while the cyanidin compounds were found in all the species examined, only two taxa, a. melanandra and a. arguta var. purpurea, contained the delphinidin-based compounds: delphinidin 3-o-galactoside and delphinidin 3-o-galactoside. they were not found in either a. chinensis or a. eriantha. in our study we found that both delphinidin compounds were present in the petals in a proportion of the progeny genotypes within three of the four families resulting from a backcross between a. eriantha and a. chinensis var. chinensis. cyanidin and delphinidin are produced through different branches of the anthocyanin pathways, from the action of either the flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase  or flavonoid 3'5'-hydroxylase , so our results suggest that both pathways are activated in the flowers of the actinidia backcross population studied here  <cit> .

anthocyanin colour perception in plant tissues is affected by the ability of the anthocyanins to undergo changes in chemical form resulting from their interactions with metal ions, other anthocyanin molecules , or other unrelated compounds . these associations may cause a change in hue, or an increase in colour intensity  <cit> . a wide range of potential co-pigment compounds have been reported, but by far the most common are the colourless flavonol and flavone types of flavonoids. flavonols were found in the petal samples examined here, with three of the four flavonols identified, quercetin-rutinoside, quercetin-glucoside and kaempferol-glucoside, being present in all samples. while kaempferol-rutinoside was present in  <dig> of the  <dig> samples, it was only found in small concentrations, and its presence or absence did not correlate with the perceived hue of the petals. neither was the presence or absence of delphinidin compounds aligned with perceived hue. this can be seen from the two genotypes 21-07-11a and 21-09-13d, where delphinidin was not present in either genotype but petals of 21-09-13d appeared to have a blue tinge . therefore we conclude that the hue variation observed in the different genotypes cannot be explained by the combinations of anthocyanin or flavonol types recorded. the differences in depth of colour seen in the petals corresponded to the total anthocyanin concentration.

this study indicates that anthocyanin and flavonol biosynthesis in actinidia is a complex and highly regulated process. the flavonol kaempferol and the anthocyanin pelargonidin share the same dihydrokaempferol  precursor. however, while kaempferol was present in the petals, the dhk was not apparently utilised by dihydroflavonol 4-reductase  and anthocyanidin synthase  to produce pelargonidin, as this compound was not detected. rather, the biosynthetic route to anthocyanins proceeded by the action of f3'h and f3'5'h on the precursors prior to their conversion by dfr and ans to cyanidin  and delphinidin . the presence of f3'5'h activity, however, did not result in the production of the flavonol myricetin, which also has 3'4'5'-hydroxylation. the apparent channelling of substrate into flavonols and anthocyanins with varying patterns of hydroxylation, despite the presence of the f3'h and f3'5'h, has also been observed in other species  <cit> . it could reflect different developmental timings for the production of flavonols and anthocyanins, metabolic channelling within enzyme complexes, or particular substrate specificity of biosynthetic enzymes such as dfr. the dfr of genera such as petunia and cymbidium have been shown to have only weak activity with dhk, resulting in the near absence of pelargonidin-based anthocyanins in these genera  <cit> .

in general, flavonoids with a free hydroxyl group at the c- <dig> position of the heterocyclic ring are unstable under physiological conditions, and are therefore typically found as their glycosylated forms. unlike the case in many plants, differential glycosylation occurs at the c- <dig> position for flavonols and anthocyanins of actinidia. the flavonols identified were glucosides and rutinosides , while the main anthocyanins were galactosides and xylosyl-galactosides. only low concentrations of anthocyanin-glucosides were found, and anthocyanin-rutinosides were not detected.

three r2r3-myb genes have been identified for actinidia that show the conserved amino acid sequences of activators of anthocyanin biosynthesis – myb <dig>  myb110a and myb110b. myb110a is thought likely to be the major gene defining petal colour as it was expressed at high levels in red but not white petals, and myb110b expression was not detected at all. expression for myb110a  was highest before full bloom, and declined as the flower expanded. this pattern occurs with anthocyanin-related mybs controlling other floral phenotypes, eg. petunia  <cit> . the white-petalled phenotype of flowers was complemented through introduction of myb110a, confirming its identity as an anthocyanin regulator. furthermore, specific gene markers were obtained that linked different alleles of myb110a to the presence of white versus red petals. the results show that myb110a is the agent of specificity of anthocyanin expression in the flower petals while myb110b is probably a tightly linked, but not expressed, relative of myb110a. fruit flesh and flower ovary and filament colour must be under the control of other r2r3-myb gene family members, or alleles, as these did not segregate with myb110a. future work will concentrate on identifying fruit-specific r2r3-myb markers for use in marker assisted breeding.

in transient assays, adding exogenous bhlh  had surprisingly little effect on the activation of the f3gt <dig> and atdfr promoters by myb110a. however, it is unlikely that myb110a functions without a bhlh. instead myb110a may be more efficient at interacting with tobacco bhlhs already present in the transiently expressing cell, and this could be determined using hairpins to tobacco endogenous bhlh genes. although the bhlh is thought to be the main component that links with the different wdr, r2r3- and r3-myb proteins in the mbw regulatory complex, variation in bhlh expression is unlikely to provide for tissue-specific anthocyanin production. the results in our study of actinidia support the proposal that variation in r2r3-myb activator function and expression is the key determinant of spatial and temporal patterning of anthocyanin production in most plant species  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that the red petal phenotype in the interspecific actinidia population is the result of a mixture of anthocyanins, with cy-gal present in the greatest concentration, and with cy-xylgal and cy-glu also present in significant amounts, and in various combinations, in individual genotypes. other anthocyanins were present in minor quantities in different genotypes. delphinidin was recorded as both delphinidin 3-o-galactoside  and delphinidin 3-o-galactoside  and could be considered in parent choice for breeding populations for colour variation in fruit. red or white petal colour in a. chinensis x a. eriantha hybrids is determined by myb110a.
