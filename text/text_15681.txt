BACKGROUND
in mammals, the neural structure responsible for most circadian behaviours can be localized to a bilaterally paired structure in the hypothalamus, the suprachiasmatic nucleus . these scn neurons must be synchronized to each other as well as to the environment in order to function adaptively. the daily cycle of light and dark is the dominant environmental cue responsible for synchronizing this biological timing system to the environment. the scn receives photic information directly through a monosynaptic projection from the retina known as the retinal hypothalamic tract . the rht comprises a distinct subset of retinal ganglion cells that contain a novel photopigment melanopsin and are directly light-sensitive  <cit> . there is a variety of evidence that the amino acid glutamate is a transmitter at the rht/scn synaptic connection and that this transmitter plays a critical role in mediating photic regulation of the circadian system  <cit> . one of the main post -synaptic consequences of glutamate receptor activation within the scn is an increase in intracellular calcium   <cit> . the signal transduction events after ca2+ release are beginning to be understood and include the release of nitric oxide, activation of the ras/map kinase cascade, and ultimately changes in gene expression  <cit> .

the neuropeptide pacap has emerged as a likely retinal messenger to the scn, acting in concert with glutamate to communicate with the scn. pacap-like immunoreactivity is found in terminals of retinal ganglion neurons innervating the scn  <cit>  and two of the receptors sensitive to pacap  are expressed in the scn  <cit> . in the scn, application of pacap results in ca2+ transients  <cit> , activation of the mapk signalling cascade  <cit> , and changes in gene expression  <cit> . at a systems level, applica tion of pacap can shift the phase  <cit>  or alter the magnitude of glutamate -induced phase shifts  <cit>  of the circadian rhythm of scn neuronal firing in a brain slice preparation. similarly, microinjections of pacap into the scn region in vivo can cause phase shifts  <cit> . administration of a pacap receptor antagonist or an antibody against pacap attenuates light-induced phase delays  <cit> . the circadian system of mice deficient in the pac <dig> receptor  <cit> , the vpac <dig> receptor  <cit> , or pacap  <cit> , each exhibited altered behavioural responses to light. in our own work, we have found that pacap-deficient mice exhibit a selective loss in the magnitude of light-induced phase advances and delays  <cit> . given this previous data, we became interested in understanding more about pacap/glutamate interactions at the cellular level in the night.

RESULTS
pacap enhanced excitatory synaptic transmission measured in mouse scn neurons
pacap is co-expressed with glutamate in at least some of the retinal ganglion cell population that innervates the scn  <cit> . whole -cell voltage -clamp recording techniques were used to test the hypothesis that pacap may function to modulate spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents  in ventral scn neurons during the night . the mean frequency and the mean amplitude of sepscs recorded at a holding potential of - <dig> mv were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  hz and - <dig>  ±  <dig>  pa, respectively . these sepscs were recorded in the presence of ttx and bicuculline. the sepscs were completely abolished with cnqx , indicating that they are largely mediated by ampa/ka glurs. application of pacap  increased the sepsc amplitude by 20% ± 5%  in all ventral scn neurons examined. pacap also increased the sepsc frequency in  <dig> of  <dig> cells . thus pacap can increase both sepsc frequency and amplitude, suggesting that pacap can modulate both pre-synaptic release as well as post-synaptic sensitivity to glutamate.

pacap enhanced ampa-evoked currents recorded in mouse scn neurons
to directly test the hypothesis that pacap modulates the post-synaptic response of scn neurons to glutamatergic stimulation, whole cell patch clamp recording techniques were used to directly measure currents evoked by ampa  in ventral scn neurons . most scn neurons  exhibited ampa-evoked currents. these inward currents exhibited a linear voltage-dependency with reversal potentials around  <dig> mv. ampa-evoked currents were stable  over the course of  <dig> min of recording  and were eliminated by the addition of the ampa/ka glur antagonist cnqx . these experiments were performed in the presence of tea , ttx  and cd2+  to block most voltage dependent ionic currents. the bath application of ampa  produced a normalized peak current of - <dig>  ±  <dig>  pa/pf  in ventral scn neurons recorded in the night . pre-treatment with pacap  significantly enhanced the magnitude of ampa-evoked currents in scn neurons examined . pre-treatment with a higher concentration of pacap  did not result in a greater enhancement of the magnitude of ampa -evoked currents in scn neurons examined . lower concentrations of pacap did not produce significant changes in the magnitude of the ampa response . by itself, pacap did not evoke any measurable current in scn neurons held at a range of different voltages .

in the next set of experiments, we wanted to determine if this e ffect of pacap is mediated by pac <dig> receptors and a regulation of the adenylyl cyclase  signalling cascade . the pac <dig> receptor agonist maxadilan  enhanced the peak current evoked by ampa  whereas pretreatment with the pac <dig> antagonist m <dig> prevented the stimulatory effect of pacap  on ampa currents . pac <dig> receptors are positively coupled to ac activity and additional experiments were designed to investigate if pacap enhancement of ampa currents could be mediated through this mechanism. the application of an ac activator, forskolin  increased the magnitude of the ampa currents . by itself, application of the pka inhibitor, h <dig> , alone did not significantly alter the magnitude of the ampa currents ; however, in the presence of h <dig>  pacap no longer produced a significant change in the magnitude of the ampa current . this data was all collected in ventral scn neurons recorded in the night . this data suggests that pacap can modulate ampa currents through a pac <dig> receptor mediated activation of the ac/pka signalling pathway.

pacap enhanced nmda-evoked currents recorded in mouse scn neurons
pacap can potentiate nmda currents in acutely disassociated hamster scn neurons  <cit>  and we sought to determine if pacap has the same effect in ventral scn neurons in mice . whole cell patch clamp recording techniques were used to directly measure currents evoked by nmda  in ventral scn neurons recorded during the night . these experiments were performed in the presence of tea , ttx  and cd2+  in the bath. most scn neurons  exhibited nmda-evoked currents . these inward currents were voltage-dependent, i.e. nmda-evoked currents peaked when the cell was held at a membrane potential between - <dig> and - <dig> mv. nmda-evoked currents were stable  over the course of  <dig> min of recording  and were reduced 85% by the addition of the nmda antagonist ap <dig> . the bath application of nmda  produced a normalized peak current of - <dig>  ±  <dig>  pa/pf  in ventral scn neurons recorded in the night. treatment with pacap  also significantly enhanced the magnitude of nmda-evoked currents in scn neurons examined . the application of fsk  also increased the magnitude of the nmda currents . in the presence of h <dig>  pacap no longer produced a significant change in the magnitude of the nmda current .

pacap enhanced ampa and nmda evoked ca2+ transients in mouse scn neurons
one of the main postsynaptic consequences of glutamatergic stimulation of neurons in the scn is the induction of a ca2+ transient  <cit> . previous studies have demonstrated that pacap alone can increase ca2+ as well as modulate glutamatergic evoked responses in cultured rat scn neurons  <cit> . in order to test the hypothesis that pacap regulates ampa – and nmda-induced ca2+ transients in ventral scn neurons during the night , a bulk loading procedure was used to load cells with a membrane permeable form of the ca2+ indicator dye fura <dig>  cells that exhibited uneven loading due to dye sequestration were not included in the data set. small cell types including glia were easily identified and were also excluded in the data set. these experiments were carried out in the presence of ttx. by itself, pacap  produced an average increase in ca2+ of 6% ± 1%  whereas a lower concentration of pacap  produced an average increase in ca2+ of 2% ± 1% . lower concentrations of pacap  did not alter ca2+ levels within scn neurons . while most cells  in the ventral scn region did not respond to pacap, there was a subpopulation of cells that exhibited a robust ca2+ response to the bath application of pacap. in this subpopulation within the ventral scn , pacap  caused mean peak changes in ca2+ of 19% ± 1%. in addition, pacap pre-treatment significantly enhanced scn cells' response to ampa . within the ventral scn , bath application of ampa  alone increased ca2+ levels by 26% ± 2% whereas the same treatment increased ca2+ levels by 34% ± 4% after pre-treatment with pacap . the effects of pacap on ampa were mimicked by the pac <dig> agonist maxadilan  . finally, pacap pre-treatment significantly enhanced scn cells' response to nmda . within the ventral scn , bath application of nmd a  alone increased ca2+ levels by 15% ± 1% whereas the same treatment increased ca2+ levels by 31% ± 3% after treatment with pacap .

pacap enhanced ampa currents and ampa-evoked ca2+ transients in rat scn neurons
previous studies in cultured rat scn neurons have demonstrated that pacap alone can increase ca2+ as well as modulate glutamatergic evoked responses  <cit> . in the final set of experiments, we sought to determine if the pacap regulation of ampa currents and ca2+ transients that we described in mice were also present in the rat preparation . the experimental conditions for experiments with the rat were the same as described for the mouse above with the data collected from ventral scn neurons during the night . the bath application of ampa  produced a normalized peak current of - <dig>  ±  <dig>   <dig> pa/pf . treatment with pacap  significantly enhanced the magnitude of ampa -evoked currents in these cells . application of pacap alone  produced measurable ca2+ transients in most scn neurons  with an average increase in ca2+ of 85% ± 35%. finally, pre-treatment with pacap significantly enhanced ampa-evoked ca2+ transients within the rat scn. bath application of ampa  alone increased ca2+ levels by 28% ± 6% whereas the same treatment increased ca2+ levels by 43% ± 8% after treatment with pacap . therefore, while pacap enhanced ampa evoked currents and ca2+ transients in both species, the magnitude of pacap's actions were greater in the rat.

discussion
the neuropeptide pacap has emerged as a likely retinal messenger to the scn acting in concert with glutamate to communicate with the scn. understanding the cellular mecha nisms by which pacap regulates scn neurons is a critical step toward the development of a mechanistic explanation for the role of this peptide in the mammalian circadian system. the data reported here demonstrate that pacap is a potent modulator of glutamatergic signalling within the scn during the night. first, we found that pacap increases the sepsc frequency recorded in scn in the presence of ttx. each miniature synaptic current is thought to result from the spontaneous fusion of an individual synaptic vesicle with the pre-synaptic membrane subsequently resulting in quantal release of transmitter molecules. changes in the frequency at which this process occurs are normally associated with alterations in the pre -synaptic release process while changes in the amplitude of the currents reflect postsynaptic changes in receptor sensitivity or ionic driving force. the finding that pacap changed the sepsc frequency indicates a pre-synaptic mechanism. interestingly, the pac <dig> receptor mrna and protein are expressed in retinal ganglion cells  <cit>  and may thus be in the neurons that form the rht. at least one previous study found evidence to suggest that pacap can act presynaptically to increase the frequency of excitatory postsynaptic potentials in the hippocampus  <cit> . in addition to the enhanced presynaptic release of glutamate, the observation that pacap can directly increase the amplitude of sepscs is consistent with post-synaptic regulation.

we then directly demonstrated that application of pacap enhances the magnitude of the currents evoked by application of ampa and nmda. this later data complements a previous study by harrington and colleagues  <cit>  demonstrating that pacap can enhance nmda currents in acutely disassociated hamster scn neurons. we assume that glutamate receptor mediated ca2+ transients are likely to be critically involved in the regulation of transcriptional events needed to generate phase shifts of circadian rhythms. therefore, we examined the effect of pacap on ca2+ levels in scn neurons. pacap elicits marked ca2+ transients in about 30% of the ventral scn cells that we examined. this effect was quite modest in the mouse and not statistically significant but was much more robust in the rat. pacap-mediated increases in cytosolic ca2+ have been observed previously in cultured rat scn neurons and have been found due to the release of ca2+ from intracellular stores  <cit> . pacap also enhanced the magnitude of the ca2+ transient evoked by stimulation with ampa and nmda. pacap potentiation of ampa-evoked ca2+ transients has previously been demonstrated from cultured rat scn neurons  <cit> .

pacap is a member of the glucagon/vasoactive intestinal peptide/secretin/growth hormone -releasing family of structurally related peptides  <cit> . the neuromodulatory actions of pacap are mediated by three receptor subtypes: pac <dig>  vpac <dig>  and vpac <dig>  <cit> . the pac <dig> receptor is more selective for pacap while the vpac <dig> and vpac <dig> receptors can be potently activated by vip or pacap  <cit> . both pac <dig> and vpac <dig> mrnas are expressed within the rat scn  <cit> . in the present study, we found that the pac <dig> receptor agonist maxadilan  <cit>  mimicked the effects of pacap on ampa-evoked currents and ca2+ transients whereas pretreatment with the pac <dig> antagonist m <dig>  <cit>  prevented the stimulatory effect of pacap. as is the case with many receptor agonists, maxadilan produced a stronger effect then equal molar concentrations of pacap itself  <cit> .

application of maxadilan alone has been previously shown to evoke changes in the firing rate of 40% of scn neurons examined and activations to this agonist were not altered by a vpac <dig> antagonist   <cit> . a recent study found that pac <dig> mrna was present in nearly half  of the vip expressing neurons in the rat scn  <cit> . this frequency of receptor expression fits reasonably well with our ca2+ imaging measurements in the ventral scn in which about half the scn cells sampled exhibited a pacap enhancement of ampa evoked responses. similarly, previous physiological studies are also consistent with the pac <dig> receptor mediating many of the effects of pacap in the scn  <cit> . thus, the available evidence indicates that the pac <dig> receptor is responsible for mediating the effects of pacap on scn neurons.

the pac <dig> receptor has several possible splice variants that allow the receptor to couple to different second messenger signalling cascades  <cit> . a pcr analys is of the mrna isolated from the rat scn found evidence for the expression of two pac <dig> isoforms including the pac1null splice variant  <cit> . this form of the receptor can potently activate ac through gs in transfected cells  <cit> . nmda and ampa receptors are known to be subject to a wide range of regulatory/modulatory influences including serine/threonine kinases  <cit> . therefore, we examined the hypothesis that pacap regulates ampa receptors through an activation of the ac/pka signalling cascade. we found that the application of an ac activator  mimicked the enhancement of ampa currents produced by pacap. pretreatment with a pka inhibitor  prevented the enhancement of ampa currents by pacap but, by itself, h <dig> did not alter these currents. the simplest explanation for our data is that pacap modulate glutamatergic signalling through a pac <dig> receptor mediated activation of ac activity. however, less direct effects are also possible. for example, pacap increases expression of scaffolding proteins homer <dig> and rack <dig> and both of these proteins have been shown to play a role in the regulation of glutamateric synaptic transmission  <cit> . furthermore, previous work by dziema and obrietan  <cit>  suggests that pacap enhances ampa-evoked ca2+ transients through a regulation of l -type ca2+ currents mediated by mapk signal transduction cascade. in contrast, we still saw pacap-enhancement of ampa currents even when voltage-gated ca2+ currents were blocked by cadmium. thus pacap appears to utilize a variety of mechanisms by which it can regulate the excitability of scn neurons including pre-synaptic regulation of glutamate release, as well as the post-synaptic regulation of glurs, activation of voltage-sensitive ca2+ channels  <cit>  and release of ca2+ from intracellular stores  <cit> .

in the present study, we examined the concentration dependence of pacap evoked changes in ca2+ transients and pacap enhancement of ampa currents. we did not find significant measurable changes at the  <dig>  and  <dig>  nm pacap concentrations. we focused on the nanomolar concentration range as we wanted to use the lowest possible concentrations that produced physiological effects. previous studies have found physiological effects of pacap on scn neurons in the nanomolar concentration range  <cit> . we did not explore the micomolar concentrations though pacap at these concentrations has been shown to alter glutamate induced regulation of mper and phase shifts of neural activity rhythms  <cit> .

there is also evidence that pacap actions on the circadian system can vary with the phase of the daily cycle. when measur ing neural activity rhythms from rat brain slices, administration of pacap in micromolar concentrations enhanced the phase shifting effects of glutamate in the early night but had the opposite effect in the late night  <cit> . furthermore, the administration of anti-pacap antibodies into the cerebral ventricles of hamsters was reported to enhance light-induced phase advances  <cit>  and attenuate light-induced phase delays  <cit> . light stimulation in the early night resulted in larger phase delays in pac <dig> -/- mice accompanied by a reduction in light-induced mper and c-fos expression  <cit> . in the late night, photic stimulation of the pac <dig> -/- mice produced phase delays instead of the usual phase advances and was not associated with any changes in mper or fos. these studies have led to the proposal that pacap's effects on the light-input to the circadian system are phase-dependent in that pacap will enhance light-induced phase delays but inhibit light-induced phase advances  <cit> . in contrast, a recent study found that pacap-deficient mice exhibited significantly attenuated phase advances but light-induced phase delays were only slightly diminished  <cit> . in our own work, we found pacap -deficient mice exhibited significant impairment in the magnitude of the response to brief light exposures with both light-induced phase delays and advances of the circadian system impacted  <cit> . the present physiological data indicate that pacap enhances ampa and nmda currents in the early night. thus our data lead us to propose that pacap plays a role modulating the response of scn neurons to glutamatergic stimulation and is required for normal light-induced synchronization of the circadian system.

CONCLUSIONS
in our view, pacap acts through multiple mechanisms to enhance glutamatergic input to the scn and that loss of this modulation results in a loss of sensitivity to photic stimulation during the night. first, our finding that pacap increases sepsc frequency and the anatomical finding that pac <dig> receptors are expressed in retinal ganglion cells  <cit>  raises the possibility that pacap may act presynaptically to regulate the release of glutamate onto scn neurons. in addition, pacap enhances both nmda-evoked and ampa-evoked currents in scn neurons. our evidence suggests that pacap regulation of the magnitude of ampa currents is dependent upon pac <dig> receptors and the adenylyl cyclase-signalling cascade. interestingly, a recent study found evidence suggesting that the enhancement of ampa mediated synaptic transmission in the scn is sufficient to increase the magnitude of light-induced phase delays  <cit> . finally, pacap can increase ca2+ by itself as well as enhance ampa- and glutamate -evoked increases in ca2+  <cit> . l ikely through these mechanisms, pacap can regulate mper expression in scn neurons  <cit> . certainly, a better understanding of the cellular mechanisms by which pacap regulates scn neurons is a critical step toward the development of a mechanistic explanation for the role of this peptide in the circadian system.
