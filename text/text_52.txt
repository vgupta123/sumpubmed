BACKGROUND
one of the key challenges in systems biology is to develop a complete computational model of biology that can be used for both integration of knowledge and to develop and test hypotheses. a number of computational tools had been developed  over the years, such as cobra toolkit
 <cit> . however, medema et al.
 <cit>  did not mention about any tools for transcriptome prediction. selinger et al.
 <cit>  proposed that a means to predict gene expressions will be useful for predicting the effects of gene over-expression, knockouts, and environmental stimuli.

a number of recent studies had attempted to predict gene expression using in silico methods. chikina et al.
 <cit>  used microarray data to predict tissue-specific gene expression in various tissues of caenorhabditis elegans. ouyang et al.
 <cit>  used transcription factors binding data from chip-seq experiments to predict gene expression in mouse embryonic cells. mcleay et al.
 <cit>  expanded on ouyang et al.
 <cit>  by modeling the binding efficiency of transcription factors to promoters; thereby, using it to predict gene expressions. mcleay et al.
 <cit>  reported correlation of  <dig>  when tested on gm <dig> cells but histones modification and chromatin accessibility data needs to be incorporated, which may limit its application due to the lack of required data. fox and erill
 <cit>  used relative codon usage bias to predict the expression levels of e. coli genes of more than 1000 bp, achieving a correlation of  <dig>  between predicted and actual expression. this is higher than the correlation of  <dig>  reported by roymondal et al.
 <cit>  when correlating relative codon usage bias to the expression levels of e. coli genes of all lengths. a further study by the same group attempted to predict the expression of synechocystis pcc  <dig>  using relative codon usage bias reported a correlation between  <dig>  and  <dig> 
 <cit> . however, there had been no study demonstrating the use of gene co-expression network  in gene expression prediction in e. coli.

gcn had been commonly used to study expressional similarities of genes
 <cit> , where the nodes are the genes and a link  between  <dig> nodes when the gene-pair is co-expressed. the basis of gcn is that expressionally correlated genes are likely to be functionally related
 <cit>  or evolutionarily conserved
 <cit> . gcn had been successfully used in several cases, such as identifying developmental processes
 <cit> , annotating functional genes
 <cit> , and studying disease progression
 <cit> . although there had been a number of methods proposed to estimate the degree of co-expression
 <cit> ; such as using rank correlation
 <cit> , weights
 <cit>  and mixed-models
 <cit> ; pearson’s correlation is commonly used
 <cit>  due to presence of upper and lower boundaries of correlation coefficient, resulting in ease of interpretation
 <cit> . once the co-expression between two genes is established, the expression level of a gene can be predicted from the known expression of another gene by means of linear regression
 <cit> . this suggests that gcn has the advantage of estimating a large number of gene expressions from a small number of known gene expressions.

in this study, we developed a predictor to predict transcriptome-scale gene expression from a small number of known gene expressions using gcn, which may be used to predict the effects of over-expressions and knockdowns on e. coli transcriptome. the correlation of  <dig> genes that are detected by  <dig> probes on the microarray is  <dig> . using microarray data not used in gcn building, our transcriptome prediction results show that the correlation between expected and predicted expressions using expression values is  <dig> . our perturbation prediction results show that the correlation between predicted and actual expression values among perturbation-affected genes to be  <dig> . using our ability to predict the effects of gene perturbations, we presented a case study to estimate the effects of varying gene expression level of hydrogenase  <dig> maturation endopeptidase ; thereby, identifying a range of expression levels in which there is no effect on the native transcriptome and we termed this range as expressional buffer. hence, this study presents a potential means to estimate transcriptome-scale gene expressions which has the potential to predict the effects of gene over-expression, knockouts, and environmental stimuli
 <cit> .

RESULTS
we developed a predictor based on gcn to predict transcriptome-scale gene expression and estimate the effects of changing the expression of genes, such as over-expression and under-expression, on a native transcriptome.

fifty-nine source genes reach  <dig> genes
a total of  <dig> , <dig> permuted probe-pairs were generated from  <dig>  non-control probes in gpl <dig>  these non-control probes were mapped to  <dig>  genes. thus, only  <dig> genes were represented by  <dig> probes . for simplicity, we shall use "genes" to represent both "genes" and "probes" hereafter. the average correlation of these gene-pairs is  <dig> , which is similar to that reported in other studies
 <cit> . using the correlation threshold suggested by reverter et al.
 <cit>  of absolute correlation coefficient that is higher than  <dig>  , only  <dig>   pairs and  <dig>   genes remained and were used to construct the co-expression network.

using the  <dig> genes that were represented by  <dig> probes on the microarray, intra-array variation
 <cit>  can be estimated by analyzing the differences from these  <dig> probes
 <cit> . theoretically, their expression values will be the same and the ratio of expression values will be  <dig>  which can be translated to perfect correlation, as they are measuring the same transcript. using all  <dig> microarrays, our results suggest that the average correlation is  <dig>  with a standard error of  <dig> .this is similar to the correlation of  <dig>   reported by ling et al.
 <cit>  on microarray technical replicates of identical biological samples. the average deviation [
∑i=1n|averageratio-1|/n] from a perfect ratio of  <dig> is  <dig> %, suggesting that the average intra-array variation can be estimated to be  <dig> % . our estimate falls within 11% and 33% intra-array variation estimated by anderson et al.
 <cit>  whom proposed a novel array microenvironment normalization  to reduce 72% of the intra-array variation. however, gyorffy et al.
 <cit>  demonstrated that results from rma  normalization correlates well with both tissue samples and cell lines even though other normalization schemes appears to work better with tissue samples or cell lines independently. in addition, amn has not been shown to correlate well with quantitative pcr results. hence, considering that rma normalization correlates well with both tissue samples and cell lines, we chose to continue with rma normalized data. nevertheless, our estimated intra-array variation of  <dig> % suggests potential area of future studies in normalization techniques aiming at reducing such variation as intra-array variation represents noise in the source data which may affect downstream analyses
 <cit> .

after gcn construction, the next step was to determine a small set of genes with the maximum network coverage and minimum degree of separation  as network coverage is directly proportional to the extent of predictable transcriptome and the error in prediction is directly proportional to the number of jumps. we analyzed the number of jumps between any given gene-pairs. our results suggest that the density peaks at  <dig> jumps . with reference to figure 
 <dig>  when a pair of genes is linked by a finite number of paths, the expression of one of the pairs  can be predicted if expression of the other gene  is known. as there can be many paths between the source and target genes, there can be many predicted expression values for the target gene as the number of predicted values equals the number of paths. our results show that accuracy at 20% error decreases drastically from path length of  <dig> or more , suggesting that the limits of predictability is  <dig> jumps. although it can be argued that path lengths of  <dig> or  <dig> may yield higher accuracy, the number of source genes will increase as the number of source genes needed is inversely proportional to the path length in order to achieve the same network coverage. in addition, our results also suggest that intra-array variation adversely affect prediction accuracy .

we analyzed the degree of network coverage using  <dig> sets of source probes – a set of  <dig> source genes from coefficient of determination  of more than  <dig>  and a set of  <dig> source genes from absolute pearson’s correlation of more than  <dig> . since coefficient of variation can be used as a measure of prediction accuracy between a pair of source and target probes, strong correlation in the first jump is likely to improve the overall prediction. our results show that the coverage from the set of  <dig> genes is significantly better than that of  <dig> genes . however,  <dig> is a large number of genes to measure experimentally. we analyzed this set of  <dig> genes in order to reduce it into a smaller set of marker genes
 <cit>  which is feasible for experimental work. at  <dig> jumps, a number of these genes reach to the same set of target genes. by removing redundancy, we reduced  <dig> genes to  <dig> genes but the coverage dropped from  <dig> to  <dig> genes. we examined the set of genes not reached by these  <dig> source genes within  <dig> jumps and added  <dig> genes with the highest degree  to increase the number of source genes from  <dig> to  <dig>  with this addition, the coverage increases to  <dig> genes. we argue that adding more source probes at this stage is unlikely to give equivalent increase in coverage. hence, we proceeded with a set of  <dig> source genes .

transcriptome predicted within 40% error using  <dig> source genes
we attempted to predict e. coli transcriptome using the panel of  <dig> source genes. to do so, we implemented a single pass transcriptome predictor where each target gene will be predicted using expression value from one source gene. we evaluated the accuracy of our predictor using a set of  <dig> microarrays from experiments not used in the gcn construction . these sets of microarray data had been published in  <dig> different experimental studies
 <cit> ; thus, representing a set of unbiased data for evaluating the performance of our predictor . in this aspect, we hold the same evaluation principles as abadia et al.
 <cit> , whom used data from various centres worldwide to evaluate the performance of a newly developed protocol.

although these  <dig> microarrays originated from a diverse range of studies, several recent studies
 <cit>  had suggested that published microarray datasets contain value beyond their initial studies. for example, several studies had analyzed published microarray datasets for reference genes
 <cit>  and other biologically significant features
 <cit> . moreover, most of the  <dig> microarrays originated from studies that were representative of the type of experimental studies which we expect our predictor to be useful in. for example, traxler et al.
 <cit>  examined the global effects of amino acid starvation in e. coli mg <dig> and lee et al.
 <cit>  examined the expression of e. coli stress-related proteins in the presence of pollutants. hence, our evaluation also represented  <dig> experimental case studies on the use of our transcriptome predictor.

our results suggest a positive correlation between the average predicted expression values and the actual expression values of each target gene across all  <dig> transcriptomes  =  <dig> , p-value =  <dig> e-13). this is similar to the correlation of  <dig>   reported by fox and erill
 <cit>  using relative codon usage bias to predict the expression levels of e. coli genes of more than 1000 bp and higher than the reported correlation of  <dig>  to  <dig>   in a study using codon usage bias to predict expression of synechocystis pcc  <dig> genes
 <cit> . as our predictor is not restricted to the length of gene that can be predicted as in the case of fox and erill
 <cit> , the correlation of  <dig>  between actual and predicted expression reported by roymondal et al.
 <cit>  is a more accurate comparison to our result as roymondal et al.
 <cit>  use relative codon usage bias to predict the expression levels of all e. coli genes instead of those more than 1000 bp. based on this, our predictor is more accurate  than that reported by roymondal et al.
 <cit> . in addition, this is not significantly different from the correlation of  <dig>  between duplicate probes from the microarray data measuring the same transcript , suggesting that intra-array variation accounts for a substantial portion of transcriptome prediction error.

our results show that  <dig> of the  <dig> transcriptomes  are predicted within 40% error using  <dig> to  <dig> paths between each source and target gene , with the average error of  <dig> % . this is comparable to 33% error  using chromatin states and transcription factor occupancy, which are less readily available than gene expression values, to predict spatial-temporal expression of genes
 <cit> . hence, our predictor can potentially be used as a preliminary in silico hypothesis screening tool, which only requires the expression of a panel of source genes and can be obtained with routine experimental tools such as quantitative pcr, prior to full-scale transcriptome analysis .

many studies use experimental techniques, such as pcr-based techniques, on a small set of genes to validate microarray results. kendall et al.
 <cit>  use quantitative pcr for detailed analysis of microarray findings elucidated by comparing the transcriptomes of wild-type e. coli 86– <dig> strain and luxs mutant vs <dig>  which corresponds to gsm <dig> and gsm <dig> respectively. these  <dig> microarrays have not been used in our gcn construction. hence, we predicted the transcriptomes of e. coli 86– <dig> strain and luxs mutant vs <dig> using source gene expressions from gsm <dig> and gsm <dig> respectively. we compare our prediction results with  <dig> quantitative pcr results of kendall et al.
 <cit> , showing  <dig> of the  <dig> evaluated genes to be differentially expressed. our results suggest  <dig> out of  <dig> matched conclusions with one false positive and false negative each .

although our results show that the predicted gene expressions of  <dig> representative test samples are more accurate than that of roymondal et al.
 <cit> , our results also show that only  <dig> of the  <dig> transcriptomes can be predicted within 40% error and  <dig> out of  <dig> findings using our prediction match quantitative pcr results of kendall et al.
 <cit> . despite using  <dig> representative test samples for our evaluation, our results are based on meta-analysis of published data. using meta-analysis of published experimental data, we have shown the potential of the predictor. however, the protocol will need to be further validated using more condition-specific experiments. at the moment, our study forms a baseline towards this direction.

it is conceivable that using more than one source gene to predict a target gene may improve prediction accuracy. to test this hypothesis, we developed a multi-pass transcriptome predictor that allows for the use of any number of source genes to predict a target gene. network coverage analysis shows that  <dig> source genes can reach a total of  <dig>  genes in  <dig> jumps or each target gene is reached by an average of  <dig>  source probes. this suggests that the computation time for multi-pass transcriptome prediction will be  <dig>  times longer than single pass transcriptome prediction if maximum number of source gene per target gene is used.

ten of the  <dig> transcriptomes used in the evaluation of single pass transcriptome predictor were used to evaluate the multi-pass transcriptome predictor . our results suggest that there is no difference in terms of percentage difference  even though  <dig> of the  <dig> predicted transcriptomes  are significantly less accurate when predicted by multi-pass method. by examining the standard deviations of the predicted values of each target gene , multi-pass method consistently gives higher standard deviation compared to single pass method . this suggests that better prediction by multi-pass method in terms of average standard deviations between expected and predicted expression levels of target genes is an artifact as a result of larger standard deviations for the predicted values of each target gene. correlation between expected and predicted target expression values is significant , which is similar to that previously reported
 <cit>  but lower than that reported by fox and erill
 <cit>  and significantly lower from our single pass prediction . this suggests that multi-pass transcriptome predictor does not give better prediction compared to single pass transcriptome predictor despite requiring significantly more computational time.

83% of perturbation-affected genes predicted within 40% error
an important application of transcriptome prediction model is predicting the effects of gene over-expression, knockouts, and environmental stimuli in silico <cit> . over-expressions and knockdowns or under-expressions are collectively known as perturbations. a recent study
 <cit>  had modeled the protein concentrations leading to g <dig> cell cycle checkpoint and validated their simulations of protein level perturbations with published studies.

our predictor has the potential to estimate the effects of gene perturbation. for example, if genea is over-expressed by  <dig> times, the affected genes will be the set of genes reachable within  <dig> jumps of genea. our predictor uses a microarray sample as a background transcriptome and performs two predictions. the first prediction predicts the expression values of all reachable genes from the genes of interest before perturbation. perturbations are carried out by varying the expression values of the genes of interest before predicting the expression values all reachable genes from the genes of interest after perturbation. both predictions will provide a predicted value  and a standard deviation of the affected probes, which allow for standard hypothesis testing and power analysis to be performed.

for evaluation, we identified a background transcriptome, a test transcriptome, and perturbed one or more genes from the background transcriptome to the value of the test transcriptome. experimentally, if the effects of a  <dig> times over-expression of genea in e. coli were to be studied, the standard experimental protocol will require an over-expression of genea using a vector which regulates the expression of genea under an inducible promoter and compare the transcriptomes of the control sample against the over-expressed sample
 <cit> . in our study, the background and test transcriptomes were selected to represent the control and perturbed samples respectively. three replicates were performed on each of the  <dig> evaluation tests including single, double and quadruple gene perturbations .

our results show that at least  <dig> % of the affected genes in single gene over-expression or knockdown are predicted within 40% error . for double gene over-expression or knockdown, at least  <dig> % of the affected genes are predicted within 40% of error . using single pass prediction, our results show that at least  <dig> % of the genes affected by single gene over-expression with single gene knockdown  and at least  <dig> % of the genes affected by double gene over-expression with double gene knockdown  can be predicted within 40% error. hence, our results suggest that an average of  <dig> %  of perturbation-affected genes can be potentially predicted within 40% error .

comparing single pass versus multi-pass prediction , accuracy between the predicted and actual expression values of the affected genes dropped when multi-pass prediction was used. statistical comparison between single and multi-pass method shows that this difference is significant . this is consistent with the findings in our initial multi-pass predictor evaluation. the average correlation between the expression values of affected genes predicted by single-pass method after perturbation is  <dig>  with a standard deviation of  <dig>  , which is significant . this result is comparable to the correlation of  <dig>   reported by mcleay et al.
 <cit> , using chip-seq, histones and dnase scores to predict gene expression in mammalian cells. this suggests expression values of genes affected by perturbations can be potentially predicted with accuracy comparative to next generation sequencing methods and sequence analyses. this suggests that our predictor may be a useful in silico tool to examine gene perturbations.

hence, our evaluation also presents itself as a case study of how this predictor can be used. for example, the second replicate of single gene knockdown evaluation corresponds to 56% knockdown of hydrogenase  <dig> maturation endopeptidase , involving in the maturation of hydrogenase  <dig>  of the  <dig> genes affected by this perturbation,  <dig> genes are directly correlated and  <dig> genes show more than 3x differences between background expression level and predicted expression level after perturbation. of the  <dig> genes affected between  <dig> to  <dig> jumps,  <dig> are significantly different after bonferroni correction between predicted expression level before and after perturbation. these  <dig> genes were analyzed for gene ontology enrichment using goeast
 <cit> . all  <dig> significant molecular functions enriched were of carbon/sugar transferase-typed activity . this agrees with recent findings associating hydrogenase  <dig> to hydrogen production during glucose
 <cit>  or glycerol fermentation
 <cit> .

expression buffer of hydrogenase  <dig> maturation endopeptidase 
knowing that 56% knockdown of hybd has an impact on the native transcriptome, it is plausible to consider the question of expression buffer. that is, how much expressional variation of hybd must occur before the underlying native transcriptome is affected? in this case study, we explore this question on a background of e. coli mg <dig> pure culture .

using 10% stepwise perturbation of hybd from knockout to 2x over-expression , our results suggest that the number of affected genes is symmetrical and fits a quadratic model . by solving the roots of the quadratic model, we estimate that an expression between  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the original expression  does not affect the transcriptome of e. coli mg <dig>  in addition, our results also suggest that a reduced model of  <dig> data points  is a good estimate , suggesting the possibility to reduce computational time if a large number of perturbation analyses are needed. the reduced model estimated an expression buffer between  <dig> % and  <dig> % of  <dig> .

hence, the predictor may be used to provide estimation to a research question proposed by selinger et al.
 <cit>  – what are the effects of 50% versus 60% knockdown of hybd? our results suggest that  <dig> genes are affected when hybd is knocked down by 50%  compared to  <dig> genes when hybd is knocked down by 60% .

this study provides baseline and test cases for future work
in this study, we present a potential means to predict virtually the entire transcriptome from a set of  <dig> source genes, which may be useful for synthetic biologists to predict the effects of transgene
 <cit> . in addition, our predictor has the potential to examine the effect of one or more genes when their expression is/are changed
 <cit>  and shown to perform comparatively to previous studies on predicting prokaryotic gene expressions using sequence features such as codon usage bias
 <cit> .

using the simplest statistical model to relate the expression values of  <dig> genes, this study acts as a baseline for future work. non-linear or higher-order regression models
 <cit> , may be used to improve prediction accuracy. the prediction accuracy may also be improved with additional microarray data as they come online or including data from less noisy sources, such as from rna sequencing. at the same time, we had described the test cases used  throughout this study, which can be used to evaluate future improvements to this work.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we demonstrate that the transcriptome of e. coli can be potentially predicted from a set of marker gene expressions or from known perturbation. the former enables thousands of gene expressions to be predicted from a small set of known gene expressions while the latter enables in silico evaluation of the effects gene perturbation such as gene over-expression and/or under-expression. hence, we present a potential means to predict an entire transcriptome and a tool to estimate the effects of gene perturbations for e. coli, which will aid biologists in hypothesis development. this study forms the baseline for future work in using gene co-expression network for gene expression prediction.
