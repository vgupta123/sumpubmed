BACKGROUND

lactobacillus is a genus of gram-positive facultative anaerobic bacteria  <cit> . considered as non-pathogenic and generally regarded as safe, lactobacilli have been widely used for fermentation and food production for centuries  <cit> . the beneficial or probiotic effects of lactobacilli are under intense investigation with both laboratory and clinical studies , suggesting that administration of lactobacilli inhibit cytokine-induced apoptosis  <cit>  and decreases the pathogenicity of various pathogens, such as e. coli  <cit>  and vre  <cit> . however, the molecular mechanisms by which lactobacilli impact vre are incompletely understood.

lactobacilli may exert immunomodulatory effects using multiple mechanisms including binding directly to c-type lectin receptors  or toll-like receptors , on the host cell surface  <cit> . for example, administration of l. casei crl  <dig> increased the expression of tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  and tlr <dig> and improved the production and secretion of tnfα, ifnγ, and il- <dig> in mice  <cit> . alternatively, lactobacilli may produce antimicrobial substances to inhibit the growth of various pathogens. for example, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacilli formed pores in the membranes of pathogens and thus caused leaking of target cells  <cit> . more recently, studies have revealed that extracellular vesicles  and associated proteins from lactobacilli can also modulate the activity of immune cells and affect host innate and adaptive immune responses . for example, evs from lactobacilli were found to enhance cellular tlr2/ <dig> and tlr <dig> responses while suppressing tlr2/ <dig> signaling  <cit> .

extracellular vesicles  are nanometer-scale membrane-contained vesicles released in an evolutionally conserved manner by a wide range of cells  <cit> . by facilitating the transfer of proteins, nucleic acids, and other molecules between cells  <cit> , evs are associated with molecular transport, mediation of stress response and biofilm formation thus influencing their hosts  <cit> . this ev-mediated interaction is likely prevalent in the gut as a major method of communication between bacteria and hosts, since a layer of mucin prevents direct physical contact between bacteria and host tissues  <cit> . another unique feature associated with evs is their potential to mediate therapeutic molecule delivery without inducing adverse immune reactions  <cit> .

in this study, we selected l. plantarum wcfs <dig>  a leading probiotic strain found in the gastrointestinal tract, due to its potency to inducing immunomodulatory effects  <cit> . we found that l. plantarum wcfs <dig> produces evs that are 30–200 nm in diameter. proteomic analysis revealed that l. plantarum derived ev  cargo was enriched with membrane-associated proteins. using the experimental nematode c. elegans, ldev treatment prolonged the survival rates of c. elegans under e. faecium  challenge. to investigate the underlying mechanisms, we found that the host defense genes, cpr- <dig> and clec- <dig>  were significantly upregulated. ldev treatment of human colonic cells lines also led to similar upregulation of ctsb  and reg3g .

RESULTS
l. plantarum produces evs
we isolated evs from the supernatant of l. plantarum wcfs <dig> using exoquick-tc kit   <cit> . the isolated particles were characterized by electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis  and proteomic identification. electron microscopy showed typical ev-like size  and morphologic appearance  . nta analysis, a measure of particle size, revealed that over 80% of isolated evs ranged from 31 nm to 200 nm , within the range of previously described ev sizes between  <dig> and 1000 nm  <cit> . we also used liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry to profile ev protein content.  <dig> proteins were identified in the ev fraction . notably, according to gene ontology analysis, over half of the proteins were found to be associated with membrane, where typical bacterial evs originate   <cit> . in all, these results confirmed that l. plantarum wcfs <dig> produces and release evs.fig.  <dig>

l. plantarum evs are biofunctional and increase the survival of c. elegans
our previous study showed that preconditioning c. elegans with l. acidophilus ncfm prolongs the survival of the nematode after infection with enterococcus faecalis  <cit> . we asked if ev fractions of lactobacilli can also provide similar protective effects. using an agar-based solid killing assay  <cit> , c. elegans were pre-treated with l. plantarum bacteria, ldevs or mock ev’s as described in the methods section. the nematodes were then challenged with a clinically isolated vancomycin-resistant e. faecium c <dig>  compared to the control worms conditioned with mock evs, c. elegans conditioned with l. plantarum wcfs <dig> bacteria survived significantly longer  . this result is similar to that previously obtained using l. acidophilus  <cit> . notably, worms pre-treated with ldevs also survived significantly longer  than those treated with mock evs. we did not observe significantly different survival between ldev treated and l. plantarum treated groups .
fig.  <dig> conditioning with ldevs prolonged the survival of c. elegans nematodes infected with vre. compared to the worms conditioned with mock evs, significantly longer survival was found in the ldev conditioned worms . l. plantarum wcfs <dig> conditioned worms also had significantly  longer survival than those conditioned with mock evs. there was no statistical difference in survival between worms conditioned with ldevs and with l. plantarum wcfs <dig> bacteria




l. plantarum evs up-regulate host defense genes, clec- <dig> and cpr- <dig> in a c. elegans model
the protection induced by ldevs prompted us to investigate the possible immunomodulatory effects of ldevs on c. elegans. our previous research had shown that five host defense genes  were significantly up-regulated when c. elegans were conditioned with l. acidophilus ncfm   <cit> . when l. plantarum bacteria were applied to c. elegans, a similar significant up-regulation of clec- <dig> , cpr- <dig> and lys- <dig> was observed . when c. elegans were treated with l. plantarum derived evs, we observed a significant up-regulation of gene expression for the c-type lectin clec- <dig>  and the gut-specific cysteine protease cpr- <dig> .fig.  <dig> expression profiles of host defense genes when c. elegans were conditioned with lactobacilli and then ldevs. a rnas of five host defense genes  were significantly  up-regulated when c. elegans fer-15;fem- <dig> were conditioned with l. acidophilus ncfm . data are derived from qpcr with fold change in gene expression listed below each gene. b rnas of clec- <dig>  cpr- <dig> and lys- <dig> were significantly  up-regulated when c. elegans fer-15;fem- <dig> were conditioned with l. plantarum wcfs <dig>  c significant  up-regulation of clec- <dig> and cpr- <dig> was associated with ldev conditioned c. elegans fer-15;fem-1





l. plantarum evs incubation led to ldev cargo delivery and up-regulation of host defense genes, ctsb and reg3g in caco- <dig> cells
having established the immunomodulatory effects of ldevs in the nematode model, we next investigated the impact of ldevs on caco- <dig> cells as a model of human colonic epithelium  <cit> . ldevs were fluorescently labeled with exo-green and then incubated with caco- <dig> cells for 24 h. we observed ~25% of caco- <dig> cells retained the fluorescent label after washing. no detectable fluorescence was observed from the mock ev control, which went through the same ev isolation and labeling procedures . incubating ldevs with caco- <dig> cells did not impact the viability of the mammalian cells . next, we tested if the two genes that showed significantly increased expression in c. elegans, clec- <dig>  and cpr- <dig>  translated to the mammalian model system. ctsb  <cit> , the cysteine proteinase, is the human orthologue of cpr- <dig>  there is no direct human orthologue of clec- <dig> based on sequence homology. we, therefore, investigated reg3g, an intestinally secreted c-type lectin that likely has functional similarity  <cit> . both ctsb and reg3g rnas were significantly up-regulated in caco- <dig> cells after the ldev treatment . this upregulation of ctsb and reg3g confirmed the results obtained from c. elegans model.fig.  <dig> 
a the incubation of ldevs with caco- <dig> cells led to cargo delivery from ldevs to caco- <dig> cells. compared to mock evs, only ldevs treated caco- <dig> group showed positive fluorescence. b the incubation of ldevs did not cause any significant toxicity to caco- <dig> cells. mtt assay was employed to examine the viability of caco- <dig> cells 24 h after they were treated with mock evs or ldevs. c ldevs increased gene expression of ctsb and reg3g in caco- <dig> cells. at 24 h post-incubation, the rna expression of ctsb  and reg3g  were significantly up-regulated in the ldev treated group




discussion
the importance of evs has been increasingly recognized. virtually all kinds of cell types studied so far secret evs, and they are also found in various bio-fluids  <cit> . this phenomenon indicates that evs are evolutionarily conserved and likely functionally important  <cit> . indeed, numerous studies on mammalian cell derived evs have shown that evs play important roles in intercellular communication and mediation of immunomodulatory response  <cit> . however, ev-mediated interactions between host and bacterial pathogens are less explored. limited studies suggest that pathogenic bacterial strains affect biofilm formation via ev pathways  <cit> . a recent study on probiotic bacteria has also shown evs from multiple lactobacillus strains modulate host-microbe responses by regulating the tlr <dig> activity and phagocytosis  <cit> . here, we focused on l. plantarum, a gut-associated commensal bacteria often used in probiotic nutritional supplements. we found that l. plantarum wcfs <dig> produces functional evs that enhance host defense gene expression and directly augments protection against vre infections. these findings suggest ldevs, at least partially, mediate the immunomodulatory properties of probiotic lactobacilli.

it is interesting to note that l. plantarum derived evs up-regulate clec- <dig> and cpr- <dig>  while the l. plantarum bacteria promote the expression of both genes and cpr- <dig>  the shared upregulation of clec- <dig> and cpr- <dig> suggest that l. plantarum derived evs retain much of the immunomodulatory effects of l. plantarum. this is probably because evs have similar cargo contents as their parental bacteria  <cit> . the different regulation observed with gene cpr- <dig>  however, illustrates that bacterial evs are not equal to the intact bacteria regarding the spectrum of induced immunomodulatory effects.

our experiments using human caco- <dig> cells confirmed biological activity of the ldevs. both reg3g  <cit> , which is functionally similar to clec- <dig>  and ctsb  <cit>   are upregulated by ldev treatment. reg3g is an intestinally secreted c-type lectin with potent bactericidal activity against gram-positive bacteria  <cit> . it also promotes the spatial segregation of microbiota and host in the intestine  <cit> , thus decreasing the chance of bacterial colonization on the intestinal epithelial surfaces  <cit> . ctsb, a cysteine proteinase involved in cell death and inflammation  <cit> , is associated with antibacterial activity  <cit> . although it may involve autophagy  <cit> , the exact mechanism of ctsb on bacterial pathogens is unclear.

this study provided a mechanistic insight as to how ldevs enhance host immune response via upregulation of the two host genes, reg3g and ctsb.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our study revealed that evs produced from l. plantarum up-regulate the expression of host defense genes, clec- <dig> and cpr- <dig>  and provide protection against vre infection in a c. elegans model. ldev treatment of human colonic cells lines also led to similar upregulation of ctsb and reg3g. the findings of this study could be harnessed to design a new therapeutic treatment of antimicrobial resistant infections by using evs derived from probiotic strains rather than the bacteria themselves.
