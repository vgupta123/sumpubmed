BACKGROUND
prrsv, a positive sense and single-stranded rna virus, is a member of family arteriviridae  <cit> . since it was emerged in the united states in  <dig> and in europe in  <dig>  prrsv has rapidly spread in the swine producing regions and became one of the most important devastating diseases of swine worldwide. it can cause severe reproductive failure in sows and respiratory distress in young growing pigs  <cit> . infection with prrsv also made pigs easy to secondary infection by other pathogens  <cit> . up to date, since there is no efficient method or drugs against prrsv, it is very important and urgent to develop the effective therapeutic strategies to control prrs.

the prrsv genome has nine open reading frames  composed of orf1a, orf1b, orf2a, orf2b, and orf3- <dig>  orf1a and orf1b could produce  <dig> nonstructural proteins  . previous studies have shown that the nsp <dig> of equine arteritis virus, which is another member of family arteriviridae, may play a key role in viral rna synthesis and additional functions in the viral life cycle  <cit> . other and our previous work also demonstrated that prrsv nsp <dig> inhibited the host innate immune responses such as the transcription of type i interferon  <cit> , the rnai innate immune response  <cit>  and the nlr family pyrin domain-containing  <dig> -mediated production of il-1β  <cit> , which indicated that prrsv nsp <dig> may play an important role in prrsv infection. so the purpose of present study is to explore the effect of over-expression of nsp <dig> on prrsv infection and whether the sirnas targeting the prrsv nsp <dig> could influence prrsv infection.

firstly, we successfully constructed the expression plasmid of pcdna  <dig> -gfp-nsp <dig>  and the western blot in fig. 1a confirmed the successful expression of gfp-nsp <dig> . secondly, the marc- <dig> cells were cultured in 24-well plates overnight, and then the cells were transfected with the expression plasmid pcdna <dig> -gfp-nsp <dig> or the control plasmid pcdna <dig> -gfp. the results in fig. 1b showed that the prrsv titers from the marc- <dig> cells transfected with pcdna <dig> -gfp-nsp <dig> were about one point six times to that from marc- <dig> cells transfected with control plasmid, while the rna levels of prrsv from the marc- <dig> cells transfected with pcdna <dig> -gfp-nsp <dig> were three times to that from marc- <dig> cells transfected with control plasmid .fig.  <dig> over-expression of nsp11enhenced the titers of prrsv. a 293t cells were transfected with pcdna <dig> -gfp  or pcdna <dig> -gfp-nsp <dig> , and 48 h later, the cells were analyzed by western blots. b marc- <dig> cells cultured in 24-well plate were transfected with pcdna <dig> -gfp-nsp <dig>  or pcdna  <dig> -gfp . and 6 h later, the cells were infected with prrsv at an moi of  <dig>  or mock infected, and 24 h later, the cells were lysed by freezing and thawing three times in three cycles, then the viral titers were measured by tcid <dig>  c marc- <dig> cells cultured in 24-well plate were transfected with pcdna  <dig> -gfp-nsp <dig>   or pcdna <dig> -gfp . and 6 h later, the cells were infected with prrsv at an moi of  <dig>  or mock infected, and 24 h later, the cells were collected and the viral rna levels were measured by rt-pcr. data represented means of three replicates, and experiments were repeated three times. error bars represented the standard deviations. *: p < <dig>  compared with the results in control. moi: multiplicity of infection



sirnas targeting nsp <dig> reduced prrsv titers in marc- <dig> cells
now that over-expression of nsp <dig> could enhance prrsv titers, it was reasonable to design sirnas targeting nsp <dig> to investigate whether the sirnas could reduce prrsv titers. the sequences of the sirna special for nsp <dig> and the control sirna were listed in table  <dig>  293t cells  or marc- <dig> cells  grown in 24-well plates were co-transfected with the nsp <dig> sirna  or control sirna and the plasmid gfp-nsp <dig> . and 24 h later, the cells in five random fields were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy  and only one of them was shown in fig.  <dig>  the results in fig.  <dig> showed that all of the three sirnas targeting nsp <dig> could inhibit the expression of gfp-nsp <dig> and didn’t influence on the expression of gfp.fig.  <dig> sirnas targeting nsp <dig> could inhibit the expression of gfp- nsp <dig> and didn’t influence on the expression of gfp in 293t cells or in marc- <dig> cells. 293t cells  or marc- <dig> cells  cultured in 24-well plates were co-transfected with pcdna  <dig> -gfp-nsp <dig> or pcdna <dig> -gfp  and nsp <dig> sirna  <dig> , nsp <dig> sirna  <dig> , nsp <dig> sirna  <dig> or control sirna . and 24 h later, the cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy . data represented means of three replicates, and experiments were repeated three times



finally, we selected two sirnas  targeting nsp <dig> to determine whether sirnas targeting nsp <dig> could reduce prrsv titers in marc- <dig> cell. the western blots results in fig. 3a confirmed that sirna <dig> and sirna <dig> could efficiently reduce the nsp <dig> expression in 293t cells . the results in fig. 3b and c showed that sirnas targeting nucleic acid sequence of nsp <dig> could significantly reduce viral titers of prrsv  and reduce rna levels of prrsv .fig.  <dig> sirnas targeting nsp <dig> could efficiently reduce the titers of prrsv. a 293t cells grown in 24-well plates were transfected with pcdna <dig> -gfp-nsp <dig> or pcdna <dig> -gfp  and nsp <dig> sirna  <dig> , nsp <dig> sirna  <dig>  or control sirna , then 36 h later, the cells for collected for the western blot. b marc- <dig> cells cultured in 24-well plates were transfected with nsp <dig> sirna  <dig> , nsp <dig> sirna  <dig>  or control sirna . and 6 h later, the cells were infected with prrsv at an moi of  <dig>  or mock infected, and 24 h later, the cells were lysed by freezing and thawing three times, then the viral titers were measured by tcid <dig>  c marc- <dig> cells grown in 24-well plates were transfected with nsp <dig> sirna  <dig> , nsp <dig> sirna  <dig>  or control sirna . and 6 h later, the cells were infected with prrsv at an moi of  <dig>  or mock infected, and 24 h later, the cells were collected and the viral rna levels were measured by rt-pcr. data represented means of three replicates, and experiments were repeated three times. error bars represented the standard deviations. *: p < <dig>  compared with the results in control. moi, multiplicity of infection



the endoribonuclease activity of nsp <dig> was important for nsp <dig> to enhance the prrsv titers
our previous work has shown that the endoribonuclease activity of nsp <dig> was important for nsp <dig> to inhibit the transcription of ifn-β  <cit>  and the secretion of il-1β  <cit> . so next we investigated whether the endoribonuclease activity of nsp <dig> was important for nsp <dig> to promote the prrsv infection. nedialkova et al. showed that his- <dig>  his- <dig>  and lys- <dig> were the catalytic centers, and mutating one of the three amino acids could abolish its enzyme activity. the results in fig.  <dig> showed that inactivating the endoribonuclease activity made nsp <dig> not promote the prrsv infection.fig.  <dig> the endoribonuclease activity of nsp <dig> was important for nsp <dig> to enhance the prrsv titers. marc- <dig> cells cultured in 24-well plate were transfected with pcdna <dig> -flag-nsp <dig>  , pcdna <dig> -flag-nsp <dig> h129a   or pcdna  <dig> -flag . and 6 h later, the cells were infected with prrsv at an moi of  <dig>  or mock infected, and 24 h later, the cells were lysed by freezing and thawing three times in three cycles, then the viral titers were measured by tcid <dig>  data represented means of three replicates, and experiments were repeated three times. error bars represented the standard deviations. *: p < <dig>  compared with the results in control. moi, multiplicity of infection



discussion
nsp <dig> was a multi-functional protein. both our and other previous studies have shown that prrsv nsp <dig> is an interferon antagonist  <cit>  and that nsp <dig> plays an important role in viral rna synthesis and in the viral life cycle  <cit> . our recent work also demonstrated that prrsv nsp <dig> inhibited the rnai innate immune response  <cit>  and nlrp3-mediated production of il-1β  <cit> . while our present work showed that over expression of prrsv nsp <dig> could enhance the titers of prrsv , so our present work gave a directly evidence that nsp <dig> was an important viral component for up-regulating the prrsv titers.

identification of and targeting viral important components is useful for developing viral vaccine and controlling the virus. for example, both the nonstructural protein  <dig> of influenza virus and the nonstructural protein  <dig> of mouse hepatitis virus  were important for the viral virulence respectively, and both the modified live-viral vaccines that deletion of nonstructural protein  <dig> resulted in complete protection against challenge with influenza virus infection and mhv infection respectively .

rna interference  is an exciting method to silence viral genes. inhibition of specific genes by sirna has proven to be a potential therapeutic strategy against viral infection  <cit> , especially for the positive single stranded rna viruses since their genomes function as both the mrna and the replication template  <cit> . up to date, rnai has been used against several viruses such as hepatitis b virus, foot-and-mouth disease virus, dengue virus and so on . in this work, we also explore whether the sirna, which targeted the nucleic acid sequence of nsp <dig>  influenced the titers of prrsv, and the results showed that sirna targeting nsp <dig> significantly reduced the titers of prrsv . a recent improved live prrsv vaccine has indicated that the orf1a and orf1b were the virulence determinants of prrsv  <cit> . in addition, our recent work also show that rnai innate immune response was an antiviral response to prrsv and prrsv inhibited this response by prrsv nsp1α and nsp <dig>  which indicated that targeting nsp <dig> would be useful for rnai innate immunity against prrsv  <cit> . so it is reasonable to propose that our present results gave a new clue for generating the new prrsv vaccine by targeting prrsv nsp <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our present study has shown that nsp <dig> was an important viral component for up-regulating the titers of prrsv and that sirnas directly targeting nsp <dig> could inhibit prrsv infection, which indicated that prrsv nsp <dig> may be an interesting target for controlling prrsv in future.
