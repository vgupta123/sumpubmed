BACKGROUND
neisseria gonorrhoeae  is a gram-negative bacterium and a human-specific pathogen that causes gonorrhea. this sexually transmitted disease remains a global health burden. the world health organization estimated  <dig>  million new cases in adults in  <dig>  which was a 21 % increase compared to  <dig>  <cit> . the disease usually manifests as cervicitis, urethritis, proctitis, conjunctivis, or pharyngitis. a significant proportion of women  and some men  undergo asymptomatic infections and therefore many cases remain undiagnosed  <cit> . untreated or inadequately treated gonorrhea often has serious long-term health consequences including endometritis, pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, epididymitis, and infertility . the serious sequelae of gonorrhea are exacerbated by a significant increase of the risk of hiv acquisition  <cit> . pharmaceutical interventions against gc infections are limited to antibiotic regimens, as a preventive anti-gonorrhea vaccine does not exist. antibiotic therapies, however, have been continually challenged by the remarkable ability of the bacteria to acquire and retain resistance  <cit> . treatment failures associated with the current emergence of gc with decreased susceptibility to the last effective treatment option, third-generation cephalosporins, are concerning and emphasize the pressing need for the development of alternative antimicrobial strategies to combat drug-resistant gonorrhea .

here, we focus on biochemical and functional characterization of the gc homolog of conserved bacterial obg gtpases, ngo <dig> , as a target for the discovery of anti-gonorrhea compounds. obg proteins  belong to the obg-hflx superfamily within the trafac  class of p-loop  gtpases . the obg family is comprised of four subfamilies: obg, nog <dig>  drg, and ychf. the family exists in all three domains of life with bacteria possessing obg and ychf, archea having two obg proteins and ychf, and eukaryotes commonly encoding four obg proteins and ychf . structurally, the bacterial obg proteins contain highly conserved n-terminal- and central-domains, and c-terminal domain that can vary in length and sequence, or as in chlamydia, may even be absent  <cit> . the n-terminal domain is glycine-rich and has a unique fold, the obg fold  <cit> . the signature gtp-binding domain shares overall topology with the small ras-like gtpases, but the biochemical features of the obg proteins are distinct from those of eukaryotic ras-like proteins .

the name obg originates from spo0b-associated gtp-binding protein of bacillus subtilis, in which the obg gene was identified as a part of the spo0b operon  <cit> . since its identification in  <dig>  obg homologs have been demonstrated to be essential for viability not only in b. subtilis, but also streptomyces coelicolor, staphylococcus pneumoniae, s. aureus, haemophilus influenzae, caulobacter crescentus, escherichia coli, vibrio harveyi and v. cholerae . these findings strongly suggest that obg proteins are crucial for the survival of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the depletion of cellular obg levels results in species-specific pleiotropic effects on bacterial physiology, including alterations of ribosome maturation and dna synthesis; cell division and morphology; and induction of general, as well as ppgpp-mediated stringent stress responses  <cit> . growing lines of evidence support the link between obg and ribosome function. obg predominantly associates with the 50s ribosomal particles, and long-term obg depletion results in reduced levels of 70s monosomes, ribosomal proteins s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig> and l <dig>  as well as a perturbed polyribosome profile . recent studies suggest that in e. coli cultured under standard laboratory growth conditions, obg acts as a checkpoint in the final steps of 50s subunit assembly and, via an interplay with ppgpp, might modulate the production of large ribosomal particle in response to environmental cues  <cit> . introduction of the temperature-sensitive variant of obg, g80e, in c. crescentus caused a decline in both the growth rate and the amount of 50s subunits, even under permissive conditions  <cit> . additional ribosome defects were not observed in non-permissive temperatures; however, the bacteria rapidly halted cell cycle progression and lost viability. thus, the essential nature of obg likely does not result directly from its function in the late stages of 50s subunit assembly  <cit> . obg might provide a key molecular nexus between different metabolic pathways to regulate cellular processes in response to the energy status of the cell  <cit> . all obg proteins characterized to date bind gdp and gtp, and display relatively slow gtp hydrolysis, which can be moderately stimulated in the presence of purified 50s ribosomal particles . the mechanistic insights into how obg participates in different metabolic paths and stress responses remain to be elucidated. nevertheless, the obg proteins appear to be promising molecular targets for the development of broad-spectrum antibiotics against drug-resistant bacterial infections because of their essential nature, conservation, and strong link with pivotal physiological processes.

RESULTS
local gene context and obggc domain architecture
in virtually all bacteria the obg gene has been reported to be physically linked to rplu and rpma, encoding 50s ribosomal proteins l <dig> and l <dig>  respectively  <cit> . the inspection of the genetic organization of the obg region in available completed genome sequences of neisseriaceae, however, revealed that this arrangement is not followed. in gc strain fa <dig>  the putative protein ngo <dig>  annotated as obg, is the last orf in a cluster comprised of ngo <dig> and ngo <dig>  ngo <dig> is a hypothetical protein present also in gc dgi <dig> and pid24- <dig>  whereas ngo <dig>  encoding a homolog of the rrna small subunit methyltransferase i, is located upstream of obg in other neisseriaceae.

analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence of ngo <dig> from fa <dig> revealed a typical structure of obg gtpases  and significant similarities to other obg proteins . the n-terminal domain of obggc  contains  <dig> glycine residues, similar to the b. subtilis obg  <cit> . the central, gtp-binding domain , includes five conserved g motifs  and two switch elements  that determine the active or inactive state of the g protein  <cit> . as expected, the c-terminal domain shows the lowest conservation when compared to obg homologs from different bacterial species . nevertheless, this region of obggc contains clusters of acidic residues, a feature characteristic of obg proteins  <cit> . this charged c-terminus has been shown to be important for obg association with 50s ribosomal particles in c. crescentus as well as gtp and gdp binding in v. harveyi  <cit> .fig.  <dig> obggc domain architecture. the individual structural domains of obggc are shown in green. the n-terminal domain  is glycine-rich. the central, gtp-binding domain  includes two switch elements  and five conserved g motifs . the c-terminal domain contains clusters of acidic residues. the conserved t <dig> and t <dig> residues within the g <dig> motifs and introduced substitutions are designated in red

purification of obg variants and evaluation of anti-obggc antisera
to begin the characterization of obggc, n- and c-terminally his-tagged versions of the wild type ngo <dig>  n-his-obggc and c-his-obggc , were overexpressed in e. coli bl <dig>  and purified. the purified recombinant n-his-obggc was subsequently used to obtain polyclonal rabbit anti-obggc antisera. the antisera specifically recognized both the native and recombinant versions of obggc . the purified proteins migrated in sds-page more slowly than the native protein and accordingly with the deduced molecular mass of obggc  with the addition of the histidine epitope. further, the antibodies cross-reacted with obg homologs in the n. meningitidis serogroup b strains mc <dig> and nz98/ <dig> but failed to recognize obg from n. weaveri and e. coli despite their  <dig> and 56 % identity to obggc, respectively . it is possible that the anti-obggc antisera bind to the highly variable c-terminal domain of obggc.fig.  <dig> validation of polyclonal rabbit anti-obggc antisera.  the polyclonal rabbit anti-obggc antibodies were used to probe the whole-cell lysates derived from wild type fa <dig> and isogenic plac::obg
gc as well as purified variants of obggc. the bacteria were harvested following 2 h of growth in gcbl with  and without  100 μm iptg, and the samples were matched by equivalent od <dig> units. purified recombinant proteins  include wild type obggc with n-terminal 6 × his tag,  and n-his-obggc with t192at193a substitutions.  samples of whole-cell lysates derived from various neisseria species, as indicated, were harvested from gcb and matched by equivalent od <dig> units. all samples were separated in 4-20 % mini-protean tgx precast gels, the proteins were transferred onto the nitrocellulose membrane and probed with polyclonal rabbit anti-obggc antisera raised against n-his-obggc




obggc binds gtp and gdp
gtpases cycle between being turned “on” in the gtp-bound state and turned “off” in the gdp-bound state . in each state, g proteins undergo conformational changes and downstream effectors sense the gtp-bound protein complexes. switch-off involves the exchange of gtp for gdp or hydrolysis of the γ-phosphate of gtp. the fluorescent n-methyl-3’-o-anthranoyl  guanine nucleotide analogs, mant-gtp and mant-gdp, have been widely utilized for examining the nucleotide binding and gtp hydrolysis of various g-proteins including obg homologs. the highly environmentally sensitive fluorescence of the mant group enables detection of nucleotide-protein interaction . the binding of gtp to obg requires the presence of physiological mg2+ concentrations in c. crescentus, e. coli, and v. harveyi, whereas obg-gdp complexes form over a wide range of mg2+ concentrations  <cit> . the total intracellular mg2+ content is about 100 mm in e. coli and b. subtilis and includes bound and free mg2+, with the latter ranging from 1–5 mm .fig.  <dig> biochemical properties of obggc. a gtpase cycle. obg gtpases oscillate between active  and inactive  states. b obggc binds mant-gtp and mant-gdp with guanine nucleotide-specific mg2+ dependence. binding of mant-gtp  and mant-gdp  to n-his-obggc was assessed in the presence of varying concentrations of mg2+. the averages with sem from three independent experiments are shown. c increase in relative fluorescence units  of mant-gtp  and mant-gdp  upon addition of different obggc variants: recombinant wild type obggc with n- and c-terminal 6 × his tag , and n-his-obggc with t192at193a substitutions. the data shows averages with corresponding sem of at least eight experiments performed on separate occasions. d hydrolysis of mant-gtp by n-his-obggc  and c-his-obggc  was monitored by recording the decrease in fluorescence that is coupled to the conversion of mant-gtp-obg to mant-gdp-obg complexes. data from at least four experiments were fitted to a single exponential decay equation. the fluorescence intensity of the mant-gtp in the absence of protein served as a control and is shown in black



to determine whether obggc requires mg2+ to optimally bind mant-nucleotides, n-his-obggc was incubated with increasing concentrations of mg2+ and either mant-gtp or mant-gdp. the obggc binding profiles obtained for both nucleotides differed noticeably similarly to that observed for other obg family members  <cit> . the optimal formation of mant-gtp-obggc complexes occurred between  <dig> and 10 mm mg2+, as indicated by maximal fluorescence . the binding of mant-gdp to obggc did not require mg2+ and was inhibited at above 1 mm concentrations .

subsequently, binding of mant-gtp and mant-gdp was assessed for both n-and c-his-obggc, as addition of a six-histidine epitope to the c-terminus of the v. harveyi obg completely abolished interaction with gtp and resulted in a weak binding of gdp  <cit> . likewise, the c. crescentus obg containing influenza virus hemagglutynin tag demonstrated a reduction in protein function  <cit> . in contrast, the c-his-obggc showed very similar properties to n-his-obggc . binding of either variants of obggc to mant-gtp and mant-gdp led to  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold enhancement in mant-nucleotide fluorescence, respectively. these results suggest that subtle perturbations to the c-terminus of obggc are not detrimental to protein function. the c. abortus obg naturally lacks the c-terminal domain, yet the protein is a functional gtpase, with similar activity to other obg proteins, and binds to the 50s large ribosomal particle  <cit> .

mantgtp hydrolysis by obggc
we next examined the gtpase activity of purified n-his-obggc and c-his-obggc by monitoring the decrease in fluorescence that is associated with the single-turnover conversion of bound mant-gtp to bound mant-gdp . the peak of fluorescence was recorded for 3 h at 1 min intervals. the reduction in fluorescence was fitted to a single exponential decay with a first-order rate constant, kh, of  <dig>  × 10−4 s−1and  <dig>  × 10−4 s− <dig>  or half life  of  <dig>  min and  <dig>  min, for n-his-obggc and c-his-obggc, respectively. therefore, the gtp hydrolysis rates of both obggc variants are very similar and are approximately twenty times slower than that of the v. harveyi obg and two-fold slower than c. crescentus and e. coli obg proteins, respectively  <cit> . these differences may reflect distinct obg control or function in distantly related bacterial species.

alteration of switch i element of obggc abolishes gtp but not gdp binding abilities
the two adjacent threonine residues, t <dig> and t <dig>  which coordinate mg2+, are ubiquitously present within the g <dig> domain of obg proteins . however, their function has been assessed only in c. crescentus  <cit> . to address their importance for guanine nucleotide binding in obggc, the double t192at193a mutant protein with n-terminal-his epitope was constructed and purified. compared with the wild type obggc, the mutated protein exhibited completely impaired mant-gtp binding, whereas a  <dig> -fold increase in fluorescence was observed in the presence of mant-gdp, indicating unaffected formation of obg-gdp complexes . a similar effect was observed in the c. crescentus obg, and t <dig> was identified as the pivotal residue. the obg t193a allele was not able to support c. crescentus growth, which demonstrated that the obg gtpase activity was a prerequisite for cell viability  <cit> .

depletion of obggc has deleterious effect on gc survival
to examine whether obggc plays a critical function in gc physiology, we used an allelic exchange approach and placed ngo <dig> under the control of the isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside -inducible promoter, plac, in its native chromosomal locus in gc fa <dig>  the resulting conditional knockout strain, fa <dig> plac::obggc, failed to grow when inoculated directly from the freezer stocks onto the gonococcal base agar solid medium  lacking iptg, whereas robust bacterial growth was observed in the presence of the inducer .fig.  <dig> obggc is essential for gc viability. a the fa <dig> conditional obg knockout strain, plac::obg
gc, failed to grow when plated from freezer stocks onto gcb without  100 μm iptg, whereas abundant growth was observed on media supplemented with the inducer . b, c fa <dig> cells carrying chromosomal plac::obg
gc were collected from gcb agar plates supplemented with  <dig> um iptg, washed, divided, and grown in gcbl in the presence or absence of iptg for 3 h. at this experimental time point , the bacteria were harvested, washed again and growth was continued for 6 h in liquid media with  or without  iptg, as indicated. culture density was measured as optical density at od <dig> . cell viability was monitored every hour after the second inoculation by spotting serial dilutions onto gcb with iptg . experiments were performed in biological triplicates and means and sem are presented. d representative immunoblot showing obggc levels over time in fa <dig> plac::obg
gc grown in the presence  and absence  of iptg. the samples were collected every hour after back dilution , matched by the same od <dig> units, and whole cell lysates were probed with anti-obggc antisera. e cultures of fa <dig> plac::obg
gc grown in the liquid media in presence  and absence  of iptg were serially diluted and spotted on gcb with  and without  the inducer. the 2- and 4-h time points from back dilution are shown



subsequently, to examine the effect of obggc depletion on gc viability over time, non-piliated and translucent colonies of fa <dig> plac::obggc, harvested from gcb supplemented with 100 μm iptg, were washed, suspended to the same od <dig> of  <dig> , divided, and cultured in gonococcal base liquid  medium in the presence or absence of iptg. after 2 h under repressive conditions, obggc was still detectable by immunoblotting  and the bacterial proliferation rate was indistinguishable from the permissive condition . similarly, depletion of c. crescentus obg using the pxyl promoter and repressive growth conditions  resulted in much lower but detectable levels of obg even 12 h after a carbon shift  <cit> .

prolonged culturing of gc is not feasible because the bacteria undergo autolysis shortly after reaching stationary phase . therefore to ensure significant reduction in the amount of obggc, the conditional knockout strain fa <dig> plac::obggc was first treated as described above, cultures were collected 3 h after initial inoculation , washed, and back diluted into fresh gcbl with or without the inducer. culture density and bacterial viability, measured as optical density at 600 nm  and colony-forming units , respectively, were monitored every hour. growth kinetics of fa <dig> plac::obggc cultured in the presence of iptg  closely followed the pattern observed in parental wild type strain . in contrast, under non-permissive conditions, the culture density and bacterial viability were decreased significantly , concomitant with the reduction in obggc level . at 6 h of the experiment, the obggc-depleted culture contained on average  <dig>  ×  <dig> live bacterial cells, whereas  <dig>  ×  <dig> were present in permissive conditions . further, fa <dig> plac::obggc grown in liquid media in the presence of iptg was unable to survive upon plating on gcb lacking the inducer , confirming our prior observations .fig.  <dig> expression of obggc. the growth of fa <dig>  and obggc amounts  were examined during regular aerobic conditions in gcbl by measurements of bacterial turbidity  and immunoblotting analyses of whole cell lysates every hour. the graph shows means with corresponding sem from biological triplicate experiments. samples were matched by equivalent od <dig> units and representative immunoblots are shown. immuoblotting with anti-ng-mip antisera was used as a loading control. c the immunoblot probed with anti-obggc antisera was scanned and subjected to densitometric analysis. to quantify the intensity of the obggc protein bands, the volume tool, local background subtraction, and linear regression methods were used. d the expression of obggcwas assessed in whole cell lysates derived from gc cultured on gcb aerobically, in iron-limited conditions, in the presence of  <dig>  % normal human sera, and anaerobically in the presence of nitrite as a terminal electron acceptor. immunoblotting analyses with anti-tbpb and anti-ania antisera were used as controls for iron-depleted  <cit>  and anaerobic  <cit>  growth conditions, respectively. samples of whole-cell lysates were matched by the same od <dig> units  with the exception of detection of ania during anaerobic growth conditions, where  <dig>  od <dig> units were used



together, these studies demonstrate that obg plays a pivotal function in gc physiology, as the depletion of obggc caused loss of gc viability.

expression of obggc
the expression of obg protein varies in different examined bacterial species. for instance, in s. coelicolor obg is expressed in a growth-dependent manner with a sharp decline right after the beginning of aerial mycelium development and at the end of vegetative growth  <cit> , whereas constant levels of obg are maintained throughout the c. crescentus life cycle  <cit> .

to examine the expression of obggc, wild type fa <dig> was maintained under routine aerobic cultivation in gcbl. bacterial proliferation was monitored by measurements of cell density at od <dig> within 6 h of the experiment . every hour gc samples were collected and the whole cell lysates were probed with anti-obggc antisera. the same samples were also examined using antibodies against an unrelated protein, ng-mip  and by sds-page coupled with colloidal coomassie staining  as loading controls. immunoblotting and densitometry analyses  showed that obggc reached maximum expression in the early logarithmic phase of gc growth at od600 ~  <dig>  , and remained constant until stationary phase.

we also asked whether the conditions that more closely resemble clinical infection, such as anoxia, iron deprivation and, in the event of disseminated infection, exposure to human serum  <cit> , influence expression of obggc. as expected, immunoblotting analysis showed increased levels of tbpb and ania, which are well-recognized protein markers for iron-limited  <cit>  and anaerobic  <cit>  growth conditions, respectively . in contrast, the cellular concentrations of obggc remained unaltered during growth of wild type fa <dig> on gcb aerobically, in iron-limited conditions, in the presence of  <dig>  % normal human sera, and anaerobically in the presence of nitrite as a terminal electron acceptor.

subcellular localization of obggc
the subcellular fractionation experiments showed that obg was localized in the cytosol  <cit>  and partially associated with the crude cell envelopes in e. coli  <cit> , whereas in s. coelicolor, immunoelectron microscopy indicated that obg was associated with the cytoplasmic membrane  <cit> . in addition, a growing number of reports show that different members of the obg family cofractionate primarily with the 50s ribosomal subunit  <cit> ; however, in mycobacterium tuberculosis, obg is present in the 30s, 50s, and 70s ribosomal fractions  <cit> .

to examine the cellular localization of obggc, wild type fa <dig> was cultured under standard laboratory conditions in gcbl and harvested at the mid-exponential phase of growth. the bacterial cells were lysed and the cell envelope proteins were separated from the cytosolic proteome by a sodium carbonate extraction procedure  <cit> . the crude cell envelopes were treated with sarkosyl to solubilize the inner membrane proteins, and the outer membrane was recovered by ultracentrifugation  <cit> . the same total amounts of purified subproteomes  were separated by sds-page and probed with anti-obggc antisera . the outer membrane protein, mtre, which contains an extended periplasmic tunnel  <cit> , was used as the cell envelope protein marker. as expected, mtre was absent in the cytosol and enriched in the sarkosyl-insoluble fraction, whereas the vast majority of obggc was present in the cytosolic protein fractions . a faint band of the same molecular weight was also detected in the cytoplasmic membrane. many cytoplasmic proteins are repeatedly identified in different cell envelope proteomics studies and are often considered “contaminants”  <cit> . however, recent thorough sequential biochemical fractionations of e. coli, combined with mass spectrometry, demonstrated that many of these proteins, including obg, form an actual peripheral inner membrane proteome linked via functional and/or structural oligomeric complexes  <cit> .fig.  <dig> obg is a primarily cytoplasmic protein that predominantly fractionates together with the 50s ribosomal particles. a samples of isolated subproteome fractions  obtained from wild type fa <dig> cultured under regular aerobic laboratory growth conditions were separated in 4-20 % gradient gels and probed with either polyclonal rabbit anti-obggc antisera or monoclonal mouse anti-mtre antibodies. b fa <dig> cell lysate was subjected to separation on a 10-47 % step sucrose gradient by ultracentrifugation at  <dig>  × g for 4 h and monitored by uv absorbance at 254 nm. the positions of the 30s and 50s ribosomal subunits, the 70s monosomes, and polyribosomes are indicated. the level of obggc in the collected fractions was detected by immunoblotting with polyclonal rabbit anti-obggc antibodies. a representative polyribosome profile and immunoblot are shown



next, we addressed whether obggc cofractionates with the ribosomes by ultracentrifugation of gc cell lysates through sucrose gradients and analysis of the polyribosomes profiles. most of the cellular proteins accumulated at the top of the gradient followed by the peaks for small and large ribosomal subunits, the 70s monosomes, and the polyribosomes . immunoblotting analysis with anti-obggc antisera showed that under these conditions, the greatest amounts of obggc were in 50s fractions and at the top of the gradient.

based on these results, we conclude that obggc is largely localized to the cytosol and primarily associates with the 50s ribosomal particle and not with the 70s monosomes or with translating ribosomes. association of a part of the obggc cellular pool with the cytoplasmic membrane may have functional implications, as obg has been shown to be involved in key cellular processes such as ribosome maturation, dna synthesis, cell division and morphology. obg could be recruited to the membrane-bound complexes on demand, depending on the metabolic status of the bacterial cell.

obggc is expressed by contemporary clinical isolates of gc
finally, the conservation of the predicted amino acid sequence of obggc was assessed using the completed genome sequences of strains fa <dig>  and nccp <dig> , as well as the draft genome sequences of  <dig> different gc strains . these analyses demonstrated that obggc is 100 % identical among  <dig> strains and has a single amino acid change in the gc isolates designated as dgi <dig> and pid <dig> .

subsequently, to examine expression of obggc, a diversified panel of gc isolates was utilized. this panel included common laboratory strains ms <dig>  f <dig>  and  <dig>  as well as  <dig> strains isolated from different gonorrhea patients from distinct geographical areas and at different time points. the anti-obggc antibodies detected a band of the same size in all examined gc isolates, albeit the level of expression varied between some strains .fig.  <dig> the polyclonal rabbit anti-obggc antibodies cross-react with cell lysates of  <dig> diverse gc strains. samples of whole-cell lysates derived from various gc isolates  harvested from gcb were matched by equivalent od <dig> units and resolved in 4-20 % tris-glycine precast gels. the proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and probed with polyclonal rabbit anti-obggc antisera



CONCLUSIONS
targeting essential proteins and critical cellular processes that are widely conserved remains an attractive avenue in antibacterial drug discovery programs. compounds interfering with ribosome function and biogenesis and thus inhibiting different aspects of protein synthesis are among the most clinically useful antibiotics in spite of evolutionary conservation of bacterial and mitochondrial ribosomes  <cit> .

here, we show for the first time that obggc is a gtpase essential for gc viability, mainly associated with the 50s large ribosomal subunit, abundant during different growth phases as well as under environmental conditions relevant to infection, and conserved in gc isolates. together, these findings underscore the potential of obggc as a target for the development of therapeutics against gonorrhea.
