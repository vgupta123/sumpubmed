BACKGROUND
plant morphological traits have important effects on rice yield, and elite plant architecture should include short stature, few unproductive tillers, thick and sturdy stems, more grains per panicle and erect leaves  <cit> . moreover, these traits are controlled by multiple quantitative loci. until now, most quantitative trait loci  were identified using bi-parental linkage mapping populations. for tiller number and angle, moc <dig>  a gene that is important in the control of rice tillering, was mapped on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . tac <dig>  a major tiller angle  gene, was identified on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . la <dig>  which regulates shoot gravitropism to control ta, was detected on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . prog <dig>  which controls ta and the number of tillers, was mapped on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . for plant height, the green revolution gene, sd <dig>  was mapped on chromosome  <dig> and encodes ga20ox  <cit> . moreover, ipa <dig>  which profoundly changes rice plant architecture and substantially enhances rice grain yield, was located on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . additionally, d <dig> acts as a repressor of strigolactone signaling, and a d <dig> mutant produced an exaggerated number of tillers to control rice plant architecture  <cit> . for leaf architecture, a classic gene, nal <dig> with pleiotropic effects on multiple traits, including polar auxin transport and vascular patterns, was characterized on chromosome  <dig> . a great many of the flag leaf architecture qtls  have been isolated, such as lc <dig>  <cit> , qfll <dig>   <cit> , qfl <dig>  <cit> , qflw <dig>   <cit>  and qlschl <dig>  <cit> . for panicle type, qpe9- <dig>  <cit>  and ep <dig>  <cit>  were two erect panicle qtls, and sp <dig> leads to a short-panicle phenotype  <cit> .

although linkage mapping is a powerful method to detect qtls, the discovery of qtls is limited by the material used. based on the historic recombination in diverse germplasm indicated by the presence of linkage disequilibrium  between markers and qtls across the genome, genome-wide association studies  are considered to be an excellent way to uncover the genetic variations of complex traits using a large natural population  <cit> . in the past few years, gwass were successfully applied to the dissection of complex traits in humans  <cit>  and animals  <cit> . in  <dig>  gwass were successfully applied to the analysis of  <dig> phenotypes in arabidopsis thaliana inbred lines  <cit> . subsequently, gwas research has been implemented in crops such as rice , maize  <cit> , soybean  <cit>  and wheat  <cit> .

compared with a qtl linkage analysis, gwas is commonly performed using a large unrelated diverse germplasm to increase the diversity of alleles and haplotypes  <cit> . a high-density snp map and comprehensive hapmap have been constructed in rice   <cit> . however, limited studies have been carried out to analyze rice morphological traits systematically based on the high-density map. in our study, we used a systematic gwas in  <dig> diverse accessions for  <dig> phenotypes in two environments, lingshui , hainan province and hangzhou , zhejiang province, china in  <dig>  the goals of this study were  to uncover the genetic architecture of morphological traits, including tiller number, ta, flag leaf architecture and panicle characteristics;  to identify a substantial number of significant loci related to morphological traits for candidate gene identification and elite allele analysis; and  to discover elite breeding lines for rice plant architecture and yield improvement. the results will aid our understanding of mechanisms underlying rice morphological traits, and provide valuable theoretical knowledge for rice genomic selection and breeding by design.

methods
plant materials
the gwas experiment comprised  <dig> rice germplasm accessions , which were collected from  <dig> countries, representing the major rice-growing regions of the world . to limit the influence of strong population differentiation between the two subspecies, we only chose  <dig> indica accessions, most of which were from southern china . these accessions, with three replications, were planted in a randomized complete block designed of  <dig> column ×  <dig> row, with spacing of 20 cm among the plants in ls and hz in  <dig>  for each block, the four plants in the middle block were selected to evaluate phenotypes to eliminate the marginal effects. the measurement methods of  <dig> morphological traits are summarized in additional file 2: figure s <dig> fig.  <dig> material distribution and germplasm diversity. a geographic origins of  <dig> rice samples. the pie charts on the world map represent the country-specific distribution. the size of the pie chart shows the sample size, and colors within each pie chart reflect the proportion of indica  and japonica ; b most of the indica accessions are distributed in southern china; c grain with rich phenotypic variations; d brown rice with different pericarp colors



snp genotype calling
rice genomic dna was extracted from the young leaf tissue of each of the  <dig> accessions, which had been grown in the experimental field of the china national rice research institute in hangzhou in  <dig>  all of the accessions were genotyped using illumina custom-designed arrays by following the infinium hd assay ultra protocol  . the array consisted of  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphisms  that were chosen from the rice haplotype map project database   <cit> . genotypes of these accessions were called using genome studio . the quality of each snp was confirmed manually, and a few of the snps of low quality and a minor allele frequency < 5 % were removed from the dataset. finally,  <dig>  snps were used for the gwas analysis .

genotypic data analysis
major allele frequency, gene diversity, polymorphic information content   and population differentiation  among different subpopulations  were calculated using powermarker version  <dig>   <cit> . based on the bayesian markov chain monte carlo  program, the genetic component of each accession and the number of subpopulations , ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> in all of the population , were inferred using structure version  <dig>   <cit> . in the analysis, five independent runs with a burn-in period of  <dig>  steps and  <dig>  mcmc replications were implemented. the ancestry model allowed for population mixture and correlated allele frequencies. both the value of log likelihood  and an ad hoc statistic Δk  <cit>  were used to reveal the suitable population structure. the results of the five independent runs were integrated using the clumpp software  <cit>  and then generated as a q-matrix for further association mapping. a neighbor-joining  tree was constructed based on nei’s genetic distance  <cit>  between pairwise individuals under powermarker version  <dig>   <cit> . furthermore, according to the nei’s genetic distance matrix, a principal component analysis  was performed using ntsyspc version  <dig>   <cit> . finally, the pairwise relatedness coefficients were calculated using spadige version  <dig> c with the negative values among individuals set as zero and then all the values were doubled to obtain the k matrix for further analysis  <cit> .

estimation of ld decay
the ld parameter r <dig> was computed using tassel version  <dig>   <cit>  to evaluate the level of ld between linked snps. the ld decay rate was measured as the chromosomal distance at which the average pairwise correlation coefficient dropped to half of its maximum value  <cit> . the ld block was calculated using haploview  <dig>   <cit> .

phenotypic variation and correlation
a total of  <dig> morphological traits were evaluated in two environments. the statistical analyses of mean, standard error  and broad-sense heritability  were calculated using microsoft office excel  <dig>  the broad-sense heritability was computed through an analysis of variance using the following formula: hb2=σg2/σg2+σe <dig>  

where σg <dig> is genetic variance and σe <dig> is error variance. correlation coefficients among the  <dig> agronomic traits were computed by r . an anova was carried out to evaluate the effects of genotype , environment  and genotype × environment  using sas system  <dig>  , and the percentage of phenotypic variation explained by population structure was also carried out in sas  <dig> .

genome-wide association
an association analysis was performed using tassel version  <dig>   <cit> , and the emma  <cit>  and p3d  <cit>  algorithms were performed to reduce computing time. four models including glm, q, k, and q + k were used to evaluate the effects of population structure and relative kinship. the glm model: without any factor as covariate; the q model: q-matrix as covariate; the k model: k matrix as covariate; and the q + k model: both q and k matrix as covariates. the glm and q models were performed using a general linear model program. however, the k and q + k models were computed under a mixed linear model program  <cit> . the two model program equations can be expressed as y=xα+eandy=xα+qβ+kμ+e, 

respectively, where y was the vector of phenotypic observation, α was the vector of snp effects, β was the vector of population effects, μ was the vector of kinship effects, e was the vector of residual effects, q was the matrix from structure relating y to β, and x and k were incidence matrices of 1 s and 0 s relating y to α and μ, respectively  <cit> . for the comparison, we adopted two significant thresholds, the minimum bayes factor )  <cit>  and the bonferroni   <cit> . in this study, we used 1/n  as the cutoff for all traits except for pericarp color .

for the significant marker-trait associations, the elite and null alleles were used to determine the choice of elite accessions for further breeding by design. the formula for calculating phenotypic effect of alleles can be described as a=∑i=1nχi/n−∑j=1myj/m, 

where xi was the phenotypic value of accession carrying the i allele, yj was the phenotypic value accession carrying the j allele, and n and m represented the number of accessions. if a was positive, then the i allele was defined as an elite allele with an increasing effect and the j allele was defined as the null allele with a decreasing effect, and vice versa. in our study, we chose parental accessions with elite or null alleles based on the characteristics of different traits.

candidate gene expression profiling
the expression levels of  <dig> ta candidate genes were measured by quantitative real-time pcr  using eight accessions with large tas at the seedling, early and later tillering stages, respectively. total rna was extracted from the base of tiller tissue using a minibest plant rna extraction kit . complementary dna  was synthesized by primescript rt master mix . the reaction was performed on an abi step-one plus real time pcr system . the expression level of actin was used to standardize the data for each run. the expression experiment was performed at three replications for each sample. the qpcr primers and materials are summarized in additional file 5: table s <dig>  duncan’s multiple comparison was performed by spss  <dig>   at  <dig>  significance level.

RESULTS
material distribution and genotyping array
rice germplasm resources maintain most of their genetic diversity during the process of domestication . in our study,  <dig> accessions of o. sativa collected from  <dig> countries  were genotyped using the illumina custom-designed genotyping array containing  <dig>  snps. the snps with minor allele frequencies < 5 % were deleted from the dataset to avoid problems of spurious ld and false positive associations. finally,  <dig>  snps of high genotyping quality were used for the gwas analysis . for these snps,  <dig>  % inter-marker distances were less than 100 kb and only  <dig>  % were more than 400 kb .fig.  <dig> proportion of the  <dig>  snps categorized by inter-snp  distances. d represents the distance between two adjacent snps



population divergence
we first calculated the genetic component of each variety using structure . the results showed that the lnp value for each given k, from  <dig> to  <dig>  increased but did not show a maximum value . the value of evanno’s Δk showed the highest peak at k =  <dig> . therefore, we speculated that the two subspecies, indica and japonica, were present in major groups , and the result was also confirmed by the nj tree . in addition, the fst between indica and japonica was  <dig> , suggesting a strong level of differentiation between the two subspecies , which was in close agreement with a previous report  <cit> .fig.  <dig> population structure of  <dig> rice samples. a mean lnp values plotted as the number of subpopulations; b Δk values plotted as the number of subpopulations; c subpopulations inferred using structure; d nj tree based on nei’s genetic distances



given the strong population differentiation between indica and japonica subspecies, only  <dig> indica accessions, most of which were distributed in southern china , were chosen for further analyses. similarly, we first ran structure  on the panel to evaluate the number of subpopulations, and the genetic component of each variety is shown in additional file 6: table s <dig>  the lnp value increased continuously with k values of  <dig> to  <dig>  meanwhile, the top two peaks of evanno’s Δk appeared at k =  <dig> and k =  <dig> . this result suggested that the genetic structure of the  <dig> indica accessions had two or four classifications, which was supported by the occurrence of two subpopulations  and four groups under two subpopulations . when k =  <dig>  the geographic distribution analyses showed that the group  <dig> accessions were distributed in the yangtze river basin, and the group  <dig> accessions were distributed in both the pearl river basin and southeastern asia . when k =  <dig>  the first subpopulation, pop <dig>  was distributed in the yunnan, guizhou and sichuan provinces. pop <dig> was distributed in the southeastern coastal areas of china. pop <dig> was distributed in the middle-lower yangtze plains and pop <dig> was distributed in southeastern asia . furthermore, we constructed a nj tree based on nei’s genetic distances . there were four clear clades  that represented the four subpopulations . finally, the pca demonstrated that the top two eigenvectors clearly separated these accessions into four subpopulations  shown as pop <dig>  pop <dig>  pop <dig>  and pop <dig> . pc <dig> and pc <dig> accounted for  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of the genetic variation, respectively. combined with the results of the nj tree and pca, we concluded that four suitable subpopulations  can be obtained in the  <dig> indica accessions. moreover, the fst values of the four subpopulations ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , indicating a moderate level of subpopulation differentiation .fig.  <dig> population structure of  <dig> indica samples. a mean lnp values plotted as the number of subpopulations; b Δk values plotted as the number of subpopulations; c subpopulations  inferred using structure; d nj tree based on nei’s genetic distances. blue, red, green, purple and black represent pop <dig>  pop <dig>  pop <dig>  pop <dig> and mixed, respectively; e principal component analysis



relative kinship between indica individuals
most of the pairwise relative kinship values were less than  <dig>  . a total of  <dig>  % of the pairwise kinship coefficients were zero, and about  <dig>  % of the kinship values ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . a fraction of kinship values  showed various degrees of relatedness from  <dig>   to  <dig> , and only  <dig>  % of the values were larger than  <dig>  . this pattern of relative kinship demonstrated that there was no or weak relatedness in the complex indica panel.fig.  <dig> distribution of pairwise relative kinship coefficients



ld analysis
the pairwise snp ld parameter r <dig> was analyzed using tassel  <dig>   <cit> . a regression analysis between r <dig> and genetic distance indicated that they fitted the equation y = − <dig> ln +  <dig>   . therefore, the genome-wide ld decay distance was ~ <dig>  kb at which the r <dig> dropped to half its maximum value  . then, according to the same strategy, the ld decay rate of each of the  <dig> chromosome was estimated. the shortest ld decay distance was  <dig>  kb on chromosome  <dig>  and the longest was  <dig>  kb on chromosome  <dig>  the average decay distance was  <dig>  kb . these results were consistent with previous studies that cultivated rice had a long-range ld decay distance from ~100 kb to ~200 kb  <cit> . given that most of the inter-marker distances were less than 100 kb , we expected to have a reasonable power to detect common large-effect variations in the indica panel.fig.  <dig> estimation of genome-wide average ld decay distance in the indica panel



phenotypic variation and correlation
a wide range of phenotypic variations were observed for the  <dig> morphologic traits in ls and hz . the average hb <dig> was  <dig>  %, ranging from  <dig>  % for flag leaf length  to  <dig>  % for pericarp color . the average percentage of phenotypic variation explained by population structure was  <dig>  %, indicating that phenotypic variation was influenced by population structure. hence, the q-matrix was necessary as a covariate for the gwas analysis to control false positive associations.table  <dig> phenotypic variation, explanation and broad-sense heritability of each trait in the indica panel

different model comparison
to control false positive trait-marker associations, four models, glm, q, k and q + k, were compared with each other using the quantile-quantile  plot shown in fig.  <dig>  for all  <dig> traits, the q, k and q + k models were significantly better than the glm model, which did not consider the influence of population structure or relative kinship. moreover, the k model was better than the q model. additionally, the q + k model, controlling both population structure and relative kinship, was a little better than the k model in reducing the type i errors. for the four models, the number of significant snps identified at p <  <dig>  × 10− <dig>  is shown in fig.  <dig>  in ls, the number of significant snps was sharply reduced from  <dig>   to  <dig> , then to  <dig>  and finally to  <dig> . in hz, the trend was the same as in ls. these results illustrated that the false positive associations were greatly controlled only when using the q + k model. thus, we chose this model for the gwas analysis.fig.  <dig> quantile-quantile plots for  <dig> morphological traits in two environments. a tiller number; b tiller angle; c plant height; d flag leaf length; e flag leaf width; f the ratio of flag leaf length and width; g flag leaf angle; h panicle number; i panicle type; j panicle length; k pericarp color; l hull color. distribution of p-values assuming associations  are represented as gray lines; distribution of p-values calculated based on the four models  are represented as different colored lines; ls, lingshui; hz, hangzhou

genome-wide association mapping and expression analysis
a total of  <dig> significant snps were identified in ls and hz. to select major loci among all the significant snps, the snps with the lowest p-values were maintained within a 200-kb window according to the average ld decay rate in the panel. finally, in ls and hz,  <dig> and  <dig> significant snps, including known and new candidate loci, respectively, were identified for the  <dig> traits and all of the significant loci explained ~ <dig>  %  and  <dig>  %  of the phenotypic variation on average, respectively .table  <dig> summary of associations for  <dig> traits in the two environments, lingshui and hangzhou

for tiller number in hz, the highest snp peak  was detected on chromosome  <dig>  with the snp explaining ~ <dig>  % of the total phenotypic variation, and  <dig> candidate genes were predicted within 200 kb . for ta, a significant snp  was identified on chromosome  <dig> both in ls  and hz , explaining ~ <dig>  % and ~ <dig>  % of the total phenotypic variation, respectively. moreover,  <dig> candidate genes were contained within 200 kb. for fll in hz, a significant locus of seq-rs <dig>  was mapped on chromosome  <dig>  explaining ~ <dig>  % of the total phenotypic variation and  <dig> candidate genes were obtained. for flw in hz, seq-rs <dig>  was detected on chromosome  <dig>  explaining ~ <dig>  % of the total phenotypic variation and  <dig> candidate genes were predicted. for panicle type  in ls, a peak snp of seq-rs <dig>  was observed on chromosome  <dig>  explaining ~ <dig>  % of the total phenotypic variation and  <dig> candidate genes were included. for pc, two significant snps, seq-rs <dig> and gwseq-rs <dig>  explained ~ <dig>  % of the phenotypic variation in ls and ~ <dig>  % in hz were mapped on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. in addition,  <dig> and  <dig> candidate genes were predicted . coincidentally, the two candidate loci were also detected in a previous study using a different indica gwas panel  <cit> . this demonstrated that the snp array was capable of capturing the major common variants responsible for morphological traits. moreover,  <dig> of  <dig>   associations were detected across two environments, and  <dig> candidate genes were predicted in the rice genome annotation project database .

to verify the effectiveness of our gwas loci, the new ta locus  containing  <dig> candidate genes  detected in two environments was chosen to test the association . fourteen of the candidate genes with typical gene structures were used to explore gene expression levels in seedling, early and later tillering stages using eight large ta accessions . most of candidate gene expression levels showed fold changes between two different stages , especially the expression levels of loc_os08g <dig> , loc_os08g <dig> , loc_os08g <dig>  and loc_os08g <dig>  in the later tillering stage, which were up to  <dig> -,  <dig> -,  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold higher, respectively, than in the seedling stage . the results indicated that the four candidate genes are promising targets participating in the regulation of ta in this region.fig.  <dig> association mapping and candidate gene expression levels. a manhattan plot on chromosome  <dig> for tiller angle in two environments and the strongest signal locus, containing  <dig> candidate genes in a 360-kb genomic region. red squares represent the genes validated by qpcr. b, c, d and e the relative expression levels of loc_os08g <dig>  loc_os08g <dig>  loc_os08g <dig> and loc_os08g <dig> in different tillering stages. different capital letters above the bar plots represent duncan’s multiple comparison at  <dig>  significance level



linkage and pleiotropy
gene linkage and pleiotropy are common phenomena in plant biogenetics. in our study, out of the  <dig> significant snps,  <dig> known or new candidate snps showed clear signal linkage or pleiotropy that was associated with multiple traits in the two environments . the nal <dig> locus at ~ <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig> was closely related to flw, fllw and pn in ls. moreover, the correlation coefficients of flw-fllw , flw-pn  and fllw-pn  were highly significant in ls . the rc locus at ~ <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig> was correlated with both pc and hull color  in ls, and the correlation coefficient was  <dig>   . in addition, some new candidate loci having gene linkage or pleiotropy were observed as well. for example, the loci at ~ <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig> and at ~ <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig> were highly associated with pc and hc, similar to the rc locus. in particular, a long genome region from ~ <dig>  to  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig>  including nine loci, was associated with both fll and fllw in hz . an ld block analysis of the nine loci showed that these markers had low ld parameter  values except for markers seq-rs <dig> and seq-rs <dig> . the results demonstrated that a hotspot on chromosome  <dig> surely existed, not because of the ld block. in conclusion, natural and artificial phenotypic selection may explain gene linkage and pleiotropy in rice domestication.fig.  <dig> summary of  <dig> significant loci across different traits and regions in two environments. each row represents a trait, and each column represents a marker significantly associated with multiple traits. different colors shown in the legend correspond to different significance levels. tn, tiller number; ta, tiller angle; ph, plant height; fll, flag leaf length; flw, flag leaf width; fllw, the ratio of flag leaf length and flag leaf width; fla, flag leaf angle; pn, panicle number; pt, panicle type; pl, panicle length; pc, pericarp color; hc, hull color; ls, lingshui; hz, hangzhou

elite alleles and breeding by design
the effects of elite alleles for  <dig> traits that are directly related to rice plant architecture are summarized in additional file 16: table s11). without considering the effect of interactions among these loci, the more elite alleles were pyramided in varieties, with the larger average phenotypic values increasing significantly . the results indicated that enhancing the frequency of elite alleles has a significant effect on rice phenotypic improvements. however, some traits, such as ta, flag leaf angle  and pt, should pyramid more null alleles to obtain lines with erect plant architecture.

based on the characterization of the new plant type   <cit>  and the effects of elite alleles,  <dig> favorable varieties were chosen as breeding parents to modify the present high-yield plant type . the phenotypes of these favorable varieties closely meet the npt standards  <cit> , for example, lower tiller  and unproductive tiller numbers, erect plant type , ideal plant height , moderate fll , wider flw , erect leaf and pt, and larger panicles. the number of elite alleles carried by these varieties is listed in additional file 18: table s12). in the two environments, most of the elite varieties were different, indicating that morphological traits were highly affected by environment, which was also supported by the anova . moreover, in different environments, the rice plant type modification depended on different parents and combinations. however, two elite accessions  were found repeatedly in two environments, indicating that the two varieties possess unique phenotypes and ideal numbers of elite alleles.

discussion
rice is a staple food and provides energy for more than half of the world’s population. in recent decades, rice production has only increased slightly and improving rice yields has become a pressing problem. plant type modification is a potential way to solve these challenges. the npt was characterized by khush et al. in the 1990s to change rice plant architecture to enhance rice production  <cit> . in this study, a gwas was performed using a larger natural population than in previous studies  <cit> . these materials originated from  <dig> countries, which represented all of the major rice-growing regions in the world . in addition,  <dig> morphological traits were systematically measured in two different environments. this work can comprehensively reveal the genetic architecture of morphological traits and will provide elite parents for rice plant type modifications.

although gwas is a feasible tool to reveal complicated genetic variations in rice, it may be highly affected by population structure, resulting in false positive associations  <cit> . structural association and genomic control are two common strategies performed in human and plant association mapping to reduce the rate of false positive loci . in our studies, the association panel only included indica subspecies to control false positive associations. in addition, the program structure was used to uncover population structures in the indica panel for a further gwas analysis  <cit> . four subpopulations  and a mixed group were obtained and subsequently supported by a pca, which was consider to be another fast and effectively inferred population structure  <cit>  . because of domestication and artificial selection, genetic relatedness among individuals, which generated numerous spurious associations, is inevitable in the association panel  <cit> . in this work, familial relationships were estimated using spagedi, which is a versatile program that analyzes spatial genetic structures  <cit> . about 83 % of the kinship coefficient values were less than  <dig>  , indicating that there was no or weak relatedness between pairwise varieties in the panel .

as mentioned above, population structure  and relative kinship  play key roles in controlling type i error. therefore, combining the two factors has been suggested to reduce the false positive loci in association mapping  <cit> . in this study, four models with different combinations of k and q were performed for all of the traits in the two environments. the q + k model was regarded as the best model to reduce the rate of false positive associations . these results were also supported by an earlier study in maize  <cit> . consequently, the q + k model was considered to be the ideal choice for our association mapping.

ld plays an extremely important role in association mapping and determines the resolution of an association study  <cit> . in our study, the ld decay distance varied over  <dig> different chromosomes, ranging from ~ <dig>  kb on chromosome  <dig> to ~ <dig>  kb on chromosome  <dig> . this may be due to the differences in the recombination rates on the  <dig> chromosomes. moreover, the whole genome-wide and the average ld decay distances were  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb, respectively . this is in agreement with the previous calculation  <cit>  but much larger than maize   <cit> . these results indicated that ld extends over a much longer distance in self-pollinated species, such as rice  <cit> , soybean  <cit>  and arabidopsis  <cit> , than in cross-pollinated crops, such as maize  <cit> . marker density is another factor in the power of the association analysis. taking the rice ld decay rate into consideration, even though our average marker density is ~ <dig> snp per 100 kb in the whole genome , which is lower than in previous studies  <cit> , we also expected to have reasonable power to detect common genomic large-effect variations in our study.

to date, many morphological genes  have been identified in rice using the bi-parental mapping strategy . compared with linkage mapping, the gwas method not only provides a higher mapping resolution but also enables the detection of a greater number of candidate loci  <cit> . hence, gwas has been widely performed to reveal the genetic variation of complex traits in rice , maize  <cit> , soybean  <cit>  and wheat  <cit> . to better understand the genetic variation of morphologic traits in rice, gwas was conducted for  <dig> traits in two environments. a total of  <dig> significant loci, including both reported and new loci, were identified , and  <dig>  loci were detected across the two environments . morphological traits are highly affected by environment, which was supported by the anova  and a previous study  <cit> . for the new loci detected in the two environments,  <dig> candidate genes were obtained within a 200-kb genomic region  in the rice genome annotation project database , and the functional variants, together with the effects of these genes, will be tested and validated using genetic transformation in the future. moreover, the known loci that are directly related to rice plant morphology, such as sd <dig>  <cit> , moc <dig>  <cit> , d <dig>  <cit>  and lc <dig>  <cit> , were not detected in our work. one possible reason was the insufficient snp coverage in some genomic regions, especially near the centromere. another possible explanation was that some genetic variations were actually rare in the indica panel. the third possible reason was false negative associations because of the strict threshold value.

in our study, we observed that some loci were significantly associated with multiple traits in the same or different environments. the typical example was the rc gene at ~ <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig>  which was highly associated with both pc and hc traits in ls , supported by a correlation coefficient value between the two traits  . previous reports showed that nal <dig> had pleiotropic effects on leaf anatomy, photosynthesis rate, spikelet number and grain yield . our results indicated that nal <dig> was associated with flw, fllw and pn in ls , and the correlation coefficient values of flw-fllw, flw-pn and fllw-pn were also significant . in addition, an extensive region  described as ‘mountain range’  <cit> , which was associated with fll and fllw, was identified in hz . that this was caused by several genes  that contribute to the two traits was confirmed by the ld block analysis . this result demonstrated that the ‘mountain range’ may be critical for rice leaf architecture and was maintained during rice domestication.

the results of the allelic analysis demonstrated that with the continual pyramid of elite alleles, the average phenotypic value increases significantly , and these elite alleles will be beneficial to rice improvement in the future. based on the characterization of npt  <cit>  and the elite alleles ,  <dig> elite varieties were obtained as breeding parents to modify the plant architecture. furthermore, rice morphological traits were highly affected by the environments , and most of these traits were significantly correlated with each other . hence, rice plant type modification depends not only on the pyramiding of elite alleles but also on the effects of the local environment. more importantly, the interactions among these loci should also not be ignored.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, we identified a number of significant marker-trait associations and candidate genes, and also uncovered the genetic variations of rice morphological traits using the gwas strategy in  <dig> indica accessions. moreover,  <dig> significant loci, including  <dig> candidate genes, were obtained across two environments. relative expression analyses identified four candidate genes as the most promising regulators of tiller angle. in addition, many significant loci showed pleiotropy and gene linkage. a long genomic region covering ~ <dig>  mb may be critical for rice leaf architecture. the genetic variants and elite alleles will be useful for rice improvement. furthermore, the biological validation of the candidate genes will be focused on in future research. genome selection and breeding by design using the elite varieties as parents will also be of interest in future.
