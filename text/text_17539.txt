BACKGROUND
one of the goals of genetic studies is to characterize genetic variation in individuals with specific conditions in order to identify variants associated with disease or efficacy of treatment modalities. recently, massively parallel sequencing technology has made it possible for an individual's genome to be examined in fine detail. the increased use of this technology, often called next-generation  or deep sequencing, paired with powerful bioinformatic analyses of the resulting data, has facilitated the identification of novel disease-causing variants. targeted sequencing of the genome's coding regions has been used to identify genes associated with rare monogenic disease including kabuki syndrome  <cit> , familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis   <cit> , miller syndrome  <cit>  and van den-ende-gupta syndrome  <cit> . currently, large sequencing projects, such as the  <dig> genomes project   <cit> , are using this technology to characterize human genome variation on a population-based scale. as the cost of deep sequencing continues to decrease, the use of ngs technology will surely increase.

as deep sequencing projects are completed, additional dna from study participants will be needed for replication and follow-up studies. while dna derived from a subject's peripheral whole blood is a preferred source of starting genetic material, continued access to the participant for additional venipuncture may not be possible, or dna isolated from peripheral whole blood may be available in limited quantities. given these limitations, lymphoblastoid cell lines  provide a convenient alternative. lcls, created through the in vitro infection of b-lymphocytes with the epstein-barr virus , can provide an unlimited and lasting resource of the patient's genetic material. lcls are well suited for many types of studies including genome-wide association  <cit> , functional genomics  <cit> , proteomics  <cit>  and pharmacogenomics  <cit> . furthermore, lcls and their dna can be made available to many investigators worldwide through biorepositories  <cit> .

despite the frequent use of lcl for biological research, concerns have been raised regarding potential genomic changes that may be introduced during cellular transformation and subsequent cell culturing. several investigations have addressed this issue. for example, dna copy number changes have been detected following extensive passaging of cell cultures  <cit> . the fidelity of genotype calls between dna derived from lcls and pbmcs from the same individual also has been examined  <cit> . these studies used gene chips to compare genotypes between the paired samples. even though no significant changes were observed, this approach only interrogated the snps represented on the chips. newly induced mutations may be introduced during the creation of the lcls and/or after subsequent expansion of the derived cell lines. recent studies have highlighted the association of de novo mutations with common disorders such as autism  <cit> , schizophrenia  <cit>  and mental retardation  <cit> . therefore, determining if these mutations are real or an artifact of the starting material is of great importance as false-positive results can be introduced into the study design.

recently, within the  <dig> genomes project, the presence of de novo mutations in two trio families was described. the authors estimated that  <dig> % of coding variants identified were de novo  <cit> . since this study used dna derived from lcls, they were unable to compare the results to dna derived from pbmcs in order to determine if these de novo mutations are real or induced through the cell transformation and culturing process.

the aim of the present study was to determine if dna from ebv-transformed b-lymphocytes contains new mutations when compared to dna from untransformed material. to address this, we performed whole exome-sequencing using both pbmc- and lcl-derived genomic dna from a family of  <dig> individuals.

RESULTS
we performed whole exome sequencing on a tetrad family consisting of parents and two siblings, where dna was derived from two sources, pbmcs and lcls. targeted capture efficiency and genomic variants were compared from the dna derived from the two sources .

exome sequencing was performed to high-depth
we sequenced the exomes of  <dig> family members  where the dna from each individual was derived from two sources, pbmcs and lcls. high stringency mapping parameters were used, which allowed for a maximum of  <dig> mismatches. the sequence was aligned to the hg <dig> genome build . in total, an average of ~ <dig> million sequence tags were generated per sample with  <dig> % of the f <dig> tags and  <dig> % of the f <dig> tags mapping to the genome . this equated to an average of  <dig>  gb of mappable sequence per sample. removal of reads that mapped to multiple locations and outside of target regions resulted in an average of  <dig> % of f <dig> tags and  <dig> % of f <dig> tags uniquely mapped to the genome . in total, an average of  <dig>  gb of sequence was uniquely mapped to the genome. this represents an average read depth of 125x with  <dig> % of the targeted sequence covered at least  <dig> times . the targeted exomic capture was performed with similar efficiencies regardless of the initial dna source . a vast amount of robustly mapped sequence was generated. this suggests that targeted genomic capture and subsequent ngs can be performed successfully regardless of the source of the dna.

exome sequencing identified high quality genomic variants
the sequence data was used to identify and characterize genetic variants within the genome. high stringency snp calling parameters were used . this allowed us to identify variants with high confidence while reducing the possibility of false-positive results. in total, an average of  <dig>  variants  were identified per sample  with  <dig> % being novel. comparison between the paired samples, showed a  <dig> % concordance rate.

in total, an average of  <dig>  snps were identified per sample, with  <dig> % of the snps being novel . the majority of the identified snps  were within the coding regions of the genome. these variants included synonymous snps and snps with potential functional impact on the gene's expression . additional snps located in known micrornas were classified, although the functional effect of these snps is not known. the remaining snps  were located within intronic or intergenic regions. these intergenic regions may represent pseudogenes, other non-characterized genes or additional regions coding for small non-coding rnas.

an average of  <dig>  indels was identified. insertions ranging from 1- <dig> bp and deletions up to  <dig> bps were identified . of these, only a small percentage was within the coding region of the genome and the remaining variants were in intronic and intergenic regions. the finding that the number of indels in coding regions was small may be explained by the fact that the majority of these would result in frameshift mutations that would likely alter the protein product, including causing a premature stop.

fidelity of variant calls between different tissue sources
to examine the discordant calls, three steps were performed. first, the sequence quality of the discordant variants was examined to determine if the variant was not called in one of the two samples because it did not pass the variant-calling parameters. second, discordant variants were examined in the context of the family pedigree. finally, a subset of discordant snps was subjected to sanger dna sequencing analysis to confirm their presence.

examining the variant-calling parameters  revealed that the majority of discordant calls were due to the filtering parameters. nearly 50% of these discordant variants were recovered by reducing from  <dig> to  <dig> percent the reads required to call a novel variant. similarly, reducing the minimum read coverage from 8x to 5x recovered an additional 25% of the variants. taken together, these results suggest that variant-calling parameters can be optimized to decrease discordant snps. by changing both the percentage of reads and read coverage settings, the concordance rate between sample types was increased from  <dig> % to  <dig> %.

while the vast majority of variant discrepancies was due to sequencing artifacts and variant calling parameters, we did identify variants that were present in only one of the two-paired samples . these differences represented variants that were present in one of the two dna samples  for each subject. together, a total of  <dig> variants were identified as being discordantly observed. further examination of these snps revealed that  <dig> were both present in multiple samples, and represented within either the dbsnp or  <dig> genomes datasets, suggesting that they are not de novo variants. interestingly, the remaining  <dig> variants were all observed in only a single lcl sample, and were not represented in dbsnp or  <dig> genomes . furthermore, we did identify a range of all  <dig> different types of nucleotide changes that can occur  with c to t changes being the most common . fifteen of these variants were selected for confirmation as being present in the lcl sample using sanger sequencing, which confirmed their presence in the lcl samples only . taken together, this result suggests that a small number of de novo mutations arose during the ebv-transformation process and/or subsequent culturing.

while we did identify variants that were present in the pbmc sample and not the lcl , several lines of evidence suggest that these are not de novo mutations. first, all of these variants were present within multiple family members, in particular parents and children. second, recent studies of de novo mutations suggested that they were novel and not previously characterized; this was not the case here and in fact these variants have been characterized as being common  based upon hapmap allele frequencies. while we would have expected to identify such variants within the pbmcs, the lack of de novo variants may be due to the targeting of only a small fraction of the genome for which no de novo mutations are present. taken together, our results suggest an average concordance rate of  <dig> % between the two-paired samples, leaving a de novo mutation rate of  <dig> %. it should be noted that this de novo mutation rate is for the small portion of the genome sequenced and additional variants may be present in the rest of the genome.

CONCLUSIONS
the aim of this study was to determine if lymphoblastoid cell lines were an acceptable source of dna for deep sequencing studies. while previous studies have examined fidelity of known snps represented on gene chips  <cit> , they did not explore the frequency of de novo mutations in lcl-derived dna when compared to pbmc-derived dna. we thoroughly examined this question using ngs technologies and performed whole-exome sequencing on a tetrad family where dna was available from both pbmcs and lcls. we explored the impact of variant-calling parameters and determined the effects of ebv transformation and culturing on the exome.

we did not observe significant differences in the overall coverage and the targeted exome capture efficiencies between samples derived from pbmcs or lcls. use of high stringency parameters resulted in an average  <dig> % concordance rate of snp calls between the two dna sources . using lower stringency parameters resulted in a variant concordance rate of over 99%; and, furthermore, lowering the minimum mapping quality from  <dig> to  <dig> did not have a significant effect on the concordance rate. however, reducing the requirement of the number of novel allele counts from 20% to 15% had the greatest effect on increasing the variant concordance rate between the two dna sources. thus, the parameters used to identify variants in deep sequencing studies can greatly impact the results, and care should be taken with the interpretation of such results. further examination of a subset of the remaining discrepant variants by sanger sequencing confirmed  the presence of variants in one of the paired samples, suggesting up to a maximum of 1% of the discrepant variants may be the result of de novo mutation caused by ebv transformation and/or cell expansion.

we did observe a higher variability in the concordance rate among indels rather than snps. the short sequence reads produced make it challenging to identify indels from the sequence data. since each sequence read is independently aligned to the reference genome , reads that may span an indel close to the ends of a read are difficult to align with gaps and can potentially be misaligned resulting in false snps. furthermore, reads with indels may be aligned with multiple mismatches to the genome rather than a gap  <cit> . this greater difficulty in correctly mapping reads with indels to the reference genome may have resulted in the higher discordance rate observed between the two-paired samples.

de novo mutations have been identified as a cause for disorders such as autism  <cit> , intellectual disability  <cit>  and schizophrenia  <cit> . these studies highlight the importance of accurately identifying mutations when using exome sequencing. while we did not detect any de novo mutations in the siblings, we did identify differences between the two dna sources. it is feasible that additional de novo mutations could be present within regions of the genome not covered in our sequencing. our results are similar to those previously observed in the  <dig> genomes project, which speculated that  <dig> % of coding variants are de novo. in contrast to the  <dig> genomes project, we were able to directly compare dna derived from two sources from the same individual. while the number of de novo variants identified is a very small fraction of the total variants identified within the lcls , this rate represents only those within the targeted exome. whole-genome sequencing experiments would no doubt identify additional variants. thus, the presence of these variants may introduce false-positive findings into an experiment and further validation and replication of experimental results in additional samples would be required.

there are several limitations to this study. first, our approach focused on the exome, examining  <dig> % of genome, and additional mutations may exist outside these regions. a more comprehensive approach, such as whole genome sequencing would allow for the interrogation of these regions. second, lcls from which the dna was derived were in the pre-immortal state  <cit> . this represents the cell material commonly banked in biorepositories. in the pre-immortal stage, the ebv-transformed cells are actively proliferating and usually have normal diploid karyotypes without tumorigenic properties. after extensive population doublings , lcls reach a proliferative crisis in which pre-immortal cells die and post-immortal cells remain. these cells are often aneuploid and are able to differentiate indefinitely  <cit> . thus, this study did not examine the effects that additional cell passaging may have on the genome. third, it is possible that additional changes, such as copy number and loss-of-heterozygosity may be present in lcl-derived dna; neither of which was examined here. this work suggests that lcls are useful as a surrogate for dna from pbmcs and an acceptable source material for disease association studies using exome sequencing. however, given the presence of a low level of de novo mutations occurring within lcls, it is important to validate and confirm the results in independent sample sets to rule out the possibility of false-positive findings.
