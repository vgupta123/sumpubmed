BACKGROUND
type  <dig> diabetes  is the most common form diabetes, and it accounts for more than 90% of all diagnosed diabetic cases  <cit> . it is a heterogeneous and multi-factorial disease. although the exact pathogenesis has not been fully understood, older age, family history, physical inactivity and race/ethnicity are important risk factors <cit> . african american  is the ethnicity with the highest incidence and mortality rate of t2d. according to  <dig> statistics of adults aged  <dig> years or older,  <dig>  million non-hispanic whites have diabetes , compared to  <dig>  million non-hispanic blacks . after adjusting for population age differences, aas are  <dig>  times as likely to have diabetes as caus at similar ages  <cit> . in addition, obesity and immune/inflammatory processes contribute to the onset of t2d  <cit> . for example, elevated levels of circulating il-1β, il- <dig>  tnfα, and acute phase proteins in t2d have been extensively described in several studies. that may reflect the activation of innate immune cells by excessive levels of nutrient concentration, including glucose and free fatty acids. in turn, both il- <dig> and il-1β act on the liver to produce a characteristic dyslipidemia in metabolic syndrome, one which manifests as increased very low density lipoprotein  and decreased high density lipoprotein   <cit> . il- <dig> and tumor necrosis factor tnfα also participate in the impairment of insulin signaling in adipocytes  <cit> .

many clinical and epidemiological studies have been done to elucidate environmental contribution to t2d  <cit> . microarray analysis will allow us to study genetic contribution and patterns of altered gene expression related to t2d. thus far, human skeletal muscles, liver, adipose tissues, and pancreatic β-cells  <cit>  have been chosen for gene expression assay in t2d. these studies have yielded important insights into the pathogenesis of t2d and its relationship to obesity. for example, adipose tissue gene expression has been found to show more differences between t2d and healthy control than muscle tissue gene expression. many genes are inflammatory and metabolically important  <cit> . because it is difficult to obtain permission from a clinic to use tissue samples such as liver, adipose, and muscle for genetic studies, the peripheral blood could be a convenient source of cells for this study. to date, only one microarray study of human peripheral blood has been reported by grayson et al  <cit> . their finding indicated that genes differentially expressed in t2d have key roles in t-cell activation and signaling, but this study used a limited sample size  and lacked ethnicity information. in this study, we measured the up/down regulation of some t2d-related genes using white blood cells from t2d patients, and we compared the gene expression profiles between two ethnic groups. the information obtained from our study would provide further understanding of the pathogenesis of t2d and the disparities in expression profiles between aa and cau.

RESULTS
characteristics of studied subjects
this study comprised a balanced distribution of the studied subjects in gender and ethnicity: among  <dig> controls,  <dig> were aa including  <dig> females and  <dig> males, and  <dig> were cau including  <dig> females and  <dig> males. among  <dig> patients with t2d,  <dig> were aa including  <dig> females and  <dig> males, and  <dig> were cau including  <dig> females and  <dig> males. as compared to aa, cau had a significantly higher level of blood triglycerides  in both the controls , and the patients . there were no significant differences in other studied clinical parameters between two races . as compared to all controls , the patients group was  <dig>  years older, had significantly higher body mass index , blood tg, and fasting glucose, and had lower high density apolipoprotein . there were no differences in low density apolipoproteins  and total cholesterols  between controls and t2d patients.

data are mean ± sd. statistical analyses were performed using the student's t-test. **p <  <dig>  ***p <  <dig> , values are based on differences from controls.

identification of differentially expressed genes between all t2d patients and healthy controls
whole human genome  oligo-microarrays of peripheral wbcs from  <dig> healthy subjects and  <dig> t2d subjects were performed. of  <dig>  probes available on the agilent arrays, we identified  <dig> genes that were differentially expressed . six known genes were up-regulated, including erythroid associated factor , delta-aminolevulinate synthase  <dig> , oxysterol binding protein  <dig> , carbonic anhydrase i , serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase  <dig> , and zinc finger protein  <dig> . sixteen known genes were down-regulated, including g0/g <dig> switch  <dig> ; telomerase-associated protein  <dig> ; prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase  <dig> ; interleukin  <dig> ; interleukin  <dig> ; interferon alpha-inducible protein  <dig> ; interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats  <dig> ; interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats  <dig> ; tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 6t ; radical s-adenosyl methionine domain containing  <dig> ; apolipoprotein b mrna editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like 3a ; atp/gtp binding protein-like  <dig> ; atp-binding cassette sub-family a transporter ; epithelial stromal interaction  <dig> isoform  <dig> ; ephrin type-a receptor  <dig> ; and leucine rich repeat neuronal protein  <dig> . most of these genes belonged to three functional categories: immune and inflammatory responses, such as il- <dig>  il- <dig>  tnfaip <dig>  and ptgs2; lipid and glucose metabolism, such as abca <dig>  osbp <dig>  and gos2; and organismal injury and abnormalities, such as apobec3a. thus, these genes might be the genetic signatures for t2d.

ethnic differences in gene expression profiles
in order to study ethnic disparities, gene expression profiles between aa and cau participants were analyzed and compared. based on the same criteria described before, many more genes were found to be differentially expressed.  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in aa  compared to  <dig> genes in cau . in the aa group, there were  <dig> down-regulated and  <dig> up-regulated genes in t2d patients; however, we only saw  <dig> down-regulated and  <dig> up-regulated genes in cau t2d patients . it was obvious that aa t2d patients had 2- <dig> times more altered genes than cau t2d patents. table  <dig> summarizes the top  <dig> up-regulated and down-regulated genes in different ethnic groups . overlap analysis showed that aa had an entirely different spectrum of genetic signatures for t2d, because only one down-regulated gene and one up-regulated gene were common between the two ethnicities .

* fold was the ratio of t2d patient to control in each group. the differences in all listed genes.

between t2d patients and controls were < <dig> .

ethnic differences in pathway enrichment analysis
gene expression profiling study showed ethnic disparities in this study cohort as described above. because one pathway usually involves many different genes, it is not clear whether the differentially expressed genes in the two ethnic groups involved the same pathways. using the tool of ingenuity canonical pathways analysis, the differentially expressed genes in two ethnic groups were clustered into various pathways. the top  <dig> down-regulated and up-regulated pathways were identified for t2d patients in aa and in cau as shown in figure  <dig>  similar to the results of differentially expressed single genes, the two t2d patient groups had different spectra of down- and up-regulated pathways. for example, significant enrichments of down-regulated pathways in aa patients were "communication between innate and adaptive immune cells" and "primary immunodeficiency signaling", whereas those in cau patients were "interferon signaling" and "complement system" pathways. the main up-regulated pathways in aa included "inositol metabolism", "wnt/β-catenin signaling", and "lxr/rxr activation", but for cau they were "tight junction signaling", "cleavage and polyadenyation of pre-mrna", and "methane metabolism".

microarray validation by real-time pcr
to confirm the accuracy of the results in microarray study, real-time pcr were performed on  <dig> randomly selected genes  that were found to be differentially expressed in microarray analysis. all of these genes have a known function in glucose and lipid metabolism and in immune responses. the fold changes for the transcripts of these genes were normalized to the transcripts of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ; information of primers for the  <dig> selected genes and gapdh was shown in table  <dig>  the fold changes of those five gene expressions, as determined by microarray and real-time pcr, are shown in figure  <dig>  the results validated our microarray data.

discussion
previous studies of gene expression in t2d have been restricted to adipose tissue and muscle or to animal models with limited sample size  <cit> . before our study, the comparison of blood gene expression in aa and cau with t2d patients was lacking. our analysis of gene profiling in peripheral wbcs from a larger number of sample and ethnic groups begins to fill the gaps. we showed that  <dig> genes are differentially expressed in t2d patients when compared with healthy controls. furthermore, we demonstrated that different gene expression signatures are present in aa and cau patients.

in t2d, we see increased expression of six genes in which five of those have not been previously reported in gene expression studies. eraf is associated with haemoglobin stabilization  <cit> , alas <dig> is involved in immune responses  <cit> , osbp <dig> in lipid metabolism  <cit> , styk <dig> in signal transduction  <cit> , and zic <dig> in transcriptional regulation  <cit> . carbonic anhydrase i, encoded by ca <dig>  has been reported to be progressively increased in the urine of t2d patients  <cit> . interestingly, in our study, we found no evidence for up-regulation of classical inflammatory markers including the interleukin family, the tnf family, or interferon family which have been shown in the literature  <cit> ; however, a panel of genes belonging to those families is down-regulated in our study cohort, including ptgs <dig>  il <dig>  il <dig>  ifi <dig>  ifit <dig>  ifit <dig>  tnfaip <dig>  rsad <dig>  and agbl <dig>  all of those are associated with the interferon signaling pathway, immune signaling pathways involved in inflammatory processes  <cit> . our results suggested that the innate immunity was actually compromised, and significantly lower inflammation was observed in t2d patients. these novel findings are inconsistent with the results from other studies, which may indicate an important difference in the pathophysiology of t2d between the tissues. a recent study  <cit>  also showed that elevated levels of circulating inflammatory markers in t2d may not necessarily reflect the degree of inflammation in individual tissues because of the mass difference. in summary, peripheral wbc gene expression profiling may not mirror the changes of gene expression within a specific tissue such as adipose or muscle.

in addition to inflammatory markers, we found down-regulation of several genes  which are reported to be associated with lipid metabolism and t2d in gene knockout cell lines and/or animal models  <cit> . for example, recent studies have shown that atp-binding cassette transporters abca <dig> and abcg <dig> play important roles in macrophage cholesterol efflux to serum or hdl in macrophage foam cells  <cit> . mice lacking abca <dig> and abcg <dig> accumulate inflammatory macrophage foam cells in various tissues such as lung, liver, spleen, or myocardium  <cit> . therefore, abca <dig> may have a unique role in dampening inflammation. consistent with their finding, our data showed that abca <dig> gene was down-regulated in t2d patients. in addition, we also see that patients had significant lower hdl when compared with control subjects . to our knowledge, this is the first evidence that lower expression of abca <dig> decreases the cholesterol efflux from macrophage, resulting in less hdl formation in t2d patients. in turn, the anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive functions of abca <dig> are diminished.

yang et al.,  <cit>  recently reported that g0s <dig> expression was significantly reduced in white adipose tissues  of db/db mice and high-fat-fed wild-type mice. they speculated that decreased insulin sensitivity of adipocytes may lead to the down-regulation of g0s <dig>  but they are not sure whether expression of g0s <dig> is also decreased in obese humans. our gene expression profiling provided strong evidence that gos <dig> was down-regulated in t2d patients, who also had significant higher bmi compared tohealthy controls.

type  <dig> diabetes  is a complex disease. although the exact pathogenesis has not been fully understood, family history, physical inactivity, socioeconomic condition, and race/ethnicity contribute to the onset of t2d  <cit> . aas have the highest incidence and mortality rate of t2d  <cit> . to better understand the health disparity, we compared the clinical parameters and expression profiles of peripheral wbcs from aa and cau. as described previously, cau had a significantly higher level of blood triglycerides  in both the controls and the patients. there was no significant difference in other clinical parameters between two races. however, as shown in figure  <dig>  aa t2d patients had 2- <dig> times more altered genes than cau t2d patients. in aas, there were  <dig> down-regulated and  <dig> up-regulated genes in t2d patients; however, we only saw  <dig> down-regulated and  <dig> up-regulated genes in caus. the differences were also observed in the top  <dig> up-regulated and down-regulated genes from the two ethnic groups shown in table  <dig>  none of the up- or down-regulated genes overlapped between aas and caus. in agreement with gene expression differences, pathway enrichment study further suggested that aas have different pathophysiological mechanisms of t2d from cau. for example, significant enrichments of top  <dig> down-regulated pathways in aa patients included "communication between innate and adaptive immune cells" and "primary immunodeficiency signaling", whereas that in cau patients were "interferon signaling" and "complement system" pathways. the main up-regulated pathways in aa were "inositol metabolism", "wnt/β-catenin signaling" and "lxr/rxr activation", but these pathways were not significantly altered in cau. taken together, differences between aa and cau participants in expression profiles parallel differences between these groups in pathway enrichment data. ethnic differences in tg cannot explain ethnic disparities. the possibility that cau persons have systematically higher levels of tg warrants further study.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, through the analyses of clinical parameters, expression profiles of t2d, and ethnic differences of gene expression and pathway enrichment, we found that the innate immunity was compromised and significantly lower inflammation was associated with t2d. the newly identified abca <dig> and gos <dig> in human could be used as genetic markers for diagnosis and pharmaceutical drug design. our results also indicated that genes and pathways are differentially expressed between aa and cau t2d patients.

materials and methods
subjects and clinical laboratory data
the study was approved by the institutional review board of tougaloo college. all subjects provided written informed consent for this study. t2d was diagnosed based on american diabetes association  guidelines  <cit>  and characteristic symptoms of diabetes: a higher bmi and a fasting plasma glucose >  <dig> mg dl- <dig> or a  <dig> h plasma glucose during an oral glucose tolerance test of >  <dig> mg dl- <dig>  a total of  <dig> blood samples from healthy controls , and t2d  were collected. all subjects were evaluated by age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index , triacylglycerol , high-density lipoprotein , low-density lipoprotein , total cholesterol , and glucose levels.

rna isolation
total rna from 8- <dig> mls peripheral blood wbcs was obtained using leukolock™ total rna system  according to the manufacturer's instructions. the quantity and quality of the isolated rna were determined by nanodrop spectrophotometry and agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer .

microarray experiments
gene expression profiling was conducted using agilent whole human genome <dig>  oligo arrays with ~ <dig>  genes represented . each sample was hybridized against a human universal rna control .  <dig> ng of total rna was amplified and labeled using the agilent low rna input fluorescent linear amplification kit, according to manufacturer's protocol. for each two color array,  <dig> ng of each cy5-  and cy3-labeled  crna were mixed and fragmented using the agilent in situ hybridization kit protocol. hybridizations were performed for  <dig> hours in a rotating hybridization oven according to the agilent 60-mer oligo microarray processing protocol prior to washing and scanning with an agilent scanner . arrays were processed and background corrected with default settings for all parameters with the agilent feature extraction software .

microarray data analysis
microarray data analyses were processed with genespring version  <dig>  and  <dig> . the sample quality control was based on the pearson correlation of a sample with other samples in the whole experiment. if the average pearson correlation with other samples was less than 80%, the sample was excluded for further analysis. if the scanned intensity was less than  <dig>  for a probe, it was transformed to  <dig>  a perchip  array normalization was performed using  <dig> percentile values of all the probe values in the array. per gene  array normalization was also applied using the median value of a gene across all samples in the experiment. probe features were first filtered using flags. a "present" or "absent" flag was defined using the agilent feature extraction  <dig> . <dig> software. only a probe that had present flags in at least 50% samples of all the arrays was kept for further analysis. data were subsequently log  transformed for statistical analysis. to identify differentiated genes between two groups , an un-paired t-test with cut off p value  <dig>  was applied to compare control samples and tnt exposed samples. in addition,  <dig>  fold changes were applied to identify more significantly regulated genes.

gene functional analysis and pathway analysis
significantly regulated probes were employed for one way hierarchical clustering  or two-way hierarchical clustering  using genespring  <dig>  and/or  <dig> . a pearson correlation with average linkage was applied for the clustering. gene functional categories were classified according to gene ontology   <cit>  using the database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery   <cit>  and gofetch  <cit>  tools. a gene ontology functional term enrichment p value less than  <dig>  was considered significant. pathway analysis was performed using the ingenuity canonical pathways analysis tool. similar to go analysis, a pathway with an enrichment p value less than  <dig>  was considered to be a significantly regulated pathway . gene networks were constructed based on the ingenuity knowledge base. a score was assigned to a network according to the fit of the original set of significant genes. this score reflects the negative logarithm of the p value that indicates the likelihood of the focus genes in a network being found together due to random chance  <cit> .

real-time pcr
to validate the microarray data, a real-time pcr assay was performed using brilliant ii sybr® green system for five genes. samples were selected from the original microarray experiments for further rt-pcr testing based on sufficient rna remaining. glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  expression was used as an internal control and the relative expression of each gene was determined by the ΔΔct method, comparing expression of test gene to an average gapdh, and then comparing the t2d group versus healthy control group. the primers used for cdna amplification are shown in table  <dig>
