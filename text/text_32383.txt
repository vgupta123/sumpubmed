BACKGROUND
antibodies and antibody fragments can deliver a variety of agents, including drugs, genes, toxins or radioisotopes to target cells expressing the appropriate receptor-antigen. internalization of the antibody fragment to the interior of the cell can in many cases increase the therapeutic effect of the therapeutic agent  <cit> . a major advantage of receptor mediated internalization as a drug delivery route is that therapeutic agents can be delivered to target cells that specifically overexpress the receptor-antigen and thereby increase efficacy while reducing systemic toxicity. for example, anti-erbb <dig> antibodies have been used to target doxorubicin containing liposomes  <cit>  or pseudomonas exotoxin  into the interior of erbb <dig> overexpressing tumor cells  <cit> . a considerable fraction of antibodies generated by immunization do not bind receptors in a manner that triggers internalization  <cit> . thus, it is desirable to screen for antibodies that can elicit the desired internalization response.

the most common method for monitoring internalization of ligands and antibodies into cells involves radiolabeling of the antibody, incubation of the labeled antibody with the cells, and use of a low ph buffer  to dissociate surface-bound antibody. however, reports from several laboratories indicate that this buffer in some circumstances only partially dissociates antigen-antibody complexes and therefore can introduce considerable inaccuracies in internalization experiments  <cit> . alternatively, antibodies can be biotinylated with nhs-ss-biotin and incubated with live cells. following specific reduction of biotin groups on cell surface bound antibody with reducing agent, the antibody internalization may be quantified by immunoblotting  <cit> . however, the accuracy of this method also relies on complete removal of biotin from the cell surface bound antibody. in addition, the stringent conditions that are required to strip the cell surface in these procedures may affect cell viability. another limitation of these methods is that they rely on laborious labeling of each candidate antibody, allowing only a limited number of unique antibodies to be screened for internalization. finally, the direct labeling of the antibody often results in loss of binding activity to the antigen. these considerable limitations adversely affect both the accuracy and throughput of presently available antibody selection methods and make it desirable to develop a new and more efficient process for screening internalizing antibodies. here we report about a novel assay for ligand or antibody internalization termed

"chelated ligand internalization assay" , based on a non-covalent attachment of 6-tagged ligands to a detectable label bearing a dissociative bond, such as ni-nta  chelation complex. the detectable label consisted of small unilamellar liposomes, thus permitting internalization of multiple reporter molecules in a single internalization event. the liposomes were formulated with ni-nta-lipids capable of binding 6-tagged proteins. the liposomes bearing ni-nta groups on their surface were loaded with fluorescent dye and mixed with a large pool of unique  <dig> containing anti-receptor antibody fragments or intact antibody complexed to 6-tagged protein a.

internalization of the ligand/liposome/receptor complex was detected by fluorescence microscopy or fluorimetry after gentle removal of cell surface bound complexes using edta. cellular uptake of the complex was dependent on the specificity of the scfv as well as the ability of the antibody fragment to trigger internalization, requiring <  <dig>  receptors/cell for detection. the assay required only small amounts  of antibody fragment and could be performed using crude, unpurified supernatants of e coli that expressed the antibody fragment.

it is also important to translate the observed internalization into cytotoxic readouts. to accomplish this, we used ni-nta-conjugated antibody in combination with drug-loaded liposomes to screen for target specific toxicity in breast cancer cells.

taken together, we describe a new and highly sensitive, selective and robust method for the screening of large arrays of antibodies  for specific internalizing ligands that can efficiently deliver agents to selected, receptor-antigen overexpressing cell types.

RESULTS
effect of 6-tagged internalizing ligands on the internalization of ni-nta liposomes into target cells
liposomes were formulated with the entrapped hydrophilic membrane-impermeable fluorescent marker  and various amounts of a ni-nta lipid . they were tested for internalization into erbb2- overexpressing skbr <dig> tumor cells via a highly internalizable anti-erbb <dig> scfv antibody   <cit>  engineered to contain a c-terminal 6-tag 6). following incubation of skbr <dig> cells with the liposomes and the antibody at 37°c, the free and surface-bound liposomes were removed by repeated rinsing with physiological buffer containing ni-chelating components . following a 4h incubation, cells were lysed in basic solution and as a measure of internalization of liposomes the hpts fluorescence was read in a microfluorimeter. as shown in fig. 1a, the absolute amounts of anti-erbb2-scfv-f5-6-ni-nta-liposome constructs internalized by skbr <dig> cells increased with increasing liposome concentration, and with increasing ni-nta-lipids in the liposome composition. the cellular uptake of the liposomes was approximately linearly proportional to the concentration of liposomes in the reaction between 0– <dig> μm phosholipid. because disintegration or leakage of the entrapped marker would result in substantial reduction or even disappearance of the fluorescent signal, these data also indicate that the ni-nta-bearing liposomes were stable enough in the cell culture medium to serve as efficient markers of internalization. because the dye hpts is highly charged and highly water soluble it is trapped in the liposome interior. the liposomes are also composed of a lipid composition that does not disintegrate in the presence of plasma  and thus the marker would not be expected to be released extracellularly.

the internalization of the liposomes was practically abolished when the added antibody did not contain a 6-tag , when the liposomes were formulated without ni-nta-containing lipid  <dig> ), when the 6-tagged antibody was omitted ), or when an irrelevant control scfv antibody 6) was used . thus, the mixing of an internalizable, 6-tagged protein ligand with ni-nta-bearing liposomes produced a non-covalent ligand-liposome construct internalizable in a ligand-dependent manner. moreover, a non-covalent bond between a 6-tagged ligand and a ni-nta chelating liposome was stable enough to allow the internalization of the construct by ligand-reactive cells under the cell culture conditions.

to expand the utility of the assay to full-length antibodies that do not originally contain a 6-tag, we prepared an adapter molecule that could link the ni-nta liposomes to the full-length antibodies. therefore, the antibody binding reagent protein a was conjugated to the peptide cggghhhhhh  using the bi-functional reagent sulfo-mbs which cross links the thiol group in the peptide to primary amines on protein a. sds-page analysis confirmed successful conjugation of multiple peptides per protein a molecule as demonstrated by an apparent shift in molecular weight of approximately  <dig> kda . when skbr <dig> cells were co-incubated with protein a- <dig> and the monoclonal anti-erbb <dig> antibody herceptin  in the presence of fluorescently labeled ni-nta-liposomes, the liposomes were specifically internalized as measured by fluorescence . protein a- <dig> or herceptin alone did not increase the uptake of ni-nta-liposomes, indicating that it is mediated by the herceptin/protein a- <dig> complex .

the internalized liposomes appear to localize to the endosomes as indicated by the apparent co-localization with fluorescently labeled transferrin and little or no liposomes remain at the cell surface following the edta or immidazole wash . the liposome uptake is temperature dependent and only little uptake is observed when the liposomes are incubated at  <dig> c .

effect of the antibody concentration: improving the sensitivity of the assay
the sensitivity of the assay was tested by incubating skbr <dig> cells  with  <dig> μm of the hpts-loaded liposomes containing 2% ni-nta  and varying concentrations of anti-erbb2-scfv-f5- <dig> . only increasing concentrations of the antibody resulted in the gradual increase of the liposome internalization of the complex. as expected, when the irrelevant anti-vegfr2- scfv-4g7- <dig> control antibody  was substituted for anti-erbb2-scfv-f5- <dig> it did not mediate internalization of the nta-liposomes above the blank samples containing no antibody . the detection limit of the assay with the anti-erbb2-scfv-f5- <dig> on skbr <dig> cells was about  <dig> ug/ml.

in an attempt to increase the sensitivity of the assay, we formulated ni-nta-liposomes with the following lipid matrix composition: popc,  <dig> molar parts; dogs-nta-ni,  <dig> molar parts; cholesterol,  <dig> molar parts; and peg-dspe,  <dig>  molar parts. higher concentration of dogs-nta-ni  was expected to increase the sensitivity, while inclusion of a pegylated lipid peg-dspe at low amount  was to reduce liposome aggregation and potentially increase the non-specific cell-liposome interactions due to increased ni-nta-lipid content. these liposomes were similarly tested on erbb2-overexpressing skbr <dig> cells  and on mcf- <dig> cells with low erbb <dig> expression .

following  <dig> hour incubation with the liposomes  in the cell growth media in the presence of  <dig> – <dig> μg/ml of anti-erbb2-scfv-f5- <dig>  the cells were washed  <dig> times with mg2+- and ca2+-containing hanks' bss . the amounts of cell-associated liposomes were compared in the samples after receiving two additional washes, either with mg2+- and ca2+-free hanks' bss , or with pbs containing  <dig> mm edta . the hpts fluorescence in alkaline lysates of the cells washed without edta reflected the totality of cell-internalized and surface-bound liposomes, while the fluorescence of the samples obtained after the edta wash was assumed to be proportional to the internalized liposome fraction .

in mcf- <dig> cells, the increasing amounts of anti-erbb2-scfv-f5- <dig> to  <dig> μg/ml resulted in an approximately 20% increase in the amount of cell-associated liposome marker over the background  control, which was not statistically significant . in skbr <dig> cells, the amount of cell-associated liposomes was still not significant at  <dig>  μg/ml of anti-erbb2-scfv-f5- <dig>  but at both  <dig> μg/ml and  <dig> μg/ml of anti-erbb2-scfv-f5- <dig>  there was a statistically significant  increase of the liposome uptake by skbr <dig> cells to 150–200% over the background. the fluorescence ratio between "+edta" and "-edta" samples indicated that 73–79% of the cell-associated liposome-antibody constructs were inaccessible to edta washing, i.e., internalized. this value was in good agreement with the previously determined degree of anti-erbb2-scfv-f5- <dig> internalization into skbr <dig> cells  using the traditional method of 125i-labeled antibody and acid wash  <cit> . thus, the improved liposome composition allowed an increase in the assay sensitivity to the equivalent of about  <dig> μg/ml of a single chain fv antibody.

clia does not require antibody purification
because of the specific interaction of the 6-tag with ni-nta on the liposome, we hypothesized that the assay would permit the use of unpurified scfv recombinant antibodies, even crude preparations such as bacterial lysates, hybridoma media or ascites fluid, allowing a large number of scfv antibody variants to be screened for internalization. to test this hypothesis, soluble scfv expression was induced from e. coli in 96-well culture plates and the supernatant tested for activity on live skbr <dig> cells using 5% fluorescently labeled ni-nta liposomes. in previous experiments  we have determined that skbr <dig> cells tolerate as much as  <dig> % bacterial culture supernatant for up to  <dig> h. bacterial supernatants from culture plates of e coli expressing the anti-erbb2-scfv-f5- <dig> were mixed 1: <dig>  with cell culture media containing  <dig> % serum, antibiotics, and  <dig> μm hpts-labeled ni-nta-liposomes . the mixture was subsequently incubated with live skbr <dig> cells. the amount of cell-internalized liposomes -measured by fluorescence- was similar to results obtained with  <dig> μg/ml of purified anti-erbb2-scfv-f5- <dig> and exhibited similar specificity . interestingly, the non-internalizing anti-erbb2-scfv-c <dig> - <dig> did not result in uptake of nta liposomes. this is consistent with previous results obtained by confocal microscopy analysis of the internalization of anti-erbb2-scfv-f5- <dig> and anti-erbb2-scfv-c <dig> - <dig>  <cit> . for some antigens , multimerization is known to induce internalization; however, this data suggests that this is not the case with nta lipomes bound to erbb <dig>  a 6-tagged egfr-specific internalizable single chain fv c <dig> 6)  <cit>  used as a control did not cause a noticeable internalization of the liposomes over the blank sample , consistent with the low amount of egf receptors expressed by skbr <dig> cells .

profiling tumor cell lines for antibody internalization
in addition to screening antibodies for internalization by a given cell line, the assay allowed screening of cell lines for their capacity to internalize a given antibody. as an example, anti-egfr-scfv-c10- <dig> was used to profile a panel of breast cancer cell lines and cho transfectants . only the cell line md-mda  <dig> and cho cells transfected with egfr internalized significant amounts of nta-liposomes. the specificity of the assay is exemplified by anti-egfr-scfv-c10- <dig> internalizing into cho cells transfected with egfr, but not untransfected cho cells. uptake of the fluorescent nta liposomes into the egfr transfected cho cells was  <dig> times that of untransfected cells .

the profile of anti-erbb2-scfv-f5- <dig> internalization largely correlated with cell surface expression of erbb <dig> as determined by flow cytometry with anti-erbb2-scfv-f5- <dig> . however, the cell line skov <dig> did not take up as many liposomes as would be expected from its cell surface expression level of erbb <dig>  the poor internalization of erbb <dig> into this cell line has been described previously  <cit> . when total uptake into the same panel of cell lines was determined using anti-erbb2-scfv-f5-liposomes  the discrepancy with anti-erbb2-scfv-f5- <dig> binding determined by flow cytometry was less pronounced. anti-erbb2-scfv-f5- <dig> linked covalently to the liposome surface is not removed by the edta washes used to disrupt the chelation of 6-tagged scfv to ni-nta chelating liposomes. this is most likely due to cell surface bound anti-erbb2-scfv-f5-6-liposomes. these results suggest that the dissociating bond between the detectable marker  and the antibody is required for an effective measurement of internalization.

cytotoxicity of targeted liposomal therapeutics
another potential application of the clia assay is the screening and characterization of target-specific cytotoxic activity of immunotargeted liposomal therapeutics. since different internalization pathways may lead to differences in cytotoxicity of the immunoliposome the ability to rapidly test combinations of targeting molecules and drug-loaded liposomes is of interest.

to test this application, we prepared fluorescently labeled liposomes containing dogs-nta-ni  and loaded them with the cytotoxic drugs vinorelbine, methotrexate, or doxorubicin. methotrexate was loaded passively and achieved a loading efficiency of approximately  <dig> %, equivalent to liposomes containing no dogs-nta-ni . doxorubicin and vinorelbine were loaded at the drug/phospholipid ratio of  <dig> mg/mmol using an ammonium sulfate gradient-based remote-loading method. this method typically results in loading efficiencies of 95– <dig> % for these drugs with neutral phospholipid liposomes. however, in the presence of dogs-nta-ni, the loading efficiency was reduced to about  <dig> % for doxorubicin and  <dig> % for vinorelbine. we hypothesized that the reduced loading resulted from an interaction of the amphipathic drugs with the nta-ni functionality located at the membrane surface. unexpectedly, the high loading efficiency  was restored when a different nta-ni-lipid derivative, dspe-peg-nta-ni , was substituted for dogs-nta-ni . liposomes with dspe-peg-nta-ni instead of dogs-nta-ni reached a loading efficiency of 92– <dig> %, similar to that seen with nonchelating liposomes. these results suggest that extending the nta-ni chelating group away from the membrane surface will be important for forming liposomes where the drug is loaded via remote-loading methodology, or where the drug either transiently or permanently resides in the membrane.

1doxorubicin , vinorelbine , and methotrexate  were quantitated by absorbance at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> nm, respectively, following dissolution of the liposome sample in acid isopropanol.

2phospholipid was determined by phosphate analysis as described by bartlett, 1959

3free drug was removed by sephadex g- <dig> gel filtration chromatography.

cytotoxicity studies with liposomal doxorubicin demonstrate target specific activity for liposomes in the presence of  <dig> μg/ml anti-erbb2-scfv-f5- <dig> . the cytotoxicity of dspe-peg-nta-ni-liposomes containing doxorubicin  increased 26-fold in skbr <dig> cells, but not of liposomes prepared with dogs-nta-ni . the difference in the ic <dig> between targeted and nontargeted liposomal doxorubicin in the peg-linked construct was 26-fold,  <dig>  vs.  <dig>  μg/ml, respectively. the ic <dig> for the free drug  was  <dig>  μg/ml . the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin-loaded dogs-ni-nta-containing liposomes did not change in the presence of anti-erbb2-scfv-f5- <dig>  which likely reflects the higher drug leakage rate from these liposomes, consistent with their decreased drug-loading efficiency. thus, accurate screening of antibodies for target-specific activity using liposomal drug constructs significantly benefited from using a pegylated lipid that may act as a spacer to move the chelating group away from the membrane surface, at least when amphipathic drugs such as doxorubicin are employed. the peg spacer also provides the potential for insertion of the chelating lipid into the outer monolayer of drug-loaded or fluorescentlylabeled liposomes, thus transforming a nontargeted liposome into a targeted one upon addition of 6-containing scfvs.

discussion
antigen-specific antibody fragments can be directly selected using phage display libraries where the fragments are displayed on the surface of filamentous bacteriophages  <cit> . these libraries can generate panels of unique scfv antibodies with varying binding affinities to virtually any antigen  <cit> . the selected antibody fragments can be used for a wide variety of therapeutic applications, including directly altering normal antigen function  <cit>  and targeted delivery of radioisotopes, toxins  <cit> , small molecule drugs, liposomal drugs  <cit> , and direct effector cells to tumor sites  <cit> . the activity of many of these immunotargeted therapies, including immunotargeted nanocarriers for nucleic acids  <cit> , immunoliposomes  <cit> , and immunotoxins  <cit> , often rely on intracellular delivery for optimal activity. internalization of the immunoliposomal drugs is thought to result in intracellular release of the drug from the carrier, a more uniform intratumoral distribution, and decreased diffusion of the drug from the therapeutic targets  <cit> . thus, the preferential selection and characterization of internalizing ligands would aid in the development of certain therapeutics that depend on internalization for "activation" and thus optimal in vivo efficacy.

a wide variety of methods have been described for selecting antigen-specific antibodies from phage display libraries, most often related directly to antigen binding  <cit> . selection can be to antigen coated on plates, on column matrices, cells displaying the antigen, or to antigen in solution followed by capture onto a solid support. alternatively, phage display libraries can be screened for antibodies that elicit a particular response, such as internalization  <cit> . using this method, a series of unique and internalizing anti-erbb <dig>  <cit>  and anti-egfr  <cit>  scfv antibodies have been identified and are currently being utilized in our laboratories for the development of targeted therapeutics  <cit>  but the method is limited in scope because it does not allow quantitation of internalization nor does it characterize antibody internalization into multiple cell lines.

due to the increasing need for identification of internalizing ligands for therapeutic or diagnostic applications, the development of sensitive and accurate methods for screening or characterizing antibodies for internalizing capabilities is essential. current methods are filled with inaccuracies, often due to incomplete removal of surface bound ligand  <cit> . other limitations involve loss of binding activity upon ligand labeling, inefficient labeling, or poor sensitivity.

here we have described the development of a novel assay that uses histidine-tagged antibody fragments bound to ni-nta-lipid anchored liposomes encapsulating a membrane impermeable fluorophore to monitor cellular internalization. we call this method "chelated ligand internalization assay", or clia. the use of ni2+-chelates to bind 6-tagged proteins has been commonly employed in the purification of recombinant proteins  <cit> . indeed, we often use this methodology for purification of selected scfvs, to be used in different targeted therapeutic and diagnostic applications. chelating lipids, most commonly lipid-modified derivatives of nitrioltriacetic acid, have been used to study receptor-ligand interactions in model membranes  <cit> , for two-dimensional crystallization of histidinetagged proteins  <cit> , for capturing modified peptides on membranes for western blot analysis  <cit>  or for reversible binding of proteins to membranes  <cit> . they have also been used in early studies of potential therapeutic approaches, including attaching costimulatory molecules to membrane vesicles for tumor immunotherapy  <cit>  or modification of liposomes with various ligands such as an anti-her <dig> peptide  <cit> .

because internalization can be significantly affected by the size and valency of ligand display for the internalizing conjugate, the method described here can not be generalized to conjugates of widely variable sizes and/or degrees of ligand display. the multivalent display of receptor ligands or antibodies specific for cell-surface receptors can dramatically increase avidity for its receptor compared to the corresponding monovalent ligand  <cit> , result in cross-linking of cell surface receptors  <cit> , and have an effect on the efficiency of internalization into cells  <cit> . indeed we have observed an increased internalization efficiency when scfv are displayed multivalently on the surface of phage  <cit> . however, conjugate binding and internalization may also reach a plateau at a certain valency and then decrease in efficiency at higher valencies  <cit> . finally, multivalent display of ligands can affect the intracellular trafficking of the ligand or ligand-conjugate  <cit> .

the size of the conjugate may also play a role in determining the efficiency of internalization. the optimum diameter for spherical particles with respect to internalization appears to be in the range of 50– <dig> nm  <cit> . however, particles up to  <dig> nm can be readily taken up into nonphagocytic eukaryotic cells, with increasing size from 50– <dig> nm giving rise to a reduced efficiency of internalization, and particles of higher size being taken up by a distinct mechanism   <cit> . ligand-targeted liposomes are typically prepared in the optimum range of 80– <dig> nm due to the reduced clearance of small relative to large particles in vivo, and the inherent instabilities observed in drug encapsulation at very small sizes where a high radius of curvature can result in increased membrane permeability to encapsulated agents  <cit> .

in this manuscript we describe a method for characterizing and screening multivalently displayed ligands using scfv fragments conjugated noncovalently to the surface of liposomes through a hexahistidine tag in the c-terminus of the scfv. the liposomes have been designed to minimize leakage or disassociation of the fluorescence probe from the carrier. hpts is a highly charged and water soluble aqueous contents marker that is stably retained in the liposomal interior  <cit>  and has been widely utilized in the liposome field to characterize the interactions of liposomes with cells, specifically with respect to internalization  <cit> . great care must be chosen in the choice of probe. some lipid-soluble fluorescent dyes are readily extractable by plasma proteins or cellular membranes while some fluorescent aqueous contents markers  can rapidly leak from the liposome at the low ph experienced during internalization due to protonation of the flurophores carboxyl groups  <cit> . indeed, the later studies with encapsulated cytotoxic agents illustrate this point, as doxorubicin encapsulated in a less stable formulation gives rise to nonspecific cytotoxicity .

the final studies in this manuscript describe a modification of the initial clia method for characterizing the cytotoxicity of ligand-targeted immunoliposomal therapeutics. because the main purpose of the methodology is to identify suitable therapeutic targeting molecules, it is necessary to screen various targeting ligands for their ability to elicit the desired effect. although internalization is generally known to be required for a substantial improvement in antitumor activity, it is important to understand that different targeting ligands and different receptors may traffic to very different intracellular pathways thus resulting in differences in cytotoxic activity for the delivered drug that depend on the targeting ligand employed. we have recently observed in the same cell line, cytotoxic activity that varied from 20– <dig> fold between immunoliposomes prepared using two different scfv targeting ligands, despite the fact that they resulted in similar levels of internalized liposomes . although it is possible to proceed directly to screening for cytotoxicity, this screening is considerably more cumbersome due to the fact that a series of dilutions is required to accurately determine the mtd for the drug. it is thus more desirable to reduce the number of scfv antibodies to be screened for targeted cytotoxicity based on the results of the more high throughput clia assay. however, in order to accurately screen for differences in cytotoxic activity it was necessary to modify the liposome construct to include a ni2+ chelate that was sufficiently removed from the surface of the carrier so as not to interfere with drug encapsulation, or subsequent stability during the course of the assay.

CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge, this is the first study to use this coupling methodology as a tool to quantitate receptor-mediated internalization by taking advantage of the reversible nature of the noncovalent ni- <dig> linkage. we have found that 6-tagged scfvs bind to liposomes containing these modified lipids and give sensitive reporting of receptor-mediated internalization and target-specific cytotoxic activity. in this work, we have also described the synthesis of a new ni-nta-lipid chelate, dspe-peg-nta-ni, containing a poly linker for preparing stable liposomal drug constructs with the capability of rapidly binding his-tagged proteins. the low amount of antibody required and the robust nature of the assay allow for high throughput screening of internalizing ligands. in addition, the application of this assay to cytotoxicity assessments allows us to directly screen antibodies for the target-specific activity that is often the ultimate goal of an application for these molecules. we believe this technology will prove invaluable for the rapid discovery and development of targeting ligands against novel therapeutic targets.
