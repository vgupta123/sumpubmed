BACKGROUND
the biological sciences have been embracing a new paradigm as a result of accruing genome information  <cit> . however, all previously reported eukaryotic nuclear genome sequences have been incomplete, especially in highly repeated units and chromosomal ends. because repetitive dna is essential to genome function  <cit> , and may contribute to the diversity of isoforms  <cit>  and the evolution of life  <cit> , complete chromosomal structures are fundamental for understanding eukaryotic cells.

our recently published nuclear-genome sequence of the ultra-small, hot-spring red alga, cyanidioschyzon merolae 10d, revealed some unique features, such as very few introns, only three copies of ribosomal dna, and a small total number of genes  <cit> . however, because uncertainties remained regarding the features of certain important repeated elements, such as histone-gene clusters and telomeres  <cit> , this sequence, like all previous eukaryotic nuclear-genome sequences, was incomplete. given the functional significance of such elements  <cit> , it was obviously desirable to complete the sequence and resolve all ambiguities before attempting to summarize all of the unique features of the c. merolae genome. therefore, we aimed to complete all previous gaps and sequenced all the remaining chromosomal ends, to construct the first nuclear genome sequence that is 100% complete. the results demonstrated that c. merolae possesses the simplest nuclear genome known among non-symbiotic eukaryotes.

RESULTS
a 100%-complete genome sequence
completing the nuclear genome sequence, from telomere to telomere, without gaps or ambiguities, required two distinct subprojects:  filling in all  <dig> previously existing gaps between contigs, and  sequencing the  <dig>  chromosome ends that had not been sequenced previously by the shotgun method  <cit> . using pcr with sequence-specific primers to amplify portions of the c. merolae bacterial artificial chromosomes  that contained gap regions of interest, and then sequencing the resulting subclones, we have reduced the number of gaps between contigs from  <dig> to zero . a variety of methods  were then used to sequence all of the chromosomal ends that had not been sequenced previously . the global size of the  <dig> gaps that we have sequenced in this study is  <dig>  <dig> base pairs. these sequences are g+c-rich  compared with that of the whole nuclear genome , and six of the  <dig> have extremely high g+c contents . furthermore, sequences corresponding to  <dig> previous gaps have extremely high nucleotide identity  to other genomic regions. it turns out that the nuclear genomic sequence previously reported  <cit>  contains misassembled and/or incorrect sequences of > <dig> kbp in total. the resulting complete genome sequence contains  <dig> base pairs and covers 100% of the chromosomal genome, from telomere to telomere. the numbers of base pairs in each of the  <dig> nuclear chromosomes are given in table  <dig>  these  <dig> linear nuclear chromosomes plus the two circular organellar dna molecules  <cit>  comprise the entire genome of the organism, and contain  <dig> base pairs .

histone-gene cluster
the total number of histone genes varies greatly by species. animal genomes typically have several hundred to several thousand histone genes organized as a set of tandemly repeating quintets of the five major histone gene types  <cit> . in contrast, histone genes are located on more than one chromosome in some organisms, such as the ultra-small green alga ostreococcus  <cit>  and the flowering plant arabidopsis  <cit> . in our previous study, the complete organization of the histone cluster area in the c. merolae genome was left unresolved, because of several gaps within this region of sequence  <cit> . however, our present complete sequence establishes that all c. merolae histone genes are localized on chromosome  <dig> and form a small cluster  that includes two copies of the three core histone genes , three copies of the h <dig> gene, and a single copy of the linker-histone h <dig> gene . in saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> , schizosaccharomyces pombe  <cit> , dictyostelium discoideum  <cit> , encephalitozoon cuniculi  <cit>  and ostreococcus tauri  <cit>  the histone genes also exhibit small copy numbers , as in c. merolae, but they are dispersed across more than two chromosomes. thus, the c. merolae histone genes are present in the most compact cluster yet described.

telomeres and subtelomeric regions
whole-genome shotgun sequencing suggested that the repeat unit in c. merolae telomeres is aatgggggg  <cit> , but in that study only six of the  <dig> chromosome ends were examined  <cit>  . here the sequencing of all remaining termini confirmed that aatgggggg is the telomere repeat sequence in all c. merolae chromosomal ends. in most plants, the telomeres are composed of many copies of the sequence tttaggg  <cit> , and the c. merolae telomere sequence, aatgggggg, has never yet been found elsewhere.

telomere length varies among plants from approximately  <dig>  kbp in the green alga chlorella vulgaris to  <dig> kbp in tobacco  <cit> . telomere restriction fragment analyses using the  <dig> probe revealed aatgggggg repeats varying from  <dig> to  <dig> bp in the total chromosomal ends in the c. merolae genome . our southern blot analysis using a specific genomic probe suggested that c. merolae chromosome  <dig> has around a 400-bp telomere repeat sequence at the left end . however, the longest telomeric repeats that could be sequenced in this study were  <dig>  repeats  in the right end of chromosome  <dig>  possibly because long stretches of aatgggggg repeats are difficult to clone or sequence using conventional techniques used in this and previous studies  <cit> .

the putative telomerase catalytic subunit, telomerase reverse transcriptase  is transcribed  in c. merolae  <cit> . in the c. merolae genome, we found two possible telomerase rna subunit genes in chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  based on two transcripts, cmm123t and cmp131t, which included uuccccccauu and ccauuccccccauu sequences, respectively. the telomerase rna template sequence  has been detected in only these two hypothetical non-coding rna genes among all the predicted genes in the present 100% complete nuclear genome. these are the first convincing candidate telomerase-rna subunit genes in plant and algal lineages.

based on the end sequencing of all  <dig> chromosomal termini completed here, all of the subtelomeric regions in the c. merolae nuclear genome have been unveiled . eight types of homologous dna elements , with unique gene contents, were found adjacent to the telomere repeats in the  <dig> chromosomal ends . two of the eight types exist in only two ends; element h for 3l  and 16r, and element l for 3r and 11r. ph elements are the most frequent and are recognized in 6l, 7r, 8l, 8r, 11l, 14r, 18r and 19r, whereas nine termini  showed no homology to other terminal regions. this situation is different from that of s. cerevisiae, in which core x elements exist in all chromosomal ends  <cit> . in the ultrasmall, obligate intracellular parasite e. cuniculi   <cit>  and the nucleomorphs  of the cryptophyte guillardia theta and chlorarachniophyte bigelowiella natans  <cit> , both of the subtelomeric regions of all chromosomes harbor rrna genes. however, such features are not recognized in cyanidioschyzon  and the ultra-small green ostreococcus  <cit> , and thus seem to represent some evolutionary convergence resulting from the intracellular parasitism or endosymbiosis in e. cuniculi and the nucleomorphs.

transposable elements
the number of transposable elements in various eukaryotes differs widely  <cit> , and of all the non-symbiotic and non-pathogenic eukaryotes previously studied, yeast and pufferfish have the fewest: about 3% of the genome  <cit> . however, transposons constitute only about  <dig> % of the c. merolae genome . the completed c. merolae genome sequence contains only  <dig> class i elements  and eight class ii elements   <cit>  . the transcripts of three of the  <dig> retrotransposons contained an intact reverse transcriptase open-reading frame, and a blastx search suggested that all  <dig> of the retrotransposons were most closely related to non-long terminal repeat  retrotransposons. so, although ltr retrotransposons are widely distributed in plants and animals  <cit> , we could not find any of them in the c. merolae genome. all eight of the transposase-related elements of c. merolae were most closely related  to transposase sequences of bacterial transposons. in short, c. merolae is one of the two non-symbiotic eukaryotes with an extremely low abundance of transposable elements . in the endosymbiotic reduced eukaryotes, encephalitozoon cuniculi and nucleomorphs  <cit> , however, transposable elements seem lacking in chromosomes.

bold type indicates the smallest number in non-symbiotic eukaryotes.

two non-symbiotic eukaryotes, schizosaccharomyces pombe and the filamentous fungus ashbya gossypii, have nuclear protein-coding genes that are as small in number as those of c. merolae.

the number of protein-coding genes in the nuclear genome of s. pombe  <cit>  increased to  <dig> .

although a. gossypii was reported to contain  <dig> protein-coding nuclear genes  <cit> , the genome project of this fungus is now in progress ; thus it possibly contains more than  <dig> protein-coding genes.

in contrast to this,  <dig> copies of a novel interspersed repetitive element were found in the c. merolae genome. all copies have a truncated orf that is weakly related  to a putative protein, wsv <dig>  that is encoded in the genome of the shrimp spot syndrome virus  <cit> . these repetitive elements have an average size of  <dig>  kbp, are distributed randomly on all chromosomes, and altogether comprise about 5% of the genome. because these elements exhibit transcriptional activity  <cit> , they may contribute to genomic or cellular functions in c. merolae in the same manner as repetitive dna does in other eukaryotes  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the smallest known histone-gene cluster, a unique telomeric repeat, a very low density of transposable elements, and other previously described simple features of the c. merolae nuclear genome  <cit>   are very distinctive, and constitute the simplest set of genomic features found in any non-symbiotic eukaryote yet studied. such simple features are generally considered to result from consequences of reductive evolution of an ultra-small eukaryote  <cit> . however, none of these features is shared by the similarly ultra-small green alga, ostreococcus, in which 39% of the genes contain introns, histone genes are dispersed across at least six chromosomes, and  <dig> transposable elements and  <dig> protein-coding genes are distributed among the chromosomes  <cit>  . these may suggest differences in modes of genome reduction between ancestors of cyanidioschyzon  and ostreococcus . on the other hand, algae living in acidic hot springs  might be candidates for retaining ancient plant attributes, because the volcano activity is thought to have been providing such an extreme environment throughout earth's history. very recently, cunningham et al  <cit>  reported that c. merolae contains perhaps the simplest assortment of chlorophylls and carotenoids found in any eukaryotic photosynthetic organism. in addition, the c. merolae plastid genome contains a large number of genes, which is thought to be a primitive feature, because reversal of plastid-gene loss is generally considered to be impossible  <cit> . thus, our hypothesis is that some of the unusual or simple genomic characteristics of c. merolae may represent primitive features that have been conserved in cyanidioschyzon, but have become extensively modified during the evolution of other plant lineages. alternatively, the unique genomic features of c. merolae  may reflect adaptation to the extreme environment. however, genome information for other hot-spring red algae is very limited. the recently released nuclear genome sequence of another hot-spring red alga galdieria has not revealed the chromosomal structures of its components, such as rdna units or histone cluster area.  <cit> . further information on the complete nuclear genomes of other plants, including other hot-spring red algae, red macro-algae, and other members of plant and algal lineages, will be needed to determine whether c. merolae actually has primitive genomic features.

three kinds of genomes are found in many eukaryotic cells: nuclear, mitochondrial, and plastid  <cit> . based on the present nuclear genome data and the previously published mitochondrial and plastid genome sequences  <cit> , all major types of eukaryotic genetic information are present in c. merolae. in addition, as revealed by the present 100% complete genome, c. merolae contains unusually simple sets of genes and sequences . for example, because almost all protein-coding nuclear genes of c. merolae lack introns , the complete sequence of the genome provided here can be used directly to deduce the sequences of all of its proteins, which will make it extremely valuable for future proteomics research. therefore, c. merolae represents an ideal model organism for studying the fundamental relationships among the chloroplast, mitochondrial and nuclear of genomes. the complete nuclear genome sequence reported here will greatly improve the precision of biological analyses of c. merolae, including studies of chromosome structure and gene structure/annotation. furthermore, because c. merolae inhabits hot springs   <cit> , most of its proteins must be unusually heat-stable, and so its proteome may well provide important new insights into the structural basis for heat stability of proteins.
