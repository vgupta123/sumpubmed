BACKGROUND
pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram negative opportunistic pathogen with an extraordinary capacity to survive in, and adapt to, a wide range of environmental niches. genome size  and plasticity enable the expression of an arsenal of surface-associated and secreted virulence factors  <cit> , which contribute to nosocomially-acquired p. aeruginosa infections, particularly those involving burns and wounds, as well as meningitis, endocarditis and microbial keratitis. p. aeruginosa is also the major determinant of morbidity and mortality in patients suffering from the autosomal recessive disorder cystic fibrosis   <cit> . cf patients display electrolyte transport imbalance and dysfunction across many organ systems. in the lungs, this is characterized by the production of a thickened dehydrated mucus layer, which provides an environment suitable for colonization by pathogens  <cit> . although many species are able to colonize the cf lung, including staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae, p. aeruginosa will eventually dominate in the majority of patients. initial p. aeruginosa infections may be cleared by antibiotics, however biofilm formation allows persistence that is associated with antibiotic resistance and chronic infection  <cit> . strains of p. aeruginosa associated with cf infections are likely to contain and/or express genes that confer functional traits allowing initial colonization of the cf lung mucosa as well as the ability to out-compete other pathogens.

contrary to the dogma that cf patients acquire unique p. aeruginosa from an environmental source  <cit> , it has now become evident that person-to-person transmissible strains may circulate within cf clinics  <cit> . such strains have been found in the united kingdom and europe , as well as canada  <cit>  and australia . increasing evidence suggests that transmission between patients occurs via a cough-associated aerosol route  <cit> . the majority of epidemic strains display evidence of increased virulence in cf patients  <cit>  and transmission to patients with non-cf bronchiectasis, or even otherwise healthy relatives, has been detected  <cit> . little is known however, about the mechanisms underlying transmissibility and pathogenesis of epidemic p. aeruginosa. isolates from initial infection tend to be non-mucoid and motile, but over time the organism undergoes genotypic and phenotypic changes that promote persistence, including conversion to mucoidy, loss of motility and reduced type iii secretion consistent with biofilm formation  <cit> . whole genome sequencing of two clonally related isolates collected from a cf patient  <dig>  years apart  <cit>   showed loss of function in virulence genes required for o-antigen biosynthesis, type iii secretion, twitching motility, exotoxin a regulation, multi-drug efflux, phenazine biosynthesis, quorum sensing  and iron acquisition.

horizontal gene transfer and recombination in gene islands, large chromosomal inversions and gene loss are important in p. aeruginosa evolution  <cit> , and phenotypic traits may also be acquired from infecting bacteriophage. p. aeruginosa clone c carries a plasmid and genomic islands with sequences substantially different from the p. aeruginosa reference clone pao <dig> that may confer enhanced colonization and survival  <cit> . adaptation by p. aeruginosa to the cf lung is also accelerated by the host immune response and nutrient limitation, including oxidative stress and iron availability, as well as antibiotic challenge. while the clone c, aes- <dig>  les and ma epidemic strains do not appear closely related to each other  <cit> , a shared phenotype is the expression of biofilm-associated genes. analysis of cf isolates show increased expression of qs, bacteriophage and other genes that are indicative of iron limited, stationary phase, and oxygen-limited growth  <cit>  and many of these correlate with in vivo transcriptome analysis  <cit> . despite the accumulation of evidence regarding gene expression during infection, the molecular basis for transmissibility is almost completely unknown.

in this study, we employed a complementary proteomic approach involving two-dimensional gel electrophoresis  and two-dimensional liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry  with isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation  to determine protein abundance differences between the reference strain p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  the virulent burn/wound isolate ucbpp-pa <dig>  and the early, transmissible cf-associated p. aeruginosa aes-1r. we identified over  <dig> proteins of which  <dig> were present at statistically significant altered abundance between strains. this study identified  <dig> previously hypothetical proteins only expressed in strain aes-1r, of which aes_ <dig> was the most abundant protein detected on 2-de gels. other proteins present at elevated abundance in aes-1r compared to pa <dig> and pao <dig> included several secreted and iron acquisition proteins, such as those associated with pyochelin synthesis and binding. aes-1r displayed an absence or decreased abundance of a number of porins including opre, oprg and oprd, but elevated abundance of the multi-drug efflux protein mexx, part of the mexxy-oprm tripartite efflux pump. aes-1r also displayed differential abundance of proteins involved in lipopolysaccharide and fatty acid biosynthesis. these data suggest that aes-1r expresses specific proteins and regulates the abundance of proteins shared with other p. aeruginosa strains to influence transmissibility and colonization of the cf lung.

methods
bacterial strains and growth conditions
p. aeruginosa pao <dig> is a laboratory reference strain originally isolated from an infected burn/wound of a patient in melbourne, australia , strain pa <dig>  was obtained from dr. laurence rahme, harvard medical school, cambridge, ma  <cit>  and aes-1r was obtained from prof. david armstrong, monash medical centre, australia  <cit> . strains were cultured in six replicates of  <dig> ml of salt modified luria-bertani broth  and grown to stationary phase  with incubation at 37°c and shaking at  <dig> × rpm . cultures were harvested, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and cells collected by centrifugation at  <dig>  × g for  <dig> mins at 4°c. the resulting bacterial cell pellets were frozen, lyophilized and stored at -80°c.

phenotypic assays
phenotypic assays on p. aeruginosa aes-1r, pao <dig> and pa <dig> were conducted using standard methodologies. briefly, mucoidy  and colony size were assessed by growth on columbia horse blood agar  and mueller-hinton  agar. pyocyanin production was scored against colour standards from overnight lb broth cultures grown at 37°c. for pyoverdine production,  <dig> μl of overnight lb culture was spotted on to a king's b agar plate, allowed to dry and incubated for  <dig> h at 37°c, and assayed based on the zone of pigmentation around the colony. rhamnolipid, phospholipase c , haemolysin, total protease and elastase assays were conducted using  <dig> μl each of overnight lb culture spotted onto agar as follows: i) rhamnolipid, m <dig> agar; ii) plc, egg yolk agar ; iii) haemolysin, columbia horse blood agar; iv) total protease,  <dig> ml skim milk agar; and v) elastase,  <dig> ml elastin agar. each assay was incubated for 24- <dig> h at 37°c and the diameters of clearing zones measured. each assay was conducted in at least triplicate. biofilm forming properties were measured using a 1: <dig> dilution of an overnight lb broth culture in fresh lb medium.  <dig> μl was added to each well of a flat bottom microtest tissue culture plate  and incubated in a moist environment at 37°c for  <dig> h. wells were stained with  <dig> μl  <dig> % crystal violet for  <dig> h before dissolving in  <dig> μl 20%  acetone. absorbance was then read at  <dig> nm. swimming motility was assayed by spotting a single colony onto a  <dig> % lb agar plate and incubating for  <dig> h at 37°c. twitching motility was assayed by stabbing a colony into the bottom of a  <dig> ml 1% lb agar plate and incubating for  <dig> h at 37°c. in both cases motility was measured by the diameter of the resulting growth zones.

preparation of protein extracts for 2-de
proteins were extracted from  <dig> mg of lyophilized bacterial cell pellets in  <dig> ml  <dig> mm tris  by tip-probe sonication  using  <dig> cycles of  <dig> s with resting on ice between cycles. nucleic acids were removed by incubation with  <dig> u endonuclease  for  <dig> mins at room temperature. lysates were then centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for  <dig> mins at 15°c to remove insoluble material. resulting supernatants were methanol precipitated overnight at -80°c and the proteins collected by centrifugation at  <dig>  × g for  <dig> mins at 4°c. proteins were then resuspended in  <dig> ml of 2-de buffer .

separation of proteins by 2-de
proteins  were loaded onto  <dig> cm ph 4- <dig> immobilized ph gradient  strips  by overnight passive rehydration. isoelectric focussing was carried out using a bio-rad ief cell for a total of  <dig> kvh. proteins in ipg strips were detergent exchanged, reduced and alkylated in  <dig> m urea, 2%  sds, 20%  glycerol,  <dig> mm tbp,  <dig> %  acrylamide monomer and  <dig> mm tris-hcl  for  <dig> mins. strips were then embedded on an 8-18%t gradient sds-page gel using  <dig> %  agarose in  <dig> mm tris,  <dig> mm glycine,  <dig> %  sds. proteins were separated in a dodeca cell  at 16°c at  <dig> v constant voltage for  <dig> mins followed by  <dig> v for  <dig> h. gels were fixed in 40%  methanol, 10%  acetic acid for  <dig> h and then stained overnight in sypro ruby . gels were destained in 10%  methanol, 7%  acetic acid for  <dig> h and imaged using a molecular imager fx . gels were 'double-stained' for a minimum of  <dig> h in colloidal coomassie blue g- <dig>  g- <dig> in 17%  ammonium sulphate, 34%  methanol and 3%  ortho-phosphoric acid). gels were destained in 1%  acetic acid for a minimum of  <dig> h.

changes in protein abundance were compared for 2-de gels generated from each strain using the program pd-quest . since the x,y-coordinates of spots on 2-de gels from different bacterial isolates are not always identical due to minor amino acid sequence variations that lead to altered electrophoretic migration, we undertook a protein mapping exercise to identify like proteins across isolates, as well as image-based comparisons. spots between isolates corresponding to the same protein identifications were detected using pd-quest and the relative spot intensities  calculated. statistical analyses were performed on six replicate 2-de gels corresponding to two gels from each of three separate biological preparations. the cut-off for significance was an n-fold change in mean spot abundance of less than  <dig>  or greater than  <dig>  with a p-value less than  <dig> , or spots with a ratio less than  <dig>  or greater than  <dig>  with a p-value less than  <dig> . mean spot density values were calculated for each spot across replicate gels and standard error of the mean  determined. spots absent from a given strain were denoted as not detected , while those only present in that strain were labeled . if the sem was greater than 15% of the calculated mean, the spot was not investigated further. students' t-test was performed on the normalized spot intensities, with significance levels set at  <dig> .

protein identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry  peptide mass mapping
spots were destained in a 60: <dig> solution of  <dig> mm nh4hco <dig> /100% acetonitrile  for  <dig> h. gel pieces were vacuum-dried for  <dig> h and rehydrated in  <dig> μl of  <dig> ng/μl of trypsin at 4°c for  <dig> h. excess trypsin was removed and gel pieces re-suspended in  <dig> μl of  <dig> mm nh4hco <dig> and incubated overnight at 37°c. peptides were concentrated and desalted using c <dig> zip-tips  and eluted in matrix ,  <dig> mg/ml in 70%  mecn/1%  formic acid ) directly onto a target plate. peptide mass maps were generated by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry  using a qstar elite mass spectrometer  equipped with o-maldi source. spectra were examined in analyst v <dig>   and mass calibration performed prior to data acquisition using external calibration with the sequazyme™ peptide mass standard kit . peak lists from each spot were generated by manual interrogation of the spectra. data from peptide mass maps were used to perform searches of a composite p. aeruginosa database composed of translated genome sequences from pao <dig> , pa <dig>  and aes-1r  via an in-house mascot server . identification parameters included peptide mass accuracy within  <dig>  da, one possible missed tryptic cleavage per peptide and with the methionine sulfoxide and cysteine-acrylamide modifications checked. identifications were based on mascot score, observed pi and mass , number of matching peptide masses and total percentage of the amino acid sequence that those peptides covered.

where insufficient data were obtained for a confident identification using peptide mass mapping, reversed phase liquid chromatography coupled to tandem ms  with de novo sequencing of peptides was performed. protein spots were digested as above and the peptides concentrated and desalted using a column packed with poros r <dig> resin  <cit> . columns were primed with 97% mecn, acidified with  <dig> % trifluoroacetic acid , and the digested peptides loaded. bound peptides were washed twice with  <dig> % tfa and eluted with 70% mecn/ <dig> % tfa. eluted peptides were dried by vacuum centrifugation and resuspended in  <dig> % fa. peptides were separated using an automated agilent  <dig> nanoflow lc system coupled to an applied biosystems q-star elite mass spectrometer for ms/ms sequencing. peptides were eluted over  <dig> mins using a gradient of 5-60% buffer b  at a nanoflow rate of  <dig> nl/min. ms survey scans were performed over the m/z range of 400- <dig> , followed by three data-dependent ms/ms scans. data were analyzed using analyst and the resulting ms/ms data were searched against the aforementioned p. aeruginosa database using mascot with the following parameters; allow  <dig> missed cleavage, precursor mass tolerance  <dig>  da, fragment ion mass tolerance  <dig>  da, with methionine sulfoxide, cysteine-acrylamide, and carbamidomethylation variable modifications selected.

quantitative proteomics using itraq and two-dimensional liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry 
proteins were extracted from  <dig> mg of lyophilized bacteria in  <dig> ml  <dig> %  sds by tip-probe sonication as described above. proteins were precipitated from the cell lysate by methanol/chloroform as per  <cit>  and collected by centrifugation at  <dig> × g for  <dig> mins. the resulting supernatant was removed and the pellet washed  <dig> times with  <dig> ml ice-cold methanol. protein pellets were resuspended in  <dig>  m triethylammonium bicarbonate / <dig> %  sds. proteins from each of the p. aeruginosa isolates were then labelled with isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation .  <dig> μg of each protein sample was reduced with  <dig> mm tris 2-carboxyethyl phosphine  at 60°c for  <dig> h, then alkylated with  <dig> mm methyl methyl sulfoxide  at room temperature for  <dig> mins, followed by digestion with trypsin  at 37°c overnight. digested protein samples were dried by vacuum centrifugation and resuspended in  <dig>  m teab. duplicate 4-plex itraq experiments were conducted with the following labelling of samples: p. aeruginosa pao <dig> , p. aeruginosa pa <dig> , p. aeruginosa aes-1r , and a biological replicate of p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  in the first experiment and aes-1r in the second. samples were labelled according to the manufacturer's instructions. briefly, itraq labels were resuspended in  <dig> μl ethanol and added to the appropriate protein sample. labelling was conducted at room temperature for  <dig> h, and the reaction quenched with  <dig> μl ultra-pure water. labelling efficiency was tested by pooling  <dig> μl aliquots of all labelled samples, desalting peptides as described above, and then acquiring maldi tof-tof ms/ms data on a  <dig> mass spectrometer . all samples showed a 1:1:1: <dig> labelling efficiency. labelled samples were pooled, dried to near completion by vacuum centrifugation and resuspended in  <dig> mm phosphate buffer/25%  mecn .

labelled peptides were then separated by two-dimensional liquid chromatography  and identified by ms/ms. peptides were fractionated by strong cation exchange  chromatography using an agilent  <dig> hplc with a polylc  polysulfoethyl a  <dig> mm ×  <dig>  mm  <dig> μm  <dig> Å column. peptides were loaded and washed in buffer a . fractions were then collected at 2- <dig> min intervals during an  <dig> mins gradient from 10% to 45% buffer b  over  <dig> mins and then, following a rapid increase, to 100% buffer b for  <dig> mins at a flow rate of  <dig> μl/min. scx fractions were vacuum concentrated and resuspended in  <dig> μl of  <dig> %  tfa/2%  mecn. a tempo nanolc  and q-star elite mass spectrometer  were used for nanolc electrospray ionisation ms-ms. a  <dig> μl aliquot of the resuspended sample was loaded on a reverse phase captrap  column and desalted at  <dig> μl per min for  <dig> mins. after desalting, the trap was switched on-line and peptides separated by reversed phase chromatography using a  <dig> μm ×  <dig> cm c <dig>  <dig> μm  <dig> Å protecol column . after washing with buffer a , buffer b  concentration was increased from 5% to 90% in  <dig> mins using three linear gradient steps. the reverse phase nanolc eluent was subjected to positive ion nanoflow electrospray ionisation ms/ms analysis in an information dependant acquisition mode . a tof ms survey scan was acquired , with the three most intense multiply charged ions  in the survey scan subjected to ms/ms. ms/ms spectra were accumulated in the mass range m/z 100- <dig> with a modified enhance all q <dig> transition setting favouring low mass ions so that the reporter itraq tag ions  were enhanced for relative quantitation.

protein identification was performed by combining all the data from each scx fraction following acquisition of the ms/ms raw files. all data were processed using proteinpilot  using the paragon search algorithm. the software correction factors provided in the itraq manufacturer's instructions were entered in the itraq isotope correction factors table. data were searched using the combined p. aeruginosa database described above and a randomized version of the database to calculate false discovery rate . search parameters included trypsin as the proteolytic enzyme, up to two possible missed cleavages and mmts as the selected alkylating agent. data were filtered to a 1% fdr and the minimum number of unique peptides was set to  <dig>  for all proteins identified on the basis of a single confident peptide identification, the ms/ms spectra were manually verified according to  <cit> . spectra with missing itraq labels were omitted from quantitative analysis, unless the corresponding gene was not present in one or more p. aeruginosa strains under study. itraq ratios less than  <dig>  or greater than  <dig>  with a p-value less than  <dig> , or proteins with a ratio less than  <dig>  or greater than  <dig>  with a p-value less than  <dig> , and with consistent results across replicate itraq experiments were deemed significantly differentially abundant.

RESULTS
phenotypic analysis of p. aeruginosa aes-1r compared to pao <dig> and pa14
p. aeruginosa aes-1r was isolated from a child aged  <dig> months at the same time as the deaths of  <dig> cf infants infected with aes- <dig>  <cit> . the genome sequence has recently been completed  <cit> . we undertook phenotypic assays to determine the general virulence properties of aes-1r compared to pao <dig> and pa <dig> . aes-1r displayed small colonies after  <dig> h and may therefore qualify as a small colony variant. aes-1r was also non-mucoid and displayed little biofilm formation capability, which are traits consistent with acute cf isolates. for virulence factor assays, aes-1r produced high levels of pyocyanin, and more elastase, total protease and plc than pao <dig> . rhamnolipid and hemolysin appeared to be consistent between pao <dig> and aes-1r. aes-1r was also comparable in both swimming and twitching motility with both pao <dig> and pa <dig>

comparative gel-based proteomics of p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  pa <dig> and aes-1r
soluble proteins were extracted from stationary phase lb broth cultures of p. aeruginosa strains pao <dig>  pa <dig> and aes-1r, and separated by 2-de. all visible protein spots were excised and identified by maldi-tof ms peptide mass mapping following in-gel trypsin digestion. since many potentially 'unique' protein spots detected by image analysis may be accounted for by minor amino acid sequence differences between isolates that result in spot shifts , we performed statistical analysis only on spots with the same identity, or those that were identified in one isolate alone. a total of  <dig> unique proteins were identified from  <dig> spots , with  <dig> spots  displaying a significant difference in abundance between aes-1r and either, or both of, pao <dig> and pa <dig> .

analysis of the spots that changed in abundance showed that  <dig> were altered identically  in aes-1r compared to both pao <dig> and pa <dig>  a further  <dig> spots were altered in abundance in aes-1r compared to pa <dig>  but not pao <dig>  while  <dig> spots were altered in aes-1r compared to pao <dig>  but not pa <dig>  a single spot  was statistically significantly more abundant in aes-1r compared to pa <dig>  but less abundant in aes-1r compared to pao <dig>  while an additional spot  was present at lower abundance in aes-1r than pa <dig>  but not detected in pao <dig>  the differentially abundant proteins were functionally clustered into  <dig> major groups: i) membrane-associated proteins; ii) heat shock proteins/chaperones; iii) oxidative stress proteins; and iv) previously hypothetical proteins. fourteen proteins were classified as 'membrane-associated', of which  <dig>  were elevated in abundance in aes-1r, and  <dig>  were present at lower abundance in aes-1r, compared to either or both, of pao <dig> and pa <dig>  all  <dig> heat shock proteins  were elevated in aes-1r compared to both pao <dig> and pa <dig>  five proteins involved in oxidative stress resistance  were altered in aes-1r, with all except kata present at increased abundance. additional smaller functional clusters included the  <dig> enzymes of the arginine deiminase pathway  and the atp synthase alpha and beta subunits.

we identified  <dig> proteins that were expressed from genes only encoded in the aes-1r genome , and a further protein that was not contained within the pao <dig> genome . previously hypothetical protein aes_ <dig>  was the most abundant protein identified on the 2-de gels of aes-1r and is present in multiple mass and pi variants. variants exist at two masses, approximately  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda, with three pi variants at the higher mass , and two pi variants at the lower mass . we subjected these spots to both maldi-tof ms peptide mass mapping and to lc-ms/ms for sequence characterization. we identified  <dig> peptide sequences that generated  <dig> % sequence coverage for the predicted aes-1r gene . all variants generated near identical maldi-ms spectra, suggesting the unusual migratory pattern on 2-de gels are due to folding artifacts or poorly reduced disulfide bonds  <cit> . the aes_ <dig> translated gene sequence is predicted to encode a protein of  <dig>  kda and with a pi of  <dig> , suggesting the higher mass variants may be homodimers or artifacts of the gel process. the sequence contains a single cysteine residue through which a disulfide could be formed, however under the reducing conditions used to conduct 2-de, it is more likely that a gel artifact results in the spot pattern. one of the peptides sequenced by ms/ms displayed a non-tryptic n-terminus 8-gtylfqyaqdkdyvlgvsdeqsgak- <dig>  cleaved between met- <dig> and gly- <dig> that suggests either n-terminal processing, or that met- <dig> is the true n-terminus. we subjected the aes_ <dig> protein sequence to blast search and showed that there is 100% amino acid sequence identity with a hypothetical protein  from p. aeruginosa pa <dig> , an isolate from a chronically infected cf patient in boston. other matches displayed similarity to ricin b-type lectins, suggesting the protein might be involved in carbohydrate binding. importantly, however, no other p. aeruginosa genomes within the swiss-prot database contained aes_ <dig> homologs.

comparative gel-free proteomics of p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  pa <dig> and aes-1r using itraq labelling and 2-dlc/ms-ms
proteins from stationary phase cultures of p. aeruginosa aes-1r, pao <dig> and pa <dig> were proteolytically digested, labeled using itraq and analysed by 2-dlc-ms/ms. multiple experiments were performed such that each strain was analysed in duplicate. proteins with a ratio >  <dig>  or <  <dig>  , and >  <dig>  or <  <dig>   were considered to be statistically differentially abundant. we identified a total of  <dig> unique p. aeruginosa proteins, of which  <dig> could be accurately quantified across the strains using itraq.  <dig> proteins displayed significant differential abundance between the p. aeruginosa strains . of these,  <dig> were regulated identically between aes-1r compared to both pao <dig> and pa <dig>   <dig> were only found in aes-1r versus pao <dig>   <dig> were only found in aes-1r versus pa <dig> and  <dig> were differently abundant in aes-1r compared to both pao <dig> and pa <dig>  but in the opposite direction .

functional analysis of the differently abundant proteins showed they could be clustered into  <dig> major groups: i) virulence determinants ; ii) membrane-associated proteins  biosynthesis and outer membrane proteins ); iii) transcriptional and regulatory proteins; iv) proteins involved in translation; v) metabolic proteins; and vi) proteins of no known function. of the  <dig> proteins found to be significantly altered in abundance between aes-1r and pao <dig>   <dig> were present at elevated abundance in the aes-1r strain ; while of the  <dig> proteins significantly altered in abundance between aes-1r and pa <dig>   <dig> were present at increased abundance in aes-1r . within the functional clusters, proteins could also be classified by their relative abundance when compared between strains. for example, proteins involved in translation  were overwhelmingly more abundant in aes-1r than either pa <dig> or pao <dig> .

we observed changes in abundance of several proteins thought to be involved in p. aeruginosa virulence. aes-1r displayed increased levels of chitinase chic, chitin-binding protein cbpd , putative hemolysin , hydrogen cyanide synthase hcnb , while reduced abundance was detected for several other secreted proteins . it is important to note however, that these studies examined only intracellular proteins and do not reflect the amount of protein released into the extracellular environment during stationary phase growth. the lasb data do however, correlate with the phenotypic results observed from the elastase assays, where aes-1r produced more extracellular elastase function than pao <dig>  but less than pa <dig>  abundance differences could be detected for  <dig> proteins involved in the synthesis  or retrieval  of the siderophore pyochelin. interestingly, these were present at increased abundance in aes-1r when compared to pao <dig>  but reduced in aes-1r when compared to pa <dig>  aes-1r also displayed reduced levels of other proteins involved in iron maintenance, including bfra and bfrb bacterioferritin, although increased levels of a putative bacterioferritin  were observed.

aes-1r displayed several changes associated with membrane transport and omps. proteins with elevated abundance were associated with amino acid binding and small molecule transport , as well as several lipoproteins, including osme . aes-1r displayed highly elevated abundance of the type iv pilin structural subunit pila , as well as putative omps pa <dig> and ompa , and the multi-drug efflux system protein mexx. the abundance difference for pila in aes-1r may however be due to significant sequence differences between the  <dig> strains for this protein leading to an artificially inflated ratio . interestingly, a single aes-1r-specific protein  with sequence similarity to an o-antigen/alginate biosynthesis protein udp-n-acetyl-d-mannosaminuronate dehydrogenase, was also identified at very high levels in aes-1r. aes_ <dig> does not have a closely related homolog in either pao <dig> or pa <dig>  resulting in high itraq reporter ratios . a sequence homolog was identified in the liverpool cf epidemic strain lesb <dig> . we also identified a second o-antigen biosynthesis protein, putative udp-n-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase , which appears to be unique to pa <dig>  the presence of these proteins may reflect a difference in the lps expressed in these strains. other lps proteins  were also present in aes-1r at statistically significant altered abundance levels. pagl and kdsa however, were present at reduced abundance in aes-1r, along with several omps .

a number of proteins related to dna replication, cell division and transcriptional regulation were observed to be differentially abundant between aes-1r and pao1/pa <dig> . the majority of these were present at increased abundance in aes-1r, including dna-directed rna polymerase alpha, beta and beta* , ftsh cell division protein , rho transcription termination factor , histone-like protein hu  and dna gyrase subunit a . inspection of the aes-1r gyra protein sequence revealed an amino acid substitution of thr83ile  , which is a reported mutation in a number of cf clinical isolates showing quinolone resistance  <cit> . this mutation is also shared with the liverpool epidemic strain lesb <dig> gyra . interestingly, aes-1r showed increased abundance of the ferric uptake regulator  in comparison to both pao <dig> and pa <dig>  although the degree of this increase was greater in comparison to pa <dig>  fur is the master regulator  of iron acquisition-related genes  <cit> , and increased fur levels are consistent with decreased abundances observed for several iron acquisition proteins  when compared between aes-1r and pa <dig>  conversely however, we observed increased abundances of several of these proteins in aes-1r compared to pao <dig>  despite elevated fur. seven proteins were less abundant in aes-1r than in pao <dig> or pa <dig>  including  <dig> transcriptional regulators , and the recg dna helicase.

all differentially abundant proteins functionally clustered into the translation category were present at increased abundance in aes-1r. these were predominantly ribosomal proteins , although both elongation factors g and ts were also present. chaperonins groel, dnak and htpx were also present at elevated abundance in aes-1r. forty-two proteins functionally classified as 'metabolic proteins' were present at altered abundance in aes-1r compared to pao <dig> and pa <dig>  sub-clusters within this broad functional category were also readily identified. ten proteins involved in fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism were altered in abundance including  <dig> that were more abundant in aes-1r -specific enoyl-coa hydratase ). twelve of the remaining proteins were functionally classified as playing a role in amino acid biosynthesis or degradation. data for the three enzymes  of the arginine deiminase pathway showed all were present at elevated abundance in aes-1r compared to pa <dig>  but were at lower levels in aes-1r than in pao <dig>  these results are in agreement with our 2-de-based observations for aes-1r compared to pa <dig>  where all three of arcabc were present in higher abundance  on gels derived from aes-1r. for aes-1r compared to pao <dig> however, the data conflict to some degree since no difference between these two strains could be observed for arginine deiminase , while carbamate kinase  appeared to be significantly higher in aes-1r than pao <dig>  these results most likely reflect the ability to distinguish different mass and pi variants when using 2-de-based approaches, whereas the itraq peptide-based quantification technique reflects overall protein levels irrespective of chemical or physical protein post-translational modifications. this is further highlighted by our ability to identify  <dig> different forms of the arcb ornithine carbamoyltransferase on 2-de gels .

the final functional group consisted of previously designated 'hypothetical' proteins, or proteins of no known function. of these, one was encoded by a gene found only in aes_1r, while a second was only encoded by pa <dig>  the aes-1r-specific hypothetical protein sequence  was subjected to a blast sequence search and contained a region of sequence similarity to a type ii restriction endonuclease  from citrobacter freudii . the other strain specific protein we identified was unique to pa <dig> . we were unable to find any sequence similarity between this hypothetical protein and any sequenced pseudomonas or other bacterial gene/protein sequence.

the overwhelming advantage of the gel-free approach was the ability to analyse the proteome at a much greater depth than a 2-de gel-based approach. gel-free analysis allowed the identification of  <dig> proteins that were altered in abundance between strains, while 2-de enabled the identification of only  <dig> such proteins. analysis of these  <dig> data sets showed that  <dig> proteins were identified as 'altered' by both 2-de and itraq 2-dlc/ms-ms . the remaining  <dig> proteins identified by 2-de were all characterized by gel-free means, and the majority showed the same n-fold change, but could not be included since they did not reach the required rigorous statistical cut-off for significance. the data do however; show a typical distribution for comparison of 2-de and 2-dlc/ms-ms, where the majority of both identifications and quantified changes can be observed using gel-free means, yet some unique data  are obtained using gel-based approaches. for the overlapping  <dig> proteins, we compared the data derived from both 2-de densitometry and itraq gel-free techniques . the increases and decreases in abundance were generally consistent across techniques for most proteins . 9/ <dig> were detected as changing by itraq 2-dlc/ms-ms but were apparently not changing on 2-de gels, while only 2/ <dig> comparisons showed opposite changes. these last two groups contained many proteins that appear as multiple protein 'spots' on 2-de gels  and thus it is difficult to gauge the overall abundance of those proteins by the gel-based approach.

discussion
this study compared proteome profiles of  <dig> p. aeruginosa strains to identify candidate proteins that may be specific to the acute, transmissible cf strain aes-1r. proteins identified in the aes-1r isolate may reflect adaptations specific to the environmental niche of this organism and that could provide a colonization advantage in the cf lung. a number of virulence determinants differed in abundance between strains, including secreted factors, siderophore and pigment producing enzymes, and oxidative stress response proteins. p. aeruginosa is known to produce a number of secreted virulence factors including toxins, proteases and binding proteins, many of which are under qs regulation  <cit> . aes-1r protein profiles displayed elevated abundances of chitinase chic, chitin-binding protein cbpd, and putative hemolysin , while the major secreted protease elastase lasb was increased in virulent pa <dig>  microarray studies have shown increased expression of hcnb and cbpd in mucoid p. aeruginosa compared to non-mucoid  <cit> . since aes-1r is non-mucoid, it is possible that these proteins are more abundant in cf isolates irrespective of mucoidy when compared to non-cf strains. comparisons of a chronic, rather than acute, cf isolate with pao <dig> also showed increased cbpd gene expression  <cit> . putative hemolysin  is highly expressed in non-mucoid cf clinical isolates and binds oxidised low-density lipoprotein from human serum present in the cf lung  <cit> . increased chitinase production may provide aes-1r with an enhanced ability to degrade lung connective tissues  <cit> . we also observed elevated abundance in aes-1r of pasp , a small protease that cleaves collagens and a virulence determinant in p. aeruginosa-associated corneal infections  <cit> . pasp has been described as an immunogen in  <dig> cf patient sera  <cit> . importantly, it must be noted that our data reflect intracellular levels of these predominantly secreted proteins, suggesting either altered expression or impaired secretion. we were able to detect higher elastase and total protease activities for aes-1r compared to pao <dig>  while total hemolysin activity was approximately the same. similar to the proteomics data, we observed reduced elastase activity for aes-1r compared to pa <dig> 

p. aeruginosa produces compounds such as pyocyanin , hydrogen cyanide , and siderophores for the scavenging of iron. pyocyanin exerts multiple detrimental effects on the host, primarily through its ability to produce reactive oxygen species, and is capable of repressing transcription of host oxidative stress defense proteins  <cit> , interfering with metabolism  <cit> , inhibiting beating of cilia  <cit> , proinflammatory action  <cit> , neutrophil apoptosis  <cit>  and increased levels correlate with cf pulmonary exacerbations  <cit> . p. aeruginosa possesses two operons  for the synthesis of phenazine-carboxylic acid , which is then further processed by phzm to 1-hydroxyphenazine  and finally, phzs to pyocyanin. these intermediates also exhibit cytotoxic effects on the host  <cit> . we observed elevated levels of phzs in aes-1r compared to pao <dig>  and pa <dig> , yet a decrease in comparative phzb <dig> levels. increased phzs may reflect elevated 1-hp to pyocyanin, which is supported by several studies showing pyocyanin production is enhanced in cf strains  <cit>  and reflected in aes-1r phenotypic data compared to pao <dig> . decreased phzb <dig> abundance may reflect differential induction of the  <dig> phz operons across strains  <cit> .

iron acquisition via siderophore production is critical for successful colonization of the cf lung and for providing p. aeruginosa with a distinct competitive advantage over other pathogens. the host generally limits free iron by sequestration via transferrin, ferritin and lactoferrin. the cf lung may contain higher iron availability , most likely due to tissue damage resulting from an exaggerated inflammatory response. p. aeruginosa produces the pyochelin and pyoverdine siderophores to acquire iron from the environment and the later is thought to be a major contributor in the cf lung  <cit> . we observed increases in abundance of pyochelin synthetases  in aes-1r compared to pao <dig>  transcriptomic studies have also shown increased expression of pchef in a chronic cf isolate  <cit> . in contrast, pa <dig> produced even greater levels of pchef, as well as pyochelin synthetase pchg and the fe-pyochelin outer membrane receptor fpta. this confirms that iron acquisition is important in general virulence as well as in the specific cf lung micro-environment. other proteins involved in iron uptake and storage were differentially abundant between the strains studied. the iron storage bacterioferritins bfra and bfrb were decreased in abundance in aes-1r, however a putative bacterioferritin pa <dig> was markedly increased in abundance suggesting it may be the preferred storage protein in this isolate. these data correlated with previous transcript analyses--increased expression of pa <dig> was observed in a chronic cf isolate compared to pao <dig>  <cit> , while decreased bfrb was observed under iron starvation suggesting aes-1r is adapted to an iron-limited environment  <cit> .

cf-associated aes-1r was the only strain with detectable flagellin in the protein extracts analysed by 2-de. aes-1r flic has significant protein sequence differences compared with pao <dig> and pa <dig>  and has greater sequence similarity with the type a flagellin of strain pak . increased flagellin in aes-1r is consistent with our phenotypic data for swimming motility and with previous work showing aes- <dig> isolates displayed greater motility than non-clonal cf isolates  <cit> . several differences in the omp profile of aes-1r were observed. the loss of oprd in aes-1r is characteristic of carbapenem antibiotic resistance  <cit> . decreased oprg expression was originally associated with increased fluoroquinolone resistance  <cit> , however a recent study showed no significant difference in the antibiotic susceptibility profile of an oprg-deficient strain  <cit> . Δoprg p. aeruginosa do show a 3-fold decrease in cytotoxicity toward the human bronchial epithelial cell line hbe, however transcriptomics revealed a rapid down-regulation of oprg in wild-type p. aeruginosa upon interaction with these cells  <cit> . mexx, a component of the mexxy-oprm multidrug efflux transporter, was markedly increased in abundance in aes-1r and is known to confer resistance to a number of antibiotics including erythromycin, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides and the ß-lactams, cefepime and ceftobiprole  <cit> , correlating well with the antibiotic resistance associated with cf infections. quinolones are the antibiotic of choice for treatment of p. aeruginosa cf lung infections and resistance to this class of drug can result from mutations within dna gyrase gyra , which is essential for dna replication. the aes-1r gyra gene sequence revealed an amino acid substitution  previously reported to result in quinolone resistance  <cit>  and observed in the liverpool epidemic strain lesb <dig>  increased abundance of pa <dig> , a protein containing a domain with predicted bacterial wall degradation properties may suggest a potential advantage against competing pathogens. p. aeruginosa is predicted to contain approximately  <dig> genes encoding lipoproteins  <cit> . a number of lipoproteins were observed at increased abundance in aes-1r. induction of lipoprotein genes has been associated with an excessive proinflammatory response in lung epithelial cells via toll-like receptor  <dig>  <cit> . opri  is an immunogenic lipoprotein that has been proposed as part of a multivalent vaccine  <cit> . we observed reduced opri abundance in aes-1r, which may influence the efficacy of an opri-based vaccine.

lps is a major virulence factor that is involved in initiating the pro-inflammatory response in the host. p. aeruginosa strains produce different lps types, which are currently classified into  <dig> serotypes. strain-specific enzymes involved in o-antigen synthesis were identified in aes-1r ) and pa <dig> ) and these may reflect serotype differences. lps has also been implicated in evasion of the host immune response and antibiotic resistance in cf lung infection  <cit> . the lps modification enzyme lipid a 3-o-deacylase pagl  catalyses the production of a penta-acylated lipid a  <cit> . reduced abundance of pagl in aes-1r  is consistent with previous findings showing a third of p. aeruginosa isolates from cf patients with severe lung disease produced hexa- or hepta-acylated lipid a, due to a decrease in 3-o-deacylase activity  <cit> . a consistent finding in aes-1r was increased abundance of enzymes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis. further weight is given to this evidence from transcriptomic results showing increased expression levels of fatty acid biosynthesis enzymes in a chronic cf isolate compared to pao <dig>  <cit> . this collection of pathways supplies an essential building block used in a number of cell processes, particularly membrane synthesis and provides the acyl groups necessary for the synthesis of acyl-homoserine lactones   <cit> , the autoinducer signal molecules necessary for qs.

our studies allowed the identification of previously hypothetical proteins, particularly those unique to aes-1r. a protein of unknown function  was the most abundant observed on the 2-de profiles of aes-1r. aes_ <dig> is found in a large region of the aes-1r genome  containing nearly entirely aes-1r-specific coding sequences  <cit> . this protein sequence could only be found by blast search in a second cf-associated p. aeruginosa isolate , and contains a ricin-type lectin conserved domain that is associated with carbohydrate binding. analysis of mucin glycosylation in the sputum of cf patients has shown altered glycan patterns, consisting of increased sialylation and reduced sulfation and fucosylation  <cit> . since mucin glycan structures may be altered, specific proteins such as aes_7139/pa2g_ <dig> could be necessary for binding lung epithelium. certainly the overall abundance detected here suggests a central role for this protein in the environmental survival of aes-1r and a potential role in early infection. a further two aes-1r-specific hypothetical proteins  were also identified.

approximately a third of the theoretical p. aeruginosa proteome  was identified by gel-free 2-dlc/ms-ms, with 75% of these providing sufficient data for accurate quantitation. the 2-de approach however does allow for the relative abundance of individual proteins to be compared within a sample . 2-de also provides additional information regarding protein variants, processing or post-translational modification, as well as facilitating the identification of proteins with sequence differences compared to genomically characterized relatives or highlighting mis-annotations within a gene sequence  and type iv pilin types ). transcriptomic analyses are able to quantitate gene expression accurately up to  <dig>  orders of magnitude  <cit> , however proteomic strategies such as itraq only achieve measurement of around  <dig> orders of magnitude. technical limitations of the itraq method may lead to an underestimation of the magnitude of change  <cit> , while many proteins are below the limit of detection by 2-de. clear examples of itraq ratio underestimation are seen in proteins that are unique to a particular strain, such as aes_ <dig> , which despite being absent in pao <dig> and pa <dig> only achieved measured ratios of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively.

CONCLUSIONS
a complementary proteomic approach combining gel-based  and gel-free  techniques was employed to quantitatively compare the proteomes of p. aeruginosa strains pao <dig>  pa <dig> and aes-1r . proteins associated with aes-1r belonged to a variety of functional groups including virulence factors, antibiotic resistance, lps and fatty acid biosynthesis, and several hypothetical proteins. proteins involved in the acquisition of iron were elevated in aes-1r compared to pao <dig>  while being decreased compared to pa <dig>  these results confirm that cf-associated p. aeruginosa strains express a unique protein profile indicative of phenotypic adaptations to their environment and that provide traits conferring an advantage in colonization of the cf lung micro-environment. identification of the proteins used by transmissible strains will aid in the elucidation of novel intervention strategies to reduce the burden of p. aeruginosa infection in cf patients.
