BACKGROUND
the 'kuerlexiangli’ pear is one of the characteristic and economically important fruit trees in xinjiang uygur autonomous region, china. fruit of this cultivar is a rich source of juice and has few stone cells, good flavor, and tantalizing aroma. however, a persistent calyx seriously affects the fruit shape  as well as quality. fruit with calyx abscission have higher titer of soluble sugars and vitamin c, lower titer of titratable acids compared with persistent calyx fruit 
 <cit> . thus calyx persistence significantly affects the commercial importance of 'kuerlexiangli’ and causes serious loss in economic value.

previously, few studies have focused on calyx abscission of pear, which is clearly regulated by ethylene, whilst auxins apparently decrease the ratio of calyx abscission 
 <cit> . on the other hand, the rate of calyx abscission in 'kuerlexiangli’ fruit is varied among different pollinizer varieties, with higher calyx abscission rates obtained when flowers were pollinated with 'xueqing’, 'yali’, 'zhongliyihao’ and 'cuiguan’ pear 
 <cit> . moreover, manually excising the calyx was helpful for enhancing the comprehensive quality of pear fruit 
 <cit> .

recent research has mainly focused on the physiological aspects of the calyx development process, with emphasis on anatomy, and the role of nutrition and hormone control. microstructure data of calyx tubes at the calyx developing stage after spraying 300 mg kg- <dig> paclobutrazol   or 50 mg kg- <dig> ga <dig>  showed that the average area of vascular bundle of calyx tube tissue was bigger and many sieve tube cells and idioblasts gradually appeared when the tree was treated with ga <dig>  when the tree was treated with pp <dig>  calyx tubes of young fruit only had vessels in vascular bundle. abscission layer appeared at the late young fruit of calyx tube developing stage, and finally the calyx tube broke off and young fruit developed as calyx fruit 
 <cit> . the physiological evidence indicates a role of both nutrition and hormone regulation in calyx abscission. sufficient fe content is a guarantee for fruit calyx development 
 <cit> . high content of zeatin-riboside  and indoleacetic acid  in young fruit, high content of iaa and ga <dig> but low content of abscisic acid  in calyx, high ratio of iaa, zr, ga <dig> between calyx and young fruit, and low ratio of aba between calyx and young fruit all promoted calyx persistence 
 <cit> . however, the key genes that control or regulate fruit calyx abscission or persistence are still unknown. thus the understanding of gene expression and regulation differences under calyx abscission and calyx persistence status and the responses to different chemical agents leading to different calyx status is necessary.

next generation sequencing methods have emerged as a cost-effective high-throughput approach to the sequencing of a very large number of expressed genes even in small experiments. one of these, digital transcript abundance measurements method is a revolutionary approach for expression analysis competing to replace microarrays for analyzing transcriptome 
 <cit> . it is tag-based transcriptome sequencing for measuring relative gene expression levels, which can identify, quantify, and annotate expressed genes on the whole genome level with or even without prior sequence knowledge. it enables an entirely new scale of biological experimentation to reveal related pathways or identify target genes involved in different bio-processes. for example, digital transcript abundance measurements approach has been used to study gene expression in the poplar  under salt stress 
 <cit> . to identify the candidate genes for sex determination of papaya , papaya male, female, and hermaphrodite plants were used for digital transcriptome analysis using high-throughput serial analysis of gene expression 
 <cit> . the molecular regulation mechanism of the physiological and biochemical response to potassium starvation in soybean roots and shoots was investigated by high-throughput tag-sequencing 
 <cit> . differentially expressed genes in cucumber  root under waterlogging stress have also been identified by digital transcript abundance measurements 
 <cit> . overall, the digital transcript abundance measurements method has provided more valuable tools for qualitative and quantitative gene expression analysis than the earlier microarray based assays 
 <cit> .

most current molecular knowledge on the abscission process has been obtained from the model plant arabidopsis thaliana <cit> , as well as tomato  
 <cit> . the apple cluster during immature fruit drop also represents an ideal system to study the shedding of actively growing organs 
 <cit> . recently developed molecular approaches have been used in abscission process in horticulture crops. previous studies have identified the transcriptomes associated with flower abscission in tomato 
 <cit> , differential gene expression by the cdna microarray technique during abscission of citrus leaves under ethylene treatment 
 <cit>  and fruitlet abscission in apple 
 <cit> . the differentially expressed genes have been identified during shedding of immature apple fruits have been identified with a cdna-aflp approach 
 <cit> , and the role of naa and shading in apple fruit abscission have been analyzed by the transcriptome method 
 <cit> . however, a deep knowledge of the molecular events occurring during the early phases of calyx abscission induction is still lacking. the new release of the whole genome sequence of asian pear 'dangshansuli’ 
 <cit> , lays a good platform for genome-wide gene analysis. here we report on the first use of genome-wide analysis to gain insight into the wide range of transcriptional responses associated with calyx abscission processes. using solexa/illumina’s sequencing system, the transcriptomes were compared between chemical regulation of calyx abscission, 6000 × flusilazole plus 300 × pbo inducing calyx abscission, and 50 mg.l- <dig> ga <dig> treatment to reduce calyx abscission. by investigating the expression of genes related to calyx abscission in 'kuerlexiangli’, a number of pathways and candidate genes that are important in this process were identified.

RESULTS
effects of different treatments on calyx abscission rate
comparison of flusilazole treatment and ga <dig> treatment as inducer/inhibitor of fruit abscission revealed significant differences in abscission rates . at  <dig> d after treatments, the rate of calyx abscission in the untreated control was  <dig> %, and the flusilazole treatment increased the calyx abscission rate to  <dig> %, but the ga <dig> treatment decreased the calyx abscission ratio to  <dig> %. thus the application of flusilazole treatment increased the calyx abscission rate by  <dig>  times whereas ga <dig> treatment decreased the calyx abscission rate to one fourteenth.figure  <dig>

digital transcript abundance measurements libraries sequencing
illumina sequencing analysis was performed to obtain a global view of the calyx abscission of 'kuerlexiangli’ through analysis of the transcriptomes of flusilazole treatment and ga <dig> treatment. seven samples from c <dig> to c <dig> were used as material for digital transcript abundance measurements analysis . calyx digital transcript abundance measurements libraries  were deep sequenced altogether. the number of reads for each library ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  million. a total of  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig> reads of raw data were obtained for c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  and c <dig> libraries, respectively. in this study, the tag sequences of the seven digital transcript abundance measurements libraries were mapped to the assembled pear genome of 'dangshansuli’ 
 <cit> . finally, this generated  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig> reads corresponding to  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of all clean data in the seven libraries that could be mapped to the reference database. the q <dig> percentages  of all seven libraries were above 95%. all of these data showed that the throughput and sequencing quality was high enough for further analysis.table  <dig>

analysis of differential gene expression
to compare differential expression patterns among seven libraries, we employed ideg <dig>  to identify mrnas showing statistically significant differences based on their relative abundance, as reflected by total count of individual sequence reads, between all pairs of libraries. we compared the six test libraries with the control, two treatments during the same stage, and the same treatment during different stages, so that  <dig> pairs of comparisons were implemented. among these comparisons, we found that  <dig>  to  <dig>  genes had significant changes in expression, and the average number was  <dig>  . the differential expression pattern among libraries revealed that the largest differences occurred between c <dig> and c <dig>  a total of  <dig>  genes were significantly differentially expressed between c <dig> and c <dig>  of these genes,  <dig>  genes were up-regulated and  <dig>  were down-regulated in c <dig> compared with c <dig>  the smallest difference was observed between c <dig> and c <dig>  in which only  <dig>  differentially expressed genes  were identified.figure  <dig> 
genes differentially expressed between different libraries. up-regulated  and down-regulated  genes were quantified. the results of  <dig> comparisons are shown.



we also detected a large number of specifically expressed genes  between each pair of libraries . comparisons showed that there were  <dig> to  <dig>  segs with an average number of  <dig>  among  <dig> comparisons. these segs will help us to find genes correlated with calyx abscission process. especially a number of stage-specific and treatment-specific expressed genes are likely to be key genes associated with calyx abscission.figure  <dig> 
quantification of genes specifically expressed between different samples. the numbers of digital transcript abundance measurements genes of  <dig> comparisons between each two samples are shown in red and blue histograms .



functional annotation of differentially expressed genes
gene ontology  is an international standardized gene function classification system that describes properties of genes and their products in any organism. in this study, a total of  <dig>  differentially expressed genes that could be categorized into  <dig> functional groups were found . the major subcategories were as follows: four subcategories for cellular component ; three subcategories for molecular function ; and seven subcategories for biological process . these results indicate that expressed genes functioning in 'binding’, 'catalytic activity’, 'metabolic process’, and 'cellular process’ are important during the calyx abscission process. only a few genes were clustered in terms of 'synapse’, 'synapse part’, 'metallochaperone activity’, 'biological adhesion’ and 'immune system process’ and 'viral reproduction’.figure  <dig> 
go categories of the genes identified. y-axis  represents percentages of genes identified in this study, y-axis  represent the actual gene number. the genes were annotated in three main categories: biological process, cellular component, and molecular function .



to further investigate the function of different expressed genes during calyx abscission, significantly enriched kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathways were identified according to the p values and enrichment factor. performing a blast search against the kegg database indicated that expressed genes were involved in  <dig> pathways . as shown in additional file 
 <dig>  nine kegg pathways were observed to be significantly overrepresented in calyx abscission processes. those genes correlated with calyx abscission mainly involved in photosynthesis, plant hormone signal transduction, cell wall modification, transcriptional regulation and carbohydrate metabolism were used for subsequent analysis. these trends were consistent with overall developmental activities during abscission processes 
 <cit> . in addition, several other biological processes that have not previously been reported to be associated with calyx abscission, such as flavonoid biosynthesis and flavone/flavonol biosynthesis, were found dramatically changed during calyx abscission processes. these might be novel genes that are relevant to the calyx abscission process in 'kuerlexiangli’ fruit.

cluster of calyx abscission-related genes
impacts on photosynthesis
decrease in photosynthesis may be an important contributing factor for the abscission of flowers and fruitlets in the abscission processes 
 <cit> , which was confirmed by our present experiment. our results showed that  <dig> genes encoding photosynthesis-related genes were differential expression under different treatments . altered expressions were found for numerous genes involved in carbon fixation, photosystem i, photosystem ii, and photosynthetic electron transport. flusilazole treatment decreased the expression of genes involved with psi, psii activity and photosynthetic electron transport in photosystem. the down-regulated genes included those that encode subunit v, psaa/psab, f-type h+-transporting atpase subunit gamma in photosystem i, and 13 kda protein in photosystem ii . we identified that ga <dig> treatment led to strong induction in photosynthesis-related gene expression . these results indicate that photosynthesis might play an important role in the calyx abscission and samples with diminished photosynthesis function are more prone to abscission.table  <dig> 
selected genes with altered expression during calyx abscission process




plant hormone signal transduction
many kinds of hormones regulate the process of abscission, such as iaa, aba, ga, ja, and ethylene, among which iaa and ethylene play a pivotal role. iaa prevents, while ethylene accelerates the abscission processes 
 <cit> . forty-three genes were found to be involved in ethylene synthesis, perception, and response in the present study. acc synthase  and acc oxidase  are rate-limiting enzymes in ethylene biosynthesis 
 <cit> . genes involved in acc synthase  showed expressions increased by  <dig>  to  <dig>  times during the early calyx abscission process after flusilazole treatment. two acc oxidase genes  were up-regulated in later calyx abscission process after flusilazole treatment. on the other hand, two ethylene receptor genes  and three ethylene responsive genes  were up-regulated in later calyx abscission process after flusilazole treatment . this is consistent with the correlation between abscission and increased expression of genes for ethylene synthesis and ethylene receptors in az , which has been reported in mature fruit of olive 
 <cit>  and apple 
 <cit> . the general rule states that provided the flux of iaa to the abscission zone is maintained, cell separation is inhibited and abscission does not happen 
 <cit> . one hundred and two auxin-related genes were differentially expressed by the flusilazole and ga <dig> treatments, including indole-3-acetic acid-amido synthetase, indole-3-acetic acid-induced protein, and auxin response factor. nine genes encoding aux/iaa protein were down-regulated at  <dig> d after flusilazole treatment and  <dig> genes encoding auxin responsive factors were also down-regulated at  <dig> d after flusilazole treatment. genes related to polar auxin transporting were also affected by ga <dig> treatment, with auxin influx carriers induced and efflux carriers largely repressed. we found that an auxin transport-related gene  was up-regulated at  <dig> d, but repressed at  <dig> d after flusilazole treatment. in addition, a gene  encoding spermidine synthase was up-regulated with flusilazole treatment at onset of calyx abscission processes. as mentioned above, hormones seem to play a relatively important role during the early phases of abscission in the calyx, since a majority of the transcriptionally activated elements involved in hormone signaling seem to be downstream of the induction of abscission. it is especially interesting that expression of more genes associated with ethylene and auxin metabolism and signal transduction were altered during calyx expression process than previously reported.

cell wall degradation-related genes are highly expressed in calyx process
abscission involves progressive dissolution of the middle lamella. a key step in loss of adhesion between cells within a separation layer is the induction of cell wall-degrading enzymes such as polygalacturonases. the role of other wall-modifying proteins such as expansin, xyloglucan transglucosylase hydrolase, pectinesterase, etc. has also been studied during abscission processes 
 <cit> . polygalacturonases have been studied in tomato abscission zones 
 <cit> , in oilseed rape and arabidopsis leaf and flower abscission zones 
 <cit> , while celluloses have been studied in cotton 
 <cit> , citrus fruit 
 <cit>  and red raspberry abscission zones 
 <cit> . reports have indicated that an increase in expansin 
 <cit> , xyloglucan transglucosylase hydrolases 
 <cit>  and pectate lyases 
 <cit>  correlate with organ abscission. a large number of genes encoding cell wall hydrolases, expansin, and lyases were found to be over-represented with flusilazole treatment . in this study, a gene  encoding polygalacturonase and a gene  encoding pectinesterase were up-regulated at  <dig> d after flusilazole treatment. we also observed expansin expression in calyx abscission process. three genes  encoding xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase were up-regulated at  <dig> d after flusilazole treatment . pectate lyases  could facilitate cell wall disassembly by their action on demethylated pectin through beta elimination in the presence of ca2+, leading to depolymerization of pectic polysaccharides 
 <cit> . some candidate genes related with this reaction identified in this study may play roles in cell wall degradation, such as pbr <dig> , pbr <dig> , pbr <dig> , and pbr <dig> , all of which probably aid in later abscission processes.

genes encoding transcription factors
transcription factors  act as major switches of regulatory cascades during development, and alterations in the expression of such genes may affect various developmental processes. our digital transcript abundance measurements results showed that  <dig> genes encoding transcription factors were differentially expressed, including erf/apetala <dig>  myb, and wrky transcription factors, and mads-box proteins . apetala <dig>  is a floral homeotic factor that plays an important role in the control of arabidopsis flower and seed development and encodes a putative tf that is distinguished by a novel dna-binding motif referred to as the ap <dig> domain 
 <cit> . the expression of a gene  encoding for a tf containing an ap <dig> domain was transiently up-regulated specifically at a later stage under ga <dig> treatment. multiple up-regulated myb factors at  <dig> d after flusilazole treatment were identified, including myb <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  moreover, myb <dig> is a flavonol-specific activator of flavonoid biosynthesis, strongly triggering the promoters of genes encoding chalcone synthase , flavanone-3-hydroxylase , and flavonol synthase , which are all involved in the biosynthesis of flavonols 
 <cit> . the up-regulation of mby <dig>  consistently resulted in an enhanced transcript level of chs at  <dig> d after flusilazole treatment. interestingly, auxin and ethylene induce flavonol accumulation through partly identical transcription networks 
 <cit> . we hypothesize that the calyx abscission zone contains higher levels of flavonols and flavonoids, which might have functions in stress defense after calyx abscission. the wrky family is a superfamily of tfs, which hold central positions mediating fast positive and negative regulation of disease resistance 
 <cit> . two wrky genes were up-regulated transiently at  <dig> d after flusilazole treatment , which showed similar change pattern to that reported in tomato flower abscission zone 
 <cit> . on the whole, all above results suggest that many transcription factors play an important role in regulating calyx abscission processes in pear.

genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism
a strong connection between the carbohydrate amounts available for the fruitlet, especially soluble sugars, and their probability of abscission has been suggested 
 <cit> . this phenomenon has been also described for pistachio 
 <cit> . so abscission may be due to a lack of carbohydrates. in our digital transcript abundance measurements results,  <dig> carbohydrate metabolism genes had significantly altered expression profiles in response to flusilazole treatment and ga <dig> treatment . affected genes within this group include those associated with glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, fatty acid biosynthesis, and sucrose metabolic processes. for example, we found induction of alpha-amylase , beta-fructofuranosidase , alcohol dehydrogenase , and acetyl-coa carboxylase  under flusilazole treatment. a different gene set showed lower expression in calyx abscission. this set comprised genes coding for 2-isopropylmalate synthase , pyruvate decarboxylase , sorbitol dehydrogenase  and ribulose- <dig> -bisphosphate carboxylase . some of the genes are clearly connected to sugar mobilization, such as alpha-amylase and glycosyl hydrolase, which were up-regulated at  <dig> d after flusilazole treatment. the gene  encoding udp-glucosyltransferases  was highly expressed under flusilazole treatment in the abscission process . in apple, udp-glucosyltransferases were also expressed during fruit abscission 
 <cit> . genes related to sucrose metabolism, e.g., sucrose-phosphate synthase , glycosyltransferase , and glucose-1-phosphate adenyltransferase  were up-regulated under ga <dig> treatment during the later calyx abscission process, while beta-fructofuranosidase was up-regulated under flusilazole treatment at the onset of calyx abscission process. levels of sugars like galactose, fructose, and glucose, as well as transcripts for their transporters, increase in senescing leaves analogously to what happens under environmental stresses, such as cold and dehydration 
 <cit> . a gene encoding a sugar transporter was up-regulated with flusilazole treatment at the onset of the calyx abscission processes observed for pbr <dig> . sorbitol dehydrogenase  has been identified as a key enzyme in sorbitol metabolism, converting sorbitol into fructose 
 <cit> . in this study, four genes encoding sdh  were down-regulated with flusilazole treatment in later calyx abscission processes, suggesting that sorbitol catabolism was largely inhibited, resulting in abscission.

other differentially regulated genes
there were other genes that showed high-level differential expression related to calyx abscission . e <dig> ubiquitin-protein ligase has been shown to play an important role in hormone regulation, photomorphogenesis, floral homeosis, senescence, and pathogen defense in plant 
 <cit> . expression of pbr <dig> , encoding e <dig> ubiquitin-protein ligase, was up-regulated under flusilazole treatment during the calyx abscission processes. expression of pbr <dig> , encoding acyltransferase, was up-regulated in late calyx abscission processes. one gene  encoding cysteine-rich receptor-like protein kinase 26-like was identified. cysteine-rich receptor-like kinases is one of the largest groups of receptor-like kinases, which have been suggested to play important roles in the regulation of pathogen defense and programmed cell death 
 <cit> . it is notable that the gene pbr <dig>  was up-regulated with flusilazole treatment in both early and late calyx abscission processes; it showed 69% identity with ida  protein of arabidopsis, which is associated with regulation of floral organ abscission. ida encodes a small protein with an n-terminal signal peptide. analysis of ida mutant plants indicates that ida regulates floral organ abscission through an ethylene insensitive pathway. overexpression of ida results in early abscission and production of arabinose and galactose in the floral azs 
 <cit> . this suggests that the activity of ida may be important to the onset and later stages of the calyx abscission process. however, further functional experiments are necessary to confirm this point. in addition, some differentially expressed genes  without annotation were also found. we hypothesize that these genes are putative calyx abscission-related transcripts.

confirmation of differentially expressed genes by qrt-pcr
in order to verify the genes that were actually differentially expressed during the calyx abscission processes, the expressive abundance of seven selected genes was analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr. the results showed that although the exact fold changes of six of the selected genes at several data points varied between digital transcript abundance measurements and qrt-pcr analysis, trends of gene expression change detected by the two different approaches were largely consistent. only one gene  did not show consistent expression between accurate quantification of expression and digital transcript abundance measurements . pearson’s correlation coefficient  showed that both the digital transcript abundance measurements and qrt-pcr data were highly correlated, with the r-value ranging from  <dig>   to  <dig>  , which was in agreement with previous report 
 <cit> . the qrt-pcr further demonstrated that genes related to photosystem reaction , hormone-related transcripts , carbohydrate metabolism  and other differentially regulated genes  showed significant difference between treatments and participated in the process of calyx abscission or persistent processes.

CONCLUSIONS
the present results have demonstrated the usefulness of the digital transcript abundance measurements approach to identify differentially expressed genes between flusilazole treatment and ga <dig> treatment. these differentially expressed genes may well be important for calyx abscission in fruit. in addition, a list of candidate target genes for functional studies involving calyx abscission process was generated. among the isolated candidate genes, ida appears to play a key role during calyx abscission processes. further studies should be concentrated on functional characterization of these genes in the future. this study could lead to better understanding of the molecular mechanism of the phenotypic difference between calyx abscission and persistent fruits. moreover, the findings of this study may facilitate the selection of new chemical agents and accelerate genetic strategies for the development of more effective pear calyx abscission for commercial purposes.
