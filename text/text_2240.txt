BACKGROUND
the campanulaceae sensu stricto are a nearly cosmopolitan angiosperm family consisting of latex-bearing, primarily perennial herbs or occasional subshrubs that typically have alternate leaves, sympetalous corollas, inferior ovaries, and capsular fruits. allied to the campanulaceae are the lobeliaceae, cyphiaceae, cyphocarpaceae, nemacladaceae, pentaphragmataceae, and sphenocleaceae; at times, all of these taxa have been included in the campanulaceae at varying taxonomic rank by different authors . taxonomic treatments lack consensus  and phylogenetic work has only recently been attempted. campanulaceae in the strict sense are recognized as  <dig>  <cit>  to  <dig>  <cit>  species distributed among  <dig>  <cit>  to  <dig>  <cit>  genera. generic circumscription and intrafamilial classification vary widely according to author. within the family as few as two  <cit>  and as many as  <dig>  <cit>  tribes have been recognized . fedorov's more recent work  <cit>  recognized eight tribes , but only included taxa present in the former soviet union. although kolakovsky's treatment of old world campanulaceae  <cit>  is the most recently published attempt to produce a more complete intrafamilial classification of the campanulaceae , the scope of the work is limited compared to that of either a. de candolle  <cit>  or fedorov  <cit> . in all treatments, the campanuleae and wahlenbergieae  are typically the largest, most inclusive taxa, with segregate tribes consisting of only one to a few genera.

the most comprehensive treatment of the campanulaceae remains the monograph of a. de candolle  <cit> , who recognized two groups corresponding to the wahlenbergieae and campanuleae . simple basal leaves and simple, alternate or occasional whorled, cauline leaves that are often different in shape than the basal leaves, characterize the campanuleae in de candolle's sense. flowers are solitary or borne in cymes or racemes, and have five corolla lobes that are mostly fused proximally. the inferior ovary usually has 3– <dig> carpels and develops into a capsule that mostly dehisces by lateral pores . the wahlenbergieae are mostly perennials characterized by simple, alternate, cauline leaves. flowers are solitary or borne in cymes or heads, and petals may be free, proximally fused, or distally fused. the ovary is inferior, semi-inferior, or superior, and consists of two, three, or five carpels. the fruit is generally a capsule dehiscing by apical pores or valves . both groups have five stamens with filaments that are often proximally dilated and anthers with introrse dehiscence; nectaries are generally present, and many ovules are attached to axile placentae. the entire family is characterized by secondary pollen presentation in which protandry is combined with a close association of anthers around the style and introrse pollen discharge onto the style for presentation to pollinators. this syndrome is similar to that found in lobeliaceae and asteraceae, but invaginating stylar hairs are unique to the campanulaceae.

capsule characters vary considerably and provide the basis for most intrafamilial classification schemes. campanuleae typically include taxa with capsules dehiscing by lateral pores, whereas wahlenbergieae usually include taxa with capsules dehiscing by apical valves. ovary characters, such as carpel number and position, have also been important in traditional classifications. for example, the monotypic tribe platycodoneae  <cit>  or subtribe platycodinae  is sometimes segregated. it is defined by carpels that are equal in number to and alternate with the calyx lobes, whereas in campanuleae and wahlenbergieae the carpels are often fewer than the calyx lobes, or if the same in number then opposite them  <cit> . little correlation appears to exist among diagnostic features; therefore there is considerable taxonomic disagreement among classifications. in certain instances it is difficult to discern the rationale behind tribal placement of individual genera.

the high level of disagreement among both inter- and intrafamilial classifications of the campanulaceae indicates that phylogenetic assessment of the family is needed. cosner, in her thesis  <cit> , included an early version of a portion of the work described here, and eddie, in his thesis  <cit>  developed phylogenetic hypotheses based on its sequence data and morphology. an expanded version of the its work has been published  <cit>  but leaves some major lineages unsampled and the relationships among some major groups are unresolved or poorly supported. further phylogenetic work is clearly warranted. the chloroplast genome has proven to be a useful tool for phylogenetic reconstruction. chloroplast dna  of land plants is highly conserved in nucleotide sequence as well as gene content and order; its relatively slow rate of evolution makes it an excellent molecule for phylogenetic and evolutionary studies  <cit> . chloroplast genomes of photosynthetic angiosperms average about  <dig> kilobase pairs  in size; the circular chromosome is divided by two copies of a large  inverted repeat  into large and small single copy regions   <cit> . restriction site mapping, gene sequencing, and analysis of gene order rearrangements have been used to study cpdna variation for phylogenetic investigations  <cit> . here we use the distribution of gene order changes in the chloroplast genomes of the campanulaceae to estimate phylogenetic relationships in the family.

generally, major gene order changes are rare. therefore, when they occur, such mutations are extremely useful as phylogenetic markers because they are readily polarized and typically lack homoplasy  <cit> . four categories of cpdna gene order rearrangements have been proposed: 1) inversions, 2) insertions or deletions, 3) ir expansion or contraction or loss, and 4) transpositions; all of which may have occurred during chloroplast genome evolution in the campanulaceae  <cit> . when rearrangements have been discovered elsewhere, they are generally few and easily characterized. the distributions of such characters make effective markers of monophyletic groups. for example, both the loss of one copy of the ir and inversions are extremely useful characters in legume phylogeny  <cit> , defining large clades within the family. other examples of phylogenetically informative inversions are found within asteraceae  <cit> , ranunculaceae  <cit> , ferns  <cit> , and vascular plants  <cit> . many other examples could be cited.

the earlier work of cosner  <cit>  and knox  <cit>  characterized some chloroplast genomes of the campanulales and identified a number of rearrangements relative to the consensus gene order of angiosperms found in tobacco. members of the lobeliaceae exhibit multiple rearrangements but are less rearranged than the campanulaceae. three rearrangements may be shared between the two families – a loss of the accd gene, the expansion of the inverted repeat into the small single copy region, and, perhaps, an inversion of the region corresponding to tobacco probes 40– <dig>  then, within the campanulaceae, more than  <dig> inversions, more than eight putative transpositions, two additional gene losses, additional ir expansion or contraction events and  <dig> large insertions greater than  <dig> kb in size may have contributed to observed differences among the chloroplast genomes sampled  <cit> . due to this unprecedented number of gene order mutations, it is not possible to unambiguously determine the evolutionary order of most events or in some cases to even define the events themselves. this complex situation poses special problems for using these rearrangements to estimate phylogenetic relationships. in this paper we develop alternative character codings for the data and compare the results of parsimony analyses of the different data sets. in addition, we compare the ability of the gene order data to support robust phylogenetic hypotheses to that of sequence data from rbcl and its. finally, the phylogenetic implications of the cpdna rearrangement data for the campanulaceae are discussed.

RESULTS
our data indicate that the eighteen mapped campanulaceae chloroplast genomes  are drastically rearranged relative to those of other land plants . the tobacco cpdna gene order represents the consensus gene order for angiosperms  <cit> . therefore rearrangements in campanulaceae chloroplast genomes were identified relative to tobacco. because characterizing specific mutational events was not always possible three different coding methods  were developed. matrix  <dig> coded all gene order changes as endpoints . matrix  <dig> and  <dig> involved recoding some endpoint characters to recognize  <dig> specific mutations. matrix  <dig> and  <dig> were analyzed with and without weighting. see methods for additional details on character encoding and analyses.

seventy-nine variable characters were included in the endpoints only matrix . forty-two of the derived character states were unique to a single taxon and  <dig> were phylogenetically-informative. six trees of  <dig> steps were obtained with consistency indices of  <dig>  with autapomorphies included and  <dig>  with autapomorphies excluded . ten nodes were common to the six shortest trees . eight of those ten nodes have bootstrap values  greater than  <dig>  but bs exceeded  <dig> for only three nodes.

to construct matrix  <dig> and matrix  <dig>  we interpreted endpoints as events where possible. under our interpretation, several types of rearrangements contributed to cpdna evolution in the family, including multiple inversions , five ir expansion or contraction events, eight transpositions, two deletions, and  <dig> large insertions greater than  <dig> kb in size . although transposition probably does occur, at least occasionally, in the chloroplast genome  <cit> , it is not a common mechanism of rearrangement. still, in some instances transposition could explain rearranged gene orders with fewer steps than multiple inversions and so we hypothesized transposition events in some cases. matrix  <dig> and  <dig> each were composed of  <dig> variable characters of which thirty-one and thirty-four, respectively, were parsimony informative.

the unweighted analysis of matrix  <dig> produced  <dig> equally parsimonious trees of  <dig> steps . the strict consensus of the  <dig> trees includes six resolved nodes  all six of which were supported by bs values of at least  <dig> and five nodes were supported at 90% or above. the weighted analysis of matrix  <dig>  resulted in  <dig> equally parsimonious trees of  <dig> steps . the strict consensus of the twelve trees retains ten resolved nodes. seven of the ten nodes have bs values over  <dig> and for five nodes bs ≥  <dig>  both analyses of matrix  <dig> generated the same two equally parsimonious trees . the lengths of the two trees were  <dig> steps  or  <dig> steps  depending on whether unweighted  or weighted  analyses were conducted. only three endpoint characters are homoplasious in the matrix  <dig> analyses . the strict consensus of these two trees retains nine resolved nodes, all nine of which are supported with bs ≥  <dig>  six  nodes received strong support .

all results  indicate that codonopsis, platycodon, and cyananthus are basal within the family. analyses on matrix  <dig> and  <dig> support a codonopsis + cyananthus sister group relationship and a monophyletic basal clade whereas the matrix  <dig> analysis supports a codonopsis + platycodon sister group and a paraphyletic basal grade. neither outcome is very well supported; the alternative scenarios each require only a single additional step in the other data set. within the fifteen derived taxa some of the relationships are not resolved or resolved but weakly supported. however, some groupings are well supported in all analyses. the south african taxa, merciera, prismatocarpus and roella, form a clade . wahlenbergia is the sister to these three taxa in all analyses with varying levels of support . other groupings include a symphyandra + edraianthus clade  and legousia + asyneuma + petromarula + triodanis .

the five analyses had somewhat different characteristics . for example, matrix  <dig> and matrix  <dig> analyses generated fewer equally-parsimonious trees than matrix  <dig>  the matrix  <dig> analyses resolved the most nodes. matrix  <dig> analyses exhibited the lowest amounts of homoplasy and supported the highest number of nodes bs ≥  <dig>  comparing all results, no nodes with high bootstrap values  were conflicted by other nodes of equally high value. however, there were three instances of incongruence involving nodes of lesser support – matrix  <dig> and  <dig> analyses supported campanula + adenophora, whereas matrix  <dig> supported adenophora + jasione; matrix  <dig> supported codonopsis + platycodon , whereas matrix  <dig> and  <dig> supported codonopsis + cyananthus ; and matrix  <dig> supported  the placement of cyananthus at the base of the derived clade, whereas matrix  <dig> and  <dig> analyses supported the monophyly of the basal group . one clade, legousia + asyneuma , was recovered only by the matrix  <dig> analysis within a clade not further resolved by the other gene order analyses.

*the its analysis includes  <dig> fewer taxa than the others

we included sequence data here mainly to allow for a comparison with gene order data in terms of phylogenetic utility. the rbcl data from the same eighteen taxa  provided  <dig> parsimony-informative characters that, when analyzed, yielded nine shortest equally-parsimonious trees of  <dig> steps . the strict consensus of the nine trees retained fourteen nodes , thirteen of which had bs ≥  <dig> and four of which were supported bs ≥  <dig>  the its data of eddie et al  <cit>  from taxa equivalent to fifteen of the eighteen mapped taxa  provided  <dig> parsimony-informative characters from which a single most parsimonious tree of  <dig> steps  was generated . the tree contains thirteen resolved nodes of which ten had bs ≥  <dig> and four had bs ≥  <dig>  the two sequence data sets had lower ci values than any of the gene order analyses and a higher percentage of homoplastic characters . the its data had especially high levels of homoplasy; the its data had a higher percentage of characters that change three or more times in excess than the matrix  <dig> analyses had for total homoplastic characters . in the matrix  <dig> analysis only three characters  are required to change more than once over the most parsimonious tree; each has one excess change. with the inclusion of the sequence-based analyses, there were additional instances of incongruence between weakly supported nodes: 1) the placement of musschia and jasione varies between the rbcl and its results ; 2) in both sequence-based trees, campanula and adenophora are separate lineages  basal to the legousia-asyneuma-triodanis-petromarula clade, whereas in the gene order analyses they are allied to symphyandra-edraianthus, and trachelium; 3) matrix  <dig> supports a legousia-asyneuma clade, whereas a legousia-triodanis clade occurs in the sequence-based trees; and 4) matrix  <dig> and its support a codonopsis-platycodon grouping within the basal clade, whereas rbcl and matrix  <dig> and  <dig> analyses support codonopsis-cyananathus. among these instances of disagreement between weakly supported nodes, there is no general pattern of disagreement between the sequence data and the gene order analyses. and among strongly supported nodes, again, there is complete agreement, among all analyses-sequence and gene order.

discussion
phylogenetic analysis of cpdna rearrangements
the relatively large number of gene order mutations that have occurred in the campanulaceae chloroplast genomes causes difficulties when interpreting their phylogenetic significance. the phylogenetic analysis of such a complex set of cpdna rearrangements within a group of plants is without precedent. the first problem was simply defining individual mutational events. although the ideal way to analyze rearrangement data is to determine presence or absence of specific events, in the campanulaceae, this was not possible in many cases given our present knowledge. where multiple overlapping rearrangements have occurred between genomes, the two specific endpoints that define a particular inversion may not be determinable. because of the inherent complexity of the data, we felt a new method of character analysis of the rearrangement data was warranted. our approach involved coding endpoints, along with more easily defined rearrangements, as characters for different cladistic analyses. endpoints were defined as two non-contiguous tobacco regions that are now adjacent in the genomes of one or more species.

using endpoints as characters is advantageous. it allows for the incorporation into the analysis of data that could not be used if only unambiguously interpreted events were included. however, using endpoints as characters has several drawbacks, including the inadvertent weighting of certain events over others. inversions necessarily produce two endpoints, and transpositions three, whereas gene losses and ir boundary changes produce a single endpoint. therefore inversions would be included twice and transpositions three times if scored as "independent" endpoints rather than events. plus, if both endpoints of an inversion are still intact in a genome, the inversion is scored twice, if only a single endpoint remains the inversion is counted only once, and if both endpoints have been lost  the inversion will not be included at all. this may represent a problem in the campanulaceae analyses because there appears to be a mixture of event types and at least some endpoint reuse  <cit> .

our inclusion of transposition as a possible mechanism for gene order mutation in the campanulaceae chloroplast genomes is problematic. definitive evidence supporting the occurrence of transposition in the plastid genome is lacking. transposition has been invoked to explain chloroplast dna rearrangements, for example in "subclover"  <cit>  and wheat  <cit> . in these cases, transposition has been supported using parsimony arguments  or using the existence of inverted- and direct-repeat sequence motifs near the boundaries of rearrangements  <cit> . in campanulaceae, some lines of evidence in addition to parsimony suggest the possibility of transposition as a mechanism. first, the abundance of rearrangement events within the family suggests some mechanism that facilitates gene order mutation; transposition is one such process. second, the segment of the genome defined by tobacco probes 53– <dig> is now located, in most of the derived taxa, within the inverted repeat. the region from which it has been removed appears otherwise undisturbed. in asyneuma, the 53– <dig> region has been secondarily removed from the ir and returned to near its original location leaving behind small portions of  <dig> and  <dig> in the ir, detectable using southern hybridization. in wahlenbergia, merciera, prismatocarpus and roella, the  <dig>   <dig> portion of the 53– <dig> block has moved from the ir back to the lsc. one explanation for the high level of rearrangement apparently associated with this segment is that the region contains a transposable element. third, a possible duplicative transposition is suggested  in trachelium  <cit>  and five other taxa  <cit> . in addition to a full-length  copy of the 23s rrna gene, a partial copy is located within ycf <dig>  transposition is one manner in which segments of dna can be both copied and moved within a genome. none of our data are definitive. the observed rearrangements could have taken place as the result of multiple inversions. therefore, it is important to note that if transposition is not active in the campanulaceae genome, our phylogenetic results will not be greatly affected. events coded in matrix  <dig> and  <dig> as single transpositions would be underweighted inversions if incorrectly interpreted. the fact that the analysis of matrix  <dig> yields results compatible with those of the matrices that include transpositions suggests that, if our interpretation is erroneous, it does not affect the phylogenetic conclusions.

our three methods of character scoring did yield largely compatible results in our analyses. relationships that were strongly supported in one analysis were found in all analyses. events make more desirable characters but they will only improve analyses if the postulated events are the correct ones. comparing analyses that include event interpretations with endpoint only analyses is one way to determine the phylogenetic effects of the hypotheses of events used. endpoint only analyses also allow studies that minimize a priori assumptions about the evolutionary events. it is possible that more complex evolutionary scenarios occurred, in which some inversions evolved in parallel, or in which similar gene orders resulted from a different set of inversions. the parsimony analyses may underestimate the number of inversions shared between primitive and advanced genera, because evidence of shared inversions may have been lost. although we have attempted to produce the simplest evolutionary schemes, it is very possible that longer, more complicated scenarios actually occurred, especially given that the campanulaceae seem predisposed to cpdna rearrangements. however, given the congruence of the results among our various analyses, we feel our phylogeny is a reasonable estimate of relationships within the family. elsewhere, we have analyzed a reduced subset of characters and taxa for the campanulaceae cpdna data set using endpoint scoring and constructing trees using breakpoint distances among other methods . other computational biologists have also used this reduced data matrix to test different methods of phylogeny reconstruction based on gene order data . these various studies produced trees that are largely congruent with those generated in this paper suggesting that the campanulaceae cpdna gene order data are providing a consistent estimate of phylogenetic relationships given any logical method of scoring and analysis. although the rearrangements in campanulaceae are complex, the phylogenetic utility of the gene order data is evident. in most previous examples of phylogenetic use of rearrangements the small number of events allowed for the circumscription of only very broad groups  <cit> . because there are so many rearrangements in the campanulaceae, smaller groups can be identified. this has resulted in the most highly resolved phylogeny as yet developed based entirely on cpdna rearrangements.

not only do these data support a well-resolved phylogeny but they provide robust support of several nodes. matrix  <dig> supports as many nodes at bs ≥  <dig> as its and more than rbcl. in matrix  <dig>  only three endpoint characters  are homoplastic, each changing one extra time over the tree. in contrast, within its,  <dig> characters  change three or more extra times over the tree, and  <dig> % of characters are homoplastic. presumably because of this high level of homoplasy, only two nodes are retained in the consensus of all its trees from the shortest to 1% longer, whereas seven nodes are retained in matrix  <dig> trees "to 1% longer" – the highest number of any of the analyses. matrix  <dig>  the matrix in which characters are most interpreted as mutational events, is especially strong in its performance, exceeding both sequence data sets in average bootstrap value per resolved node and ci . this suggests that the closer we can get to scoring the actual mutations the stronger gene order data will perform. although the endpoint only matrix provides useful insights on relationships, we would argue that the extent to which these gene order characters cannot recover the phylogeny is directly related to our ability to define individual mutational events.

phylogenetic implications of the rearrangement data
most traditional classifications of the campanulaceae are based mainly on capsule dehiscence and ovary position and arrangement. as kovanda  <cit>  and thulin  <cit>  recognized, classification of the campanulaceae based on capsule characters alone brings together otherwise radically different taxa. neither the campanuleae nor wahlenbergieae  are monophyletic based on cpdna rearrangements . likewise, no traditional classification  suggests that codonopsis, platycodon, and cyananthus are basal in the family as supported by both gene order and sequence data. takhtajan's system  <cit>  is something of an exception among traditional classifications; however, he suggested only cyananthus  as the most primitive member of the family, placing platycodon and codonopsis in other tribes .

in contrast, studies of pollen ultrastructure have indicated that platycodon, codonopsis, and cyananthus are basal members of campanulaceae  <cit> . these taxa have colpate to colporate apertures, whereas the remaining family members  have porate grains  <cit> . the evolutionary scheme based on pollen morphology presented by dunbar  <cit>  suggests that cyananthus  and codonopsis  are more closely related to each other than either is to platycodon , which is also supported by the gene order tree . thulin  <cit>  believed that pollen morphology should constitute a key part of any modern reassessment of relationships in the campanulaceae. he suggested that all taxa with elongated apertures should be removed from campanuleae and wahlenbergieae, and those with porate grains removed from schönland's platycodinae. following the removal of colpate and colporate taxa, campanuleae sensu schönland are comprised of northern hemisphere genera, whereas wahlenbergieae contain southern hemisphere taxa, with the exceptions of edraianthus and jasione . the gene order data indicate that the affinities of jasione and edraianthus lie with northern hemisphere species rather than with wahlenbergieae. the gene order data also are compatible with other available nucleotide data in addition to those reported here , a morphology-based cladistic study  <cit>  and are also largely congruent with a serological study of the campanulaceae  <cit> . although the gene order and serological studies differed somewhat in the taxa sampled, both included a group containing trachelium and campanula. they also agreed in the grouping of asyneuma and petromarula. the only discrepancy was in the placement of legousia; the serological study placed this genus basal to all others surveyed  <cit> .

the groups delimited by cpdna rearrangements also exhibit geographical integrity. wahlenbergia is primarily a southern hemisphere old world genus  <cit> ; w. gloriosa, mapped for this study, is australian  <cit> . roella, merciera, and prismatocarpus are all endemic to south africa  <cit> . the nine genera in the trachelium and legousia clades are primarily european to eurasian, although triodanis is endemic to north america and campanula has a few north american representatives  <cit> . musschia is endemic to the island of madeira  <cit> .

there has been considerable debate regarding the relationships among the four centers of taxonomic diversity of the campanulaceae: asia, europe , south africa, and western north america. bentham  <cit>  hypothesized a northern origin for campanulaceae but he did not specify a particular region. takhtajan  <cit>  suggested a basal position of the asian genus cyananthus. studies of pollen ultrastructure indicated that the asian genera codonopsis, cyananthus, and platycodon are basal members of the campanulaceae  <cit> . recent studies of the campanulales  <cit>  indicate that the order consists of several families, including the campanulaceae, cyphiaceae, cyphocarpaceae, lobeliaceae, nemacladaceae, and stylidaceae. several of these families are restricted to the southern hemisphere , implying that the southern hemisphere may be the ancestral area for the campanulaceae  <cit> . phylogenies based on rbcl sequence data position the campanulaceae sister to the north american family nemacladaceae  <cit> . our cpdna phylogeny based on genome rearrangements  provides strong support for the basal position of the three examined asian platycodonoid genera, suggesting that the early radiation of the family may have occurred in asia rather than africa. the genera from the southern hemisphere  are in a much more derived position in the cpdna tree.

in addition, the gene order data suggest affinities of several controversial genera . schönland  <cit>  united musschia and platycodon as platycodinae, clearly incompatible with both our results and pollen evidence. musschia is placed in the derived clade , although its exact placement varies among all the analyses, including rbcl and its. de candolle  <cit>  was unsure of merciera's taxonomic position because its four basal ovules and single-seeded  unilocular capsule  <cit>  are unique in the campanulaceae  <cit> . this genus was later recognized as a separate tribe, merciereae  <cit> , but is allied with other southern african genera in the cpdna analysis . takhtajan  <cit>  placed merciera with wahlenbergia, roella and prismatocarpus in his wahlenbergieae but also included other genera forming a polyphyletic group according to our results.

adenophora and symphyandra have been segregated from campanula based on the presence of a conspicuous tubular nectariferous disc and connate anthers, respectively. adenophora and campanula are sister taxa in the gene order analyses  and adenophora's chloroplast genome is derived relative to campanula's . further sampling within adenophora and the large genus campanula will be necessary to determine if this is a general result. symphyandra is more closely related to edraianthus than campanula but all are within the a <dig> clade . edraianthus has traditionally been considered close to wahlenbergia  <cit>  but this is not supported by any of the results reported here or by morphological studies of hilliard and burtt  <cit> .

much controversy surrounds the taxonomy of the genera triodanis and legousia. in some treatments, both genera were included under the illegitimate name specularia . mcvaugh  <cit>  and fernald  <cit>  disagreed regarding the circumscription of the genera; fernald felt that triodanis as a genus is very weak and should be merged with legousia. mcvaugh  <cit>  argued that the two genera should either remain separate or both be subsumed into campanula. in his system, both species studied here  belong to triodanis. as expected, triodanis and legousia belong to the same cpdna clade , united by an unusual mutation that transferred a large segment of the large single copy  region to the ssc region  <cit> . however, legousia has a putative transposition not found in triodanis, whereas triodanis has a unique large insertion  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
despite the difficulties in interpreting such a complex set of rearrangements, the systematic utility of chloroplast dna in the campanulaceae is evident. our results support the division of the family into two groups previously unrecognized in any taxonomic treatment. in addition, numerous groupings within the larger, derived clade are strongly supported. the data indicate that traditional classifications based on fruit and ovary characters are unnatural, and suggest affinities of several difficult genera. additional sampling within large genera, such as campanula and wahlenbergia, will be necessary to fully elucidate relationships among chloroplast genomes. it is likely that intrafamilial relationships can be further resolved by including other genera in rearrangement analyses. although homoplasy is not absent in our data, it is low and considerably lower than some sequence data such as its. although any reasonable scoring method for the gene order data generates results that are largely compatible among the different analyses, the more that the gene order data can be interpreted as actual mutational events  the stronger will be the results. even in cases such as this, with high levels of gene order complexity, cpdna gene order mutations make excellent phylogenetic markers.
