BACKGROUND
lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide, accounting for approximately 28% of all cancer deaths annually. the prognosis for lung cancer is poor. most lung cancer patients are diagnosed at advanced stage and only 16% remained surviving 5 years after initial diagnosis. out of all lung cancer cases, about 85–90% of diagnosis are non-small cell lung cancer   <cit> . nsclc consists of three major tumor subtypes: adenocarcinoma, large-cell carcinoma and squamous-cell carcinoma. therapeutic regimens are platinum-based doublets, whereby the second agent can be microtubule-targeted agents, cytidine analogues or dna-damaging agents  <cit> . cytotoxic chemotherapy thus remains as the current standard cure for patients having advanced nsclc.

gemcitabine, a cytidine analogue, is well-known to have a significant therapeutic effect in nsclc cases  <cit> . it is a prodrug that becomes activated by intracellular kinases to form di- and tri-phosphorylated metabolites, which together catalyze the conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides and terminate dna synthesis  <cit> . studies have shown that the responses of nsclc patients to gemcitabine treatment vary, which could be due to genetic polymorphisms and different gene variants involved in the gemcitabine pathway  <cit> .

the eukaryotic dna polymerase α, one of the main polymerases involved in nuclear dna replication, is a four-subunit  enzyme which possesses dna polymerase and primase activities. earlier biochemical studies have reported that subunit a displays catalytic activity, while subunits c and d exhibit primase activity  <cit> . subunit b, also known as dna polymerase α <dig> accessory subunit , is a 70-kda regulatory subunit which contributes to dna replication by binding the dna polymerase α-primase complex to the initiation and elongation machinery  <cit> . pola <dig> is widely expressed in a variety of tissue types. it has recently been shown to participate in gene fusion events and may also act as a prognostic biomarker in ovarian cancer and gastrointestinal stromal tumors  <cit> . however, the exact role of pola <dig> in human cancer remains unknown and its involvement in nsclc pathogenesis remains understudied.

we have previously demonstrated that pola2 +  <dig> gg/ga improves differential survivability and mortality in nsclc patients, and proposed that this novel single nucleotide polymorphism  may be used as a prognostic biomarker of patient outcome in nsclc pathogenesis  <cit> . in the current study, we sought to determine the association between pola <dig> and gemcitabine treatment, and further characterized the role of pola <dig> in human lung cancer cells.

RESULTS

effect of gemcitabine on human lung cancer cell lines
to examine the effect of gemcitabine on human lung cancer cell lines, we treated pc <dig>  h <dig> and h <dig> cell lines with  <dig> –100 μm gemcitabine for 72 h. as shown in fig.  <dig>  cell viability decreased with increasing concentrations of gemcitabine treatment. although all  <dig> cell lines showed similar trends of decreasing cell viability upon gemcitabine treatment, h <dig> was found to be the most sensitive to gemcitabine, having the lowest ic <dig> among the  <dig> cell lines studied.fig.  <dig> effect of gemcitabine on human lung cancer cell lines. human lung cancer cell lines, namely pc <dig>  h <dig> and h <dig>  were treated with  <dig> –100 μm gemcitabine for up to 72 h. untreated cells  were used as the control. all experiments were conducted in triplicates and repeated at least  <dig> times. data are shown as the mean ± sd. dotted line indicates 50% cell viability




detection of snps in human lung cancer cell lines
the pola +  <dig> gg/ga snp and slc28a2 +  <dig> cc snp are two of the  <dig> snps of the  <dig> genes involved in gemcitabine transport, metabolism and activity. from our in silico prediction analysis reported earlier  <cit> , these two snps gave the best survival outcome and thus of interest for further studies in vitro. here, sequencing of pc <dig>  h <dig> and h <dig> cell lines revealed that all of these cell lines harboured the wild-type pola2 +  <dig> snp , indicating that the pola2 +  <dig> snp might not be responsible for gemcitabine sensitivity in the cell lines studied. next, to investigate if slc28a2 +  <dig> snp might be involved in gemcitabine sensitivity, we sequenced pc <dig>  h <dig> and h <dig> cell lines for the slc28a2 +  <dig> snp. as shown in fig. 3b, only h <dig> cell line harboured the mutation slc28a2 +  <dig> cc > ct snp, whereas both pc <dig> and h <dig> cell lines contained the wild-type slc28a2 +  <dig> cc snp. we therefore selected h <dig> and h <dig> cell lines for subsequent experiments.fig.  <dig> detection of snps in human lung cancer cell lines. sequencing plots of h <dig>  pc <dig> and h <dig> cell lines for  pola2 +  <dig> snp and  slc28a +  <dig> snp. all  <dig> cell lines harboured the wild-type pola2 +  <dig> gg snp. only h <dig> harboured the mutation slc28a +  <dig> cc > ct snp, while both pc <dig> and h <dig> contained the wild-type slc28a +  <dig> cc snp




knockdown of pola <dig> gene increased resistance to gemcitabine treatment
both h <dig> and h <dig> cell lines were transfected for 48–72 h with the respective small interfering rnas  to silence pola <dig> and slc28a <dig> genes. however, h <dig> cell line could not be successfully transfected , hence only the h <dig> cell line was used for further studies. western blot analysis showed that pola <dig> protein expression was significantly attenuated after 72 h of transfection . a chemosensitivity assay was then conducted to determine the effect of pola <dig> knockdown on the drug sensitivity of h <dig> cell line to gemcitabine. as shown in fig. 4b, h <dig> cell line became more resistant to gemcitabine upon knockdown of the pola <dig> gene. this implied that other factors and mechanisms might play a role in contributing to gemcitabine resistance and more work needs to be done to explore this avenue.fig.  <dig> effects of pola <dig> gene silencing. a protein expression after knockdown of pola <dig> by sirna. comparison of pola <dig> protein expression in h <dig> cell line by western blotting after  <dig> and 72 h of sirna transfection. internal control for equal loading: glyceraldeyde phosphate dehydrogenase . b chemosensitivity assay by comparing ic <dig> values before and after knockdown of pola <dig>  results indicated that the h <dig> cell line became more resistant to gemcitabine treatment after sirna knockdown of pola <dig> , as compared to the non-transfected h <dig> cell line having wild-type pola <dig> . experiments were conducted in triplicates and repeated at least  <dig> times. data are shown as the mean ± sd 




discussion
previously, we have demonstrated that the pola2 +  <dig> gg/ga snp is associated with improved survivability and mortality in nsclc patients  <cit> . in this current study, we reported that the response to gemcitabine treatment is related to pola <dig> and confirmed that the knockdown of pola <dig> gene increased the resistance to gemcitabine treatment in human lung cancer cells.

nsclc is one of the most chemoresistant cancer types. clinical treatment using traditional chemotherapy agents have reached a plateau in nsclc patients due to resistance to chemotherapy drugs. molecular targeted therapy through interruption of the epithelial growth factor receptor was one of the earlier treatment strategies used  <cit> . however, this strategy failed to achieve remarkable results during clinical trials  <cit> . many factors, including genetic heterogeneity, redundant tumor growth as well as survival signaling pathways, likely contributed to the resistance of nsclc patients to molecular therapies  <cit> . as such, genetic studies and the understanding of signaling mechanisms may help to identify appropriate treatment strategies for nsclc patients.

the dna polymerase α subunit b, which is involved in the initiation of chromosomal dna replication, is encoded by the pola <dig> gene. we have previously reported that different variants of the pola <dig> gene may improve the prognosis of nsclc patients  <cit> . we have demonstrated that the pola2 +  <dig> gg/ga snp encodes for a mutant dna polymerase α subunit b that is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. this leads to an inhibition in nuclear dna polymerase α activity, thereby conferring a protective effect on nsclc patients due to termination of tumor dna replication. this inhibition of tumor cell proliferation ultimately results in tumor cell death.

gemcitabine is a potent dna synthesis inhibitor, which is a deoxycytidine analogue with anti-tumor activity against various solid tumours such as nsclc, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer and ovarian cancer  <cit> . gemcitabine enters the cell through transport by members of the nucleoside transporter family slc <dig> and slc <dig>  <cit> . it is then activated by the deoxycytidine kinase to its monophosphate form in a rate-limiting step. the monophosphate form is then further phosphorylated into gemcitabine triphosphate, which is then incorporated into the dna by dna polymerase α. through a process of masked chain termination, dna synthesis and repair are prematurely halted  <cit> . as gemcitabine is involved in the inhibition of dna synthesis, it is a suitable drug candidate for studying the role of pola <dig> 

one important aspect of genetic studies is the interactions between snps. in a study of snp-snp interactions, a small number of snps is genotyped and then tested if any interactions are present. such snp-snp interaction studies may help to identify genomic hotspots in human diseases. the possibility of using statistical modeling by many types of regression techniques with straightforward implementation of interaction analysis is also an additional advantage of snp-snp interaction studies. we have applied biostatistics to calculate the probability between different snp pairs and their overall association to the survival of lung cancer patients  <cit> . from in silico prediction using statistics, we found that pola2 +  <dig> gg/ga snp together with slc28a2 +  <dig> cc snp were associated with increased median survival. here, in this study, we validated these statistical findings through wet-lab experiments. we hypothesised that having the pola +  <dig> gg/ga snp would cause a tumor to be more sensitive to gemcitabine treatment. by performing drug sensitivity tests and sequencing the dna of human lung cancer cells for the snp sites of interest, we were able to monitor whether the presence of pola +  <dig> gg/ga snp could affect the response to gemcitabine treatment. our results showed that all cell lines contained the wild-type pola <dig> gene. we then proceeded to silence the pola <dig> gene by sirna transfection and found that instead of causing tumor cell death due to termination of dna replication, the cell lines became more resistant to gemcitabine treatment. this is the first report to suggest that the pola <dig> gene does not act alone but may cooperate with other genes to cause drug resistance to gemcitabine. indeed, we showed through in silico prediction that several interacting partners of pola <dig> exist. our findings are concomitant with those recently reported by kang et al.  <cit> , who showed that pola <dig> participates in gene fusion events and may act as a prognostic biomarker in gastrointestinal stromal tumors.

earlier studies have reported other genes that caused resistance to gemcitabine treatment. davidson et al.  <cit>  proposed that increased expression of the ribonucleotide reductase catalytic subunit m <dig>  gene results in increased resistance to gemcitabine, while oguri et al.  <cit>  reported that decreased expression of the multidrug resistance protein  <dig>  gene leads to an increase in gemcitabine sensitivity. in addition, studies by rha et al.  <cit>  showed that patients with the rrm <dig> haplotypes  <dig> a > g and 2464 g > a tend to be genetically more resistant to gemcitabine. collectively, these studies showed that resistance to gemcitabine are multifactorial, which involves decreased intracellular accumulation and alteration of metabolism  <cit> . similar factors include increased gemcitabine degradation enzymes, decreased gemcitabine regulation enzymes and decreased activity of nucleoside transporters   <cit> . other factors such as activation of dna repair pathways, negative regulation of apoptosis, alterations in cell cycle and cell proliferation pathways, and transition to a more epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition -like phenotype can also lead to an increased resistance to gemcitabine treatment.

our findings showed that pola <dig> may be a novel gene that causes resistance to gemcitabine. similar to the rrm <dig> gene, pola <dig> is involved in dna synthesis and hence, a decrease in its expression might cause the up-regulation of genes that play a role in dna synthesis and repair. these genes and their polymorphisms should be studied to determine whether there are any snp-snp interactions present among them, as well as with the pola <dig> gene, that could have led to gemcitabine resistance. van de wiel et al.  <cit>  reported chromosomal aberrations as detected by microarray analysis. genomewide gene expression and snp microarray analyses may further reveal information on signaling mechanisms and pathways leading to acquired gemcitabine resistance. we are currently exploring this area to study which genes are deregulated, leading to drug resistance. studying the gene expression and polymorphisms of nucleoside transporters and genes involved in dna synthesis and repair can also help to predict chemosensitivity.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our findings suggested that pola <dig> may play a role in gemcitabine resistance. this has important implications as patients with certain variants of the pola <dig> gene may be resistant to gemcitabine and may not survive well on gemcitabine treatment. we propose that pola <dig> may be used as a prognostic biomarker of patient outcome in nsclc pathogenesis. more work needs to be done to characterize the correlation between pola <dig> and gemcitabine resistance. functions of the pola2 +  <dig> gg/ga snp should also be further studied to determine its role in drug resistance and sensitivity. our earlier report suggested that the presence of slc28a2 +  <dig> cc/ct snp may increase the sensitivity to gemcitabine and thus giving nsclc patients a better prognosis  <cit> . however, as shown in fig.  <dig> in our current study, slc28a2 +  <dig> cc snp has not been proven to be an interactant of pola <dig>  therefore, more studies are needed to investigate whether slc28a2 +  <dig> cc/ct snp is associated with a better response to gemcitabine treatment and whether this slc28a2 +  <dig> cc/ct snp indeed interacts with the pola2 +  <dig> gg/ga snp. a larger panel of cell lines carrying either or both snps needs to be screened to obtain a more comprehensive overview and we are currently working on this aspect.
