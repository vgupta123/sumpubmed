BACKGROUND
diarrhoeal diseases have been and continue to be a cause of mortality and morbidity, especially in developing countries. of particular note is the disease cholera, a severe watery diarrhoeal disease caused by vibrio cholerae. v. cholerae is a diverse species of gram negative bacilli. serological testing has enabled strains of v. cholerae to be divided into over  <dig> serogroups based on the o-antigen present  <cit> . however, only the o <dig> and o <dig> serogroups have been known to cause pandemic and epidemic level disease  <cit> .

since  <dig>  seven pandemics of cholera have been recorded  <cit> . the ongoing epidemic started in  <dig> and has affected almost every continent, particularly countries of southeast asia, africa, and south america. cholera remains endemic in developing countries and outbreaks still pose a significant public health issue  <cit> .

the developments of dna based typing methods have allowed epidemiological studies of cholera. methods such as pulse field gel electrophoresis  <cit> , amplified fragment length polymorphism  <cit>  as well as population structure studies including multi-locus sequence typing  <cit>  have all been applied to v. cholerae isolates. such methods have all been able to distinguish between environmental and clinical strains of v. cholerae <cit> , but they have had limited success in drawing evolutionary relationships between 7th pandemic strains. previously, we investigated the evolution of v. cholerae using single nucleotide polymorphism  analysis and found that 7th pandemic v. cholerae isolates could be distinguished into groups with a stepwise accumulation of snps. the 7th pandemic snp relationships were confirmed by a large genome sequencing based study by mutreja et al.  <cit> . snp groups were correlated with the spread of pandemic cholera into africa and were also able to separate the o <dig> isolates into a distinct snp profile  <cit> . however, further resolution of isolates within each group is required.

multilocus variable number tandem repeat analysis  is a pcr based typing method based on regions of tandemly repeated short dna sequence elements. variations in the number of copies of repeat dna sequences form the basis of differentiation  <cit> . recent studies have shown that mlva is a highly discriminating method for the typing of environmental and clinical isolates of v. cholerae and is able to differentiate closely related isolates from outbreak situations  <cit> . in this report, we applied mlva to isolates spanning the 7th pandemic to further determine the genetic and evolutionary relationships within the 7th pandemic clone and to evaluate the potential of mlva as a long term epidemiological typing tool.

RESULTS
vntr variation and discriminative power
the mlva data of  <dig> 7th pandemic isolates including its o <dig> derivative and  <dig> genome sequenced strains from grim et al. <cit>  are presented as repeat numbers for each locus . additionally,  <dig> pre-7th pandemic isolates were included for comparison but were excluded from the calculation of diversity statistics below. the  <dig> 7th pandemic isolates were distinguished into  <dig> mlva profiles. all mlva profiles were represented by a single isolate except for  <dig> mlva profiles that were represented by  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> isolates respectively. two of these profiles belonged to snp group ii and had allelic profile of 9-6-4-7-26- <dig> and 9-6-4-7-25- <dig>  note that an mlva profile is made up of the repeat numbers for the following loci : vc <dig>  vc <dig>  vc <dig>  vc <dig>  vca <dig> and vca <dig>  the remaining profiles were within snp group vi and differed at vca <dig> by only one repeat, with the profiles 10-7-3-9-- <dig> 

*mlva profile is made up of the repeat numbers  for the following vntr loci : vc <dig>  vc <dig>  vc <dig>  vc <dig>  vca <dig> and vca <dig> 

$pre-7th: pre-seventh pandemic isolates. all other isolates are 7th pandemic  or its derivative o <dig>  isolates. the roman numerals  denote snp groups as described in lam et al.  <cit> .

†data for these strains were from published genome sequences. note that no vntr data for the recently sequenced haitian isolates and peru isolate c <dig> 

the level of variation differed across the six vntrs analysed. in total,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> alleles were observed for vc <dig>  vc <dig>  vc <dig>  vc <dig>  vca <dig> and vca <dig> respectively. it is also interesting to note that the  <dig> most variable vntrs are located in the small chromosome while the other  <dig> less variable vntrs are on the large chromosome. additionally, one isolate  amplified two products that differed by one repeat for vc <dig> which has been observed previously  <cit> . however, for phylogenetic analysis and scoring of alleles, only the fragment with the strongest signal was recorded. this vntr is located within the cholera toxin subunit a promoter region which may have contributed to the decreased variation  <cit> .

the discriminatory power of each vntr and all  <dig> vntrs combined was measured by simpson’s index of diversity . the highest d value was  <dig>  and was recorded for vca <dig>  except for vca <dig> and vca <dig>  all d values were lower than previously reported. our focus on 7th pandemic isolates which have been shown to be highly homogeneous may have contributed to these lower d values. vntr vc <dig> had the lowest d value of  <dig> , which was lower than previously reported   <cit> . the combined d value of 7th pandemic isolates for all  <dig> vntrs in this study was  <dig> . we also calculated d values from previous studies by excluding mlva data of environmental and non-7th pandemic isolates  <cit>  and found that the d values were similar and ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>   <cit> , when only 7th pandemic isolates were analysed. analysis using the two most variable vntrs, vca <dig> and vca <dig>  produced comparable d values, which could potentially reduce the need to use the other markers. this would be particularly useful in outbreak situations where there is limited time and resources available to type isolates. however, typing the isolates in this study using only two loci would not reveal any useful relationships.

phylogenetic analysis using mlva
we analysed the mlva using eburst  <cit> . using the criteria of  <dig> out of  <dig> loci identical as definition of a clonal complex,  <dig> mlva profiles were grouped into  <dig> clonal complexes with  <dig> singletons. for the  <dig> clonal complexes, a minimal spanning network  was constructed to show the relationships of the mlva profiles . many nodes in the  <dig> largest clonal complexes showed multiple alternative connections. there were  <dig> possible nodes differing by  <dig> locus,  <dig> nodes were due to the difference in vc <dig> and  <dig> others were due to vntr loci in chromosome ii. out of the  <dig> single locus difference in the  <dig> chromosome ii vntrs, the majority  also differed by gain or loss of a single repeat unit. thus  <dig> repeat change was the most frequent for the vntrs on both chromosomes. it has been shown previously that it is more likely for a vntr locus to differ by the gain or loss of a single repeat unit as seen in e. coli <cit>  and we have also found this was the case in v. cholerae. we then used the mlva data for all 7th pandemic isolates to construct a minimal spanning tree . for nodes where alternative connections of equal minimal distance were present we selected the connection with priority rules in the order of: between nodes within the same snp group, between nodes differing by  <dig> repeat difference and between nodes by closest geographical or temporal proximity. the majority of isolates differed by either  <dig> or  <dig> loci, which is attributable to vca <dig> and vca <dig> being the  <dig> most variable loci. it should be noted that node connections differing by more than one vntr locus are less reliable as there were more alternatives.

since the  <dig> vntrs on chromosome ii were highly variable, exclusion of these  <dig> vntrs may increase the reliability of the minimum spanning tree mst . the number of unique mlva profiles was reduced from  <dig> to  <dig>  nine profiles had multiple isolates, of which  <dig> contained isolates from  <dig> different snp groups. eburst analysis showed that using only the  <dig> chromosome i vntr loci, the majority of the 4-loci mlva profiles were grouped together as one clonal complex with one locus difference. two mlva profiles  were singletons and another  <dig>  formed a clonal complex by themselves. out of  <dig> nodes connected by  <dig> locus difference, the repeat unit differed by the gain or loss of  <dig> to  <dig> repeats. the majority  differed by a single repeat unit, followed by  <dig> and  <dig> units with  <dig> and  <dig> events respectively. gain or loss of  <dig> and  <dig> repeats were only seen in one node each. the msn for the larger clonal complex showed many alternative connections of the nodes . using the same principle as above to resolve alternative nodes with equal minimum distance, an mst was constructed to display the relationships of these mlva profiles and the  <dig> more distantly related mlva profiles as shown in additional file  <dig> figure s1b.

a previous snp analysis with the same isolates had shown that 7th pandemic cholera had undergone stepwise evolution  <cit> . none of these groups were clearly distinct from the either the  <dig> loci or  <dig> loci mlva mst aside from snp group vi which consists of o <dig> isolates . however, a distinctive pattern can be seen when the consensus alleles within a snp group are compared as shown in table  <dig>  we allocated a consensus allele if more than half of the mlva profiles carried a given allele in the snp group and if there was no consensus, the consensus allele was represented by an x for discussion below. the  <dig> most variable vntrs  had no consensus alleles within any of the snp groups except vca <dig> in group vi. the allelic profile that initiated the 7th pandemic was likely to be 8-6-4-7-x-x based on the allelic profiles of the prepandemic stains which is also consistent with the profile of the earliest 7th pandemic isolate m <dig> from indonesia. group i had an 8-6-4-7-x-x allelic profile which evolved into 9-6-4-7-x-x in group ii. by changing the 2nd vntr allele from  <dig> to  <dig>  groups iii and iv had consensus profiles of 9-7-4-7-x-x and 9-7-4-x-20-x respectively, with the latter being most likely a 9-7-4-8-20-x profile . group v had the first vntr allele reverted back to  <dig> and had an 8-7-4-8-x-x profile. snp group vi showed the most allele changes with a 10-7-3-9-23-x profile compared with  <dig>   <dig> -,  <dig>  21/ <dig>  23/ <dig> from stine et al. <cit> . although vca <dig> and vca <dig> offered no group consensus alleles, it is interesting to note that the trend for vca <dig> increased in the number of repeats while vca <dig> decreased in the number of repeats over time . each snp group was most likely to have arisen once with a single mlva type as the founder, identical vntr alleles between snp groups are most likely due to reverse/parallel changes. this has also contributed to the inability of mlva to resolve relationships. the comparison of the snp and mlva data allowed us to see the reverse/parallel changes of vntr alleles within known genetically related groups. however, the rate of such changes is difficult to quantitate with the current data set.

in order to resolve isolates within the established snp groups of the 7th pandemic, all  <dig> vntr loci were used to construct a mst for each snp profile containing more than  <dig> isolates. six separate msts were constructed and assigned to their respective snp profiles as shown in figure  <dig>  the largest vntr difference within a snp group was  <dig> loci which was seen between two sequenced strains, cirs <dig> and b <dig>  in contrast, there were several sets of mlva profiles which differed by only one vntr locus within the msts which showed that they were most closely related. the first set consisted of  <dig> mlva profiles of six isolates within snp group ii, all of which were the earlier african isolates. the root of group ii was m <dig>  an ethiopian isolate from  <dig> which was consistent with previous results using aflp  <cit>  and snps  <cit> . however, the later african and latin american isolates were not clearly resolved. we previously proposed that latin american cholera originated from africa based on snp analysis, which was further supported by the clustering of recently sequenced strain c <dig> from peru  <cit> . note that c <dig> is not on figure  <dig> as we cannot extract vntr data from the incomplete genome sequence. m <dig> and m <dig> from peru and french guiana were the most closely related, with  <dig> vntr differences, however the remainder of isolates in this subgroup were more diverse than earlier isolates. the second set of mlva profiles differing by one locus consisted of all o <dig> isolates in snp group vi except m <dig>  which was separated by two vntr loci. this finding is similar to a study by ghosh et al.  <cit> , who found that isolates collected within a year differed at only one locus, while isolates from later years differed at more than one locus. a similar trend was also seen between closely related samples taken from the same household or same individual  <cit> .

isolates from snp group v were collected from thailand and  <dig> regions of africa and contained  <dig> genome sequences, mj- <dig>  b <dig> and cirs <dig>  from mozambique and bangladesh  <cit> . these isolates were shown to be identical based on  <dig> snps  <cit> . the genetic relatedness of these isolates was also reflected by their mlva profiles, which differ by only  <dig> loci. the consensus alleles for snp group v was  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  x, x, which was identical to the consensus alleles of mlva group i  according to a 5-loci study by choi et al. <cit> .

no other consensus alleles of mlva groups matched the current snp group consensus alleles. however, there were  <dig> isolates from africa  with the profiles  <dig>   <dig>  -, 7/ <dig>  x, x from this study, which matched  <dig> mlva profiles of isolates from mlva group iii vietnam from choi et al. <cit> . these african isolates were collected in  <dig> and  <dig> while isolates from choi et al. <cit>  were collected between 2002– <dig>  it is unlikely that the isolates from these two studies are epidemiologically linked. this further highlights the need for snp analysis to resolve evolutionary relationships before mlva can be applied for further differentiation.

based on a 5-loci mlva study performed by ali et al. <cit>  the ancestral profile of the  <dig> haitian outbreak isolates was determined to be  <dig>   <dig>  -,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  nine mlva profiles differing by  <dig> locus were found in total and were mapped against our snp study. a previous study showed that  <dig> haitian cholera outbreak strain belong to snp group v  <cit> . however, based on the ancestral profile of the haitian isolates, only the first locus was shared with our group v consensus allele and no other haitian alleles were found in any of the group v isolates. thus, no relationships could be made between group v isolates and the haitian outbreak strains. similarly, in another 5-loci mlva study of 7th pandemic isolates sampled from  <dig> to  <dig> in bangladesh  <cit> , no mlva profiles were found to be identical at more than  <dig> loci to our mlva profiles. therefore, while mlva may be highly discriminatory, it may not be reliable for longer term epidemiology and evolutionary relationships. our studies of salmonella enterica serovar typhi also reached a similar conclusion  <cit> . however, it should be noted that although our isolates are representative of the spread of the 7th cholera pandemic, our sample size is relatively small. a study with a much larger sample may be useful to affirm this conclusion.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that mlva of  <dig> vntr loci is highly discriminatory in differentiating closely related 7th pandemic isolates and shown that snp groups share consensus vntr patterns. we have also shown that relationships among isolates can only be inferred if they differ by  <dig> to  <dig> vntrs. mlva is best used for outbreak investigations or tracing the source of outbreaks, such as the recent outbreak in haiti  <cit> . the advantage of mlva is that there is no phylogenetic discovery bias as is the case with snps  <cit> . however, vntrs alone are too variable to be used for longer term epidemiological studies as they were unable to resolve relationships of the isolates over a  <dig> year span. mlva needs to be used in combination with snps for evolutionary or longer term epidemiological studies. the snp and mlva analyses of the haitian outbreak and its possible nepal origin illustrate well the usefulness of this approach  <cit> .
