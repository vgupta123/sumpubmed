BACKGROUND
helicobacter pylori is a gram-negative spiral-shaped bacterium that persistently colonizes the human stomach  <cit> . persistent h. pylori colonization of the human stomach is a risk factor for several diseases, including non-cardia gastric adenocarcinoma, gastric lymphoma, and peptic ulceration  <cit> . the incidence of these diseases varies considerably throughout the world. for example, the incidence of gastric adenocarcinoma is substantially higher in east asia, central america, and south america than in most other parts of the world  <cit> .

h. pylori isolates from unrelated humans exhibit a high level of genetic diversity  <cit> . genetic variation is readily detectable by analyzing the nucleotide sequences of individual genes in different h. pylori strains  <cit> . h. pylori allelic diversity is probably the consequence of multiple factors, including a high rate of mutation, a high rate of intraspecies genetic recombination, and a long evolutionary history of the species  <cit> . corresponding alleles in different h. pylori strains typically are  <dig> to 99% identical in nucleotide sequences  <cit> , but several h. pylori genes exhibit a much higher level of genetic diversity  <cit> .

further analyses have shown that there is geographic variation among h. pylori strains  <cit> . based on multilocus sequence analysis of a panel of  <dig> h. pylori strains isolated from humans in different parts of the world, seven populations of strains with distinct geographic distributions have been identified  <cit> . these h. pylori populations reflect the migration of humans from africa to other parts of the world over a time period estimated to be approximately  <dig>  years  <cit> . geographic differences among h. pylori strains could potentially be a factor that helps to explain the varying incidence of h. pylori-associated diseases in various parts of the world.

in addition to variation among h. pylori strains in the sequences of individual genes, there is considerable variation among strains in gene content. one study analyzed genomic dna from  <dig> different h. pylori strains using array hybridization methods and identified  <dig> genes that were present in all of the strains tested   <cit> . among  <dig> genes analyzed, 25% were absent from at least one of the  <dig> h. pylori strains. it was predicted that the h. pylori core genome would consist of  <dig>  genes if a much larger set of isolates were tested  <cit> . other studies have reported the existence of core genomes comprising  <dig> or  <dig> genes, based on dna array analysis of  <dig> or  <dig> h. pylori strains, respectively  <cit> . one study reported that the phylogeny of h. pylori strains based on mlst analysis was substantially different from the phylogeny of h. pylori strains based on analysis of gene content  <cit> .

one of the most striking differences in gene content among h. pylori strains is the presence or absence of a 40-kb region of chromosomal dna known as the cag pathogenicity island   <cit> . in the united states and europe, about 50â€“60% of h. pylori strains contain the cag pai and the remaining strains lack this region of the chromosome  <cit> . in many other parts of the world, including east asia, nearly all h. pylori strains contain the cag pai  <cit> . the h. pylori cag pai encodes an effector protein, caga, and a type iv secretion apparatus that translocates caga into gastric epithelial cells  <cit> . h. pylori strains harboring the cag pai are associated with an increased risk of non-cardia gastric cancer or peptic ulcer disease compared to strains that lack the cag pai  <cit> . the correlation between these diseases and presence of the cag pai provides an example of how the clinical outcome of h. pylori infection is determined in part by genetic characteristics of the strains with which a person is infected.

in previous studies, the complete genomes of three h. pylori strains have been analyzed  <cit> . these three h. pylori strains were isolated from patients who had gastritis, atrophic gastritis, or duodenal ulcer disease. in the current study, we sought to analyze genetic features of h. pylori strains isolated from patients with two different h. pylori-associated diseases: gastric ulcer and gastric cancer. for this analysis, we selected a gastric ulcer strain  that readily colonizes the stomachs of mice and mongolian gerbils. this strain is of particular interest because an animal-passaged derivative of strain b <dig>  causes gastric cancer in a mongolian gerbil model  <cit> . for an analysis of a gastric cancer-associated h. pylori strain, we selected strain 98- <dig>  which was isolated from a gastric cancer patient in japan  <cit> , a country with a very high incidence of gastric cancer  <cit> .

RESULTS
general features of h. pylori genomes
prior to the current study, the complete genome sequences of h. pylori strains isolated from patients with superficial gastritis, atrophic gastritis, or duodenal ulcer disease had been reported  <cit> . in the current study, we analyzed the genome sequences of an h. pylori strain  that was isolated from a patient with gastric cancer  <cit>  and a strain  that was isolated from a patient with gastric ulcer disease  <cit> . general features of the two genomes analyzed in the current study in comparison to three previously sequenced genomes are summarized in table  <dig>  to identify transposable genetic elements that might be present in the two newly sequenced genomes, the nucleotide sequences of each genome were used as queries to search an insertion sequence database . strain 98- <dig> contained orfs  homologous to orfs found in is <dig>   <cit> . strain b <dig> contained orfs  homologous to orfs found in ishp <dig> , but nucleotide insertions are predicted to disrupt the transposase gene in strain b <dig>  <cit> . is <dig> and ishp <dig> are not present in any of the three h. pylori strains for which genome sequences were previously available. a previous study reported that is <dig> was detected in about 20% of h. pylori strains  <cit> . ishp <dig> is nonrandomly distributed geographically among h. pylori strains, and this element was reported to be more abundant in strains from peruvian patients with gastric cancer than in strains from peruvian patients with gastritis only  <cit> .

mlst analysis of h. pylori strains
in previous studies, mlst analysis has been used to classify h. pylori isolates into several haplogroups that have distinct geographic distributions  <cit> . to assign the two newly sequenced h. pylori strains to one of the previously described population clusters, we compared eight gene sequences from each strain to the corresponding sequences of  <dig> other h. pylori isolates, using an mlst database as described in the methods. based on this analysis, strain 98- <dig> was classified as a member of the east asian population cluster and strain b <dig> was classified as a member of the european population cluster. a neighbor-joining tree depicting relationships of the two newly sequenced strains to representative reference strains isolated from diverse geographic locations is shown in figure  <dig>  the clustering depicted on this neighbor-joining tree accurately reflects the geographic origins of the reference strains, and is in agreement with previous assignments of the reference strains to distinct population groups  <cit> . in agreement with an earlier report  <cit> , one of the previously sequenced h. pylori strains  was most closely related to strains isolated in west africa, and another  was most closely related to strains isolated in europe. a third h. pylori strain  analyzed in a prior study was closely related to strains isolated in europe. figure  <dig> illustrates that strain 98- <dig> is most closely related to strains of east asian origin, and therefore, strain 98- <dig> belongs to a population cluster different from those of strains for which genome sequences were previously reported. collectively, the genome sequences available for analysis represent three main geographic populations of h. pylori strains .

analysis of caga and vaca
caga and vaca are two important h. pylori virulence factors that are secreted by a type iv secretion pathway and a type v  secretion pathway, respectively  <cit> . diversity in caga and vaca genes has been investigated in detail in previous studies, and diversity in these genes provides a basis for typing h. pylori strains  <cit> . therefore, we analyzed the caga and vaca genes in each of the two newly sequenced strains.

when strain 98- <dig> was incubated with ags gastric epithelial cells as described previously  <cit> , caga underwent tyrosine phosphorylation , which indicates that this strain has a functional type iv secretion system for translocation of caga into host cells  <cit> . the caga protein encoded by strain 98- <dig> contains  <dig> epiya motifs , which have been designated epiya-a, epiya-b, and epiya-d  <cit> . the presence of an epiya-d motif is characteristic of h. pylori strains isolated in east asia  <cit> . broth culture supernatant from strain 98- <dig> caused vacuolation of hela cells, indicating the presence of an active vaca toxin. this strain contains a type s1c/m <dig> vaca allele, a feature that is characteristic of h. pylori strains isolated in east asia  <cit> . identification of east asian caga and vaca motifs in strain 98- <dig> is consistent with the results of the mlst analysis, which classified strain 98- <dig> as a member of the east asian population cluster of h. pylori strains.

similar to strain 98- <dig>  strain b <dig> has a functional type iv secretion system that can translocate caga into gastric epithelial cells, and caga subsequently undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation  <cit> . the caga protein encoded by strain b <dig> contains two epiya motifs, designated epiya-a and epiya-c  <cit> . strain b <dig> contains a type s1/m <dig> vaca allele, but a vaca mutation in this strain is predicted to prevent expression of a full-length vaca protein. the presence of the latter mutation was confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis of a vaca fragment amplified by pcr. immunoblot analysis using multiple anti-vaca antisera indicated that this strain did not produce a detectable vaca protein, and broth culture supernatant from this strain did not cause vacuolation of hela cells .

characterization of the h. pylori core genome
delineation of a h. pylori core genome  is of interest, because many such genes are likely to be required for colonization of the human stomach. based on the use of blast score ratio analysis as described in the methods, we identified  <dig> genes that were present in all  <dig> h. pylori genomes . in a previous study,  <dig> different h. pylori strains were analyzed by array methodology, and a core genome of  <dig> genes was reported to be present in all  <dig> strains  <cit> . among the  <dig> genes reported to comprise the h. pylori core genome based on array analysis,  <dig> were present in all  <dig> strains analyzed in the current study, as determined by sequence analysis. the list of core genes detected in all five strains by sequence analysis but not by array analysis includes > <dig> genes located within the cag pai. although the cag pai is present in all  <dig> strains analyzed in the current study, this region of dna is known to be absent from many h. pylori strains  <cit> . five other clusters of contiguous genes  were present in all  <dig> sequenced strains, but were absent from the list of core genes identified by array analysis  . the differences in designation of core genes in the current study compared to previous studies can be attributed to numerous factors, including differences in the number of strains analyzed and differences in methodology for gene detection.

an analysis of the  <dig> core genes indicated that, in almost all cases, there were differences in the amino acid sequences of the proteins encoded by individual strains. pairwise comparisons of proteins encoded by different strains indicated that the levels of relatedness ranged from 65% to 100% amino acid identity. a representative comparison of the core proteins encoded by two strains  is shown in figure  <dig>  only  <dig> genes were identified for which the amino acid sequences of encoded proteins were identical among all  <dig> strains. seven of these  <dig> genes encoded ribosomal proteins; others encoded a translation initiation factor , a lipoprotein , a flagellar basal body protein , and a protein of unknown function .

analysis of divergent genes in an east asian cancer-associated h. pylori strain
h. pylori strains isolated from unrelated humans exhibit allelic diversity , which provides a basis for classification of strains into population clusters via mlst analysis. several genes exhibit a substantially higher level of allelic diversity. for example, at least two genes  are known to be markedly divergent in east asian h. pylori strains compared to western h. pylori strains  <cit> . we hypothesized that additional genes might be highly divergent in the east asian strain 98- <dig> compared to the other  <dig> sequenced strains. to identify gene products encoded by the genome of 98- <dig> that are markedly divergent compared to products encoded by the other  <dig> genomes, we focused on analysis of the  <dig> core genes that were present in all  <dig> sequenced strains. by using the approach described in methods, we identified  <dig> gene products that were highly divergent in the east asian strain compared to the other four strains . these include caga and a sel <dig> homologue, which were previously reported to be markedly divergent in east asian strains compared to strains from other parts of the world  <cit> . the amino acid sequences of these divergent proteins encoded by the japanese strain 98- <dig> were each <90% identical to sequences of corresponding proteins from the other four strains . in each case, the divergent alleles in strain 98- <dig> and corresponding alleles in the other four strains were flanked by the same chromosomal genes.

as shown in figure  <dig>  strain j <dig> was most closely related to h. pylori strains isolated in west africa, a population cluster different from those of the other strains for which genome sequences were available. therefore, we hypothesized that specific genes might be highly divergent in the west african strain j <dig> compared to the other  <dig> sequenced strains. to identify such genes, we used the same approach as described above. four unique highly divergent alleles were identified in strain j <dig> , each encoding products that were <90% identical to corresponding proteins in the other four strains. unique highly divergent alleles were not readily identifiable in strains  <dig>  hpag <dig>  or b <dig>  a notable exception was the identification of a highly divergent vaca allele in strain b <dig> . identification of vaca as a divergent allele in strain b <dig> is attributable to the presence of an s1/m <dig> vaca allele in this strain and the presence of s1/m <dig> alleles in the four other strains; m <dig> and m <dig> forms of vaca typically exhibit only 60â€“70% amino acid identity within the mid-region of the protein  <cit> .

identification of novel strain-specific genes
to identify strain-specific genes uniquely present in one of the two newly sequenced genomes but not previously sequenced h. pylori genomes, we again used a blast score ratio analysis, as described in the methods . strain 98- <dig> contained  <dig> novel strain-specific genes and strain b <dig> contained  <dig> . in addition, we identified  <dig> genes that were present in both strain 98- <dig> and b <dig>  but not present in any of the previously sequenced strains . several of the strain-specific orfs in h. pylori strains 98- <dig> and b <dig> were < <dig> nucleotides in length, and it is uncertain whether or not these very short orfs are actually translated into proteins. an analysis of unique strain specific genes in the three previously sequenced h. pylori genomes  revealed a similar number of unique strain-specific genes , which have been described in previous studies  <cit> .

to identify potential functions of the strain-specific genes found solely in strain 98- <dig> or b <dig> , the deduced protein sequences were used as queries for blast searching of an ncbi database of non-redundant protein sequences . most of the strain-specific proteins found solely in strain 98- <dig> or b <dig> were not closely related to any known proteins or were related to proteins in the database for which the functions are not known. several of the strain-specific genes found exclusively in strain 98- <dig> or b <dig> have been previously detected in strains of h. pylori for which the genome sequences have not been determined. as described above, insertion sequences and transposase-encoding genes  were identified. two strain-specific genes in h. pylori strain b <dig>  encoded proteins related to type iv secretion system components . the genes in this cluster  were not detected in the original genomic analyses of strains j <dig>   <dig>  or hpag <dig>  <cit> , but were subsequently detected in strain j <dig> and several other h. pylori strains  <cit> .

apresent in the indicated strain, but not in any of the other four strains for which genome sequences are available.

bthis group of genes was not detected in the original analysis of the genome from strain j <dig>  but was subsequently detected in strain j <dig>  <cit> .

cfor this analysis, an island was considered to be present if two or more strain-specific genes were in contiguous chromosomal loci.

interestingly, strain b <dig> contains several genes  predicted to encode proteins that are more closely related to proteins encoded by h. acinonychis   <cit>  or h. cetorum   <cit>  than to any previously reported h. pylori protein sequences . similarly, strain 98- <dig> contains a gene  predicted to encode a protein more closely related to a protein encoded by h. cetorum than to any previously reported h. pylori protein sequences .

subsets of the strain-specific genes found exclusively in strain 98- <dig> or b <dig> were found in contiguous chromosomal loci . two such gene clusters were identified in strain 98- <dig> and  <dig> were identified in strain b <dig>  these gene clusters ranged from two to nine genes in length. most of the gene clusters encode proteins of unknown function, but as noted above, one cluster encoded transposases and one cluster encoded two genes with homology to type iv secretion system components. the % g+c contents of three gene clusters in strain b <dig>  were each <30%, a value substantially lower than the total % g+c content of strain b <dig>  and lower than the % g+c content of previously analyzed h. pylori strains   <cit> . the low % g+c content of these gene clusters suggests that these segments of dna may have been acquired via horizontal transfer events.

strain-specific genes present in strains associated with gastric cancer or premalignant gastric lesions
atrophic gastritis is a premalignant lesion  <cit> , and h. pylori-infected patients with gastric ulcer disease have an increased risk of gastric cancer compared to h. pylori-infected patients with duodenal ulcer disease  <cit> . strain 98- <dig> was isolated from a patient with gastric cancer, and strains hpag <dig> and b <dig> were isolated from patients with atrophic gastritis and gastric ulcer disease, respectively. therefore, we sought to identify strain-specific genes present in these three strains, but absent from the other two strains for which genome sequences were available . ten strain-specific genes were found in the former  <dig> strains but were absent from strains  <dig> and j <dig> . these included  <dig> genes encoding restriction-modification systems and a gene predicted to encode an outer membrane protein; a previous study reported marked strain-specific variation in the size and sequence of this outer membrane protein  <cit> . we also performed a similar analysis to identify strain-specific genes present in various pairs of strains associated with malignant or premalignant conditions, but absent from strains  <dig> and j <dig> . the most commonly identified genes in these groups encoded restriction-modification systems or hypothetical proteins . one of the genes in strains b <dig> and hpag <dig>  is a restriction endonuclease-replacing gene that was previously reported to be more prevalent among strains from asian gastric cancer patients than among strains from non-cancer patients  <cit> . three strain-specific genes found in strain b <dig> and strain hpag <dig>  were previously reported to be localized on a plasmid in strain hpag <dig>  <cit> . another gene found exclusively in strain b <dig> and hpag <dig>  is found at the 3' end of the cag pai in some h. pylori strains, and encodes a protein of unknown function   <cit> . strain-specific genes shared by  <dig> and j <dig> , but not present in the three strains from patients with gastric cancer or premalignant gastric lesions are listed in additional file  <dig> 

apresent in the indicated strains, but not in the other strains for which genome sequences are available.

discussion
in this study, we analyzed the genome sequences of an h. pylori strain isolated from a patient with gastric cancer and an h. pylori strain from a patient with gastric ulcer disease, and compared these with previously determined genome sequences of h. pylori strains associated with superficial gastritis, atrophic gastritis, and duodenal ulcer disease. we identified  <dig> genes that were present in all  <dig> of these h. pylori strains. this group of genes may be considered to represent the h. pylori core genome. some of the genes within the core genome are predicted to be essential for h. pylori viability in vitro. one previous study identified  <dig> genes that were essential for h. pylori viability  <cit> ; all of these essential genes were present in the list of  <dig> core genes identified in the current study. other genes in the h. pylori core genome are not required for bacterial viability in vitro, but are predicted to be essential for h. pylori colonization of the stomach. among  <dig> genes essential for h. pylori colonization of a gerbil model  <cit> ,  <dig> were included in the core genome described in the current study. similarly, among  <dig> genes essential for h. pylori colonization of a mouse model   <cit> ,  <dig> were included in the core genome described in the current study.

several previous studies used array-based methodology to identify genes that are consistently present in all h. pylori strains analyzed  <cit> . the core genomes described in these previous studies have ranged from  <dig> genes to  <dig> genes. potential reasons for differences in the reported size of the h. pylori core genome include variations in the number and choice of h. pylori strains selected for analysis, as well as variation in the dna sequences that were used for array synthesis. in comparison to array-based methods, genome sequence analysis offers several potential advantages for delineation of a core genome. for example, genome sequence analysis is likely to be superior to array-based assays when differentiating between closely related paralogues, and genome sequence analysis is more likely to be successful in detecting the existence of highly divergent alleles. the main limitation of the sequence-based approach used in the current study for delineation of a core genome is that a relatively small number of genomes was analyzed. nevertheless, there was reasonably close agreement between the core genes identified in the current study and the core genes identified in a previous array study  <cit> .

analysis of the  <dig> core genes identified in this study revealed that the nucleotide sequences of these genes in individual strains were typically non-identical, and were differentiated by the presence of both synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions. as expected, allelic variation was detected within several housekeeping genes that have previously been used for mlst analysis. mlst analysis indicated that one of the strains analyzed in this study  belonged to an east asian population cluster of h. pylori strains, whereas the other strains for which genome sequences were available belonged to european or west african population clusters. thus, strain 98- <dig> is the first h. pylori strain from an east asian population cluster to be analyzed by genome sequence analysis. we then focused on the identification of core genes in strain 98- <dig> that encoded proteins that were highly divergent compared to proteins encoded by the other  <dig> strains for which genome sequences were available. eight such genes were identified . two of the genes shown in table  <dig>  have previously been reported to be highly divergent in east asian strains compared to western strains  <cit> . we speculate that several of the other genes listed in table  <dig> may exhibit similar patterns of geographic divergence. potentially the observed high level of divergence is associated with alterations in the functional activities of these proteins. the approach used in the current study prioritized identification of alleles that were highly divergent in one strain but similar in length compared to alleles in four other strains. a larger number of highly divergent alleles would have been identified if genes with substantial variations in length were included.

we identified several strain-specific genes in strain 98- <dig> or strain b <dig> that had not been previously described. many of the new strain-specific genes identified in the current study were not closely related to any genes in the databases or were related to proteins for which the functions are not known. notably, several of the new strain-specific genes identified in this study were closely related to genes present in related helicobacter species, such as h. acinonychis  <cit>  and h. cetorum  <cit> .

three of the strains for which genome sequences were available were isolated from patients with gastric cancer  or premalignant gastric lesions . therefore, we sought to identify genes present in these strains that were absent from strains isolated from patients with non-malignant conditions. we identified numerous genes that fulfilled these criteria . potentially several of these may be useful biomarkers for strains capable of inducing malignant or premalignant gastric lesions. further studies involving larger numbers of strains will be needed in order to test this hypothesis.

finally, it is notable that one of the strains selected for analysis in the current study  was isolated from a gastric cancer patient in japan, a country with a very high incidence of gastric cancer  <cit> . the biological basis for geographic variation in the incidence of gastric cancer is not yet clearly understood. both environmental factors  and host genetic factors may be contributory  <cit> . in addition, h. pylori strains circulating in some parts of the world may have an increased carcinogenic potential compared to strains circulating in other parts of the world. in support of the latter hypothesis, most h. pylori strains isolated in japan express forms of caga that have multiple sites where tyrosine phosphorylation can occur and a unique tyrosine phosphorylation site , resulting in high levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated caga within gastric epithelial cells and potent activation of the shp- <dig> tyrosine phosphatase  <cit> . in future studies, it will be important to study further the geographic variations that exist among h. pylori genomes by analyzing a larger number of strains, and to determine whether the presence of particular allelic variations or strain-specific genes correlates with specific disease outcomes such as gastric cancer.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we analyzed the genome sequences of an h. pylori strain isolated from a patient with gastric cancer and a strain isolated from a patient with gastric ulcer disease. each strain contained novel genes not present in previously described h. pylori genomes. in addition, highly divergent alleles were identified. comparative analysis of h. pylori strains isolated from patients with different clinical conditions provides a foundation for understanding why h. pylori may be associated with a variety of different gastroduodenal diseases.
