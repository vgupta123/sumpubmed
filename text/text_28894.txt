BACKGROUND
the complex aetiology of postpartum uterine disease involves multifactorial host and pathogen factors. occurring at a time of tremendous physiological change as a result of calving, the transition cow is also shifting from a state of immune quiescence that characterises the reproductive tract during pregnancy  <cit>  to heightened immune activation in response to bacterial colonisation of the postpartum uterus. massive tissue remodelling occurs and the restoration of tissue and immunological homeostasis  <cit>  is necessary before fertilisation can occur and the uterus can support a new pregnancy. in parallel, the transition cow is mobilising tremendous tissue energy reserves to support the change from a non-lactating state to peak milk production.

we and others have demonstrated significant upregulation of several inflammatory mechanisms in the healthy bovine uterus and have suggested that these mechanisms are required for normal involution, tissue remodelling and return of the uterus to a pregnancy-receptive state  <cit> . lower proinflammatory gene expression in the early postpartum period may contribute to delayed bacterial clearance and endometritis  <cit> , although higher proinflammatory gene expression  in the first week postpartum has also been reported in cows that developed persistent endometritis  <cit> . however, the point at which inflammation shifts from physiological to pathological during the development of uterine disease remains to be understood  <cit> .

anaerobic and aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria are present in the uterus of more than 90 % of cows in the first two weeks postpartum  <cit> , although the complexity of the microbial population and the differentiation between commensal and potentially pathogenic strains is only emerging  <cit> . factors governing susceptibility to the development of disease are poorly understood although it is estimated that up to 50 % of dairy cows are affected by some form of vaginal, cervical or uterine disease after calving. the load and species composition of the causitive bacteria will likely play critical roles in driving and also regulating local inflammatory responses within the endometrium. the temporal kinetics and regulation of these changes will influence the efficacy of the immune response, the degree of resultant uterine pathology and the timeframe in which normal reproductive function can be restored.

manifestations of uterine disease span from clinical metritis or purulent vaginal discharge , occurring in the immediate postpartum period to sub-clinical or cytological endometritis  which is usually diagnosed from 21 days postpartum   <cit> . clinical manifestations of uterine disease are associated with prolonged uterine involution, reduced fertility and poorer production  <cit> . however, the effects of ce on subsequent fertility are not as apparent, which is due to the ability of some cows to resolve sub-clinical infection  <cit>  and also partly accounted for by the various definition of disease used, diagnostic method and time at which disease is assessed. however a meta-analysis of  <dig> studies found that endometritis increased by  <dig> the mean number of days a cow was not in calf, decreased the relative risk of pregnancy  by almost one-third and reduced the rate at which cows became pregnant by 16 %  <cit> .

given the high nutrient demands of the postpartum dairy cow, it is not surprising that recent studies have attributed the development of ce to a physiological dysfunction as a result of inadequate energy supply  <cit> . however other analysts attribute the rationale for the development of endometritis to high uterine bacterial load and compromised immune function  <cit> . while there is certainly a genetic component underlying disease susceptibility  <cit> , the interactions between the physiology of the cow, the host immune system and the bacterial challenge will all affect the outcome of uterine infection.

we propose that dysregulated inflammatory responses to local bacterial colonisation early postpartum facilitates the development of endometritis. following calving, efficient mobilisation of immune cells is required to clear bacterial infection from the uterus, and innate immunity facilitated by polymorphonuclear leukocytes  is regarded as the predominant mechanism of early defence in the involuting uterus  <cit> . we have previously demonstrated the induction of specific proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in cows with inflamed uteri  <cit> , and pan-genomic transcriptomic analysis of uterine biopsies showed a switch from a pro-inflammatory immune response to a tissue remodelling and repair phenotype in healthy beef breed cows  <cit> . in the present study, we focus on endometrial tissue from dairy cows, with and without ce. using next-generation sequencing, we have profiled the temporal changes in mrna gene and mirna expression at two time points in uterine biopsies with a view to defining differentially expressed inflammatory genes and pathways at  <dig> dpp which may predict cows at risk of developing uterine disease.

RESULTS
divergent mrna and mirna expression profiles at  <dig> dpp between hc cows and cows that subsequently develop ce
uterine biopsies were graded by the degree of immune cell infiltrate into the endometrium at  <dig> dpp . cows yielding low and high scores  were assigned to either the healthy control  or cytological endometritis  groups, respectively. transcriptomic datasets were then generated to assess the differential expression of both genes and mirna between  <dig> and  <dig> dpp. summary statistics for these  <dig> mrna and  <dig> mirna libraries are shown in additional file 1: table s <dig>  gene expression results are graphically represented in fig. 2a and tabulated in additional file 2: table s <dig>  results of bioinformatic analysis of the mrna and mirna transcriptomic data are shown in additional supplementary tables .fig.  <dig> histological analysis of biospies acccording to leukocyte infiltration into the epithelial and stromal layers of the uterus. a and c representative histological classification of endometrial biopsies at  <dig> dpp shows significant immune cell infiltrate. b this influx of leukocytes is not apparent in hc cows, which have resolved inflammation by  <dig> dpp. d cows that develop ce however, have sustained immune cell infiltrate in the endometrium at  <dig> dpp. magnification shown in 400×

top panel high numbers of genes are differentially expressed in the endometrium from the hc  group between  <dig> and  <dig> dpp, whereas  the same transition in gene expression profile between time points is not present in cows that develop ce. the numbers of significantly differentially expressed genes between groups at both postpartum time points are shown . within group comparisons are shown in red boxes, and between group comparisons are in blue boxes. the numbers in green ovals show the direction in relative gene expression between comparisons. b mds plots generated from endometrial rna-seq data shows clearer clustering of  <dig> and  <dig> dpp time points for the hc group  than for the ce group . nine hc  endometrial samples at both  <dig> dpp  and corresponding same animal sample at  <dig> dpp  and b six ce  cows at the same two time points are shown. corresponding gene lists are shown in additional file 2: table s2



only  <dig> genes were significantly differentially expressed between the ce and hc animals at  <dig> dpp, and the majority  are increased in expression in the cows that subsequently developed ce . a full list of deg is given in additional file 2: table s <dig> but of the top  <dig> most significantly deg, expression of seven genes are increased, and three are decreased in ce at  <dig> dpp  . several immune-related genes were differentially increased in ce, the most significant of which was masp <dig> , which encodes an enzyme involved in the lectin pathway of the complement system. the immunoglobulin superfamily member  <dig> gene , interferon gamma-inducible protein  <dig> gene  and mzb <dig> gene, encoding marginal zone b and b <dig> cell-specific protein are also significantly increased . in conjunction, increased expression of cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd79a and cd79b all point toward increased b-cell activation in the animals that subsequently develop ce. the latter two genes encode a dimer associated with membrane-bound immunoglobulin in b-cells, thus forming the b-cell antigen receptor . furthermore, the pou2af <dig> gene- a transcriptional coactivator essential for the response of b-cells to antigens was significantly increased. seven kegg pathways were identified as significantly enriched with differentially expressed genes from this dataset . the most significantly enriched pathway identified was neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction and the second was b-cell receptor signalling . of the  <dig> genes with increased expression in the hc animals , cytochrome p <dig>  family  <dig>  subfamily a, polypeptide  <dig>  was the most highly differentially expressed, with a log <dig> fc of  <dig>  . this gene encodes a monooxygenase, the physiological role of which is to regulate the cellular levels of retinoic acid  <cit> . increased expression of the nppc gene was also detected, and this gene encodes natriuretic peptide precursor c which has been shown to stimulate ovarian follicle development  <cit> .table  <dig> top  <dig> deg  between hc and ce samples at  <dig> dpp

the expression of  <dig> mirnas differentiated between ce and hc animals at  <dig> dpp, with no endometrial mirnas being differentially expressed at  <dig> dpp . of the differentially expressed mirna,  <dig> were increased in ce and five were increased in hc. this number is reduced to  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, when a log <dig> fc filter of > <dig>  is applied to exclude lowly differentially expressed mirna . consistent upregulation of the bta-mir- <dig> family members was detected in ce endometrial samples, including bta-mir-200b, bta-mir-200c and bta-mir- <dig> . in hc samples, upregulation of bta-mir- <dig>  bta-mir-450b and bta-mir- <dig> was detected.table  <dig> deg mirna 7dpp between groups 



prolonged cytokine signalling, β-defensin and s <dig> antimicrobial peptide expression in ce cows at  <dig> dpp
at  <dig> dpp,  <dig> genes were significantly differentially expressed between hc and cows diagnosed with ce . the expression of the majority of these genes  was increased in expression in the ce animals , similar to the  <dig> dpp results. the most highly differentially expressed gene in cows with ce was keratin  <dig> , which together with the significantly increased krt <dig> and krt <dig> encode keratin proteins involved in the maintenance of the structural integrity of epithelial tissues. the different classes of de immune genes are shown in additional file 6: table s <dig>  these include increased expression of genes encoding cell surface receptors ; chemokine ligands and receptors ; cytokines and receptors ; antimicrobial peptides  in ce samples at  <dig> dpp .

increased expression in hc animals is detected for  <dig> genes at  <dig> dpp relative to ce . the most highly differentially expressed gene was tdgf <dig>  a gene which encodes an epidermal growth factor-related protein . hif3a was also increased, which encodes the alpha- <dig> subunit of one of several heterodimeric transcription factors that regulate many adaptive responses to hypoxia .

forty-five significantly enriched kegg pathways were identified in this gene dataset of which cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction was the most significant. multiple other immune-related pathways were also significantly enriched including b cell receptor, toll-like receptor, jak-stat, nod-like receptor and chemokine signaling pathways . the top go enriched biological process was the defence response, followed by immune and then inflammatory response .fig.  <dig> top  <dig> significantly enriched biological processes in the endometrium identified by gene ontological analysis. using significantly differentially expressed gene datasets, gene ontology analysis identifed the enriched biological processes  in hc cows between  <dig> and  <dig> dpp and b between hc and ce samples at  <dig> dpp. the resolution of the inflammatory response in hc cows  is evident as these defence and innate immune response processes are switched off. the sustained inflammatory response  is evident in  as these processes are enriched in ce compared to hc at  <dig> dpp. for full list of enriched gene ontologies, see additional file 4: table s4



normal transition from an inflammatory phenotype at  <dig> dpp to tissue proliferation and repair at  <dig> dpp does not occur in endometrium of cows with ce
four thousand one hundred ninety-seven genes were significantly differentially expressed between  <dig> and  <dig> dpp samples in hc cows, of which only  <dig> had a log <dig> fc greater than ± <dig>  over  <dig> fold more genes were significantly differentially expressed between  <dig> and  <dig> dpp in the hc than was the case for ce animals . of the  <dig> genes,  <dig> displayed higher expression at  <dig> dpp, whereas  <dig> were elevated in expression at  <dig> dpp . on the basis of these transcriptomic differences, multidimensional scaling  plots show the presence of a distinct temporal response profile at  <dig> and  <dig> dpp in hc cows. although some structure is also apparent in the mds plot from ce animals, the separation is not as clear, which is reflected in the significantly lower numbers of genes differentially expressed between these two timepoints . furthermore, the wide disparity between the  <dig> dpp ce samples suggests high inter-animal variation in the transcriptional response at this early post-partum time point.

the classes of immune genes de in hc cows between  <dig> and  <dig> dpp are shown in table  <dig>  these include complement proteins involved in antibacterial immunity. cell surface receptors including cd <dig>  cd1e and cd <dig>  which are preferentially expressed on monocytes/macrophages were increased. expression of cd <dig> which encodes a transmembrane receptor  expressed on the surface of dendritic cells and macrophages, and was also increased at  <dig> dpp. genes encoding several receptor signalling and proinflammatory proteins, including the expression of toll-like receptors , accessory signalling proteins , and other signalling intermediates were also upregulated. kegg pathway analysis identified an enrichment of genes from the tlr signalling pathway . the most highly differentially expressed gene at  <dig> dpp was il <dig> . however il1a, il1r <dig> and il1r <dig> as well as tnf were also increased in expression. of particular relevance in the defence against pathogenic bacteria, expression of the antimicrobial peptides, β-defensin expression was significantly elevated at  <dig> dpp, including defb, defb <dig> and defb <dig>  the expression of the related s <dig> family of amps was also elevated at  <dig> dpp, including s100a <dig>  s100a <dig>  s100a <dig>  s100a <dig> and s100a <dig>  genes encoding the acute phase proteins hp, lipopolysaccharide binding protein , saa <dig> and saa <dig>  including the mammary associated form  and transferrin  were also increased , showing endometrial expression of these liver-associated molecules.table  <dig> significantly deg  in hc samples between  <dig> and  <dig> dpp

fig.  <dig> the kyoto encyclopaedia of genes and genomes  annotated the toll-like receptor signalling pathway as significantly enriched in the rna-seq dataset for hc. green boxes highlight the genes within the pathway that are significantly elevated in expression  <dig> dpp. for other significantly enriched pathways see figure s <dig>  and figure s <dig> . for full list of differentially expressed pathways see also additional file 3: table s3



between  <dig> and  <dig> dpp in hc, kegg pathway analysis identified significant enrichment of  <dig> pathways with predominant enrichment of immune-related pathways. the top differentially expressed pathway was lysosome, which is the cellular organelle involved in the digestion and removal of bacteria . complement and coagulation cascades was the second most significantly enriched pathway. cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and chemokine signaling, toll-like receptor signaling, b cell receptor signaling, nod-like receptor signaling, natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity and mapk signaling pathways were all identified as significantly enriched . gene ontology analysis also identified an enrichment of genes involved with the biological process of the inflammatory and innate immune response . in contrast, calcium signalling was identified as one of the predominant kegg pathways activated at  <dig> dpp  and the regulation of calcium was identified as a significantly enriched biological process based on gene ontology analysis . the restoration of homestasis in the healthy postpartum endometrium is marked by a reduction in inflammatory gene expression at  <dig> dpp. in hc cows, the most highly differentially expressed gene at  <dig> dpp was the transcription factor hif3a, which regulates the response to low oxygen , which is in contrast to the low fold changes in the majority of significantly elevated genes at this time point. the previous upregulation of inflammatory genes detected at  <dig> dpp has been replaced with increased expression of a smaller number of chemokines at  <dig> dpp including ccl <dig>  upregulation of cd79a and cd79b was also apparent, and insulin-like growth factor  expression is increased. despite the reduced expression of other inflammatory genes, the il17d gene and il <dig> receptor genes il17rb and il17rd are significantly increased at  <dig> dpp .

in contrast to the marked transition that occurred between  <dig> dpp and  <dig> dpp in hc cows, only  <dig> genes were significantly differentially expressed in the endometrial biopsies from ce cows between the same time points . heat maps, generated on the basis of these deg clearly shows two distinct gene sets, which differentiate the  <dig> and  <dig> dpp groups. whereas clear changes in gene expression profile can be seen between samples in the hc group , the signal is less clear in the ce group . higher interanimal variation in ce group is also evident in contrast to the clear temporal switch apparent in hc group.fig.  <dig> heat map representation depicting the temporal changes in significantly differentially expressed genes from uterine biopsies between  <dig> and  <dig> dpp in the a hc and b ce cows. all  <dig> significantly degs were used to generate the heatmap in the ce group, and a similar number of the top degs  were used for comparative purposes for the hc group. scale: yellow indicates high expression and red is low expression. unsupervised hierarchical clustering dendograms are included for these genes. a – de genes between day  <dig> and  <dig> dpp in hc animals and b – de genes between day  <dig> and  <dig> dpp in ce cows



validation of inflammatory phenotype in cows with ce
a panel of  <dig>  predominantly immune-related genes were chosen for validation of the ngs data by qrt-pcr in both hc and ce samples at  <dig> and  <dig> dpp. results showed high concordance in the detection of gene expression changes between ngs and qrt-pcr technologies. significantly enhanced il1b , il <dig>  and il17a  gene expression was evident at  <dig> dpp in cows that subsequently developed ce . the presence of a prolonged inflammatory profile in cows that develop ce was supported by significantly higher il1a , il1b , il <dig> , il17a  in uterine biopsies from ce cows at  <dig> dpp relative to hc cow samples . interestingly, higher expression of il1r <dig>  and the gene excoding the anti-inflamammatory cytokine il <dig>  was also detected in ce samples at  <dig> dpp. although not all genes reached statistical significance, the reduction in the gene expression levels between  <dig> and  <dig> dpp is more pronounced for the hc samples , than the ce cows  supporting the finding of prolonged inflammation at  <dig> dpp. significant reductions in the expression of il1r <dig>  and il <dig>  are detected for hc cows, but are absent for ce cows at  <dig> dpp .fig.  <dig> rt-qpcr validation of gene expression changes detected using mrna-seq. confirmation of differentially expressed genes from ngs results using quantitative real-time pcr. significant changes in gene expression of both a pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines as well as other b effector molecules of the immune response confirmed the findings from ngs. results are colour-coded according to comparison and levels of expression of each gene of interest was normalised to expression levels of ppia; d7pp between sce and hc cows , d21pp between sce and hc , between d <dig> and d21pp in sce  and between d <dig> and d21pp in hc . between and within group comparisons are separated by a dotted line. *p <  <dig> ; **p <  <dig> . n = 5– <dig> samples per time point, bars represent mean ± sem



a subset of additional genes differentially expressed using the ngs approach were also validated by qrt-pcr. the significantly different expression of s100a <dig>  igfbp <dig>  sepinb <dig>  dgat <dig> and saa1/ <dig> support the ngs data . furthermore, validation included genes that were increased in expression in the hc at  <dig> dpp, including hif3a . qrt-pcr expression profile for the csf <dig> gene did not correlate with the findings from the ngs data, possibly due to the large inter-animal variation in read-counts detected for this gene .

temporal changes in mirna expression are similar between groups
thirty-six mirna are differentially expressed between  <dig> dpp and  <dig> dpp in the hc cows, with  <dig> in the ce cows . two mirna are increased in expression at  <dig> dpp and  <dig> are increased at  <dig> dpp with a log <dig> fc filter of > <dig>  in hc . expression of related mirna family members was apparent with increased expression of bta-mir-34b  and bta-mir-34c , as well as bta-mir-449a, bta-mir-449b and bta-mir-449c . similarly  <dig> are increased at  <dig> dpp and  <dig> increased at  <dig> dpp with a log <dig> fc filter of > <dig>  in ce . related mirnas bta-mir-200a, bta-mir-200b and bta-mir-200c are all increased in expression at  <dig> dpp . also bta-mir- <dig> is the most highly differentially expressed with a log <dig> fc of  <dig> . the mds plot which classifies the animals on the basis of their mirna expression profile shows a clear separation between  <dig> dpp and  <dig> dpp hc animals  as well as for the ce animals . this structure reflects the numbers of mirna found to be differentially expressed between timepoints . interestingly, less clustering is apparent within the  <dig> dpp ce samples, as was reflected in the mrna mds plot .fig.  <dig> multi-dimensional scaling  plots generated from endometrial microrna-seq data. a mds-plot shown for hc cows at both  <dig>  and  <dig> dpp . similarly, b mds-plot shown for ce cows at both  <dig>  and  <dig> dpp . clustering of the d <dig> and d <dig> profiles is apparent at both time points for hc and ce cows although tighter clustering of  <dig> dpp samples for the hc group than for the ce group  shows a higher degree of variation between samples at  <dig> dpp . five hc  samples at both  <dig> dpp  and corresponding same animal sample at  <dig> dpp  and b) five ce  cows at the same two time points are shown



distinct endometrial bacterial populations present in ce and hc cows
with the aim of determining whether the observed differences in the uterine transcriptomes of ce and hc groups are accompanied by changes of microbial composition, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism  was employed to assess the composition of the microbial communities in the uterus of hc and ce cows at  <dig> and  <dig> dpp. in total,  <dig> operational taxonomic units  were observed with a median of  <dig>  otus per sample. while the median number of otus in the ce group was unchanged , an increase was observed in the hc group, from  <dig> otus to  <dig>  otus at  <dig> dpp and  <dig> dpp, respectively. to correct for the impact of low incidence otus, otus represented in only one or two samples were removed. this resulted in a data set of  <dig> otus still showing an increased number in the hc group . the anova test revealed significant differences in the number of otus  and tukey’s test attributed these differences to the hc groups at  <dig> and  <dig> dpp . these results are consistent with an increased bacterial diversity in the hc group during the time frame of the study. the bray-curtis similarity was used to compare the microbial communities associated with the samples. principal coordinates ordination  allowed the visualisation of the distribution of the variation within the data set . pco <dig> and pco <dig> accounted for  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the variation of the data, in which the first principal coordinate segregated most hc from ce samples. permanova analysis showed a significant difference in the composition of the microbial communities present between hc and ce cows .fig.  <dig> principal coordinates ordination of endometrial bacterial communities. bacterial community analysis, performed using culture-independent terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism , shows a significant clustering of samples according to their respective microbial communities. hc and ce cows are shown as blue and red circles, respectively



systemic early cellular and immune changes differentiate between hc and ce cows but metabolite expression levels do not
the numbers of circulating neutrophils in blood decreased significantly from pre-calving values to  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells/μl at  <dig> dpp in blood from cows that developed ce samples  . in contrast the hc animals showed a significant increase in numbers to  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells/μl cells at the same time point . the systemic eosinophil counts show even more pronounced changes with a significant reduction in both groups at  <dig> dpp. in cows with ce, eosinophil numbers dropped to 1 ×  <dig> cells/μl at  <dig> dpp  and to 3 ×  <dig> cells/μl in hc . by  <dig> dpp, eosinophil numbers had been restored to pre-calving levels in both groups .fig.  <dig> analysis of systemic immune and metabolite parameters in hc and ce cows. significant early reductions in circulating granulocyte numbers in cows that subsequently developed ce. absolute cell counts in peripheral blood leukocytes  for a neutrophils and b eosinophils. elevated plasma expression levels for c haptoglobin , d serum amyloid a  but not e interleukin  <dig>  were also detected in cows with ce. no significant differences in serum metabolite profile for f β-hydroxybutyrate , g non-esterified fatty acids  and h urea between cows that developed ce and hc, although temporal changes were significantly changed. samples labelled as pc , and at  <dig> and  <dig> dpp in hc and ce cows.*p <  <dig> ; **p <  <dig> . n = 5– <dig> samples per timepoint and bars represent mean ± sem



in contrast to circulating cell numbers, the concentrations of apps in serum from ce cows increased significantly at  <dig> dpp. hp levels increased significantly in both groups from pre-calving levels to  <dig>  mg/ml  and  <dig>  mg/ml  in ce and hc cows at  <dig> dpp respectively . expression levels were also significantly different between the hc and ce cows at  <dig> dpp . levels of saa increased from  <dig>  μg/ml to  <dig>  μg/ml in the ce group at  <dig> dpp . the elevated saa expression was over two fold higher than expression levels in hc animals at the same time point  .

the systemic expression of proinflammatory chemokines  and cytokines  was examined in sera using samples collected at both pre- and post-calving at  <dig> and  <dig> dpp. a low concentration of il <dig> was expressed and il <dig> was not detected in all animals. average il- <dig> expression expression levels were 17 pg/ml at pre-calving and  <dig> and  <dig> dpp levels  were not significantly different. il- <dig> and il- <dig> cytokines were detected intermittently in serum from some animals, however only il- <dig> could be statistically analysed. the only significant difference detected in il- <dig> expression levels was a reduction from pre-calving levels in ce animals to  <dig>  ng/ml at  <dig> dpp  .

selected metabolites were also analysed in serum from the same animals, and as expected significant elevation of bhb, nefa and urea was detected across the calving window . all three metabolites were significantly increased in both groups at both  <dig> and  <dig> dpp relative to levels at calving, but no significant difference between groups was detected. there was no significant change in glucose levels between groups, at any time point .

discussion
productive and reproductive efficiency in high yielding dairy cattle requires a disease-free transition period  <cit>  and uterine pathology is a major contributory factor to poorer fertility outcomes  <cit> . multiple studies have shown the early activation of an immune response in the postpartum uterus  <cit>  and mechanisms have been proposed to show how bacteria can drive reproductive dysfunction  <cit> . using next-generation sequencing of the endometrial transcriptome, our previous work identified the immune transition which occurs in healthy beef-breed cows, during which normal function is restored in the the postpartum period  <cit> . the current study develops this analysis both in dairy cows, and in cows that were diagnosed with ce. the numbers of differentially expressed genes were over  <dig> fold higher in the endometrium from healthy cows than in cows with ce, and innate immune genes and signalling pathways were activated in both groups of cows at  <dig> dpp. pathway analysis and go enrichment indicated an abundance of molecules contributing to a proinflammatory environment, including the expression of toll-like receptors , which are key to the early activation of an innate immune response in the endometrium as they detect pathogen associated molecular patterns  on bacteria  <cit> . in conjunction with nod/card intracytoplasmic proteins, tlrs mediate signals to key transcription factors including nf-κb to activate pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines  which regulate the innate and adaptive immune response for the efficient clearance of infection.

il- <dig> is a key mediator of the host’s inflammatory immune response to infections, and its secretion is elevated during endometrial necrosis  <cit> . in this study, il <dig> expression is enhanced at  <dig> dpp in cows that subsequently develop ce, and this heightened expression  is maintained in ce cows at  <dig> dpp. a high concentration of il- <dig> is thought to influence the systemic inflammatory response to induce app synthesis in the liver, stimulation of il- <dig> and the production of neutrophils in the bone marrow  <cit> . interestingly, il <dig> is the most highly induced gene in hc at  <dig> dpp this study. qrt-pcr analysis also confirmed a role for an additional inflammatory cytokine—interleukin  <dig>  at both post-partum time points. il17a gene expression was significantly increased by  <dig> fold in ce cows relative to hc cows at  <dig> dpp. il17a drives the recruitment of inflammatory cells  as well as the proliferation of stromal cells which contributes to the pathogenesis of uterine disease in humans  <cit> . significantly elevated il17a is also evident in ce samples at  <dig> dpp. higher inflammatory gene expression in the first week post-partum is associated with poorer reproductive outcomes across multiple species  <cit> , and it is likely that the excessive inflammation driven by these potent cytokines is associated with the development of ce in cattle. in fact, the significantly increased il <dig> at  <dig> dpp in the ce samples may reflect an attempt to limit endometrial tissue damage due to excessive inflammation.

despite the common inflammatory phenotype in hc and ce cows at  <dig> dpp, two key findings differentiate hc cows from cows that subsequently develop ce. firstly, transcriptomic profiling identified  <dig> genes and  <dig> mirnas that reliably differentiate the groups at  <dig> dpp, and as such may hold prognostic potential. expression profiling has reliably shown that excessive activation of inflammatory cytokines in the early post-partum period may be associated with the subsequent development of uterine disease. however, the early inflammatory environment is not only characterised by the expression of inflammatory cytokines. expression of cell surface markers  and b cell antigen receptor complex  in ce cows are all associated with the activation of b lymphocytes and immunoglobulin synthesis  <cit> . the transcription factor pou2af <dig> is essential for the response of b-cells to antigens  <cit>  and is highly differentially expressed between hc and ce cows. based on the suite of differentially expressed genes, kegg pathway analysis identified the enrichment of b-cell related processes in ce samples. of relevance is the emerging literature on the role of innate-like b cells in inflammatory diseases  <cit> , which may prove a productive research avenue in relation to endometritis in cattle, but on which little is currently known. investigation of these markers in a larger panel of post-partum cows is now warranted.

secondly, the development of ce is characterised by a lack of resolution of inflammation between  <dig> and  <dig> dpp. ngs data shows that the transcriptomic switch that occurs in hc cows over the course of involution from an inflammatory to a restorative phenotype does not occur in cows that develop ce. qrt-pcr validation shows significantly increased inflammatory gene expression as well as the increased expression of genes encoding anti-inflammatory proteins, including il- <dig>  in cows with ce. by  <dig> dpp, the uterine environment in healthy cows has significantly reduced almost all inflammatory markers, and these signalling pathways have been replaced by genes involved in calcium regulation. the elevation of the genes encoding serca pumps, members of the solute carrier family and ryanodine receptor , calmodulin  and ca2þ/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii  that are increased highlighting an increased ability to regulate calcium levels and signalling in the uterus  <cit> . calcium influx through the plasma membrane is also permitted by voltage-gated/operated/dependent calcium channels which are complexes containing several subunits , the genes for which are also elevated at  <dig> dpp. genes encoding important components that link this change in calcium concentration and prostaglandin f2α  synthesis,  are significantly elevated in hc  <dig> dpp in this study. as pgf is a vital component of the estrus cycle  <cit> , a greater capacity to resolve endometrial inflammation by  <dig> dpp may enhance a cow’s ability to elevate the production and secretion of pgf, permitting uterine tissue remodelling and normal cyclic progression compared to a cow experiencing sustained endometrial inflammation  <dig> dpp. the small numbers of differentially expressed genes between  <dig> and  <dig> dpp in the ce cows show that this transition did not occur and that inflammatory cell signalling was maintained.

mirna profiling may shed light on the regulation of the postpartum immune response and importantly, our results suggests that specific mirnas may hold prognostic potential for endometritis. in the current study, all  <dig> members of the mir- <dig> family, mir-200a, mir-200b, mir-200c, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  are significantly elevated  <dig> dpp in ce cows relative to  <dig> dpp. the high differential expression of  <dig> mirnas, including some of these members—specifically mir-200b and mir-200c are also higher in ce than hc cows at  <dig> dpp. relevantly, studies in the human endometrium have revealed that mirna expression regulates cellular proliferation, migration and the mir- <dig> family members assist in these processes  <cit> . the let- <dig> family of mirna has been implicated in the regulation of the inflammatory reponse, through mediation of il- <dig> and il- <dig> cytokines  <cit>  and bta-let-7c is significantly elevated in ce cows at  <dig> dpp in this study. further investigation is required to determine the consequences of the significant increased regulation of this and additional mirnas in ce cows at  <dig> dpp on the development of a restorative immune response within the uterus and their potential utilty as diagnostics of disease.

following a normal parturition, consistent bacterial clearance and recontamination can occur within the first two weeks postpartum and in the absence of clinical illness, spontaneously clears by  <dig> to  <dig> dpp  <cit> . multiple bacterial species have been associated with the development of disease in the postpartum period including trueperella pyogenes and escherichia coli  <cit> . emerging culture-independent techniques are providing unparalled resolution into the diversity of bacterial species present in the postpartum uterus and those potentially contributing to disease  <cit> . culture-independent analysis used in the current study shows significantly different microbial populations in the uterus of ce cows, which concurs with the differential expression of diverse tlrs. it is likely therefore that the divergent immune and restorative signalling pathways in the endometrium result, at least in part, from the composition of the microbial populations present.

the differential expression of antimicrobial peptides  between hc and ce cows is of particular relevance to this study, especially given the shift in bacterial populations detected between groups. β-defensins are critical effector molecules of the immune response, which have been shown to be expressed in response to lps in uterine epithelial cells  <cit> . interestingly, genes encoding β-defensin amps  are significantly and elevated in expression in ce animals at  <dig> dpp , suggesting an inability to control infection. furthermore, the s <dig> family of amps are lps responsive  <cit>  calcium-binding proteins  <cit>  which have a wide variety of actions in innate immunity including the blocking of neutrophil migration  <cit>  are also increased in ce samples at  <dig> dpp. s100a <dig> has previously been reported as significantly increased in the endometrium from cows with endometritis  <cit> . the significant reduction in the expression of a number of β-defensin and s <dig> amp genes by  <dig> dpp in hc cows only, suggests that ce cows have on-going infection.

an intricate relationship exists between metabolism and immunity  <cit>  and central to both is the hepatic function  <cit> . as the main centre for mobilization of nutrients including non-esterified fatty acids  in addition to homeostatic and immune functions, which includes the synthesis of acute phase proteins, the liver is often used as a sentinel of physiological pressure, especially in the high-yielding dairy cow  <cit> . during severe negative energy balance, systemic concentrations of nefas and β-hydroxybutyrate  are elevated, indicating lipid mobilization and fatty acid oxidation  <cit>  and circulating levels of glucose decrease  <cit> . in the current study hc and ce cows had peripheral concentrations of nefas and bhb below and glucose levels above those observed in severe neb  <cit>  and additionally, no significant differences in any of the blood metabolites analysed within and between groups  <dig> and  <dig> dpp was detected. therefore we conclude that it is unlikely that neb is contributing to the divergent immune response profiles detected between ce and hc cows in this study.

although the link between inflammation, liver function and fertility are poorly understood  <cit> , acute phase proteins are often used as an indicator of liver malfunctions across a range of species. it was of interest to note that many of the differentially expressed genes are classically thought to be of hepatic origin  are also expressed in endometrial tissue. the divergence in apps, particularly in hp expression levels between cows with uterine infection and cows that are healthy postpartum has been previously reported  <cit> . at  <dig> dpp, elevated hp has been associated with poorer fertility and avoiding the acute phase response during the transition period has been suggested as a possible route toward improving reproductive performance in high-yielding dairy cows  <cit> . while saa levels are very dynamic during the peri-partum period, elevated expression levels of both hp and saa have been proposed as potential diagnostics—particularly for clinical disease   <cit> . the concentrations of app have been shown to reflect the magnitude of lps exposure  <cit> , suggesting that the concentration of uterine microbes will be reflected in app expression levels. while there is no doubt that they are sensitive indicators of infection, the increased plasma expression detected at  <dig> dpp in ce cows in this study are unlikely to be specific for uterine infection as elevated hp and saa have been shown in sera from mastitic cows experimentally infected with s. aureus  <cit> . however, the magnitude of the increased hp and saa detected in this study is significantly higher than the levels found in cows with natural mastitis infection   <cit> .

other systemic immune changes detected in cows with ce was an early significant reduction in the numbers of circulating granulocytes—both neutrophils and eosinophils. it is presumed that this reduction in granulocyte number systemically reflects homing of these cells to the inflamed uterus as was detected histologically. neutrophils and eosinophils use the molecules  stored in their granules to kill microorganisms and they also produce reactive oxygen species  required for the formation of dna-containing extra-cellular traps, which bind and kill bacteria. however eosinophils can modulate innate and adaptive immunity by producing immunoregulatory cytokines and are also involved in tissue repair and remodelling  <cit> .

there is no doubt that inflammation is classically described as pathological, being the cause of significant morbidity and mortality. multiple studies, and our earlier work has documented significantly elevated proinflammatory immune gene expression in the postpartum uterus  <cit> . however, the presence of inflammation is not necessarily detrimental; indeed a pro-inflammatory immune response has been shown to be beneficial to a successful pregnancy  <cit> . in humans, it has long been recognised that it is poor regulation of inflammation that contributes to poorer reproductive outcomes  <cit> . in earlier work, the activation of inflammation and subsequent restoration of physiological function in the uterus of healthy cows by  <dig> dpp led us to conclude that postpartum inflammation is a normal physiological event  <cit> . significantly, we then identified a temporal switch that healthy animals undergo from a proinflammatory gene expression profile to a regenerative and proliferation profile  <cit> . the current study supports this trend and shows that in animals which develop ce, this transition is arrested or delayed leading to sub-optimal restoration of homeostasis which is likely to have negative reproductive outcomes. in that regard, manipulating the expression of antimicrobial peptides  and immunoregulatory molecules  may hold the key to regulating inflammation and the restoration of homeostasis in the bovine uterus, thereby improving disease outcomes.

although there is no doubt that the development of endometritis results from complex interplay between microbes and host factors, analysis of the uterine transcriptional landscape, at both mirna and mrna levels, has provided a powerful insight into the regulation of immunity during the critical peri-parturient period. while reliable information on the role and gene targets of mirnas is currently limited, particularly in cattle, the analysis of specific mirnas identified as differentially expressed in this study can now be targeted in follow on functional studies. this combined dataset complements profiling at a systemic level, suggesting that even in cows with sce, early changes in peripheral blood can be detected. while this study is limited by the numbers of infected cattle analysed at only two post-partum time-points, a number of novel hypotheses have been generated that can now be tested in larger numbers of post-partum cattle with endometritis.

CONCLUSIONS
although it is recognised that the development of endometritis results from complex interplay between microbes and host factors, analysis of the uterine transcriptional landscape, at both mirna and mrna levels, has provided a powerful insight into the regulation of immunity during the critical peri-parturient period. while reliable information on the role and gene targets of mirnas is currently limited, particularly in cattle, the analysis of specific mirnas identified as differentially expressed in this study can now be targeted in follow on functional studies. this combined dataset complements profiling at a systemic level, suggesting that even in cows with sce, early changes in peripheral blood can differentiate them from healthy cows. while this study is limited by the numbers of infected cattle analysed at only two post-partum time-points, a number of novel hypotheses have been generated that can now be tested in larger numbers of post-partum cattle with endometritis.
