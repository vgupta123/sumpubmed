BACKGROUND
zebrafish experimental models are now widely accepted for investigating human diseases, including epilepsy . importance of this animal model is mainly based on its remarkable features combining exceptionally simple genetic manipulations, which are ideal for forward and reverse genetic investigations, and easy phenotype assessment in a short period of time. other advantages of this fish species are as follows: low maintenance cost, easy breeding, high fecundity, external fertilization and development, short generation time, and transparency during embryonic and larval stage. furthermore, their genome shares approximately 70 % homology with the human genome comprising large regions of conserved synteny  <cit> .

zebrafish exposed to chemoconvulsant drugs mimic behavior, electrographic findings, and upregulation of c-fos in brain regions related to neuronal activation  <cit> . zebrafish are sensitive to common anticonvulsant drugs; therefore, they are widely used for the high throughput screening of novel antiepileptic drugs  .

evidence obtained using hippocampal surgical specimens from patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy and experimental rodent models demonstrated that proinflammatory cytokines and inflammatory mediators are upregulated after seizures, suggesting that the inflammatory response may play an important role in the pathophysiology of epilepsy . among the proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin- <dig> beta  is the most widely investigated. il-1β exerts its action by binding to the il- <dig> receptor, which initiates a downstream signaling process that activates the transcription factor nuclear factor-κb . activation of nf-κb leads to the transcription of multiple inflammation-associated genes, including cyclooxygenase - <dig> . cox- <dig> is a key enzyme responsible for the conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins, potent mediators of inflammatory signaling . one of these prostaglandins converted by cox- <dig> is prostaglandin e <dig> , which upregulates the expression of il-1β .

because a relationship between epilepsy and inflammation has been established and inflammatory response in the pentylenetetrazole -seizure model has not been studied, we investigated the expression of the il1b and cox <dig> transcripts in zebrafish after seizures. in addition, we measured the effects of indomethacin, a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug, on seizure latency, number of seizure-like behaviors, and c-fos expression used as a marker of neuronal activity  <cit> .

RESULTS

temporal expression profile of il1b was analyzed  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 48 h after ptz-induced seizures by comparing the control  and seizure  groups at each time point. we found a short-term upregulation of i11b mrna levels  <dig>  h  and 1 h  after seizures . however, no significant differences were found between the cg and sg  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  or 48 h after seizures  .fig.  <dig> temporal expression profile of il1b in the brain of zebrafish after pentylenetetrazole-evoked seizures. relative quantification of the interleukin- <dig> beta  transcript  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 48 h after pentylenetetrazole -induced seizures in the brain of zebrafish at 7 days post fertilization. each time-point seizure group was exposed to 15 mm ptz for 20 min, and their time-matched control groups were handled identically, but included exposure to water . data obtained from each seizure group was compared with their respective time-point matched control group. data are presented as mean ± sem. statistical analyses were performed using the mann–whitney test, and differences were considered significant if p <  <dig> . asterisk  indicates p ≤  <dig> . cg control group, sg seizure group



the mrna expression of cox2a and cox2b in the brain of zebrafish larvae after ptz-induced seizures
because no significant differences were found in the mrna expression of il1b pertaining to longer time periods, we chose to evaluate the temporal expression profile of cox2a and cox2b  <dig> ,  <dig>  and 6 h after ptz-induced seizures. our results showed that both cox2a and cox2b were constitutively expressed in the cg ; however, after ptz exposure, the expression pattern of these genes showed differences. animals in the cg and sg had similar cox2a mrna levels after seizures . however, cox2b mrna levels were upregulated  <dig>  h  and 1 h  after seizures in the sg compared with the corresponding data in the cgs . no statistical significance was found 6 h after seizures .fig.  <dig>

effect of indomethacin administered prior to ptz on the mrna expression levels of il1b,cox2b, and c-fos
we used indomethacin at three different concentrations  prior to seizure-induction, and we quantified the mrna levels of il1b, cox2b, and cfos  <dig>  h after ptz-induced seizures, when the transcript levels of il1b and cox2b are the highest. our results revealed that indomethacin treatment prior to ptz-induced seizures downregulated the mrna expression of il1b, cox2b, and c-fos. as shown in fig.  <dig>  expression of il1b was downregulated by indomethacin when we compared the sg with all indomethacin concentration tested . in addition, il1b mrna levels in the indomethacin-treated groups were similar to that in the cg. no significant difference was found between indomethacin treatment groups . the mrna expression of cox2b was upregulated in the sg  and 10 μm indomethacin group  when both were compared to the cg . indomethacin treatment at 307 μm significantly downregulated the mrna expression of cox2b compared with the sg . comparisons between indomethacin treatments groups showed that cox2b mrna levels were downregulated at 100 μm  and 307 μm  when compared to 10 μm . transcript level of c-fos was upregulated in the sg  and 10 μm indomethacin pretreated group  when compared to the cg . however, 100 μm  and 307 μm  indomethacin treatment downregulated the cfos mrna level when compared to the sg .fig.  <dig> indomethacin, administered prior to pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures, on il1b level in the brain of zebrafish. relative quantification of interleukin- <dig> beta  mrna expression level  <dig>  h after pentylenetetrazole -induced seizures in the brain of zebrafish at 7 days post fertilization. seizure group  comprised animals exposed to 15 mm ptz for 20 min. indomethacin groups  comprised animals that received indomethacin treatment prior to ptz. animals in the control group  were handled identically, but included exposure to water . data are presented as mean ± sem. statistical analysis was performed by one-way analysis of variance  with bonferroni’s post hoc test. three asterisks  indicate that p ≤  <dig> . cg control group, sg seizure group

seizure onset latency and the number of seizure-like behaviors
we evaluated the effect of indomethacin administered prior to ptz-induced seizures by analyzing seizure onset latency  and the number of seizure-like behaviors. each larva was observed individually under each experimental condition. in animals pretreated with  <dig>   <dig>  or 307 μm indomethacin, we found a significant increase of onset latency  compared with animals in the sg . furthermore, all indomethacin concentrations tested reduced the number of seizure-like behaviors compared with the ptz treatment alone .fig.  <dig> effect of indomethacin treatment prior to pentylenetetrazole induced seizures on seizure latency. animals were exposed to  <dig>   <dig>  or 307 μm indomethacin for 24 h prior to pentylenetetrazole -induced seizures, and latency of the first seizure-like behavior  was evaluated following visual observation. the seizure group  was composed of animals that were exposed to 15 mm ptz . data are presented as mean ± sem. statistical analysis was performed by one-way analysis of variance  with bonferroni’s post hoc test. one asterisk  indicated that p ≤  <dig> ; two asterisks  indicated that p ≤  <dig> ; three asterisks  indicated that that p ≤  <dig>

discussion
it has been demonstrated previously that seizures induce the upregulation of il-1β and cox- <dig> in clinical specimens and experimental models of epilepsy ; however, to reveal the main role of inflammatory molecules in epilepsy, further investigations are necessary. rodent models of epilepsy are widely used in experimental research, but due to its several favorable characteristics, zebrafish seizure models can significantly contribute to understanding the role of inflammation following seizures. in addition, zebrafish models of human diseases are particularly suitable for the pharmacological testing of drugs in a convenient way. immune and inflammatory responses in zebrafish are comparable to those found in mammals ; however, to our knowledge, no data is available about the expression of inflammatory biomarkers such as il1b and cox <dig> in zebrafish seizure models.

our results clearly showed that the expression of il1b is upregulated shortly after seizures in the larval brain . a previous study of minami et al.  <cit>  showed that the mrna levels of il-1β increase more rapidly when the seizure was induced by ptz compared with kainic acid in rodents. recently, järvelä et al.  <cit>  reported that the mrna level of il-1β is elevated for up to 24 h after status epilepticus  induced by kainic acid in rodents. our finding suggests that the transcription profile of il1b after ptz exposure in our zebrafish model is similar to that found in a rodent model of ptz-induced seizures.

because of evolutionary gene duplication, the zebrafish genome contains two functional cox <dig> genes termed as cox2a and cox2b  <cit> . the mrnas of cox2a and cox2b are constitutively expressed in numerous tissues, including the zebrafish brain  <cit> . in this study, we investigated the inducible expression of both cox <dig> genes after ptz-induced seizures. our results revealed a characteristic transcriptional response in both genes. expression of cox2b, but not cox2a, is upregulated immediately after ptz-induced seizures  and 1 h after the seizure in the brain of zebrafish . it is important to note that a study by ishikawa et al.  <cit>  showed that cox2b is more similar in structure to the mammalian cox <dig> than cox2a, which may explain our results  <cit> .

because the mrna levels of il1b and cox2b were upregulated after seizures, we investigated the effect of an anti-inflammatory drug administered prior to ptz-induced seizures. our results showed that indomethacin used at various concentrations downregulated the expression of il1b . this result is similar to the data obtained using the pilocarpine-induced model of epilepsy, wherein indomethacin administration prior to pilocarpine injection downregulates the expression of il-1β in rats  <cit> . in addition, we showed that indomethacin significantly downregulated the mrna expression of cox2b, but only at a concentration of 307 μm.

after showing that indomethacin was able to reduce the mrna levels of il1b and cox2b, we investigated if indomethacin reduces the convulsant effect of ptz . therefore, we assessed neuronal activity by measuring the mrna expression of c-fos, and we investigated seizure behavior during ptz exposure by analyzing the latency of seizure onset and the number of seizure-like behaviors, which are both well-known characteristics of seizures according to the literature  <cit> . the c-fos gene is a proto–oncogene, which is expressed rapidly and transiently in neurons following neuronal excitation such as that in seizures; therefore, expression of c-fos has been widely used as a marker for neuronal activity  <cit> . baxendale et al.  <cit>  showed that c-fos is a sensitive marker for investigating anticonvulsant properties of several pharmacological compounds. our results showed that indomethacin downregulated c-fos expression at  <dig> and 307 μm .

furthermore, indomethacin administered prior to ptz reduced the behavioral signs of seizure because it both increased seizure latency   and decreased the number of seizure-like behaviors for all indomethacin concentrations used in this study compared with the untreated group .

although our results clearly suggest that indomethacin has significant effects on several parameters related to seizure activity, we did not demonstrate that the anticonvulsant effect of indomethacin is caused exclusively by its anti-inflammatory action on il1b and cox2b; therefore, further studies are necessary to address this question.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown for the first time that transcriptional levels of two important inflammatory biomarkers related to epilepsy, il1b and cox <dig>  are upregulated in the brain of zebrafish after ptz-induced seizures. furthermore, we found that indomethacin exposure prior to ptz-induced seizures had an anti-inflammatory effect by reducing the mrna expression of il1b,cox2b, and c-fos, and by increasing seizure latency and decreasing the number of seizure-like behaviors.

taken together, our results demonstrate that the zebrafish seizure model is a valuable alternative model for studying the molecular mechanisms of inflammation and seizures and for the investigation of anti-inflammatory compounds that may have a potential therapeutic effect in seizure suppression.
