BACKGROUND
adipose tissue  can be divided into brown and white at  <cit> . the latter is now recognized as being more than an energy storage site. it is accepted as a highly active metabolic and endocrine organ  <cit>  comprising different cell types   <cit>  that actively secrete proteins involved in the regulation of energy, as well as neuroendocrine, autonomic, and immune functions  <cit> . these different cell types may contribute to the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha , interleukin  <dig> , interleukin  <dig> , chemokine ligand  <dig> , and anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin  <dig> , as well as hormones such as resistin, leptin, and adiponectin that are involved in the inflammatory response and insulin sensitivity  <cit> .

the at also secretes matrix metalloproteinases  which have a functional role in the development of the at  <cit>  and are important for the extracellular matrix remodelling, which occurs during obesity-mediated at formation, at least in mice  <cit> .

a study by fain and colleagues  <cit>  in obese women revealed that over 90% of the adipokine release by at, except for adiponectin and leptin, could be attributed to non-fat cells. when excessive amounts of at are deposited, inflammatory markers in the circulation can rise as result of the adipokine secreting ability of at. cinti and colleagues  <cit>  demonstrated that > 90% of all macrophages in white at of obese mice and humans were localized around dead adipocytes, forming crown-like structures . vick and colleagues  <cit>  first demonstrated an association between obesity and increased inflammatory markers  in horses, although age was also an important and possible confounding factor. currently, there is some controversy whether obesity in horses is or is not associated with low grade inflammation  <cit>  and there is no evidence whether cls do or do not form in the obese horse.

adipocyte size is positively correlated with frequency of adipocyte death, macrophage numbers, as well as cls in visceral and subcutaneous  depots in mice  <cit> , and leptin mrna expression in humans and cattle  <cit> . to the authors’ knowledge, size of adipocytes originating from different horse at regions has not been previously reported.

the specific site of at deposition is clinically very important. humans with a higher accumulation of visceral fat are at a higher risk for the development of obesity-related metabolic disorders  <cit> . similarly in horses, it has recently been demonstrated that expression of glucose transporters was influenced by at location in insulin sensitive and insulin resistant individuals  <cit> . it has also been suggested in equidae that at distributed specifically on the crest of the neck could indicate or contribute to hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance , and/or an increased risk for laminitis  <cit> . therefore, clinical interest on at in this region is increased in horses  <cit> . burns and coworkers  <cit>  found no differences in pro-inflammatory cytokine il-1β and il- <dig> mrna expression between insulin resistant and insulin sensitive horses. higher mrna concentrations of these two cytokines, however, were found in the nuchal ligament at compared to the other at depots sampled in that study.

our hypothesis was that mrna expression of inflammation-related genes varied across at depots. therefore, the first aim of this study was to compare adipocyte size and mrna expression between different equine at depots with special interest in the nuchal at region. the second aim was to investigate the presence of antigen presenting cells in equine at and any potential relationship with adipokine mrna expression.

RESULTS
animals
a variety of different breeds was chosen for this study . average age was 14 ± 7 years.

blood analysis
average glucose, insulin, and leptin levels were 106 ± 16 mg/dl,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mu/l, and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ng/ml respectively.

candidate reference gene selection and genorm analysis
to study depot-related variation in mrna expression in at, a very sensitive and specific technique is required, such as rt-qpcr  <cit> , because of the low yield of mrna isolated from at  <cit> . however, before comparing mrna expression profiles across samples, correction for variables such as quality and quantification of the starting material and enzymatic efficiencies must be carried out  <cit> . consequently, the need for accurate data normalization is crucial  <cit> . in human at, obesity and type  <dig> diabetes can exert a detectable influence on reference gene expression in sc and visceral fat depots  <cit> . this demonstrates that the expression level of reference genes is influenced by body region and health status of the test subject.

the efficiency of each rt-qpcr run was calculated from a relative standard curve based on a 5-point 5-fold cdna dilution series, and ranged between  <dig> and  <dig> %. linear correlation coefficients varied between  <dig>  and  <dig> .

one sample from the neck region, two from the sc region, and four from the abdominal region showed consistently higher transcription levels  compared to the other samples. amplification problems were considered to be the cause as the rna quantity and quality was comparable to the other samples of the same region . these  <dig> at samples were therefore excluded from further analysis. transcription levels across all at studied were almost similar for actb, gapdh, and rpl <dig>  which had higher cq values than hprt <dig>  sdha, and tuba4a. the raw gene expression data from the genes of interest were normalised using the geometric mean of the most stable candidate reference genes gapdh, hprt <dig>  and rpl <dig> 

depot-specific mrna expression
the present study investigated the at depot related mrna expression of inflammation-related genes in horses of different breeds, different ages, and with varying body condition or nutritional status. adipokine expression was primarily studied at the transcription level, which does not necessarily reflect the protein level and/or its activity. it should be mentioned that at is made up of multiple cell types  <cit> . the aim of mrna expression was not to examine the individual cell populations, but to consider at as a whole  <cit> .

leptin mrna expression was significantly higher in the three neck samples compared to the mesenteric at samples  ¼, n ½, n ¾: p =  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  respectively). in contrast, ccl <dig> and il- <dig> showed significantly lower mrna expression in the nuchal at compared to the mesenteric at . a significant lower expression of adiponectin mrna was found in the tail head at region compared to the nuchal at , retroperitoneal , and peri-renal at region . pro-inflammatory cytokine il-1β mrna expression was significantly lower in the loin at compared to the mesenteric and peri-renal at . a trend for lower mrna expression was found in the retroperitoneal at . the mmp <dig> mrna expression was significantly lower in the peri-renal region compared to at originating from n ¼ , n ½ , tail head  and loin region . mesenteric at had a significantly lower mmp <dig> mrna expression compared to n ½ , tail head  and loin at . retroperitoneal at had a significantly lower mmp <dig> mrna expression compared to the loin at . interleukin  <dig> tended to have a higher mrna expression in the n ½ at compared to mesenteric at . no significant at depot effect was found for superoxide dismutase   <dig> 

a correlation was found between plasma leptin and insulin concentrations . there was also a correlation between il- <dig> and il-1β in the nuchal at region  and the tail head region . higher leptin mrna expression in the nuchal at region compared to the mesenteric at suggests that nuchal at may contribute proportionally more to the overall leptin concentration in the horse. the strong correlation between leptin concentration and degree of ir  <cit>  supports the hypothesis that enlarged nuchal at indeed is an important risk factor for ir  <cit> . in a study of liburt and coworkers, decreased il- <dig> mrna in nuchal at was associated with increased insulin sensitivity  <cit> . higher nuchal at il- <dig> mrna expression together with a significant correlation between the expression of il- <dig> and il-1β in the nuchal at depot, could indicate that in horses, the nuchal at depot is an important contributor for gene expression of these pro-inflammatory markers whereas in humans, the visceral at is responsible for this  <cit> . if such expression leads to increased protein formation, then an increase in the size of nuchal at depot could potentially contribute more to the total body inflammatory status. in humans, elevated inflammatory cytokines such as tnf-α, il- <dig>  and il- <dig> play important roles in the development of obesity-associated ir  <cit> . if this is also the case in horses, it would further confirm the link between a high cresty neck score and ir.

lower adiponectin mrna expression in the sc region compared to the abdominal and nuchal region suggests that abdominal at and nuchal at may be more important for circulating adiponectin concentrations. differences between gene expression in the different at depots and the protein levels in the blood can be caused by differences at the translation level, which can be influenced by cytokines. bruun and colleagues  <cit>  showed that tnf-α and il- <dig> significantly decreased the human adiponectin mrna levels in vitro suggesting that endogenous cytokines may affect adiponectin. in the present study, however, no correlations between adiponectin gene expression and cytokine mrna expression were found.

chemotactic cytokine ccl <dig> mediates chemotaxis of different leukocytes, depending on the tissue protein levels. high levels of ccl <dig> can trigger cytokine release. in humans, ccl <dig> production is upregulated by inflammatory cytokines, such as il- <dig>  <cit> . in the present study, ccl <dig>  il- <dig>  and il-1β mrna expression was higher in the abdominal region, although no correlations between these cytokines were found. this could indicate that in horses, other cytokines regulate ccl <dig> production. higher mrna expression of ccl <dig>  il- <dig>  and il-1β in the abdominal at suggests that this at depot may be more important for the circulating levels of these cytokines. this is in contrast with the findings from burns and coworkers  <cit>  who found higher il-1β mrna expression in the nuchal ligament at compared with the other depots sampled in that study. it has been suggested that different reference genes should be tested in each study setup to find the most suitable one not influenced by the experimental treatment  <cit> . as candidate reference gene selection was different in the present study  and the burns’ study , it may mean that results from both studies cannot be simply compared.

in mice, many mmps are expressed by at and stromal vascular cells in a depot-specific manner  <cit> . higher mmp- <dig> mrna expression in the sc at suggests that in horses, this at depot is more stimulated to differentiate pre-adipocytes into adipocytes  <cit>  and extracellular matrix remodeling  <cit> .

in conclusion, different mrna expression of inflammation-related genes in different at depots suggests that at depots may be a driving force for total body inflammation. it is possible that if more fat is deposited in an at depot with high mrna expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as nuchal at with high leptin and pro-inflammatory il- <dig> mrna expression, this may contribute to a greater overall inflammation in that individual horse than if the fat had been deposited in an at depot with a low mrna expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. further research into the final translation of mrna expression of inflammation-related genes into adipokines will be necessary to correctly evaluate the impact of fat deposition at specific places in the horse body.

histology and immunohistochemistry
to the authors’ knowledge, adipocyte size and area in cross-section in different at regions in the horse body have not been previously reported.

adipocyte area and number of antigen presenting cells /adipocyte could not be determined in  <dig> samples from different at depots in  <dig> different horses due to technical cutting and staining difficulties . negative controls using isotype-matched nonsense antibody showed no staining.

average adipocyte size was 70 ± 7 μm, with the largest average adipocyte diameter being found in peri-renal at . average adipocyte area in cross-section was 3980 ± 1355 μm <dig>  peri-renal adipocyte area  was significantly higher compared to n ½ , n ¼  and tail head adipocyte area  . retroperitoneal adipocyte area  was significantly higher than n ½  adipocyte area. a significant lower number of apc/adipocyte was found in the n ½ at compared to the loin at  .

capping structures  , similar to cls  in mice), were found in  <dig> horses in  <dig> different at depots . in  <dig> horses  cls were found in multiple at depots.

clear differences in adipocyte area between at depots were found, which is in accordance with the findings in other species  <cit> . differences in adipocyte area can influence mrna expression  <cit> . significant correlations between mrna expression of inflammation-related genes and adipocyte area were also found in the present study between multiple at depots  and multiple genes , although no clear pattern could be determined.

in the subcutaneous region, apc/adipocyte was high compared to the nuchal and abdominal region. in humans, this is related to high adipocyte death and cls formation  <cit> , but in the current study, this relationship was not found. macrophage inflammation in at is also correlated with inflammation in humans  <cit> .

this is the first study describing capping structures  in the horse , probably similar to cls in mice and humans  <cit> . one limitation of the present study was the staining method used, as this labeled mhc ii molecules, which are not exclusively expressed on macrophages, but also on other apc such as monocytes, b-cells, and dentritic cells  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
despite the fact that mrna levels of inflammation-related genes were studied instead of protein levels, still interesting conclusions concerning the deposition of fat in various depots in horses could be drawn. the inflammatory profile in at clearly varies with its location in the horse’s body in horses of different breeds varying in age and nutritional status, suggesting that the total inflammatory status of the horse may be at least partly a reflection of the relative contribution of each at. the factors driving the interindividual differences in at distribution thus warrant further investigation.
