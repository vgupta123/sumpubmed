BACKGROUND
regulation of phosphorylation state is a mechanism for controlling the function, localization and stability of proteins in vivo and is critical for the regulation of essential processes such as polarity and morphogenesis, chromosome segregation, cytokinesis, and cell cycle control  <cit> . together, protein kinases  and protein phosphatases   provide precise temporal and spatial regulation of their target substrates. in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, the dynamic localization of ppases suggests that an extensive cross talk between these processes is critical for the proper execution of cell division  <cit> . however, many of the substrates and regulatory proteins that participate in this cross talk remain unidentified. insight into ppase function has lagged significantly in comparison to kinases since ppases:  frequently require regulatory proteins that determine their targeting to particular substrates, cellular location or process and  often exhibit considerable functional redundancy. in budding yeast, for example, ~90% of the known  <dig> ppases are non-essential  <cit> .

study of genetic interaction networks is a powerful means to get insight into gene function, and several high throughput methods were developed during the last decade to generate genome-wide maps of genetic interactions  <cit> . however, such maps are still missing for yeast ppases. to date investigations of ppase function in budding yeast have utilized mutations outside the catalytic site  <cit>  or probed genetic interactions using single or double knockout ppase mutations  <cit> . these approaches present constraints for large-scale analysis of ppase function since:  mutations outside the catalytic domain generally affect the formation of a specific class of holoenzyme or the ability to interact with co-factor required for the proper targeting of the ppase to a subset of substrates  <cit> , and  the use of knockout alleles, in addition to precluding the analysis of the essential ppases, may lead to promiscuous and/or low-affinity interaction of regulatory subunits with ppases of the same class. for these reasons, we designed a strategy based on a hypomorphic catalytic ppase mutation that uses the synthetic genetic array . this method generates a large number of double mutant combinations, and has been successfully used to identify genetic interaction networks in yeast in a wide range of cellular processes  <cit> .

in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae,  <dig> genes encode predicted or demonstrated catalytic subunits of ppases. only two of these ppases are clearly essential: the pp1-type ppase, glc <dig>   <cit> , and cdc <dig> , a dual-specificity phosphatase that regulates mitotic/meiotic exit  <cit> . we selected glc <dig> for our analyses since a framework of genetic and protein interactions exists from previous studies of conditional glc <dig> mutants, but a comprehensive large-scale genetic analysis had not yet been performed. glc <dig> critically regulates numerous processes such as glucose and glycogen metabolism, sporulation, chromosome segregation, meiosis, mrna transport, transcription, and amino acid biosynthesis  <cit> . a search in the biogrid database  returned a list of  <dig> proteins reported to physically interact with glc <dig>  some of these proteins are known substrates , while others are thought to be regulatory subunits . however, the functional significance of the majority of these interactions remains unclear. in contrast, only  <dig> genes have been reported to show genetic interactions with various glc <dig> mutants. the vast majority of these genetic interactions are dosage dependent and only  <dig> genes  have been reported to show synthetic lethal/sick interaction with different conditional glc <dig> alleles. the functional clustering of genetic interactions of conditional glc <dig> alleles suggests the majority of these mutations compromise specific aspects of glc <dig> function. as such, these alleles are highly suited for cell biology. however an unbiased large-scale analysis revealing a comprehensive picture of glc <dig> signaling in vivo requires a novel glc <dig> allele affecting many functions of glc <dig> at a time.

in an effort to further define the signaling network for glc <dig>  we created a novel glc <dig> catalytic mutant  suitable for sga. the glc7-e101q mutant exhibited slow growth and impaired glycogen accumulation on glucose, but no specific delay in the cell cycle. the impaired growth and defects in glycogen synthesis of the glc7-e101q mutant were rescued by introduction of a single copy of wild type glc <dig>  indicating that glc7-e101q is a recessive, hypomorphic allele. sga analysis revealed a broad network of  <dig> synthetic sick/lethal  interactions that encompassed all known glc7-regulated processes, and suggested additional previously unknown functions for glc <dig> 

RESULTS
creation of a catalytic-deficient glc <dig> mutant, glc7-e101q
glc <dig> is the sole essential member of the ppp family of ppases in budding yeast and members of this family share a conserved catalytic motif. residues in the glc <dig> catalytic domain  are evolutionarily conserved with human pp <dig> orthologs and the pp1-like bacterial λ-ppase . given the high degree of conservation in the catalytic residues, glc <dig> is expected to have catalytic characteristics similar to those of previously characterized pp1-type ppases. phosphate hydrolysis by pp <dig> occurs via a onestep reaction and is dependent on metal ion catalysts . this hydrolysis reaction  is dependent on a phosphoesterase motif dxhngdxxdngnhd/e  whose active residues are a general acid catalyst  and the carboxyl oxygen of two invariant aspartic acids   <cit> . similar to human pp <dig> and glc <dig>  λ-ppase  shares this conserved catalytic domain  and has been previously examined in structure-function analyses of the active residues in the catalytic pocket. mutation of either d <dig> or d <dig>  to a non-reactive asparagine residue  resulted in a catalytically dead enzyme in in vitro ppase assays. however, mutation of e <dig>  reduced the catalytic activity of λ-ppase ~ <dig> fold and impaired mn2+ recruitment, but did not significantly alter its substrate binding  <cit> . an e>q substitution in the equivalent residue of glc <dig>  is therefore predicted to reduce catalytic activity by perturbing the recruitment of the metal co-factor that enhances phospho-transfer. using human pp1c-γ as a template, we found that the conserved residues of glc <dig> in the cd1- <dig> regions form a tertiary structure very similar to human pp <dig>  furthermore, analysis of the 3-d model of the e101q mutation in glc <dig> indicated that the overall shape and size of the catalytic pocket was not significantly changed . we predicted that reduction of glc <dig> catalytic activity in vivo, as a result of the e101q mutation, would result in a recessive, hypomorphic glc <dig> allele suitable for an unbiased sga analysis.

glc7-e101q mutant exhibits slow growth but no appreciable cell cycle delay or defect in chromosome segregation
the introduction of a glc7-d91n mutation into diploid cells resulted in inviable haploid progeny by tetrad dissection . this finding is consistent with the previous observation that this mutation results in a catalytically dead form of the enzyme in vivo  <cit> . in contrast, haploid glc7-e101q colonies isolated by tetrad dissection were viable but consistently small compared to wild type  when grown on rich medium  . analysis of the growth curve for three haploid isolates of glc7-e101q indicated impaired kinetics compared to wild type cells . to determine whether slow growth was due to a delay in cell cycle progression, mutant and wild type cells from log phase cultures were harvested, stained with propidium iodide and dna content measured by facs analysis. as shown in figure 2b, facs analysis revealed that proportion of g <dig>  s, or m-phase cells in glc7-e101q cultures was not statistically different from that of wild type cells. this result correlated with the observation that proportion of unbudded, small-budded and large-budded cells was similar between wild type and glc7-e101q strains .

studies using conditional glc <dig> mutants have demonstrated a role for glc <dig> in the attachment of spindle microtubules to kinetochores during metaphase and chromosome segregation  <cit> . therefore, we next examined glc7-e101q cells for chromosome segregation defects and sensitivity to the microtubule-destabilizing agent, benomyl. to examine bi-orientation of sister chromatids, anaphase cells  expressing gfp-laci and centromeric repeats  of the lactose operon   <cit>  were examined by fluorescence microscopy. as shown in figure 2d, gfp-laci segregated to both spindle pole bodies  in a similar manner to wild type cells. we also examined for chromosome mis-segregation in glc7-e101q cells following several growth cycles using a sectoring assay  <cit> . wild type, glc7-e101q and ame1- <dig>  strains lacking a functional ade <dig> gene  were transformed with a centromeric fragment of chromosome iii containing the sup <dig> gene  and analyzed for loss of the fragment after 4-day incubation on ypd medium lacking adenine. the ame1- <dig> strain exhibited frequent chromosome loss as indicated by the appearance of red sectors in the colonies . in contrast, glc7-e101q and wild type colonies induced negligible loss of the circle iii/sup <dig> fragment, and the vast majority of colonies remained white in coloration . we also tested glc7-e101q cells for sensitivity to the microtubule-disrupting agent, benomyl. when compared to the wild type, glc7-e101q cells had consistently slower growth on both dmso control and benomyl plates. however, the slow growth of glc7-e101q was not exacerbated by benomyl treatment .

to investigate the possibility that the slow growth phenotype of glc7-e101q cells might be the result of either protein instability or changes in protein modifications to glc <dig>  whole cell extracts were examined by western blot analysis. protein extracts from strains expressing glc7-proa or glc7-e101q-proa fusion proteins were prepared from asynchronous cells  or from g <dig>  s and g2/m-arrested cells  and examined using anti-proa antibodies. the abundance of the glc7-e101q-proa mutant was not reduced relative to wild type glc7-proa by 1d immunoblot analysis . furthermore, in each case, a single isoform was identified for glc7-proa and glc7-e101q-proa in extracts derived from g <dig>  s and g2/m arrested cells . these findings indicate that the slow growth of glc7-e101q strains was not the result of protein instability or the accumulation of aberrant modifications to the glc <dig> protein.

glc7-e101q mutant is impaired in glucose metabolism
glc <dig> has a well-established role in glucose metabolism. the first conditional allele of glc <dig>  was isolated as a consequence of its defect in glycogen synthesis in the presence of glucose  <cit> , a phenotype that has, similarly, been observed for other glc <dig> mutants  <cit> . the failure to accumulate glycogen has been linked to impaired de-phosphorylation of the glycogen synthase, gsy <dig>  by glc <dig> and its targeting subunit, gac <dig>  <cit> . glc <dig> also plays an important role in glucose repression, a process that  leads to transcriptional repression of genes involved in the utilization of alternative carbon sources such as sucrose, galactose and maltose. conditional glc <dig> mutants such as glc7-t152k  <cit> , glc7-f256a, glc7-f292a, glc7-e <dig> l <dig>  <cit>  exhibit defects in glucose repression that is due, in part, to an impaired ability of the glc <dig> mutant to associate with the targeting subunit reg <dig>  in the presence of glucose, glc7-reg <dig> has been shown to de-phosphorylate and thereby, inhibit snf <dig> kinase, which is responsible for the transcription of several glucose-repressed genes  <cit> . we observed that glc7-e101q cells had a more significant growth defect in limited glucose  relative to its growth in rich medium . growth of glc7-e101q cells on both ypad and ypag was similar at 30°c and 37°c, indicating the glc7-e101q mutation does not induce temperature-sensitivity . glycogen content was assessed by iodine staining  <cit>  and revealed impaired glycogen accumulation for glc7-e101q cells . both the impaired growth and the glycogen accumulation defects of glc7-e101q were restored to wild type levels in strains that expressed an un-linked copy of wild type glc7:ura <dig> inserted at the ura <dig> locus .

to rule out the possibility that the poor growth of glc7-e101q observed on ypag is the consequence of a petite phenotype resulting from mitochondrial mis-function, tetrad analysis was performed on diploid cells heterozygous for glc7-e101q in a genetic background homozygous for a defective ade2Δ- <dig> gene. in the absence of adenine, ade2Δ- <dig> cells accumulate p-ribosylaminoimidazole, an intermediate of the adenine synthesis pathway. mitochondrial oxidation of this intermediate results in a red pigment which colors colonies  <cit> . we observed glc7-e101q spore colonies consistently accumulated this red pigment on medium lacking adenine demonstrating the presence of functional mitochondria . taken together, these results support that the glc7-e101q mutation is a stable recessive allele and exhibits impaired catalytic activity in vivo.

sga analysis of glc7-e101q reveals a broad genetic network encompassing glc7-regulated processes
in order to expand the genetic network of glc <dig> and to identify new candidate genes involved in glc7-dependent processes, we screened ~ <dig>  non-essential genes for synthetic interactions with glc7-e101q using the sga methodology . two-independent genome-wide screens revealed a total of  <dig> candidate synthetic sick/lethal  interactions . to confirm ssl genes identified, we utilized a modified spot assay version of random spore analysis described previously  <cit> . since glc <dig> has been shown to regulate sporulation  <cit>  and meiosis  <cit>  we wished to rule out the possibility that genes identified as ssl with glc7-e101q may have resulted from meiotic and/or sporulation defects due to haploinsufficiency for glc <dig>  to circumvent this problem, random spore analysis was performed using a query strain of glc7-e101q that contained glc7:ura <dig> under control of the endogenous glc <dig> promoter inserted in the ura <dig> locus  . using this methodology, mating, sporulation and selection of mata haploid progeny were performed under conditions in which wild type glc <dig> was co-expressed in the glc7-e101q mutant. following the selection of mata progeny, cells expressing wild type glc <dig> were eliminated by plating on 5-fluoro-orotic acid  medium which prevents the growth of cells expressing a functional ura <dig> gene  <cit> . plate scoring from the random spore analysis confirmed  <dig> genes as ssl with glc7-e101q. the ssl genes were then grouped into functional classes according to their biological process go  annotations deposited in the saccharomyces genome database . additional file  <dig> lists the  <dig> annotations encompassing  <dig> high-level go terms for the  <dig> ssl genes. using a hypergeometric distribution model  <cit> , the frequency distribution of the go terms identified for ssl genes was compared to those represented in the deletion array and examined for enrichment of particular biological processes . the set of ssl gene annotations was significantly enriched for  <dig> go-terms: organelle organization and biogenesis ; protein modification process ; anatomical structure morphogenesis ; nuclear organization ; and biogenesis and cell budding . since glc <dig> has been shown to play a role in all these processes, this suggests that the glc7-e101q mutant is defective in multiple aspects of the glc <dig> function.

to reveal the processes buffered by glc <dig>   <dig> of  <dig> genes interacting with the glc7-e101q mutant were manually grouped into  <dig> functional categories . the majority of these genes are implicated in critical cellular processes such as chromosome segregation, nutrient-sensing, stress response and mitochondrial function. the information currently available on the remaining set of genes is too fragmental to allow classification in any of the listed categories .

: s-adenosylmethionine

chromatin remodeling, chromosome segregation, dna damage, cell polarity and cytokinesis genes
a set of genes encoding histone-modifying proteins with a role in chromatin remodeling and transcription show ssl interaction with glc7-e101q. this group includes the histone h <dig> acetyltransferase rtt109/kat <dig>  the histone h <dig> methylase dot1/kmt <dig>  the component of the rpd <dig> histone deactylase pho <dig>  the subunit of the saga/slik complexes chd <dig> involved in histone acetylation, the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase fpr <dig> involved in histone h <dig> and h <dig> folding, the nucleosome remodeling factor asf <dig>  and the histone-associated factor uaf <dig>  these results are in agreement with a previous observation that doc1Δ glc7- <dig> double mutants exhibited a slow growth phenotype due to mis-regulation of histone h <dig> phosphorylation  <cit> . in addition, the loss of set <dig>  which encodes a histone methyltransferase, was also shown to cause lethality in glc7- <dig> cells  <cit> . collectively, these findings indicate that correct histone modification is required for the survival of glc <dig> mutants.

genes with a role in dna damage included components of chromatin remodeling complexes , the checkpoint signaling gene, mrc <dig>  subunits of dna-repair complexes  and dna-damage responsive genes . this set of genes emphasizes the requirement for proper chromosome segregation in glc7-e101q cells and the critical role of the dna-repair machinery during mitosis. several other genes identified indicate that glc <dig> plays a critical role in chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. genes in these categories include regulators of microtubule dynamics  and the cytokinetic actomyosin ring . in addition, axl <dig> and bud <dig> were identified which share a physical interaction and are implicated in cell polarity and cell-cycle control  <cit> . other genes involved in chromosome segregation included chromatid cohesion genes , the mini-chromosome maintenance gene, mcm <dig>  cytokinesis genes , components of the spindle checkpoint , subunits of the nuclear pore complex  and karyopherin genes . the identification of a wide-spanning range of genes involved in chromosome segregation supports that glc <dig> plays a prominent role in buffering against chromosome mis-segregation. this is supported by previous findings that loss of bud <dig>  <cit>  or mutation of the kinetochore protein, dam <dig>   <cit>  caused lethality of conditional glc <dig> mutants. furthermore, other data supports that glc <dig> plays a key role in regulating the attachment of kinetochore microtubules to chromosomes. it is postulated that this regulation occurs via glc7-dependent de-phosphorylation of kinetochore-localized proteins, such as ndc <dig> and other yet to be identified substrates  <cit> .

nutrient-sensing, stress response and mitochondrial genes
in accordance with glc7's prominent metabolic role, particularly glycogen accumulation and glucose repression, several genes involved in nutrient sensing, metabolism and stress response were identified. sip <dig> and the snf1-activating kinase sak <dig>  which are both involved in the regulation of snf <dig> kinase, were required for growth of glc7-e101q. sip <dig> physically interacts with both reg1-glc <dig> and snf <dig>  and is thought to regulate the interaction between glc <dig> and snf <dig>  <cit> . other nutrient sensing genes included gph <dig> , tdh <dig> , gpa <dig> , tpk <dig> , ssk <dig> , ckb <dig> and ckb <dig>  and various transport proteins . genes required for growth under stress conditions  are also in this group. these findings indicate that nutrient sensing and stress signaling pathways are required for the growth of the glc7-e101q mutant. this group of interactions can be related to a previous observation that mutation of rhr <dig>  encoding the dl-glycerol-3-phosphatase, is lethal when introduced in a glc7-y <dig> background  <cit> . in addition, epistasis and transcriptional analyses have shown a role for bud14-glc <dig> in the regulation of msn <dig>  a transcription factor controlling the expression of stress-response element -genes  <cit> .

genes with a role in mitochondrial activity and inheritance included subunits of the atp synthase , genes required for cytochrome-c oxidase function , genes involved in mitochondrial replication -transcription  and -translation , genes required for mitochondrial homeostasis/metabolism  and genes with a role in mitochondrial morphology and distribution . this group also contains genes that localize to the mitochondria  and may be required for optimal mitochondrial function. thus, mitochondrial function is essential when pp <dig> function is compromised.

transcription, protein synthesis and protein regulation genes
genes involved in transcription included transcription factors , elongator complex components , mediator complex components , a transcription termination factor  and rna processing factors . protein synthesis genes included components of the large ribosomal subunit , components of the small ribosomal subunit  and ybl054w, which is putatively involved in rrna synthesis. other genes were identified with various roles in protein modification such as protein glycosylation , ubiquitin-regulated protein degradation  and protein phosphorylation . all these genes likely play a role in the expression of and/or the modification/turnover gene products essential for processes buffered by glc <dig> 

the synthetic lethal interaction of glc7-e101q with the ppz <dig> phosphatase and two pp2a subunits  suggests an interplay between these phosphatases. few synthetic lethal interactions are currently available for ppz <dig>  ppm <dig> and rts <dig>  however, it was interesting to note that glc7-e101q and ppz <dig> share synthetic lethal interactions with both bim <dig> and bub <dig>  in addition, it has been previously suggested that an exchange of regulatory subunits between glc <dig> and ppz phosphatase may be the basis for the observed synthetic lethal interaction of glc <dig> with glc <dig> mutants and ppz <dig> ppz <dig>  <cit> . these observations support that signaling cross-talk occurs between these phosphatases.

vesicle transport, lipid metabolism and s-adenosylmethionine synthesis genes
genes with a role in vesicle transport included arf <dig> , bts <dig> , regulators of golgi vesicle targeting and fusion  and regulatory proteins involved in endocytosis . these interactions may indicate a requirement for the transport of specific cargo in the glc7-e101q mutant that are required for viability. alternatively, they may reflect a more direct role for glc <dig> in the regulation of vesicle transport. this is supported by previous studies that indicate a regulatory function for glc <dig> on components of vesicle trafficking. for example, glc <dig> and its targeting subunit, scd <dig>  were shown to regulate pan <dig>  an actin regulatory protein involved in endocytosis. interestingly, both pan <dig> and end <dig>  exhibited physical interactions with scd <dig>  implicating them in glc <dig> recruitment to sites of endocytosis  <cit> . in addition, a separate study demonstrated a role for glc <dig> in the regulation of snare protein complexes that are required for vesicle-membrane fusion  <cit> .

lipid metabolism genes identified included those functioning in ergosterol metabolism , fatty acid metabolism , phospholipid metabolism  and a set of genes for peroxisomal proteins . the intimate synthetic lethal relationships between lipid metabolism, mitochondrial function and vesicle transport genes is probably the basis for this set of ssl interactions.

genes involved in s-adenosylmethionine  -dependent processes included methyltransferases  and the sam decarboxylase spe <dig>  the deletion of these genes likely impacts on sam pool and this, in turn, affects glc7-dependent processes that utilize this co-factor such as histone methylation, ergosterol synthesis and phospholipid synthesis.

network analysis of the glc <dig> interacting genes
we performed a network analysis of the glc7-e101q ssl genes by examining protein-protein and genetic interactions available from the biogrid database . this analysis revealed  <dig> genes that are interconnected through  <dig> and  <dig> protein-protein and genetic interactions, respectively. based on protein-protein interactions, we identified  <dig> distinct molecular modules involving  <dig> glc <dig> genetic interactors . these modules are components of molecular machines involved in microtubule-based polarity, the spindle checkpoint, chromatin remodeling and transcription, translation, regulation of casein kinase  <dig>  regulation of the v-atpase, nuclear pore complex and nucleo-vacuolar transport. some modules are interconnected by genetic interactions among their components . for example, components of the "microtubule-based polarity", the "spindle checkpoint" and the "nuclear pore complex" modules show genetic interactions. this reflects how these modules cooperate during mitosis. in some cases, two modules are connected by genetic interaction with a gene that is not part of any module. for example, ctf <dig> and slx <dig>  both playing a role in the control of dna replication, connect via genetic interactions to the "microtubule-base polarity", "nuclear pore complex" and "remodeling/transcription" modules. finally, some modules, such as "npl4-otu1"  and "axl2-bud4", are not connected to any other module. this probably reflects that the map for genetic interactions is still incomplete and that some genes showing ssl interaction with glc7-e101q have not yet been screened by the sga. additional sga screens will be required to obtain a comprehensive interaction profile for these genes.

discussion
a number of studies support that glc <dig> plays a critical role in the regulation of several cellular processes such as cell polarity, chromosome segregation, cytokinesis, and cell cycle control  <cit> . however, the precise role of glc <dig> in the majority of these processes and the identity of glc <dig> substrates involved in the regulation of these events remains poorly understood. the lack of information regarding glc7's signaling network is due, in part, to a large disconnect between genetic and proteomic data available. currently, the number of protein-protein interactions reported greatly exceeds genetic interactions  <cit> . the genetic interaction space, however, is much more dense than the physical interaction network, and the number of ssl combinations for a given gene is estimated to be 4-times that of protein-protein interactions  <cit> . the high number of physical interactions and diverse phenotypes of conditional glc <dig> mutants suggest glc <dig> has a large and complex ssl interaction network.

in order to expand the genetic interaction data set for glc <dig>  we examined a novel catalytic mutant, glc7-e101q, for synthetic lethal interactions using sga. existing conditional glc <dig> alleles contain mutations outside of the glc <dig> catalytic domain that can alter the binding of regulatory subunits  <cit> , potentially resulting in allele-specific genetic interaction patterns. to achieve our goal to globally map the glc <dig> genetic interactions, a hypomorphic glc <dig> allele was constructed. based on 3-dimensional modeling and previous structure-function studies, the sga query mutant glc7-e101q was predicted to exhibit reduced catalytic efficiency while maintaining structural similarity to wild type glc <dig>  that two iron transporter genes , were found in our sga analysis suggested that a normal iron supply is important for the normal growth of the glc7-e101q mutant, and is consistent with the idea that this allele is catalytically compromised due to altered metal cofactor binding. furthermore, phenotypic analyses indicated glc7-e101q is a stable recessive hypomorphic allele. similar to some conditional glc <dig> mutants, glc7-e101q cells exhibited impaired growth in glucose-limited medium and defects in glycogen accumulation  <cit> . however, in contrast to other glc <dig> mutants that have been shown to have chromosome mis-segregation and cell cycle progression defects , glc7-e101q cells had no appreciable cell cycle delay or chromosome loss. these observations suggest a threshold effect may occur in glc7-e101q cells, such that weakened catalytic efficiency of glc <dig> is tolerated and/or compensated at differing levels depending on the cellular process and the demand for glc <dig> activity.

sga analysis of glc7-e101q resulted in a large number  of ssl hits in two separate screens. we expect that the large number of genes identified be due, at least in part, to the haploinsufficiency observed for glc7-e101q mutants, which resulted in reduced spore viability and placed constraints on colony scoring. to solve this problem and generate a high confidence dataset, we modified the confirmation procedure by creating a second query strain that expressed a selectable copy of wild type glc <dig> . sporulation, meiosis and growth of haploid progeny were performed in glc7-e101q cells expressing wild type glc <dig> inserted at the ura <dig> locus. pinning on counter-selective medium then eliminated haploid cells expressing the wild type glc <dig> allele. using this strategy, false positive hits were rejected and  <dig> hits were confirmed as true ssl interactions. we anticipate this strategy may be applicable to confirm sga screens of other query genes that interfere with sporulation or spore germination.

genes showing synthetic sick/lethal interactions with glc7-e101q were grouped in  <dig> functional classes. although only one  of  <dig> previously reported ssl interactions  for glc <dig> was identified in our analysis, a number of established glc7-mediated processes were captured in our screen. in particular, sets of genes fall into functional classes encompassing the  <dig> previously reported glc <dig> ssl interactions, which are chromatin remodeling, chromosome segregation/cytokinesis, and nutrient sensing/metabolism. in addition, certain ssl genes identified highlight events that appear to be directly regulated by glc <dig>  these include genes involved in glucose repression   <cit> , chromosome segregation   <cit>  and endocytosis   <cit> . lastly, our sga analysis of glc7-e101q provides a rich data set of genetic interactions that expands on previously known glc7-regulated processes, and the glc7-e101q synthetic interaction pattern reveals new facets of glc <dig> function. for example, the requirement for mitochondrial and phospholipid metabolism genes when glc <dig> function is compromised suggests a role for glc <dig> in these processes.

CONCLUSIONS
to uncover the genetic interaction network of the essential pp <dig> gene glc <dig>  a novel catalytic mutant allele, glc7-e101q, was used in an unbiased genome-wide screen for ssl interactions. we found  <dig> genes whose deletion was detrimental for the growth of glc7-e101q. functional grouping of these genes and analysis of their physical and genetic interaction expand the genetic network of established glc7-regulated processes and suggest novel regulatory roles for glc <dig>
