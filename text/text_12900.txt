BACKGROUND
numerous strategies have been used in an attempt to sift through the vast amounts of data produced from microarray expression studies  <cit> . there has been much interest given to the identification of bimodally expressed mrna transcripts, particularly in the context of cancer, where two distinct populations of patients can be defined by differing levels of a set of specific transcripts. these make excellent candidate biomarkers and often tend to show good correlation between transcript and protein abundance  <cit> . to this end, statistical approaches using mixture-model based clustering combined with either akaike information criterion  or the bayesian informatics criterion  have frequently been applied  <cit> . one method based on systematic classification of gene expression profiles has been applied to over  <dig>  microarray samples  <cit> . these methods have a strong theoretical base and have proven successful in identifying bimodality. however, they do depend on the investigator having a relatively high level of statistical understanding  <cit> . in this study we suggest a simple screening approach based on hierarchical clustering to identify bimodally expressed transcripts from microarray expression data that can be used alongside more complex approaches. while this method is not motivated by statistical theory, it appears to work well and is easily understood by laboratory scientists with only basic statistical training, who are in a good position to immediately follow up their results experimentally.

the matrix metalloproteinase, mmp <dig>  is one of the most abundant proteases in the matrix metalloproteinase family. it is capable of degrading type i, ii and iii collagens, and is one of only four mmps able to degrade triple helical collagens. it therefore plays a pivotal role in extracellular matrix  remodelling in both normal development and pathology  <cit> . mmp <dig> is tightly regulated at both the transcriptional and post-translational levels. it is produced as a zymogen that is activated by serine proteases and its activity is regulated by inhibitors such as the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase's , which compete with the substrate for the enzyme active site  <cit> .

mmp <dig> plays a clinically important role in inflammatory disease, and has been implicated in numerous pathological processes including wound healing  <cit> , tumour metastasis  <cit>  and arthritis  <cit> . the mmp- <dig> gene  <cit>  contains a 1g/2g polymorphism in its promoter at - <dig> from the transcriptional start site  <cit> . this polymorphism has been associated with increased mmp- <dig> expression in several cell types including; melanoma, stromal fibroblast, mcf-7/adr breast cancer cells  <cit> , and with several pathologies including: tumour metastasis  <cit> , arthritis  <cit> , periodontitis  <cit> , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  <cit>  and cardiovascular disease  <cit> .

using our simple clustering method to examine rna transcript abundance in huvecs isolated from  <dig> different human individuals, we identified mmp <dig> as one of a small group of rnas expressed in a bimodal manner in both un-treated endothelial cells, and in endothelial cells treated by inflammatory mediators. our results suggest that the regulation of mmp <dig> expression is a complex process that is modulated by a promoter polymorphism around the binding sites for several tfs including ets <dig>  ets <dig> and gata <dig> 

RESULTS
identification of mrna transcripts with bimodal expression patterns among a set of individuals
bimodally or multimodally expressed mrna transcripts were defined as those transcripts for which two or more distinct populations of expression values were observed among a set of individuals. to identify and visualise bimodally expressed transcripts, we devised a simple algorithm  based on unsupervised agglomerative hierarchical clustering. the algorithm can be used as either a simple 'r' script, or for use in graphical user interface it can be supplied as a genepattern module on request . it is illustrated schematically in figure  <dig> and described in the methods section. briefly, on a transcript-by-transcript basis, agglomerative hierarchical clustering across the dataset was carried out. the maximum cluster branch height identified for each transcript was approximately proportional to the greatest distance between the any two clusters of individuals, and is used here a surrogate marker for the degree of bimodal expression. to estimate the probability of transcripts appearing to be bimodally expressed due to chance alone we used a parametric bootstrapping method. related methods where trees are constructed from re-sampled data have been used previously to assess the reliability of clusters in gene expression data  <cit> . as is often the case with microarray transcript abundance data, our log-transformed data approximated a normal distribution. therefore, for each transcript we made a maximum likelihood estimate of the parameters of a normally distributed population from which the sample of individuals being studied may have been drawn. these parameters  were then used to generate  <dig>  simulated datasets for the transcript, each of which was clustered as described above. from the  <dig>  clustering results we identified how frequently the largest distance between clusters ≥ the largest distance between clusters in the actual data set. this information is used generate an empirical p-value as an estimate of type i error rate.

this algorithm was applied to two rna microarray data sets:  data from huvecs from  <dig> different human individuals cultured to passage  <dig> in standard conditions  and  data from passage  <dig> huvecs from nine different human individuals cultured with a cocktail of  <dig> ng/ml tnf-α, il-1β and il- <dig> for  <dig> hours . the bimodally expressed rnas found in the ut and im huvecs are listed in additional file  <dig>  the relationship between the maximum branch height  and the -log <dig> transformed empirical p-value  is shown in figure 2a-b. in each of the un-treated and im-treated data sets, a relatively small group of transcripts with high maximum branch height and high -log <dig> p were identified. we decided to accept an estimated type i error rate of 10% for each of these data sets, and found there were  <dig> rna transcripts for which the empirical p-values were ≤  <dig>  in both the un-treated and im-treated data sets . a table of features for each of the  <dig> shortlisted rna transcripts is given in additional file  <dig> 

these shortlisted transcripts were further assessed using several strategies including; i) visual inspection of histograms on a gene by gene basis ; ii) evaluation of the associated bootstrap p-values obtained during clustering and iii) consideration of additional information of biomedical interest. we were especially interested in the presence of promoter snps, which may in theory cause bimodal rna expression patterns, for example using the snper  <cit>  or rsnps  <cit>  databases. based on all these considerations, subset of transcripts were selected to take forward for further investigation; ddx3y , mmp <dig> and slc2a <dig> .

ddx3y is differentially expressed on the basis of its location on the y-chromosome
the pool of individuals examined was expanded and the abundance of ddx3y, mmp <dig> and slc2a <dig> mrna in huvecs from  <dig> additional individuals cultured in both ut and im conditions was analysed using quantitative reverse transcription-pcr . we confirmed in this new group of individuals a bimodal expression pattern for ddx3y using q rt-pcr. ddx3y is encoded by a y-chromosome gene and, as expected, its expression segregated with the gender of the individual from which the huvec were isolated in both the im and ut data .

mmp <dig> is differentially expressed and differentially active in endothelial cells
mmp <dig> was of particular interest since it encodes a biologically and clinically important enzyme, and since analysis of the rsnps database identified several common snps in the mmp <dig> gene promoter within  <dig>  bp upstream of the start of transcription . dendrograms for mmp <dig> in un-treated and im-treated huvecs, along with histograms of the maximum cluster branch height in each of  <dig>  parametric bootstrap data sets  are shown in figure  <dig>  quantitative rt-pcr from  <dig> additional individuals confirmed in this new group of individuals a bimodal expression pattern for mmp <dig>  we identified two distinct populations;  huvecs isolated from  <dig> of the  <dig> individuals had low mmp <dig> mrna abundance , however in  <dig> of these  <dig> individuals, mmp <dig> mrna abundance was significantly increased by culture in im conditions .  the remaining  <dig> individuals had relatively higher mmp <dig> mrna abundance regardless of ut or im culture conditions . in the high mmp <dig> expressing huvecs isolated from these  <dig> individuals, the abundance of mmp <dig> mrna was either not significantly affected or was decreased by im culture conditions . this differential response to inflammatory mediator treatment was striking and we sought to understand the underlying mechanisms.

to investigate whether the bimodal expression of mmp <dig> mrna was also evident at the level of mmp <dig> enzymatic activity, this activity was measured in  <dig> huvec isolates. the activity of mmp <dig> was low in those huvec cultures that had low mmp <dig> rna abundance and high in those huvec cultures that had high mmp <dig> rna abundance .

mmp- <dig> gene promoter polymorphisms segregate with mmp <dig> expression and enzymatic activity
a 1g/2g deletion/insertion polymorphism at position - <dig> in the mmp- <dig> promoter has been associated with differential expression of this gene in fibroblast and melanoma cells, with the 2g genotype associated with higher basal levels of mmp <dig> mrna  <cit> . this polymorphism occurs within a consensus binding site for the ets family of transcription factors  <cit> . therefore, direct dna sequencing of the mmp <dig> promoter was carried out to determine whether the mmp <dig> mrna abundance and activity profiles segregated with this promoter polymorphism. we determined mmp <dig> mrna level, mmp <dig> enzymatic activity and mmp <dig> promoter genotypes in huvecs from  <dig> different individuals. figure  <dig> and table  <dig> illustrate the three genotypes observed in these individuals. of the  <dig> individuals, 76% were heterozygous at the site of the promoter polymorphism, 15% were homozygous for the 1g allele, while only 9% were homozygous for the 2g allele. all 1g homozygous individuals segregated with low basal expression and activity of mmp <dig>  whereas all but one of the heterozygotes and homozygous 2g individuals segregated with high basal expression and activity of mmp <dig> 

elevated mmp <dig> expression induced by inflammatory mediator in 1g homozygous cells is not due to greater overall activity of pro-inflammatory signalling pathways
it was possible that the differential responses to im treatment we observed between individuals with low mmp <dig> basal expression  and high mmp <dig> basal expression  were simply due to differential activity of the signalling pathways that mediate inflammation. therefore, molecules known to be downstream of inflammatory mediator signalling were assessed as biomarkers of inflammatory pathway activity in individuals with low and high mmp <dig> basal expression. protein expression levels in icam <dig>  iкbα and phospho-iкbα were measured in huvec lysates from three individuals with low basal mmp <dig> mrna and three with high basal mmp <dig> mrna, after treatment with  <dig> ng/ml il-1β, tnf-α and il- <dig> for up to  <dig> hrs. figure  <dig> shows abundance of icam- <dig>  total and phospho-iкbα over the  <dig> hr period. two-way analysis of variance  revealed that there was no significant difference in icam <dig> or total and phospho-iкbα signal between the high and low expressers at all time points . these results suggest that there is not a large systematic difference between the inflammatory signalling pathways related to this polymorphism.

ets <dig>  ets <dig>  fos and gata <dig> are potential mediators of the different expression levels of mmp <dig> mrna in 1g -vs- 2g individuals
to determine whether differential binding of transcription factors to the mmp <dig> promoter region containing the - <dig> polymorphism is a potential mechanism for the differential response of mmp <dig> to im treatment, the tfsearch algorithm  <cit>  was used to identify putative transcription factor binding sites in this region. this analysis revealed in addition to the ets binding domain spanning the polymorphic region, ap- <dig> and gata <dig> binding sites were located  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp respectively downstream from the polymorphism. to determine whether these tfs actually bind to this region of the mmp <dig> gene promoter, immunoprecipitation using antibodies against c-fos, ets <dig>  ets <dig> and gata <dig> was carried out in huvecs isolated from two individuals of 1g genotype and in huvecs isolated from two individuals of 2g genotype cultured in both im and ut conditions. quantitative pcr was used to measure the enrichment of the immunoprecipitated region , relative to a  <dig> bp region positioned  <dig> bases upstream of the polymorphism that contained no relevant motifs. dna precipitated by anti-c-fos, anti-ets <dig>  anti-ets <dig> and anti-gata <dig> antibodies was enriched for the mmp <dig> promoter region containing the polymorphism, relative to the control upstream region and relative to the un-immunoprecipitated material in all four individuals and in cells cultured in ut and im conditions . the aim of this experiment was to identify potential tf binding around the polymorphism, not to compare the degree of enrichment between ig and 2g individuals or between ut or im cultured cells, which was impossible due to the small study size and variable degree of enrichment between individuals . nevertheless, it was interesting to observe that, consistent with the previously published role of ets <dig> in mmp- <dig> induction  <cit> , ets <dig> binding was reproducibly enriched in the 1g isolates treated with im.

discussion
the significance of non-coding polymorphisms in pathology is being increasingly recognised, with much research being carried out to identify the functional importance of the millions of snps mapped to date in the human genome  <cit> . this study suggests a complementary strategy, whereby we first identified those transcripts that showed bimodal expression levels, and then identified the polymorphism responsible for this differential expression. clustering methods  <cit>  and statistical methods  <cit>  have previously been used to identify bimodal expression in large datasets. these methods have the advantage of being motivated by strong theoretical statistical considerations. however, they also require a moderate level of statistical understanding, and in addition some of these methods can only be easily applied to large-scale meta-analysis of several data sets  <cit>  and may be less suitable for small expression data sets generated in a single laboratory. the approach we suggest is able to be used alongside more complex approaches by laboratory scientists with only basic statistical training, who are in a good position to immediately follow up their results experimentally. we believe that for bioinformatic tasks such as this, providing several complimentary methods that span the continuum of statistical complexity is important in order to bridge the gap between experimental biologists and statisticians.

our clustering strategy successfully identified the abundance of several mrna transcripts including mmp <dig> as bimodally distributed in human endothelial cells in both resting and inflammatory mediator-treated conditions. up-regulated mmp <dig> expression has been associated with many pathologies in which endothelial cells are involved  <cit> . we sequenced the region spanning the well characterised polymorphism at - <dig> from the transcription start site in the mmp- <dig> promoter  <cit>  and found that this polymorphism was strongly associated with the bimodal expression observed in the huvec dataset. individuals either homozygous or heterozygous for the 2g polymorphism at - <dig> possessed constitutively higher levels of mmp <dig> , implying a dominant effect of the 2g allele. this contrasts with previous findings in fibroblasts, where marginal differences in the basal levels of mmp <dig> between the 1g and 2g isolates were observed  <cit> .

inflammatory mediator treatment revealed a differential response in mmp <dig> stimulation between huvec isolates homozygous for the 1g allele and those possessing the 2g allele. whereas mmp <dig> mrna levels were increased in all isolates homozygous for the 1g allele; in isolates possessing the 2g allele, mmp <dig> mrna levels were essentially unchanged . regulation at the level of mmp <dig> enzyme activity mirrored this response to inflammatory mediator treatment. one possibility is that mmp <dig> expression is at maximum levels in the 2g isolates, even under the basal condition. in leukocytes continuously treated with high doses of inflammatory mediators , mmp <dig> mrna levels are genotype independent  <cit> . whether this is the case in huvecs remains to be determined.

chromatin immunoprecipitation  was conducted to investigate the potential involvement of tfs that have putative response elements spanning the polymorphism. we found that three tfs bound to this polymorphic region of the mmp <dig> promoter in endothelial cells. using nuclear extracts from fibroblast and a <dig> melanoma cells, rutter et al. previously demonstrated that recombinant ets <dig> binds strongly to the 2g promoter and weakly to the 1g promoter and that this binding is dependent on cooperation with an adjacent ap <dig> site at - <dig>  <cit> . their study along with others have revealed that several members of the ap <dig> family, including c-jun, fra and fos, are involved in the heterodimmer complexes bound at this cooperative ap <dig> site  <cit> . while the limited chip analysis we have performed clearly indicated that gata <dig>  fos, ets <dig> and ets <dig> do indeed bind to this region of the mmp <dig> promoter, further studies using larger numbers of individuals will be required to identify differential binding between genotypes or cell culture conditions.

CONCLUSIONS
identifying the functional importance of the millions of human snps is becoming a major challenge. simultaneously, the amount of available rna transcriptome data is rapidly growing, driving scientists to devise new methods to extract the most biologically and clinically useful information from rna abundance profiles. therefore, a strategy that identifies functionally important snps by virtue of the bimodal abundance across the human population of the associated mrnas is potentially very useful. here, we discuss a simple method based on hierarchical clustering to identify bimodally expressed transcripts, which may be used with either microarray or rnaseq data. this method complements more statistically complex approaches and is suitable for use by laboratory scientists with only basic statistical training, who are in a good position to immediately follow up their results experimentally. this strategy identified bimodal endothelial cell expression of several transcripts including mmp <dig>  which appears to be biologically significant with implications for inflammatory disease and for understanding the complex relationships between tfs and polymorphic promoter elements.
