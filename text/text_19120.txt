BACKGROUND
micrornas  are short, ~ <dig> nt non-coding rnas that control gene expression. mirnas bind to the 3'utrs of their regulated mrna transcripts to facilitate mrna degradation or translation inhibition  <cit> . mirnas are present in most metazoans and are thought to regulate a diverse range of biological processes  <cit> . mirna genes' evolution is unique since they mostly emerge through duplication events  <cit> ; exhibit most often unidirectional evolution  <cit> ; are generally gained and not lost  <cit> ; show several cases of rapid evolution in primates  <cit> ; are rarely changed due to functional constraints  <cit> ; and, show relatively rare evolutionary acquisition events .

mirna predictions based on computational methods, which followed initial extensive cloning efforts, are based on the secondary structure of the mirna, its phylogenetic conservation and thermodynamic stability  <cit> . mirna gene repositories are constantly expanding giving rise to more than  <dig> reported mirnas in more than  <dig> animal species . however, it is apparent that even this comprehensive repository is far from completion, accounted by the very few mirnas listed for dog  and chimpanzee , compared to human , to name two examples. since these differences cannot be accounted merely by species-specific mirnas, we saw the need for a computational tool for mirna homologous searches.

implementation
we present mirnaminer, a tool for automatic identification of homolog mirnas based on a given user defined query mirna. the tool exploits numerous characteristics of mirnas: high conservation of precursor sequences, very high conservation of mature sequences , and hairpin secondary structure with high folding energy and base pairing. mirnaminer first uses blast  <cit>  to select candidate matches and ranks them according to their e-values. then it employs a series of rigorous filters to improve specificity.

an input query consists of a precursor mirna, mature mirna, a set of filter threshold values and the number of best-fitted results requested in the output. we designed mirnaminer's algorithm to maximize specificity of matches. this is because the designed application of mirnaminer is to identify homolog matches after a mirna has been experimentally confirmed. we estimated the default values presented below so that each filter by itself selects 95% of known mirnas in training genomes .

mirnaminer's algorithm follows these steps:  use blast  <cit>  to find matches in target genomes ;  filter with e-value threshold ;  extend the match by adding flanking nucleotides  up- and down-stream from the match . examine all possible extensions of the match within threshold length ;  filter with rna secondary folding energy threshold ;  filter with minimal base-pairing threshold ;  filter with requirement for hairpin-shape secondary structure;  filter with alignment of precursor sequences ;  filter with alignment of mature mirna sequences ;  filter with maximum number of mismatches in mature mirna sequences ;  filter with conservation of seed ;  filter with position of mature mirna on the hairpin . mirnaminer's output includes detailed analysis of the identified genomic region that passed the selected threshold criteria . currently, mirnaminer supports searches in  <dig> metazoan genomes. we will regularly add additional genomes upon their release. after the query is issued, results are usually available within a minute  and can either be viewed on the screen or requested to be sent by email.

RESULTS
we used mirnaminer to perform a comprehensive homology search for mirna precursors in seven species . for the search, we used all  <dig> vertebrate mirnas listed in the sanger mirna registry . table  <dig> shows the summary information of mirnas listed in the sanger registry and of new, or non-registered, mirnas identified by our method. we identified  <dig> non-mirbase registered mirnas with major contributions to chimp , dog  and cow , vastly increasing their known mirna repertoire and possibly opening new research facets in these species . table  <dig> presents the mirna candidates that our method identifies in human . it is of interest that  <dig> new candidate mirnas in human were identified, despite many previous exhaustive human mirna identification studies  <cit> , possibly due to recent non-human/primate mirnas identification  <cit> , updated assembly of the human genome , and the modification of search parameters as implemented in mirnaminer.

the column 'mirna registry  <dig> ' shows the number of mirnas listed for the given species in the sanger mirna registry release  <dig> . the column 'newly identified' shows the number of mirnas candidates identified by mirnaminer.

the results are sorted according to e-values . lengths refer to lengths of mirna precursors. for each result, the table shows position, rna fold quality and the identity ratio of the discovered mirna candidates to the homolog in the original species. the existence of two occurrences for mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  indicates that two origins  of the same mirna were found in homo sapiens.

we compared our predicted mirnas  to other prediction methods. we found that  <dig> and 36% of our mirnas are contained within rnamicro  <cit>  and berezikov  <dig>  <cit>  databases, respectively, out of almost  <dig> and  <dig> mirnas in each set, respectively. the overlap is not extensive however even when mirnas derived from algorithms using very similar search parameters are compared only about 50% overlap is seen  <cit> . one of our identified mirnas, which is not reported by any other study, was recently identified experimentally  increasing confidence in our unique mirnas. notably, even though mirnas from all species were used to search for human homologs, the candidate mirnas discovered are homologs to genes in two species only, m. musculus and r. norvegicus, indicating better mirbase coverage for mouse and rat than for other species. two examples of the non-registered human homolog mirna genes are presented in figure  <dig>  mirbase mouse mir- <dig> sequence, which has no known registered homologs was used as input for mirnaminer search . the output reported a homolog , which is located in the second intron of human serotonin receptor 2c . the mouse mirna homolog is located in an intron of the same gene  suggesting an evolutionary conserved co-expression of mirna and its host gene  <cit> . second in the list of non-registered human homolog mirna genes  is mir- <dig>  this mirna spans the longest complementary sequence out of the list, has the lowest rna folding energy  and shows high conservation between many species . interestingly, human mir- <dig> is harboured in an intron of the high mobility group at-hook  <dig> oncogene . recent disrupted interplay between mirnas and hmga <dig> showed an increase in oncogenesis  <cit> . to regulate their targets, mirnas bind to 'seed' regions in the 3'utr, typically 6– <dig> nt long . mir- <dig>  possibly also co-expressed with its host gene  <cit> , has a conserved binding site for its own harboured mirna . it is tempting to speculate a negative feedback regulatory role of newly identified human mir- <dig> and its oncogenic host when co-expressed in the same spatio-temporal context. to this end data from expressed sequence tags  supports this possibility . other identified mirnas presented in table  <dig> show high species conservation  or are located in exons  or exon-intron junctions . interestingly, in a recent study involving deep sequencing, four of our human predicted mirnas were confirmed . to conclusively confirm the presence of the identified candidates in the studied species, an experimental verification is required. however, the candidates identified by our method are close homologs to known mirnas and as such are not required to meet as stringent criteria to be annotated as novel mirnas  <cit> . in this study we looked at homolog genes which are genes related to each other by descent from a common ancestral dna sequence. we do not segregate between orthologs, genes in different species that evolved from a common ancestral gene by speciation, and paralogs, genes separated by the event of genetic duplication. we cannot also rule out that similar mirnas in different species have developed independently  <cit> . our tool, which is based on evolutionary conservation, can only detect evolutionarily conserved mirna genes. we are currently improving our algorithm to include multiple alignments of vertebrate mirna sequences in order to better refine the boundaries of the mirna precursor sequence.

for searches with relaxed parameters  we suggest initially performing the following modifications:  do not 'require seed conservation in mature mirna ' ;  increase 'maximal number of gaps in mirna precursor alignment' from  <dig>  to 15;  decrease 'minimal mature mirna identity' from  <dig>   to  <dig> ;  decrease 'minimal base pairing percentage in mirna precursor' from  <dig>  to 40; and  change 'minimal/maximal length of precursor sequence ' from 70/ <dig>  to 50/ <dig>  in order to view mirnas which are other than the top candidate we suggest increasing the 'number of results to report' from  <dig>  to  <dig>  the parameters  above are listed in the order that would output an increasing total number of identified mirnas. for example, reducing mature mirna identity from  <dig>   to  <dig>  increases mirnas from  <dig> to  <dig>  and  <dig> to  <dig>  in human and mouse, respectively. on the other hand, we found that changing the length of the mirna precursor from 70– <dig> nt  to 50– <dig> nt, added only  <dig> additional mirna in human and none in mouse. this, however, might change when run in combination with other modified parameters. altogether each of the modified parameters listed above will result, independently, in an average mirna increase of 11% when tested on seven mammalian species.

we estimated mirnaminer's sensitivity  and specificity. the sensitivity, on seven mammalian species, is  <dig> . sensitivity for a species is the portion of the species' mirnas with known homologs that are detected by mirnaminer using mirnas from all other species. we used only mirnas which mirbase lists for more than one species. sensitivity measures are higher in chimp , mouse  and rat  than in human . to estimate specificity, we used mirnaminer to search for mirna homologs in c. elegans, which has a large evolutionary distance from the studied mammals. we treated as false positives all hits reported by mirnaminer that were not identified as homologs by previous studies. this conservative treatment may over-approximate the number of false positives. using  <dig> mirnas from the seven studied mammalian species, mirnaminer detected, in c. elegans, two known homologs  and reported only five false positives.

the second  column presents the number of mirnas with homologs that mirnaminer detects  in each species.

CONCLUSIONS
several approaches to identify mirna homologs have been previously described, both in plants  <cit> , and in animals  <cit> . however, the only tool that is available as a web service, microharvester  <cit> , is targeted for plants. mirnaminer is the first available mirna gene homolog search tool for animal genomes.
