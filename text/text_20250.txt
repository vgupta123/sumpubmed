BACKGROUND
the inward rectifier potassium channel irk1/kir <dig>  helps controls cell excitability through setting the resting membrane potential  <cit> . its dominant role of inward rectification for the normal function of skeletal and cardiac muscles is shown by the complete loss of inward rectifying current and k+-induced dilations in arterial myocytes from kir <dig>  knockout mice  <cit>  and periodic paralysis, and by cardiac arrhythmias in anderson's syndrome caused by point mutation of human kir <dig>   <cit> .

kir <dig>  expression is detected in excitable cells in brain, heart, and skeletal muscle in both mouse and chick  <cit> . in addition, chicken irk <dig>  is expressed in the cochlea  <cit> , a feature not observed in mammals  <cit> . in this report, we first analyzed cirk <dig> genomic dna to identify transcriptional initiation sites and distinct motifs that are important for the expression of this potassium channel gene. using in vitro promoter assays with fragments of the cloned cirk <dig> locus, we also identified several candidate control domains that may participate in regulating the channel's exquisite tissue-specific transcription.

RESULTS
structure of the chick irk <dig> genomic locus
we began this study by isolating cirk <dig> genomic clones from a chicken genomic dna phage library. a series of overlapping clones were isolated by screening the library using full length cirk <dig> cdna as a specific probe. approximately  <dig>  kilobase pairs  of the cirk <dig> 5'-flanking region were sequenced , including exon  <dig> and a portion of the intron. cirk <dig> contains two exons: exon  <dig> includes only upstream non-coding sequence  while exon  <dig> includes 5'utr , the full open reading frame , and the 3'utr  . the single intron is estimated to be approximately  <dig>  kb in length. a comparison of the cdna and genomic sequences shows the splice site to be located between positions  <dig> and  <dig> of cirk <dig> cdna . sequence data also showed that the intron had consensus donor  and acceptor  sequences . this genomic structure of the cirk <dig> locus resembles that of mkir <dig>   <cit> , which possesses two exons separated by a  <dig>  kb intron. in a previous report  <cit> , an approximately  <dig>  kb cirk <dig> transcript was detected, in addition to one  <dig>  kb in length, in brain, cerebellum, heart, skeletal muscle, and cochlea. since we have identified polyadenylation signals at bp positions  <dig> – <dig>  and  <dig> – <dig>  of the cdna, we conclude that cirk <dig> has  <dig> exons and no additional exon in the 3'utr. this is also supported by the fact that multiple attempts to extend the cdna by library screening or 3'race were not successful.

identification of transcription initiation sites
before studying the motifs and elements of the promoter region, we sought to determine the transcription initiation sites of cirk <dig> using primer extension and 5'race. when the specific reverse complementary sequence to the cirk <dig> 5'utr at positions 61– <dig> was utilized as a primer for reverse transcription, a product of approximately  <dig> bases was generated from brain mrna . specificity of cdna synthesis was determined by the absence of the band from yeast trna and df <dig> cells – a chicken embryonic fibroblast cell line which does not express detectable levels of cirk <dig> mrna . to confirm the precise transcriptional initiation sites, oligo-capped rna based 5'race  <cit>  was carried out using brain total rna as template. this method results in rna of which only transcripts with intact 5'-ends are capped by an rna-oligo. we then reverse-transcribed this rna using a specific primer r <dig> designed at positions 146– <dig> of cirk <dig> cdna. pcr was first performed with the supplied  5'-primer and the reverse primer r <dig>  subsequent nested pcr, using the supplied 5'-nested primer and a second reverse primer r <dig> designed at positions 64– <dig> of cirk <dig> cdna, produced multiple fragments. those of approximately  <dig> bp were determined to be specific products of the primer set  because they were not detected when the pcr was carried out using either the 5'-nested primer alone  or the r <dig> primer alone . the pcr fragments were cloned and multiple clones were sequenced. all of them contained  <dig> bp of 5'-capped oligo plus several lengths of cirk <dig> transcript , which occurred with similar frequencies. therefore, the actual transcribed 5'-flanking regions were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> nucleotides longer than the 5'-end of the clone originally isolated from a chick cochlea cdna library  <cit> . the confirmed initiation sites are shown in bold in fig.  <dig>  the 3'-most initiation site, located  <dig> nucleotides upstream of the 5'-end of the previously reported cirk <dig> cdna, was numbered + <dig>  our identification of multiple transcription initiation sites indicates that exon  <dig> of cirk <dig> can be  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> bases in length.

comparison of the 5'-flanking regions of cirk <dig> and mkir <dig> 
we then analyzed the motifs contained in the cirk <dig> 5'-flanking region, based on the presumption that there might be significant divergence between chicken and mammal irk1/kir <dig>  promoter regions that could account for their different gene expression patterns. the 5'-flanking region of cirk <dig>  shown in fig.  <dig>  shares no evident homology with the comparable region of the mkir <dig>  promoter  <cit> . the corresponding region of the putative human kir <dig>  promoter shows high similarity to the mkir <dig>  promoter , however, the hkir <dig>  promoter also failed to show significant homology with the cirk <dig> 5'-flanking region. while both the cirk <dig> 5'-flanking region and the mkir <dig>  promoter have high gc contents, the chick promoter is substantially more gc-rich  and contains  <dig> cpg dinucleotides as compared to  <dig> cpgs in mouse. the cirk <dig> promoter region has four consensus sp <dig> binding elements , while the mkir <dig>  promoter contains three sp <dig> sites  <cit> . consensus binding sites for several other factors were also identified. e boxes  were present at - <dig> and at - <dig>  and an inverted ccaat   <cit>  was found at - <dig>  while the mkir <dig>  promoter region contains  <dig> e boxes and one nf-y element. a striking difference from mkir <dig>  is that the cirk <dig> promoter was found to contain a putative tata box , absent in mkir <dig> , at - <dig>  overall, while gc-rich domains and motifs are present in both the chick and mouse promoter regions, the extent and number of the motifs are different between the cirk <dig> and mkir <dig>  promoters. in addition, a tata box-like sequence is present only in the chick promoter.

in vitro promoter analysis and cell-specific regulatory regions
we next sought to determine which of these avian-specific upstream elements, including the putative tata-box, might play a role in cirk <dig> transcription. first, we tested whether the 5'-flanking region up to approximately  <dig> kb contained sufficient elements to activate cirk <dig> transcription, and then we investigated the minimal promoter region by constructing a series of 5'-flanking region deletion fragments, including a portion of exon  <dig>  inserted into plasmids upstream of the luciferase reporter . promoter activities were measured following transient transfection into df <dig> or quail myoblast qm <dig> cells, which do not and do express endogenous avian irk <dig>  respectively . we hypothesized that identification of tissue specific regulatory regions of cirk <dig> could be achieved by a comparison of reporter gene expression data obtained from these two cell lines. figure 4b shows that cirk <dig> transcription was activated in many of the deletion constructs in both df <dig> and qm <dig> cells, indicating that both contain sufficient factors to activate cirk <dig> expression, whether or not they express the gene endogenously. however, promoter activities were differentially regulated in the two cell types when the relatively long 5'-flanking regions were included in the constructs upstream of the reporter luciferase gene . first, in qm <dig> cells, deletion of a domain from position - <dig> to - <dig> resulted in an approximately 60% loss of promoter activity . in addition, deletion of the segment from - <dig> to - <dig> resulted in a recovery of activity . this indicates that the region between - <dig> and - <dig> can function to repress transcription, but that this repression can be overcome by upstream elements. these effects were generally not seen in df <dig> cells, except that 3b- <dig> exhibited somewhat higher activity than did 3b- <dig>  the region between - <dig> and - <dig> showed a weak inhibitory effect on reporter expression in df <dig> cells, while it had a positive regulatory function in qm <dig> cells. finally, a dramatic loss  of promoter activity was observed upon deletion of the domain from - <dig> to - <dig> in qm <dig> cells . while this effect was substantial in qm <dig> cells, it was absent in df <dig> cells. these data indicate that the element in this region activate irk <dig> gene expression only in the myoblast cell line qm <dig> 

the relative promoter activities exhibited by 3b- <dig> and shorter constructs were similar in the two cell lines. activities decreased significantly between 3b- <dig> and 3b- <dig>  but not between 3b- <dig> and 3b- <dig>  candidate active regulatory elements in this region included three sp <dig> consensus sites arranged in tandem at - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig>  the construct 3b- <dig>  which lacks the nf-y element activated transcription as well or slightly better than 3b- <dig>  point mutation of this element in the mkir <dig>  minimal promoter resulted in a significant increase of promoter activity, suggesting a significant role for the nf-y element in mouse compared with chicken  <cit> . specific mutation of the putative tata box led to a  <dig>  % loss of activity in df <dig> cells, and an  <dig>  % loss in qm <dig> cells, but not to a complete loss of promoter activity. the construct 3b- <dig> showed no significant activity compared with the mock vector, indicating that the 5'-flanking region up to - <dig> upstream is necessary for promoter activity. taken together, two distal regions, - <dig> to - <dig> and - <dig> to - <dig>  were found to be candidate cell/tissue specific regulatory domains in the cirk <dig> promoter, while the 5' flanking region proximal to - <dig> is predicted to activate ubiquitously. the gc rich regions, including sp <dig> motifs, and the putative tata box regulate the promoter positively.

discussion
this is the first report describing a promoter analysis of an avian potassium channel. our data show that cirk <dig> and mkir <dig>  have similar genomic organizations comprised of a single intron dividing the 5'utr. in addition, in the 5'-flanking region, the cirk <dig> promoter appears to contain a unique putative tata box. our results demonstrating positive regulatory activity of the domain that includes the tattaa sequence strongly suggest that this element does indeed recruit and bind tata-binding protein  <cit> , thereby contributing significantly to gene expression. no tata boxes are found in mammalian k+ channel promoters such as those for kir <dig>   <cit> , kir <dig>   <cit> , kir <dig>   <cit> , kv <dig>   <cit> , kv <dig>   <cit>  and kv <dig>   <cit> . further studies may determine whether chick orthologous k+ channel genes share their genomic organizations with those of mammals.

it should also be emphasized that elements other than the putative tata box also participate in, although to a lesser extent, transcription initiation of cirk <dig>  just upstream of the transcription initiation site lie several binding sites for transcriptional regulation, including sp <dig> sites and an e box; these are also present in mkir <dig>  and have been shown to activate that gene's expression  <cit> . while the significant role shown for the nf-y site in mkir <dig>   <cit>  was not apparent in the case of cirk <dig> promoter activation, sp <dig> and e box-binding proteins may work cooperatively in promoter activation, as this mechanism has been reported in the study of telomerase reverse transcriptase gene regulation  <cit> . overall, the difference in transcriptional regulation of irk1/kir <dig>  between chicken and mouse is that regulation of cirk <dig> expression depends not only on the sp <dig> sites and e box, but also on the putative tata box. it is known that irk1/kir <dig>  is expressed in the sensory epithelium of the chick cochlea  <cit> , but that it is not expressed in the mature cochlea of the mouse  <cit>  or rat  <cit> . whether the putative tata box leads to the expression of cirk <dig> in the cochlea awaits further analysis.

while the results of our in vitro transcription analyses indicate that cirk <dig> transcription can be activated both in expressing qm <dig> and in non-expressing df <dig> cell lines, and therefore likely in a variety of tissues, they also showed the existence of several cell specific regulatory domains. examination of transcriptional regulation by the region - <dig> to - <dig> indicated that element in this region increase promoter activity only in the myoblast cell line qm <dig>  candidate elements within this region that might have cell-specific activity are an e box  at - <dig> and an activating component of transcription activator nf-κb  at - <dig>  <cit> . various mouse helix-loop helix transcription factors such as atonal homolog math <dig>  <cit>  and myod  <cit>  are reported to associate with e boxes and are required for tissue-specific cell type determination. the chicken math <dig> ortholog cath <dig> is expressed in the developing brain regions that express cirk <dig>  <cit> . however, our co-expression of math <dig> with the cirk <dig> promoter construct 3b- <dig> did not enhance promoter activity .

we also identified a region between - <dig> and - <dig> with weak repressor activity that exhibited different properties in the two cell lines. potential binding motifs present in this region are: a site for interferon regulatory factor- <dig> at - <dig>  an ap- <dig> site at - <dig>  a thyroid hormone beta receptor binding element  at - <dig>  another e box at - <dig>  a binding site for the potent repressor ctf/nf-i at - <dig>  <cit> , and a drosophila homeotic gene antennapedia binding motif  <cit>  at - <dig>  among these, tre has been shown to regulate a fast-activating k+ conductance in inner hair cells  <cit> , and an e box has been shown to function as a repressive element when bound by mad1/max in differentiated hl <dig> cells  <cit> .

our observation of the transcriptional activation of cirk <dig> in df <dig> cells which do not express the gene endogenously clearly suggests the existence of additional mechanisms to repress cirk <dig> in df <dig> cells. since domains acting to strongly silence cirk <dig> expression in df <dig> cells were missing in the 5'-flanking region characterized in this study, additional distant control regions may lie further upstream, downstream, or in the intronic sequences. although at this point clearly speculative, the existence of many cpg dinucleotides in cirk <dig> suggests the possibility of gene repression through dna methylation of cpg dinucleotides leading to heterochromatin condensation of the adjacent genomic locus  <cit> . tissue-specific expression of cirk <dig> might consequently be explained by a combination of regulation via the specific motifs studied here, regulation via additional domains outside this region, and the potential modification of the cirk <dig> genomic locus through dna methylation.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified multiple transcription initiation sites and several candidate regulatory elements in the chicken potassium channel gene cirk <dig>  these results provide fundamental data to further analyze cirk <dig> transcriptional mechanisms. while the use of multiple transcription initiation sites and the combinatorial participation of multiple domains in activating cirk <dig> expression are similar to those seen for mouse kir <dig> , the cirk <dig> promoter is distinct in that it exhibits a higher gc-content than does the mkir <dig>  promoter, and by the presence of a functional putative tata box that is not observed in the mkir <dig>  promoter. transcriptional control domains identified here form the foundation of an in-depth analysis of tissue-specific expression of this k+ channel as well as the species-specific expression of cirk <dig> in the chicken cochlea.
