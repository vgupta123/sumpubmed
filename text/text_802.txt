BACKGROUND
fugal pathogens pose a serious threat to immunocompromised persons. despite many antifungal agents interfering with metabolism and growth of fungal cells a limited number of compounds are being used for treatment of mycotic diseases caused by human pathogenic fungal species. over the past two decades, the number of invasive fungal infections has increased in the clinical setting. candida sp. is the fourth most common pathogen identified, and other pathogens such as cryptococcus sp., aspergillus sp., and fusarium sp., have a high morbidity and mortality. in addition, the incidence of mycoses caused by opportunistic fungi is rising  <cit> . ctbt, 7-chlorotetrazolo benzo <cit> triazine, has antifungal activity and enhances the efficacy of other antifungals with different targets such as cycloheximide, fluconazole or 5-fluorocytosine  <cit> . the molecular mechanism of ctbt action has not yet been resolved.

currently used antifungals belong to three major classes of agents: azoles, polyenes, and echinocandines  <cit> . these compounds target ergosterol biosynthesis, membrane functions and cell wall biosynthesis. additionally, other currently applied compounds are the pyrimidine, 5-fluorocytosine , which acts by inhibiting rna and dna synthesis  <cit>  and ciclopiroxolamine which seems to induce oxidative stress and iron deprivation  <cit> . the intrinsic resistance of human fungal pathogens to these substances is different. echinocandins are effective in candida prevention and offer a greater spectrum of activity across the various candida species, including also c. krusei and c. glabrata, which are not reliably covered by azoles e.g. fluconazole  <cit> .

fungal drug resistance mechanisms involve decreased drug uptake, increased drug export, overexpression or structural modification of the drug target protein  <cit> . reversal of antifungal drug effectiveness in yeast cells mediated by efflux has been reported for a variety of substances targeting different molecular processes. these are for example the immunosuppressive agents fk <dig> and cyclosporine  <cit> . to overcome drug resistance of human fungal pathogens, new antifungals with novel cellular targets  <cit>  and multidrug resistance reversal agents rendering drug resistant strains sensitive to commercially used antifungals are being developed  <cit>  but have not surfaced as yet. studies evaluating combinations of antifungals have shown synergistic and additive activity. however, caution is required, because some antifungal combinations have demonstrated antagonistic activity. controlled clinical trials are still necessary to explore the various efficacious antifungal combinations  <cit> . since the common antifungals are mainly targeting membrane and cell wall components, efficient combination therapy might be reached by involving substances with an alternative mode of action.

the site and mode of ctbt action have not yet been resolved. ctbt displayed a weak antifungal activity which was unaffected by deletion of the pdr <dig> and pdr <dig> genes encoding the main transcription activators involved in the control of multidrug resistance in saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> . yeast cells grown in its presence had altered sterol composition and were more sensitive to this compound in the yap1Δ genetic background  <cit> . here we report insights gained for the mode of ctbt action by systematic identification of yeast genes required for resistance to ctbt in combination with transcriptome analysis. we will show that ctbt causes an unexpected dramatic response to oxidative stress including damage to mitochondria and genomic dna. these results provide a model for ctbt action and indicate that its synergic effect with commonly used antifungal drugs is due to the combination of oxidative and other stresses.

RESULTS
ctbt action depends on molecular oxygen and is connected by mitochondrial functions
ctbt has been shown to display cytotoxic activity and the ability to enhance the activity of several antifungal agents at sub-inhibitory concentrations  <cit> . in disk diffusion assay on ypd medium using the s. cerevisiae by <dig> wild type and its rho- mutant strains ctbt induced the formation of clear growth inhibition zones that were surrounded by outer inhibition zones corresponding to reduced yeast growth . growth inhibition zones of respiring cells growing on ypge medium containing glycerol plus ethanol were significantly larger compared to those with fermenting cells on ypd. this suggested that ctbt disrupted mitochondrial functions . essentially the same results were obtained with the by <dig> and fy1678-28c wild type strains . on the other hand, s. cerevisiae yeast cells grown anaerobically were found to be insensitive to ctbt. as expected for qualitative anaerobicity of our experimental setup, both strains failed to grow anaerobically without ergosterol and unsaturated fatty acids. no inhibition zones were observed when cells of the by <dig> and by <dig> wild type strains were grown in the absence of molecular oxygen on ypd medium supplemented with ergosterol and unsaturated fatty acids . these results clearly indicate that mitochondrial functions and molecular oxygen are involved in the ctbt susceptibility in yeast cells.

identification of yeast deletion mutants with increased ctbt susceptibility
to gain more insight into ctbt action we systematically identified mutants with altered sensitivity. we screened the s. cerevisiae haploid deletion mutant collection for altered growth in the presence of ctbt. the wild type strain by <dig> from which the euroscarf collection has been derived was unable to grow on ypd medium supplemented with  <dig> μg/ml of ctbt. therefore, the hypersensitive mutant strains were identified on ypd media containing  <dig> and  <dig> μg/ml of ctbt. using pin replicator, cells of each mutant strain grown in ypd medium containing g <dig> sulphate were replicated as quadruplets to ctbt containing medium and to ypd control plate. after  <dig> days of growth the mutant strains sensitive to  <dig> or  <dig> μg/ml of ctbt were identified, collected and their sensitivity to ctbt confirmed in independent assays. this screen of the  <dig> haploid gene deletion mutants was carried out once and resulted in the isolation of  <dig> ctbt hypersensitive mutant strains .

significantly, some molecular complexes or biochemical pathways were represented by more than one mutant . in order to assign cellular functions contributing to ctbt tolerance we searched for enriched gene ontology  categories according to the sgd go-termfinder. the most prominent go terms associated to the genes required for ctbt tolerance were functions related to mitochondria, transcription, dna repair, and stress response .

the largest group of strains hypersensitive to ctbt contained deletions in genes for mitochondrial biogenesis and functions, including dna replication , mrna processing , protein synthesis and processing , respiration , atp synthesis , fe/s protein biosynthesis , superoxide dismutation  and others.

in the second largest group were mutants in genes involved in gene expression thus hinting at an acute transcriptional response to ctbt. identified genes are involved in chromatin remodeling , transcription  or encode transcription factors involved in oxidative stress response  and lipid biosynthesis .

we identified at least  <dig> ctbt sensitive strains containing deletion in dna repair genes, including those involved in homologous recombination and repair , post replication repair , double strand break repair , excision repair  and others. importantly, deletion of genes encoding functions in lipid metabolism also impaired ctbt tolerance. these are involved in ergosterol , fatty acid  and phospholipid biosynthesis . along with superoxide dismutase encoding genes, sod <dig> and sod <dig>  which have a primary role in superoxide radical detoxification, other genes involved in oxidative stress response were also identified. the ccs <dig> gene encodes the specific copper chaperone delivering the copper to sod <dig>  the ctr <dig> gene is coding for a high affinity copper transporter of the plasma membrane. the transcription factors yap <dig>  yap <dig> and skn <dig> are involved in transcriptional regulation of oxidative stress response genes including sod <dig>  sod <dig> and others. additional functions required for ctbt tolerance involve vacuolar metabolism, protein sorting, amino acid metabolisms and others . importantly, many genes with ctbt defense functions overlap with those involved in menadion, hydrogen peroxide and arsenic stress tolerance  <cit> .

the results of phenotypic profiling and the oxygen dependence of ctbt action, led us to the suggestion that ctbt induces reactive oxygen species in yeast cells.

transcriptional profile analysis of ctbt treated yeast cells
profiles of transcriptional responses can be used to identify cellular defense processes. we therefore investigated the immediate response of wild type by <dig> cells treated with ctbt. we used a dose 1/3rd of the minimal inhibitory concentration   <dig> μg/ml in a time curse of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> min in liquid medium. expression data were collected from duplicate arrays. we identified  <dig> genes induced in at least one time point by more than  <dig> fold and  <dig> genes repressed more than  <dig> fold . repressed genes comprised many genes with functions in protein biosynthesis . this has been observed previously in transcript profiles from cells treated with various other compounds or exposed to stressful conditions  <cit>  and correlates frequently with repression of sfp <dig> function  <cit> . most ribosomal protein genes were repressed to about half of the level of exponentially growing cells.

the induction kinetics had an early and a delayed transcriptional wave. notably, the genes with eminent antioxidant functions were induced most rapidly. many induced genes were linked to mitochondrial functions and oxidative stress response . we further predicted the possible transcription factors involved. t-profiler based analysis revealed that among the induced genes some transcription factor binding sites were highly enriched  <cit> . these were the general stress transcription factors msn <dig> and msn <dig>  but more prominently the oxidative stress response factors yap <dig>  skn <dig>  yap <dig>  and cin5/yap <dig> . especially many yap <dig> and skn <dig> targeted genes were evident in the immediate early response genes. moreover, a number of cin5/yap <dig> target genes were found to establish a second non-overlapping oxidative stress regulon . among the ctbt repressed genes we noticed a number of genes involved in the ergosterol biosynthesis  and the target of azoles antifungals, the enzyme lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase erg11p. to demonstrate a general effect on these genes we show the expression profiles of the genes associated to the go-term lipid biosynthesis .

next we analyzed the connection between transcript and phenotype profiles . generally, phenotypic display data do not have large overlaps with transcript profile data. this is due to the fact that pathways activate many target genes in parallel with sometime redundant functions. however, in some cases the overlap is informative since it points to exceptionally important nodes of stress resistance  <cit> . here we found a small number of genes both required for tolerance and significantly induced. they encode proteins required for several different mitochondrial functions: isa <dig>  a protein required for maturation of mitochondrial and cytosolic fe/s proteins, atp <dig>  the alpha subunit of the h+atpase, sod <dig> the cytosolic superoxide dismutase, ccs <dig> the copper chaperone for sod1p and sod <dig>  the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase. this overlap points to an essential response to ctbt originating from or localized to mitochondria. furthermore, the transcription factors srb <dig>  yap <dig> and yap <dig> are induced also at the level of transcription . comparison of  <dig> genes required for resistance to ctbt, and  <dig> required for hydrogen peroxide, menadione, mefloquine, and ibuprophen reistance  <cit>  showed a significant overlap . we could not detect a significant bias of genes required for resistance to hydrogen peroxide, menadione, mefloquine, and ibuprophen in our dataset, indicating induction of general oxidative stress by ctbt.

yap <dig> accumulates rapidly in the nucleus in cells exposed to oxidative stress  <cit> . we followed the intracellular distribution of yap1-gfp construct and found a similar rapid accumulation of yap <dig> in both ctbt and hydrogen peroxide stressed cells . taken together the transcript profiling data support the phenotypic display by pointing to an immediate oxidative stress response and furthermore to an important protective function of superoxide scavenging and mitochondrial activity.

mitochondrial superoxide production and petite mutant formation in ctbt treated yeast cells
s. cerevisiae mutant strains deleted in the sod <dig> or sod <dig> genes were found to be the most sensitive to ctbt. the minimal inhibitory concentrations of ctbt determined by broth dilution method for the sod1Δ and sod2Δ mutants  were 10-times reduced compared to the wild type strain. thus, we suspected that ctbt induces superoxide formation. to determine this directly, mitosox red was used to assess superoxide radical production in live cells. this dye is selectively targeted to the mitochondria where it is selectively oxidized by superoxide and exhibits red fluorescence upon binding to nucleic acids  <cit> . as shown in figure 5a, a large fraction of wild type cells grown for  <dig> h in ypgal medium in the presence of sub-inhibitory concentrations of ctbt accumulated the dye and fluoresced intensively red, compared with control cells grown in the absence of ctbt. analysis of individual cells under a fluorescence microscope revealed cells with mitochondrial fluorescence. in addition, a small fraction of cells showed red brilliant fluorescence, which may represent severely damaged or dead cells  <cit>  . a high percentage of cells exhibiting mitochondrial fluorescence was also observed in the population of the sod2Δ mutant strain treated with a 10-times lower concentration of ctbt. in the genetic background of the s. cerevisiae eg <dig> strain the sod1Δ mutant cells were significantly more sensitive to ctbt compared with the sod2Δ cells. these results demonstrate that ctbt induces an increased production of superoxide that may disturb many cellular functions by damaging nucleic acids, oxidizing proteins and causing lipid peroxidation. in fact, when the sod2Δ mutant cells were grown for  <dig> h in ypd medium containing a sub-inhibitory concentration of ctbt the respiration deficient petite mutants were induced in high frequency indicating the damage to mtdna induced by ctbt . both the ctbt treatment and the absence of sod <dig> or sod <dig> result in increased ros formation  <cit> . it was also possible that ctbt mediated inactivation of sod1p and/or sod2p might contribute partly to the observed ros formation. to assess the role of superoxide dismutases, the isogenic series of the sod1Δ, sod2Δ and sod1Δ sod2Δ mutant strains derived from the s. cerevisiae eg <dig> wild type strain were used in zone inhibition assay with ctbt  on ypd. we observed that sensitivity of the sod1Δ sod2Δ double mutant cells was slightly higher compared to the sod1Δ mutant . we conclude that enhanced ros production by ctbt treatment is counteracted by both superoxide dismutases.

the results are means of two experiments.

theoretical treatment of ctbt activity
in order to get more insight into the mechanism of ctbt induced superoxide generation we used the standard computational protocol to perform quantum chemical calculations of  <dig> tetrazolo- and triazolobenzotriazines described previously  <cit> . to compare the important structural parameters and their influence on the biological activity, the unsubstituted  <cit>  triazolo benzo <cit> triazine  was added to the original series. four parameters that could be related to biological activity of compounds were chosen. logp models the transport of molecules in biological systems, μ is the dipole moment of isolated molecule in debye units, homo  and lumo  stand for energy of frontier orbitals in ev units.

as shown in figure  <dig>  ctbt is predicted to yield the lowest values of dipole moment, homo orbital energy and mainly very low value of lumo orbital energy compared with another compounds under study. the value of lumo energy appears to be the most important calculated parameter for possible explanation of ctbt activity related to its antifungal effect expressed as the diameter of the growth inhibition zone . if one electron reduction would be assumed as the first step in ctbt mediated superoxide production, the low value of lumo energy makes the electron transfer into lumo of ctbt leading to ctbt radical easily possible.

in the chemical structure of studied molecules there are two structural characteristics that decrease significantly the lumo-energy i.e. chlorine atom and tetrazolo ring that both are incorporated into ctbt. consequently, ctbt appears as the main candidate for redox cycling and superoxide generation among the studied molecules. these calculations and the genetic data show that ctbt has a capacity to generate superoxide radicals with reducing equivalents possible derived from the respiratory chain.

discussion
in this study we show that ctbt, a compound enhancing the antifungal activity of several drugs  <cit> , generates superoxide and other reactive oxygen species  and induces massive oxidative stress in yeast cells which enhances the antifungal activity of several unrelated drugs.

five lines of evidence suggest that ctbt produces oxidative stress via generation of superoxide. first, ctbt toxicity required molecular oxygen. second, it has predicted molecular properties of a molecule capable of redox cycling. third, we detected oxidative stress using the two in vivo reporters mitosox red and yap1-gfp. fourth, genetic evidence was provided by the isolation of characteristic mutants with defects in oxidative stress scavenging functions. fifth, transcription profiling showed activation of regulons associated with oxidative stress response. ctbt activity was strictly dependent on the presence of molecular oxygen because no inhibition of growth by this drug was observed under strictly anaerobic conditions.

antifungal activity of ctbt was higher on media containing glycerol plus ethanol instead of glucose indicating that developed functional mitochondria might be involved in drug action. this implies that apart from superoxide anion radical  and ros generation ctbt does not have other direct cytotoxic effects. ros affect many cellular functions by damaging nucleic acids, oxidizing proteins and causing lipid peroxidation  <cit> . dismutation of superoxide into hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen is catalyzed by two superoxide dismutases: the cu, zn-depending sod1p localized in the cytosol and the mitochondrial intermembrane space and the mn-depending sod2p which is localized in the mitochondrial matrix  <cit> . among the gene deletion strains selected for increased ctbt sensitivity , the sod1Δ and sod2Δ mutant strains were found to be the most sensitive. additionally, the mutants deleted for sod <dig> and ccs <dig>  a copper chaperone essential for sod1p maturation, had a similar phenotype. ctbt could act as an inhibitor of sods. since the sod1Δsod2Δ double mutant cells were also sensitive to ctbt the sod1p and sod2p superoxide dismutases cannot be the primary targets of ctbt action. therefore, ctbt is a producer of superoxide in presence of oxygen.

ctbt could either directly be a reducing agent or, alternatively, as a cofactor in the context of an enzyme. our genetic data suggest that ctbt is not acting via a single enzyme because such deletion mutants would be resistant to ctbt and could be easily isolated by genetic means. in fact, in similar screen we were unable to find deletion mutants resistant to ctbt used at the concentration of  <dig> μg/ml. however, the possibility of a redundant enzymatic activity exists plus the requirement of reducing equivalents. in intact cells, the superoxide anion radical  is the precursor of most ros and is generated under specific bioenergetic conditions at several sites within the mitochondrial electron-transport system. most of superoxide is converted to h2o <dig> and oxygen inside and outside the mitochondrial matrix by superoxide dismutases  <cit> . non-mitochondrial sources of ros involve cytochrome b <dig> reductase, nadph oxidases, lipoxygenases, monoamine oxidases, xanthine oxidase and others  <cit> . in s. cerevisiae, the main sites of mitochondrial superoxide formation are one nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductase located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and facing the matrix  <cit> , two nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductases facing the mitochondrial intermembrane space and the ubiquinol:cytochrome c reductase  <cit> . this is in line with our scheme proposing ctbt induced superoxide generation in mitochondria . furthermore, paraquat, the herbicide generating superoxide by redox cycling, is principally reduced by mitochondrial nadh dehydrogenases  <cit> .

most identified genes required for increased ctbt susceptibility were found to be involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and function, dna repair, gene expression, lipid metabolism and stress response . many of them are known to be involved in defense processes protecting yeast cells against oxidative stress  <cit>  and have been previously identified in genome-wide analyzes of yeast deletion mutant strains sensitive to oxidative stress induced by a superoxide generator menadione, hydrogen peroxide, organic peroxides  <cit> , arsenite and cadmium  <cit> .

remarkable is a high frequency of ctbt hypersensitive deletion mutants with affected mitochondrial functions. a requirement of energy for the repair of oxidatively damaged molecules has previously been proposed to explain why petite mutants are more sensitive to oxidative stress than wild type strains  <cit> . on the other hand one cannot rule out a higher permeability of mitochondrial membranes for ctbt, superoxide or other ros generated in dysfunctional mitochondria. the increased damage to mutant mitochondria caused by ros may also reduce the mitochondrial membrane potential under critical level resulting in the arrest of mitochondrial biogenesis required for growth of eukaryotic cells  <cit> .

other significant pathways involved in ctbt susceptibility were also identified by the presence of several genes involved in the same pathway or encoding the subunits of the particular cellular complexes. this concerns genes involved in the rad <dig> and rad <dig> epistasis groups of dna repair, paf <dig> complex of rna polymerase ii , protein sorting to vacuole , vacuolar atpase , n-terminal acetyltransferases  acetylating many proteins involved in cell cycle, heat shock resistance, mating, sporulation and telomere silencing as well as genes involved in ergosterol metabolism  and tryptophan biosynthesis . along with tryptophan, interruption of the synthesis of cystein, isoleucin and proline also enhanced the ctbt toxicity. the sensitivity displayed by corresponding mutant strains is apparently not the result of the absence of the amino acids because ctbt was toxic on ypd plates that contain all necessary amino acids. it is possible that the accumulation of intermediates enhances the effect of ctbt.

the overlay of expression data with phenotypic data pointed mainly to superoxide dismutase activity  and second to the activation of transcription factors yap <dig>  cin5/yap <dig>  and yap <dig>  yap1p is a transcription activator involved in the control of multidrug resistance and oxidative stress response  <cit> . reactive oxygen species  generated both from endogenous and exogenous sources induce accumulation of yap1p in the nucleus resulting in enhanced transcription of many genes involved in removing or detoxifying ros. cin5/yap <dig> is activated by oxidative stress  <cit>  like yap <dig>  the contribution of yap <dig> to transcription is less understood. yap <dig> is involved in transcriptional activation of the sod <dig>  sod <dig> and ccs <dig> genes . however, we found no transcriptional induction of dna damage specific genes and possibly because this stress type does not surface within the observed time frame. these findings suggest a highly focused primary effect of ctbt on oxidative stress and delayed effects on other pathways.

ctbt enhances activity of several drugs  <cit> . this synergy becomes perhaps clearer when considering the production of superoxide and other ros. our phenotypic screen showed an enhanced sensitivity of mutants in the rad <dig> and rad <dig> epistasis groups of dna repair. 5-fluorocytosine is a drug which enters nucleotide metabolism and damages the cells by interfering with dntp and mrna synthesis. ctbt could act at two levels. oxidative damage might cause dna damage and at the same time hamper deoxynucleotide synthesis requiring glutathione or thioredoxin for production via ribonucleotide reductase. azoles and terbinafin both target ergosterol synthesis. interestingly, ctbt reduces transcription of most genes for the enzymes of the pathway. finally, ctbt might exacerbate cycloheximide inhibition on translation by reduction of synthesis of ribosomal protein genes. oxidative stress causes inactivation of the target of rapamycin complex  <dig>  and thus inactivation of the sfp <dig>  one major activator of transcription of ribosomal protein genes. an interaction with the popular echinocandines remains to be shown. up to now the combination of antifungals has been tried in vitro in many different combinations. the application of combinations may reduce costs, and importantly shift the effect of the drug towards fungicidal activity . apart from combinations of classical antifungals , unusual combinations lead to unexpected results as for example in the case of azoles plus calcineurin inhibitors  <cit>  or with membrane active compounds  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
ctbt, apart from its weak antifungal activity, is able to strongly inhibit the proliferation of multidrug resistant yeast cells in combination with subinhibitory concentrations of other antifungals. its mode of action depending on the molecular oxygen has been resolved using the combination of two genome-wide approaches including the screening of yeast deletion library for ctbt hypersensitivity mutants and transcriptome analysis of yeast cells exposed to this drug. we found that ctbt induces an increased production of superoxide and oxidative stress associated with damage to mitochondria and genomic dna. yeast cells deleted in nonessential genes encoding proteins involved mainly in mitochondrial function, dna repair, transcription and oxidative stress response are hypersensitive to ctbt. ctbt rapidly induces transcription of oxidant and stress response defense genes activated mainly by yap <dig> and yap4/cin <dig> transcription factors.

the exact molecular mechanism of ctbt action, associated with superoxide generation in mitochondria, is not known so far. it does not require a complete and functional respiratory chain as demonstrated by ctbt sensitivity of rho- mutant cells. theoretical treatment of ctbt activity revealed that this compound might be amenable to one electron reduction. electrons donated from mitochondrial nadh dehydrogenases or cytochrome bc <dig> complex can lead to ctbt anion radical formation that can be re-oxidized by molecular oxygen generating superoxide probable on the both sides of the inner mitochondrial membrane . our combined genome wide approaches show the power of yeast genetics and transcript profiling to define mode of functioning of bioactive substances.
