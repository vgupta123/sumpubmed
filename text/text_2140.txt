BACKGROUND
the eggplant , also known as aubergine or brinjal, belongs to the solanaceae, but unlike most of the solanaceous crop species, it is endemic to the old, not the new world. its progenitor is presumed to have been the african species s. incanum  <cit> , but its centre of domestication and genetic diversity lies in the indo-burma region, where it has been grown for at least  <dig>  years  <cit> . despite its economic and nutritional importance, its genome has been little studied, in contrast to those of the other cultivated solanaceous crops tomato, potato and pepper, in which high density genetic linkage maps have been established  <cit> . the literature contains only a few reports describing rapd  <cit> , aflp  <cit>  and ssr  <cit>  genotyping, a genetic map constructed with aflp and rapd markers  <cit>  and a comparative genetic map, based on tomato sequences  <cit> .

microsatellites  are short tandem repeats of simple  motifs, and their value for genetic analysis lies in their multi-allelism, codominant inheritance, relative abundance, genome coverage and suitability for high-throughput pcr-based platforms  <cit> . it was long assumed that ssrs were primarily associated with non-coding dna, but it has now become clear that they are also abundant in the single and low-copy fraction of the genome  <cit> . these latter ssrs are commonly referred to as "genic ssrs" or "est-ssrs" and are present in  <dig> to 5% of the expressed plant dna sequence deposited in public databases. with the increasing volume of publicly available unigene and cdna sequences emerging from large-scale est sequencing projects, the conventional need to generate enriched genomic libraries and to perform the necessary sequencing can now be largely bypassed  <cit> . genic ssrs tend to be more readily transferable between  species or genera than genomic ones, since coding sequence is better conserved than non-coding sequence; however, they do tend to be less informative than conventional ssrs, particularly in the context of related genotypes  <cit> . on the other hand, they provide a powerful means to link the genetic maps of related species, and since many of them are located within genes of known or at least putative function, any allelic variation present can be exploited to generate perfect markers  <cit> .

we present here our progress in the development and preliminary characterization of a set of eggplant ssr markers, derived from public database sequence, along with an evaluation of their experimental and in silico transferability among other solanaceous species.

RESULTS
ssr motif frequency and distribution
at the time surveyed, the solanaceae genomics network database  contained  <dig>  eggplant ests, ordered into  <dig>  unigenes . an additional  <dig> sequences were retrieved from the embl sequence database . the non-redundant sequence pool contained  <dig>  sequences representing  <dig>  bp of genomic sequence. within these,  <dig> contained one or more ssr . one sequence contained three ssrs, while ten ssrs were of the compound type . the mean separation between two ssrs was ~ <dig>  kb, equivalent to one ssr per  <dig> sequences. this distance is somewhat greater than that estimated for several monocotyledenous  <cit>  and dicotyledenous  <cit>  species, perhaps because of the greater stringency of the criteria and the lesser size of the sequence dataset.

the properties of the  <dig> ssr loci identified are summarised in table  <dig>  classified on the basis of repeat motif and the number of repeat units. trinucleotides were the most frequent , followed by mono-  and dinucleotides . tetra- and hexanucleotides were rare. although trinucleotide motifs are less frequent in genomic libraries, they represent the most common class in expressed sequence  <cit> , since variation in repeat number does not normally affect downstream peptide sequence, unlike mono-, di-, or tetra-nucleotide motifs, which generate frameshift mutations and therefore are more likely to be selected against  <cit> . all ten possible trinucleotide motifs were recovered, with aag/ctt the most frequent , as has been seen in other solanaceae species  <cit>  and more generally within plant sequence databases  <cit> . ccg/cgg and agg/cct are the most common monocotyledonous est-ssr motifs  <cit>  and were under-represented in dicotyledonous species as well as in the present dataset. kantety et al.  <cit>  have observed that ag/ct predominates among the dinucleotide motifs, presumably reflecting the high frequency of ala  and leu   in polypeptides  <cit> . these motifs represented  <dig> % of the eggplant dinucleotide ssrs. the second most abundant motif  was at/at, which is also well represented among plant est sequences  <cit> . most of the mononucleotide repeats  were a/t.

the total length of the  <dig> microsatellite containing sequence reached the  <dig>  bp. of this  <dig>  bp represented untranslated  â€“ and  <dig>  bp represented protein-coding regions. ssrs were non-randomly distributed among coding regions and utrs. all of the mononucleotide and majority of the dinucleotide repeats  were associated with utrs. mononucleotide repeats were evenly distributed among 5' and 3' utrs while dimeric ones preferentially associated with 5'utrs. triplet repeats were significantly over-represented in coding region  and among non-coding regions showed more than  <dig> folds greater frequency in 5'utrs. such dominance of trimeric over other ssrs in coding regions can be explained by non-perturbation of the reading frame.

ssr assays and their informativeness
of the  <dig> sequences containing one or more ssr,  <dig>  were amenable to primer design. the markers targeted by eems <dig> to eems <dig> comprised  <dig> mono-, five di-,  <dig> tri- and two hexanucleotide simple repeats, together with two di- and two trinucleotide compound loci. the remaining sequences contained either too little flanking sequence, or the sequences themselves were refractory for primer design. thus, primers amplifying non-redundant loci were designed from about  <dig> % of the initial number of database sequences, a success rate comparable to that experienced in other species  <cit> . amplicons were generated from genomic dna template from  <dig>  of the  <dig> loci. failure to amplify can be due to a variety of causes, including the positioning of primers across a splicing site, or to a chimeric origin of the cdna clones. in all,  <dig>  of the  <dig> assays were informative across the whole genotype panel , but only  <dig>  were informative among the sample of cultivated eggplant. the majority of the trinucleotide-containing ssrs were informative between species, but few generated any polymorphism among the cultivated set, while the dinucleotide ssrs identified both inter- and intra-specific polymorphism. similar results have been reported for eggplant by nunome et al.  <cit>  who described that 57% of trinucleotide ssrs were informative at inter-, but only 14% at intraspecific level, while, for the dinucleotide ssrs, the respective frequencies were 78% and 70%. the repeat type, primer sequence and pic  of the successful markers are given in table  <dig> 

1bl: breeding line; cv: cultivated variety; rt: rootstock.

 <dig> na1: number of alleles detected among the  <dig> cultivated types, na2: number of alleles detected among the full  <dig> genotype set;  <dig> picm: calculated among the  <dig> cultivated types, pics: calculated among the full  <dig> genotype set; 3cds: coding sequence

generally, amplicon size was in agreement with expectation, although eems  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> all amplified a product at least  <dig> bp larger than expected, presumably because the amplicon included an intron. eems <dig> produced an amplicon of smaller than expected length, perhaps because of the presence of a deletion within the genomic sequence, poor priming specificity amplifying a non-target member of a gene family, or because of minor sequence variation between the amplified copy and the consensus sequence  <cit> . a total of  <dig> alleles was amplified from the full genotype panel, with the number of alleles per locus varying between  <dig> and  <dig>  . the greatest variation in amplicon size  was shown by eems <dig>  both the pic among the  <dig> cultivated types  and among the full  <dig> genotype set  were calculated. picm ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  , while pics varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . the highest and lowest picm were produced by, respectively, eems <dig> and eems <dig>  while eems <dig> had the highest, and eems <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> shared the lowest pics. the correlation coefficient between picm and ssr length was  <dig>  , in agreement with the general trend for long ssrs to be more informative than shorter ones  <cit> . trinucleotide motif ssrs were less informative than the dinucleotide types . the former are typically associated with a low level of variability  <cit> . the overall level of intraspecific polymorphism uncovered  is typical  <cit> , and compares poorly with the rate achievable by genomic ssr assays  <cit> .

genetic diversity revealed by ssr markers
thiel et al  <cit>  have stressed the limitations surrounding the application of ssr markers for diversity studies, emphasising the possibility of homoplasy , and have pointed out that allele size differences can also be generated by indel events, as well as by variation in the ssr repeat number. however, the genetic relationships between the accessions of the full genotype panel as displayed by genetic similarity at the ssr level were in good agreement with prior taxonomic classification based on both genomic  <cit>  and plastidial markers  <cit> . thus the cultivated eggplants clustered with an average genetic similarity of 82% . three pairs of cultivars  and 'mirabelle', 'dr2' and 'lunga violetta napoletana' were identical to one another. the cluster closest to the cultivated group contained both s. viarum and s. sodomaeum, with a mean genetic differentiation of ~50% from the cultivated germplasm. the s. torvum accession was more distant . the third cluster contained the remaining species s. sisymbrifolium, aethiopicum and integrifolium which shared a mean genetic similarity of 56%.

the eems primers were also applied to amplify template from potato, tomato and pepper, which all belong to the solanaceae. to minimise non-specific amplification, the same stringency level for pcr was applied as with eggplant template. about 54%  generated a detectable amplicon from at least one of the three species; ten of  <dig> amplified all three templates, seven amplified potato and tomato but not pepper dna, two tomato and pepper but not potato, and one each amplified only from potato and tomato.

the principal co-ordinate analysis  analysis illustrates the genetic relationships between the members of the genotype panel . the first three principal co-ordinates accounted for ~54% of the overall genetic variation, with each in turn contributing  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %. the first co-ordinate distinguished the cultivated forms from the allied genotypes, while the second allowed the separation of each related eggplant genotypes.

blast analyses
of the  <dig> functional ssr markers, all but eems <dig> were developed from anonymous eggplant unigene sequences,  <dig> of which share significant homology to arabidopsis thaliana proteins of unknown function. eems <dig> lies within a chloroplast phosphate transporter gene . using the source eggplant sequences as a blastn query ,  <dig>  of the markers identified highly conserved orthologs, with a frequency negatively correlated with phylogenetic distance from eggplant  <cit> . eems <dig>  eems <dig>  eems <dig>  eems <dig>  and eems <dig> had homologous counterparts with known function. sequences containing homologous microsatellite motifs in conserved positions were found in  <dig> potato,  <dig> tomato and  <dig> pepper orthologs . contrasting results are reported in literature on the transferability of microsatellite markers across members of the solanaceae  <cit> . the high level of transferability between the seven solanum spp. mirrors the experience in other groups of plants  <cit> ; furthermore we detect a low level of intraspecific polymorphism which seems to confirm the conclusion that est-ssrs are highly conserved across species  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in eggplant, as in pepper and tomato  <cit> , the level of intraspecific dna marker polymorphism is rather limited. nunome et al  <cit>  constructed a genetic map in eggplant based on rapd and aflp markers, but only  <dig> % of the rapd primers were informative, and even the aflp primer combinations were only able to deliver a mean of  <dig>  polymorphisms each. we have shown that an in silico analysis of the albeit limited quantity of publicly available eggplant dna sequence has enabled the development of a set of functional ssr markers. because these sequences are derived from the expressed portion of the genome, they are relevant for assaying functional diversity in populations or germplasm collections. most of the eems ssrs are readily transferable to related species, and so can be exploited as anchor markers for comparative mapping and evolutionary studies.
