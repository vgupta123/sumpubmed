BACKGROUND
much like horizontal gene transfer , the frequency, mechanisms and evolutionary impact of the horizontal transfer of transposable elements  have been well characterized in prokaryotes  <cit> . in eukaryotes, the number of fully sequenced genomes is now sufficient to reveal that htt has also had a significant impact on the evolution of genomes in this group, but many aspects of the phenomenon remain largely mysterious  <cit> . among metazoans, and in particular vertebrates, htt can be examined on a geological timescale because these taxa are characterized by large, slow-evolving genomes in which vast numbers of transposable elements  can persist for many millions of years. in a series of recent studies, we and others reported numerous cases of class ii tes  transferred horizontally among vertebrate and invertebrate species, between multiple continents, over a period stretching from ~ <dig> to ~ <dig> my ago  <cit> . these htt events are notable because they are geographically widespread, implicate several transposon families, and affect a wide range of tetrapods, as well as a blood-sucking parasitic insect  as a possible vector  <cit> . one of the transposon families, oposcharlie <dig> , achieved a particularly high level of promiscuity, as it was found to have infiltrated the genomes of  <dig> deeply diverged species on both old and new world continents at the time of transfer.

RESULTS
sequence homology-based searches  using the oc1_et consensus sequence as a query  yielded many significant hits in the genome of the tasmanian devil . majority-rule consensus sequences were reconstructed for an autonomous element  encoding a 602-amino acid transposase and for a major family of non-autonomous elements  based on an alignment of  <dig> representative copies of each type . we called this autonomous element family oc1_das to reflect the fact that, in addition to the tasmanian devil, it is present in several other members of the family dasyuridae . in addition, non-autonomous partners of oc1_das are called oc1_das_na. they form a high copy number, homogenous family of non-autonomous elements , which likely result from amplification of an internally-deleted autonomous copy , a process typical of class ii transposons  <cit> . further sequence mining using blastn and repeatmasker  <cit>  revealed that the tasmanian devil’s genome contains  <dig>  copies  of oc1_das; of these,  <dig> are full length or slightly truncated autonomous elements and the rest correspond to short non-autonomous elements. two studies recently produced whole genome sequence  data for several tasmanian devil individuals  <cit> . the results presented here are based on analyses of the wgs produced by miller et al.  <cit>  only, but analyses  carried out on the other wgs data  <cit>  yield very similar numbers.

an alignment of the oc1_das autonomous consensus sequence with those reconstructed previously for vertebrate and invertebrate taxa known to harbor oc <dig>  <cit>  revealed a very high level of nucleotide identity across the entire length of the elements . phylogenetic analyses of  <dig> randomly-selected copies of oc1_das yielded a star topology and a lack of subfamily structure, indicating that oc1_das amplified through a single major burst of transposition, followed by the accumulation of private mutations in its copies. this pattern is consistent with a scenario of neutral evolution after insertion in the genome . in further support for the neutral evolution of oc1_das transposase sequences, we found that dn/ds values calculated between the consensus oc1_das and each of the  <dig> copies examined were all above  <dig>  . in addition, a codon-based z-test revealed no evidence of purifying selection acting on oc1_das transposase genes after their insertion in the tasmanian devil genome . thus, as concluded in previous studies  <cit> , the level of sequence conservation between oc1_das and oc <dig> elements previously identified in other species is incompatible with vertical inheritance from the most recent common ancestor  between oc1_das and oc1_md from the opposum  is significantly higher  than that of rag <dig>  a gene known to evolve under strong functional constraint in vertebrates . thus, the presence of oc <dig> in the tasmanian devil’s genome is best explained by the horizontal transfer of this element into this lineage. this discovery brings the total number of animal lineages independently infiltrated by oc <dig> to twelve.

next, we endeavored to estimate the age of invasion of tasmanian devils by oc <dig> using two independent approaches. first, we estimated the timing of genomic amplification of oc1_das, because a burst of transposition is most likely to occur quickly after htt and, indeed, may be necessary for the element to successfully colonize a species  <cit> . to calculate this, we divided the average percent divergence between the consensus sequences and all copies of the te in the genome  by an estimate of the neutral rate of nucleotide substitution . we are not aware of any estimate of the neutral rate of substitution for the dasyuridae, and therefore used the rate we previously estimated based on genomic alignments of opossum and wallaby ancestral repeats . this yielded an approximate age estimate of  <dig> my ago  for the activity peak of oc1_das, which falls within the range of the htt events previously reported for this transposon . as an independent assessment of the age of the oc1_das invasion, we conducted a pcr screen of oc <dig> in several marsupial species with different divergence times from the tasmanian devil. for this, we used a pair of internal oc1_das primers designed from the consensus sequence to look for presence/absence of the element, as well as primer pairs flanking five individual insertions in the tasmanian devil to look for presence/absence of the element at orthologous genomic positions in the other species. the results of this screen indicate that oc1_das is undetectable in the tammar wallaby  and bandicoot  genomes . the absence of oc1_das in wallaby was confirmed computationally by a blastn search of its draft whole genome sequence  <cit> . our pcr screen detected oc1_das in the dunnart , but not at any of the three orthologous loci occupied in tasmanian devil that we were able to successfully amplify. sequencing of these ‘empty’ loci in the dunnart genome and comparison with the occupied sites in tasmanian devil revealed no evidence of transposon excision footprints , indicating that the absence of oc1_das from these loci in the dunnart is most likely the result of lineage-specific insertions subsequent to the divergence of dunnart and tasmanian devil.

two scenarios can explain the patterns we observe. first, oc1_das was horizontally transferred into a common ancestor of the dunnart and tasmanian devil, and the absence of orthologous copies at the three loci that we tested is due to the fact that the element continued actively transposing after the split of the species, and/or to the differential fixation of ancestrally polymorphic insertions in the two species. the second possibility is that oc <dig> was transferred independently in the dunnart and tasmanian devil lineages. our molecular estimate of the timing of oc1_das amplification  falls within the range of proposed divergence times for dunnart/tasmanian devil , which supports the idea that oc1_das was active during the speciation event that separated the tasmanian devil from its dasyurid sister group that includes about  <dig> species from four genera . whether the amplification of oc1_das played a role in this speciation event, as proposed for other transposition bursts  <cit> , is an interesting question that deserves further investigation.

it is also noteworthy that we found one full-length oc1_das transposase that is free of premature stop codons and frameshift mutations . while it is unclear whether this transposase is part of a complete autonomous element , it may be a source of functional protein capable of mobilizing other oc <dig> copies. the question of whether this family of element is still active in dasyuridae warrants further assessment, as to the best of our knowledge no active class ii transposon has yet been reported in marsupials.

with regard to the geographical location of htt of oc1_das, paleobiogeographical evidence strongly suggests that the dasyuridae, as well as the ancestor of the dunnart + tasmanian devil clade, originated in australia, which is where the tasmanian devil, dunnart, and most extant species of this family are still confined  <cit> . while the tasmanian devil is only found in tasmania, today its absence from mainland australia is due to a recent extinction  and tasmania was repeatedly connected to australia during glacial periods through land bridges emerging within bass strait until  <dig>  years ago  <cit> . thus, we can confidently conclude that the horizontal transfer of oc1_das took place in australia, which adds a new continent to the previously reported transfers of this element in asia, africa and south america  <cit> . our phylogenetic analysis places oc1_das within the old world oc <dig> clade, suggesting that the presence of this element in dasyurids is likely the result of a transcontinental movement of a vector species between australasia and the old world, rather than between australiasia and the new world . we believe the lack of resolution in the topology of the oc <dig> phylogeny, both within  and between species , reflects the fact that htt events involving this element took place within a relatively short timeframe preventing sufficient time for accumulation of diagnostic mutations. together these data further underscore the worldwide scale and pandemic-like pattern of these transposon invasions.

several hypotheses have been proposed to explain how transposable elements might be transferred between eukaryotic hosts, including transmission by contact of bodily fluids, feeding, or via some kind of vector such as a parasite  <cit> , reviewed in  <cit> . none of these routes can be favored at present in the case of the dasyuridae. the location of oc1_das in the old world clade of the oc <dig> phylogeny  does not help resolve this issue. however oc <dig> is an especially interesting case of htt in that alignment of the 5′ subterminal region of the otherwise nearly identical consensus sequences from all taxa previously found to harbor horizontally-transferred copies of the element reveals two geographically distinct signatures . surprisingly, this subterminal region in oc1_das is made of a 382-bp fragment that is unique among all oc <dig> elements so far described . taxa that are found to share this region may provide evidence for concurrent htt and open the possibility that this region of the transposon could be used to identify direct donor or vector species in the future.

CONCLUSIONS
we provide evidence for a new case of htt of the transposon family oposcharlie <dig>  based on wgs of the tasmanian devil, sarcophilus harrisii, and molecular screening of closely-related marsupials. our bioinformatic analysis and pcr results indicate the htt event occurred ~ <dig> my ago. this finding expands one of the most widespread case of htt identified in eukaryotes to include another deeply diverged vertebrate lineage  and an additional continent . intriguingly, our estimated dating of this episode of htt coincides with a series of speciation events that have led to the diversification of this lineage of marsupials.
