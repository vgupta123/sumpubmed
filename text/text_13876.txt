BACKGROUND
maize  is the world’s most widely grown crop for food, animal feed, biofuel and other industrial materials, and displays the highest global grain production  <cit> . by  <dig>  it is estimated that the human population will reach  <dig> billion  <cit> . increasing yield while providing added nutritional value in maize is thus imperative to meet the growing nutritional demand of the huge global population  <cit> .

flavonoids are a class of phytochemicals containing a c6-c3-c <dig> carbon framework. based on the oxidation and saturation in the heterocyclic ring, flavonoids can be classified into six subclasses namely flavone, flavonol, flavanone, flavanol, anthocyanin and isoflavone  <cit> . flavonoids have potent anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic activities and they may thus offer protection against major diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, coronary heart diseases and tumor  <cit> . in plants, the major states of flavonoids are modified with sugar or hydroxyl moities to facilitate stable storage and confer various biological functions. moreover, the different colors exhibited by flavonoids can attract pollinators and thus are highly important in plant reproduction  <cit> . they can additionally function as an uv absorbing compounds protecting plants from the uv-b radiation  <cit> , and can also serve as anti-pathogen such as maysin and gca  in maize  <cit> . flavonoids are necessary for conditional male fertility in maize  <cit>  and are also involved in seed coat development  <cit> , regulating the transport of phytohormones  <cit> , and providing signals to symbionts in plants  <cit> . therefore, understanding flavonoid biosynthesis in maize and the genetic basis underlying natural variation of the contents of members of this compound class is essential for maize enhancement in terms both of improving its nutritional value and in maintaining yields by ensuring stress tolerance.

flavonoid biosynthesis is one of the most intensively studied areas in plant secondary metabolism, and synthesis of most flavonoids have the same steps which are highly evolutionarily conserved  <cit> . the synthesis starts with the formation of naringenin chalcone by chalcone synthase  encoded in maize by locus c <dig>   <cit> . the product naringenin chalcone is then converted by chalcone isomerase  to generate the flavanone naringenin, which serves as a key precursor for various flavonoids  <cit> . through the action of flavanone-3′-hydroxylase enzyme , naringenin can then be converted into another flavanone, eriodictyol  <cit> . the biosynthesis of flavones begins with flavanones. flavones are often o- or c- glycosylated by glycosyl transferases. there are two major different classes of flavone synthase , fnsi and fnsii. fnsi type enzymes are soluble fe2+ oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases  and the maize fnsi- <dig> shows similar enzymatic activity with pcfnsi  <cit>  and produces flavone; while fnsii type enzymes are oxygen- and nadph-dependent cytochrome p <dig> membrane-bound monooxygenases  <cit> . generally, the fns protein can prepare aglycone backbones prior to final o-linked modifications  <cit> . on the other hand, the well characterized f2h  can initiate the hydroxylation of flavanones to the 2-hydroxyflavanones. 2-hydroxyflavanones then serves as the substrate  <cit>  for c-glucosylation to form various flavones 6-c- or 8-c-glucosides  <cit>  with the accompany of c-glycosyltransferase  . the maize f2h  was identified through a genome wide expression and chip analysis, and co-expression of zmf2h <dig> and ugt708a <dig> results in the formation of flavone c-glycosides  <cit> .

besides the synthetic enzymes involved in the pathway, considerable regulation by transcription factors  has been elucidated. the much studied pericarp <dig>  is an r2r3-myb transcription factor which can control the accumulation of various phenylpropanoids by activating a subset of flavonoid biosynthetic genes  <cit> . the c <dig> like r2r3-myb and r <dig> like bhlh interacting factors also activate the pathway  <cit> . flavonoid synthesis is completed in the cytoplasm; however, the final location of different flavonoids is diverse and as such transport processes are necessary for flavonoid movement within and between cells. three kinds of transporters namely proton-dependent transporters  <cit> , atp binding cassette-type transporters  <cit>  and mate-type transporters  <cit>  may be involved in these transport processes. natural variations in these tfs and enzymes contribute to the divergence of flavonoid accumulation. many genes in the flavonoid pathway have been cloned using a combination of classical genetics and biochemistry, however recently transposon based mutagenesis and t-dna tagging approaches have also been employed. in maize, dozens of genes involving in flavonoid biosynthesis were identified based on linkage analysis, transposon tagging approaches and homology-based cloning  <cit> , however, our understanding of the genetic control of the biosynthetic pathways underlying maize flavonoids biosynthesis remains fragmentary  <cit> .

in recent years, the rapid development of metabolomics and adoption of diverse populations for genetic mapping has provided us with unprecedented knowledge concerning the regulation of the abundance of the diverse chemical components in plants  <cit> . with the aid of high-throughput genotyping and metabolomics data, metabolic qtl were identified in a rice zhenshan  <dig> and minghui  <dig> recombinant inbred line  population, and some of the candidate genes for flavonoid content were further validated by examining over-expression transgenic rice lines  <cit> . a novel gene  was recently identified to be responsible for the production of flavonol 3-o-gentiobioside 7-o-rhamnoside  in an arabidopsis ril population  <cit> . in maize, hundreds of loci associated with metabolites from multiple pathways including flavonoid metabolism were identified, following genome wide association studies  on a diverse maize population that revealing the genetic influences underlying metabolic variation  <cit> . in addition, near isogenic lines  containing p1-rr and p1-ww were used to study the co-expression and direct target genes of the r2r3-myb transcription factor p <dig>  <cit> . since p <dig> was proven to regulate some well-known genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis, such as fls <dig> and a <dig> through targeted molecular experiments  <cit> , this study represented a great advance to systematically comprehend its gene regulatory circuitry. maysin  present in maize silks confers natural resistance to the corn earworm , which can cause severe damages on maize in the americas  <cit> . two loci that are capable of conferring salmon silks phenotypes, salmon silks  <dig>  and salmon silks  <dig>  were identified through qtl mapping  <cit>  in  <dig>  and previous genetic analyses predicted p <dig> to be epistatic to the salmon silk mutation  <cit> . based on the available sm <dig> and sm <dig> mapping information and knowledge of the genes regulated by p <dig>  <cit> , the molecular identification of the sm <dig> and sm <dig> gene products are revealed as a udp-rhamnose synthase and a rhamnosyl transferase, respectively  <cit> . the molecular characterization of sm <dig> and sm <dig> therefore completes the maysin biosynthetic pathway. it can thus be anticipated that deep probing of further profiling studies will facilitate the elucidation of the genetic complexity of maize flavonoid biosynthesis. indeed, integrative approaches are increasingly applied to enhance our understanding of metabolic pathway structure and regulation and how these affect the end-phenotypes of plants  <cit> .

previously, comprehensive metabolic profiling using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry  was carried out in mature maize kernels coming from several populations. combined linkage analysis and gwas was carried out on the resultant datasets which led to the identification of a variety of loci involved in multiple biosynthetic pathways  <cit> . taking advantage of the informative dataset generated from these previous studies, we here combine genetic mapping, metabolite profiling and gene regulatory network analysis to further enhance understanding of the maize flavonoid pathway. to this end the function of three candidate genes, including two maize udp-glycosyltransferases  and an oxygenase which belongs to the flavone synthase super family, was revealed through preliminary molecular functional characterizations including re-sequencing to access allelic variance and candidate gene association as well as reverse genetic experiments employing transgenic approaches. we discuss the obtained results not only in the context of our understanding of maize flavonoid biosynthesis but also in the context of maize genetic improvement both from the perspective of its nutritional content and in terms of its ability to withstand biotic and abiotic stress.

RESULTS
variation of flavonoids in different maize populations
an association mapping panel  and two ril populations were planted in multiple environments  and the mature kernels harvested from these six field experiments were used for lc-ms/ms based metabolite profiling. in our previous metabolome-based gwas study,  <dig> metabolite features were identified in the amp  <cit> .  <dig> of these  <dig> metabolite features with chemical or putative annotations were analyzed in bb and zy ril populations subsequently  <cit> . in this study, we extract the profile of flavonoids from these previous datasets, which includes  <dig> flavonoids and five of them were chemically annotated. briefly, these  <dig> flavonoids can be classified into flavones, flavanones, anthocyanins and methoxylated flavonoid. among them,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> flavonoids were found in ampe <dig>  ampe <dig>  bbe <dig>  bbe <dig>  zye <dig>  zye <dig>  respectively,  <dig> flavonoids were detected in all the six environments . the amp and both ril populations manifested great diversity in their flavonoid levels , as indicated by the distribution of the log <dig> value of fold changes . in amp, all flavonoids have broad-sense heritability  greater than  <dig>  and over 65% of flavonoids have h <dig> greater than  <dig> . over 45% and 60% of flavonoids have h <dig> greater than  <dig>  in bb and zy populations, respectively . correlation coefficient networks were also constructed based on flavonoid levels detected in each experiment, respectively, which demonstrated a clear separation between methoxylated flavonoids and other flavonoids, and most flavones were consistently linked to each other with r >  <dig>  .table  <dig> detailed information of  <dig> flavonoids detected in this study

gwas for flavonoid levels
a total of  <dig> loci were identified by gwas at significance level of p ≤  <dig>  × 10− <dig> in two experiments  . briefly,  <dig> loci were identified for  <dig> flavonoids in ampe <dig>  with an r <dig>  ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> % and a mean of  <dig> %; while  <dig> loci were detected for  <dig> flavonoids in ampe <dig>  each locus could explain phenotypic variation ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> %, with a mean of  <dig> % . of the  <dig> common flavonoids for which significant loci were detected in both experiments, a total of  <dig> and  <dig> loci were detected in ampe <dig> and ampe <dig>  respectively, and  <dig> of which were conserved for the same flavonoids in both experiments . the detailed information for gwas results including p value and r <dig> of each locus, physical position and minor allele frequency  of lead snp and the most likely candidate gene and its annotation are provided in additional file 4: table s <dig>  all potential candidate genes and their functional annotations within 100 kb  of the loci identified from gwas are listed in additional file 6: table s <dig> table  <dig> summary of significant loci-trait associations identified by gwas and qtl identified by linkage mapping

linkage mapping for flavonoid levels in the two ril populations
for the bb population,  <dig> and  <dig> qtl were mapped for  <dig> flavonoids in bbe <dig> and bbe <dig>  respectively . a total of  <dig> qtl were detected for the  <dig> common flavonoids in both experiments ,  <dig> qtl of which were conserved for the same flavonoid in both experiments . the percentage of phenotypic variation  that each qtl could explain ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> %, with a mean of  <dig> % . twenty-nine qtl that explained greater than 10% of the phenotypic variation  were identified.

in the zy population, a total of  <dig> qtl were detected in the two experiments . each qtl could explain between  <dig>  and  <dig> % of phenotypic variation, with an average variation of  <dig> %.  <dig> qtl were identified that explained greater than 10% of the variation . specifically,  <dig> qtl were detected for  <dig> flavonoids in zye <dig> , with an r <dig> range of  <dig>  to  <dig> % and a mean of  <dig> %, while in zye <dig>   <dig> qtl were identified for  <dig> flavonoids  and an r <dig> range of  <dig> – <dig> % with a mean of  <dig> % . of the  <dig> common flavonoids for which could detected qtl in both experiments, a total of  <dig> and  <dig> qtl were detected in zye <dig> and zye <dig>  respectively,  <dig> of which were conserved for the same flavonoids in both experiments .

linkage mapping results from both bb and zy populations indicated that most flavonoid qtl were identified with moderate effects , while a relatively small portion showed major effects . the identified qtl in both ril populations are evenly distributed across the maize genome, and detailed information for the qtl results, including logarithm of odds  value, 2-lod confidence interval, explained phenotypic variation  of each qtl, as well as candidate genes and their annotations are provided in additional files  <dig> and 8: tables s <dig> and s <dig>  two and four flavonoids qtl hot spots were observed across the maize genome in the bb and zy population, respectively, determined by using  <dig> permutations at the level of  <dig>  . these qtls were shared by flavonoids that are biochemically related and three known flavonoid pathway genes  located in hot spots on chromosome  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively .

in additional file 9: table s <dig>  the co-localization of qtl and/or significant loci identified across different environments or different populations is summarized. overall,  <dig> trait-loci combinations that are  <dig> qtls corresponding to  <dig> traits were detected in more than one environments or populations  in this study . among them,  <dig> combinations  were detected in more than two environments which including seven combinations  identified in four environments. detailed analyses of the candidate genes underlying these loci will almost certainly provide useful further information concerning the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway.

candidate genes revealed by multiple evidences
in our previous study, a primary regulatory network consisted of  <dig> candidate genes for the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway was constructed using an eqtl and qgwas method based on the expression level of  <dig> known maize flavonoid pathway genes  <cit> . twelve of these  <dig> genes  were finally involved in the primary network. moreover, using the same eqtl and qgwas criteria, a secondary network containing  <dig> genes was constructed based on the genes present in the primary network. here, we compared the newly found genes in the primary  and secondary network  with the candidate genes suggested from gwas and linkage mapping to identify overlapped genes. briefly,  <dig> and  <dig> genes from the primary and secondary network were found in our genetic mapping results , respectively .table  <dig> candidate genes of flavonoid biosynthetic pathway revealed by multiple evidences

* and #represent the genes from primary regulatory network and secondary regulatory network associated with the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway, respectively




in table  <dig>  we summarized genes for which multiple lines of evidence were provided, i.e., these are genes repeatedly identified in multiple populations or across multiple environments or overlapped genes between the result of network analysis and genetic mapping . three of the  <dig> genes from the primary network and  <dig> of the  <dig> genes from the secondary network mentioned above were detected in more than two environments or for more than two flavonoids in one environment, respectively . these genes were subsequently prioritized for further functional characterization. 40% of these  <dig> candidate genes revealed by multiple evidences mentioned above were annotated as enzymes, while functions of 29% of these genes remain unknown. genes that were annotated as transcription factor and participating in cellular organization only accounted for a small proportion .

functional verification of candidate genes underlying the natural variation of flavonoids in the mature maize kernel
according to the mapping results and multiple information regarding prior knowledge of flavonoid biosynthesis and functional annotation of candidate genes, we chose several genes that were supported by multiple evidences for further verification. a qtl on chromosome  <dig> was identified for the level of c-pentosyl-apigenin o-caffeoylhexoside  in the b73/by <dig> ril population . three genes, grmzm2g <dig> , grmzm2g <dig>  and grmzm2g <dig>  which are all annotated as flavonoids 3-o-glucosyltransferase are located within this qtl. ugt <dig> is about 12kb upstream of ugt <dig>  and both genes were identified as targets of the r2r3-myb transcript factor p <dig>  <cit> . ugt <dig> co-expressed with several genes involved in the flavonoid pathway, such as c <dig> , chi <dig>  and pr <dig>   <cit> . moreover, ugt <dig>  ugt <dig> and ugt <dig> all show sequence similarity with the rice c-glycosyltransferase . however, only ugt <dig> has been putatively identified, on the basis of homology, to be a bifunctional c- and o-glycosyltransferase, and ugt <dig> and ugt <dig>  is unable to produce apigenin 6-c-glucoside following supply of 2-hydroxynaringenin as a flavonoid receptor  <cit> . the function of ugt <dig> in the flavonoid biosynthesis has, however, been investigated using a re-sequencing and candidate gene association method, whereby some proposed functional variations were revealed  <cit> .fig.  <dig> a qtl containing three ugts and re-sequencing and candidate association analysis of ugt <dig>  a qtl mapping result for the level of c-pentosyl-apigenin o-caffeoylhexoside  in the mature maize kernel. lod values are shown as a function of their genetic positions. and the candidate genes are shown as red arrows. b phylogenetic tree of selected flavonoid glycosyltransferases. candidate genes in the qtl region on chromosome  <dig> are in red. the genbank accession numbers for the sequences are shown in the parentheses: at3rhat ; at3glct ; at3arat ; vv3glct ; acf3galt ; ph3galt ; pf3glct ; ph3glct ; hv3glct ; zm3glct ; at5glct ; ph5glct ; pf5glct ; vh5glct ; csf3g2″glct ; mtugt72l <dig> ; oscgt ; at7rhat ; at7glct ; dbb5glct ; gt3′glct ; ntis5s ; sb7glct ; bpa3g2″glcat ; caugt <dig>  f3g6″glct ; cmf7g2″rhat ; cs <dig> rhat, csif7g6″rhat ; pha3g6″rhat, ugt79g <dig> ; ata3g2″xylt, ugt79b <dig> ; atf3g2″glct, ugt79b <dig> ; f3ggt <dig>  aca3ga2″xylt ; ipa3g2″glct . c boxplot showing the distribution of relative metabolite level  of lines from the association population with two parental alleles at snp <dig> and snp <dig>  d sequence polymorphisms between b <dig> and by <dig> in ugt <dig> . the snp identity is indicated by the position starting from the codon atg. the b <dig> allele  is before the slash, the latter is by <dig>  “xxx” indicates the deletion of three bases. abbreviations: a3g, anthocyanin 3-o-glucoside; a3ga, anthocyanin 3-o-galactoide; f3g, flavonol 3-o-glucoside; f7g, flavonoid 7-o-glucoside; 3arat, 3-o-arabinosyltransferase; 3glct, 3-o-glucosyltransferase; 3′glct, 3′-o-glucosyltransferase; 3galt, 3-o-galactosyltransferase; 3rhat,3-o-rhamnosyltransferase; 5glct, 5-o-glucosyltransferase; 7glct, 7-o-glucosyltransferase; 7rhat, 7-o-rhamnosyltransferase; 2″glct, 2″-o-glucosyltransferase; 2″rhat, 2″-o-rhamnosyltransferase; 2″xylt, 2″-o-xylosyltransferase; 6″rhat, 6″-o-rhamnosyltransferase; cgt, c-glucosyltransferase; ntis5a, salicylate-induced glucosyltransferase. abbreviations for species: ac, actinidia chinensis; at, arabidopsis thaliana; bp, bellis perennis; cm, citrus maxima; csa, crocus sativus; csi, citrus sinensis; db, dorotheanthus bellidiformis; gt, gentiana triflora; hv, hordeum vulgare; ip, ipomoea purpurea; nt, nicotiana tabacum; os, oryza sativa; pf, perilla frutescens; ph, petunia hybrida; sb, scutellaria baicalensis; vh, verbena hybrida; vv, vitis vinifera; zm, zea mays  <cit> 




herein we looked into the genetic variations between the two parental lines of the bb ril population  and found seven snps between the parents in the coding sequence of ugt <dig>  which could cause nonsynonymous mutations . three pairs of kasp  primers which can successfully genotype three  of the seven snps were used to test the association panel aiming to validate the function of these three snps in ugt <dig>  they all exhibited a minor allele frequency  of more than  <dig> . at the sites snp <dig>  and snp <dig> , phenotypic values of lines with the alleles from the two parents were significantly different . significant phenotypic differences between the lines harboring b <dig> alleles and by <dig> alleles were also observed for several other flavonoids detected in this study. for instance, the levels of three apigenin derivatives, chrysoeriol and six chrysoeriol derivatives, four tricin derivatives and cyanidin 3-o-glucoside detected in lines with two parental alleles at snp <dig> were significantly different. similarly, the levels of cyanidin 3-o-glucoside, chrysoeriol di-c-hexoside, 3′,4′,5′-tricetin-o-hexoside and apigenin c-pentosyl-o-coumaroylhexoside in lines with two parental alleles at snp <dig> were significantly different . in addition, we conducted candidate association analysis using these three snps - snp <dig> displayed the lowest p value and can therefore be considered as the most promising functional site among these three snps . compared to snp <dig>  snp <dig> was associated with more flavonoids, which may suggest that it exhibits broader substrate specificity.

grmzm2g <dig>  is around 142 kb away from ugt <dig>  which is associated with the level of apigenin c-pentosyl-c-pentoside  as revealed by our previous genome wide association analysis, and an amino acid substitution  was suggested as one of the functional genetic variants  <cit> . in the present study, we generated over-expression lines by ectopically expressing grmzm2g <dig> under the control of the maize ubiquitin promoter in the rice cultivar zhonghua <dig> . we detected the level of flavonoids in the rice leaves of the wild type and t <dig> individuals of two over-expression lines  . the level of more than half  of the detected flavonoids were significantly decreased in the over-expression lines. the fold change of these  <dig> flavonoids between the over-expression lines and wild type ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . among them, fold change between the over-expression lines and wild type of the level of apigenin c-pentosyl-c-pentoside was around  <dig> . along with apigenin c-pentosyl-c-pentoside, two other apigenin derivatives  were also affected . notably, the level of all the tricin derivatives detected here  was significantly decreased . moreover, the content of chrysoeriol, chrysoeriol o-hexoside and vitexin were also significantly decreased . however, no significant changes were found for the content of c-pentosyl-apigenin o-caffeoylhexoside, for which ugt <dig> was identified in the qtl region as mentioned above. hence, ugt <dig> and ugt <dig> but not ugt <dig> could be the causative genes for the variance of c-pentosyl-apigenin o-caffeoylhexoside. however, the transgenic result of ugt <dig> can suggest its influence in the flavonoid biosynthesis. however, further biochemical assay is needed to strongly confirm the function and activity.fig.  <dig> transgenic result of ugt <dig>  a diagram of over-expression construct. b the bar plot showing the average mrna level of ugt <dig>  in the wild type  and over-expression lines  . c the bar plot showing the relative contents of apigenin c-pentosyl-c-pentoside  in the wt and ugt <dig> over-expression lines , * and ** represent the significant level of p <  <dig>  and p  <dig> , respectively




on chromosome  <dig>  gene grmzm5g <dig> was suggested to be important in determining the level of apigenin c-pentosyl-o-coumaroyl hexoside  by both linkage mapping in zong3/yu87- <dig> population  and gwas in ampe <dig> . grmzm5g <dig> is annotated as an oxoglutarate/iron-dependent oxygenase , which belongs to the oxygenase superfamily. however, grmzm5g <dig>  shows low sequence similarity with the well-known 2-odd genes, such as fns. oxy is one of the maize prolyl 4-hydroxylase family  members, which may play a role in tolerance to abiotic stresses, such as water-logging  <cit> . correlations between the content of various flavonoids and the expression level of oxy revealed that the content of chrysoeriol, chrysoeriol o-rhamnosyl-o-hexoside, tricin o-rhamnosyl-o-hexoside and 3′,4′,5′-tricetin o-rhamnosyl-o-hexoside, chrysoeriol o-hexoside, chrysoeriol di-c-hexoside and chrysoeriol c-hexosyl-o-rhamnoside were negatively correlated with expression level of oxy  . we further profiled the rice over-expression lines and quantified the level of  <dig> flavonoids . the levels of  <dig> flavonoids were significantly decreased compared with that of the wild type . within these  <dig> flavonoids, the content of six flavonoids was negatively correlated with the oxy expression level. based on the result, we speculate that the oxy may act as a competitor or inhibitor of the flux through the apigenin, chrysoeriol and tricin branches of flavonoid metabolism.fig.  <dig> linkage and association mapping of oxy and validation by transformation. a and c diagram of linkage mapping and gwas results for the level of apigenin c-pentosyl-o-coumaroylhexoside in maize kernel. lod values are shown as a function of their genetic positions. and the peak snp is located within oxy . b the bar plot showing the mrna level of oxy in wild type  and over-expression lines  . d plot of correlation between the content of different flavonoids and the normalized expression level of gene oxy in association panel.

in addition, abundant genetic variants between zong <dig> and yu87- <dig> in the promoter region of oxy were observed . cis-element prediction using plantcare  found a variant between the sequences of the two parental lines at the mbs ii . the variant at this binding site may affect the function of oxy through transcriptional regulation, as suggested by the finding in petunia hybrida  <cit> . indeed, a strong cis-eqtl for oxy was identified in our previous study, which may suggest the potential function of this genetic variant at the upstream of this gene .

to investigate the co-expression mode of the above mentioned genes, a qgwas-based network was constructed . grmzm5g <dig>  is not in this network for no related genes found by using the threshold of p <  <dig>  × 10− <dig> . ugt <dig> clustered independently from the rest. four well-known genes involving in the flavonoids biosynthesis are present in the co-expression network, such as a <dig> , c <dig> , chi <dig>  and whp <dig> .  <dig> uncharacterized genes are also revealed in the network, including a gene homologous to chalcone isomerase  and other  <dig> genes with unknown function or without direct functional annotations related to flavonoid biosynthesis.fig.  <dig> co-expression network for ugt <dig>  ugt <dig>  ugt <dig> and ugt <dig> based on a qgwas method. the red indicates these four genes. the green diamond indicates the known enzyme involved in the flavonoid pathway. the blue circle indicates the uncharacterized co-expressing genes




discussion
metabolomics, which promotes the study of plant metabolism, offers the capacity to speed up the breeding process toward high yielding and nutritional crops  <cit> . with the advent of high-efficiency metabolic profiling and high-throughput sequencing technologies, studies of genetic dissection of metabolomics diversity based on gwas and linkage analysis have been reported recently in several plant organisms such as maize  <cit> , rice  <cit> , tomato  and arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . in addition to the dataset generated from our previous untargeted metabolomics-based genetic mapping, here we focus on the flavonoids that were found in the mature kernel harvested from an association panel and two ril populations grown across multiple environments  <cit> . based on a combined analysis , we firstly dissected the genetic control of the variation of  <dig> flavonoids. this indicated that few loci with large effect  along with more loci with minor to modest genetic contribution underlie the variation of flavonoids level in the mature maize kernel, and the average effect that each locus contributes is modest . since maize kernel is a storage tissue, we would assume that more loci responsible for flavonoid variation can be identified in the mature kernel as compared with vegetative tissues such as leaves. it will however be worthwhile to investigate the accumulation and distribution of flavonoids in diverse tissue types in further research. secondly, we are able to propose dozens of promising candidate genes involved in maize flavonoid biosynthesis. specifically, three ugts which are all evolutionary close to rice cgt , are located in one glycosylated flavone qtl region . the function of ugt <dig> was elucidated as having both c- and o- glucosyltransferase ability  <cit> , while the biochemical activity of ugt <dig> and ugt <dig> remains unknown. re-sequencing the two parental lines as well as the whole association panel and subsequent candidate association analysis have provided us with the potential functional genetic variants of ugt <dig>  however, whether and if so how the two amino acid replacements in the coding region of ugt <dig> influence the protein structure and enzymatic activity remains to be answered. in addition given the genomic location of these three ugt genes, it will also be interesting to look into the genomic divergence of the region covering the ugt <dig> locus between diverse maize germplasm  from an evolutionary perspective. on the other hand, we found significant decreases of several flavonoids in ugt <dig> overexpressing rice leaves. and in our co-expression network, ugt <dig>  ugt <dig> and ugt <dig> are clustered with four well-characterized flavonoids biosynthesis pathway genes, while ugt <dig> clustered independently from the rest. further molecular and biochemical evidence will be needed to provide the exact mechanism underlying this observation. in addition, the maize oxy gene exerted a negative influence on the levels of a broad range of flavones in the over-expressing rice leaves.

it has been documented that flavonoids have potent bioactivities which are beneficial for human health. epidemiologic studies have suggested that a diet rich in flavones exhibits some anti-carcinogenic as well as anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory bioactivities . flavonoids also have antioxidant and anti-diabetic potential when added to food  <cit> . furthermore, flavonoids also play an important role in protecting the plant itself against biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . in particularly, the c- glycosyl flavone has been revealed to participate in protection against uv-b radiation and defense against pathogens  <cit> . it is thus essential to find functional genes and understand their regulatory networks as an approach for biofortification of these valuable compounds in maize  <cit> . the genes oxy and ugts investigated in this study are promising targets for further crop flavonoid content improvement through favorable allele pyramiding or metabolic engineering techniques on the basis of intensive allele mining and a full understanding of gene regulatory network. the non-targeted metabolomics approach, as adopted here, has the potential to enable the findings of novel genes and pathways. to realize this in the future, an elaborate design which takes into account biological or physiological context would also be helpful.

CONCLUSIONS
in our current study, we explored the genetic influences on the flavonoid biosythensis in maize kernel based on integrating the genomic, transcriptomic and metabolomic information which provided a rich source of potential candidate genes. as indicated here and in our previous study  <cit> , the integrated genomics based genetic mapping strategy is highly efficient for defining the complexity of functional genetic variants and their respective regulatory networks as well as in helping to select candidate genes and allelic variance before embarking on laborious transgenic validations. in a similar vein, a maize protoplast complementation system developed by casas et al  was very recently proposed  <cit>  as a means to probe the activity of metabolic enzymes in an approach that circumvents the need for transgenic plants. this method as well as the approach we took in the current study offers new opportunities to advance beyond the qtl/association mapping approach and towards a complete understanding of maize flavonoid biosynthesis.
