BACKGROUND
salt stress has a major effect on food production and quality worldwide by limiting the growth, development, and yield of crops  <cit> . more than one-fifth of the world's arable land is now under the threat of salt stress. as the global population increases, water resource management is deteriorating and environmental pollution is worsening; salinization of land is becoming more extreme and has begun to hinder development of agricultural economics.

salt stress can damage plants by several mechanisms, including water deficit, ion toxicity, nutrient imbalance, and oxidative stress  <cit> . plants respond and adapt to salt stress through a series of biochemical and physiological changes, involving expression and coordination of many genes  <cit> . gene expression in the model plant arabidopsis thaliana in response to salt and other abiotic stresses has been studied extensively  <cit> . however, conclusions derived from research conducted on arabidopsis may not be applicable to other species, so research on species-specific responses to a particular abiotic stress is needed. fabaceae is the third-largest family of flowering plants in the world, and contains many important crops that provide humans and animals with proteins  <cit> . legumes are also important sources of edible oil and industrial fuel. medicago truncatula is used as a model legume plant because of features such as a relatively small genome, self-pollination, a short life cycle, and the ability to form root nodules in association with rhizobia  <cit> .

high-throughput expression profiling, such as microarray technology, has been used widely to study abiotic-stress-responsive mechanisms in plants. transcriptional profiling of chickpea using a cdna microarray revealed that  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes were differentially regulated after drought, cold, and high-salinity treatment, respectively  <cit> . the iron-stress response of two near-isogenic soybean  lines was monitored using the affymetrix genechip soybean genome array, which indicated a transcription factor mutation appears to cause iron use inefficiency in soybeans  <cit> . many genes of transgenic arabidopsis over-expressing pea abr <dig>  exhibited different expression patterns under salt stress compared to the wild type, based on a 70-mer oligonucleotide probe microarray, indicating that abr <dig> plays a role in mediating stress tolerance  <cit> . another salt-stress response study of the root apex of m. truncatula using the mt16k+ microarray identified  <dig> transcription factors exhibiting significant expression changes; some of these transcription factors belong to the ap2/erebp and myb transcription factor family  <cit> . based on microarray analysis, genes involved in abiotic stress responses have been identified and categorized into two types according to the protein they code for  <cit> . the first type of genes expressed functional proteins, such as water-channel protein and membrane transporter protein; the second type was involved in signal transduction and expression regulatory processes, such as transcription factors and kinases  <cit> . transcription factors could bind to the cis-elements of many target genes and regulate their expression, so these are good candidates for transgenic research to improve salt resistance among crops  <cit> .

the ap2/erebp family, which comprises a large group of transcription factors, plays functionally important roles in plant growth and development, especially in hormonal regulation and response to biotic and abiotic stress  <cit> . in arabidopsis,  <dig> ap2/erebp transcription factors were classified into five subfamilies, including dreb/cbf , erf , ap <dig> , rav , and one specific gene, al <dig>  based on similarities in their dna-binding domain   <cit> . the arabidopsis genome contains six dreb1/cbf and eight dreb <dig> genes  <cit> . dreb1a/cbf <dig>  dreb1b/cbf <dig>  and dreb1c/cbf <dig> appear to be rapidly and transiently induced by cold; they are major transcription factors required for the expression of cold-inducible genes  <cit> . dreb2a and dreb2b genes are induced by dehydration and high salinity but not by cold stress, and they play very important roles in the osmotic stress response  <cit> . expression of dreb1d/cbf <dig> is up-regulated by abscisic acid , drought, salt, and cold stress  <cit> . atdreb1e/ddf <dig>  and atdreb1f/ddf <dig>  encoding another two ap <dig> transcription factors of the dreb1/cbf subfamily, are induced by high-salinity stress  <cit> . over-expression of the atdreb1f/ddf <dig> gene causes dwarfism and higher tolerance to salt stress, mainly by reducing levels of bioactive gibberellins  in transgenic arabidopsis  <cit> . transgenic plants over-expressing atdreb1e/ddf <dig> share a similar phenotype  <cit> . dreb2c, another member of the dreb <dig> transcription factor family, is induced by salt and cold, and transgenic plants over-expressing dreb2c become aba hypersensitive  <cit> . the signal-transduction pathways in response to abiotic stress are complex, and the exact mechanisms require further study.

recent research has isolated many dreb transcription factors from soybean, an important fabaceae member, including gmdreba, gmdrebb, gmdrebc, gmdreb <dig>  gmdreb <dig>  and gmdreb <dig>  expression of gmdreba and gmdrebb is induced by salt, drought, and cold stress in the leaves of seedlings. by contrast, transcription levels of gmdrebc are apparently induced in roots by salt, drought, and aba treatments, but are not significantly affected in leaves  <cit> . these results indicate that these three genes function differently in response to abiotic stresses in soybean. gmdreb <dig> is induced by cold, salt, drought stress, and aba treatment, conferring tolerance to drought and high-salinity stress in transgenic plants  <cit> . in contrast, gmdreb <dig> is induced by cold stress only, and transgenic arabidopsis are more tolerant to freezing, salt, and drought stress  <cit> .

mtcbf <dig>  mtcbf <dig>  mtdreb1c/cbf <dig>  and mtdreb2a have been identified in m. truncatula. the expression levels of mtcbf <dig> and mtcbf <dig> increased during treatment at 8°c and 6°c  <cit> . over-expression of mtcbf3/dreb1c suppressed shoot growth and enhanced the freezing tolerance of transgenic m. truncatula  <cit> . this finding indicates that mtcbf <dig> and mtcbf3/dreb1c may play a critical role in inducing the cold-acclimation-specific  gene, which in turn increases freezing tolerance. in contrast, transcription levels of mtdreb2a are significantly up-regulated in roots by salt and drought stress treatments. transgenic m. truncatula 
mtdreb2a  plants exhibit significantly dwarfed seedlings  <cit> , but the stress tolerance of transgenic lines requires further study. moreover, the relationships among the mtdreb/cbfs genes are still unknown.

agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated transformation of roots as well as transient transfection by vacuum infiltration of intact leaves is widely used in function analysis in legumes  <cit> . the transient transformation methods are faster and easier compared with the stable transformation technique.

in previous research, we constructed an expression database for m. truncatula under salt stress  <cit> . in this study, we implemented a more detailed pathway analysis of transcriptomics dynamics. in addition, we identified a novel transcription factor gene, mtcbf <dig>  which was induced by salt, drought, cold, and abscisic acid. over-expression of mtcbf <dig> in transgenic arabidopsis and m. truncatula improved tolerance to abiotic stress and activated expression of downstream genes containing dre elements, indicating that mtcbf <dig> might be a good candidate gene for improving the stress tolerance of transgenic plants.

RESULTS
root length measurement, selection of time-points and salt concentration
we evaluated the root growth status of m. truncatula by measuring root lengths under different salt stress intensities at different time-points. measurements were recorded at 12: <dig> pm every day for  <dig> week. raw data for root length, calculated average length, growth rate and standard error values are presented in additional file  <dig>  the percentage increase in root length per day under different salt concentrations was calculated as a measure of growth rate . roots treated with distilled water were used as the control . the difference between a root growth rate and the value one day prior was tested using student's t-test.

the growth rate of roots subjected to  <dig> mm nacl stress was significantly different  after one day of treatment in contrast to other salt concentrations. subsequently, roots treated with  <dig> mm and  <dig> mm nacl also showed significantly different growth rates . according to the t-test results, nacl concentrations could be divided into three groups: 60~ <dig> mm 120~ <dig> mm, and 180~ <dig> mm, corresponding to low, intermediate and high levels of salt stress, respectively. in order to induce a higher frequency of expression changes and maintain seedling activity simultaneously, as some seedlings under a high level of salt stress ceased growth from the third day of stress treatment, we chose  <dig> mm nacl and selected days  <dig> and  <dig> as time-points to investigate the effects of a high level of salt stress on m. truncatula seedlings. in addition,  <dig> h post-treatment was added as a time-point to examine the early stages of the stress response. the i <dig> value is defined as the concentration of nacl that reduces the rate of root growth by 50% relative to a control; this value was used to measure the salt tolerance level. the i <dig> of arabidopsis is about  <dig> mm nacl  <cit> . our salt concentration gradient tests revealed that the i <dig> of m. truncatula jemalong a <dig> was also about  <dig> mm based on root lengths measured after one day of salt stress , which indicated the salt sensitivity of m. truncatula.

quantitative real-time pcr validation of microarray experiments
microarray experiment design and related protocols were described in our previous work  <cit> . to validate the microarray results, five probe sets were selected to confirm expression differences with quantitative real-time pcr : a myb transcription factor , a 2og-fe oxygenase family protein , a delta l-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase , an ap2-erebp transcription factor , and a dehydrin-like protein . selection of these probe sets was based on their statistically significant up-regulated expression and abundant annotations. 2og-fe oxygenase is reported to be involved in plant defense  <cit> , and l-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase plays a role in the drought stress response  <cit> . several dehydrin-like proteins show diverse accumulation in many plants in response to cold and heat stress  <cit> . many members of the transcription factor family ap2-erebp and myb are reported to be involved in abiotic stress responses  <cit> . the qrt-pcr method is much more sensitive than microarray analysis for detecting transcript expression and can be used as a confirmatory tool for microarray results  <cit> . although the quantitative values differed considerably, the same trend was observed in the qrt-pcr and microarray analyses . the primers used are listed in additional file  <dig> , and mtactin  <cit>  was used as a control.

gene expression profiles and pathway enrichment analysis
we analyzed expression data for  <dig>  m. truncatula probe sets at the three time-points using stem software  <cit>  to cluster the expression patterns. a total of  <dig> significant expression profiles were generated based on a p-value of  <dig> . based on the expression patterns, profiles were classified into two categories : those with an up-regulated pattern, including profile b, d, e, f and k, assigned with  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> probe sets, respectively ; and those with a down-regulated pattern, including profile a, c, g, h, i, and j assigned with  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> probe sets, respectively . probe sets belonging to each profile were subjected to an enrichment analysis at the pathway level using the pathexpress tool  <cit> , and significant pathway distributions for each profile were shown . probe sets related to primary metabolism  were mainly repressed in response to salt stress. of all the probe sets that might be involved in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway, half of the probe sets had been up-regulated. the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway was suppressed, as more than half of the probe sets involved in this pathway were down-regulated. however, the six probe sets involved in the isoflavonoid biosynthesis pathway were all up-regulated: two isoflavone 7-o-methyltransferases  in profile b; an isoflavone 7-o-methyltransferase  and an isoflavone 3'-hydroxylase  in profile d; and two isoflavone reductases  in profile e.

pathway enrichment analysis was done by pathexpress tool. only statistic significant  pathways left. profiles numbered from a to k were listed in figure  <dig>  the "no. of enzymes" column means how many enzymes of each pathway are in the array, the "no. of enzymes submitted" column means how many enzymes belong to each profile.

we utilized the genebins tool  <cit>  for additional pathway analyses, because probe sets of m. truncatula were more annotated by genebins than pathexpress. we selected probe sets that were up- or down-regulated by more than two-fold at each time-point versus values at  <dig> h for genebins analysis and to assess their distribution on the stem-generated profiles. additional file  <dig> summarizes these probe sets and their corresponding profiles, along with the genebins functional annotation. those probe sets were also functionally categorized using the genebins second-level ontology. almost all probe sets belonging to profiles a, c, g, h, i, and j were classified as down-regulated, and almost all probe sets belonging to profiles b, d, e, f, and k were up-regulated. unclassified  probe sets were not subjected to the analysis described below. profile a displayed a continuing downward trend. most probe sets in this profile were classified into the main metabolism category, and the number of probe sets increased with longer exposure to salt. this result might be caused by the inhibition of plant growth by salt stress, which causes water potential, osmotic, and nutritional imbalances  <cit> . other subcategories of profile a contained a considerable proportion of probe sets including genes for translation, folding and sorting, degradation, and signal transduction. the translation process was repressed as probe sets assigned to this category were more down-regulated; this indicated that growth activity in seedlings was constrained by external stress at the translational level. the up-regulated profiles b, d, e, f, and k not only contained a considerable proportion of probe sets involved in primary metabolism processes , but also in secondary metabolism and information processes. the pathways metabolism of cofactors and vitamins, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, and biodegradation of xenobiotics all showed considerably more probe sets that were up-regulated than down-regulated. this indicates that the plants have a positive response mechanism against external harmful stress.

a novel member of cbf transcription factor in m. truncatula
we used probe consensus sequences of the array for a blastx search against the m. truncatula transcription factor  peptide sequences database, and found  <dig> probes that matched  the  <dig> tfs obtained from planttfdb  <cit> , excluding the probe sets of m. sativa and sinorhizobium meliloti. the  <dig> tfs were isolated for further cluster analysis using the mev tool  <cit>  based on their gene expression regulation and signal transduction role  <cit> . in the re-clustered results by expression profiles of the  <dig> tfs , eight tfs in one of the profiles that exhibited an up-regulating trend were selected for further analysis . of the eight tfs, the probe set mtr. <dig> .s1_at belonged to the ap2/erebp transcription factor family and shares the most similarities with the crt/dre binging factor  as indicated by a blast search against the ncbi nr database. seven other transcription factors belonged to the myb, nac, c3h, and c2h <dig> families. with the exception of the c3h family, members of these families are reportedly capable of abiotic stress responses  <cit> . as cbf tfs are reported to participate in many abiotic stress responses, mtr. <dig> .s1_at was further chosen for function validation. we named this novel member of the ap2/erebp transcription factor gene mtcbf <dig>  because previous studies have identified and analyzed mtcbf <dig>  mtcbf <dig>  and mtcbf <dig>  <cit> . mtcbf <dig> contained an open reading frame of 618-bp, encoding a protein of  <dig> amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of  <dig>  kd and a pi of  <dig> . the 618-bp sequence was submitted to genbank . to date, four cbf genes of medicago have been isolated , and two of these  have been proven to play roles in the response to cold stress  <cit> . however, the relationships among them are still unknown.

to examine the phylogenetic relationship of the dreb/cbf family, we compared the amino acid sequence of mtcbf <dig> with  <dig> dreb/cbf family members from arabidopsis, glycine max, and medicago truncatula . the phylogenetic analysis revealed that dreb/cbf proteins were grouped by species, and all the cbfs were clustered together according to dreb type. dreb1-type cbfs were clustered together. mtcbf <dig> was most similar to gmcbf <dig> and gmcbf <dig>  and in turn to mtcbf <dig> and mtcbf <dig>  mtcbf <dig> showed higher similarity to atdreb1/cbfs than to atdreb <dig>  therefore it was classified as a dreb1-type cbf. the amino acid sequence of mtcbf <dig> shared 57%  sequence identity against atcbf <dig>  which was higher than the identities between mtcbf <dig> and atcbf <dig> , atcbf <dig>  and atcbf <dig> , respectively.

we also compared the amino acid sequence of mtcbf <dig> with several dreb- <dig> related proteins. as shown in figure  <dig>  mtcbf <dig> protein had a conserved ap <dig> dna-binding domain similar to other cbf proteins. the cbf signature sequences xxaxxf, with the underlined residues conserved in all known cbf homologs, located downstream of the dsawr)  <cit>  as well as the c-terminal lwsy motif  <cit>  were also conserved in the mtcbf <dig> protein. the mtcbf <dig> protein contains dsawk instead of dsawr. as mentioned above, the amino acid sequence of the mtcbf <dig> protein shared 57% similarity with the arabidopsis cbf <dig> protein , indicating mtcbf <dig> is a homolog of atdreb1d/cbf <dig> 

we also checked the promoter sequence  of mtcbf <dig> using the place signal scan search program  <cit> . the promoter sequence contained many putative stress-responsive cis-elements such as abre , and recognition sites for myb, myc and wrky transcription factors . these cis-elements  and the corresponding transcription factors  play important roles in the aba signaling pathway and abiotic stress responses  <cit> . wrky transcription factors are suggested to be involved in response and adaptation to abiotic and/or biotic stresses  <cit> .

localization and transactivation of mtcbf <dig> protein
to determine its subcellular localization, mtcbf <dig> was fused in frame to the 5' terminus of the green fluorescent protein  reporter gene under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus dual 35s promoter , as well as a tobacco etch virus  enhancer. the recombinant constructs of the mtcbf4-gfp fusion gene and gfp alone were introduced into onion  epidermal cells via a gene gun . the mtcbf4-gfp fusion protein accumulated mainly in the nucleus, whereas gfp alone was present throughout the whole cell . thus, mtcbf <dig> was a nuclear-localized protein, which was consistent with its predicted function as a transcription factor.

the transactivation ability of mtcbf <dig> was analyzed using a yeast assay system. the gal <dig> dna-binding domain-mtcbf <dig> recombinant plasmid was transformed into yeast cells and assayed for its ability to activate transcription of the dual report genes his <dig> and lacz both controlled by the gal <dig> upstream activation sequence. yeast cells with the fusion plasmids harboring mtcbf <dig> grew on sd medium lacking histidine, and were stained blue in x-gal solution . these results indicated that mtcbf <dig> showed transactivation capability.

expression pattern of mtcbf <dig> under different abiotic stresses
we conducted a qrt-pcr to examine the expression pattern of mtcbf <dig> under different stress conditions. at  <dig> h after aba treatment, the transcript level of mtcbf <dig> had increased almost six-fold; thereafter, it decreased to the pretreatment level after  <dig> h . under drought stress, the transcription level of mtcbf <dig> began to increase within  <dig> h and continued to increase after  <dig> h . with regard to salt stress, the transcription level of mtcbf <dig> began to increase at  <dig> h and continued to increase after  <dig> h . treatment with cold stress yielded very interesting results; the transcription level of mtcbf <dig> rose sharply within  <dig> h after treatment compared to that of the non-treated control, then fell sharply but remained above the pretreatment level at  <dig> h, and then rose again to a much higher level at  <dig> h . taken together, these results reveal that mtcbf <dig> was induced by aba, drought, salt, and cold stimulation, indicating that it might play an important role in response to abiotic stresses and aba treatment.

over-expression of mtcbf <dig> improved drought and high-salinity tolerance in transgenic arabidopsis
the notable induction of mtcbf <dig> expression by multiple stresses indicated this gene might be involved in stress resistance. expression of mtcbf <dig> in transgenic arabidopsis was detected by rt-pcr . we randomly selected two independent t <dig> mtcbf <dig> over-expressing lines  for drought and salinity resistance testing. over-expression of mtcbf <dig> in both lines did not cause significant growth retardation compared with the wild type as indicated by inflorescence height and seed yield per plant .

three-week-old seedlings were used for drought tolerance assays. after  <dig> days without water, all pots were watered simultaneously and plant recovery and survival rate were recorded. t <dig> transgenic arabidopsis plants over-expressing mtcbf <dig> showed enhanced drought tolerance, as wild-type plants had wilted compared to transgenic lines l <dig> and l <dig> after drought treatment . overall,  <dig> %  of wild-type plants survived, whereas the survival rates of the 35s:mtcbf <dig> l <dig> and l <dig> transgenic plants were  <dig> %  and  <dig> % , respectively .

we tested the effect of nacl on germination of mtcbf4-over-expressing seeds. seed germination of the wild-type and transgenic plants did not differ under normal conditions. however, in the presence of  <dig> mm nacl seed germination differed significantly:  <dig> %  of the wild-type seeds germinated, whereas the germination rates of the 35s:mtcbf <dig> l <dig> and l <dig> transgenic lines were  <dig> %  and  <dig> % , respectively .

to determine the effect of mtcbf <dig> over-expression on post-germination salt tolerance,  <dig> d after germination transgenic and wild-type seedlings were carefully transferred to new plates containing different concentrations of nacl. at a nacl concentration of  <dig> to  <dig> mm, seedlings of both transgenic lines displayed better root growth than the wild type. however, at  <dig> mm nacl root growth was seriously inhibited and no significant difference was detected . the i <dig> of the mtcbf <dig> transgenic plants was  <dig> mm nacl, which exceeded that of wild-type arabidopsis . the results indicated over-expression of mtcbf <dig> in arabidopsis increased salt tolerance during both germination and early seedling growth.

since over-expression of mtcbf <dig> enhanced drought and salt stress tolerance in transgenic arabidopsis, we examined the changes in expression of abiotic stress

-responsive genes in these plants. six genes  that contain dre elements in their promoter regions and have been identified as downstream genes of atdrebs in arabidopsis  <cit>  were chosen for study. total rnas isolated from three-week-old wild-type, l <dig>  and l <dig> seedlings were used for qrt-pcr analysis. expression levels of all six genes were enhanced in mtcbf <dig> transgenic plants under normal growth conditions . these results indicated mtcbf <dig> up-regulated expression of downstream genes related to drought and salt stress responses.

over-expression of mtcbf <dig> enhances salt tolerance and induces two putative target genes in transient transgenic m. truncatula
to investigate the putative role of mtcbf <dig> in response to salt stress, we prepared transgenic composite m. truncatula jemalong a <dig> plants carrying a. rhizogenes-transformed roots over-expressing mtcbf <dig>  <cit> . the transgenic plants were identified by rfp detection . three weeks after inoculation, the seedlings were transferred to a new plate with salt-containing medium , and the root length was measured after one week. under normal conditions, there was no significant difference in growth between over-expressing and control plants. however, a significant increase  in primary roots growth in the mtcbf4-overexpressing lines compared with the control plants was detected on the salt-containing medium . another two representative cultivars of mtcbf4-overexpressing a. rhizogenes-transformed m. truncatula roots were also presented in additional file  <dig> 

further evidence was obtained by transient transfection of the leaves by vacuum infiltration  <cit> . mtcas <dig> and mtcas <dig>  belong to the cbf regulon  <cit> , so we detected the expression level of these two targets in d35s:mtcbf <dig> transgenic m. truncatula. under normal conditions, the induction rates of the two genes were about two-fold and three-fold, respectively, in d35s:mtcbf <dig> transgenic plants compared with the control plants . however, under salt treatment, the expression level of mtcas <dig> increased 25-fold in control plants, whereas in d35s:mtcbf <dig> transgenic plants the expression level increased 40-fold. expression of mtcas <dig> did not differ significantly between the d35s:mtcbf <dig> transgenic and control plants under salt treatment . primers used are listed in additional file  <dig> . overall, the results indicated that over-expression of mtcbf <dig> enhanced tolerance to salt stress and up-regulated the expression of downstream genes in m. truncatula.

discussion
pathway analysis of transcriptomic response to salt stress in m. truncatula
plants produce many secondary metabolites that not only counteract environmental stress, but also aid growth and development  <cit> . it is possible that an increased rate of anthocyanin biosynthesis improves a plant's ability to guard against oxidative damage and protects it from such injury. anthocyanin reportedly functions in the cell membrane as an antioxidant to prevent lipid peroxidation under conditions of stress  <cit> . isoflavonoid reductase is a key enzyme in the isoflavonoid phytoalexin biosynthesis pathway and was first studied in medicago sativa  <cit> . over-expression of an isoflavone reductase-like gene in transgenic rice  reportedly confers resistance to reactive oxygen species  stress  <cit> , which often occurs after ion stress caused by salt stress. isoflavonoids are required for a wide range of essential physiological processes and are valuable secondary phenylpropanoid metabolites found mainly in legumes. over-expression of isoflavone 7-o-methyltransferase reportedly increases disease resistance in m. sativa and is regarded as the entry point of the isoflavone pathway  <cit> . the isoflavone 3'-hydroxylase belongs to the cytochrome p <dig> 81e family in m. truncatula and possesses many biotic defense responses  <cit> . the hydroxylation process depends on cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases, which are critical to the isoflavone pathway  <cit> , and the probe set mtr. <dig> .s1_at, appears to be most similar to cyp81d <dig>  in arabidopsis. a recent study revealed that a flavonoid-deficient root of m. truncatula lost nodulation capacity, while an isoflavone-deficient root remained unaffected  <cit> , indicating that the flavone and isoflavone pathways not only function differently during the nodulation process, but also during the response to salt stress. the mechanisms of the isoflavone biosynthesis pathway have been studied using m. truncatula as a model system, which demonstrated that it has tissue- and stress-specific expression patterns  <cit> ; our findings confirmed its capability to respond to salt stress.

the active metabolism of cofactors and vitamins may help to establish the translation process; the biosynthesis of the secondary metabolites discussed above might help to re-establish the osmotic balance and reduce the threat of ros, and the biodegradation of xenobiotics might help remove injurants generated or introduced by salt stress. plants might require these response mechanisms against abiotic stress to survive. the response of plants to salt stress is very complex; this may be illustrated by the considerably higher number of probe sets up-regulated in signal transduction and ligand-receptor interaction pathways. probe sets involved in protein folding, sorting, and degradation include heat shock proteins. it is worth noting that the probe sets related to cell growth and death processes showed greater up-regulation. many studies have shown that abiotic stresses, such as salt stress, induce programmed cell death and also result in morphological, physiological, and biochemical changes in plants  <cit> .

a novel cbf member from m. truncatula
the dreb subfamily pathway plays an important role in the stress-responsive regulatory network in plants  <cit> . currently, many homologous dreb genes have been identified in a variety of plants, such as arabidopsis, rice, soybean, barley , cotton , tomato , tobacco , and maize , and over-expression of these genes increased the tolerance to abiotic stresses  <cit> . three mtcbfs  have been isolated, which were thought to play an important role in response to cold stress  <cit> . mtcbf <dig> was slightly induced by salt stress in our microarray data, while mtcbf <dig> and mtcbf <dig> showed no significant changes by checking their corresponding homologous probe sets. the novel cbf subfamily member mtcbf <dig>  which encodes a homolog of cbf proteins in m. truncatula, showed the highest change in induced expression under salt stress, and was isolated in this study.

tissue specificity analysis with the medicago truncatula gene expression atlas  <cit>  indicated that mtcbf <dig> showed a relatively higher expression level in the stem, root  and seed coat than in other tissues. mtcbf <dig> showed higher expression in the root and leaf, mtcbf <dig> was expressed more highly in the shoot and stem, and expression of mtcbf <dig> was higher in the nodule and root. expression of mtcbf <dig> in the root and root tip indicated its involvement in the salt stress response, as the root is the first plant organ to perceive external stress in soil.

phylogenetic analysis revealed mtcbf <dig> belonged to the dreb1-type class and was most similar to gmcbf <dig> and gmcbf <dig>  however, the study of gmcbf <dig> and gmcbf <dig> is very limited. the amino acid sequence of the mtcbf <dig> protein also shares relatively high similarity  with arabidopsis atdreb1d/cbf <dig> protein. mtcbf <dig> protein had a conserved ap <dig> dna-binding domain and a c-terminal lwsy motif, as well as the cbf signature sequences xxaxxf). however, the mtcbf <dig> protein contained dsawk instead of dsawr. these features are found in another cbf homolog, namely tobacco acre111b , which also contains dsawk instead of dsawr, indicating that the dsawk might be a functional equivalent of dsawr. mtcbf <dig> is a nuclear-localized protein and also possesses transactivation ability as expected.

some transcription factors could be induced by a single stress, whereas others might be induced by multiple stresses. atcbf <dig> was up-regulated by drought stress and aba  <cit> . a previous study revealed that it was up-regulated by salt stress  <cit> . moreover, transcription of atcbf <dig> was induced under both chilling and cold stress, as indicated by the more sensitive qrt-pcr method  <cit> . thus, atcbf <dig> is induced under aba, drought, cold, and salt stimulation. as another example, the transcription level of gmdreb <dig> was induced by cold, salt, and drought stress, as well as aba treatment in soybeans  <cit> . mtcbf <dig>  which exhibited a similar expression pattern, was also induced by aba, drought, salt, and cold stimulation in our research. mtcbf <dig> might play an important role in response to abiotic stress in m. truncatula. enriched presence of different stress-responsive cis-acting elements in the promoter of mtcbf <dig> explains why mtcbf <dig> was induced by multiple stresses and aba treatment.

mtcbf <dig> improved abiotic stress tolerance by activating downstream genes containing dre elements
researchers have shown that over-expression of dreb transcription factor genes improves stress tolerance  <cit> . over-expression of mtcbf <dig> cdna in transgenic arabidopsis plants also activated some stress-inducible genes such as cor15a, cor15b, kin <dig>  rd <dig>  rd29a, and rd29b under normal growing conditions. among the downstream genes, cor15a, cor15b, kin <dig>  rd29a and rd <dig>  which have a/gccgacnt as the dre core motif in their promoter regions, are atdreb <dig> target genes  <cit>  and showed a higher transcript level in mtcbf <dig> transgenic plants. by contrast, rd29b, which has accgacna/g/c as the dre core motif in its promoter region, belongs to the atdreb2a specific regulon  <cit> , and showed a comparatively lower expression level in the transgenic plants. as no probe sets were found significantly homologous to these downstream stress-inducible genes in arabidopsis, we selected two other putative downstream genes of mtcbf <dig>  namely mtcas <dig> and mtcas <dig>  which also contain dre elements in their promoter region, to check their expression changes in transgenic m. truncatula. expression inducement of mtcas <dig> and mtcas <dig> was also detected in transgenic m. truncatula over-expressing mtcbf <dig>  in our microarray data, expression of mtcas <dig> was also up-regulated, but no homologous probe sets exist for mtcas <dig>  the results were consistent with the transactivation analysis in the yeast system. collectively, these two analyses indicated mtcbf <dig> functions as a transcriptional activator.

CONCLUSIONS
we used high-throughput microarray technology to monitor the expression dynamics in roots of medicago truncatula seedlings in response to salt stress. bioinformatic analysis of the expression data indicated that primary metabolism, including glycolysis, carbon fixation, starch, and sucrose metabolism, were affected most by external salt stress, whereas secondary metabolism pathways, which could help to reduce ros threat and maintain osmotic balance, such as the anthocyanin and isoflavone pathways were induced, indicating an active response and defense mechanism protects the plant against external abiotic stress. in addition, we selected a transcription factor gene, mtcbf <dig>  for function validation. phylogenetic and multiple sequence alignment analysis revealed mtcbf <dig> is a novel member of the cbf transcriptional factor family in m. truncatula. the role in the abiotic stress response of mtcbf <dig> and the activation ability of downstream genes related to the stress response in transgenic arabidopsis and m. truncatula over-expressing mtcbf <dig> indicated mtcbf <dig> is involved in stress tolerance, and is a good candidate gene for genetic improvement to produce stress-tolerant transgenic plants.
