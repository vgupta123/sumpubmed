BACKGROUND
brown algae  are sessile macro-organisms of great ecological relevance in coastal ecosystems, and belong to an evolutionary lineage that has diverged from land plants and other multicellular organisms more than one billion years ago through secondary endosymbiosis  <cit> . most of these seaweeds grow in the intertidal zone where they must face constant abiotic fluctuations, e.g. in temperature, irradiation, and salinity, in relation with the tidal cycle. in addition to these natural constraints, they must deal with pollutants, including heavy metals , resulting from human activities. these pollutants represent a major threat for marine ecosystems, impacting benthic flora and fauna assemblages  <cit> . copper  is a vital micronutrient, essential for all forms of life. it acts as cofactor for many enzymatic systems, and participates in crucial physiological processes including photosynthesis and respiration. however, excessive cu concentrations are harmful for most living organisms. for this reason, free cu is found only in traces in eukaryotic cells, where it is tightly controlled by a set of specific transporters and cytosolic chaperones that deliver it to their respective target proteins or organelles  <cit> . at high concentrations, both cupric and cuprous /cu, e0 = + <dig>  v) ions can participate in redox reactions affecting organisms at the cellular level mainly by three well-established processes:  direct protein inactivation by undesired amino acid-metal interactions due to the affinity of cu for thiol-, imidazole-, and carboxyl- groups;  in presence of superoxide or reducing agents cu can be reduced to cu, which is capable of catalyzing the formation of hydroxyl radicals via the non-enzymatic fenton’s reaction  <cit> ;  displacement of essential cations from specific binding sites. these effects impact a wide range of cellular processes in photosynthetic organisms, interfering for instance with fatty acid and protein metabolism, or inhibiting respiration and nitrogen fixation processes  <cit> . copper affects in particular photosystem electron transfer components, leading to the generation of reactive oxygen species  and peroxidation chain reactions involving membrane lipids  <cit> . for these reasons, this metal has been extensively utilized as antifouling agent to prevent the proliferation of algal flora on immersed surfaces.

most organisms deploy an array of mechanisms to control cellular cu levels, for detoxification, and to repair damaged cellular structures, which are triggered via the activation of signaling pathways. signal transduction involves elements shared by plants and animals, but also molecules specific to each lineage  <cit> . plants may trap free cu by increasing levels of chelating agents such as chaperones, metallothioneins, phytochelatins, or organic acids  <cit> . this process is linked to an increase of transmembrane activity, in which cu p1b-type atpases and multidrug resistance abcc transporters  may have key roles to sequester or exclude chelated forms of cu or other toxic adducts  <cit> .

knowledge of the molecular bases of cu stress regulation in brown algae is still scarce and scattered. previous studies in this domain have focused on a few specific physiological aspects such as photosynthesis  <cit> , oxidative stress  <cit> , or metal chelation  <cit> , and most constitute field studies of long-term adaptation to chronic cu exposure. recently, two publications have reported large-scale proteomic analyses to identify mechanisms underlying acclimation to high cu levels  <cit> . these studies showed the increase of brown algal specific antioxidant mechanisms and changes in photosynthesis-related proteins to cope with chronic cu stress. however, there is still limited molecular data, especially at the transcriptomic level, on how brown algae sense short-term variations in metal content and induce the regulation of intracellular cu concentrations through specific signaling processes. previous work on the brown alga laminaria digitata showed that short term exposure to cu stress triggers the synthesis of 12-oxophytodienoic acid  and prostaglandins, concomitantly with changes in expression of selected genes involved in stress response  <cit> . these results suggest that brown algae may synthesize plant-like octadecanoid, but also eicosanoid oxylipins, to induce stress-related detoxification responses.

so far, global molecular analyses of the brown algal stress response were hampered by the lack of genomic resources. the development of the biological model ectocarpus siliculosus, including access to its genome sequence, represents a major breakthrough in algal research, and opens the gates to “omics”-based approaches  <cit> . regarding cu-homeostasis, the annotation of the e. siliculosus genome allowed identifying several putative cu-chaperones, abc transporters, and cu-channels controlling cellular cu traffic. moreover, two recent reports by dittami et al. <cit>  have established a starting point for the integrated analysis of transcript and metabolite profiling during the short-term response to saline and oxidative stress in e. siliculosus. they demonstrated the repression of primary metabolism and the activation of recycling of existing proteins through autophagy under the abiotic stress conditions tested.

in the present study, we employed large-scale transcriptome and metabolome analyses to gain insights into the short-term acclimation of e. siliculosus to cu stress, and extended the analysis of gene expression data to results previously published for other abiotic stressors. the integration of these results highlighted the cu induction of a large panel of signaling mechanisms likely to constitute the driving force behind the observed transcriptomic and metabolic shifts. in particular, oxylipin metabolism and several distinct genes coding for transcription-associated proteins were up-regulated. moreover, transcriptomic meta-analysis of cu and other abiotic stressors showed tight links between cu and oxidative stress, and confirmed previous observations such as the repression of genes encoding enzymes involved in primary amino acid biosynthesis, balanced with the induction of autophagic processes. in addition, this analysis allowed the identification of cu stress specific mechanisms such as the up-regulation of multidrug resistance abc transporters, putative cu p1b-type atpases, and of a vanadium bromoperoxidase involved in halide metabolism.

RESULTS
cu stress treatments alter photosynthetic capabilities of e. siliculosus
to monitor the short-term acclimation to stress rather than cell death, the intensity of cu stress had to be carefully selected. in previous chronic cu stress experiments, we showed that cu at a concentration of 250 μg l- <dig> led to a drastic decrease of photosynthetic activity  after  <dig> to 6 days of treatment  <cit> . in this study, we aimed to monitor the acute cu stress response of e. siliculosus. therefore algae were incubated in presence of cu during 8 h at final concentrations of 250 μg l- <dig> and at 500 μg l- <dig>  these concentrations are comparable to those registered in cu polluted marine sites where e. siliculosus has been observed  <cit> , and correspond to an approximately 400-fold enrichment of the total dissolved cu content in the natural seawater used to set-up the experiments. changes in the photosynthetic yield were then followed on an hourly basis. compared to the control treatment, algae incubated with 500 μg l- <dig> displayed significantly lower fv/fm ratios after 6 h , while 250 μg l- <dig> induced a significant decrease  only after 8 h of treatment . taking these results into consideration, algae were sampled after 4 h and 8 h of incubation in medium with 250 μg l- <dig> cu to monitor molecular changes occurring prior and during the observed reduction of photosynthetic activity.

meta-transcriptomic analysis highlights copper specific genes, shared responses with oxidative stress treatments, and core abiotic stress genes
copper stress treatment resulted in  <dig> significantly regulated contigs/singletons under cu stress ,  <dig> of which were up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated compared to control conditions . none of the examined contigs/singletons showed a significant interaction between time and treatment, indicating little difference in the transcriptomic response to 4 h and 8 h of cu treatment. only 11% of the contigs/singletons induced in response to cu stress were automatically classified by the golem and kobas annotation tools ; therefore manual classification was done for genes presenting a fold-change ratio >  <dig> compared to the control conditions. this dataset represents  <dig> genes , which were assigned to  <dig> categories .

cu stress transcriptomic data were further compared to previous results obtained with the same array and protocol for short-term  hyposaline , hypersaline  and oxidative  stress  <cit>  . to reduce the number of false negatives no fdr correction was applied for this meta-analysis, and all transcripts previously found to be significantly regulated  after either 6 h  <cit>  or  <dig> or 8 h  were taken into account. seventy-five contigs/singletons were up-regulated in all considered stress conditions . seventy-six percent of them  code for proteins with unknown functions, and 48%  are orphans , that is as of march  <dig>  they had no match outside e. siliculosus in the ncbi nr database at an e-value cutoff of 1e- <dig>  regarding down-regulated transcripts, we identified  <dig> contigs/singletons  of which 55%  correspond to unknown proteins and 27%  are orphans.

hierarchical clustering  revealed that h2o <dig> stress samples formed a cluster with cu-stress samples, likely reflecting the fact that cu treatment unbalances the cellular redox state, leading to oxidative stress. indeed, 42% of the contigs/singletons regulated  in response to copper stress were also regulated at least in response to h2o <dig> . in the following sections, we focus on the manual analysis of selected gene families or functional categories of genes representing three profiles of expression: genes regulated by all available stressors, genes regulated at least by cu and h2o <dig>  and finally genes specifically regulated by copper stress. lists of these genes as well as available annotations are provided in additional file  <dig>  gene set enrichment analyses were performed for these three different groups of genes using blast2go, but did not yield any significantly overrepresented go terms at an fdr < 5%.

cell signaling and communication
a phospholipase c  gene  was up-regulated specifically under cu stress. the locus esi0085_ <dig>  encoding a calcium-dependent phospholipid binding protein of the copine family that is related to abiotic stress processes in land plants, was induced under both cu and h2o <dig> stress. in addition, a gene encoding a ca-dependent protein kinase  and a serine threonine kinase  were up-regulated by both stressors. conversely, a large set of genes involved in myo-inositol metabolism were down-regulated under these treatments. this was true for a cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol  synthase , a putative phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate  5-kinase , a myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase , a phosphatidylinositol transfer protein sec <dig> , and a putative inositol monophosphatase .

in relation to downstream lipid metabolism and signaling cascades, a gene encoding a cytochrome p <dig> enzyme  was among the most highly up-regulated genes during copper treatment  and also responded to oxidative stress . the corresponding protein displays approximately 30% identity and 45% similarity with the cytochrome p <dig> domain of plant allene oxide synthases  of the cyp <dig> family involved in the jasmonate biosynthetic pathway. a multiple alignment of this protein with members of the cyp <dig> family highlights the existence of several motifs common to aoss, such as the ihcd motif and the conserved f and s catalytic amino acid residues . finally, protein structure homology modelling using the phyre <dig> software predicts high structural similarity between esi0060_ <dig> and the aos of parthenium argentatum .

transcription factors 
among the  <dig> tfs in the e. siliculosus genome  <cit> , our study identified  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes . eight of these genes were specifically up-regulated by cu stress, whereas seven others were co-induced by cu and h2o <dig>  among them, two potential arsenite-inducible an1-zfps, esi0002_ <dig> , and esi0348_ <dig>  were found. interestingly, esi0002_ <dig> was more similar to animal an1-zfps, and esi0348_ <dig> to plant-type stress associated proteins. also in relation to stress tfs, the heat shock factor esi0279_ <dig> was among the genes most strongly repressed in response to cu stress, with a 26-fold change after 4 h of treatment . furthermore, two cu specifically up-regulated genes, esi0100_ <dig> and esi0226_ <dig>  contained the rwp-rk domain found in plant proteins involved in nitrogen-controlled development  <cit> . finally, we recorded the transcriptional up-regulation of a gene coding for a protein containing a zinc finger domain that was initially annotated as a metal responsive transcription factor -1-like protein  under both cu and oxidative stress. however, although this protein showed some similarities to the dna binding domain of metazoan mtf- <dig>  no further homology to mtf- <dig> proteins was observed outside this domain, making it impossible to infer the function of esi0513_ <dig> without further experimentation.

log2-ratios represent the means of three biological replicates. in the column “meta-analysis”, cu is for copper stress, oxi for oxidative stress, hyper for hypersaline stress, and hypo for hyposaline stress condition. the direction of the changes under these different treatments is indicated by up and down for induction or repression, respectively.

stress and detoxification mechanisms
many genes coding for proteins involved in general stress and detoxification mechanisms were regulated under both cu and h2o <dig> stress. for instance, eight heat shock proteins  of the  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> classes were up-regulated, possibly to facilitate the refolding of damaged proteins and to prevent protein aggregation  under acute oxidative stress. the up-regulation of a dna double-strand break repair rad <dig> atpase  was also observed. finally, genes coding for proteins with important functions for antioxidant mechanisms were also induced by cu and h2o <dig>  including a glutathione reductase , two glutathione-s-transferases , and one thioredoxin .

besides the overlapping responses to h2o <dig> and cu treatments, several genes regulated exclusively by cu stress were identified, including two chloroplastic iron-dependant superoxide dismutases  and a vanadium dependent bromoperoxidase  which is a ros detoxifying enzyme specific of brown algae . furthermore, a glutathione-s-transferase , and two glutaredoxins, esi0050_ <dig>  and esi0036_ <dig>  were also specifically up-regulated by cu. these latter enzymes are likely involved in hm-detoxification functions such as reduction of cu-glutathione adducts and export of cu-organic acid adducts. several additional stress-related transport systems were specifically up-regulated by cu stress. among them were a multidrug and toxic compound extrusion protein  and a putative heavy metal p1b-type atpase  . this protein contains a conserved hma motif in the n-terminal cytoplasmic region, a central e1-e <dig> atpase domain, and a haloacid dehalogenase domain in the c-terminal region ; psi-blast shows 41% of identity between the e. siliculosus protein and the a. thaliana cu+ exporting p1b type atpase hma <dig> .

we also observed cu specific up-regulation of five of the  <dig> putative e. siliculosus abc transporter proteins  . phylogenetic analysis, together with reference sequences from the human  <cit>  and a. thaliana <cit>  superfamily of abcts, led to the classification of these five e. siliculosus proteins into four abct subfamilies . of particular interest are esi0109_ <dig> and esi077_ <dig>  which fall into the stress-detoxification abc-b  and abc-c  subfamilies, respectively. in addition, esi0359_ <dig> and esi0154_ <dig> clustered with plant and human abc-a transporters.

primary metabolism and protein turnover
as illustrated by our pam measurements, one basic process altered by copper stress was photosynthesis, which is directly linked to the generation of ros when intracellular copper concentrations are not properly regulated. in our study, two genes coding for stress-related chlorophyll binding proteins  of the li <dig> family, esi0002_ <dig> and esi0085_ <dig>  appeared up-regulated specifically by cu stress, and a third, esi0085_ <dig>  was up-regulated under copper, oxidative, and hyposaline stress. a fourth cu-induced cbp, esi0458_ <dig>  belonged to the lhcf clade  <cit> . we also observed a trend for down-regulation, at least under cu stress, of a number of genes related to the xanthophyll cycle such as putative violaxanthin de-epoxidases, as well as a putative zeaxanthin epoxidase . regarding chlorophyll biosynthesis, cu and h2o <dig> repressed genes encoding an mg chelatase, a chlorophyll synthase, and a protoporphyrinogen oxidase. although these changes did not pass our rather strict fdr correction, they were significant when analysed individually .

twenty of the genes repressed by cu stress were associated to nitrogen assimilation and primary amino acid synthesis . several of them were also down-regulated under h2o <dig> stress, such as one nitrite reductase h and ferredoxin; esi0249_0028), one glutamate synthase , one glutamate dehydrogenase  <dig> , and three putative nh4+ and no3- transporters  . these observations suggest the repression of the gs/gogat pathway under oxidative stress conditions. in addition, an agmatinase , and a spermine synthase  were specifically down-regulated by cu, indicating the repression of the arginine/ornithine-derived polyamine pathway. three other genes, coding for proteins involved in nitrate, ammonium, urea and amino acid transport , were down-regulated in all stress conditions included in our meta-analysis.

in contrast to the transcriptomic repression of nitrogen assimilation,  <dig> contigs/singletons related to protein turnover processes  were induced in response to copper stress. among them,  <dig> genes correspond to the ubiquitin system, and all of them except one encoding an ubiquitin related protein esi0009_ <dig> were induced in response to several stressors . eight genes corresponded to proteasome-related proteins, suggesting the induction of stress-related autophagy mechanisms. four of these genes were induced specifically in response to copper. furthermore, we detected the up-regulation of six ring type domain proteins that might correspond to e3-ligases .

parallel to changes in n metabolism, we observed down-regulation of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis and degradation. moreover, twenty-one genes related to sugar metabolism were significantly regulated in response to cu treatments . most of them correspond to proteins involved in central carbon metabolism and storage, sugar transport, and structural modifications of cell wall polysaccharides, and were also regulated in response to other stressors . regarding sugar metabolism, it is interesting to note the presence of genes involved in mannitol and trehalose synthesis, both repressed in presence of cu . with respect to cell wall structure modifications, we noted that cu and h2o <dig> treatments induced the up-regulation of two genes encoding the alginate modifying enzymes mannuronan-c5-epimerases mep <dig> and mep <dig> . a number of loci corresponding to other polysaccharide modifying enzymes were also induced in presence of copper, mainly after 4 h of treatment, such as several loci encoding glycoside hydrolases  and glycoside transferases  . however, none of these cu-regulated gts or ghs was induced in presence of h2o <dig> 

cu-induced changes at the transcriptome level modulate metabolite composition
to relate the transcriptional reprogramming induced by copper stress in e. siliculosus with changes in the metabolome, metabolite profiling was carried out for algal samples harvested after 4 h and 8 h of treatments. uplc-ms experiments in positive ion mode for cu-stressed algae provided  <dig> monoisotopic peaks. partial least squares discriminant analysis  and hierarchical clustering  of these compounds indicated a clear distinction between cu stress and control samples, but the different treatment times could not be separated. two major groups of metabolites emerged from this analysis, corresponding to compounds that either accumulate or decline in response to cu stress. within each of these groups two smaller clusters, with either a strong or a weak response to stress, were visible. the combination of uplc-ms and gc-ms analysis allowed us to identify  <dig> compounds corresponding to fatty acids, oxylipins, and amino acids .

changes in amino acid contents
in agreement with our results obtained for the global metabolite profiles, pls-da of samples according to their amino acid profile allowed to discriminate between control and stress conditions , as well as between durations of treatments. the primary amino acids in e. siliculosus, alanine and glutamate  <cit>  showed no significant variations in response to stress . in contrast, contents of aromatic  and branched chain amino acids  increased at least  <dig> fold after 4 h and 8 h of cu treatment , likely as a result of increased protein catabolism.

variations in free fatty acid contents and oxylipin synthesis
cu stress induced a significant increase in the levels of free fatty acids , especially after 8 h of treatment  . in accordance with this analysis, the pls co-projection of ffa variations discriminated treatments  and exposure time  .

regarding ffas, cu treatment induced a 3-fold increase of linolenic acid , arachidonic acid , and eicosapentaenoic acid  . this increase was correlated with the occurrence of octadecanoid and eicosanoid oxygenated derivatives but only after 8 h of stress and in three of the four biological replicates analyzed. currently, we do not have any explanation why these observations did not hold true for the fourth biological replicate, which much resembled the other replicates of the same condition with respect to all other examined metabolites as well as gene expression profiles. in the three replicates mentioned above, 13-hydroxy-9z,11e-octadecadienoic acid  and 13s-hydroxy-9z,11e,15z-octadecatrienoic acid  contents increased under the 8 h stress treatment, with 16- and 3-fold changes respectively, suggesting the occurrence of a 13-lipoxygenase activity . within the same context, the content of 12-oxophytodienoic acid  increased 3-fold after 8 h of cu treatment and the non-enzymatic accumulation of cyclic c <dig> phytoprostanes a <dig> was triggered, supporting the occurrence of ros-mediated lipid peroxidation processes. finally, cu stress induced the accumulation of c20: <dig> derivatives such as oxo-6e,8z,11z,14z-eicosatetraenoic acid , together with the cyclopentenones prostaglandin a <dig> and j <dig> .

finally, it is worth mentioning that among the  <dig> monoisotopic peaks from ions detected through uplc-ms analysis, many unknown metabolites were regulated by exposure to cu . the analysis of these compounds was beyond the scope of this report, but their identity and function will be the subject of future studies.

discussion
copper is extremely toxic at high concentrations, and induces oxidative stress by altering electron transfer reactions such as photosynthesis and respiration. in our study, we observed a range of different acclimation processes on the molecular level  before the alga exhibited a decrease in photosynthetic yield. such a decrease in photosynthetic yield results in the alteration of several physiological processes in e. siliculosus, such as the formation of heavy metal-substituted chlorophylls  <cit> , reduced carbon fixation and depletion of reducing equivalents. effectively, since nitrate reduction directly relies on nadh and fadh <dig> produced by photosynthesis  <cit> , any condition altering photosynthesis  may directly affect the regulation of n assimilation and the associated primary amino acid metabolism  <cit>  or vice versa. we observed that cu-stressed e. siliculosus down-regulated genes coding for enzymes related to n assimilation. this down-regulation was not related to a decrease of the pool of free primary amino acids. moreover, an increase in the content of aromatic amino acids was recorded together with an induction of genes encoding proteins involved in the autophagy process, in particular those related to ubiquitination such as putative e <dig> ubiquitin ligases, and proteins involved in the proteasome complexes. these observations are similar to previous results published in e. siliculosus on response to other stress conditions  <cit> , and suggest that alteration of n assimilation and carbon fixation is compensated by degradation of damaged proteins and recycling of amino acids. similar processes have been identified in land plants during stress response or in diatoms under nitrogen starvation  <cit> . concomitantly to the down-regulation of genes involved in n assimilation under copper stress, we observed an increase of free fatty acids. similar links between amino- and fatty acid metabolism have previously been observed in other algae, such as chlamydomonas reinhardtii <cit> . altogether, these data suggest that a substantial part of the response of e. siliculosus to short term copper stress consists in balancing primary metabolic processes. although we can currently only speculate about the exact physiological benefits of each of the observed adjustments, two important functions may be  the compensation for stress-induced changes in photosynthesis and  the reduction of the energetic budget for nitrogen assimilation. these changes in primary metabolic processes are undoubtedly tightly tied to the specific stress responses and signaling mechanisms discussed below.

much of the shared cu and h2o <dig> response consisted in genes related to signal transduction and ros scavenging. this result points out that the cu-induced ros formation activates a large set of stress acclimation mechanisms. apart from the overlapping response, several genes were regulated exclusively under cu stress, suggesting that this heavy metal may induce the production of ross different from those produced under h2o <dig> stress, such as o2- or •ho. in relation to signal transduction, we detected down-regulation of several e. siliculosus genes encoding enzymes involved in myo-inositol  metabolism, a conserved process in plants and metazoans  <cit> . recent studies in arabidopsis have demonstrated the importance of mi in oxidative and phytohormone-related stress responses. using catalase-deficient a. thaliana mutant plants, chaouch and noctor  <cit>  observed that mi abolished salicylic acid-dependent cell death and pathogen defense responses triggered by peroxisomal h2o <dig>  as mentioned by meng et al. <cit>  and donahue et al. <cit> , a connection has been previously observed between mi synthesis and cell death by studying l-myo-inositol 1-phosphate synthase mutants. while our data indicates that a similar link between oxidative stress and the mi pathway may exist in e. siliculosus, it remains to be assessed whether the underlying functions or regulatory mechanisms are the same as those found in a. thaliana. besides the direct signaling functions of mi, multi-phosphorylated forms of inositol such as ip <dig> or ip <dig> are key cofactors of the plant auxin  and jasmonate  ubiquitin ligase receptor complexes, therefore playing fundamental roles in phytohormone perception  <cit> . methyl-jasmonate  was detected in our experiments, but its contents did not change significantly  under the tested conditions. previous studies have shown that exogenous treatments with meja activate defensive mechanisms in several brown algae  <cit> . the synthetic pathway of meja has not yet been functionally characterized in brown algae and, moreover, the e. siliculosus genome contains neither homologs of land plant ja receptors nor components of the core transcriptional regulatory complex such as mycs, jazs, ninja and coi <dig>  <cit> . this suggests that this molecule may not exert the same functions in brown algae as in land plants or that this compound has evolved to serve similar functions but using different regulatory systems. however, 8 h of cu-stress triggered the accumulation of c <dig> plant-like cyclic oxylipins such as 12-opda, ppa <dig> and ppa <dig>  together with c20: <dig> cyclic prostaglandins such as pga <dig> and pgj <dig> in e. siliculosus, and this is in agreement with previous observations made in the kelp l. digitata <cit> . in other organisms these compounds are derived from enzymatic  or non-enzymatic  processes. all of these fatty acids derivatives contain α,β-unsaturated carbonyl groups and belong to the group of reactive electrophilic species  <cit> . in land plants, previous studies have demonstrated that 12-opda and phytoprostanes play important roles in environmental stress and pathogenesis, acting independently of meja, by activating general detoxification and stress responses including hsps and abc transporters  <cit> . in this sense, one of the most highly up-regulated genes under copper treatment featuring some sequence similarity with members of the cytochrome p <dig> cyp <dig> family is an interesting candidate for aos activity in e. siliculosus, but further experiments will be required to determine the function of this protein with certainty. in our study, we also observed changes in the expression of genes similar to those regulated by res in land plants. it is therefore reasonable to speculate about  conserved physiological roles of these oxylipins in e. siliculosus. detailed transcriptomic experiments using each of these compounds as elicitor must be carried out to test these hypotheses. however, the increase of octadecanoid and eicosanoid oxygenated fatty acid derivatives suggest that brown algae may use plant-like octadecanoid signals and animal-like eicosanoid oxylipins, which are absent in vascular plants, to regulate protective mechanisms or stress responses.

metal transport is a key process in the interaction of algae with their environments  <cit> , and cu treatment induced several potential membrane transport mechanisms in e. siliculosus. of special interest was the up-regulation of a putative ortholog of a. thaliana cu2+ p1b-type atpases. such proteins play an important role in cu compartmentalization and excretion in plant roots, and corresponding mutants in a. thaliana are cu-hypersensitive  <cit> . in the same vein, five abc transporters were up-regulated in response to cu stress, two of which belong to the b and c sub-families known to participate in the transport of xenobiotics, and of glutathione or phytochelatin conjugates in land plants and animals  <cit> . additionally, members of the sub-family c, such as the human mrp <dig>  have been shown to act as transporter of eicosanoids such as leukotrienes  <cit> , suggesting a possible link between the concomitant induction of an mrp homolog in e. siliculosus and of c <dig> oxylipin production in our study. furthermore, several putative transporters of the sub-family a are regulated under cu stress in e. siliculosus and might be involved in lipid trafficking processes in regard to the function of these proteins in land plants and mammals  <cit> . detoxification transporters of the mate family and grx/malate fusion proteins also seem to play a role in cu-detoxification in e. siliculosus. in rice, mates are involved in aluminium  resistance by secreting al-citrate conjugates  <cit> . assuming similar functions in e. siliculosus, our observation would suggest that the up-regulation of genes encoding these transporters is related to the secretion of cu-conjugates, and thus that some processes involved in cu detoxification are conserved across very distant lineages. in contrast, among the mechanisms that seem to be specific to brown algae, one is based on halide metabolism. the e. siliculosus genome contains only one gene coding for a putative vbpo, and this gene was up-regulated under cu stress. the accumulation of this vbpo protein and an increase in the corresponding enzyme activity in both a copper-tolerant and a copper-sensitive strain of e. siliculosus  in response to chronic cu stress conditions have previously been reported  <cit> , supporting the potential role of this enzyme in specific brown algal ros detoxification processes.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides an overview of copper stress acclimation in e. siliculosus, and highlights a number of processes that seem to be conserved with metazoans or land plants. of interest for future brown algal research is the potential cross-talk between ros, mi, and oxylipin signaling. considering that two thirds of the regulated genes identified through this work encode proteins of unknown function, many additional components of the stress response remain to be discovered. the number of available medium to high throughput datasets related to stress response in brown algae is still limited  <cit> , and the analysis of such results paves the way to decipher some of the molecular mechanisms leading to acclimation of these organisms to their frequently changing environment. they will be complemented by follow-up studies benefiting from the development of new techniques and protocols for brown algae, such as reverse genetics  or the assessment of nucleic acid-protein and protein-protein interactions.
