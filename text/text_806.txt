BACKGROUND
more than  <dig> years have passed since robert koch discovered that the bacterium mycobacterium tuberculosis was the causative agent of tuberculosis. since then enormous efforts have been undertaken to combat this disease. despite of a number of achievements, m. tuberculosis still kills more people worldwide than any other bacterium, and the mechanisms transforming m. tuberculosis to the most successful bacterial pathogen are still not well understood. m. tuberculosis is able to multiply inside macrophages and to persist for decades in a latent state in the human host without being eliminated by the immune system. our research aims at finding bacterial factors influencing intracellular survival and latency. since the mdp <dig> gene  has been associated with the induction of a dormant state of mycobacteria  <cit> , we decided to investigate the influence of mdp <dig> on in vitro growth, intracellular survival, antibiotic susceptibility and gene regulation.

mdp <dig> from m. bovis was first described in  <dig>  <cit>  and belongs to a group of orthologous dna-binding proteins  also present in other mycobacteria like m. tuberculosis, m. kansasii, m. avium, m. fortuitum, m. marinum, m. leprae, m. ulcerans or m. smegmatis  <cit> . mdp <dig> is composed of  <dig> amino acids, has a calculated molecular weight of  <dig> kda and an isoelectric point of  <dig> . the protein is rich in alanine, arginine, lysine, proline and threonine. mdp <dig> has partial homology with eukaryotic histone h <dig> and escherichia coli hu protein, pointing to a possible role in dna packaging and transcriptional regulation.

the mdp <dig> gene from m. bovis bcg is a single copy gene located between the genes leud  and mutt <dig> . the genome of m. bovis bcg carries three other genes with low similarity to the c-terminal region of mdp <dig>  encoding the 50s ribosomal protein l <dig>  the heparin binding hemagglutinin  and the histone-like protein hns. the hlp proteins from other slow-growing mycobacteria display 95% , 84% , 81%  and 77%  identical base pairs. the variations in the nucleotide sequences of the hlp genes from different mycobacterial species have been utilized for the establishment of specific pcr assays for diagnostic purposes  <cit> .

it has recently been suggested that mdp <dig> was involved in growth regulation by controlling glycolipid biosynthesis and cell wall biogenesis  <cit> . mdp <dig> is a very abundant protein constituting 8–10% of the total protein. the mdp <dig> gene is up-regulated in stationary phase  <cit> . a correlation between the regulation of the mdp <dig> gene and the iron availability has recently been demonstrated. the protein irep- <dig> , which corresponds to the dna-binding protein from m. tuberculosis, was shown to be up-regulated under low-iron conditions  <cit> . the mdp <dig> protein could be localized in the nucleoid, at the 50s ribosomal subunits and on the cell surface  <cit> . the surface localization of mdp <dig> and its capacity to bind hyaluronic acids, heparin and chondroitin sulphate imply a possible function as adhesion molecule facilitating entry into epithelial cells  <cit> . the protein ml-lbp <dig> from m. leprae, which is orthologous to mdp <dig>  has been shown to be involved in the attachment to and invasion of schwann cells  <cit> .

the mdp <dig> gene from m. bovis bcg and the orthologous genes from m. smegmatis and m. leprae were mutated and the effects of the mutations on growth and adhesion were analyzed. unexpectedly, the hlp mutant from m. smegmatis had the same generation time as the wild type and the mutation did not affect the viability of dormant cultures  <cit> . similarly, the mutation of the mdp <dig> gene from m. bovis bcg did not affect the growth rate  <cit> . analogous to these results, the capacity of m. leprae to bind to schwann cells was not decreased after mutation of the hlp gene  <cit> . these results indicate that either the functions of the hlp genes are different from those assumed or that other genes replace the function of the hlp genes in the mutants.

taking these results into account, we decided to use an alternative approach for the analysis of possible functions of mdp <dig> from m. bovis bcg. here we describe the construction of a m. bovis bcg strain carrying a mdp1-antisense plasmid and the influence of the antisense construct on the growth of m. bovis bcg under various growth conditions.

methods
study design
we analysed the influence of the mdp <dig> protein on the growth characteristics of m. bovis bcg by reducing its expression in m. bovis bcg by means of a mdp1-antisense plasmid . two independent transformants containing the antisense construct  were generated to be able to rule out effects caused by second-line mutations. the empty cloning vector pmv <dig> was also introduced into m. bovis bcg, and the transformant bcg served as reference strain. the degree of mdp <dig> reduction in bcg was determined by elisa. the characterisation of the phenotype of bcg in comparison to bcg comprised the determination of the growth rate in broth as well as in macrophages, the description of the degree of aggregate formation, the measurement of the susceptibility towards certain antibiotics and the analysis of proteomes of bacteria cultivated in different atmospheric oxygen concentrations.

construction of a m. bovis bcg derivative containing the mdp1-antisense plasmid pas-mdp1
we amplified a  <dig> bp fragment of bcg-dna, covering the first  <dig> bp of the coding sequence from the mdp <dig> gene and  <dig> bp of the untranslated upstream region containing the shine-dalgarno sequence. blast analyses with the sequence of the amplified fragment supplied evidence that this fragment has only negligible homology to other genes from bcg such that the probability of unspecific binding of the antisense fragment in bcg was extremely low. the pcr primers used  were provided with restriction sites for the restriction enzymes hindiii  or psti  to allow insertion of the amplified dna into the hindiii/psti-digested vector pmv <dig>  this procedure resulted in an insertion of the beginning of the mdp <dig> gene in antisense orientation with respect to the hsp <dig> promoter . sequencing of the insert of the recombinant plasmid pas-mdp <dig> confirmed the antisense orientation and the absence of mismatches. the plasmid pas-mdp <dig> as well as the empty vector pmv <dig> were introduced into m. bovis bcg copenhagen by electroporation. experimental proof of transformation of the plasmids in bcg was achieved by pcr using the primers tn903/s <dig> and tn903/as <dig>  and the primers mdas <dig> and pmv261fw . expression of the antisense-rna was proven by rt-pcr.

the cultivation of mycobacterium bovis bcg copenhagen and escherichia coli strain dh5α has been described before  <cit> . media for growth of m. bovis bcg containing the plasmid pmv <dig> or pas-mdp <dig> were supplemented with  <dig> to  <dig> μg kanamycin ml- <dig>  plasmid pmv <dig> is an e. coli/mycobacterium shuttle vector containing the tn903-derived aph gene that confers kanamycin resistance as a selectable marker and the promoter from the hsp <dig> gene for expression of integrated genes  <cit> . the mouse macrophage cell line j774a. <dig>  and the human monocyte cell line mono-mac- <dig>  were maintained in rpmi medium with 10% fcs.

dna and rna manipulations
molecular biology techniques were carried out according to standard protocols  <cit>  or according to the recommendations of the manufacturers of kits and enzymes. pcr was performed with the pcr kit from mbi fermentas. oligonucleotide primers were purchased from metabion. restriction enzymes were obtained from mbi fermentas and biolabs. we used the qiaquick® gel extraction kit  to elute dna fragments from agarose gels. purification of dna samples to remove enzymes, nucleotides or salts was achieved either by phenol/chloroform extraction followed by alcohol precipitation or by using the qiaquick® pcr purification kit . ligation reactions were carried out with the t4-dna-ligase from biolabs or mbi fermentas. transformation of e. coli was performed according to the method by hanahan  <cit> . m. bovis bcg was transformed by electroporation as previously described  <cit> . plasmids were isolated from e. coli with the qiagen® plasmid maxi kit  or with the nucleospin® plasmid kit from machery-nagel. sequencing reactions were carried out by using the prism big dye™ fs terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit from pe applied biosystems. qiazol  was used to extract rna from mycobacterial cultures. rt-pcr was performed with the access rt-pcr system from promega.

protein isolation
proteins from mycobacterial broth cultures were prepared according to the method of florczyk et al.  <cit>  with modifications. ten ml of bacterial cultures were sedimented and the pellets were washed three times with cold dpbs  containing  <dig> % edta. after addition of  <dig> μg ml- <dig> of proteinase inhibitor cocktail  the cells were heated for  <dig> min at 80°c and centrifuged. the pellets were resuspended in  <dig> μl tris-sds buffer  and the cells were disrupted in the cell disruptor precellys  <dig>  by shaking them twice at  <dig> rpm for  <dig> sec with a pause of  <dig> sec. the lysates were briefly centrifuged and sds  and β-mercaptoethanol  were added. the lysates were then incubated for  <dig> min at 37°c. the proteins were precipitated with acetone and resuspended in  <dig> to  <dig> μl tris-sds buffer. the protein concentration was determined with the bca protein assay .

mdp <dig> elisa
detection and quantification of mdp <dig> in protein preparations from broth cultures from m. bovis bcg and m. bovis bcg was achieved by elisa, using a rabbit antiserum directed against the peptide  <dig> to  <dig>  from mdp <dig> . the peptide and antiserum were purchased from biogenes gmbh. beforehand the specificity of the antibody was confirmed by western blotting using the bm chemiluminescence western blotting kit . for western blotting, the mdp <dig> antiserum was diluted 1: <dig>  the luminescence signal was recorded with the chemiluminescence imager chemiesmart  <dig> .

the proteins isolated from the broth cultures were diluted in  <dig> mm nahco <dig>  ph  <dig> , and  <dig> μl of selected dilutions were given into the wells of nunc-immuno™ maxisorp microtiter plates  and incubated at 4°c over night. the wells were then washed twice with tbs-t . blocking of unspecific binding sites was achieved by incubation with  <dig> % casein in pbs for one hour at 37°c followed by five washes with tbs-t. then,  <dig> μl of a 1: <dig> dilution of the mdp <dig> antiserum or of pre-immune serum in tbs were added to the wells and incubated for  <dig> min at room temperature. after five washes with tbs-t  <dig>  μg of the second antibody  was given into the wells and incubated for  <dig> min. the plate was washed again five times with tbs-t, and  <dig> μl sureblue™ tmb microwell peroxidase substrate  were added. the colour reaction was stopped by addition of  <dig> μl  <dig> m hcl and the absorption at  <dig> nm was measured with the spectra fluor .

two-dimensional protein gels
about  <dig> μg of precipitated protein were resuspended and rehydrated in  <dig> μl rehydration buffer  for six hours. the rehydrated samples were transferred into strip holders together with ipg strips ph 3– <dig> nl ,  <dig> cm . the strips were covered with  <dig> μl cover fluid and focused on an ettan ipgphor ii unit  according to the manufacturer's instructions. in the second dimension, the proteins were separated in a vertical  <dig> % sds-polyacrylamide gel using the ettan daltsix electrophoresis unit . the gels were silver-stained according to the protocol by blum et al.  <cit> .

growth experiments in broth culture
comparison of the growth rates of m. bovis bcg and m. bovis bcg was carried out by inoculating middlebrook 7h <dig> medium containing  <dig> μg ml- <dig> kanamycin to obtain an initial optical density   of  <dig>  to  <dig>  and measuring the ods of the cultures at least twice per week. growth of the strains was monitored by quantification of the atp content of the cultures with the luminescence-based kit bactiter-glo™ microbial cell viability assay . the luminescence was reported as relative light units  with the microplate luminometer lb96v .

the stability of mycobacterial aggregates in broth was examined by sonication in the sonifier cell disruptor w- <dig>  at  <dig> watt with 50% pulse duration  for two to  <dig> minutes, followed by plating of appropriate dilutions on mycobacteria 7h <dig> agar.

growth of the bacteria under microaerobic  or anaerobic  conditions was achieved by cultivation in the genbox system from biomérieux.

cell culture experiments
infection of the macrophage cell line j774a. <dig> with m. bovis bcg strains was performed according to the protocol described previously  <cit> . a total of  <dig> ×  <dig> cells of j774a. <dig> per well were infected at a multiplicity of infection  of five for four hours with m. bovis bcg or m. bovis bcg grown to od  <dig>  .

the mm <dig> cells growing non-adherently were initially infected in  <dig> cm <dig> cell culture flasks .  <dig> ×  <dig> mm <dig> cells in  <dig> ml of rpmi medium were infected at a moi of  <dig> for four hours with cultures of the m. bovis bcg strains grown to od  <dig>  . the cells were then washed twice with  <dig> ml of rpmi and treated with amikacin  for two hours. after amikacin treatment the infected mm <dig> were washed again, resuspended in rpmi medium with  <dig> μg ml- <dig> of amikacin, counted and distributed into 24-well plates .

the extraction of dna from the cell lysates was performed as described before  <cit> . quantification of intracellularly grown bcg by real-time pcr was achieved by amplification of a region of the 85b antigen gene, using the primers my85fw and my85bw  <cit>   together with the fam/tamra-labelled probe my85bprobe  <cit>   as described  <cit> . the amount of dna was determined by means of a standard established with known amounts of genomic dna from m. bovis bcg.

RESULTS
the antisense plasmid pas-mdp <dig> reduces the expression of mdp <dig> in m. bovis bcg by about 50%
after electroporation of the plasmid pas-mdp <dig> and the vector pmv <dig> into m. bovis bcg, we analyzed the impact of the antisense construct on the expression of mdp <dig> by elisa using a mdp1-specific peptide antibody. the specificity of the antibody had first been confirmed by western blotting. the western blot was performed with a protein preparation from m. bovis bcg using either the mdp <dig> antiserum or the corresponding pre-immune serum. as shown in fig. 1b, a protein larger than  <dig> kda appeared specifically only if the mdp <dig> antibody was employed. this result is in line with the observation from matsumoto and colleagues  <cit> , who identified mdp <dig> as a  <dig> kda protein in sds-page, although its molecular weight was calculated to be  <dig> kda.

the mdp <dig> amount was measured by elisa in cultures of m. bovis bcg and m. bovis bcg grown to od  <dig>  . as shown in figure 1a, the antisense plasmid pas-mdp <dig> caused a considerable reduction of the expression of mdp <dig>  on average, m. bovis bcg synthesized about half the amount of mdp <dig> that was produced by m. bovis bcg.

mdp <dig> regulates the growth of m. bovis bcg in broth culture
the influence of the reduction of the amount of mdp <dig> protein on the in vitro growth rates of m. bovis bcg was determined by comparing growth curves of broth cultures from m. bovis bcg and m. bovis bcg generated by measurement of the od of the cultures  and their atp content . the antisense construct not only accelerated the growth of bcg but in addition enabled the bacteria to achieve a higher cell density in the stationary growth phase. the rlu values obtained with stationary phase cultures from m. bovis bcg exceeded the rlu values obtained with cultures from m. bovis bcg by factors of up to about  <dig>  . we wondered whether the growth curves generated by measurement of the atp content of the cultures might have been influenced by different atp synthesis rates of the two strains. therefore, we also measured the dna content of the cultures by quantitative real-time pcr. the measurement of the growth rates of the two strains by dna quantification also demonstrated a faster growth of the m. bovis bcg and its ability to achieve a higher cell mass in stationary phase .

mdp <dig> influences the aggregation of m. bovis bcg
cell aggregation of m. bovis bcg and m. bovis bcg was visualized by growing broth cultures of both strains and plating dilutions on agar plates. as shown in figure 3a, the colonies formed by the strain containing the vector pmv <dig> were very variable in size, pointing to the formation of large irregular aggregates in the broth culture. on the other hand, the strain containing the antisense construct formed more regularly sized and smaller colonies, indicating a less pronounced clumping of the bacteria in broth.

the stability of the aggregates generated by the two strains was investigated by analysis of the efficiency of aggregate disruption by sonication of diluted broth cultures for different time periods and plating of the sonified cultures on agar plates. figure 3a and 3b demonstrate the reduced stability of aggregates from m. bovis bcg compared to m. bovis bcg. a sonication for two minutes sufficed to disrupt to a large extent the aggregates formed by m. bovis bcg as was evident from the appearance of an enhanced number of colonies . the culture of m. bovis bcg, on the other hand, contained very large aggregates even after having been sonified for  <dig> minutes. the sonified culture still generated very large and variable colonies and only few small colonies were visible. the colony number of bcg had not augmented compared to the culture that had not been sonified .

mdp <dig> has an impact on the susceptibility of m. bovis bcg to ampicillin
changes in growth characteristics of bacteria may also influence their susceptibility towards antibiotics. to test this possibility, we measured the inhibitory effect of two selected antibiotics on the growth of m. bovis bcg and m. bovis bcg. rifampicin was chosen because of its importance for tuberculosis therapy. ampicillin was selected because mdp <dig> is a cell wall-associated protein and has been shown to be involved in cell wall biogenesis  <cit> . we inoculated cultures of the two strains in middlebrook medium without antibiotics as well as in medium with antibiotics and measured their growth during  <dig> days by quantification of the atp content of the cultures with a luciferase assay. the growth rates were displayed as relative light units . we then calculated the relative growth at a given time point by setting the rlu values achieved in cultures without antibiotics to 100%. the antisense construct did not significantly change the susceptibility towards rifampicin . however, it had a strong effect on the susceptibility towards ampicillin . after  <dig> and  <dig> days of growth in medium containing  <dig> μg ml- <dig> ampicillin, the m. bovis bcg containing pas-mdp <dig> was much more affected by the presence of the antibiotic than the reference strain. the most pronounced difference occurred after  <dig> days. at this time point, the bcg strain with the antisense-plasmid displayed a relative growth rate in the presence of ampicillin of only  <dig> %, while the bcg with pmv <dig> displayed a relative growth rate of 45%.

mdp <dig> affects the protein expression of m. bovis bcg grown in low oxygen conditions
the influence of mdp <dig> on gene regulation was analysed by generation of 2-dimensional protein gels. proteins were isolated both from cultures grown aerobically to an od  <dig>   and from cultures which were first grown aerobically to od  <dig>  and then transferred into a microaerobic atmosphere for ten days. the protein patterns of two strains grown aerobically did not diverge strongly . however, if the cultures were maintained in an oxygen-poor atmosphere, the m. bovis bcg strain containing the antisense construct pas-mdp <dig> showed a protein pattern that strongly differed from the reference strain containing the empty vector pmv <dig> . the proteome gels of the strain m. bovis bcg  exhibited less protein spots than those of the strain m. bovis bcg , and the spot intensity was also reduced for many of the proteins. interestingly, the spots representing the stress-related proteins groes and hspx were not affected by the presence of the antisense plasmid pointing to different effects of a reduction of the mdp <dig> amount on different proteins. on account of the extremely high isoelectric point  of  <dig>  of the mdp <dig> protein, it was not possible to identify mdp <dig> itself in the two-dimensional gels. two-dimensional protein gels from cultures transferred from a microaerobic to an anaerobic atmosphere for  <dig> days showed protein patterns similar to those obtained with the protein preparations from microaerobically grown cultures . the influence of the amount of mdp <dig> on the protein expression in cultures grown in microaerobic or anaerobic conditions indicates a role of mdp <dig> in the adaptation to oxygen limitation.

mdp <dig> influences the persistence of m. bovis bcg in macrophages
one of the most important virulence-related features of highly pathogenic mycobacteria is their ability to survive and multiply in macrophages. we therefore wondered whether the amount of mdp <dig> had an influence on the survival of m. bovis bcg in mouse and human macrophage lines. cultures of both strains grown to an od  <dig>   were used to infect the mouse macrophage line j <dig> a <dig> and the human macrophage line mm <dig>  the amount of intracellular bacteria was monitored by quantification of the dna content with real-time pcr during six days. as shown in figure 6a and 6b, there was no difference in the initial infection rate of either m. bovis bcg or m. bovis bcg. however, the antisense construct strongly enhanced the growth of m. bovis bcg within both macrophage lines. the amount of the bcg derivative containing the empty vector stayed relatively constant throughout the whole experiment. in contrast, the bcg with the antisense plasmid multiplied during the first two days after infection and had reduplicated in mm <dig> and even multiplied by six in j <dig> a <dig>  after this the bacterial load of m. bovis bcg somewhat decreased in both cell lines and then stayed relatively constant in j <dig> a <dig> and even increased again in mm <dig> 

discussion
the mdp <dig> protein belongs to a unique class of histone-like proteins  specific for mycobacteria. orthologous genes were identified in fast-growing apathogenic mycobacteria like m. smegmatis   <cit>  as well as in pathogenic species like m. bovis   <cit> , m. tuberculosis   <cit> , m. leprae   <cit> , m. avium  <cit>  and m. paratuberculosis  <cit> . the mdp <dig> protein possesses a striking combination of two features: it is a dna-binding protein which is also surface exposed  <cit> . the hlp have been associated with a large variety of cellular functions in different mycobacteria like replication, transcription and translation  <cit> , growth regulation  <cit> , adaptation to dormancy  <cit>  and adhesion to schwann and epithelial cells  <cit> . recently, the mdp <dig> gene from m. bovis has been shown to play an important role in cell wall biosynthesis by binding to the antigen  <dig>  and to its substrate trehalose-6-monomycolate  <cit> . the extremely strong expression of hlp reaching up to 8–10% of the total protein amount in m. bovis bcg  <cit>  suggests its high importance for mycobacterial growth and survival. this makes it all the more surprising that mutations in hlp genes had a relatively small effect on the phenotypes of the mutants. the disruption of the hupb gene from m. smegmatis neither changed the generation time nor the viability of dormant cultures in the study by lee et al.  <cit> . katsube et al.  <cit>  also observed only a slight effect on growth rate by mutagenesis of the hlp gene from m. smegmatis. similarly, a mdp <dig> knock-out mutant from m. bovis bcg showed no change in growth rate compared to the wild type bcg  <cit> . a mutation of the m. leprae hlp gene also did not affect the capacity to bind to schwann cells  <cit> . although these studies were performed either with other mycobacterial species or by using other testing methods, the discrepancy between the slight phenotypic changes caused by deletion mutagenesis or insertion mutagenesis compared to the strong changes caused by our antisense gene is astonishing. one possible explanation for the unexpected outcomes of the mutagenesis experiments is the complementation of the mutated hlp genes by other genes. for instance, it has been observed that the deletion of the main porin gene mspa from m. smegmatis entails an expression of otherwise silent porin genes  <cit> . a mycobacterial protein potentially able to fulfil some of the functions of hlp is the heparin-binding hemagglutinin . this protein exhibits striking similarities to hlp. both proteins produce a band at mw  <dig> kda in sds gels, are surface exposed and promote binding to epithelial cells  <cit> . they are both post-translationally methylated and show cross-reactivity due to the presence of copies of the motif apakkaa  <cit> . according to studies of verbelen et al.  <cit> , hbha is mainly responsible for mycobacterial aggregation.

since mutagenesis of hlp genes had not provided much information on their function, we chose the antisense technique as alternative method to assess the importance of the mdp <dig> gene for the growth behaviour of m. bovis bcg. we hoped that reducing the amount of mdp <dig> by an antisense construct instead of completely removing the protein by mutagenesis would lessen complementation effects by activation of other genes with similar functions. the antisense-fragment was selected taking into consideration the recommendation that an efficient antisense-rna should cover the start codon and the shine-dalgarno-sequence and have a size of at least 5% of the gene length  <cit> . the antisense technique has contributed to the clarification of the function of many mycobacterial genes. advantages of this technique are the possibility to analyse essential genes whose mutagenesis would be lethal and to repress genes present in several copies. examples of the application of the antisense technique in mycobacteria are the repression of ahpc from m. bovis  <cit> , dnaa from m. smegmatis  <cit> , fap-p from m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis  <cit>  or pknf from m. tuberculosis  <cit> . the degree of repression by antisense plasmids was estimated to be  <dig> to 30% in the study of secott et al.  <cit>  and 65% in the work of greendyke et al.  <cit> . greendyke and colleagues achieved this relatively strong repression by using the same vector system  as the one employed in our study. we could demonstrate a reduction in the amount of mdp <dig> by the antisense construct of about 50% in cultures grown aerobically in middlebrook 7h <dig> broth. since use of the antisense technique does not allow the proof of the absence of second-line mutations by complementation, we generated two independent m. bovis bcg transformants containing the plasmid pas-mdp <dig> and analysed their effect on the growth of bcg.

the influence of the antisense construct on the growth rate was shown to be considerable. the antisense strain not only grew faster than the reference strain, it also reached a much higher cell mass in stationary phase. the growth curves were generated by measurement of the atp content, a method only considering living cells. we favoured this method over plating and counting of colony forming units , because we estimate it to be more appropriate for out test system employing standing cultures for the measurement of growth over a relatively long time period. it has been shown that a proportion of the bacteria present in stationary phase and sustaining anoxia are not able to form colonies if plated on agar, although they are metabolically active, generate steady atp amounts and are able to grow in broth  <cit> . to exclude the possibility of varying atp contents as a consequence of varying metabolism of the strains, we also quantified the bacteria by quantitative real-time pcr. the dna quantification confirmed the faster growth of m. bovis bcg compared to the growth of the reference strain. this result is in contrast to the findings of chen et al.  <cit> , who observed no influence on the growth rate of their m. bovis bcg mdp <dig> mutant. however, it supports the hypothesis by matsumoto and colleagues  <cit> . these authors transformed rapidly growing mycobacteria into slow growing bacteria by transferring the mdp <dig> gene into the fast growers and postulated a participation of mdp <dig> in growth regulation and induction of the dormant state. a participation in the induction of the dormant state is also supported by the achievement of much higher cell masses in stationary phase observed in our study. under the influence of the antisense construct, the transition from the active growth phase into the stationary phase occurs at higher cell densities. this observation supports the hypothesis that up-regulation of mdp <dig> in stationary phase and dormant cultures results in a growth arrest which is delayed in the antisense strain expressing less mdp <dig> protein.

the mdp <dig> protein is surface exposed and has been shown to aggregate to nanomer polypeptides  <cit> . a lower amount of mdp <dig> on the surface of the bacteria may explain the reduced clumping and decreased stability of aggregates of m. bovis bcg compared to the reference strain. this finding implicates that the hbha protein mainly held responsible for the formation of mycobacterial aggregates  <cit>  is not the only factor mediating this characteristic feature of mycobacteria. the clumping of mycobacteria not only complicates many experimental procedures like determination of growth and infectious doses but also influences other important features. for example the clumping of m. tuberculosis is most pronounced in virulent strains  <cit> , and clumping can influence the accessibility of antibiotics into the bacteria. the reduced clumping of the antisense strain may also have contributed to its better growth in broth culture by ameliorating the uptake of nutrients.

an influence of the antisense construct on the susceptibility of m. bovis bcg to antibiotics was tested for rifampicin and ampicillin . rifampicin was selected because of its therapeutical importance. ampicillin interferes with the cell wall synthesis and was chosen because mdp <dig> plays a role in cell wall synthesis as was proven by katsube et al.  <cit> . while we could measure no significant effect of the antisense construct on the susceptibility towards rifampicin, it induced a strong increase in the susceptibility towards ampicillin. the interference of the antisense plasmid with the reaction against only one of the two antibiotics argues against a simply better diffusion of the antibiotics into the cells due to the reduced clumping of the bacteria, but suggests a more specific mechanism related to the mode of action of ampicillin. ampicillin inhibits the formation of cross-links in the peptidoglycan layer. the accelerated growth of m. bovis bcg requires a higher rate of peptidoglycan synthesis, thus perhaps rendering the bacteria more susceptible to ampicillin. it is also possible that the influence of the reduction in the amount of mdp <dig> on glycolipid synthesis enhances the diffusion of ampicillin through the bacterial cell wall. as a consequence the critical amount of ampicillin, which cannot be inactivated by the mycobacterial β-lactamases, may be reached at lower ampicillin concentrations than in the wild-type cells.

for further investigation of a possible involvement of mdp <dig> in the regulation of latency, we also performed growth experiments in microaerobic and anaerobic atmospheric conditions. in these experiments, cultures of the two strains were first maintained in an atmosphere containing  <dig> % to  <dig> % oxygen. in this way we simulated the situation in granulomas, where low-oxygen conditions are prevailing  <cit> . from these microaerobic conditions, the cultures were transferred into an anaerobic atmosphere with less than  <dig> % oxygen. we could not find significant growth differences between the two strains under low-oxygen conditions. while the protein patterns of aerobically grown cultures of the two strains did not differ significantly, the proteome analysis of cultures grown under low-oxygen conditions revealed a much stronger effect of the oxygen limitation on the m. bovis bcg strain expressing less mdp <dig> compared to the reference strain. the number of visible protein spots as well as the intensity of many spots was reduced in the antisense strain. it can therefore be assumed that mdp <dig> plays a role in the adaptation of the bacteria to hypoxic conditions, which is a prerequisite for the survival in the granuloma.

the mdp <dig> protein has homology to the hu class  of dna-binding proteins. hu proteins are capable of wrapping dna and stabilizing it from denaturation in extreme environmental conditions. together with h-ns , ihf , fis , lrp  and dps  they belong to a group of proteins which bind relatively unspecific to dna. binding of theses proteins to dna modulates the topology of the according dna regions and thus their accessibility for proteins involved in transcription. hereby the expression of genes lying in the concerned regions is affected  <cit> . the affinity of these dna-binding proteins to the dna is influenced by the environment, so that they are able to mediate the adaptation to changes in the environmental conditions. further studies are required to find out whether mdp <dig> plays a role in adapting the gene expression pattern to the conditions occurring during the infection process.

m. tuberculosis has an intracellular lifestyle and we therefore tested whether the growth acceleration caused by the antisense construct and the achievement of higher bacterial loads observed in broth also occurred inside macrophages. we quantified intracellular bcg by real-time pcr instead of colony counting, since it has been found by other authors that a substantial proportion of intracellular mycobacteria released from macrophages was unculturable by cfu plating, although the presence of viable cells could be shown with the mpn  method  <cit> . real-time pcr methods have also been evaluated for the quantification of other intracellular bacteria in macrophages, such as legionella pneumophila  <cit> . batoni et al.  <cit>  had shown that the hsp <dig> promoter from m. avium is not only active in bacteria growing in broth cultures but also in mycobacteria present inside murine macrophages. we therefore assumed that a repression of mdp <dig> expression by the antisense plasmid was also given during intracellular growth of the mycobacteria. the mdp <dig> antisense construct caused an increase in the amount of mycobacterial dna in both a human as well as a murine macrophage line. according to this, the mdp <dig> protein is involved in extra- as well as intracellular growth regulation. higher bacterial loads can influence many responses of the infected cells, like the degree of macrophage stimulation, cytokine expression or triggering of apoptosis. the mdp <dig> protein may therefore play an important role for virulence of mycobacteria.

CONCLUSIONS
the most striking feature of the mdp <dig> protein is its diversity with respect to localisation, biochemical properties and potential functions. the results obtained in this study are in line with several of its proposed functions. we observed a relatively strong effect on the extra- as well as intracellular growth rate, supporting the idea that mdp <dig> plays a role in the regulation of the generation time. the reduced aggregate formation of the antisense strain agrees with its localization on the cell surface of the bacteria and strengthens the hypothesis of a role in adhesion. the enhanced susceptibility of the antisense strain towards ampicillin supports the theory of its function in cell wall biosynthesis. finally, the diverging protein patterns of cultures of the antisense strain and the reference strain grown in low-oxygen atmosphere indicate a role in gene regulation and adaptation to dormancy and latency. our study demonstrates that mdp <dig> fulfils various functions important for the infection of host cells and the maintenance of the infection within the granuloma. our future efforts will concentrate on the analysis of the participation of mdp <dig> in granuloma formation and the persistence of mycobacteria inside these structures.
