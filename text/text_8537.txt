BACKGROUND
rice, one of the world's most important crops, is the staple food of over half of the world's population. cultivated rice occurs in two forms, oryza sativa and oryza glaberrima. oryza sativa, referred to as the asian rice, is cultivated worldwide but distributed mainly in asia and has two subspecies, indica and japonica, estimated to have diverged at least about  <dig>  years ago  <cit> . the two subspecies are further divided into major subpopulations: indica into aus and indica, japonica into temperate japonica, tropical japonica, and the aromatic group  <cit> . it has been proposed that these subpopulations were independently domesticated from divergent pools of o. rufipogon  <cit> .

during the process of domestication, genetic diversity in rice has reduced dramatically as a result of natural and artificial selection  <cit> . with the rapid development of molecular genomics, the path of domestication has been traced in detail through characterization of several domestication genes associated with artificial selection. for example, a major gene for grain shattering in rice, shattering  <dig> , has been characterized: nucleotide diversity of a ~ <dig> kb region surrounding sh <dig>  is nearly one-tenth of the average value across the entire chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . the non-shattering sh <dig> allele was fixed in all the o. sativa varieties surveyed. a selective sweep nearby the sh <dig> genomic region was probably due to strong artificial selection of the non-shattering allele, which confers a trait important to efficient grain harvest  <cit> . similar findings have been reported in two other selection-related genes in rice, namely red pericarp , which is responsible for pericarp colour, and waxy , for glutinous grains. the two were under strong artificial selection given the human preference for white rice and low-amylose grains. as a result, the level of polymorphism in and around these two genes is markedly reduced  <cit> . nucleotide diversity in the gene teosinte branched  <dig> , which is involved in plant architecture, is much lower in maize than in teosinte, the wild relative of maize. wang et al.  <cit>  showed that maize has retained only 3% of the diversity found in teosinte in the 5' non-transcribed region of tb <dig>  again as a result of human selection. this selection effect led to a selective sweep of a 60- <dig> kb long region across the 5' promoter to the tb1-transcribed sequence  <cit> . similarly, nucleotide variation in the gene phytoene synthase , which makes maize kernels yellow, was only  <dig> % of that in the gene that makes them white, owing to the human preference for yellow grains, which have higher nutritional value  <cit> . because of the effect of selection hitchhiking, nucleotide diversity was lower around the region of y <dig> from ~ <dig> kb downstream to ~ <dig> kb upstream  <cit> . these results provide significant insights into the selective sweeps brought about by artificial selection during the process of crop domestication.

ammonium is one of the major forms in which nitrogen is available for plant growth and reproduction. ammonium absorption from soil is mediated by ammonium transporters  through both high-affinity and low-affinity transport systems. the high-affinity transport system plays a major role when ammonium in soil is at micromolar ammonium concentrations, and the low-affinity transport system mainly at millimolar or higher concentrations  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis shows that the two systems are represented by amt subfamilies amt <dig> and amt <dig> respectively  <cit> . kaiser et al.  <cit>  reported that ammonium uptake decreased by about 30% in a t-dna insertion line of atamt1; <dig> compared to the wild-type, which encodes a high-affinity ammonium transporter in arabidopsis thaliana. other studies have also confirmed that the role of amt <dig> in other species  <cit> .

rice carries at least twelve amt genes  <cit> , three of which, osamt1; <dig> to osamt1; <dig>  have been identified as members of amt <dig>  each showing a distinct expression pattern: osamt1; <dig> shows constitutive expression in both shoots and roots; osamt1; <dig> shows root-specific and ammonium-inducible expression; and osamt1; <dig> shows root-specific and nitrogen-suppressible expression  <cit> . osamt1; <dig> has only one open reading frame encoding  <dig> amino acid residues. its transcript was abundant in roots of plants that were grown under low levels of nh4+ but decreased rapidly when the plants were transferred to a medium with high nh4+ concentration  <cit> . moreover, osamt1; <dig> expression was promoted by low ammonium in rice roots  <cit>  and regulated by endogenous glutamine rather than by endogenous ammonium  <cit> . however, nucleotide variations in osamt1; <dig> and in other key genes in the nitrogen uptake and assimilation pathway are yet to be elucidated, and their evolutionary path from wild rice to cultivated rice remains unclear.

improving the uptake and assimilation efficiency of nitrogen has been a major breeding target in rice, and success depends largely on discovering allelic variations of nitrogen metabolism genes in rice germplasm and understanding their adaptive significance. the objectives of the present study were 1) to investigate allelic variations of osamt1; <dig>  2) to analyse its pattern of polymorphism and its evolution, and 3) to define the extent of selective sweep around the osamt1; <dig> region in cultivated rice.

methods
rice materials
the nucleotide variation of the osamt1; <dig> gene was assessed in a panel of  <dig> oryza accessions comprising  <dig> accessions of o. sativa , and  <dig> of wild rice , and  <dig> of the african cultivated rice o. glaberrima . most of the o. sativa accessions -  <dig> of them were of landraces  - came from a collection of chinese rice varieties estimated to represent about 70% of the total diversity in chinese rice germplasm  <cit> . the other accessions of o. sativa, including  <dig> landraces, were selected from the oryzasnp project http://www.oryzasnp.org/. the  <dig> wild relatives with different original sources were obtained from the international rice research institute .

nucleotide diversity across the genomic region around osamt1; <dig> was also surveyed by sequencing seven gene segments from  <dig> accessions of o. sativa and  <dig> accessions of o. rufipogon .

pcr and dna sequencing
nucleotide diversity in the gene osamt1; <dig> and the surrounding genomic region was assessed by pcr amplification and sequencing. plant dna was extracted from young leaves of each accession using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide  method described by rogers and bendich  <cit> . all primers for the pcr were designed by primer premier  <dig>  based on the nipponbare genomic sequence available at the tigr website http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/cgi-bin/gbrowse/rice/. for osamt1; <dig>  four pairs of primers were used for pcr amplification to cover the entire coding sequence, ~ <dig> bp of the 5' promoter and ~ <dig> bp of the 3' untranslated region. for each locus around osamt1; <dig>  one pair of primer was designed to amplify fragments of the genomic dna approximately 860- <dig> bp long . to ensure that only the targeted genomic region is amplified, all pcr primers were confirmed by blast against the nipponbare genomic sequence in the ncbi database http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast.cgi.

the pcr experiments were performed on  <dig> μl amplification reaction consisting of  <dig>  unit of taq polymerase ,  <dig> mm tris-hcl,  <dig> mm kcl,  <dig>  mm mgcl <dig>   <dig>  mm dntps,  <dig>  μm of each primer, and  <dig> ng of genomic dna. pcr reactions were carried out in geneamp pcr system  <dig>  under the following conditions:  <dig> min at 94°c, followed by  <dig> cycles of  <dig> min at 94°c,  <dig> min at a primer-specific temperature , and  <dig> min at 72°c and, for a final extension,  <dig> min at 72°c.

pcr products were directly sequenced with the bigdye terminator cycle sequencing v <dig>   after digestion and purification according to the manufacturer's specifications. briefly, the pcr products were digested with exonuclease i  and shrimp alkaline phosphatase , and purified with 95% ethanol and  <dig> m sodium acetate . sequencing reactions were run on an automated capillary sequencer abi  <dig>  and sequence contigs were assembled and edited using sequencher  <dig> . <dig> . to ensure reliability of the sequencing data, pcr amplicons were sequenced in both orientations, and any remaining ambiguities in the sequences resolved by repeated pcr amplification and re-sequencing. almost all fragments were homozygous except two fragments from the two o. rufipogon accessions  with heterozygous sites. pcr products of these two fragments were cloned into pgem-t easy vectors  and five independent clones were sequenced for each fragment. if two different alleles were found, the predominant allele of the five clones was arbitrarily chosen for further analysis  <cit> .

data analysis
sequences alignment was conducted with clustalx  <dig>  ftp://ftp-igbmc.u-strasbg.fr/pub/clustalx/. the number of segregating sites and levels of nucleotide diversity pi , the average number of nucleotide differences per site between two sequences  <cit> , and θ, an estimate of 4neμ, where ne is the effective population size and μ is the mutation rate per nucleotide  <cit> , were computed in dnasp . tajima's d test and fu and li's d* test were also performed in dnasp for testing selections deviating from neutrality  <cit> . haplotype analysis was conducted using tassel   <cit> . to visualize the impact of sweep selection across the osamt1; <dig> genomic region, extended haplotype homozygosity  analysis was performed to measure the degree of linkage disequilibrium , as sweep selection is expected to elevate the ld nearby the selected site. ehh was reported on a scale from  <dig> to  <dig>  with  <dig> indicating that all extended haplotypes are different and  <dig> indicating that they are the same  <cit> .

to investigate selection pressure on osamt1; <dig>  ka/ks ratios  between osamt1; <dig> in rice and its homologs in the relative species were calculated using the method described by goldman and yang  <cit> . a ka/ks ratio significantly greater than one implies positive selection, less than one implies purifying selection, and a ratio of one may indicate neutrality  <cit> .

RESULTS
sequence diversity at osamt1;1
nucleotide polymorphism was examined in  <dig> accessions across the entire  <dig>  kb length of osamt1; <dig> including a  <dig> bp fragment of the 5' promoter region and a  <dig> bp fragment of the 3' untranslated region. the examination yielded  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  and  <dig> insertions or deletions  in this  <dig> -kb region , of which  <dig> polymorphism sites  were observed in the wild rice accessions and most were located in the non-coding region. five polymorphism sites, at positions - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> of the promoter region, occurred in high or intermediate frequencies in all the accessions , whereas at the coding region, ten snps - all synonymous variations - occurred rare frequency , indicating that the gene function had been conserved.

oryza rufipogon was found to be at least  <dig> times as diverse as o. sativa across the entire sequenced region, including the coding and non-coding regions of osamt1; <dig> . nucleotide diversity π of the entire gene sequence was  <dig> , and θ was  <dig>  for o. rufipogon, while estimates of π for indica and japonica were much lower . these results indicate that the diversity of osamt1; <dig> was much less in o. sativa than in its wild relatives. in addition, nucleotide polymorphism in the coding region was much lower than that in the non-coding region for all accessions . nucleotide diversity in the coding region was about a third of that in the non-coding region in o. rufipogon and about half in cultivated rice .

a n in parentheses is the number of accessions used; s, number of segregating sites; π, nucleotide diversity per site; θ, watterson's estimator; d <dig>  tajama's d; d <dig>  fu and li's d*; na, not applied; *, ** significant at  <dig>  and  <dig>  level for tajama's d , respectively.

such extreme reduction in diversity of osamt1; <dig> was observed in both landraces of o. sativa and its elite varieties . on the other hand, in the case of two other nitrogen-related genes , the reduction in diversity in landraces and elite varieties was more modest; in fact in the case of loc_os <dig> g <dig>  the extent of diversity in landraces was nearly the same as that in elite lines of o. sativa .

results of tajima's d and fu and li's d* tests for the entire region and the non-coding region of osamt1; <dig> were negative and significantly deviated from neutrality in all accessions, as well as in o. sativa samples. fu and li's d* values were not significant in the coding region in any of the accessions and subsamples . sliding window analysis of the pattern of polymorphism across the gene in o. sativa  and o. rufipogon  revealed a sharp peak at a point of about  <dig> bp upstream of the start codon of the gene . these results suggest a strong selection at osamt1; <dig>  particularly in the 5' promoter region.

notably, nine snps in the coding region of osamt1; <dig> that occurred in the wild relatives were all synonymous , suggesting that osamt1; <dig> is under purifying selection in the wild. to further validate this suggestion, ka/ks ratios were also calculated between osamt1; <dig> and its homologs in o. barthii , sorghum bicolor , and zea mays  from the tigr website. the ratios ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , significantly less than  <dig>  , suggesting strong purifying selection of osamt1; <dig> 

haplotype variations across osamt1;1
a total of  <dig> haplotypes were identified in the entire region of gene osamt1; <dig> in the  <dig> accessions. phylogenetic analysis showed that these distinct haplotypes fell into three groups . in group a, four haplotypes, h <dig> to h <dig>  were detected in o. sativa. most  accessions of the asian cultivated rice  belonged to haplotype h <dig>  each of the haplotypes h <dig> to h <dig> in group a differed from h <dig> in only a single nucleotide site, whereas haplotype h <dig> differed from h <dig> in several sites . the  <dig> accessions of o. rufipogon fell into as many as  <dig> distinct haplotypes, indicating a high level of genetic variation in o. rufipogon . in group b, o. glaberrima and o. barthii had the same haplotype, h <dig>  indicating their close genetic relationship. five o. nivara and four o. rufipogon belonged to group c. as can be seen in figure  <dig>  almost all accessions of o. sativa are of haplotype h <dig>  which incorporates the alleles at positions - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> in the 5' promoter region, whereas practically every accession of the wild rice is of a different haplotype. incidentally, the one exception from o. sativa was of haplotype h <dig> 

selective sweep surrounding osamt1;1
to assess the impact of selection at osamt1; <dig>  the extent of nucleotide polymorphism was examined at seven loci within a region around osamt1; <dig> approximately  <dig> kb long. the average nucleotide diversity  for o. sativa was low at five loci from - <dig>  kb to  <dig>  kb  but markedly high at the other two loci of - <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb. the relative levels of nucleotide diversity between o. sativa and o. rufipogon were also calculated across the osamt1; <dig> genomic region. a striking reduction in the relative diversity  was observed along the same region mentioned above  . these results indicate a selective sweep around osamt1; <dig> extending about  <dig> kb in length.

transcriptional corepressor
a position of sampled loci as far to the first nucleotide of osamt1; <dig> that was considered as  <dig> kb; b length  of sampled alignment regions is relative to nipponbare genomic sequence; c pi , nucleotide diversity per site; hd, haplotype diversity; d <dig>  tajama's d; d <dig>  fu and li's d*; *, ** significant at  <dig>  and  <dig>  level, respectively; d the relative ratio of pi for o. sativa to o. rufipogon.

similar patterns were drawn from hd, a measure of haplotype diversity, the value of which for o. sativa was markedly lower for the five loci along the stretch from - <dig>  kb to  <dig>  kb than that for either of the loci at - <dig>  kb or  <dig>  kb. however, hd for o. rufipogon was much higher across all six loci including the gene osamt1; <dig> . the values of fu and li's d* tests were significantly negative for the five loci  in o. sativa, which is a signature of selection in osamt1; <dig> genomic region from o. rufipogon to o. sativa .

lastly, the extent of linkage disequilibrium  was measured by calculating the extended haplotype homozygosity  for o. sativa and o. rufipogon. the average ehh value was  <dig>  in o. sativa across the region from - <dig>  kb to  <dig>  kb but abruptly dipped to  <dig>  at the other two loci . the high value of ld along a distance of ~ <dig> kb  in o. sativa and the marked reduction in ld in o. rufipogon on either side of the core location in the promoter of osamt1; <dig>  support the idea of a strong selection acting on osamt1; <dig> 

discussion
diversity and selection of osamt1;1
artificial selection is believed to have played an important role in the severe reduction of genetic diversity in cultivated rice during its domestication from its wild ancestors. osatm1; <dig> plays a key role in ammonium uptake and assimilation in rice but whether osatm1; <dig> and other nitrogen-uptake genes were subjected to selection pressure during the domestication process is an open question. in the present study, we sequenced the entire gene osamt1; <dig> in a panel of  <dig> rice accessions, drawn mostly from chinese cultivated rice , and observed the predominance of one major haplotype  and extreme reduction in genetic diversity of osamt1; <dig> in cultivated rice compared to that in its wild progenitor o. rufipogon. the level of nucleotide polymorphism  in osamt1; <dig> in o. sativa was also markedly lower than that in  <dig> randomly chosen gene fragments   <cit>  and in  <dig> reference genes from o. sativa   <cit> . this severe reduction of genetic diversity in cultivated rice and ka/ks ratios far below  <dig>   are probably characteristic of very strong selection pressure acting on osatm1; <dig> 

the severe reduction of genetic diversity and predominance of a single common haplotype in both subspecies may be a consequence of strong selection for the promoter region that potentially affects transcription of osamt1; <dig>  this strong selection for the non-coding regions of osatm1; <dig> in o. sativa is supported by the significantly negative values of tajima's d and fu and li's d* tests . we found that o. sativa specifically carried three polymorphic sites differing from the most wild rice accessions at positions of - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> that were adjacent to several core domains such as tata box in the promoter, which is a cis-regulatory dna region that facilitates transcription of a particular gene for functional adaptation. we observed different expression levels of osamt1; <dig> in several near-isogenic lines that carried the alleles of osamt1; <dig> from o. rufipogon and o. sativa in the similar genetic background . the expression of the o. rufipogon alleles in shoot of the near-isogenic line was significantly higher than that of zs <dig>  however, further investigation is necessary to explain the advantages conferred by the selected allelic variations in osamt1; <dig> during domestication. several studies have shown that sequence variations in the promoter region result in differential regulation of transcription. for example, crawford et al.  <cit>  revealed that the lactate dehydrogenase-b  proximal promoter sequence affected transcriptional processes and constituted a phenotypic change that was subject to natural selection by temperature differences. konishi et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the 5' regulatory region of the qtl for seed shattering in chromosome  <dig>  causes loss of seed shattering and was therefore the target of artificial selection during rice domestication. similarity, the promoter and proximal intergenic region of tb <dig> was the target of selection, and a selective sweep ~ <dig> kb in length across this 5' region occurred during maize domestication  <cit> .

furthermore, the ld value was high along a ~ <dig> kb region in o. sativa, but fell sharply in o. rufipogon. fu and li's d* tests were significant for five loci located in a region from - <dig>  kb to  <dig>  kb. these observations indicate a selective sweep within and nearby osamt1; <dig> . many agronomically important genes such as sh <dig> and waxy were under strong artificial selection leading to a selective sweep around the site of those genes. we infer a similar selective sweep around osamt1; <dig> caused largely by natural selection for an ammonium transporter.

reasons for osamt1; <dig> selection
the common wild rice o. rufipogon is found in ditches, pools, and other sites with shallow, standing, or slow-running water. in these natural habitats, the level of nitrogen is extremely low  <cit> . nitrogen, either as ammonia or as nitrite, is present only in traces both in water and in the sediment around such habitats. therefore, a nitrogen uptake system that can manage to obtain nitrogen from such infertile soil was most likely a target of selection during the transition from the wild progenitor to cultivated rice. in addition, until the arrival of nitrogenous fertilizers, the major sources of nitrogen were animal excreta and plant and animal residues, the ultimately usable forms being ammonia, acid amides, and urea. as a result, ammonium was the main form of nitrogen in anaerobic rice paddy environments  <cit>  - these habitats remained unchanged for thousands of years until the 20th century, which saw large-scale application of chemical fertilizers. even for current rice cultivation in paddy fields, ammonium remains the major form of inorganic nitrogen, making rice almost dependent on ammonium nutrition during a large part of the cropping season. in terms of the efficiency of fertilizer use, ammonium is superior to nitrate in paddy soils  <cit> . therefore, a high-affinity ammonia transporter such as osamt1; <dig> for ammonium uptake in rice  <cit> , would have proved advantageous in adapting to domestication and remained under continual selection pressure in low-nitrogen soils.

we note that of  <dig> annotated genes located in the ~ <dig> kb genomic region around osamt1; <dig> based on the tigr website , nine are reported to be involved in plant responses to such biotic and/or abiotic stresses as extreme temperatures, drought, excess salt, and infectious pathogens  <cit> . rice has adapted to changes in several environmental features . selection for these genes nearby osamt1; <dig> rather than osamt1; <dig> alone could not be excluded as the cause of the selective sweep around the osamt1; <dig> genomic region. however, inadequate soil nitrogen should be the most widespread selection pressure in operation for both subspecies, irrespective of their locations. we therefore suggest that fixation of the alleles of osamt1; <dig> common to the two subspecies indica and japonica is the result of a combined force of natural selection for more than one trait. unlike the domestication genes, rc, sh <dig>  and wx that were involved in traits strongly preferred by humans  <cit> , the gene osamt1; <dig> may have been selected as a results of soils deficient in nitrogen.

evolutionary process of osamt1;1
in the present study, haplotype h <dig> is predominant and fixed at osamt <dig>  in both subspecies . this dominant haplotype was also found in o. rufipogon albeit in very low frequency - only one o. rufipogon accession, namely dwr <dig> from malaysia, carried it - suggesting a possibility that haplotype h <dig> first occurred in one of the subspecies of o. sativa and introgressed into the wild rice. we also observed that one o. rufipogon accession  had only one snp  at position - <dig> compared to h <dig> . this instance of high diversity of the gene in the wild relatives but uniform outcome because all mutations were synonymous suggests another possibility, namely that the haplotype h <dig> of osamt1; <dig> occurred first in one of the accessions of o. rufipogon , and underwent strong selection pressure during domestication. a similar pattern was reported in the non-shattering allele  fixed in  <dig> rice cultivars  <cit> . actually, two models, snowballing model and combination model, were previously proposed considering single and multiple origins of cultivated rice, respectively  <cit> . these two models reconciled the data for sh <dig>  these models could also be applied in osamt1; <dig> as osamt1; <dig> and sh <dig> shared the same features in terms of the nucleotide diversity. however, current sequence data from osamt1; <dig> and sh <dig> might be not strong enough to distinctly support which model is correct. with the rapid development of sequencing technology, more genes similar to osamt1; <dig> and sh <dig> would be discovered in the rice genome. further cloning and functional characterization of these genes will help test the models of rice domestication.

additionally, although genetic diversity in indica was double or triple of that in japonica, genetic diversity in common wild rice o. rufipogon around osamt1; <dig> was more than  <dig> times higher than that both indica and japonica rice . it is remarkable that genetic diversity in two other nitrogen-related genes decreased gradually from the wild relatives to the cultivated rice, whereas the reduction was extreme in the case of osamt1; <dig> . therefore the selection around osamt1; <dig> may have occurred before the divergence of indica and japonica. several domestication genes such as rc and waxy found in domesticated forms with their favorable alleles occurred first in the japonica cultivars and experienced the selective sweep under strong artificial selection during domestication, causing the alleles to become fixed in all subpopulations of rice  <cit> . osamt1; <dig> with only one predominant haplotype in both indica and japonica cultivars even in landraces supports the contention that the gene was first under purifying selection in the wild and then under positive selection during domestication . however, further investigations using many more samples drawn from locations across the world are required for more definitive answers.

CONCLUSIONS
the ammonium transporter osamt1; <dig> showed abundant genetic diversity in o. rufipogon -- diversity that has been dramatically lost in o. sativa owing to natural and artificial selection during the domestication of rice. this severe reduction in the extent of variation in nucleotides of osamt1; <dig> in the cultivated rice  extends to a genomic region about  <dig> kb long, indicating a selective sweep around osamt1; <dig>  this study demonstrates that the selective sweep was caused by strong selection within or nearby the ammonium transporter during the process of domestication of rice from its wild progenitors to cultivated rice. understanding the diversity pattern of the ammonium transporter gene in rice not only provides valuable information on the allelic distribution of the nitrogen-uptake gene, but also gives important insights into the process of domestication of cultivated rice. for example, given the alleles fixed at osamt1; <dig> in o. sativa, it is possible to discover novel alleles in wild relatives to broaden the genetic variation for improving the efficiency of nitrogen uptake in plants. it will also be worthwhile to elucidate the pattern of diversity of homologs of amt <dig> in other crops or of other nitrogen genes in rice.
