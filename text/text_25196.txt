BACKGROUND
mscs first described by friedenstein  <cit>  show great potency of differentiation into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes, and other lineages  <cit> , and have gained widespread use in various research fields, and created great promise for cell therapy. while bone marrow derived mscs  have been successfully isolated by plastic adherence from many species including human, bovine and rat  <cit> , isolation of normal ploidy mouse mscs  from bone marrow remains to be big challenging. first, mmscs isolated by the classical method of plastic adherence are frequently contaminated by overgrown hematopoietic cells  <cit> . mmscs could be purified at early passage by immunodepletion of hemaetopoetic cells, but the immunodepleted cells exhibited poor proliferation  <cit> . other methods for purifying mmscs require long-term culture under various conditions  <cit> . however, those isolated mmscs were actually immortalized stromal cell lines similar to hundreds of murine marrow stromal cell lines established during the past few decades  <cit> . this was further proved by several studies showing that mmscs could transform spontaneously upon in vitro culture  <cit> .

another characteristic of mmscs is their high chromosomal instability  <cit> . bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in vivo adapt to low oxygen tension in the bone microenvironment  <cit> ; culture under normal oxygen atmosphere  may exert excess oxidative damage to mmscs. furthermore, mouse cells are more sensitive than human cells to oxygen  <cit> , and immortalization of mef under 20% o <dig> has been associated with increased oxidative dna damage  <cit> . thus, mmscs under standard culture conditions  could be especially vulnerable to oxidative damage, leading to chromosome instability and finally immortalization and transformation. indeed, low oxygen has been consistently shown to improve proliferation of mscs in several species including human, rat, and porcine  <cit> , and also primary mmscs  <cit> .

mscs seeded onto extracellular matrix  show enhanced proliferation. ecm or components of ecm such as laminin and collagen could increase expansion ability of human mscs  <cit> . hyaluronan and fibrin also improve proliferation of mouse adipose-derived mscs and bone marrow mscs, respectively  <cit> . nevertheless, intact ecm created from pys- <dig> cells influences proliferation of human mscs more than its major components, laminin and type iv collagen. ecm generated from mef  is widely used as a substrate for derivation and maintenance of human embryonic stem cell  lines  <cit> . it would be interesting to test whether mef-ecm affects proliferation and ploidy of mmscs.

initially, we attempted to isolate mmscs under classical 20% o <dig> condition and obtained only immortalized mmscs lines with frequent chromosome abnormalities and even with tumorigenic potentials. following extensive experimentation, we developed an improved method to purify mmscs with normal ploidy by seeding marrow cells directly onto mef-ecm at  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/cm <dig> under 2% o <dig>  with addition of antioxidants in the primary culture.

RESULTS
culture under 20% o <dig> leads to immortalization of mmscs
initially, we attempted to optimize culture conditions for mmscs under 20% o <dig>  efficiency of isolation of mmscs was compared by culture in wells coated with gelatin or fibronectin or uncoated wells, different basal medium including dmem and rpmi  <dig>  fetal bovine serum of 10-20% of various sources, a variety of growth factors including pdgf, egf, lif  <cit> , or bfgf  <cit> , and conditioned medium including mef conditioned medium, bone marrow conditioned medium <cit> , and stempro msc sfm . under all these conditions, mmscs ceased growth at passage 3- <dig> after about 3- <dig> weeks from the initiation of the culture. continued culture after growth-ceasing period resulted in renewed growth and immortalization of the cells about two months in culture. karyotype analysis of  <dig> such immortalized mmsc lines showed that all these cell lines exhibited extensive abnormal karyotype, mainly composed of polyploidy. five cell lines were subjected to telomere fish analysis with pna probe specific for telomere repeats, and very weak telomere signals and end-to-end chromosome fusions were revealed in all cell lines analyzed . five selected cell lines with high proliferation capacity were further tested for their potential in vivo tumorigenicity using immunodeficient nude mice. one cell line  generated osteosarcoma-like tumor , similar to other studies  <cit> ; another cell line  showed teratoma-like tumor formation .

low  o <dig> improves purification of mmscs
consistent with previous studies  <cit> , low oxygen  significantly improved the proliferation of mmscs and the cell number increased approximately ten-fold  under culture at 2% o <dig>  compared to 20% o <dig> . to understand the underlying mechanisms, mmscs cultured under both conditions were depleted of cd <dig> and ter <dig> positive cells and the resultant immunodepleted mmscs  were analyzed for dna damage by micronucleus assay  <cit> . spontaneous micronucleus formation was found at higher levels in idmmscs cultured under 20% o <dig> than under 2% o <dig> , indicating accelerated proliferation of mmscs under low oxygen condition in association with reduced nuclear damage.

more homogeneous cell population of fibroblast-like cells were found in mmscs cultured under 2% o <dig>  compared to those under 20% o <dig> . flow cytometry analysis showed that contamination by hematopoietic cells was greatly reduced by hypoxic culture. under low oxygen, cell populations showed less expression of cd <dig> and cd11b antigens while maintaining high expression of sca- <dig> and cd <dig> , indicative of mscs in most species. these results indicate that low oxygen improves purification of mmscs, consistent with observations on rat mscs  <cit> .

low density plating strategy was proved to benefit purification of mmscs  <cit> . primary mmscs obtained under 2% o <dig> were replated at  <dig> /cm <dig> and incubated for  <dig> to  <dig> days. at this stage, most of the cultured cells  appeared as fibroblasts-like cells, similar to idmmscs cultured under 2% o <dig>  moreover their epitopes were also similar to those of idmmscs, negative for hematopoietic marker cd <dig> and cd11b, and endothelial marker cd <dig> and flk- <dig>  but positive for sca- <dig> and cd <dig> . under appropriate conditions, cmmscs at passage one were readily induced to differentiate into adipocytes, osteocytes and chondrocytes . together, culture of mmscs under 2% o <dig> could successfully deplete most of contaminated hematopoietic cells, such that relatively pure mmscs could be obtained at very early passage.

mef-ecm enhances proliferation of mmscs
next, mef-ecm was tested for proliferation capacity of mmscs under 2% o <dig>  as human marrow aspirates seeded directly on ecm lead to unwanted adherent of many other cells than mscs  <cit> , marrow cells were initially seeded on bare plastic, and then the primary mmscs replated on mef-ecm at  <dig> cells/cm <dig>  the growth rate of mmscs on mef-ecm  was much higher than that cultured on plastic as control . emmscs were more confluent, showing smaller cells, compared to cmmscs at day  <dig> , and the population doublings of emmscs were also greater than that of cmmscs . the identity of expanded cells cultured on mef-ecm was confirmed by epitope analysis and differentiation assays .

we further tested whether effects of mef-ecm on expansion of mmscs were associated with decreased oxidative damage. first, we measured levels of cellular reactive oxygen species  in mmscs. ros generated during normal oxidative metabolism may cause damage to dna and contribute to genomic instability  <cit> . cellular dcfda fluorescence, indicative of relative ros levels, was found significantly reduced in emmscs compared to cmmscs . we then evaluated the dna double-strand breaks using flow cytometry analysis of γ-h2ax, which is routinely used to measure dna damage caused by endogenous oxidants and other factors such as magnetic resonance imaging  exposure  <cit> . emmscs showed greatly decreased γ-h2ax intensity compared to cmmscs , suggesting reduced oxidative damage to mmscs cultured on mef-ecm. reduced dna damage was further revealed by micronucleus assay. while cmmscs exhibited higher frequency of spontaneous micronucleus formation, emmscs showed greatly reduced mn . thus, mmscs expanded on mef-ecm showed reduced oxidative damage.

the above data show that combination of low oxygen and mef-ecm can be used to obtain relatively pure proliferative mmscs at early passages. we then examined whether the isolated mmscs had normal karyotype. about 56%  metaphases prepared from emmscs at passage one had normal number of  <dig> chromosomes , in contrast to reduced normal karyotypes from cmmscs , indicating a possible role of mef-ecm in maintaining chromosome stability of mmscs.

antioxidants increase proliferation and chromosome stability of mmscs
the chromosome abnormalities in early passage mmscs indicate that culture under low oxygen is not sufficient to protect mmscs from oxidative damage. to further decrease possible accumulation of oxidative damage and therefore improve long-term viability of mmscs, a combination of two antioxidants  was used for initial isolation of mmscs. pbn is a free radical spin trapping agent and has been shown to reduce oxidative damage and extend lifespan of human fibroblasts and peritoneal mesothelial cells  <cit> . nac is an antioxidant that acts as the precursor of glutathione and as a scavenger of free radicals  <cit> . antioxidants reduced number of spontaneous micronucleus  and significantly improved proliferation , and increased normal karyotype of primary mmscs , suggesting that antioxidants could effectively reduce oxidative damage to mmscs.

to test whether artificial induction of oxidative stress increases chromosomal damages and abnormalities, we treated mmscs for  <dig> hours with h2o <dig> at the concentrations that did not cause immediate cell death and found that h2o <dig> reduced cell proliferation  and induced chromosomal damages as shown by increased rates of micronuclei , despite that the concentration and treatment time of h2o <dig> used in this experiment did not cause appreciable abnormal karyotypes of mmscs .

we further evaluated effects of antioxidants on proliferation and ploidy of mmscs following longer-term culture. mmscs cultured without antioxidants showed a phase of slow growth at passage  <dig> and most of cells exhibited flat enlarged morphology like senescence, followed by gradual renewed growth possibly due to outgrowth of some actively growing colonies. in contrast, cells cultured with antioxidants continued proliferation. notably, pemmscs  proliferated to passage  <dig> without obvious growth arrest . mmscs at passage  <dig> proliferated actively and showed typical mscs morphology as fibroblast-like cells. yet, cmmscs, emmscs or pcmmscs  at passage  <dig> showed nearly absent normal karyotype, whereas pemmscs at passage  <dig> still showed normal ploidy in 28%  of spreads analyzed . these results indicate that combination of antioxidants and mef-ecm might reduce oxidative damage to mmscs to some extent and improve viability and chromosome stability of mmscs for longer-term.

isolation of primary mmscs with normal ploidy by seeding bone marrows cells directly onto mef-ecm
finally, we tested whether combination of antioxidants with mef-ecm at the initial isolation step could increase mmscs with normal karyotype. bone marrow cells were seeded at a density of  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/cm <dig> in wells seeded with mef-ecm and cultured as above. cells cultured by day  <dig> showed mainly dense colonies composed of smaller spindle-shaped cells, but some dispersed small round cells outside dense colonies were also seen, possibly indicative of some contamination by hemaetopoietic cells. notably, the isolated primary mmscs showed normal karyotype in the majority  of cells analyzed, while only 58% of mmscs cultured on plastic as control had normal karyotype . further, bone marrow cells were seeded at a lower density of  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/cm <dig> to enrich more pure mmscs. as a result, colonies composed of more pure spindle-shaped cells were obtained by day  <dig>  flow cytometry analysis revealed typical epitopes of mmscs nearly free of hematopoietic cell contamination, and their tri-lineage differentiation potential into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes was also confirmed . importantly, most of these mmscs exhibited normal ploidy .

generation of induced pluripotent stem cells from mmscs
we next tested whether mmscs isolated by the new combination method could be used to generate ips cells. by transfection of mmscs with four yamanaka's factors carried by retroviral vectors, we successfully derived ips cells from mmscs. mmscs generated alkaline phosphatase-positive colonies with dynamics and efficiency similar to those of tail-tip fibroblasts  . forty eight such colonies were picked and passaged for both mmscs and ttfs cultures, three such subcultures of mmscs and two of ttfs expanded and gave rise to stable cell lines  with morphology and characteristics of mouse es cells. it seemed that mmscs generated ips cell-like colonies by day  <dig>  little earlier than did ttfs. to validate mmscs derived ips cells, the expression of pluripotency-associated transcription factors and surface marker was analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy, and mmscs-ips cells expressed oct <dig>  nanog and ssea <dig>  similar to ttfs-ips cells .

discussion
mscs are routinely cultured under 20% o <dig> in dmem or α-mem, supplemented with 10-20% fetal bovine serum. isolation and long-term culture of mouse mscs under these classical culture conditions has been found problematic, compared to that of other species  <cit> . consistent with previous studies  <cit> , our data show that normal ploidy mmscs are rarely achieved despite of enormous efforts to optimize culture conditions under 20% o <dig>  however, mmscs can be purified simply by culture under 2% o <dig>  mainly attributable to significantly improved proliferation of mmscs and reduced oxidative damage. also, passaging by harvesting only easily detached cells without pipetting  <cit>  and seeding at a relatively low density of  <dig> cells/cm <dig> improves purification and proliferation of mmscs, such that a purer population of mmscs could be obtained only  <dig> days after initiation of culture.

ecm prepared from mef further expands mmscs and reduces oxidative damage. this might be explained by more undifferentiated state and higher antioxidant defence capacity of mmscs expanded by mef-ecm. stress defence of stem cells is usually superior to that of differentiated cells  <cit> , and ecm could maintain higher differentiation potential of multipotent mscs than that of bare plastic  <cit> . we did not quantitatively compare the differentiation potential of mmscs expanded on plastic and mef-ecm, but the smaller size may imply a more undifferentiated state of mmscs expanded by mef-ecm. thus, combination of low oxygen and mef-ecm might provide an effective strategy for obtaining relatively pure mmscs at more undifferentiated state and with less oxidative damage at early passage.

however, mmscs cultured on either plastic or mef-ecm show high frequency of chromosome abnormalities. further, chromosome abnormalities are found just upon primary in vitro culture of bone marrow cells. consistently, several groups have already reported chromosome abnormalities in bone marrow derived mmscs cultured under 20% o <dig>  <cit> . recently, adipose tissue-derived mmscs under long-term culture also exhibit chromosomal abnormalities  <cit> , suggesting mouse species-specific sensitivity to oxidative damage and chromosomal instability  <cit> . chromosome abnormalities found in early passage mmscs under 2% o <dig> suggest that low oxygen alone or in combination with mef-ecm is insufficient to protect mmscs from oxidative damage and chromosome instability. but increased rates of normal chromosomes found in emmscs than in cmmscs suggest a possible role of mef-ecm in reducing chromosome instability of mmscs.

antioxidants might confer mmscs additional antioxidant defence capacity. a combination of two antioxidants  significantly reduces spontaneous mn and increases normal karyotype of primary mmscs, in association with increased proliferation of mmscs. particularly, mmscs could be expanded continuously on mef-ecm without noticeable growth arrest for at least  <dig> passages . one-third of pemmscs still exhibit normal ploidy by passage  <dig>  in contrast to nearly absent normal ploidy found in cmmscs, emmscs and pcmmscs, suggesting that antioxidants in combination with mef-ecm improve proliferation and chromosomal stability of mmscs.

together, a method to isolate mmscs with normal ploidy is developed by combination of low oxygen, antioxidants and mef-ecm. consistent with another study  <cit> , directly seeding marrow cells on mef-ecm leads to contamination of a small fraction of hemaetopoietic cells. this problem can be partly resolved by lowering seeding density from  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/cm <dig> to  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/cm <dig>  seeding at low density has been adopted to obtain pure primary mmscs  <cit> . as a result, a purified population of mmscs with normal ploidy can be obtained only  <dig> days after initiation of primary culture.

the quality of mmscs isolated by the new combination method was further tested by their potential to generate ips cells. ips cells have been induced from various types of mouse cells, including fibroblasts  <cit> , adipose tissue-derived cells and neural stem cells  <cit> , and hepatocytes and gastric epithelial cells  <cit> . poor quality of mmscs may hinder their reprogramming process of ips cells. with limited experiments, we successfully generated ips cells from mmscs isolated by our new method with at least comparable efficiency to ttfs, one of the most commonly used donor cells for ips induction  <cit> . we found that ips cell like colonies formed earlier from mmscs than from ttfs, suggesting that mmscs could be prone to reprogramming. however, more studies are needed to determine whether the resulted ips cells from mmscs show more complete reprogramming and higher quality than from other cell types, but successful generation of ips cells from mmscs validated the effectiveness of our new method. on the other hand, accessibility in clinics of somatic cells for ips induction is a consideration. our method can be adaptable to human mscs derived from bone marrow aspirations, since both low oxygen and ecm are shown to benefit for growth of human mscs  <cit> . hmscs cultured by the new method could be appropriate somatic cells for induction of ips cells for potential therapeutic uses.

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed a method for isolation of relatively pure primary mmscs with normal ploidy by combination of low oxygen, mef-ecm, antioxidants and low density plating strategy. mmscs isolated by this method were successfully used to generate ips cells. these normal ploidy mmscs could also be useful for numerous other studies in the mesenchymal stem cell field. our data also suggest that conditions for long-term culture of mmscs should be developed to maintain normal ploidy mmscs for future uses.
