BACKGROUND
bifidobacteria are anaerobic high g + c gram-positive bacteria that belong to the bifidobacterium genus, which contains more than  <dig> species. bifidobacterium is a prevalent bacterial genus in the human colon that represents up to 90% of all bacteria in fecal samples of breast-fed infants and  <dig> to 5% of adult fecal microbiota  <cit> . in full-term breast-fed infants, the intestinal microbiota is rapidly dominated by bifidobacteria that are acquired from mothers' microbiota during birth. these bacteria contribute to the establishment of healthy intestinal ecology and can confer health benefits to their host. indeed, impairment of bifidobacterial colonization is a risk factor for allergic diseases  <cit>  and for necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants  <cit> . consequently, bifidobacteria are the subject of growing interest due to their assumed contribution to the maintenance of gastrointestinal health  <cit> . for these reasons, some bifidobacterial strains are used as health-promoting or probiotic components in functional food products  <cit> .

although bifidobacteria have been reported to exert a number of positive biological effects, there has been limited research into the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects. this may be due in part to reports that some of the positive biological activities of bifidobacteria are strain-dependent  <cit>  and to the limited number of sequenced genomes. applying genomics to bifidobacteria is essential for a better understanding of their effects. indeed, comparative genomic studies of the few sequenced genomes of bifidobacteria has contributed to a better understanding of the stress response  <cit> , bacterial phylogeny and ecological adaptation  <cit> , and genetic variability  <cit> . within the bifidobacterium genus, the first completed genome sequence was that of the probiotic strain b. longum ncc <dig>  which became available in  <dig>  <cit>  and was revised in  <dig> . recently, the assembled genome of b. longum djo10a became available in the ncbi database , allowing this genetic information to be used for comparisons and functional analyses such as proteomic comparisons.

unlike genome studies, investigations at the proteomic level provide insights into protein abundance and/or post-transcriptional modifications. proteomic studies of the bifidobacterium genus have established reference maps  <cit> ; comparisons of differentially expressed proteins have shed light on bacterial adaptations to gastrointestinal tract factors such as bile  <cit>  and acidic ph  <cit> . although two-dimensional electrophoresis  has been used to analyze bacterial protein polymorphisms and to distinguish between closely related pathogenic organisms  <cit> , 2d-electrophoresis has not been used to compare bifidobacteria.

in this study, our objective was to compare three human b. longum isolates with the model sequenced strain b. longum ncc <dig> at the chromosome and proteome levels. pulse-field gel electrophoresis  revealed a high degree of heterogeneity. moreover, the isolates showed different patterns in terms of their cytoplasmic proteins that may reveal correlations with specific phenotypic differences of the b. longum strains. our results show that this approach is a valuable tool for exploring the natural diversity and the various capabilities of bifidobacteria strains.

RESULTS
in the present study, we chose b. longum ncc <dig> as the reference strain because  b. longum is one of three species used as probiotics;  the entire genome sequence is available, allowing protein identification using a public database  <cit> ;  a proteome reference map had been established for this strain  <cit> . three b. longum human isolates with known biological effects were compared to this reference strain. in an animal model, b. longum bs <dig> has a protective role against necrotizing enterocolitis via a sharp decrease of clostridia  <cit> . the two other isolates show differences in their abilities to stimulate the intestinal immune system in gnotobiotic mice by inducing either t-helper  <dig>  or t-helper  <dig> cytokines   <cit> .

genotype comparison using pfge
we first compared the four strains at the genome level using pfge  <cit> . xbai macro-restriction analysis of genomic dna from b. longum strains ncc <dig>  bs <dig>  bs <dig> and bs <dig> generated clear and easy-to-interpret pfge patterns . the four strains exhibited a high degree of genomic heterogeneity and low intraspecies relatedness: bs <dig>  bs <dig> and bs <dig> shared  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> % identity, respectively, with ncc <dig> macrorestriction patterns. such genetic variability is consistent with the comparative genomic analysis of b. longum strains ncc <dig> and djo10a, which showed substantial loss of genome regions, probably due to multiple phage insertion sites  <cit> . considering the various biological effects and genomic heterogeneity of the isolates, one might speculate that this heterogeneity could be related to functional differences that could be identified using proteomic analysis.

comparison of cytosolic protein patterns of the b. longum strains
we next used 2d-electrophoresis to analyze the cytosolic protein content of these four strains. spot differences between the three human isolates, bs <dig>  bs <dig> and bs <dig>  and b. longum ncc <dig> are summarized in table s <dig> . a total of  <dig> spots , representing  <dig> different proteins, were present in some strains and absent in others. the  <dig> proteins fell mainly into the following functional categories:  metabolism-related proteins, especially proteins related to cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis;  proteins involved in nucleotide or amino acid transport and metabolism;  proteins involved in energy production and conversion;  proteins related to transcription and translation. no cluster of orthologous group  proteins, involved in cell control or cell division, showed differences among the four strains; these proteins are over-represented in b. longum ncc <dig>  <cit> . this was not surprising because the bacteria were grown in a rich medium so that stress was minimal. in addition, the proteins in the bifidobacterial shunt pathway, which is a characteristic pathway of the bifidobacterium genus, were well conserved among all strains.

differences in cell wall, membrane and envelope biogenesis proteins in the b. longum strains
of the  <dig> identified proteins, nine were directly or indirectly linked to cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis . five proteins  were directly involved in cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis and include the following: dtdp-4-keto-l-rhamnose reductase/dtdp-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose- <dig> -epimerase , a dtdp-glucose  <dig> -dehydratase  , a glutamine fructose-6-phosphate transaminase  , a udp-galactopyranose mutase   and a carboxyvinyltransferase  . in addition, two of the identified proteins were involved in carbohydrate metabolism, which is important for cell wall biogenesis: a β-galactosidase   and a galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase  . finally, two spots corresponded to proteins indirectly linked to cell wall structure: cyclopropane fatty acid  synthase  and bile salt hydrolase  .

two of these proteins, bl <dig> and bl <dig>  were detected only in the ncc <dig> proteome pattern . these proteins play a role in peptidoglycan biogenesis by producing rhamnose, a polysaccharide component of the bifidobacterium peptidoglycan  <cit> . rhamnose is synthesized by a de novo biosynthetic pathway that starts with dtdp-glucose and leads to the formation of dtdp-l-rhamnose via dehydration and epimerase/reductase reactions mediated by rmlb <dig> dtdp-glucose  <dig> -dehydratase and bl <dig> dtdp-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose- <dig> -epimerase/dtdp-4-keto-l-rhamnose reductase, respectively  <cit>  . these two enzymes are encoded by genes belonging to the same operon, which is located just downstream of a gene coding for a hypothetical transmembrane protein that may be involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis . interestingly, glutamine fructose-6-phosphate transaminase glms  was detected in ncc <dig> as well as in bs <dig>  glms links the d-fructose-6-phosphate shunt of bifidobacteria to the early steps of the de novo amino acid sugar biosynthetic pathway, a pathway that is important for the synthesis of cell wall peptidoglycan precursors.

the proteins mura  and glf  were not detected in the bs <dig> cytosolic proteome. both proteins are involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis. mura is directly linked to the transformation of n-acetylglucosamine in that mura catalyses the first committed step of its incorporation into the peptidoglycan . meanwhile, glf catalyzes the ring contraction of udp-galactopyranose to udp-galactofuranose, which is then used to form the galactofuran structures that are incorporated into the peptidoglycan .

the spot corresponding to β-galactosidase  was present in b. longum ncc <dig> and bs <dig>  but not in strains b. longum bs <dig> and bs <dig>  when grown on lb agar medium supplemented with x-gal, β-galactosidase activity was observed not only in ncc <dig> and bs <dig>  but also in the bs <dig> strain . this suggests that β-galactosidase activity might be repressed in bs <dig> and that bs <dig> may use an enzyme other than bl <dig> to metabolize x-gal. the latter is consistent with the observation that several β-galactosidase-encoding genes are predicted in the b. longum ncc <dig> genome . it is noteworthy that the β-galactosidase lacz is a saccharolytic enzyme, explaining the adaptation of bifidobacterium to its ecological niche, e.g., digestion of complex carbohydrates that escape digestion in the human gastrointestinal tract. in fact, bifidobacterium β-galactosidases show transgalactosylation activity resulting in the production of galacto-oligosaccharides, which are considered prebiotics  <cit> . the protein differences observed between the four strains may thus reflect different sugar utilization mechanisms that might confer different beneficial properties for the host in terms of probiotic and/or prebiotic activity.

the leloir pathway enzyme galt  was observed in bs <dig> and bs <dig>  this enzyme is involved in the udp-glucose and galactose metabolism that links the anabolic pathway of carbohydrate synthesis to cell wall components and to exopolysaccharide synthesis; galactosides are frequently used as building blocks for exopolysaccharides. indeed, udp-galactose is one biosynthetic donor of the galactopyranosyl unit to the galactoconjugates that make up the surface constituents of bacteria, e.g., peptidoglycan   <cit> .

cyclopropane fatty acid  synthase  was detected only in the ncc <dig> strain. interestingly, cfa synthase is directly linked to modifications in the bacterial membrane fatty acid composition that reduce membrane fluidity and helps cells adapt to their environment  <cit> .

proteins with changes in mobility
mass spectrometry analysis revealed that  <dig> spots, representing  <dig> proteins, showed changes in mobility due to charge changes . these proteins included a hypothetical protein of unknown function , a probable udp-galactopyranose mutase  , elongation factor ts , a transcription elongation factor  , an udp-galactopyranose mutase   and the adenylosuccinate lyase . all had pis that clearly differed from corresponding proteins in b. longum ncc <dig>  in addition, four spots were identified as different isoforms of the bsh. however, the post-transcriptional modifications leading to the mobility differences are unknown.

biological variability among b. longum strains
among the  <dig> spots that differed  between the ncc <dig> and bs <dig> proteomes, only  <dig> proteins from bs <dig> had an orthologous gene in ncc <dig>  comparison of the bs <dig> and bs <dig> proteomes to the ncc <dig> proteome showed  <dig> and  <dig> differences, of which  <dig> and  <dig> proteins, respectively, could be identified by comparison to the ncc <dig> genome database. moreover, in bs <dig>  missing spots were identified as enzymes directly or indirectly involved in cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis, as noted above. this suggested that bs <dig> and ncc <dig> might show some biological differences in terms of the cell wall properties. to investigate this hypothesis, we compared the surface hydrophobicity of the four strains and their ability to aggregate; these traits reflect the cell surface properties of the strains  <cit> . interestingly, bs <dig> showed three times more autoaggregation than ncc <dig>  and the surface hydrophobicity of bs <dig> was three times higher than that of ncc <dig> . because autoaggregation and surface hydrophobicity may impact intestinal colonization, these observations suggest that bs <dig> and ncc <dig> may have different adhesion capabilities. it also suggests possible differences in peptidoglycan between the strains, since peptidolycan is the principal constituent of the bacterial outer membrane that directly contacts the surrounding environment. adhesion of bifidobacteria to the gastrointestinal epithelium plays an important role in colonization of the gastrointestinal tract and provides a competitive advantage in the ecosystem against pathogens.

CONCLUSIONS
this study used proteomics to analyze cytosolic proteins extracted from four strains of bifidobacteria grown in a rich laboratory medium. the results validated proteomics as a tool for exploring the natural diversity and biological effects of bifidobacteria. specifically, proteomics allowed identification of phenotype differences in b. longum strains that have different in vitro properties. interestingly, by comparing 2d-electrophoresis patterns and by identifying proteins that were present in some strains but not others, we found that the protein diversity observed between the strains was related to differences in cell wall/membrane biogenesis. in one of the strains , it was associated with better autoaggregation and greater surface hydrophobicity. this strain has been reported to be an inducer of t-helper  <dig> cytokines; in contrast, ncc <dig> had the lowest surface hydrophobicity of the four strains and has been reported to induce t-helper  <dig> cytokines  <cit> . this study showed that proteomic approach may help researchers understand the differential effects of bifidobacteria and be useful for identifying bifidobacteria with probiotic potential.
