BACKGROUND
nontypeable haemophilus influenzae  is responsible for respiratory tract infection and, especially in adults with underlying conditions, invasive disease such as septicemia and meningitis  <cit> . several adherence factors, including hmw1/hmw <dig> proteins, hia, hap and hemaglutinating pili, promote colonization of the upper respiratory tract, a prerequisite for disease  <cit> . whether specific adhesins play or not a role during the dispersion of the microorganism within the respiratory tract or to sterile sites is currently under debate. over the past decade, it has become increasingly evident that bacteria have evolved a number of mechanisms to survive and proliferate in hosts during the different stages of infection by regulating gene expression  <cit> . in almost 80% of nthi clinical isolates, hmw1/hmw <dig> proteins are the major adhesins  <cit> . the hmw <dig> and hmw <dig> proteins are encoded by separate chromosomal loci, hmw <dig> and hmw <dig>  respectively, each containing an hmwa gene, which encodes the structural protein, and two accessory genes, called hmwb and hmwc, encoding proteins involved in processing and surface localization of the hmw adhesins  <cit> . the sequences of the hmw1a and hmw2a genes are identical for the first  <dig>  bp and thereafter partially diverge  <cit> . the hmw <dig> and hmw <dig> proteins exhibit different cellular binding specificities  <cit> . the two different binding domains are localized near the n terminus of the mature proteins in a region of maximal sequence dissimilarity between each other  <cit> . in particular, the  <dig> amino acids between residues  <dig> and  <dig> in mature hmw <dig> and the  <dig> amino acids between residues  <dig> and  <dig> in mature hmw <dig> have been found to be essential for full-level adhesive activity  <cit> . these essential regions have been previously referred to as the hmw <dig> and hmw <dig> core-binding domains and the encoding sequences as the hmw1a and hmw2a core-binding domain sequences  <cit> .

although the hmw adhesins mediate the attachment of the bacterium to human epithelial cells, they also have an important role in human host immunity being a target of naturally acquired human opsonophagocytic antibodies  <cit> . given the importance of hmw adhesins in both nthi pathogenicity and host immune response, they have gained significant potential as nthi vaccine candidates.

analyzing laboratory variants of the wild-type strain  <dig>  dawid and colleagues demonstrated that the expression of hmw <dig> and hmw <dig> adhesins undergo phase variation with an inverse step-wise relationship between the number of  <dig> bp tandem repeats, located in the hmw1a and hmw2a promoters, and the level of protein expression  <cit> . northern blot analysis of transcripts from the strain  <dig> variants carrying different repeat numbers in the hmw2a promoter demonstrated that the amount of the hmw2a gene transcript was maximal in the variant with  <dig> repeats and decreased progressively in variants with increasing number of repeats  <cit> . no further investigations have been reported in the literature on variation in hmw adhesins expression among nthi clinical isolates. in our previous report, we found some invasive nthi isolates containing both hmw1a and hmw2a genes but expressing only one or even no reactive hmw protein  <cit> . in this study, the expression of the hmw1a and hmw2a genes was evaluated by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-pcr  in  <dig> invasive nthi isolates and in the prototype strain  <dig>  moreover, in each isolate, the presence of detectable hmw proteins as well as the number of the repeats within the hmw1a and hmw2a promoters were investigated.

RESULTS
analysis of repeat number within the hmw1a and hmw2a promoters
to determine the exact number of the 7-bp tandem repeats in the hmw1a and hmw2a promoters, amplicons including the hmw1a and hmw2a gene upstream regions were sequenced in each nthi isolate . as shown in table  <dig>  a wide variation in repeat number, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> repeats, was observed. repeat number strongly varied not only among different isolates but also between the hmw1a and hmw2a genes from the same isolate . since variation in repeat number has been reported to occur during growth in vitro  <cit> , several individual colonies for each isolate were analyzed. moreover, each isolate was tested for in vitro stability of the number of repeats within hmwa promoters by sub culturing it up to ten passages and determining the repeat number at both the fifth and tenth passages. a very slight variation in number  was found among original colonies from the same isolate as well as among derivatives from the original colonies . nevertheless the results reported in this study refer to the number of repeats from the same colony used as inoculum for rna purification and qrt-pcr tests.

gene expression analysis by qrt-pcr
the expression of the hmw1a and hmw2a genes was determined by qrt-pcr. data from qrt-pcr experiments were analyzed by relative quantification: the amount of target hmw1a and hmw2a mrna transcripts was normalized to the amount of standard gyra mrna transcript. the relative mrna expression of the hmw1a and hmw2a genes from strains  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and prototype strain  <dig> is shown in fig.  <dig>  compared to the hmw1a mrna transcript from the reference strain  <dig>  both hmw1a and hmw2a transcripts were particularly reduced  in strain  <dig>  which exhibited the highest number of repeats  in both hmw1a and hmw2a promoters. differential expression of the hmw1a and hmw2a genes was found in strain  <dig>  in which the hmw1a transcript was slightly increased whereas the hmw2a transcript was almost threefold less. finally, the expression of the hmw1a transcript appeared up-regulated  in strain  <dig>  although the corresponding promoter contained  <dig> repeats, which is a value close to that found in the hmw1a promoter from the reference strain  <dig> 

hmw protein expression
the presence of hmw-reactive proteins was assessed by western blotting using the 28d rabbit polyclonal antiserum and the 3d <dig> and ad <dig> mabs . since our antisera  cannot distinguish between hmw <dig> and hmw <dig> adhesins , we could only assess the presence/absence of one or two hmw-reactive protein bands detected by each antiserum.

as expected, the prototype strain  <dig> exhibited two hmw protein bands with both 28d antiserum and 3d <dig> mab but a single band with the ad <dig> mab, which, in this isolate, reacts preferentially with hmw <dig>  among our invasive nthi isolates, strain  <dig> showed two reactive bands with all antisera used, confirming the expression of both hmw <dig> and hmw <dig> proteins. strain  <dig> displayed only one reactive band , but the presence of two co-migrating hmw proteins of similar size could not be ruled out. no hmw-reactive band was detected in strain  <dig>  irrespective of the antiserum used, suggesting a low level of expression of both hmw proteins.

discussion
during natural disease in human, h. influenzae is exposed to a variety of environmental conditions, ranging from the nasopharynx to the middle ear or, if invasive disease occurs, to the bloodstream. each hmw-positive nthi isolate actually possesses two different hmwa genes as a result of a gene duplication event that occurred early in its evolution  <cit> . with this picture, it is reasonable to suppose that expression of hmwa genes is modulated during the different stages of disease. although a previous study on variants from the wild-type strain  <dig> demonstrated that expression of the hmw <dig> and hmw <dig> adhesins varies according to the number of 7-bp tandem repeats in the hmw1a and hmw2a promoters  <cit> , no further data evaluating changes in hmw expression among clinical nthi isolates are reported in the literature. in this study, three invasive nthi isolates previously found to possess both hmw1a and hmw2a genes  <cit>  were chosen and analyzed in comparison with the prototype strain  <dig>  to evaluate quantitative expression of hmw1a and hmw2a genes we used qrt-pcr, a highly sensitive method able to accurately measure mrna transcript level. results showed that hmwa genes transcription varied not only among different isolates but also between the hmw1a and hmw2a genes from the same isolate, although variations did not exceed a three or fourfold decrease or increase compared with the hmw1a gene expression measured in the reference strain  <dig>  the hmw1a gene expression was generally higher than that of the hmw2a. analyzing the repeat number within the promoters, the mrna level and the hmw-reactive proteins expressed, we observed that overall expression of the hmwa genes is greatly influenced by the number of repeats within the promoter. the expression was particularly low when the number of repeats was  <dig> or  <dig> , confirming results previously reported  <cit> . in these isolates, the low level of hmwa transcript corresponded to the absence of any hmw-reactive protein by western blotting . although the presence of antigenically variant hmw adhesins, which lacked the epitopes recognized by our mabs, could not be ruled out, the absence of reactivity even with the 28d polyclonal antiserum  suggests that one or both hmw proteins were actually down-modulated in strains  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.

in the study performed by dawid and colleagues, no strain  <dig> variants possessing a number of repeats <  <dig> were found and analyzed  <cit> . in our study, the invasive nthi strains  <dig> and  <dig> were found to contain  <dig> and  <dig> repeats, respectively, within the hmw2a and hmw1a promoters. in these strains, the level of hmwa transcript was either similar  or higher  than that of the strain12/hmw1a reference mrna, indicating that decreasing repeat number below  <dig> does not negatively affect the level of gene expression.

the inverse relationship between increasing number of repeats and the amount of mrna expression  <cit>  was not always confirmed in our nthi isolates: this trend was observed for the hmw2a but not for the hmw1a gene. in fact, strain  <dig> showing, within the hmw1a promoter, two repeats more than strain  <dig> and one repeat less than the reference strain  <dig>  exhibited the highest level of expression of the hmw1a gene, suggesting the presence of additional mechanisms of control contributing to modulation of the transcript level of this gene. further studies are needed to address this point.

the role in pathogenicity of nthi infection of such a fine-tuned modulation of the expression of the hmw adhesins is still not clear. as previously observed by other authors, expression does not switch on or off but involves multiple stages ranging from very weak to very strong, with a series of gradations in between  <cit> . it has been speculated that phase variation mechanism of hmw <dig> and hmw <dig> adhesins plays a fundamental role in enabling the organism to survive in different environments  <cit> . although we analyzed only a few invasive nthi isolates, results of the present study suggest that expression of both hmw proteins is not essential for bacterial survival in sterile sites, since two of the three isolates tested had at least one down-regulated hmw adhesin. actually, inspection of the hmw1a and hmw2a promoter regions of other  <dig> invasive nthi isolates from our collection seemed to confirm this hypothesis since  <dig> out of  <dig> possessed a high number of repeats  in both hmwa promoters,  <dig> isolates contained a high number of repeats in at least one hmwa promoter and only  <dig> had a number of repeats close to  <dig>  in both hmwa promoters . monitoring of hmwa gene expression in vivo could provide insight into the actual role of the hmw adhesins in the different phases of invasive nthi infection, being this issue of great interest in view of the potential use of these adhesins as vaccine components. on the other hand, it is well known that both hypervariable expression and heterogeneity of surface antigens are tools used by microorganisms to evade host defenses. according to previous data, hmwa genes are characterized by a high level of polymorphism in the receptor binding domains that are surface exposed and subject to selective pressure  <cit> . variable expression of hmw adhesins provides a further mechanism to escape host immune system.

CONCLUSIONS
to conclude, our study demonstrates for the first time a variation in expression of the hmwa genes in clinical nthi isolates other than the prototype strain  <dig> and confirms that increasing number of 7-bp repeats within hmwa promoters generally correlates with decreasing levels of mrna transcript. however, the results herein reported also suggest that additional mechanisms of control may contribute to regulation of hmw protein expression, especially in modulating the transcript level of the hmw1a gene. further studies aimed to identify environmental conditions able to influence the hmwa genes transcript profiles both in vitro and during natural nthi infection are needed.
