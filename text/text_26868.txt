BACKGROUND
the emergence of highly pathogenic viral agents from zoonotic reservoirs has energized a wave of research into viral ecology, viral discovery  <cit>  and a parallel drive to develop large datasets of complete viral genomes for the study of viral evolution and pandemic prediction  <cit> . viral discovery has been aided by the development of sequence independent methodologies for the generation of genomic data  <cit> . the most prominent of these methodologies include representational difference analysis  and sequence independent single primer amplification  with several variations. the sispa method, first developed by reyes and kim  <cit> , entails the directional ligation of an asymmetric primer at either end of a blunt-ended dna molecule. following several cycles of denaturation, annealing and amplification, minute amounts of the initial dna are enriched and then cloned, sequenced and analyzed. several modifications of the sispa method have so far been implemented including random-pcr   <cit> . the rpcr method combines reverse transcription primed with an oligonucleotide made up of random hexamers tagged with a known sequence which is subsequently used as a primer-binding extension sequence. this initial modification was first used to construct a whole cdna library from low amounts of viral rna. a more recent modification, the dnase-sispa technique  <cit> , includes steps to detect both rna and dna sequences. combining sample filtration through a  <dig>  micrometer column and a dnase i digestion step led to the identification of viruses from clinical samples. the dnase-sispa technique has been used for the detection of novel bovine and human viruses from screens of clinical samples  <cit> . other groups have used the protocol for the characterization of common epitopes in enterovirus  <cit> , for the identification of a novel human coronavirus  <cit>  and for viral discovery in the plasma of hiv infected patients  <cit> .

in addition to its utility for viral discovery and viral surveillance, the dnase-sispa method has utility in obtaining full genome sequence from uncharacterized viral isolates or viral isolates from highly divergent families. in this study, we demonstrate the utility of the sispa method and its use as a rapid and cost effective method for generating full genome coverage of a wide range of viral types from several sources.

RESULTS
optimization of the sispa method for whole genome sequencing
given the success of earlier efforts for the identification of novel viral nucleic acids using sispa, we sought to adapt and optimize this method as a general and cost effective technique for large scale de novo viral genome sequencing . an rnase treatment step was added to the sispa protocol to reduce contaminating exogenous rnas such as ribosomal rnas. in the case of polya-tailed viruses, we perform reverse transcription using a combination of random  and poly t tagged  primers in order to increase the coverage of the 3' end . additionally, in order to capture 5' ends of viral rna, a random hexamer primer tagged with a conserved sequence at the 5' end was added to the klenow reaction .

viral genome assembly metrics
we have successfully used the sispa method on viral samples from different viral types. in this paper we discuss seven representative samples . we have found that the method works consistently on dsdna, ssdna, ssrna positive and ssrna negative viruses. we have also found that the method can result in complete genome sequence of viruses ranging in size from  <dig> – <dig>  kb in a single experimental procedure. figure  <dig> shows the sequence coverage obtained for three viruses: positive ssrna phage ms <dig>  positive ssrna rhinovirus and negative ssrna newcastle disease virus .

one parameter that is taken into consideration when designing an efficient protocol for construction of a sequence library is the number of independent colonies needed to obtain sequence coverage of a given reference genome. experiments were conducted using m <dig> , ndv , and lambda phage  to compare the level of coverage obtained by bidirectional sequencing of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> clones . for m <dig>  94% genome coverage was achieved from sequencing one  <dig> well block of clones, and 97% genome coverage was obtained from two  <dig> well blocks. for ndv,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % sequence coverage were obtained from one, two or three  <dig> well blocks respectively. in contrast to m <dig> and ndv, the coverage for lambda was  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % after one two and three  <dig> well blocks were sequenced

the efficiency of the sispa method as a tool for obtaining full genome coverage was analyzed using the lander and waterman model  <cit> , which estimates the number of gaps present as a function of sequence number and genome size. table  <dig> compares the expected coverage and redundancy  as predicted by the lander-waterman model with the observed genome coverage and redundance. with the exception of lambda phage, observed coverage and redundancy approach expected coverage and redundancy.

observed coverage and redundancy was compared with the expected coverage and redundancy as predicted by the lander-waterman model for the total number of sequences in each assembly.

however when taking into account the scaled difference, as described by wendl  <cit> , we see a dramatically increased "shortfall" between actual and expected coverage as more clones are sequenced. for example, in the case of ndv which has a genome size of  <dig> kb, the scaled difference d between the expected coverage and the observed coverage  at the different levels of sequence redundancy is  <dig>  for the sequencing of a plate of  <dig> clones,  <dig>  for two plates and  <dig>  for three plates.

the sispa method works efficiently on viruses purified from a number of sources and by several methods. enterobacteriophages m <dig>  ms <dig>  and lambda were isolated from bacterial growth media and plasma after concentration by density gradient centrifugation. woodchuck hepatitis virus was purified from plasma by cesium chloride gradient centrifugation. human rhinovirus  <dig>  purchased as a cell culture supernatant from atcc, was subjected to a low speed spin to remove cellular debris. turkey astrovirus was isolated from fecal material collected from turkey poults showing clinical signs of diarrhea. the intestinal fecal content was diluted in pbs and centrifuged at  <dig>  k before filtration and nuclease treatment. newcastle disease virus rna was purified from allantoic fluids derived from inoculated eggs.

to determine the number of viral particles necessary to generate full genome sequences, we conducted dilution series with viruses whose titer was determined by plaque assays. the results of these experiments demonstrate that the sispa method is very efficient as a genome sequencing method for samples with greater than  <dig> viral particles per rt-pcr reaction . below  <dig> particles, the specific viral signal is overwhelmed by competition with non-specific or host sequences and is rarely detected from sequencing two blocks  of colonies.

resolution of 3' and 5' ends
our initial results indicated low sequence coverage at the 3' and 5' ends of most viral genomes. in order to address this problem in viruses with polya tails the fr40rv-t primer  is added to the rt reaction. this increases the number of cdnas produced at the 3' end of the genome, and results in a much greater depth of coverage at the 3' end. the polyt containing primer is added to the rt reaction at a concentration  <dig> fold lower than the random primer in order to reduce competition with the random primer.

we used human rhinoviruses to develop the methodology for improving the coverage of the 5' end. we took advantage of a conserved region from nucleotide  <dig> to nucleotide  <dig> in the 5' untranslated region. the conserved primer was used in the klenow step of the sispa protocol to enrich for the presence of amplicons from the 5' end. when used in combination with the 3' primer, we have been able to obtain full rhinovirus genome coverage in a  <dig> clone experiment .

contaminant sequences
one inherent difficulty of a method that relies on a random reverse transcription and pcr to generate amplicons for sequencing is the likelihood of detecting contaminant sequences as well as sequences of interest. although filtration and nuclease treatment does reduce the presence of nucleic acids from whole cells and host chromosomes, contaminating rna species will inevitably remain and thus be amplified .

sequences were analyzed against a non redundant database using a blastn algorithm. viral specific sequences were identified as matching the reference genome with a blastn cut off below 10- <dig>  non-specific  sequences were identified if they had a cut off value below 10- <dig>  while none means that no blastn results were found below the 10- <dig> cut off value.

to determine the presence of contaminant sequences in the clone population, all generated sequences were subjected to a blastn search against the ncbi  database. a cutoff e value of 10- <dig> was used to identify viral sequences which matched the reference genome. non-specific sequences  were identified as mammalian, avian, bacterial, etc., if their best hit was below a cut off value of  <dig> - <dig>  if no blast results were found below the  <dig> - <dig> cut off value the sequences were not given a specific designation. in experiments resulting in nearly complete genome sequences, contaminant sequences ranged from 3–40%. the nature of the contaminant sequence depended on the initial viral host and included mammalian, avian, bacterial, fungal, viral and unknown sequences. in the case of rhinoviruses, which were purified from hela cell culture, the majority of contaminant was of derived from human or mycobacterial nucleic acids. newcastle  and astrovirus  which were purified from chicken egg allantoic fluid and turkey feces, respectively, were contaminated primarily with nucleic acids of avian origin. table  <dig> shows the results of blast analyses of two samples, ta and hrv <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
the work presented here demonstrates the utility of the random genome sequencing method for the generation of viral sequence from positive strand ssrna  and negative strand ssrna viruses , ssdna  and dsdna viruses . in addition, using the dnase i-sispa technique we were able to amplify sufficient target material for sequencing from various sources, including cell culture isolates and field isolates which have not been purified by ultracentrifugation. although ultracentrifugation is an efficient procedure to purify viruses, it is not practical for processing samples of relatively low viral titer in a small volume or high throughput processing of viral samples for genomic sequencing.

genome coverage and redundancy for viral samples from 3– <dig> kb approach the ideal values as predicted by the lander-waterman model  <cit> . however, as the sequence number increases, the efficiency of the method as measured by the scaled difference  <cit>  decreases dramatically. thus, while the number of gaps declines as more clones are sequenced, the efficiency is reduced  per viral sample for bidirectional sequencing as this represents the most affordable sequence coverage to efficiency ratio. while significant coverage is obtained from a single experiment, final genome assembly requires varying levels of targeted rt-pcrs to close the genome .

the 3' end of the virus generally has the lowest coverage in any use of this protocol. in theory, given the directionality of the reverse transcriptase  and assuming an equal distribution of binding sites for the random primer, the 5' end of any viral genome will get higher depth of sequence coverage than the 3' end. we have found that addition of a tagged oligo dt primer significantly reduces this problem for viruses with polya tails , but this remains a limitation for other virus genome types. the 5' end of most viruses has also proved difficult to complete and we have found that the addition to the rt reaction of degenerate oligos based on conserved 5' sequences can increase coverage. however we have not been able to develop a universally applicable method for obtaining complete 5' coverage. we strongly anticipate that specific adaptations of the sispa method to conserved regions of different viruses will demonstrate its versatility in a wide range of viral genome sequencing initiatives.

limitations to the method include the need for samples containing a minimum of  <dig> particles . moreover because the capsid structure renders the viral genomes nuclease-resistant, this protocol requires encapsidated viral genomes to allow the removal of most extra-viral contaminants. the viral nucleic acids in samples whose capsid structures have been disrupted cannot be separated from contaminants, and therefore cannot be efficiently amplified by sispa. in the experiments discussed in this paper dnase i was used to reduce host contaminant. for samples with high levels of host nucleic acid contaminant, we have used  <dig> μg of rnase a to treat  <dig> μl of filtered virus for  <dig> hr. we have found that rnase a treatment eliminates the majority of host rna derived sequence contaminant in these cases.

the sispa method is particularly useful for obtaining genome sequence from rna viruses. because most sequencing methods for rna viruses depend on rt-pcr with primers designed from pre-existing sequence data, the utility of this protocol is particularly evident for highly variable or degenerate viral families or for viruses with little available sequence information. in addition, the sispa method will be useful for uncharacterized viruses as no prior sequence information is required.
