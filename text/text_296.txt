BACKGROUND
advances in next-generation sequencing technologies have driven the development of computational approaches to address the problem of aligning short reads to reference genomes  <cit> . even so, the alignment problem remains challenging due to the presence of genomic repeats that are much longer than reads. yu et al.  <cit>  evaluated alignment performance of several aligners on repetitive regions selected from cpg islands and concluded that long repeats seriously degraded alignment performance.

researchers generally believe that the difficulty of aligning short reads is very much related to the complexity of genomes; it is easier to misalign short reads when the genomes of interest have long and complicated repeat patterns. while there has been an interest in measuring complexity of strings, recent attention has been focused on complexity of dna sequences  <cit> . whiteford et al.  <cit>  utilized k-mer frequencies as a way to visualize and understand the complexity of genomes. kurtz et al.  <cit> , similarly, annotated plant genomes with k-mer frequencies so that repeat structures and characteristics can be easily visualized. with the same approach to understanding genome complexity, chor et al.  <cit>  analyzed k-mer spectra of over  <dig> species and observed multimodal spectra for regions with specific cg content characteristics. unfortunately, these measures cannot be easily quantified and immediately adopted to study how complexity affects the difficulty of short-read alignment.

in a recent study, becher et al.  <cit>  introduced a measure known as the i-complexity, which seems most promising as a tool to correlate sequence complexity to difficulty of short-read alignment. the authors showed several interesting properties of this measure, including its closeness to the lempel-ziv complexity and its efficient computation in linear time. the i-complexity can be easily adopted for our purpose and will be used among others to understand how genome complexity affects the difficulty of short-read alignment.

in this paper, we propose measures of complexity that are best suited for the analysis and understanding of the difficulty of short-read alignment and how such measures might be helpful in selecting appropriate aligners for new genomes. the inspiration for this work lies in the observation that complex repeat structures in dna that affect the performance of computational tasks are length specific. for instance, in finding regulatory motifs in dna sequences, repeated structures of interest are around 8- <dig> characters long. on the other hand, in aligning reads to genomes, such repeats probably have little effect on the performance of aligners. this means that measures such as the i-complexity that are general and not length-specific might not be best.

methods
i-complexity and d-complexity
becher et al.  <cit>  introduced the i-complexity as a measure of complexity of strings. it is proportional to the number of distinct substrings of the input string. specifically, the i-complexity of a dna sequence g is defined to be:

 i= ∑i=1|g|log4-log <dig> 

where lcp  is the length of the longest common prefix of the suffixes of g starting at positions s and at s, and s is the suffix array of g. the suffix array s of g stores implicitly lexicographically sorted suffixes of g; i.e. for i < j, gs···|g|  is lexicographically smaller than gs···|g| .

the somewhat non-intuitive definition of the i-complexity has some advantages. the authors established upper and lower bounds for i, and showed that it was close to the lempel-ziv complexity of g. further, it can be computed in linear time because the suffix and lcp arrays can be constructed in linear time  <cit> .

although the i-complexity will be used in our attempt to explore the relationship between complexity and difficulty of alignment, we introduce a similar measure, d, counts directly the rate of distinct substrings:

 d=2⋅|{x : f>0}||g|⋅ 

where f denotes the number of occurrences of x in g. to be precise, d is equal to the total number of distinct substrings divided by the total number of substrings of g. d can be computed in linear time, due to the following lemma.

lemma  <dig> |{x:f>0}|= ∑i=1|g|i-∑i=1|g|lcp

proof suppose that a substring s of g occurs exactly k times. then, there will be a block of size k in the suffix array that corresponds to k suffixes that have s as the common prefix. more specifically, assume that s is the common prefix of the suffixes of g starting at positions s,s,⋯,s. we will call the occurrence of s at position s its representative occurrence, and its occurrences at s,s,⋯,s its repeat occurrences.

each repeat occurrence of s is a prefix of the longest common prefix of the suffixes starting at s,s,⋯,s. this means, each repeat occurrence of s is accounted for uniquely by the values of lcp,lcp,⋯,lcp.

if we focus on a position, for example i +  <dig>  we can see that the longest common prefix between s and s  accounts uniquely for j repeat occurrences, namely p <dig> p1⋯ <dig> ⋯,p1⋯. one of these is s; the rest are repeat occurrences of other substrings. thus, each repeat occurrence is accounted for uniquely in some entry of lcp and each entry of lcp accounts uniquely for some repeat occurrences. that implies that  ∑i=1|g|lcp accounts for the total repeat occurrences of all substrings of g.

further,  ∑i=1|g|i is the total number of substrings of g, since there are exactly i substrings starting at position i. thus, if we remove all repeat occurrences from the total number of substrings, we will get precisely the total number of representative occurrences. this means |{x:f>0}|= ∑i=1|g|-∑i=1|g|lcp.

length-sensitive measures of complexity
in addition to the i and d, we introduce two notions of length-sensitive measures of genome complexity. the motivation is that, depending on which computational tasks that are affected by the complexity of genomes, only a narrow range of repeat lengths play an important role; for instance, one would expect repeats that affect the finding of regulatory motifs to be much shorter than those that affect the alignment reads to genomes. given a number k, we define dk and rk as follows:

 dk=|{x : f> <dig> |x|=k}||g|-k+ <dig> 

 rk=∑f> <dig> |x|=kf|g|-k+ <dig> 

where f  is the number of occurrences of x in g. dk and rk measure the rates of distinct substrings and repeats, respectively, of length k. rk and dk are not exact "opposites" because rk does not account for non-repeats, whereas dk does. rk is related to the function c proposed by whiteford et al.  <cit> . c is the count of k-mers repeating exactly r times. therefore, rk= ∑r>1r⋅c. dk and rk can be computed in linear time and space using suffix and lcp arrays.

lemma  <dig> |{x:f> <dig> |x|=k}|=|{j:s≤|g|-k+1andlcp<k}|

proof a k-substring of g must start at an index between  <dig> and |g|-k + <dig>  further, if lcp  <k, the k-prefix of the suffix starting at s is different from the k-prefix of the suffix starting at s. thus, each j for which s ≤ |g| - k +  <dig> and lcp  <k represents exactly one distinct k-substring.

on the other hand, if s > |g|-k+ <dig> or lcp  ≥ k, then the k-substring starting at s does not exist or is not distinct. since lcp runs through all positions of g, all distinct k-substrings are uniquely accounted for.

lemma  <dig>  ∑f> <dig> |x|=kf= ∑|i,j|∈ik, where ik is the set of intervals 's, where i ≤ j, such that

 <dig> lcp  ≥ k for i ≤ u ≤ j

 <dig> lcp  <k unless i = 1

 <dig> lcp  <k unless j = |g|

proof a k-repeat is a substring x of length k, with f  > <dig>  since the suffix array s is sorted lexicographically, s forms consecutive runs of k-repeats, which are k-prefixes of the suffixes stored implicitly by s. more specifically, each interval  ∈ ik corresponds to all occurrences of exactly one k-repeat. the number of occurrences for each k-repeat is exactly j - i +  <dig> 

ik can be computed in linear time by scanning the lcp array once. note that the index of lcp runs from  <dig> to |g|, and lcp  <cit>  =  <dig> 

relating genome complexity to difficulty of aligning short reads to genomes
i, d, dk , and rk provide quantitative measures of complexity for each genome. intuitively, the more distinct substrings a reference genome has , the easier to align reads to the reference genome. conversely, the more long repeats the genome has, the more difficult to align reads to it correctly 

we measure the performance of an alignment algorithm using precision and recall, where precision is defined as the fraction of aligned reads that are correct ; and recall is defined as the fraction of reads that are correctly aligned . these definitions were also used by liu et al.  <cit> .

to correlate complexity values to difficulty of alignment, for each measure of complexity, we computed the linear correlation between the complexity values of sequences in a diverse data set including  <dig> genomic sequences, and the actual performance for each of  <dig> popular aligners. a good measure of complexity will correlate highly with alignment performance.

RESULTS
aligners and genomic data
we selected from ncbi and embl-ebi databases a total of  <dig> genomic sequences from bacteria, plants, and eukaryotes  with diverse complexity. detail information of these sequences is described in tables  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  "n" bases were removed from these genomic sequences because they were not real contents and constituted false long repeats that inappropriately affected the true complexity of the genomes.

we selected  <dig> popular short-read aligners that employ different algorithmic techniques and indexing structures: shrimp <dig>  <cit> , mrfast  <cit> , seqalto  <cit> , gassst  <cit> , bowtie <dig>  <cit> , bwa-sw  <cit> , soap <dig>  <cit> , cushaw <dig>  <cit> , masai  <cit> , and smalt  <cit> .

we used default parameters to run these programs because these aligners appeared to perform well and consistent over the  <dig> genomes at such settings.

it is not possible to compute the number of correctly aligned reads for real reads because positions of real reads in reference genomes are not known. consequently, precision and recall cannot be computed using real reads. for this reason, we simulated reads for each genome, 2x coverage of reads at lengths  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> using the wgsim program  <cit> . reads were generated with default parameters; sequencing error rates equal to  <dig> %, 1%, 2%, and mutation rates between  <dig> % and 1%, of which 15% are indels. these parameters should be sufficiently realistic for the current sequencing technologies and a large range of organisms.

overview performance of aligners
in terms of precision and recall, the average performance over  <dig> genomic sequences for read lengths  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> is summarized in table  <dig>  all aligners were generally very accurate and increasingly so at longer read lengths. on average, cushaw <dig>  masai, and smalt performed consistently well across read lengths 50- <dig>  whereas bowtie <dig>  bwa-sw and seqalto performed equally well at read lengths 75- <dig>  but were slightly inferior at read length  <dig>  strictly based on numbers, shrimp <dig> had very good accuracy , but for larger genomes, it ran very slow. performance of gassst seemed peculiar with some recall values larger than  <dig>  this is possible if a read is aligned to multiple locations by the aligner and counted as correct more than once by the samtool evaluation package, which allows a gap  between predicted and actual read positions.

in brief, many of these aligners  performed similarly accurately on the tested  <dig> genomes. without additional information, it can be difficult to decide between these high-performing aligners. it would be useful if we could predict how accurately they perform on new genomes. to explore the aligners' performance on new genomes, we will examine the correlation between various measures of genome complexity and alignment accuracy.

correlation between genome complexity and alignment performance
our experiments showed that an appropriate choice of length-sensitive measure of complexity correlated highly with short-read performance of most aligners across read lengths, rates of mutation and sequencing error. figures  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> show the correlation between complexity measures dk, rk, d, i and alignment performance  at read lengths  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively, for the  <dig> genomes. we see that the d-complexity surprisingly had no correlation to performance across all aligners. the i-complexity  had better but still very low correlation, with correlation coefficients between  <dig> and - <dig> .

we can see that there is a value of k for which dk that correlated highly with performance for both precision and recall, across all read lengths of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  for most aligners, the correlation coefficients were approximately  <dig> . the only noticeable exception is for gassst whose correlation coefficients were comparatively lower than those of the others. we think the explanation for this is in gassst's peculiar performance as we reported earlier, whereby its recalls were above  <dig> for many of the  <dig> genomes. additionally, we could see that when recalls were comparative lower for mrfast and bwa-sw at read length  <dig>  their correlations were also comparative lower than the other aligners'. it is important to note that some aligners were designed to work optimally with longer reads and consequently do not work very well with shorter reads. one can conclude that if aligners perform predictably in their comfort zones, dk , is a good complexity measure that correlates highly to the accuracy of aligning reads to genomes.

a close examination of the results shows that the value of k for which dk correlated highest with performance was very close to the read length. for example, at read length  <dig>  d <dig> had the highest correlations across aligners; at both read lengths  <dig> and  <dig>  d <dig> had the highest correlations, although d <dig> also had very high correlations at read length  <dig>  thus, the most accurate measure of complexity to understand the difficulty of short-read alignment is length sensitive. intuitively, this is because repeats of length close to  <dig>  for example, influence the accuracy of the alignment of reads of length  <dig> 

the fact that the best value of k is less than or equal to read length, and not larger than it implies that dk accounts for approximate repeats. to see this, observe that a 75-mer repeat might not be part of a 100-mer, but surely contains several 50-mer repeats . this means that d <dig> neglects to account for several 50-mers, whereas d <dig> accounts for all of these, and these 50-mer repeats directly have an influence of the accuracy of aligning reads of length  <dig>  this is probably why d <dig> had a better correlation profile to complexity than d <dig> did. the fact that dk accounts for approximate repeats longer than k can be explained formally by the so-called q-gram lemma, which states that two sequences of length k with edit distance e share at least n - q +  <dig> - qe q-grams. an estimate of complexity involving counting approximate repeats might give better correlation. however, the computing of approximate repeats is computational expensive compared to linear time computation of dk. the best computation of approximate repeats we know of using a lossless filter  <cit>  has an average running time of o. for long genomes, this running time is not desirable. since dk and rk already correlated quite highly  for many aligners, a more efficient running time  seemed to be a better trade-off than a potentially better correlation.

at different rates of sequencing error and mutation, respectively, we observed similarly high correlation between performance of the aligners and length-sensitive measures of complexity. to study the correlation at different rates of sequencing error and mutation rates, respectively, we chose to correlate d <dig> and alignment performance on reads of length  <dig>  this case is representative for the correlation between the most appropriate length-sensitive measure and aligners' performance at a given read length. figure  <dig> and  <dig> show the correlation between d <dig> and aligners' performance of aligning reads of length  <dig> at different sequencing error rates and different mutation rates, respectively. across all rates of sequencing error and mutation, the correlation between precision of all aligners and d <dig> ranged from high to very high. the lowest correlation was obtained for gassst at about  <dig> . correlations for the other aligners were around  <dig> . similarly, the correlation between recall and d <dig> was also high for almost all aligners. overall, compared to precision, recall was, however, not as highly correlated. this might be explained by some aligners' conservative strategies, which aim to make few false positive alignments at the expense of making more false negatives. further, as expected, at higher rates of sequencing error and mutation, respectively, correlation between performance and complexity decreased. although, this decrease in correlation is affected more by increasing sequencing errors and by increasing mutations.

predicting aligner performance for unknown genomes
the existence of many short-read aligners makes it challenging for researchers to pick the best one for their genomes of interest. surveys such as  <cit>  compared popular software packages on a few known genomes and served as a good starting point. but when it comes to adopt a particular software package, the decision seems to be a mixture of many factors including the authors' reputation, past familiarity with the software, its alignment accuracy, its quality and ease of use, its resource usage , and recommendations of fellow researchers. our focus is on accuracy, defined in terms of precision and recall.

to predict accuracy of a particular aligner on unknown genomes, researchers currently rely on its accuracy on known genomes. such prediction can be based on summary statistics such as the top figure in figure  <dig>  this figure shows precisions and recalls of the aligners across  <dig> genomes in a boxplot figure, which shows medians, interquartile ranges among other statistics. considering both statistics on precision and recall, we can see that with the exception of mrfast and soap <dig> , the rest of the aligners had similar precisions and recalls across the  <dig> genomes. while the aligners' performance appeared similar on known genomes, what remains uncertain is, however, how well they perform on new genomes.

to remove this uncertainty and make more informed decisions, we might additionally incorporate correlation between genome complexity and accuracy. to illustrate this strategy, consider the bottom figure in figure  <dig> shows the correlation between d <dig>  of the aligners' precision and recall across the  <dig> genomes. comparing the performance of the high-performing aligners identified in the previous step , we can see that they have different levels of correlations. for instance, bowtie <dig> had noticeably lower correlations  than cushaw <dig> for both precision and recall). thus, although bowtie <dig> and cushaw <dig> had similar accuracies for the  <dig> genomes, we expect that cushaw <dig> will more likely have similar accuracies for unknown genomes.

the effect of k on dk and rk
measures dk and rk are length specific and may have different characteristics for different values of k. figure  <dig> shows the cumulative distributions of dk and rk with k =  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  we can see that the distributions of dk and rk are similar, but in an opposite fashion. for d <dig> or r <dig>  the distribution of complexity of the  <dig> genomes is quite uniform across the range from  <dig> to  <dig>  with k >  <dig>  however, the distribution is quite non-uniform. as k becomes larger, the distribution of dk  becomes much more concentrated toward  <dig> .

the transition from near-uniform distributions of d <dig>  to very skewed distributions of dk , for k ≥  <dig>  might explain for the low correlation of d <dig>  to alignment accuracy. thus, we can stipulate that right choice of k is essential for correlating complexity and alignment accuracy. the right choice of k appears to be similar to read length as we have observed.

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated that length sensitive measures were suitable for studying how genome complexity affected the of short-read alignment. this work has implications for theoretical studies of genome complexity, as well as for comparing alignment methods, and designing cost-effective experiments to assemble genomes. beyond short-read alignment, these measures should be useful for problems such as short-read assembly, which are affected by genomic repeats.

this method depends on the simulation of reads with known alignment locations, from which we can compute the number of correctly aligned reads for the calculation of precision and recall. with real reads, we cannot know this information. better simulation of reads will improve the predictive power of this method.
