BACKGROUND
toll-like receptors  are a major class of pattern recognition receptors  in drosophila and in mammals. mammalian tlrs have essential roles in recognizing infectious agents and initiating intracellular signal transduction pathways that trigger the expression of genes leading to both innate and adaptive immune responses  <cit> . tlrs belong to the type i transmembrane glycoprotein receptor family and can be expressed either in the cell surface or membrane compartments of immune and non-immune cells   <cit> .

thirteen tlrs have been identified to date of which  <dig> members are present in the human genome  and thirteen in rodents   <cit> . according to their structure, phylogenetic position and class of microbial compound that they recognize, vertebrate tlrs can be classified into six subfamilies: the tlr <dig> subfamily encompasses tlr <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 10; the tlr <dig> subfamily includes tlr <dig>   <dig> and 9; tlr <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> constitute the subfamily tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> each form a subfamily  <cit> . tlrs can be also classified into non-viral  and viral tlrs  with respect to their ligand recognition  <cit> .

the tlr family is structurally characterized by the presence of an ectodomain, a signal transmembrane segment and a highly conserved cytoplasmic domain homologous to the human interleukin- <dig> receptor  and human il- <dig> receptor  and designated tir domain  <cit> . crystallographic studies of the ectodomain revealed a solenoid horseshoe-like structure constituted by a high but variable number  of leucine-rich repeats  responsible for binding the "pathogen associated molecular patterns" . pamps are present in pathogens and not in host components, thus allowing the innate immune system to distinguish between what is self and what is non-self  <cit> . nevertheless, tlrs not only sense microbial components but they can also target endogenous molecules that have resulted from host dying cells and which can activate the inflammatory response  <cit> . pamps are characteristic molecular signatures of the pathogens, highly conserved during evolution since they are involved in critical functions and are essential for survival of the pathogens. indeed, mutations or loss of these patterns can be lethal to the pathogens and therefore are quite conserved  <cit> . this means that a limited number of prrs is needed to detect the presence of an infection  <cit> . their main recognition molecules, the lrrs, are capped in the amino and carboxy termini by lrr-nt and lrr-ct molecules, respectively  <cit> , that stabilize the protein structure by protecting the hydrophobic core from exposure to solvent  <cit> . delimitation of these domains is, however, not consensual among the different software programs used for their determination  <cit> . for some tlrs crystallographic models have been made available where these domains are well defined . however, this is not the case for all species which further complicates the correct delimitation of each domain.

upon pamps recognition, tlrs dimerize leading to the recruitment of the adaptor proteins  and triggering signaling pathways of the innate immune response . tlr1/tlr <dig> and tlr2/tlr <dig> exist as heterodimers on the cell surface and detect bacterial triacylated and diacylated lipoproteins, respectively  <cit> . also on the cell surface, tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> detect lipopolysaccharide  and bacterial flagellin, correspondingly  <cit> . tlr <dig> seems to heterodimerize with tlr <dig> to also recognize triacyl lipoproteins  <cit> . on the other hand, tlr <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are expressed on endosomes and detect microbial nucleic acids  <cit>  with tlr <dig> being associated with the recognition of double-strand rna   <cit> , while tlr <dig> and  <dig> target viral components such as single-strand rna  and tlr <dig> respond to double-strand dna viruses  and bacteria by recognizing non-methylated cpg-containing dna  <cit> .

tlrs are evolutionary conserved proteins and their characterization and of their ligands has contributed to the understanding of the function of the tlrs and to the host defense processes against infections  <cit> . they are candidate molecules to examine how natural selection molds innate immunity receptors. several studies have been performed and purifying selection was suggested as the major force driving tlrs evolution, at least in humans  <cit> . however, other studies on primate species revealed different degrees of positive selection acting on their evolutionary history. evidence of positive selection was found in tlr <dig>  <cit>  and tlr <dig>  <cit> . in a broader study in a primate group, wlasiuk and nachman  showed evidence of positive selection in six tlr genes, tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  with the non-viral tlr <dig> having the highest number of positively selected codons . a study performed by alcaide and edwards  in birds showed evidence of positive selection in tlr <dig>  the most recent analysis of the tlr <dig> subfamily showed evidence of positive selection in tlr <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in mammals and tlr2a/b in birds  <cit> . overall, these studies also showed that non-viral tlrs tend to be more prone to positive selection than viral tlrs. from an evolutionary point of view, proteins involved in direct recognition of pathogens might have been shaped by these interactions. here, we have studied ten mammal tlr genes in order to look for evidence of positive selection and to further clarify if viral and non-viral tlrs display different patterns of molecular evolution due to the different nature of the pamps they recognize.

RESULTS
signatures of positive selection
genes of the immune system, in particular those involved in the recognition of pathogens, and genes involved in the host-pathogen interaction have been shown to be highly prone to adaptive selection . by using maximum-likelihood  approaches, evidence of positive selection was detected in all the tlrs studied . for seven of the tlrs , analyses included species belonging to some of the most representative mammalian groups, i.e. artiodactyla, rodents, carnivores, lagomorphs and primates, while for the remaining three tlrs, the lagomorph group was not included due to the lack of data .

the number of positively selected codons observed for each tlr studied ranged between 2- <dig> which corresponded to  <dig> %- <dig> % of codons under positive selection. the non-viral tlr <dig> was the receptor with the highest proportion of psc , followed by the viral tlr <dig> . description of the amino acids present in each species for each site under positive selection and their location in the receptors can be found in additional file  <dig>  table s11; additional file  <dig>  table s12; additional file  <dig>  table s13; additional file  <dig>  table s14; additional file  <dig>  table s15; additional file  <dig>  table s16; additional file  <dig>  table s17; additional file  <dig>  table s18; additional file  <dig>  table s19; additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  previous studies argued that viral tlrs are under a stronger purifying selection than non-viral tlrs  <cit>  since viral tlrs recognize viral nucleic acids but also target self components  <cit> . therefore, these tlrs have the dual role of maintaining their function and avoid autoimmunity, and so they are not expected to accumulate non-synonymous substitutions as this might affect their functional integrity. on the other hand, non-viral tlrs that exist on the cell surface have a more flexible evolution and easily tolerate non-synonymous mutations which, in some circumstances, can be subject to positive selection and become fixed in some populations  <cit> . this higher tolerance is because the function of non-viral tlrs is more redundant than of viral tlrs. indeed, several surface tlrs are able to recognize the same bacteria and fungi components, so one microorganism can be recognized by different tlrs. therefore, a non-synonymous mutation in one tlr does not necessarily mean the extinction of the function and does not compromise immunity  <cit> .

the viral tlr <dig> has never been identified as a candidate for being under positive selection; however, our results indicate a similar level of positive selection acting in tlr <dig> as in the non-viral tlr <dig>  this might be the result of the inclusion of a larger group of species that might be affected by different pathogens with implications in their pamps recognition. indeed, the groups previously analyzed by others are homogeneous probably being affected by only a restricted number of related viruses which accounts for their conservation. in addition, the presence of the positive selection signature may not mean a recent event but could result from ancient functional adaptations from each species that lead to the actual taxon specificities  <cit> . furthermore, as the recognition of viral rna is essential for host defense, the mutations that could affect the function should have been removed by purifying selection and then, only the polymorphisms that are advantageous, i.e. that confer resistance to the pathogen, might have become fixed and are now reflected in the differences between species  <cit> .

the high number of psc observed in the non-viral tlr <dig> is in line with results previously reported in primates and birds  <cit> . tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> recognize very different ligands. for pamps recognition, tlr <dig> forms a homodimer that is associated with response to ssrna viruses while the tlr4-md- <dig> heterodimer mostly recognizes lps that are present in the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . in addition, tlr <dig> also targets components of yeast, trypanossoma and even viruses  <cit> . despite this, the reason why these two tlrs have a remarkable picture of adaptive evolution is not yet clearly understood. some recent studies showed that in different species, the same tlr molecule recognizes specific ligands or that the same ligand triggers responses with different intensities . for example, in rodent species, tlr <dig> does not respond to synthetic ligands such as imiquimod , resiquimod , and some guanine nucleotide analogs, as non-rodent species do  <cit> . this is probably caused by the variation in the surface charge and the existence of different secondary structures in different species. in addition, for tlr <dig>  differences in ligand recognition between humans, bovines, equines and murines have also been described . although more studies are required to fully assess the specificity of ligand recognition and the responses that are triggered in each species, this might explain the similar patterns of evolution observed for these tlrs. the reason for the difference observed between the number of psc in tlr <dig>  and tlr <dig>  is also unclear since both recognize ssrna. a similar degree of positive selection acting in both receptors would be expected. functional or structural differences in ligand recognition or in ligand specificity should be at the basis of the observed differences. structural differences do exist in ligand recognition, but more studies are required. indeed, tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> exist as preformed dimers while tlr <dig>  along with the others tlrs, exists as monomer and just form the dimer after ligand binding  <cit> . differences in tissue expression have also been observed which might account for the different pattern. although both tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> are expressed in the lung, tlr <dig> is also expressed in the placenta and spleen while tlr <dig> is expressed also in peripheral blood leukocytes  <cit> .

tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> were the receptors with the lower percentage of codons under positive selection . tlr <dig> has been shown to be mostly under purifying selection, but it has previously been shown to have also been subject to positive selection in chicken, contrary to the remaining avian tlrs  <cit> , and more recently four psc were found in the vertebrates  <cit> . the study of huang and co-workers also showed evidence of one psc in vertebrate tlr <dig> which was the first report of adaptive selection acting on this receptor now further supported by the present study. tlr <dig> has also low proportion of psc , but positive selection has been previously found in primates  <cit>  and teleosts  <cit> .

seven codons were found to be under positive selection in tlr <dig>  the study of huang and co-workers revealed no positive selection on tlr <dig>  <cit> . their analyses of tlr <dig> encompassed sixteen species, including a marsupial, a monotreme and an amphibian, which were not included in our study. in addition, their analyses only focused on paml  results whether ours also included the different models implemented in the data monkey web server which might explain the difference observed.

the tlr <dig> interacts with tlr <dig> to recognize triacyl lipoproteins  <cit> . in turn, tlr <dig> also form heterodimers with tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> to recognize the largest variety of ligands of all the tlrs   <cit> . in tlr <dig>  six codons were found under positive selection in mammals, in line with the observation of huang and co-workers . signatures of positive selection in this gene were also found in bovines  <cit> , primates  <cit> , rodents  <cit>  and in birds  <cit> . the wide range of ligands as well as the need for heterodimerization  make the tlr <dig> prone to contrasting evolutionary patterns: conservation of its function, including the capacity of heterodimerization, and adaptive evolution to the environment and the pathogens specific from each species  <cit> .

location and characterization of the psc in the tlr domains
the lrrfinder software  <cit>  was used to delimitate the functional domains of each tlr gene in order to assess the functional significance of the putatively selected sites. human tlr sequences were used as a reference . the characterization of the charge and polarity of each amino acid possibility in sites under selection is also available in additional file  <dig>  table s31; additional file  <dig>  table s32; additional file  <dig>  table s33; additional file  <dig>  table s34; additional file  <dig>  table s35; additional file  <dig>  table s36; additional file  <dig>  table s37; additional file  <dig>  table s38; additional file  <dig>  table s39; additional file  <dig>  table s <dig> 

a total number of sites under selection.

b in comparison with the delimitation of human domains of each tlr gene.

the tlrs are composed of an extracellular domain that binds the pamps, a signal transmembrane domain and an intracellular domain, designated the tir domain that binds adapter molecules and that triggers the intracellular cascades leading to the innate immune response. the convex surface of the extracellular lrr domains, by being involved in the recognition of the pamps, is highly variable. at variance, the tir domain is highly conserved as it is involved in the signaling cascades  <cit> . this suggests that the different domains of the tlr molecules are under different evolutionary pressures.

most positively selected sites were located in the extracellular lrrs. a few instances of positive selection were detected in the remaining domains. all tlrs, with the exception of tlr <dig>  have at least one codon under positive selection located in the lrr ectodomain and most of the psc found within each tlr are mostly located in this domain . the lrr ectodomain is the main point of interaction with pamps  <cit> , which are conserved motifs  <cit> . therefore, some functional constrain is expected in order to preserve the tlr ability in identifying pathogens. however, as pathogens are evolving constantly to evade host recognition, it is likely that tlrs should co-evolve with them. our results suggest that this constant evolving nature of pathogens is accompanied by tlrs. some species-specific substitutions may be reflected on the high number of psc found in this domain. this could be related to the pamps they recognize.

in general, the lrrs are composed by a concave surface, more conservative, composed by a leucine-rich sequence, xlxxlxlxx, and by a convex surface, more exposed and more variable, xΦxxΦx4fxxlx, where x represents any amino acid and Φ a hydrophobic amino acid. of the seventy one codons identified under positive selection in the lrrs of all tlrs, forty eight were localized in the variable segment which supports our hypothesis of co-evolution between host and pathogen . interestingly, the three tlrs with more psc in variable segment of lrrs are the viral tlr <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  with  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. this high proportion of psc in the variable segment of lrrs found in three viral tlrs may be indicative of the receptors' evolution shaped by viral nucleic acids  characteristic from each species. as nucleic acids are supposed to directly interact with this convex surface, variation or evidence of positive selection in it may be the result of host adaptation to viral evolution.

the two receptors with more signatures of natural selection, tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  showed a large number of psc in the lrr domain, even though ligand recognition is made differently  <cit> . along with tlr <dig> and  <dig>  tlr <dig> has a longer amino acid sequence in its ectodomain domain than other tlrs and contains an irregular segment of  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids between lrr <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . the ectodomain is cleaved in the endolysosome to enable ligand recognition  <cit> . thus, the functional ectodomain of human tlr <dig> comprises lrr15- <dig> and c-terminal lrr. following ligand binding, tlr <dig> recruits the tir adaptor proteins and initiates signaling  <cit> . our results show that fifteen of the psc are located in the region comprising lrr-nt-lrr <dig> that is cleaved. four amino acids are located to the irregular lrr insertion before lrr <dig> ; however the functional importance of this region has not yet been clarified and is regarded as a new n-terminal lrr of the truncated structure  <cit> . recently, it has also been described for its crucial importance in tlr <dig> activation, especially the alanine substitutions in this region that can affect the activation of this receptor  <cit> . alanine at the amino acid position  <dig> that was found to be under selective pressure may be interesting to study in greater detail. furthermore, govindaraj et al.  proposed that this undefined region is responsible for the species-specificity in ligand recognition that is found at least between non-rodents and rodents   <cit> . the surface charge variation among species is crucial for the species specific pathogen recognition even though this region is not directly involved in ligand interaction  <cit> . in all four positions identified under selection in this irregular insertion, the amino acid possibilities may result in charge variation which might suggest a role for the specificity in ligand recognition . of the other eight residues identified in this molecule, only one is in lrr <dig>  lrr <dig> has been described for its importance in ligand recognition together with lrr <dig> and  <dig>   <cit> .

the tlr <dig> forms a dimer with md- <dig>  the lps interacts with a large hydrophobic pocket in md- <dig> and directly bridges m-shaped receptor dimer composed of two copies arranged symmetrically  <cit> . nineteen of the twenty two psc in the tlr <dig> are located in the lrr domain. at least six of these codons have been previously identified as sites under positive selection in primates  <cit>  and some have functional importance in pamp recognition   <cit> . from the three-dimensional structure of the tlr <dig> heterodimer , it is possible to observe that some of the positively selected residues identified in this molecule are in the region that participates in the interaction between tlr <dig>  md- <dig> and lps . in all those positions, with the exception of position  <dig> where the three amino acid possibilities  are all conservative, amino acid substitutions might result in changes in polarity and charge . nevertheless, the result of these variations in the function and structure of the molecule remains to be assessed. in addition, some of the identified psc are located in close contact in the tlr <dig> homodimers  and might have implications for dimerization.

in tlr <dig>  three psc lay in lrr <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the lrr <dig> psc is in the variable segment and this lrr has been previously described as under positive selection in bovines  <cit> . despite that, these lrrs have not been recognized as sites of direct interaction with pamps neither involved in heterodimerization, so this result may not necessarily reflect any present functional importance but the result of ancient selective events  <cit> . in the heterodimers tlr1-tlr <dig>  and tlr2-tlr <dig>  only one of the identified amino acids  are located in significant regions for ligand binding  and one  in close proximity with sites involved in heterodimerization    <cit> . it is interesting to note that in tlr <dig>  the regions identified as important for dimerization  have not been subject to positive selection, which is a trace of functional conservation, particularly important as tlr <dig> dimerizes with three other tlrs to recognize different pamps  <cit> .

in the viral tlr <dig>  nine psc were identified,  <dig> of which are located in the lrr domain . the residue  <dig> belongs to a dsrna-tlr <dig> interaction site in the lrr-nt to lrr <dig> region   <cit> . in this site, five amino acid possibilities were detected along the species studied which could be a species adaptation to the recognition of specific dsrna viruses and reflect co-evolution.

for the tlr <dig>  three psc were detected in the lrr domain. the residues  <dig> and  <dig> are located within the  <dig> amino acid region identified by andersen-nissen et al  as important for flagellin recognition  <cit>  and were previously reported as being under positive selection in primates  <cit> .

the tir domain of the tlrs is highly conserved across multiple species of animals, plants  <cit>  and microbes  <cit>  due to its significance as signaling domain  <cit> . three box regions of the tir domain, which are important in signal transduction, are highly conserved in the tlrs genes  and should be rather under a strong purifying selection  <cit> . as expected, due to their functional constraints, we verified that none of the nine sites identified as under positive selection in the tir domain were located in these boxes. this observation is expected as these boxes, due to their functional constraints, should be rather under a strong purifying selection  <cit> .

the tlr with more psc in the tir domain was tlr <dig> where three codons under selection were located within the highly conserved tir domain and although amino acid alterations at codon  <dig> are conservative, alterations at codons  <dig> and  <dig> might induce differences in charge and polarity of the protein, respectively . despite the expected functional constraints specific of this domain, it seems that the tlr <dig> protein may present some flexibility with regards to amino acid composition in this domain. in human, tlr <dig> has been suggested to be functionally redundant. indeed, tlr5392stop is a non-functional allele that may reach considerable frequencies in some human populations  despite increasing the susceptibility to the legionnaires' disease. positive selection has been proposed as a mechanism for favoring gene loss in human evolution  <cit> . this suggests that other proteins exist, yet to be determined, that might be able to compensate for a loss of function of this tlr.

in the remaining domains a few pscs were identified although they can have functional or evolutionary importance. indeed, in the signal domain, we identified five pscs. this domain mostly mediates or regulates the transport of the secretory proteins to their destination compartment in the cell  <cit> . given the role of this domain, it is likely that these five amino acids might interfere with the correct location of the secretory proteins in the different cell compartments. in the lrr- nt domain we identified one psc in tlr <dig>  this domain is known for its importance in stabilizing the lrr structure by protecting the hydrophobic core  <cit> . however, in the tlr <dig> molecule this domain is cleaved along with lrr1- <dig> to enable ligand recognition  <cit> , thus no particular importance can be attributed. in the 3' end of the lrr structure we find the lrr-ct where two psc were found. the role of this domain is similar to lrr-nt so these residues might be important for the stabilization of the molecule in particular for the formation of the dimers tlr4-md <dig> and tlr10-tlr <dig>  <cit> . in the psc identified in the lrr-ct, amino acid variation between species does not alter the charge . this also happens in all five positions under positive selection in the transmembrane domain of tlr  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . the transmembrane segment is responsible for the junction between the tlr and the plasmatic membrane. in some cases, it is also associated with the localization of the tlr in intracellular compartments and its interaction with accessory molecules  <cit> . this domain is expected to be highly conserved and only few mutations have been described  <cit> . nevertheless, we found five codons under positive selection in this domain.

in summary, pathogens usually develop strategies to evade recognition by the host immune system. therefore, motifs in the pathogen that are involved in the recognition tend to evolve faster to avoid this recognition. if the pathogen is evolving, the receptor that recognizes the pathogen should also evolve to keep pace with the changes that occur in the pathogen. this arms-race is responsible for this continuum of alterations in both the pathogen and the receptor which can be detected as signatures of positive selection. for example, positive selection in rna viruses has been shown to occur as the result of this arms-race  <cit> . thus, changes in the sequence of rna or dna of the pathogen will cause the receptor not to recognize them. this will force alterations in the receptor which might change the geometry of the interaction. for this reason, if different ligands  are recognized by one receptor, it is likely that more changes are observed than for receptors that recognize only one ligand. in line with this, our results may reflect the co-evolution between each host and its pathogens and commensals, especially in viral tlrs  and in the non-viral tlr <dig>  in addition, the fact that the mutation rates for rna and dna viruses tend to be generally higher than for bacteria and yeast  <cit>  also correlates with our results. viral tlrs will thus encounter ligands that evolve faster than non-viral tlr. tlr <dig> might appear as an exception due to the wide variety of ligands that it recognizes, which include viruses.

CONCLUSIONS
evidence of positive selection was found for all the mammalian tlrs studied. adaptive selection has clearly played a role in shaping the diversity of both viral and non-viral tlrs. location of some of the positively selected codons indicate that pathogens exert most of the selective pressures that lead to the changes observed mostly in the lrr ectodomain, especially in its variable segment responsible for direct interaction with pamps. this suggests that they are the result of co-evolution. further studies are important to clarify the ligand for each tlr in each species as it could give new clues for the interpretation of these results. also, crystallographic studies would be helpful for assessing the functional relevance of the pscs detected.
