BACKGROUND
rye  is a temperate cereal belonging to the tribe triticeae, which is grown mainly in europe and northern america. its uses include grain, hay, pasture, cover crop, green fodder, and green manure. more than 50% of the annual rye harvest is used for bread making, resulting in rich, dark bread that holds its freshness for about a week. despite its relatively low acreage compared to other cereals, rye is of great importance due to its broad tolerance to biotic and abiotic stress, a feature generally lacking in other temperate cereals. thus, rye remains an important grain crop species for cool temperate zones.

besides its importance as a crop, rye is one of the parents of a man-made species triticale and the short arm of rye chromosome  <dig>  has been introgressed into several hundreds of wheat cultivars  <cit> . in fact, some of the most successful wheat varieties carry the 1bl.1rs translocation as the presence of 1rs in the wheat genome increases both yield and protein content in grains  <cit> . moreover, 1rs carries a cluster of genes encoding resistance to stem, leaf and yellow rust – sr <dig>  lr <dig> and yr <dig>  respectively  <cit>  and a self-incompatibility locus  <cit> . on the down side, 1rs carries the sec- <dig> locus coding for ε-secalin, which negatively affects bread making quality  <cit> . thus, it would be of great advantage to isolate those genes individually through map-based cloning and develop markers for marker assisted selection in rye and wheat.

despite the economic importance of rye, little is known about its genetic make up at the dna sequence level. to our knowledge, there is no ongoing sequencing project in rye, and there are no plans to target gene-rich fractions of its genome. rye is underrepresented in the sequence databases compared to wheat and barley for which  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig>  sequences respectively, are deposited in genbank. there are only  <dig>  rye sequences  available, of which about 90% are expressed sequence tags . updated list of rye genes, markers and linkage data was created by schlegel and korzun  <cit> . the lack of sequence information is a major limitation for marker development and gene cloning in this species.

the monoploid genome size of rye  is the largest among temperate cereals, almost 40% larger than that of bread wheat . this is due to the presence of a large amount of highly repetitive sequences. flavell et al.  <cit>  estimated the repetitive dna content of rye to be 92%. despite the progress in sequencing technology and bioinformatics, sequencing the whole rye genome remains a very difficult and expensive task. in particular, genome shotgun sequencing of such a large and repetitive genome seems currently impossible. on the other hand, the short arm of rye chromosome  <dig> represents only  <dig> % of the rye genome and with the molecular size of  <dig> mbp, 1rs is comparable in size to the whole rice genome, which was recently sequenced  <cit> . recently, a method has been developed to dissect large plant genomes into individual chromosomes using flow cytometric sorting . a protocol for sorting individual rye chromosomes has been set up by kubaláková et al.  <cit> , and Šimková et al.  <cit>  created two bac libraries from flow sorted 1rs arms. the library represents a valuable tool for map-based cloning, targeted sequencing and marker development.

*monoploid genome size 

end sequencing of bac clones enables generating random sequence information distributed across the whole genome. kelley et al.  <cit>  developed a protocol for high throughput bac end sequence  generation using automated sequencers. this protocol is now a routine in large sequencing centers, reducing cost and enabling the creation of large data sets. nevertheless, the number of bess from the triticeae tribe is currently limited with only  <dig>  hexaploid wheat bess and  <dig> triticum monococcum bess in genbank, representing the whole tribe. beyond the sequence information itself, bess are a valuable source of molecular markers. shultz et al.  <cit>  used bess derived from bacs, representing minimum tiling path of soybean, to develop new microsatellite markers. among the first  <dig> primer pairs tested, more than 60% were polymorphic. paux et al.  <cit>  took advantage of a bac library specific for wheat chromosome 3b  <cit> , and sequenced bac ends to isolate chromosome-specific molecular markers based on inserted transposable elements . paux et al.  <cit>  succeeded in developing thirty-nine 3b-specific markers to anchor bac contigs to the genetic/deletion map and have since then developed several hundreds of isbp markers from 3b . according to the authors' estimate, about 5% of bess are suitable for isbp development.

here, we report on dna sequence composition of the short arm of rye chromosome  <dig>  and on the development of new molecular markers for this chromosome arm using  <dig> mb of bac end sequences. we demonstrate that the combination of chromosome arm-specific bac library with bac end sequencing technology offers a cost efficient strategy to survey the composition of the rye genome and saturate chromosome 1rs with molecular markers.

methods
plant material
seeds of rye  cv. imperial and wheat  cv. chinese spring were kindly provided by prof. a. j. lukaszewski . seeds of barley  cv. akcent were obtained from dr. p. martínek . a ditelocentric 1rs wheat-rye  addition line  was obtained from dr. b. friebe .

1rs-specific bac libraries
two bac libraries specific for the short arm of rye chromosome  <dig> were constructed from dna of 1rs arms, which were flow-sorted from the above mentioned wheat-rye ditelocentric 1rs addition line  <cit> . the sccimp1rsha library  consists of  <dig>  clones with an average insert size of  <dig> kb ordered in  <dig> × 384-well plates. the sccimp1rsba library  consists of  <dig>  clones with an average insert size of  <dig> kb ordered in  <dig> × 384-well plates. collectively both libraries cover the chromosome arm 14-fold. as the 1rs arms were sorted from wheat alien chromosome addition line, the libraries contain about 14% of clones from various wheat chromosomes  <cit> .

bac end sequencing
two plates from each bac library  were chosen randomly for bac end sequencing. dna templates were prepared in 384-well format by a standard alkaline lysis method. the end sequencing was performed using applied biosystems  big dye terminator chemistry and analyzed on abi 3730xl sequencer. base calling was performed using tracetuner and sequences were trimmed for vector and low quality sequences using lucy  <cit> .

annotation of sequences
three repeat databases were used to analyze the repetitive fraction of the bac-end sequences: treptotal  <cit> , repbase  <cit>  and tigr plant repeat databases  <cit> . for identification of genes in bess,  <dig>  puts  from various plant species were used. puts of arabidopsis thaliana , avena sativa , brachypodium distachyon , glycine max , hordeum vulgare , oryza sativa , secale cereale , sorghum bicolor , triticum aestivum , triticum monococcum  and zea mays  were downloaded from plantgdb  <cit> .

identification of repetitive dna elements
a semi-automated pipeline  <cit>  was used to search for repetitive dna elements in bac-end sequences. the procedure involved two steps to find known repeats in a sequence and an additional step identifying potential repeats. in the first step, repeatmasker  <cit>  with the crossmatch algorithm and default settings was used to search repeats without specifying a custom library. thereafter, sequences were searched against treptotal, repbase and tigr plant repeat databases. in the second step sequences were searched using tblastx   <cit>  against the same databases. sequences matching known repeats were masked with an "x". putative unknown repeats were identified by searching masked bess with blastn  <cit>  against themselves and  <dig>  genome survey sequences  of triticum and aegilops spp. downloaded from genbank  <cit> . sequences displaying 80% identity over at least  <dig> bp and five matches were assumed as unknown repeats and masked with an "x". the fraction of genome, represented by each repetitive dna element, was calculated as ratio of cumulative length of sequences with homology to the element and the total length of bes data set.

gene content analysis
the repeat masked sequences were subjected to a homology search using blastn  against the put collections mentioned above. cumulative match length was used to calculate the fraction of coding sequences in the rye genome as described for repetitive elements. sequences matching puts coding for te-related proteins were omitted. sequences with alignment longer than  <dig> bp were searched using blastx against non-redundant protein sequences .

development of molecular markers
we used sciroko  <dig>  computer program  <cit>  with default settings  for the identification of microsatellites in the bac end sequences. bess containing junction between two different sequences  were identified from repeat-masking analysis for development of isbp markers. primer pairs were designed using primer <dig> software  <cit>  with default settings to border corresponding junction.

chromosome sorting and dna amplification
ten thousand 1r chromosomes were sorted from rye cv. imperial according to kubaláková et al.  <cit>  into  <dig> μl ddh2o using a facsvantage se cell sorter . twenty thousand all rye chromosomes except 1r  were sorted in the same way . chromosomal dna obtained after proteinase treatment was amplified using genomiphi dna amplification kit  according to the manufacturer's instruction to obtain  <dig> μg chromosome-specific dna.

physical mapping of molecular markers
sixty four isbp primer sets were tested for 1rs specificity. for this purpose pcr was carried out on several dna templates: a – rye ; b – wheat ; c -wheat-rye  telocentric 1rs addition; d – flow-sorted chromosome 1r; e – flow-sorted chromosomes 2r – 7r. genomic dna was isolated using invisorb spin plant mini kit  according to the manufacturer's instruction. the  <dig> μl standard pcr reaction contained  <dig> ng dna, 1× pcr buffer,  <dig> % cresol red,  <dig> % sucrose,  <dig>  mm each of dntps,  <dig> μm primers,  <dig>  u taq dna polymerase. pcr was performed in a ptc- <dig> thermal cycler  as follows: initial denaturation at 95°c for  <dig> min;  <dig> cycles of 95°c for  <dig> sec, 62°c for  <dig> sec, 72°c for  <dig> sec; final extension for  <dig> minutes at 72°c. pcr products were separated on 2% agarose gel.

localization of a new repeat by fluorescence in situ hybridization 
to localize a newly identified repeat on mitotic metaphase chromosomes of rye, wheat and barley, root tips were collected to ice water for 26– <dig> h, fixed in a mixture of absolute alcohol: glacial acetic acid  at 37°c for seven days and stored at -18°c. cytological preparations and in situ hybridization with labeled dna were made according to massoudi-nejad et al.  <cit> . digoxigenin-labeled probe was prepared from the newly identified cop <dig> repeat by pcr with specific primers . for identification of wheat homoeologous groups, reprobing with two additional probes was done. biotin-labeled probe for gaa microsatellites was prepared using pcr with  <dig> and  <dig> primers and wheat genomic dna as a template. a probe for 260-bp fragment of the afa family repeat was prepared and labeled by digoxigenin using pcr with primers as-a and as-b on wheat genomic dna according to kubaláková et al.  <cit> . chromosomes were counterstained with  <dig>  μg/ml 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole . hybridization signal was visualized with anti-digoxigenin-fluorescein and cy3-labeled streptavidin and observed under a fluorescence microscope .

RESULTS
bac end sequencing and sequence trimming
four 384-well plates originating from two bac libraries specific for rye chromosome arm 1rs were chosen to provide a uniform and random sample of 1rs. bac clones were sequenced from both ends and after trimming,  <dig>   useful sequences  were obtained. in total,  <dig> , <dig> bp of 1rs specific sequences were generated with average read length of  <dig> bp. these sequences represent  <dig> % dna of the short arm of rye chromosome  <dig>  analysis of the gc content of the sequenced fraction of 1rs is showed a  <dig> % composition. all sequences were deposited in genbank .

identification and characterization of repetitive dna elements
the cumulative length of the sequences with homology to a certain repetitive element was used to estimate its representation in the rye genome. for example, sequences with homology to copia retroelements had a cumulative length of  <dig>  bp representing  <dig> % of the bess . should bess composition be representative for rye, copia elements account for  <dig> % of the whole rye genome .

in total,  <dig> % of the data set showed homology to repeats deposited in the databases listed above. retrotransposons  were the dominant repeat group in the analyzed sequences, comprising  <dig> % of sequencing data. in contrast, class ii elements  constituted only a minor part of 1rs . almost the same fraction of the sequences analyzed  showed high similarity to ribosomal rna genes. this is consistent with the presence of the nucleolar organizing region  on 1rs.

searching bes with masked repeats against themselves and genome survey sequences  from triticum and aegilops spp., identified  <dig>  bp  as unknown repetitive elements. however, the bess were generally not long enough  to cover complete units of the newly identified repeats and allow the identification of new elements. thus, most of the sequences could not be further characterized. only one repeat, cop <dig> with a unit length of about  <dig> bp could be further characterized. two bess, sccimp1rsha_0079_a17f  and sccimp1rsha_0079_j11f , contained each one complete and one partial unit of this repeat with identity ranging from  <dig> to 95%. these sequences were used for multiple alignment  and consensus sequence calculation . finally, a blast search  against the complete bes data set revealed eight complete or partial units. assuming that our data set represents  <dig> % of 1rs, one can estimate that there is more than  <dig>  cop <dig> units in chromosome 1rs. blast search against ncbi nr database  revealed additional units in bac clones from t. turgidum subsp.durum , t. turgidum subsp. dicoccoides  and h. vulgare  with similarities ranging from  <dig> to 90%. in each sequence,  <dig> –  <dig> tandemly organized units were identified.

repeat composition of rye bess was compared to  <dig>  mbp sequence of random bess obtained from wheat chromosome 3b  <cit>  and  <dig>  mbp of wheat d genome sequence derived from a genomic shotgun library of the d genome progenitor aegilops tauschii  <cit> . the frequency of various types of repeats in rye, wheat b and d genomes revealed a close relationship of the rye genome and wheat b genome . to support this observation, wheat b and d genome sequences were compared to rye genome using repeatmasker with crossmatch algoritm. search of 3b bess against rye bess masked  <dig> % 3b bess with average identity  <dig> %. search of d genome sequences against rye bess masked only  <dig> % d genome sequence with average identity  <dig> %.

gene content analysis
repeat-masked sequences were subjected to a homology search using blastn  against  <dig>  plant puts downloaded from plantgdb  <cit>  to identify the transcribed part of the bac end sequences. the search retrieved  <dig> hits. sequences with homology to te-related proteins were excluded from the analysis. after that, the remaining transcribed part represented  <dig>  bp i.e.  <dig> % of the complete sequence set. assuming the average length of a gene in the family poaceae to be  <dig> kbp, one can estimate  <dig>  genes being present on chromosome arm 1rs and  <dig>  genes in the whole rye genome. forty-one sequences with alignment longer than  <dig> bp were searched against protein database using blastx. protein with significant homology  was identified for  <dig> of them. eleven of them have a putative function .

development and mapping of molecular markers
simple sequence repeats  were identified in the data set using sciroko  <dig>  software . in total,  <dig> ssrs were identified with an average length of  <dig>  bp. the most abundant motifs were trinucleotides, which were found 92-times . on average, one microsatellite was found every  <dig> bp. in addition, a total of  <dig> sites of insertion of transposable elements were identified in the data set of  <dig> , <dig> mbp. thus one may expect one transposable element insertion every  <dig> bp in the rye genome. primer pairs were designed for the  <dig> identified isbps .

sixty-four isbp primer pairs were tested for 1rs specificity. twelve of them  provided an amplification product in rye and in the wheat-rye 1rs addition line but did not show any amplification with wheat dna and thus were considered 1rs specific . an additional five markers , that amplified a product from the wheat-rye 1rs addition line, were absent from rye. all 1rs-specific primers are listed in additional file  <dig>  finally, ten isbp markers were found specific for wheat. gel electrophoresis with pcr products of the remaining  <dig> primer pairs resulted in bands occurring in both rye and wheat, in a smear, or had no product.

genomic distribution of the cop <dig> repeat
fish with a probe for the cop <dig> repeat resulted in a signal localized on proximal end of the satellite of chromosome 1r; two other clusters localized proximally on short arms of other two chromosome pairs . thus, the cop <dig> repeat seems to be clustered on three pairs of rye chromosomes. in spite of using blocking dna prepared from sheared genomic rye dna, cross-hybridization was detected on all rye chromosomes. fish in hexaploid wheat revealed dispersed signals over  <dig> chromosomes , indicating that cop <dig> is dispersed in one of the three wheat homoeologous genomes. reprobing with probes for gaa microsatellites and afa repeat proved that the repeat is localized on the d genome chromosomes. no signal was detected after fish with the cop <dig> repeat on barley metaphase chromosomes .

discussion
we generated and analyzed  <dig> mbp of bac end sequences from the short arm of rye chromosome  <dig>  accounting for  <dig> % dna of the arm. this study provides the largest amount of genomic sequence data for rye and allows the first systematic analysis of the dna sequence composition of the rye genome. because the bac clones selected for end sequencing were chosen randomly and originated from bac libraries constructed with two different restriction enzymes, the bess produced here are expected to be randomly distributed along the whole chromosome arm. assuming that there is no or little difference in sequence composition among different rye chromosomes, one can consider this sequence as representative of the whole rye genome. the gc content of 1rs  is comparable to  <dig> % and 44% gc content in wheat  and rice genomes  <cit> , respectively.

the observed content of repetitive sequences  is lower than expected and is similar to that found in the wheat b genome  by paux et al.  <cit> . as indicated above, rye has a significantly higher 1cx value than bread wheat. thus, assuming an equal number of genes, the rye genome should contain more repeats than the wheat genome. in fact, using cot analysis, flavell et al.  <cit>  estimated the content of repetitive elements in rye genome to be of about 92%. our low estimate could be due to insufficient representation of rye repeats in databases that were used in our analyses. for example, the treptotal database, which showed most of the significant matches, comprises only  <dig> entries of rye repeats. this limited information, compared to wheat and barley with  <dig> and  <dig> elements, respectively , could result is short sequence alignments and hence underestimation of the amount of repeated dna in rye bes. as expected, class i elements  were the most abundant repetitive fraction in the rye genome similar to what was found for the wheat and maize genomes  <cit> .

a comparison of the frequency of various types of repeats in genomes of rye and wheat b and d genomes suggested a greater similarity between the rye and wheat b genome than between the rye and wheat d genome. this close relationship of rye and wheat b genome was also supported at the sequence level. it is interesting to note that rye and the putative b genome progenitor aegilops speltoides have the same mating system, both being outcrossers. moreover, the b genome is largest of the three homeoelogous wheat genomes and similar in size to the rye genome. on the other hand, the similarity in repeat composition between both genomes may simply reflect similar trends in the mode of their expansion via the ltr-retrotransposon activation.

until now, the lack of sequence data did not permit estimation of the number of genes in rye. by analyzing  <dig> mbp sequence from chromosome arm 1rs, we estimate  <dig>  genes being present on 1rs and thus  <dig>  genes in the rye genome. this first estimate for rye is consistent with the predicted gene numbers in other plants. most recent estimate for gene number in a. thaliana genome is  <dig>    <cit> , the current tigr rice genome annotation   <cit>  estimates  <dig>  genes in rice genome. both numbers are close to our prediction for rye.

in addition to the analysis of the rye genome composition, we used bac end sequences for marker development. there is still a low density of markers available for rye genome and additional markers are urgently needed. development of a genetic linkage map of rye with  <dig> markers was reported by korzun et al.  <cit> . bednarek et al.  <cit>  presented a genetic map of rye containing  <dig> markers including  <dig> rflps,  <dig> aflps,  <dig> rapds and  <dig> proteins. khlestkina et al.  <cit>  mapped  <dig> ssrs derived from est sequences , nine of which mapped to chromosome 1r. several attempts were made to transfer ssr and/or est-ssr markers from wheat and barley into rye  <cit> . recently varshney et al.  <cit>  succeeded in transferring and mapping  <dig> barley snp markers in rye. thus, to date the density of markers is quite low and does not allow efficient map based cloning or mas in rye.

this work presents a method for targeted development of molecular markers from specific parts of the rye genome using the 1rs chromosome arm as a case study. until now, there are only a few markers available for this critical part of the rye genome. this hampers marker assisted breeding not only in rye, but also in wheat where the markers from 1rs would permit selection of lines with introgressions of desired parts of 1rs without the harmful genes. we have developed twelve new isbps markers for 1rs and designed almost  <dig> additional primer pairs for potential isbp markers that remain to be tested. if needed, generation of additional bac end sequences from 1rs is possible. in addition to the development of new isbp markers, bes containing microsatellites were used to develop new 1rs-specific ssr markers. out of the  <dig> tested microsatellites that were tested,  <dig> were specific for 1rs  <cit> . thus, in total  <dig> 1rs-specific markers were obtained using our strategy. on the other hand, badnarek et al.  <cit>  isolated  <dig> aflp and rapd markers from genomic dna and only  <dig> markers were specific for 1rs. this clearly demonstrates the efficiency of the targeted approach.

one of the potential problems in targeted marker development from the 1rs-specific bac library is the contamination with clones from wheat dna. this could explain the specificity of amplification for several isbp markers with wheat dna. as the 1rs arm was flow-sorted from a wheat-rye ditelosomic addition line, contamination by fragments of wheat chromosomes cannot be avoided. however, the contamination of the 1rs bac library was estimated to be only 14%  <cit>  and thus should not seriously compromise the efficiency of marker development. further improvement could be achieved by selecting bac clones from contigs after fingerprinting the library, as the contigs originate from the chromosome of interest while the infrequent contaminating bacs remain as singletons.

the discovery of five isbp markers, which were specific only for 1rs maintained in the wheat-rye ditelosomic addition line and were not found in diploid rye, was unexpected. although the same cultivars  were used for the development of the 1rs wheat-rye addition line as well as for marker testing, these insertion sites were absent from rye and wheat. this suggests that some mobile elements were activated only after the addition of 1rs telocentric to wheat, most probably as a consequence of interspecific hybridization. among the five activated elements three are retrotransposons  and two are dna transposons . liu and wendel  <cit>  and shan et al.  <cit>  observed similar activation of both classes of transposable elements after a hybridization of cultivated  and wild  rice.

CONCLUSIONS
this work provides the first insights into the composition of the rye genome and its chromosome arm 1rs, in particular. we demonstrate that the use of chromosome arm-specific bac libraries facilitates the analysis of complex plant genomes by targeting particular genomic regions as well as by developing molecular markers for these regions. new molecular markers from 1rs should help in saturating the genetic map of 1rs, and aid marker assisted breeding and gene cloning.
