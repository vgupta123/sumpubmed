BACKGROUND
the proper development and viability of an organism is dependent on a group of genes called essential genes. in humans, gene essentiality has been long associated with many diseases such as miscarriages  <cit> , heritable diseases, and cancer  <cit> . recent studies have shown that over-expression of some essential genes promotes cell proliferation in cancer  <cit> . due to its importance for survival, essential genes have been targets for new therapeutics or antimicrobials  <cit> . to effectively study essential genes, generating lethal alleles in model systems is required. in the nematode caenorhabditis elegans, the essential gene set is the largest set of genes and is estimated to contain 25% of all the genes . using rnai, about  <dig> genes have been annotated as essential . inparanoid, a sequence based orthology inference tool, detects about 40% of the c. elegans genes are orthologous to the human genes. but approximately 60% of the essential genes show clear human orthologs, showing high conservation of essential genes, which makes c. elegans an excellent platform for examination of essential gene functions that are relevant to human health. many important genes, such as let-60/ras  <cit>  and let-740/dcr- <dig> <cit> , were first discovered through c. elegans genetics. however, the genetic resource for studying these genes is severely lacking. even with the concerted community effort such as the c. elegans deletion mutant consortium  <cit> , mutations in many essential genes are still lacking in the knock-out collection. the consortium have generated close to  <dig> knock-out strains since  <dig>  but only  <dig> essential genes are in the current collection  <cit> . in addition to the considerable time and effort required to generate a single knock-out allele, an outstanding disadvantage of the targeted deletion approach is that extra effort is needed to balance the lethal mutation  <cit> . recently, the consortium has adopted a procedure of random mutagenesis followed by whole genome sequencing  to generate and identify a large number of mutations  <cit> . although this project can generate more mutations in shorter time, their method does not capture mutations that exhibit lethal phenotypes, and thus, essential genes are selected against. this outcome indicates thousands of essential genes do not have knockout alleles.

to complement the effort of the c. elegans community, we took advantage of the balancer system, which was developed 30 years ago for capturing and maintaining lethal mutations, with the next-generation dna sequencing technologies. almost 70% of the c. elegans genome have been successfully balanced by large genomic rearrangements  <cit> . by mutagenizing a pre-balanced strain removes the need to perform additional genetic crosses to balance a lethal mutation. the balancer system, designed specifically to capture and maintain lethal mutations, is the system of choice for generating mutations in essential genes. such screens have been carried out for regions in chromosome i  <cit> , ii  <cit> , iii  <cit> , iv , v  <cit> , and x  <cit> . in our laboratories, we have generated over  <dig> lethal mutations that fall into  <dig> complementation groups.

the next hurdle in the analysis of essential genes is the molecular identification of the genomic lesion, which to date has involved an enormous effort. traditional methods of gene cloning that rely upon candidate identification of mapped mutations can take months or years. this gene-by-gene approach was only able to characterize  <dig> essential genes from our library to date. this problem has been difficult to solve until the recent advances in sequencing technology. to address the problem of coding region identification, we have recently developed a fast and scalable pipeline that takes advantage of whole genome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis to identify the causal mutation responsible for the lethal phenotype  <cit> . recent studies, including our initial analysis of let- <dig> <cit> , have shown that whole genome sequencing is an efficient and cost-effective approach to identifying the encoded gene product especially when there are additional alleles that can be sequenced to provide confirmation . in this paper, we describe our approach of combining an established mutagenesis technique with the latest sequencing technology in order to close the gap in the essential gene knock-out collection.

RESULTS
chromosome i left has a high percentage of essential genes
the leftmost  <dig>  mbp of chromosome i has the highest percentage of mapped essential genes and closest to saturation with  <dig> essential genes isolated and mapped  <cit> . the mutant strains were derived by mutagenizing kr <dig>  with a low dose of ems and isolating let-x dpy- <dig> unc- <dig> homozygotes rescued with a third wild-type allele of dpy- <dig> and let-x balanced by free duplication sdp <dig> <cit>  . in order to position the genes, mutations were mapped into  <dig> zones using a combination of three-factor mapping and complementation to a series of duplications and deficiencies  <cit> . within zones, lethal mutants were inter-complementation tested. the earliest developmental arrest stages were determined for each complementation group  <cit> . the candidate lesions are present in two copies and rescued by a third wild-type allele on sdp <dig>  thus, our high throughput identification method focused on finding heterozygous mutations that exhibit an allelic ratio between the range of 40% to 90%  <cit> . in order to assess the accuracy of our recently developed high throughput method  <cit> , we selected  <dig> genes from this set with the criteria that they formed a complementation group having more than one allele . the extra alleles provide an added resource for validation. we sequenced  <dig> indexed genomic dna samples per illumina hiseq lane and obtained a total of  <dig> gbp of sequence. the sequencing reads were aligned using bwa  <cit>  to the ws <dig> c. elegans reference sequence. we achieved 30x coverage on average across the whole genome and an average of 35x coverage in coding elements. in the case of two strains, only 6x coverage was obtained: let- <dig> and let- <dig>  genomes from these two strains were removed from subsequent analysis.

the mutational landscape provided a quality check
our first analytical step, as a quality check, was to confirm the presence of the dpy- <dig>  and unc- <dig>  mutations in each genome. for unc- <dig>  the expected variant ratio should be 100% because the duplication does not extend far enough to provide an additional wild-type allele. for dpy- <dig> however, there is a wild-type allele on sdp <dig>  and thus we would expect to see a 66% variant ratio. we found the expected ratios in  <dig> of the  <dig> genomes. three genomes deviated from the norm: let- <dig> is missing both e <dig> and e <dig> ; let- <dig> is missing e61; let- <dig> has e <dig>  but with a 33% ratio rather than the expected 66%. we examined these strains for the presence of the duplication sdp <dig>  when the duplication is present, the read depth is 33% greater in the first 7mbp of chromosome i than for rest of the chromosome. our analysis showed that none of these three genomes showed any depth difference . it is likely these strains do not carry sdp <dig>  although sdp <dig> does not crossover with the normal homologs at a readily detectable frequency, rare exchange events can occur resulting in subsequent loss of the duplicated fragment  <cit> . these three strains were not analyzed further.

coding sequence correlated with high confidence
we analyzed the parental strain kr <dig> and identified  <dig> snvs and  <dig> small indels that show >40% read support on chromosome i when compared to the c. elegans ws <dig> reference using varscan . these mutations represent the background mutations in which the lethal mutations were maintained. for the remaining  <dig> genomes, we filtered out the background mutations and found on average  <dig> snvs that show >40% allelic ratio in the sdp <dig> region. most of the snvs are g > a or c > t changes as expected and previously observed after ems treatment  <cit> . we also found an average of  <dig> small indels of 1–2 bps. we categorized each mutation as either nonsense, missense, synonymous, splice signal disruption, frame shifting indel, frame preserving indel, or noncoding mutation. noncoding mutations were defined as any mutation located outside of coding regions. a full list of snvs and indels, for each strain, is available on our server at http://lethal.mbb.sfu.ca/jschu/essential_genes.

we identified candidate mutations for the  <dig> genomes using our bioinformatics pipeline that we developed previously  <cit>   and validated a subset of our candidates by sequencing a second allele or by complementation testing . nine of our candidate lesions were in genes that had been previously identified and published. in a few cases, candidates expected to be in separate genes were located in the same coding region. these observations were confirmed by further genetic complementation tests . previously identified let- <dig> and let- <dig> were found to be allelic to let- <dig>  as a result, let- <dig> gains three new sdp2-balanced alleles  in addition to the nine existing ones. let- <dig> and let- <dig> are allelic to let- <dig> and thus let- <dig> gains four new alleles: h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig> and h <dig>  let- <dig> fails to complement let- <dig> and now has five alleles: h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig>  and h <dig>  thirty-five candidates were tested by sequencing a second allele using previously published complementation data  <cit> . of these, we confirmed  <dig> identities. all in all, we tested  <dig> candidates and confirmed  <dig> . for the remaining  <dig> genomes, we have high confidence in the identity of  <dig> genes based on their map position. thus, including previously described let- <dig>  we now have coding region assignments for  <dig> let- genes in the sdp <dig> region. because the genes in this study all have multiple alleles, thus by inference, we have confidently identified the coding regions affected in a total of  <dig> mutant strains .table  <dig>

seven of these genes have been molecularly identified and phenotypically described. let- <dig>  an aurora kinase  <cit> , and let- <dig>  the cyclin e, had severe gonadal defects  <cit> . let- <dig>  a dead box helicase, and let- <dig>  an integrator subunit, failed to develop gametes  <cit> . let- <dig>  let- <dig>  and let- <dig> produced malformed embryos that were not laid or hatched  <cit> . let- <dig> encodes a hexaprenyl pyrophosphate synthetase that is associated with parkinson’s disease  <cit> . let- <dig> encodes the n-acetyl transferase nath- <dig>  let- <dig> encodes mdt- <dig>  a mediator subunit. a comprehensive summary of the let- encoded products is given in table  <dig> 

novel knock-out alleles provide new genetic resources
we have generated new alleles for  <dig> genes that currently have no knock-out alleles available: let- <dig> , let- <dig> , rnp- <dig> , aars- <dig> , let- <dig> , let- <dig> , let- <dig> , fars- <dig> , let- <dig> , mdt- <dig> , acdh- <dig> , rpb- <dig> , and let- <dig> . eight of these genes are predicted to have roles in essential basic functions such as transcription or translation. this is not surprising, because we expect genes that function in basic cellular processes to be essential and are best captured using balancer systems. besides these novel alleles, we have provided additional loss of function alleles for many characterized genes . additional alleles affecting different parts of the gene may disrupt different domains providing an allelic series correlating with different phenotypes.

genetic strains carrying heritable mutational changes provide a lasting resource that can be used in a variety of experimental conditions and compared to information gained from rnai knock-down experiments. we cross-checked our high confidence list with the rnai data annotated in wormbase to see if the lethal phenotype was observed in at least two rnai experiments. although for the most part, rnai data agrees with our mutational data, not every gene was supported by rnai. we found nine genes showing no lethal phenotype with rnai and three genes showing lethal phenotype of variable penetrance . of the nine genes that show no rnai lethal phenotype, six  have additional knock-out alleles that are lethal, suggesting rnai did not reveal the null phenotype of these genes. the additional information provided by genetic mutation highlights the importance of our collection.

essential genes in sdp <dig> function in cell cycle and cytokinesis, transcriptional regulation, and rna processing
to identify the processes that are essential, we investigated the function of our high confidence gene set along with their orthologs in d. melanogaster , s. cerevisiae , and h. sapiens . essential genes are often conserved due to their important biological roles. fifty-four of our identified essential genes have readily identifiable orthologs in humans  <cit>  . we further categorized each gene into at least one of eight functional groups based on their go annotations . to have a better picture of the roles of different essential genes, multi-functional genes were categorized into more than one functional group. the cell cycle & cytokinesis, transcriptional regulation, transport, rna processing, and transcription categories contained more genes than did the groups representing translation, signal transduction, and the other groups that includes metabolic and structural processes.figure  <dig> 
functional categorization of essential genes identified in this study using go terms. the y-axis indicates the go term categories. the x-axis represents the number of genes in each category. random sampling of  <dig> iterations was done by selecting equal number of genes from either all sdp <dig> genes or the set of all essential genes identified by rnai. error bars represent standard error.



of these eight functional groups, we found three groups that were significantly enriched in the sdp <dig> region when compared to the non-essential genes in sdp2: cell cycle & cytokinesis , regulation of transcription , and rna processing . our analysis indicates that members of these processes are enriched in essential genes. we have previously shown that components of the spindle assembly checkpoint are essential for survival  <cit> . here we showed that genes in the sdp <dig> region function in various phases of the cell cycle. for instance, let- <dig>  is critical for loading hcp- <dig>  to chromatin and forming the kinetochore  <cit> . let- <dig> , let- <dig> , and let- <dig>  remove cohesions for proper resolution of centromeric connections and segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis . let- <dig>  is essential for chromatid separation and proper anaphase. in addition, let- <dig> , a member of the anaphase promoting complex , is crucial for the transition from metaphase to anaphase  <cit> . lin- <dig>  is required for dna replication and activates a checkpoint when entering into m phase  <cit> . let- <dig>  and let- <dig>  are crucial for cytokinesis during cell division  <cit> . let- <dig>  is a component of splicing complex a that functions in the meiosis entry decision  <cit> . our data indicate that disrupting any phase of the cell cycle process can lead to lethality.

are functions of the essential genes identified in this study representative of all essential genes? random sampling simulation from  <dig> essential genes indicated by rnai shows a very different go term distribution . in the larger set samples, we observed that cell cycle and cytokinesis , regulation of transcription , and rna processing  are under-represented compared to our sequenced set. although we acknowledge that comparing lethal mutants to rnai phenocopies is not fully equivalent, at the present time there is not a large enough mutant essential gene collection to do this comparison. it is intriquing nevertheless to raise the question of regional differences in essential gene functions and we look forward to having a more complete dataset that can be used to address this issue.

essential gene transcripts are supplied maternally
from the set of  <dig> essential genes,  <dig> of them arrest development as embryos or early larvae, indicating that they are important early in development. to test this hypothesis, we analyzed the temporal expression of these genes using rna-seq divided into  <dig> separate 30-minute embryonic stages,  <dig> larval stages, pre-gravid young adult stage, and the young adult stage. the normalized rna-seq data was obtained from the modencode project  <cit> .

seven distinct patterns were seen from the heatmap . five genes  express highly during mid-embryonic stage , six genes  express highly during late-embryonic stage , and seven genes  express highly in both mid-embryonic and late-embryonic stages. eighteen genes  show elevated expression very early in embryonic development . most of these genes, however, had a dramatic drop in expression level at 150 min, which is when gastrulation occurs  <cit> . observing that many of these genes also show strong expression in young adults but not in larval stages suggests that these messages are highly transcribed in the germline and are likely maternally derived in the embryo. on the other hand, nine genes  show some early embryonic expression but have their strongest expression during mid-embryonic stages. a group of four genes  show specific expression during gastrulation. lastly, eight genes  have elevated expression during specific larval stages.figure  <dig> 
this figure represents the normalized transcript level  for each gene across the developmental stages including  <dig> embryo stages separated by 30 minute interval, four larval stages , pre-gravid young adult, and gravid young adult. for comparing germline expression, we’ve included the transcript level from jk <dig> carrying a mutation in glp- <dig>  which is essential for mitotic germ cell proliferation  <cit> . the heatmap represents normalized transcript level from high  to low . seven distinct clusters that are based on their expression pattern are shown by colored branches. purple: early-embryonic; brown: early- and mid-embryonic; red: mid-embryonic; blue: late-embryonic; green: mid- and late-embryonic; orange: gastrulation; black: larval.



from the rnaseq data, we observed  <dig> genes with expression patterns that indicated maternal contribution during early embryogenesis. this ratio is not significantly different from the set of all essential genes. however, when compared with the set of non-essential genes, our essential gene list is significantly enriched for genes with strong maternal contribution . these data indicate that many essential genes important for early embryonic development have maternal contribution.

CONCLUSIONS
the function of essential genes is poorly understood. having a combination of genetic strains for which the molecular identity is known would provide a powerful resource for their study. however, even in the model system c. elegans, only about 25% of the essential genes have a knockout alleles. rnai has also been used to identify essential genes  <cit> . despite the success of these studies, only a small subset  have been profiled phenotypically  <cit> . we have a large collection of mutant strains, but only now has it been technically feasible to easily identify their corresponding coding regions. our library currently consists of  <dig> lethal mutations maintained by balancers in chromosomes i, iii, iv, and v, of which chromosome i is the closest to saturation  <cit> . recent whole genome screening experiments using the crispr/cas <dig> system have opened up the possibility of identifying essential genes using this targeted approach. however, targeted approaches directed towards identifying essential genes in an intact multicellular organism are still limited in terms of recovery and maintenance of lethal mutations and impractical for large scale screens. the relative ease of capturing and maintaining lethal mutations makes balancer systems the method of choice for essential gene studies. however, using random mutagenesis is not possible to achieve 100% saturation . small targets have a smaller chance of being mutated and are likely missed in mutagenesis experiments. also, finding new essential genes in subsequent screenings becomes more and more difficult because the screens follow  a poisson distribution giving diminishing returns. thus, a combination of targeted and forward mutational approaches is best.

we previously developed a pipeline and applied it to the identification of let- <dig> <cit> . in the analysis presented here, we applied the pipeline to further analyze  <dig> essential genes on chromosome i and produced high confidence identification for  <dig> genes. some of the confirmed candidates were found outside the mapped region suggesting that the boundaries of the genetically identified zones can be further refined. we have shown that our approach is much more efficient and cost-effective than the traditional method. assessments from this study will help us improve our identification pipeline and give us the confidence to apply this technique to the rest of our collection of essential genes.

our results here provide additional alleles to known genes as well as provide new alleles. the added alleles will be valuable for establishing allelic series that may exhibit different phenotypes. for instance let-147/rnp- <dig> has  <dig> alleles each showing a different arrest stage  <cit> , suggesting different protein domains are being disrupted. more importantly, our results provided  <dig> new alleles in essential genes where no alleles existed. the genetic resources provided with our method will be beneficial to the field of essential gene research.

we have demonstrated here that let mutants can be used, not only individually to study the gene’s function, but analyzed as a group to better understand the functions a living multi-cellular animal needs for survival. understanding the function of individual essential genes has applications for medicine. essential genes in bacteria have been exploited to develop new antimicrobials  <cit> . an understanding of essential genes can be exploited for new medical uses. for example, the human ortholog of let-400/prpf- <dig>  has been found to induce g1/s arrest and may function as a cancer suppressor  <cit> . therefore, a resource such as described here for identifying and studying essential genes in model organisms has direct benefit.

we have shown that essential genes in the left half of chromosome i in c. elegans function in cell cycle control, transcriptional regulation, and rna processing. previous reports studying other genomic regions have shown different gene classes such as those regulated by the gata transcription factor  <cit>  and the sex-regulated genes  <cit>  are non-randomly distributed in the genome. thus, we believe the organization of these genes within the genome is also non-random. with our method, it is now possible to generate genetic resources to capture the majority of the essential genes. the study of which will provide us with a global picture of the minimum set of genes and pathways that is needed for the survival of a multi-cellular organism, and their organization in the genome. an increased understanding of the nature of essential genes is relevant not only to our knowledge of the biological survival of the organism but also has the potential for better medical procedures.
