BACKGROUND
sepsis is a grave threat to human life in the modern society. it is listed as the second most common cause of death in non-coronary intensive care units and is among the top causes leading to death in the united states  <cit> . the severity of the pathogenesis of sepsis was thought to be the consequence of an uncontrolled hyperinflammatory and mostly cytokine-mediated host response. recently, a new theory was proposed, which emphasizes on the virulence of microbial pathogens and host-pathogen interactions during severe sepsis  <cit> . a number of extracellular enzymes and microbial mediators have been identified contributing to tissue damage in sepsis. these toxins compromise cellular defenses, cause damage in barriers for microbial invasion, and help the pathogens to spread within the host. in the spectrum of pathogenesis of sepsis, lipopolysaccharide  has been considered to play a crucial role in pathogen-host interaction  <cit> . lps is a major structural component of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, so as to be often referred as an endotoxin.

brain injury is observed in postmortem examination of patients dead from sepsis with lesions of multifocal necrotizing leukoencephalopathy, apoptosis, micro-abscesses, and ischemia  <cit> . systemic lps administration led to granulocyte influx into brain parenchyma in a mouse model. this influx was accompanied by disruption of the blood-brain barrier to albumin and induction of the intracellular adhesion molecule  <dig>  on affected blood vessels  <cit> . brain cell death, but no polymorphonuclear infiltration, was also observed in some autopsy materials of patients who died of septic shock  <cit> . these observations implicate multiple pathways that may underlie the brain cell death process. brain cell injury could be one of the direct causes leading to septic patient death. for instance, neuronal apoptosis in autonomic centers i.e. cardiovascular autonomic centers indicates that the septic pathogens may set off host mortality by means of damaging host brain cells  <cit> .

in the blood-brain barrier, endothelial cells are the first interface interacting with hematogenous spreading lps. lps damage to endothelial cells was shown in many studies, one of which showed that lps induced apoptosis in a bovine endothelial cell line via a soluble cd <dig> dependent pathway  <cit> . lps also induce apoptosis in human endothelial cells  <cit> . brain endothelial cell damage during septic shock has also been noticed in clinical patients  <cit> . lps triggering brain cell death was observed by de bock and coworkers  <cit> , who found that lps endotoxic insult caused neuronal death in cultured organotypic hippocampal slices obtained from 7-day old neonatal rats dependent on the synthesis of tumor necrosis factor alpha   <cit> . lps was also reported to induce death of glial cells in freshly isolated rat neonatal white matter in a dose-dependent fashion  <cit> . lps encephalic injection induced endothelial cell and astrocyte injury with increase in blood-brain barrier permeability in rat models  <cit> . lps astrocyte injury was also indicated in large animals in vivo. oikawa and coworkers  <cit>  found that septic shock, featured as edema around arterioles and hemorrhages around veins in the brain of horses after systemic administration of lps  <cit> . astrocytes are mainly layered around the blood vessels in the brain. the edema and hemorrhage zones indicate the involvement of astrocytes.

astrocytes  are a subtype of the glial cells in the brain and star-shaped with many functions, including biochemical support of endothelial cells forming the blood-brain barrier, provision of nutrients to the nervous tissue, and a principal role in the repair and scarring process. astrocytes are the major type of cells around blood vessels in the brain and form the blood-brain barrier with blood vessel endothelial cells. therefore, in systemically induced or infected endotoxemia, astrocytes will be the direct defense-line of the brain after endothelium being compromised to lps. when the defensive line of astrocytes is compromised, the brain parenchyma becomes very susceptible to pathogen infection. while lps causes endothelial cell death both in vivo and in vitro  <cit> , astrocyte derivative cell lines such as human cell lines t98g and a <dig>  rat cell lines c <dig> and immortalized rat astrocytes are broadly used in lps treated experiments, and no cell injury has been reported  <cit> . if lps does not cause astrocyte injury in vitro, how could lps cause astrocyte injury in vivo in the animal tests? whether systemic administration of lps could result in brain parenchyma damage also becomes a question.

previous publications indicate that lps alone would not cause cell death, but lps combined with cytokines, i.g., interferon-γ  would cause decrease in viability of rat c <dig> and rat primary astrocytes  <cit> . those reports indicate a much more complex mechanism of lps on astroctyte injury compared to lps causing endothelial injury. lps is involved in broad inflammatory responses. therefore, a comprehensive study of inflammation and other relevant factors under lps influence may provide more detailed information about the behavior of astrocytes in sepsis.

the present study was designed to explore lps role in sepsis in a comprehensive way by profiling expression of a highly selected group of genes using an astrocyte model . t98g cell line is a derivative of glioblastoma. its astrocytic origin was confirmed by bignami et al.  <cit> . the cell line has been intensively used as a model to study astrocytes  <cit>  because of its biological resemblance to primary astrocyte. t98g cells express the specific marker of astrocyte, glial fibrillary acidic protein  and share other phenotypes to primary astrocyte such as cd68- and hla-i-  <cit> .

RESULTS
lps potentiates h2o2-caused cell death
without subsequent h2o <dig> exposure, cellular viability was not altered when cells were treated with  <dig> μg/ml lps compared to pbs controls . with higher concentration of lps , it only caused a minor  reduction of cell viability compared to the pbs controls without subsequence h2o <dig> exposure .

by itself, h2o <dig> caused substantial cell death, but this effect was greatly enhanced in cells pretreated by lps . h2o <dig> mediated decrease in cell viability was closely related to lps dose. 1% h2o <dig> treatment caused 36% decrease in cell viability among the cells pretreated with  <dig> μg/ml lps, while  <dig> μg/ml lps caused 50% decrease in cell viability, as compared to the corresponding cells which only treated with lps without subsequent h2o <dig> treatment. in contrast, cell viability only dropped 24% for cells that did not receive lps beforehand. similar patterns were obtained in groups treated with 2% and 3% h2o <dig> 

in all subgroups treated with h2o <dig>  cell viabilities were significantly reduced  in the groups pretreated with lps at as low as  <dig> μg/ml compared with the cells received pbs instead . the same is true for the groups pretreated with  <dig> μg/ml lps versus pbs controls . with the increase in lps dosage, a further increased cell death was observed in those cells which received  <dig> μg/ml lps or  <dig> μg/ml lps and then were exposed to 1% or 2% h2o <dig> . for 3% h2o <dig> treatments, no significant difference was observed between the two lps concentrations, which may be because h2o <dig> induced cell death became predominant. those results suggest that lps pretreatment synergistically enhances the h2o <dig> caused cell death.

lps induced gene expression changes
using multiplex amplification and microarray, we identified  <dig>  mrna species with signals significantly higher than backgrounds  in t98g cells under various conditions . of the  <dig> genes,  <dig>  were down-regulated, while  <dig>  were up-regulated by different lps treatments. in the down-regulated group, the expression of  <dig> out of  <dig> genes began to decrease significantly  at the lower dose of lps , and the rest also showed significant  down-regulation at higher does lps . in the up-regulated group,  <dig> out of  <dig> mrna species began significantly  to raise in response to the lower dose of lps  <dig> μg/ml, while  <dig> increased significantly  at higher dose of lps  .

lps treatments induced alteration in expression for a wide range of genes in the t98g cells, including those relevant to antioxidant, antibacterial, growth factor, apoptosis, gene transcription, brain function, cytoskeletal rearrangement, astrocytic differentiation, transfer of cargo between intracellular membranes of organelles, cell adhesion, cell cycle regulation, pro-inflammatory cytokines, etc. .

amidst the group of genes down regulated by lps, the ones related to antioxidation were outstanding . these genes included:  glutathione s-transferase a- <dig> , a member of the glutathione s-transferase family, crucially associated with glutathione antioxidantion  <cit> ,  kinase c-epsilon  that functions to prevent cell injury from ischemia-reperfusion like insult  <cit> ,  cytochrome b <dig>  that is a ferric reductase to maintain ferrous-ferric homeostasis in cells  <cit> . decreased ferrous/ferric ratio was observed in neuronal degeneration diseases  <cit> , indicating the deficiency in the antioxidant in the affected patients,  vasoactive intestinal peptide  type  <dig> receptor , which is the major type of receptor mediating vip activity. vip which was reported to have antioxidant effect on inhibition of inf-γ stimulated nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate  oxidative pathways in murine macrophages  <cit> ,  macrophage stimulating protein , which is also known as hepatocyte growth factor-like protein, and was reported to inhibit the production of nitric oxide , a reactive oxygen species, in the injured hypoglossal nuclei  <cit> . in contrast, endothelial nitric oxide synthase  is significantly increased after the lps treatment. the above data imply a decreased antioxidant capacity in the lps treated astrocytes.

correlation between down-regulated genes and cell viability after h2o <dig> treatment
as pearson product-moment correlation coefficient r >  <dig>   was used as the significance level cutoff, amidst the down-regulated genes,  <dig> are significantly correlated with cell viability, while only one gene whose expression is significantly correlated with cell viability in the up-regulated group .

*genes with a pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient  >  <dig>  are listed. those with coefficient r >  <dig>   are in bold face.

interestingly, the r values for cytochrome b <dig>  the ferric reductase, are  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  in the groups treated with pbs, 1%, 2% and 3% h2o <dig>  respectively , indicating a strong intrinsic association of cytochrome b <dig> gene expression and cell viability. vip receptor  <dig> displays an r of  <dig>  in the 3% h2o <dig> treated group . the other antioxidant genes also had high r values although are not significant. for instance, r values for gsta <dig>  prkc, and mst <dig> are  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  in the 3% h2o <dig> treated groups, respectively .

other impressive genes with their expression highly correlated with cell viability are growth factors, including c-fos induced growth factor , growth factor receptor-bound protein  <dig> , insulin-like growth factor binding protein  <dig> , v-fos fbj murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog  and fbj murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog b . . the expression of figf and fos achieved a significant level to correlate with cell viability, while fosb, grb <dig> and igfbp <dig> show high, but not significant r values of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, in the 3% h2o <dig> group . the gene expressions of growth factor receptor-bound protein  <dig>  and insulin-like growth factor binding protein  <dig>  also showed high correlation with t98g cell viability . the gene products of those two genes are involved in cross-talking of growth factor pathway and other pathways  <cit> . decline of somatostatin receptor  <dig>  gene expression was reported to be associated with brain cell injury  <cit> . in the present study, sstr <dig> gene expression showed significant correlation with t98g cell viability in 1% h2o <dig> . nerve growth factor was detected in the present study, but its gene expression appeared not to be affected by lps treatment , implying nerve growth factor may not be involved in causing astrocyte death in sepsis at the gene expression level.

*u/a, unaffected. u/d, undetectable

the present study indicates that astrocytes may not be the major source to release chemotactic factors, and therefore, they may not actively recruit monocytes and neutrophils to the site under lps treatment. our results indicate that gene expression of il1b, il <dig> and il <dig> were suppressed by lps, while mrnas of il <dig>  il <dig>  il <dig>  il <dig>  il <dig> and il <dig> were not detectable in t98g cells . il <dig> expression was increased by lps treatment , which is consistent to the notion that il <dig> is expressed in astrocytes under inflammatory stimuli  <cit> . interestingly, the il <dig> generated by astrocytes in response to inflammation may have a protective function for survival of oligodendroglia that myolinated the axons of neurons  <cit> . the lps induced il <dig> gene expression may reflect a cell protective mechanism in sepsis.

several tumor necrosis factor  family members were included in the present study. gene expression of tnfα, the most studied cytokine involved in inflammation and cell death, was not detectable in t98g cells, while gene expression of its receptors, tnfr <dig> and tnfr <dig> were unaffected by the lps treatment, indicating cell death induced in the present study was independent of gene expressions of tnfα, tnfr <dig> and tnfr <dig> of t98g . gene expression of tnf ligand superfamily member  <dig>  was increased as the lps dose increased, but did not show meaningful correlation with the cell viability . tnfsf <dig> which is a homolog of lymphotoxin was reported to inhibit tumor growth  <cit> . considering the cancerous nature of t98g cell, lps induced tnfsf <dig> expression may imply brain tumor suppression function in some cases  <cit> . conspicuously, cyclooxygenase  <dig>  gene expression was significantly suppressed by lps pretreatment , though the suppression level was not significantly correlated with cell viability. the gene of cox <dig> is broadly expressed in cancers and is suggested to be a potent enzyme in arachidonic acid metabolism to favor the tumor growing  <cit> . our results are in consistent with the anticancerous effect of lps  <cit> .

with the undetectable or unaffected mrnas of tnfα and its receptors under lps treatment, caspase  <dig> and caspase  <dig>  the key factors to mediate apoptotic signals from the tnf family  <cit> , was also unaffected by the lps in their gene expression . bcl- <dig> family plays crucial roles in pro- or anti-apoptosis  <cit> . neither mrna of bcl-w, a factor functioning in blocking apoptosis, nor mrna of bad, the factor playing an opposite role as to bcl-w, was affected by lps . markedly, gene expression of bcl- <dig> binding component  <dig> , a strong pro-apoptotic factor, was induced by lps . the bbc <dig> gene is a direct target of p <dig> and is also induced by p <dig> independent apoptotic stimuli such as dexamethason treatment and serum deprivation  <cit> . interestingly, its expression could be suppressed by growth factors  <cit> , which may coordinate the growth factor suppression in the present study. the bbc <dig> gene expression does not show a correlation with the cell death, indicating the possibility of multiple regulation levels involved in the cell death resulted from lps coupled with h2o <dig> treatment.

discussion
our results showed that lps itself was insufficient to cause t98g cell death. however, when subsequently treated with h2o <dig>  the lps effect in inducing cell death could be significantly enhanced, which might be underlain by altered gene expression through pre-exposure of lps. in systemic sepsis, lps first accesses the endothelial layer of the blood-brain barrier. in addition to cell death leading to compromise integrity of endothelial layer in the blood-brain barrier, the permeability of the vascular barrier can also be changed in response to lps via paracelluar permeability. the paracellular pathway is composed of both tight junctions and adherens junctions between endothelial cells. these inter-endothelial junctions are compromised under lps stimulation and leaky to liquid and solutes  <cit> . in this case, astrosytes are exposed to lps directly.

lps treatment suppressed expression of antioxidant genes such as cyb <dig>  gsta <dig>  prkce, mst <dig> and vipr <dig> . suppression of antioxidant gene expression subjects the cells to increased oxidative stress. when this happens in astrocytes, lps may simultaneously stimulate neighboring cells, i.e., endothelial cells to release chemotactic factors such as tnfα, il-1β, inf-γ to attract monocytes and nerutrophils to the niche. subsequently, monocytes and neutrophils are triggered by lps and proinflammatory cytokines to generate h2o <dig>  in the brain, microglial cells are the member of the monocyte/macrophage family and it may be activated by lps to generate h2o <dig> in order to destroy invading bacteria but may cause injury to brain tissues as well  <cit> . the coexistence of microglia may explain lps induced cell death in cultured brain slices and in freshly isolated white matter glial cells  <cit> .

cyt b <dig>  gsta <dig> and prkce are not directly associated with no pathways, though an increase in no generation was observed under lps stimulation in macrophage/monocyte  <cit> , neutrophil  <cit>  and even astrocyte  <cit>  via inducible nitric oxide synthase . lps as an exogenous inducing factor to inos has long been established. therefore, inos was not included in the present study. the scavenging of h2o <dig> may reduce the tissue level of superoxide  on a stoichiometric basis because it is produced from o <dig>  catalyzed by superoxide dismutase. it is plausible that a reduction of tissue o <dig>  may reduce the production of peroxinitrite that is produced by interaction of o <dig>  and no and is a major toxic metabolite of no causing cell injury  <cit> . moreover, mst <dig> is known to inhibit the production of no  <cit> . its gene expression is also down regulated by the lps with an r value of  <dig>  correlated with cell death in the present study, indicating that a weakened defensiveness to no and its toxic metabolites may also occur in astrocyte under lps stress.

furthermore, the present study showed that lps suppressed gene expression of growth factors and associated factors. among the suppressed genes, gene product of figf was reported to be a survival factor in human cell lines by increasing bcl- <dig> expression, decreasing caspase activities and inhibition of poly polymerase cleavage to resist hypoxia and chemical induced cell death  <cit> . fos is a cellular proto-oncogene belonging to the immediate early gene family of transcription factors in response to growth factor and other stimuli  <cit> . the fos gene family is comprised of four members: fos, fosb, fosl <dig>  and fosl <dig>  which encode leucine zipper proteins that can dimerize with proteins of the jun family, thereby forming the transcription factor complex ap- <dig>  regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and transformation  <cit> . fosb encoded by fosb acts as a regulator in cell proliferation, differentiation, and transformation  <cit> . grb <dig> is a plasma protein involved in mediating growth factor signals via promoting growth factor induced growth-receptor endocytosis  <cit>  and interacting with ras as well as p21-activated kinase  <dig>  to weave the growth factor pathways  <cit> . igfbp <dig> was reported to play a key role in driving glioma cell growth via activation of the akt pathway and to collaborate with k-ras or platelet-derived growth factor β in the development and progression of glioma  <cit> . in consistent with the previous studies that expression of sstr <dig> declined in brain cells in rat trauma model and was associated with brain cell injury  <cit> , the sstr <dig> gene expression displayed significant correlation with cell viability in 1% h2o <dig> in our present study . since sstr <dig> was reported to have neuroprotective potential  <cit> , suppression of sstr <dig> gene expression may also contribute to astrocyte death in the present study.

the present study outlines a rational profile on the possible mechanisms that lps compromises the blood-brain barrier during sepsis. suppression of antioxidant gene expression of cyb <dig>  gsta <dig>  and prkce indicates a reduction of cell antioxidative capacity. furthermore, the co-suppression of growth factors and related factors such as figf, fos, fosb, grb <dig> and igfbp <dig> may further weaken the cell survival ability to resist harsh stress such as that caused by h2o <dig>  growth factors are involved in broad functions in maintaining cell survive. in addition to regulate bcl- <dig> and caspase activities, and inhibition of poly polymerase cleavage  <cit> , growth factor may also promote glutathione redox cycling. for instance, nerve growth factor has potent effect to resist h2o <dig> damage on neurons via a rapid activation of glutathione redox cycling  <cit> , indicating the direct effect of growth factor to protect cells from reactive oxygen species. interestingly, in the present study, gene expression of nerve growth factor was not affected by lps , indicating gene expression of nerve growth factor may not be an lps target to induce the astrocyte death.

CONCLUSIONS
the facts of lps suppression of genes encoding antioxidant factors and growth factors, and h2o <dig> enhancement of the lps pretreated cell death suggest a possible crucial mechanism causing blood-brain barrier damage in sepsis and at least in part explains the previously described discrepancy why lps cause brain cell injury in vivo or in organ culture, but not remarkable with culture astrocytes. when lps is systemically administered, monocytes and neutrophils may be recruited into the inflammatory niche. these cells may subsequently, generate h2o <dig> to trigger cell death. in brain slice organ culture, in addition to the possibly remaining monocytes and macrophages, microglial cells could be the principal source to generate reactive oxygen species in the presence of lps  <cit> . these results may shed light on the therapeutic strategies in septic shock patients, though further studies including in vivo studies are needed to define the detailed pathways as well as regulations at the translation and protein-function levels in mediation of astrocyte death.
