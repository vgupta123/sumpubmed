BACKGROUND
acute lymphoblastic leukemia  is the most common childhood malignancy and is diagnosed in about  <dig> children in france every year  <cit> . most of these malignancies  involve the b lineage  and children have a good expected outcome on most treatment protocols. however, b-all is a heterogeneous disease, and therapeutically relevant standard and high-risk group categories  have been defined according to characteristics at diagnosis . in pediatric all, the t chromosomal translocation is the most frequent and is found in about 25% of b-all cases; this translocation involves the fusion of the etv <dig>  and runx <dig>  genes. most treatment protocols result in a good outcome for tel/aml1-positive all patients, but tel/aml <dig> translocation is not currently used as a stratifying marker in most therapeutical protocols  <cit> . thus, clinical features of tel/aml1-positive patients determine whether they are in the sr or hr category. the tel/aml <dig> fusion may therefore not be the single key molecular event causing leukemia spread, and if this is the case, tel/aml1-positive all might involve other critical gene modifications; any such modifications remain to be documented  <cit> .

dna-based microarrays can be used to study the expression levels of thousands of genes and to screen genes with different expression profiles in a single experiment. we therefore used this method to investigate the molecular pathways characterizing tel/aml1-positive leukemia. this approach, using either one-color  or two-color  microarray technologies, has been widely used for refining the diagnosis of all and for predicting the response of all patients to treatment  <cit> . the first studies described gene expression patterns that could be used to distinguish leukemic blast lineages  <cit> , and subsequent studies identified various gene expression signatures characterizing relevant clinical leukemia subtypes, in particular the e2a/pbx <dig>  bcr/abl, tel/aml <dig> and mll rearrangements  <cit> .

we carried out a prospective multicentric study on childhood b-all leukemia to elucidate the molecular processes involved in tel/aml1-positive leukemia. all the patients included in this study received treatment according to the french fralle  <dig> trial. we used agilent whole-genome oligo-chips  to compare the gene expression signatures of tel/aml1-positive patients to those of tel/aml1-negative patients with no recurrent chimeric products irrespective of their clinical risk category. previous microarray gene expression studies  <cit>  had revealed the effect of chromosomal alteration on transcription profiles, so we excluded from our cohort those patients with other recurrent chromosomal translocations or fusion transcripts . we then searched for the biological pathways associated with genes differentially expressed in tel/aml1-positive leukemia .

RESULTS
patient selection
sixty patients with b-lineage all who were treated between  <dig> and  <dig> according to the fralle  <dig> protocol were included in the study. the clinical and biological characteristics of the  <dig> patients are summarized in table  <dig>  microarray data were obtained for  <dig> patients; the patients were grouped into two sets  according to inclusion date. genes of interest were selected using data set-a and tested using data set-b. set-a comprised  <dig> patients included over the three-year period up to december 2004:  <dig> of these patients, including six presenting a tel/aml <dig> rearrangement, were in the standard-risk group , and seven, including one presenting a tel/aml <dig> rearrangement, belonged to the high-risk group . set-b comprised seven patients included in 2005: five, including one presenting a tel/aml <dig> rearrangement, belonged to the sr group; and two, including one presenting a tel/aml <dig> rearrangement, belonged to the hr group. in addition to microarray investigations with these patients, we performed quantitative-rt-pcr with samples from an independent set of  <dig> patients , including seven tel/aml1-positive patients. none had cns involvement. with the exception of two tel/aml1-negative patients , all patients were good early responders to treatment, and other than the tel/aml1-negative hr patient  <dig>  all set-a patients were in a first complete remission phase, with a median follow-up of  <dig> months, at the time of the study.

wbc: white blood cell count; f:female, m:male

hr and sr are respectively high risk and standard risk groups according to the fralle  <dig> trial.

• hr: age ≥  <dig> years, or white blood cell count ≥  <dig> × 109/l, or central nervous system involvement, or t, or t or mll rearrangement, or hypoploidy 

• sr:  <dig> ≤ age <  <dig> years, and white blood cell count <  <dig> × 109/l, and no central nervous system involvement, and none of the following cytogenetic features: t, t or mll rearrangement, hypoploïdy

• tel/aml1-positive all and tel/aml1-negative all can be assigned to hr or sr categories, according to clinical features.

gene expression patterns clearly distinguished tel/aml1-positive leukemia from leukemia without recurrent chromosomal abnormalities
to identify genes with expression profiles that differentiate tel/aml1-positive patients from tel/aml1-negative patients with no recurrent chromosomal abnormalities we used data set-a. we selected  <dig> gene signals that displayed log-ratio intensities that were significantly different from the mean  for at least one array. only  <dig> gene signals, those present on at least 70% of the set-a arrays, were retained for sam analysis. two preliminary two-class sam were performed, comparing tel/aml1-positive patient data to either tel/aml1-negative hr or sr patient data to assess specific sample behavior in a more homogeneous situation than the pooled tel/aml1-negative hr and sr group  <cit> . interestingly, we found that patient  <dig>  the only tel/aml1-positive hr patient  segregated with the tel/aml1-positive sr group and not with the hr patient group. this is consistent with the fusion transcript affecting the gene expression profile . similarly, we found that patient  <dig>  a tel/aml1-negative patient, clustered within the tel/aml <dig> branch and that patient  <dig>  a tel/aml1-postive patient, did not segregate into the tel/aml <dig> branch. rt-pcr, using a different set of primers in a different laboratory, confirmed the presence of a tel/aml <dig> transcript in patient  <dig> and its absence from patient 9; this indicates some heterogeneity in the tel/aml <dig> group . to avoid heterogeneity bias associated with particular patients and to highlight general processes, patients  <dig> and  <dig> were withdrawn from the two-class sam gene-selection step comparing the tel/aml1-positive group with the tel/aml1-negative group. however, the data for these two patients were included in the final hc representation. to increase the robustness of gene-selection step, two cut-offs were applied successively, consistent with a  <dig> -fold change, to exclude genes that varied little between the samples, , with or without a q-value filter  limiting the number of genes selected . this gave two tel/aml <dig> gene sets, one of  <dig> genes and the other of  <dig> genes. these gene sets were used for hierarchical clustering representation of patient set-a. because the set-a cohort was small, we validated our second selection  by estimating the benjamini and hochberg false discovery rate : this value was consistently low . both gene sets  were able to cluster the tel/aml1-positive set-a patients, other than patients  <dig> and  <dig>  in one branch. hierarchical clustering highlighted  <dig> distinct genes among the  <dig> selected and they were separated into two clusters . with the group of  <dig> selected genes, hierarchical clustering highlighted two clusters  able to group tel/aml1-positive all  . a resampling-based procedure  was used to assess reproducibility . only these two restricted gene sets, of  <dig> and  <dig> genes, which correspond to a different profile of expression behavior associated with the presence of a tel/aml <dig> chromosomal rearrangement, were able on their own to cluster the tel/aml <dig> set-a patients as previously and the tel/aml <dig> set-b patients into one branch. they were also able to segregate, with 100% reproducibility, the tel/aml <dig> set-a and -b patients together in the same branch, with the exceptions of patients  <dig> and  <dig> .

identification of genes characterizing pathways specific to tel/aml1-positive lymphoblasts
we investigated the molecular pathways depicting tel/aml1-positive lymphoblasts by characterizing the tel/aml <dig> gene sets of  <dig> and  <dig> genes identified above according to their gene ontology  annotations. five enriched go categories were revealed: cell differentiation, cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell motility and response to wounding. cell motility only concerned the set of  <dig> genes, whereas the other biological processes were obtained with both  <dig> and  <dig> gene sets. sixteen annotated genes were associated with these biological processes : the literature indicates that  <dig> genes may be involved in b lymphoblast cell biology, but that the other two genes, mdk and ntng <dig>  are not. both these genes are mainly expressed in the nervous system. their expression in tel/aml1-positive b-lymphoblast cells may thus be a consequence of the alteration of cell differentiation and proliferation process rather than indicating that they have a particular function in the tel/aml <dig> process. therefore, we did not include them in subsequent analyses and focused on the  <dig> apparently biologically relevant genes . over-expression of runx <dig>  cbfa2t <dig>  tcfl <dig>  tnfrsf <dig> and concomitant under-expression of cd <dig> characterize cell proliferation and differentiation processes in the hematopoietic lineages. over-expression of the scarb <dig>  tp53inp <dig>  acvr1c and pik3c <dig> genes correlates with cell survival. over-expression of the egf <dig>  sema6a and ctgf genes with concomitant under-expression of the lsp <dig> and cd <dig> genes is characteristic of cell migration and response to wounding.

the expression of all the selected genes differs by than  <dig> -fold between tel/aml1-positive all and tel/aml1-negative all groups.

validation of biologically relevant genes
we validated the microarray results in two steps. first, we used a new microarray data set  to perform clustering analysis based on the  <dig> selected genes . confirming the set-a results, the tel/aml1-positive all patients were grouped together in one branch  separate from tel/aml1-negative all patients, whose blast cells did not contain any recurrent chromosomal translocation. additionally, hierarchical clustering and bootstrapping of data for set-a and set-b patients, using these  <dig> genes, satisfactorily segregated the tel/aml1-positive patients into one branch . as in the analysis described above, patient  <dig>  and patient  <dig>  did not classify according to their chromosomal rearrangement.

second, gene expressions were quantified using real-time rt-pcr with the independent set-c patients. nine genes  were chosen from the  <dig> selected above as being the most relevant biologically and able on their own to segregate set-a and -b patients into appropriate clusters . despite the genetic variability observed within each group , the mean gene expression values were significant according to student's t-test, with either a p <  <dig>  or <  <dig> . tcfl <dig>  pik3c <dig>  cbfa2t <dig>  runx <dig>  egfl <dig>  tp53inp <dig> and tnfrsf <dig> were over-expressed and cd <dig> and lsp <dig> under-expressed in the tel/aml1-positive all relative to the tel/aml1-negative subgroup, consistent with the microarray findings . hierarchical clustering of set-c patient data using these nine genes segregated tel/aml1-positive patients into one distinct branch .

relationship between microarray data and cytogenetic data
we then examined the cytogenetic data to document tel/aml <dig>  patient clustering further. fish analysis revealed that patient  <dig>  who did not display a t translocation but systematically clustered with the tel/aml <dig> branch, presented a tetrasomy of the aml <dig>  gene . this over-represented runx <dig> gene is consistent with the over-expression of runx <dig> seen on the microarray . similarly, patient  <dig>  who displayed a t translocation and systematically clustered with the tel/aml1-negative subgroup, had a low level of runx <dig> expression  and only two runx <dig> gene copies , even though three chromosomes  <dig> were detected  . fish analysis of the remaining tel/aml1-positive patients  revealed the presence of three runx <dig> gene copies in three patients . patients  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> presented a deletion of the native tel.

fish experiments determined aml <dig>  gene copy number and revealed whether or not native tel  was deleted. increased aml <dig> copy number was scored when present in more than 50% of the cell population.

discussion
the pediatric tel/aml1-positive b-all subgroup displays fairly uniform clinical features, making it appropriate for studying the development of this sub-type of all. comparison of gene expression profiles in tel/aml1-positive patients with those in tel/aml1-negative patients, whose blast cells do not contain any recurrent chromosomal rearrangement, is potentially informative about the molecular processes and pathogenesis of tel/aml <dig>  we first obtained microarray data for  <dig> b-all patients included in our prospective study. these patients constituted a homogeneous group, receiving an identical treatment according to the fralle  <dig> trial. gene expression analysis followed by gene enrichment analysis allowed us to identify five discrete enriched go categories – cell differentiation, cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell motility and response to wounding – that highlighted the tel/aml <dig> biological processes. the go categories identified were associated with  <dig> annotated genes ; the expression patterns of these selected genes allowed clustering of the tel/aml1-positive set-a patients into one branch. the expression patterns of these genes, as assessed either by microarray experiments or real-time rt-pcr, were also able to cluster the tel/aml1-positive patients of two independent sets, set-b and -c, into one branch. thus, even though the size of the initial set was relatively small, the filters applied were stringent enough to limit the number of false positives, leading to accuracy and subsequent validation of the  <dig> annotated genes. furthermore, six of the  <dig> tel/aml1-selected genes  had previously been reported to be associated with tel/aml <dig> signatures found in more heterogeneous groups of all patients   <cit> . the identification of the same genes through different experimental approaches  and in different patient sets is a strong argument for their importance in tel/aml1-positive leukemia process  <cit> , and for the relevance of the additional eight newly identified genes . some genes previously described as relevant, including terf <dig> and epor, did not appear among the genes we selected. this might be due to differences in patient sets , or to differences in the affinities of the probe sets used  <cit> . our findings reveal new target genes characterizing limited and specific biological pathways associated with tel/aml <dig> pathogenesis. further in vivo and in vitro investigations to assess their biological effects should contribute to a better understanding of the disease.

models of all pathogenesis have suggested that two classes of cooperating mutations are required for acute leukemia to develop  <cit> : one involved in impairment of differentiation and the other in cell proliferation and/or survival. we found that differentiation was not inhibited in tel/aml1-positive all patients but, rather, was enhanced and characterized by the over-expression of differentiation genes . this is in agreement with the report by pine et al  <cit>  that tel/aml <dig> fusion preceded differentiation to pre-b cells and suggests that tel/aml <dig> fusion occurs in a totipotent hematopoietic progenitor cell and directs cell differentiation towards the b-lineage. we also highlighted the activation of proliferation/survival oncogenic processes with the up-regulation of the runx <dig>  cbfa2t <dig>  pik3ct, scarb <dig> and tp53inp <dig> genes. our study also implicated cell motility and response to wounding processes in the tel/aml <dig> cluster. cell migration capacity may be a clue to explaining the very late relapse events, which affect some tel/aml1-positive all patients. indeed, the good outcome expected for tel/aml1-positive all children is offset by the relatively high rate of very late relapse, especially in non-hematopoietic sites such as the ovary  <cit> .

additional genetic changes are very common in tel/aml1-positive all patients; about 70% also present with deletion of the second tel gene  on the non-rearranged chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . about half tel/aml1-positive patients  displayed an additional loss of the tel gene, suggesting that there may be other genetic abnormalities acting as secondary events for tel/aml <dig> leukemogenesis or contributing to the outcome. unlike the tel gene, the aml <dig> gene  was significantly over-expressed in the tel/aml <dig> cluster. runx <dig> is a member of the runt transcription factor family and targets key regulators of the hematopoiesis process  through its dna-binding domain  <cit> . the transcriptional activity of runx <dig> depends on its dimerization with the non-dna binding factor cbfβ, and on the recruitment of co-factors. the runx <dig> transcription complex thus acts either as a transcriptional activator or as a repressor depending on the nature of the co-factors. the tel/aml <dig> fusion protein  associated with the t translocation acts as a repressor. however, few of the genes selected in our analysis were down-regulated. this suggests that either gene up-regulation is an indirect process, dependent on the down-regulation of transcriptional repressors mediated by the tel/aml <dig> fusion protein, or that the repressor function of the tel/aml <dig> fusion protein is counterbalanced by the presence of a normal runx <dig> protein. this later possibility is supported by our observation of runx <dig> over-expression in the tel/aml1-positive group by microarray experiments and q-pcr. expression and cytogenetic data from patients  <dig> and  <dig> indicate that runx <dig> over-expression is not due to the expression of the tel/aml <dig>  fusion gene, driven by the tel promoter, but to the native runx <dig> gene. an increased runx <dig> copy number was also found in one third of the tel/aml <dig> patients, and this may explain, at least in part, runx <dig> over-expression. gene amplification is a common mechanism of oncogene deregulation, which occurs with runx <dig> through chromosome  <dig> polysomy, by the presence of a runx <dig> tandem repeat on der or with additional runx <dig> copies on extra-chromosomal elements  <cit> . the over-expression of the runx <dig> gene with no apparent amplification of the runx <dig> locus also suggests that there may be cryptic amplification undetectable by fish-analysis or deregulation of the runx <dig> promoter. conversely, promoter silencing or gene deletion despite over-representation of chromosome- <dig> could explain low expression of the runx <dig> gene. runx <dig> over-expression appeared to be characteristic of the tel/aml1-positive patient group. indeed, all patients with runx <dig> over-expression clustered together, including the patient  <dig>  who had four copies of runx <dig> but no tel/aml <dig> fusion. by contrast, tel/aml1-positive patient  <dig>  who presents no runx <dig> over-expression, did not segregate with the tel/aml1-positive group. it is possible that the expression levels of runx <dig> could explain the clinical heterogeneity of t all cases. indeed, it has been suspected that a runx <dig> gene copy number of four is associated with all with good prognosis. by contrast, whereas the amplification of runx <dig> to a copy number greater than four, which has been estimated to be the case in 2% of all pediatric all and particularly those with no tel/aml <dig> chromosomal aberration, may be characteristic of a subtype of b-all associated with a poor prognosis  <cit> . if these findings were confirmed, the tel/aml <dig> fusion transcript and runx <dig> expression level data could be used as stratifying therapeutical markers, with possible prognostic value.

CONCLUSIONS
gene expression analysis of tel/aml <dig> all identified five enriched gene ontology  categories: cell differentiation, cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell motility and response to wounding, associated with fourteen genes able to cluster the tel/aml <dig> sub-group . these results, based on a small cohort, but validated by two independent data sets, should serve as a basis for a better understanding of tel/aml <dig> pathogenesis and the biology of late relapse.
