BACKGROUND
the eastern and western mosquitofish  are members of the live bearer family poeciliidae that are collectively the most widely distributed freshwater fish species in the world  <cit> . males and females are small in size  and exhibit sexual dimorphism. sexually-mature male mosquitofish have an elongation of anal fin rays  <dig>   <dig>  and 5; this structure is referred to as the gonopodium and is used by males for internal fertilization of females  <cit> . abnormal anal fin growth which resembles the male gonopodium can be induced in female mosquitofish by exposure to androgenic compounds  <cit> .

mosquitofish attracted the attention of environmental toxicologists after the discovery of abnormally elongated anal fins on female g. holbrooki residing downstream of a pulp and paper mill in florida  <cit> . it was hypothesized that these fish were exposed to an androgenic chemical since male sex steroids induce similar phenotypes  <cit> . studies utilizing the mosquitofish as a bioindicator for evaluating the impacts of paper mill effluent exposure have provided useful information on the evaluation of the physiological impacts of this exposure  <cit> ; however, the identification of the chemical or class of chemicals inducing the abnormal elongation could not be elucidated from these studies.

the development and usage of gene expression biomarkers can provide knowledge on the effects at a molecular level that chemicals have on an organism  <cit> . traditionally, biomarkers have been found with a gene-by-gene approach by utilizing knowledge on mechanisms of action to determine potential biomarker genes. a classic example in the field of ecotoxicology is hepatic expression of the egg yolk precursor protein vitellogenin , a gene normally only expressed in female fish but whose expression in males can be driven by exogenous exposure to estrogenic compounds  <cit> . for mosquitofish, potential biomarkers of androgen exposure that are expressed in the androgen-sensitive anal fin tissue include sonic hedgehog , fibroblast growth factor receptor  <dig> , and muscle segment homeobox c   <cit> . while this gene-by-gene approach has been useful in the past, a method that includes the analysis of many genes at a single time could generate larger data sets for more quickly developing tools to evaluate the impacts of chemical stressors in the environment.

microarray technologies provide a way of evaluating the expression of thousands of genes in a single sample. this platform has enabled the field of ecotoxicology to develop chemical gene expression signatures, to better understand the mechanisms of action of chemical exposure, and to elucidate potential biomarker genes  <cit> . while there are commercial microarrays for several model organisms such as zebrafish , medaka , and the fathead minnow  and for commercially-important species including the atlantic salmon  and largemouth bass   <cit> , there is currently no microarray for g. holbrooki or g. affinis. this type of molecular tool could be used to further develop the mosquitofish as a robust bioindicator organism for endocrine disrupting chemicals  by providing a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of chemical exposure on this species and can provide a means to elucidate potential androgen biomarker genes.

the objective of this study was to develop and utilize a mosquitofish microarray to determine potential biomarkers of subchronic androgen exposure. to achieve this objective, two specific aims were developed: 1) sequence a g. holbrooki cdna library, and 2) use microarray analysis to determine genes that are differentially regulated by subchronic androgen exposure in hepatic tissues of 17β-trenbolone  exposed adult female g. holbrooki. by using the custom g. holbrooki microarray, we identified a set of genes that were significantly differentially regulated after 14 days of tb exposure and hypothesize that these genes could be used as androgenic biomarkers.

RESULTS
g. holbrooki cdna library sequencing and microarray construction
table  <dig> depicts the results of the two sequencing analyses that were conducted. over  <dig>  contigs were obtained from the combined  <dig> xlr <dig> gs-flx and illumina gaiix sequencing runs, with a greater number of large contigs obtained using the  <dig> xlr <dig> gs-flx. in total,  <dig>  sequences were obtained from both the  <dig> and illumina runs after co-assembly of the two data sets using pta, with  <dig>  final assemblies passing quality control checks and used for annotation analysis. after annotation,  <dig>  sequences were found which had an e-score of ≤ 10- <dig>  indicating that these sequences were well-annotated and appropriate for inclusion in the microarray.

the gene selection for microarray design was based on the strength of gene annotation. to find a maximum set of non-redundant sequences representing unique genes, we selected a subset of genes for probe design from the blast results with e-values of  ≤ e- <dig> to ≤ e- <dig> as the cut-off thresholds in the nr & nt search and refseq search respectively. selected sequences were chosen in order to obtain an overall breadth of diverse biological and molecular pathways. 60-mer gene probes were designed for  <dig>  genes for the microarray using earray . the microarray platform  and resulting data set  were submitted to the gene expression omnibus  database. all reporting and depositing of microarray information was conducted per the guidelines of the minimum information about a microarray experiment   <cit> .

microarray analysis of hepatic gene expression patterns
figure  <dig> depicts the differentially-regulated transcripts by 1 μg tb/l exposure with a greater than  <dig>  fold increase or a less than − <dig>  fold decrease from the controls which were significantly different between treatments , p <  <dig> , false discovery rate α =  <dig> ). distinct hepatic gene expression profiles between the two treatment groups were visualized using hierarchical cluster analysis . under these conditions,  <dig> genes were down-regulated by tb as compared to the vehicle control and  <dig> genes were up-regulated by exposure to tb. a list of all significant differentially-regulated transcripts with a greater than  <dig>  fold increase or a less than − <dig>  fold decrease from the controls can be found in the supplemental materials .

table  <dig> demonstrates the gene ontology  biological process categories that were significantly enriched by tb exposure as determined by gene set enrichment analysis. the percent of transcripts differentially regulated  versus those which were not differentially regulated ’ associated with each go category are also included in the table. these results demonstrate the percentage of genes within a go category which were significantly differentially regulated  versus genes within the go category that were on the array which were not significant. fifteen biological processes were enriched by tb exposure . many of these processes are related to metabolism and metabolic processes  and other molecular-level impacts  are also present.

figure  <dig> illustrates the impacts of tb exposure on processes linked to metabolism and biosynthesis using pathwaystudiotm, providing further support for the results of the fisher’s exact test. a significant increase in the processes of cholesterol metabolism, steroid metabolism, and respiratory chain are correlated with an increase in the expression of genes linked to these processes, including many cytochrome p <dig> enzyme subtypes .

real-time quantitative pcr  validation of selected genes
table  <dig> provides the results of the qpcr validation of the expression levels of a subset of genes selected from the microarray data. from the list of significantly up and down-regulated transcripts, five genes were selected for follow-up analysis by qpcr based on the magnitude of change in expression level, their inclusion in a significantly differentially regulated biological process, or relationship to the endocrine system: 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase  <dig> , androgen receptor beta , zona pellucida glycoprotein  <dig> , activating transcription factor  <dig>  and acetyl-coa acyltransferase  <dig> . the ribosomal protein l <dig>  was used for normalization of expression values and data are presented as log2-transformed fold change values. two genes were found to be significantly expressed by qpcr in the same direction of expressional change as in the microarray data set: 17βhsd <dig> and zp <dig> . three genes, atf <dig>  arβ, and acaa <dig> were also expressed in the same direction as the microarray samples, albeit the qpcr results were not statistically significant .

discussion
transcriptomic analyses provide a promising means of furthering the field of environmental toxicology, with several applications having been realized in full and other applications, including biomarker development, having proof-of-concept models in place  <cit> . as researchers continue to branch out into the study of more complex systems and environments, a need for developing molecular tools for environmentally-relevant and non-model species has become evident. in this manuscript we describe the development and use of a custom gene microarray for g. holbrooki, a potential bioindicator organism for edcs. through the sequencing of a g. holbrooki library, we were able to generate gene sequence information for over  <dig>  genes and have developed an  <dig> x  <dig>  gene microarray.

controlled exposures to androgenic compounds provide insightful data on the toxic mechanism of exposures to environmental androgens. this is especially true for mosquitofish, a species with androgen-driven sexual dimorphism. this is significant for environmental health since elongation of the anal fin only found in males is present in populations of female mosquitofish residing downstream of pulp and paper mills with effluents known to contain edcs  <cit> . to better understand the impacts of androgen exposure on g. holbrooki and to determine potential molecular biomarkers of androgen exposure, we analysed gene expression patterns in female g. holbrooki that were exposed for 14 days to 1 μg/l of the potent model androgen tb. a dose and time point was selected that resulted in significant anal fin elongation over the controls to provide a physiological anchor of androgenic effects for these microarray data  <cit> . furthermore, because of our interest in discovering biomarkers that would be expressed during long-term exposures , we chose to conduct a microarray analysis of g. holbrooki that had been exposed for two weeks in lieu of an acute exposure.

previous transcriptomic analysis of tb exposures on the toxicological model species, the fathead minnow , have provided insights into the mechanisms of the endocrine disrupting effects caused by this chemical. analysis of gonadal gene expression profiles in female fathead minnows exposed to 1 μg tb/l for 4 days resulted in a larger number of downregulated go biological processes. many of these processes are similar to those seen up-regulated in the liver of g. holbrooki by a longer term exposure to the same dose of tb . notably, processes related to lipid metabolism and transcription are regulated in different directions  <cit> . this may be due to differences in adaptation between short and longer term exposures, as different compensatory pathways may become activated at early time points and decreased at later time points to ameliorate the biological effects of the exposure  <cit> . this may also be due to differences in the tissue analyzed . in hepatic gene expression analysis of female fathead minnows exposed to  <dig>  μg tb/l for 48 hours, there are strong similarities to the enriched go biological processes that were found in the data set presented in this manuscript. notably, both data sets contain pathways related to lipid metabolism and catabolism, as well as steroid metabolism and biosynthesis .

many of the enriched significant pathways in the mosquitofish tb data were associated with lipid and cholesterol metabolism and were driven by the increased expression of genes such as apolipoprotein a <dig> , phosphatidylcholine-sterol acyltransferase, and lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase . similar results were demonstrated in castrated rats which were fed 1 μg/g of testosterone for 14 days, with increased hepatic synthesis of apoa- <dig> <cit> . as the cholesterogenic pathway is important for its role in producing the precursor chemicals for steroid biosynthesis, the finding that androgen exposure can upregulate pathways involved in cholesterol and lipid metabolism is of interest. even though these two chemicals differ in their ability to become aromatized, with testosterone metabolized to estrogenic forms whereas tb in contrast is non-aromatizable and instead exhibits anti-estrogenic effects  <cit> , the similarities seen in the impacts at the pathway level indicate that androgens elicit their effects via general disruption of metabolism. these include modulations in the go biological processes of lipid metabolic process, cholesterol biosynthetic process, and regulation of protein metabolic process .

significant additional impacts at the gene level can be visualized using pathwaystudio™ and demonstrate the impacts of tb on cytochrome p <dig> enzymes. other studies have also shown an increase in certain subtypes of p450s by tb exposure  <cit>  and the increased expression of these key metabolic genes also feed into many significantly upregulated biological processes, including cholesterol and steroid metabolism . the increase in activities and expression of metabolic pathways and enzymes seen in this manuscript and by other researchers may be a response mechanism by which the cell senses abnormal steroid levels and seeks to develop the appropriate precursor chemicals that can be used to offset the unnatural steroid ratios.

one of the potential uses of –omics data is the investigation of novel biomarkers to evaluate chemical exposures on wildlife  <cit> . one of the most widely used biomarkers of androgen exposure is spiggin, a glycoprotein synthesized in the kidneys of male three-spined stickleback  via androgen signaling  <cit> . in female g. aculeatus, this protein was found to be upregulated in the kidneys after exposure to 1 μg/l of methyltestosterone , 5 μg/l of dihydrotestosterone , and 5 μg/l of tb, with co-treatment of the anti-androgen flutamide  resulting in decreased spiggin protein levels  <cit> . these results indicate that this gene may be a direct target of androgen action and that spiggin has a strong potential to be developed as a robust biomarker for androgen exposure in g. aculeatus. however, this species’ restricted distribution to colder waters and the inability to use this protein in species outside of the stickleback family  imposes limitations for this androgen biomarker’s widespread usage.

expression of the nuclear receptors for androgen ligands, such as androgen receptor β , is another potential biomarker of androgen exposure  <cit> . in g. aculeatus, arβ mrna was expressed in liver tissues at a detectable yet significantly lower level than in the gonads and kidneys, with no significant effects of gender on tissue expression level  <cit> . arβ is also expressed at comparable levels in adult female and male g. affinis fin tissues  <cit>  as well as in androgen-treated anal fins of g. affinis fry  <cit> . in this manuscript, we found a decrease in arβ in the liver, which may be attributed to a negative feedback of the ar-mediated pathway during subchronic androgen exposure. this would indicate that arβ may not be a suitable candidate as an androgen biomarker for use in a field setting where animals have likely been subchronically exposed. previous studies in mosquitofish have evaluated the expression patterns of genes expressed in the anal fin tissue, including shh, msxc, and fgfr <dig> <cit> , but the analysis of genes expressed in the liver are of interest for evaluating androgen biomarkers that can be developed in species other than mosquitofish.

using qpcr, we were able to statistically validate the expression of the genes 17βhsd <dig> and zp <dig>  the 17βhsd <dig> subtype is known to catalyze the reduction of the androgen precursor androstenedione  to testosterone   <cit> . this subtype is predominantly expressed in the testes  <cit>  but is also found at detectable levels in the livers of both male and female zebrafish, albeit at higher levels in males  <cit> . members of this enzyme family are also upregulated in mice adipose tissue after exposure to dht  <cit> . we hypothesize that upregulated expression of this enzyme is a feedback mechanism of the hypothalamus pituitary gonadal  axis in response to changes in levels of sex steroids. changes in sex steroid levels were seen during androgen exposures including a decrease in both t and e <dig> during exposures of female fathead minnows to  <dig>  and 5 μg/l of tb  <cit> . because of its expression in other species and its relationship to the endocrine system, further experimentation on the utility of this gene as a biomarker of subchronic androgen exposure by field work validation is warranted.

during oocyte maturation, zona pellucida  glycoproteins are synthesized in the liver and deposited into the blood, where they are subsequently taken up by gonads  <cit> . zp <dig> was found to be downregulated in the gonads of female fathead minnow exposed to 1 μg tb/l for 4 days  <cit> , and this gene was also decreased in this study. in addition to zp <dig>  the subtype zp3a. <dig> was also found to be downregulated by tb exposure in this microarray data set . also found in female fathead minnows exposed to 1 μg tb/l for 4 days were several forms of the egg yolk precursor protein vtg, which were downregulated by tb exposure, including vtg <dig>  vtg <dig>  and vtg <dig> <cit> . in the previously published study on vtg gene expression in these samples, we found a significant downregulation in vtg <dig> by qpcr  <cit>  and several vtg subtypes were also significantly downregulated in this microarray data set . this decrease is hypothesized to be a result of the indirect anti-estrogenic effects of tb exposure through endpoints such as a decrease in e <dig> levels, which lead to decreased levels of estrogen-regulated genes such as vtg <cit> . in addition, a dysregulation of steroid metabolic enzymes during androgen exposure may also influence the normal activities of the hpg axis  <cit> . future studies evaluating zp <dig> during androgen exposure can provide additional insights into the reproductive impacts of androgenic chemicals on the hpg axis of aquatic organisms and can complement data on vtg in both a laboratory and field setting.

CONCLUSIONS
we developed a custom  <dig> ×  <dig>  gene microarray for g. holbrooki and utilized this microarray to evaluate changes in global hepatic gene expression after exposure to a potent androgen receptor agonist. over  <dig> genes were significant  which had greater than a  <dig>  fold change from the controls. microarray data generated from this study provide insights into the mechanisms of endocrine disruption in this species, most notably the significant upregulation of the biological processes involved in cholesterol and lipid metabolism after subchronic androgen exposure. the similarities in the metabolic pathways being modified during exposure to tb and to other androgenic chemicals provide insights into the biological impacts of androgen exposure. we have validated an increase in the expression of the steroid metabolism gene 17βhsd <dig> and will validate this gene’s expression in future research at paper mill impacted field sites that are believed to be contaminated with androgenic compounds. in addition, we saw a decrease in the expression of numerous subtypes of key genes involved in oocyte development and function such as vtg and zp, suggesting that androgen exposure can negatively impact the reproductive abilities of this species.

the g. holbrooki microarray will allow for this non-model species to become more fully developed into a bioindicator organism for endocrine disrupting pollutants and future studies will enhance knowledge of the biology and toxicological response of this species. while microarray data generated from this and other studies do not provide a full understanding of the molecular mechanism of chemical exposure, it provides a foundation of knowledge and tools that can be used to delve further into understanding the biology of g. holbrooki and how this organism can be used as a robust bioindicator organism for endocrine disrupting pollutants in the environment.
