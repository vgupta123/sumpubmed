BACKGROUND
human eosinophil cationic protein  is an important molecule related to diseases such as asthma and inflammation. it is secreted by activated eosinophils and serves as one of the major components of eosinophil granule proteins
 <cit> . structurally, ecp contains three α-helices, five β-strands, and eight loops
 <cit> , with a molecular mass of 16– <dig> kda, depending on the extent of post-translational modification
 <cit> . also called ribonuclease  <dig> , ecp belongs to the human rnasea superfamily, members of which have very low ribonucleolytic activity but high cytotoxic activity
 <cit> . members of the rnasea superfamily are defined by their similar sequences and structures, and their ribonucleolytic activity regulates gene expression at the mrna level
 <cit> . to date,  <dig> human protein sequences have been found to be similar to bovine pancreatic rnasea
 <cit> . the  <dig> arginine and  <dig> lysine residues in the primary sequence of ecp account for its high isoelectric point 
 <cit> . the highly positive charge carried by ecp contributes to its cytotoxic activity, as it facilitates interaction between ecp and negatively charged molecules, such as heparin sulfate and cell membrane lipids
 <cit> .

through its interaction with carbonhydrate on cell surface, ecp translocates into cells by endocytosis and causes cell damage
 <cit> . this may contribute to airway inflammation during asthma and to damage of the intestinal mucosa in crohn’s disease
 <cit> . the role of ecp in responding to pathogen infection by contributing to innate immune defenses through the removal of invading microorganisms is well documented. the protein is also cytotoxic to parasites, bacteria, viruses, helminths, and mammalian cells
 <cit> . therefore, ecp has been categorized as an antimicrobial peptide . the mechanism of ecp-triggered cell damage is suggested to involve destabilization of cell membrane lipids through pore formation, causing changes in membrane permeability and membrane leakage
 <cit> .

human ecp possesses a 27-amino-acid signal peptide that is cleaved from the rest of the protein by a signal peptidase  in the endoplasmic reticulum . the signal peptide of ecp , which comprises a short, positively charged n-terminal region, a central hydrophobic region, and a polar c-terminal region, leads to the secretion of ecp into the extracellular space. the cytotoxicity of ecpsp inhibits the growth of lower organisms, such as escherichia coli and pichia pastoris, but not that of mammalian cells
 <cit> . this growth inhibition results from the suppression of de novo protein synthesis. cell growth is restored when signal peptide peptidase  and ecpsp are co-expressed in p. pastoris <cit> . cleavage of ecpsp into the ecpsp-1- <dig> and ecpsp-18- <dig> fragments by spp eliminates the cytotoxicity, thus preventing damage to mammalian cells. furthermore, knockdown of the spp mrna level in mammalian cells restored the inhibitory effect of ecpsp on cell proliferation
 <cit> .

moreover, in  <dig> we reported ecpsp-1- <dig> enhances the expression of tumor growth factor-alpha  and epidermal growth factor receptor  at both the mrna and protein levels in a <dig> and hl- <dig> cell lines
 <cit> . therefore, ecpsp may possess dual functions involving both protein secretion and the regulation of gene expression. in this study, we use a systems biology approach to further characterize the biological function of ecpsp. in particular, we used dna microarray analysis to investigate the ecpsp-triggered gene expression and to characterize the genome-wide interactome of ecpsp. by combining these two datasets, we explored the integrated network from string  <dig>  and kegg to identify potential pathways and functional clusters to profile ecpsp-induced gene expression. finally, we used a cell migration assay to demonstrate the novel functions of ecpsp that were discovered using the systems biology approaches.

RESULTS
inflammatory molecules upregulated by ecpsp are central in the functional linkage network
to understand the gene expression profile triggered by ecpsp, we used dna microarray technology to analyze the transcriptome. all microarray analyses were conducted by phalanx biotech . each total rna, derived from the cells transfected with control plasmids or plasmids containing ecpsp, was duplicated on the array. we performed two technical replicates of all experiments to confirm the data and account for experimental variations. according to the gene expression data,  <dig> genes were upregulated by more than twofold with a statistics p value less than  <dig>  in ecpsp-expressing cells relative to controls . the  <dig> genes were submitted to the functional linkage network obtained from the string  <dig>  database, and a network was generated by choosing the default setting .

within this sub-network, a clearly evident area of dense interconnections contains nodes that are related to inflammatory responses. these include chemokines, interferon-induced/related molecules, and inflammatory receptors, such as toll-like receptors. the focused area thus reveals that ecpsp may induce the expression of genes that encode proinflammatory molecules for triggering inflammatory pathways. this discovery is crucial to understanding the biological function of ecpsp. the function of ecpsp as a conventional signal peptide for the secretion of mature ecp is well documented
 <cit> . we used differential display technique and real-time rt-pcr to demonstrate that ecpsp induces tgf-α and egfr overexpression
 <cit> . another study indicated that ecpsp is cytotoxic to bacteria and yeast, but not to mammalian cells
 <cit> . these findings demonstrated that ecpsp regulates gene expression in addition to executing its conventional function, protein secretion.

patients with asthma usually experience severe inflammation in the respiratory tract. the activated eosinophils that gather in the airways release mature ecp, which in turn damages bronchial epithelial cells. at the same time, it is possible that ecpsp might induce and release cytokines and chemokines to attract immune cells, such as t cells, nk cells, eosinophils and macrophages.

to explain the ontology of the functional network, network ontology analysis  which applied the categories of gene ontology to network analysis
 <cit>  would be employed. in the noa results, the category ‘biological process’ is related to inflammation that is involved in the immune response, including viral infection and biotic stimulation. the ‘cellular component’ is consistent with the extracellular release of cytokines, chemokines, and interferons. finally, the ‘molecular function’ is related to the production of chemokines and cytokines and activation of the jak/stat  signaling pathway, which is involved in interferon signaling and chemokine production 
 <cit> . to confirm the upregulation of molecules related to chemokine and jak/stat signaling, the mrna levels of ccl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  stat <dig>  and stat <dig> were measured by semi-quantitative rt-pcr. indeed, levels of mrnas encoding ccl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  stat <dig>  and stat <dig> were upregulated  <dig> -,  <dig> -,  <dig> -,  <dig> -,  <dig> -, and  <dig> -fold, respectively, in cells that expressed ecpsp-egfp as compared with cells that expressed egfp only . 

p
integrating insights into ecpsp-mediated gene induction with knowledge of tgf-α/egfr signaling
we previously demonstrated that ecpsp induced tgf-α and egfr expression at the mrna and protein levels in a <dig> cells
 <cit> . the growth factor tgf-α is one of the ligands that stimulates egfr phosphorylation and triggers the signaling pathways downstream of this event. since the analysis of the kegg database revealed that the stat pathway is triggered by tgf-α via egfr, resulting in cell proliferation, cell survival, migration and invasion, and the stats could be activated by chemokines and chemokine receptors and then drive the expression of cytokine-encoding genes, we hypothesized that stats may serve as key transcriptional regulators in the inflammatory response triggered by ecpsp. thus, incorporation of tgf-α, egfr, and the ecpsp-induced genes may enable the discovery of new regulatory networks initiated by ecpsp. to reduce the complexity of this analysis, the area of dense interconnections in figure
 <dig> was extracted and combined with tgf-α and egfr signaling pathway components.

the area of dense interconnections was determined manually, which was enlarged and extracted from a seed of ifnb <dig> to the borders of a proinflammatory molecule and a non-proinflammatory molecule. there are  <dig> nodes in the area of dense interconnections. after their incorporation, the resulting network showed that the tgf-α/egfr pathway connected with inflammatory molecules via stat <dig> and stat <dig>  important transcriptional factors that regulate cytokine expression and release 
 <cit> . therefore, ecpsp may initiate alternative inflammatory responses in cells when ecp is expressed simultaneously at asthma/inflammatiory condition. in addition, within these  <dig> nodes,  <dig>  were not related with inflammatory responses. however within the  <dig> nodes,  <dig>  were located within the tgf-α/egfr pathway network and these nodes functioned as cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis, corresponding to the proposed functions of this subnetwork. the other two nodes, tnfsf <dig> and ddx <dig>  were not proinflammatory molecule within the proinflammation network composed with  <dig> genes. thus we concluded that within the proinflammation network,  <dig> %  of nodes were inflammation-related ones. 
 <dig> and incorporated these with known features of tgf-α and egfr signaling.

since it is hypothesized that stat <dig> and stat <dig> might serve as key regulators between the subnetworks in beas-2b cells, we also investigated the mrna and protein levels of stat <dig> and stat <dig> in a <dig> cells in which the tgf-α and egfr are upregulated by ecpsp. if the stat <dig> and stat <dig> also upregulated by ecpsp, it is confident to merge the tgf-α/egfr signaling network and the proinflammatory network. as shown in additional file
1: figure s <dig>  the levels of mrnas of stat <dig> and stat <dig> were increased in the presence of ecpsp by  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold, respectively, as well as the protein level by  <dig> - and  <dig> - fold, respectively. these results indicated that stats might serve as real hubs to connect two subnetworks and regulate the gene expression induced by ecpsp.

stat <dig> and stat <dig> serve as hubs that connects tgf-α pathways and cytokine/chemokine production
to obtain a high-confidence network, we further studied the molecules that were induced by ecpsp by more than fourfold. the underlying functional linkage network is shown in figure
 <dig>  the functional linkage network was combined with the current knowledge of tgf-α, egfr, and stat1/ <dig> signaling. as shown in figure
 <dig>  stat <dig> and stat <dig> still serve as hubs that connect two functional clusters. one cluster contains interferon-inducing factors and chemokines, such as ifi44l, ifih <dig>  ccl <dig>  and cxcl <dig>  another cluster comprises molecules related to cell growth and proliferation, such as tgf-α and egfr. this network provides potentially valuable avenues for future research concerning the novel functions of ecpsp.

medium conditioned by ecpsp-expressing cells causes migration of raw  <dig>  cells
our observation that the expression of genes encoding the chemokines ccl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  and cxcl <dig> is induced by ecpsp suggests that cells expressing ecpsp may induce chemoattraction. among these four chemokines, some may be responsible for novel biological functions of ecpsp. several reports show that cxcl10
 <cit> , cxcl11
 <cit> , and cxcl <dig> can initiate the homing of th <dig> cells, nk cells, and eosinophils
 <cit>  and that ccl5/rantes attracts macrophages and eosinophils
 <cit> . we assayed macrophage migration using the human macrophage-like cell line raw  <dig>  to investigate whether the cytokines produced by ecpsp regulate the recruitment of immune cells. compared with medium conditioned by culturing ecpsp/beas-2b and egfp/beas-2b cells, the respective rates of chemoattractant-mediated macrophage migration were  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold higher, respectively, for medium conditioned by cells expressing ecpsp-egfp . given that ecpsp is expressed by activated eosinophils at sites of inflammation or infection, secretory chemokines might attract macrophages to eliminate damaged cells or pathogens. this is the first time that ecpsp has been proposed to function not only in secretion but also in assisting immune-cell migration. in order to demonstrate whether stat <dig> and stat <dig> serve as key transcriptional regulators or not experimentally, the individual sirna against stat <dig> or stat <dig> was transfected into beas-2b cells which express egfp or ecpsp-egfp. figure
 <dig> reveals that while the mrna and protein levels of stat <dig> and stat <dig> were knocked down, the migration of macrophages, which was induced by ecpsp, was downregulated by  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold, respectively. it indicated that the migration of macrophages enhanced by ecpsp was indeed regulated via stat <dig> and stat <dig>  it might reflect our hypothesis that the stat <dig> and stat <dig> serve as hubs to regulate the gene expression of chemokines and cytokines in the ecpsp/beas-2b cells. 

discussion
in this study, we generated the functional network using string combined with kegg. additionally, we also analyzed the  <dig> genes using the network dataset generated by cui and colleagues
 <cit> . cui’s dataset, including  <dig>  genes, is comprehensive for analyzing signaling pathways in cancers. however, only  <dig> genes overlap with our  <dig> genes. the signaling network could not be generated using these  <dig> genes. it may be due to our dataset is related with proinflammatory effects and cui’s dataset is focused on cancer signaling.

under asthmatic conditions, ecp would be released by activated eosinophils and damage bronchial epithelial cells. at the same time, ecpsp is cleaved by human sp and spp, and the resulting ecpsp triggers overexpression of tgf-α and egfr. it suggested that the short signal peptide of ecp might function not only in protein secretion but also to regulate gene expression
 <cit> . similarly, the signal peptide may provide other functions besides protein targeting. localization of the signal peptide of the envelope glycoprotein  of jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus to the nucleus regulates viral gene expression by mediating a beneficial post-translational step in the replication cycle
 <cit> . in addition, interaction of calmodulin with the signal peptide fragments of preprolactin and hiv- <dig> gp <dig> processed by spp triggers ca2+/calmodulin-dependent cellular signaling
 <cit> .

our study provides evidence that ecpsp does indeed regulate gene expression in cells and that the upregulated genes participate in inflammation-related processes. under inflammatory conditions, eosinophils might release cytokines to stimulate cell growth and activate immune cells; they might release chemokines to attract macrophages to the bronchia to eliminate the pathogens and damaged cell debris after secretion of ecp. the present microarray profiles show the upregulation of four chemokines, namely ccl <dig>  interferon-induced protein of  <dig> kda , interferon-inducible t-cell alpha chemoattractant , and cxcl <dig>  also called rantes, the chemotactic cytokine ccl <dig> is the most potent of these four chemokines, as it is able to both recruit eosinophils to tissues  and attract macrophages , th <dig> cells, and basophils to the site of inflammation
 <cit> . moreover, cxcl <dig> binds cxcr <dig> and enrolls th <dig> cells to resist intracellular pathogen infection, such as viruses
 <cit> . in addition, cxcl <dig> is an important contributor to airway hyperactivity
 <cit> . another ligand of cxcr <dig>  cxcl <dig>  attracts th <dig> cells, nk cells, and eosinophils to inflammatory sites
 <cit> . the cytokine cxcl <dig> interacts with cxcr <dig> on th <dig> and cd <dig> effector t cells and plays a crucial role in recruiting these cells to sites of inflammation
 <cit> . apart from the molecules mentioned above, we observed ifn-β and many interferon-related molecules in the dataset generated by dna microarray analysis. interferons have several functions in common, many of which involve anti-viral and anti-tumor activities. by interacting with their specific receptors, interferons can activate signaling pathways transmitted by stat proteins. the stats  are a family of transcriptional factors that regulate the expression of particular immunoregulatory genes. they can be activated by type i , type ii , and type iii  interferons
 <cit> . for example, type-i ifns can induce gene expression via either the isre  or gas  transcription elements through the actions of the stat1/stat <dig> heterodimer. in contrast, type ii ifns can transactivate a gene only if it contains the gas element by means of the stat <dig> homodimer
 <cit> .

in our dna microarray dataset, the ifnb <dig>  gene is upregulated 80%. it belongs to the type i ifns which can activate the jak/stat <dig> and stat <dig> pathways to regulate the expression of genes encoding chemokines that act downstream in this pathway. we thus suggested that ecpsp may regulate chemokine production by this pathway. transcriptomic analyses indicate that the upregulation of jak-stat <dig> signaling plays a crucial role in protecting against microbial infection
 <cit>  by enhancing the expression of genes encoding chemokines , a cytokine , and components of jak-stat <dig> signaling 
 <cit> . similarly, our investigation showed that genes including irf <dig>  ifn-induced protein with tetratricopeptides , myxovirus resistance  <dig> and  <dig> , and 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetases  are upregulated by ecpsp. in all of these instances, transactivation may depend on jak/stat signaling. therefore, we hypothesized that under inflammatory conditions, eosinophils release ecp to damage pathogens and that ecpsp simultaneously induces jak/stat signaling to protect host cells from microbial infection and trigger chemokine production that might recruit immune cells, such as macrophages, to inflammatory sites.

CONCLUSIONS
we report a potential new function for ecpsp, which involves the secretion of proinflammatory molecules to promote the migration of macrophages to sites of inflammation. this finding provides clues for researchers to study the roles of ecp and ecpsp under inflammatory conditions. we propose that ecpsp may serve as an effector to induce proinflammatory gene expression and to trigger the recruitment of immune cells, thus eliminating pathogens, removing damaged cells, and repairing bronchial epithelial cells via jak/stat signaling.
