BACKGROUND
natural antisense transcripts  are rna molecules harboring sequences complementary to other transcripts. expression of endogenous nats was first observed in viruses  <cit>  and prokaryotes  <cit> , followed by its detection also in eukaryotes  <cit> . the number of sense-antisense  transcripts slowly grew during the 1990's, as more examples were found in the study of the regulation of expression of individual genes. in some of these cases, a regulatory function for antisense rna in controlling the mrna or protein levels of the respective sense gene product was described . the availability of large scale cdna sequencing then led to the in silico discovery of significant numbers of sas transcript pairs in different species, including yeast, plants and mammals  <cit> . most recently, systematic genome-wide detection of transcription by strand-specific tiling oligonucleotide arrays or sequencing  substantiated the notion that expression of antisense transcripts is a widespread phenomenon, accounting for up to  <dig> % of all transcripts  <cit> . to date, only few studies have analyzed quantitative changes in the expression of larger numbers of nats under different experimental conditions. the function of nats and the regulation of their expression in relation to the corrresponding sense transcripts are largely unknown  <cit> . one possible function of nats is decreasing sense transcript abundance, e.g. by rnai-mediated degradation  <cit> . in this case, the levels of sense and antisense transcript would be expected to be negatively correlated. the effects of nats are not necessarily mediated by rna-rna hybridization but can also be brought about by rna-protein interactions  <cit> .

oligonucleotide microarrays such as affymetrix genechips detect labeled crna in a strand-specific manner. standard labeling methods based on incorporation of a t <dig> binding site with an oligo-dt primer during first strand cdna synthesis not only amplify selectively polya mrna, but also conserve strand-specificity of the resulting crna. this technology therefore in principle allows the measurement of transcripts in an orientation-specific manner. tiling arrays have indeed been used for a detailed experimental investigation of transcriptional activity on human chromosomes  <cit> . these studies have greatly advanced our understanding of the extent of genome-wide transcriptional activity and the abundance of nats and other non-coding rna transcripts. however, the requirement of multiple arrays to perform a genome-wide tiling array analysis of a single rna sample makes larger experiments prohibitively expensive, and therefore has to date precluded a comprehensive investigation of nats expression and regulation in many different experimental conditions. in contrast, expression analysis genechips such as moe <dig> for murine and u <dig> for human rna detect and measure a comprehensive set of the majority of protein coding mrnas on one single microarray, making global mrna expression profiling experiments relatively affordable. their extensive use in functional genomics studies has resulted in a wealth of data sets deposited in public data repositories. in this paper, we point to the presence of a considerable number of probe sets detecting nats on affymetrix genechip expression analysis arrays. probe sets potentially detecting nat were validated in silico, and microarray results showing expression of nats were confirmed by strand-specific rt-pcr. the large number of affymetrix datasets in public domain repositories like gene expression omnibus  can therefore be mined for the expression and regulation of hundreds of nats.

RESULTS
affymetrix genechip probe sets with "negative strand matching probes": in silico validation
the annotation tables of affymetrix genechips contain an entry termed "negative strand matching probes"  <cit> , suggesting that the respective probe sets may detect not the expression of the sense transcript indicated by the gene symbol for the probe set but instead a nat. of the  <dig> k probe sets on the murine genechip moe <dig>  <dig>   <dig> carry this annotation for all  <dig> probes of the probe set, while the same applies to  <dig> probe sets on the human hg u <dig> plus  <dig> . to determine whether this annotation could indeed be used to filter for probe sets detecting nat expression, we developed an automatic classification algorithm based on the probe set mapping to the ensembl v <dig> genome release  <cit> . probe sets that did not map to a transcript at all or showed cross-hybridisation to multiple loci constituted  <dig>  % of the total  <dig> potential nat-detecting probe sets . a further  <dig>  % were classified as "sense" transcript-detecting probe sets, in agreement with the gene symbol annotation provided by netaffx. however,  <dig>  %  were classified as "antisense" because they showed indeed a reverse complementary orientation to the sense transcript, confirming the netaffx annotation of "negative strand matching probes", and therefore will measure expression of a nat for the mrna indicated by the gene symbol. in addition,  <dig> other probe sets  detect a protein-coding transcript that overlaps with an mrna from the opposite dna strand. in these cases , the probe set measures the expression of an mrna that can function also as nat for the sas partner transcript. additional file  <dig> provides the list of probe sets classified as "antisense" or "overlap", annotated with the gene symbol and the gene title.

for comparison, we manually validated the orientation of a subset of  <dig> potential nat-detecting probe sets by performing a blast search using the probe set target sequence as query in ensembl. comparing the results of the automatic and manual classification approaches, we found a high concordance in the category "antisense" where 58/ <dig> were called by the automatic versus 63/ <dig> by the manual method . in the category "overlap", automatic classification gave more hits than manual inspection . together, the manual and automatic classification called  <dig> probe sets on the moe <dig>  <dig>  genechip as nat-detecting probe sets, which are listed in additional file  <dig> annotated with the gene symbol and the result of manual and automated validation. this annotation may be used to mine existing microarray data sets for expression and regulation of hundreds of nats. based on a rate of  <dig>  % of confirmed nat-detecting transcripts for moe <dig>  <dig>  , the human u <dig> plus  <dig>  genechip that has  <dig> probe sets with a netaffx annotation of "negative strand matching probes" can be expected to contain in the range of  <dig> nat-detecting probe sets.

while these large numbers of nat-detecting probe sets should facilitate the quantitative study of expression and regulation of antisense transcripts, it has to be pointed out that only a fraction of all nats can be detected by mining moe <dig> or u <dig> expression analysis data sets: because of the design of moe <dig> microarrays, nat-detecting probe sets are restricted to the 3' region of mrnas and will usually not detect intronic non-coding rnas. since the labeling protocol used in most moe <dig> data sets deposited in public databases is specific for poly-adenylated transcripts, all polya- nats are also not detected by the nat-detecting probe sets confirmed in our study.

confirmation of moe <dig>  <dig> -detected antisense transcripts by strand-specific rt-pcr
of the manually identified  <dig> probe sets detecting nats on the moe <dig>  <dig>  genechip, a significant fraction appears to be expressed based on present calls on at least  <dig> out of  <dig> arrays of  <dig> and  <dig> percent for "antisense" and "overlap" probe sets in a dataset obtained from macrophages stimulated in vitro . we next tested if the expression of nats as indicated by these probe sets from the moe <dig>  <dig>  genechip could be confirmed using strand-specific rt-pcr as an independent method.

to this end, we selected ten antisense-detecting probe sets from each of the categories "antisense" and "overlap", for which an additional probe set is present on the moe <dig>  <dig>  genechip that detects the corresponding sense transcript and chose primers from the probe set sequences . probe set- and strand-specific first strand cdna synthesis was set up using the pcr primers in separate reactions, with the 5' primer generating cdna of sense transcripts and the 3' primer of antisense transcripts for the category "antisense", whereas the orientation is reversed for probe sets in the "overlap" category . using an rna pool from different mouse tissues, for all ten probe sets from the "antisense" category and 8/ <dig> form the "overlap" category, antisense transcripts were detected as indicated by the amplification of a pcr fragment of the expected size  . relative levels of sense and antisense transcripts differed between the probe sets. for comparison, strand-specific rt-pcr for lyzs, b2m and cox6a <dig>  three genes not described to show antisense transcription, was included. while as expected no antisense expression was detectable for cox6a <dig>  both lyzs and b2m pcr showed a band indicating antisense expression. in comparison, the signal for the lyzs and b2m sense transcripts was much stronger , and the fact that the sense rna-detecting pcr became positive  <dig> cycles earlier than the antisense-detecting pcr in a sybrgreen real-time pcr analysis  confirmed a much more abundant expression. however, the fact that with strand-specific rt-pcr bands suggesting antisense rna for lysz and b2m were detected may indicate that using this method absolute strand-specificity cannot be achieved. therefore, in case of strong expression of the sense rna, detection of antisense transcripts by strand-specific rt-pcr at low levels may become unreliable. in future work, the use of adapter-tagged primers for rt may prove helpful in circumventing this problem  <cit> . on the other hand, it should be stressed that this effect cannot account for antisense signals that are within a similar range as the corresponding sense transcripts. hence, the probe sets we identified as antisense-detecting by manual validation in silico and confirmed as expressed by rt-pcr indeed measure the expression of antisense transcripts.

comparison of expression levels of sense-antisense pairs in mouse organs by rt-pcr
the results described above obtained using pooled rna indicated a generally lower expression level of antisense transcripts compared to sense mrnas. to investigate whether absolute and relative expression levels of antisense transcripts differ between tissues, we analyzed by real-time qpcr the expression of five sas pairs  after strand-specific cdna synthesis in murine spleen, liver, lung and thymus . overall, while expression of antisense transcripts was lower than that of the corresponding sense transcripts, differences in expression levels between tissues appeared to follow the same pattern for sense and antisense transcripts. there were some exceptions to this rule, however, e.g. the high level of dedd antisense transcript in liver and kidney, and the strong expression of vrk <dig> antisense mrna in the liver .

correlation of sas expression in multiple affymetrix data sets
the presence of a large number of probe sets on the moe <dig>  <dig>  genechip that detect antisense transcripts for an mrna that is probed by a complementary probe set  makes it possible to analyze the regulation of sas transcript pairs by using the large number of affymetrix microarray data sets deposited in public databases such as gene expression omnibus  or arrayexpress. we decided to utilize this wealth of publicly available data to address the question whether sas transcript pairs are always concordantly regulated, as suggested by the results of our qrt-pcr data . we downloaded expression data from a total of  <dig> moe <dig>  <dig>  genechips  from geo, scaled the arrays for a median expression of  <dig> and calculated pearson's correlation coefficients for  <dig> sas and  <dig> randomly chosen control probe set pairs. fig. 4a shows an example of a sas probe set pair depicted in the ensembl browser. examples of sas pairs showing no correlation as well as a high degree of correlation are shown in fig. 4b. the distribution of correlation coefficients for all sas pairs in comparison to the control probe set pairs is depicted in fig. 4c. when correlation was analysed using the pooled data from all experiments , the correlation coefficients for the control probe set pairs are distributed roughly symmetrically around  <dig>  however, the distribution is shifted to the right for the sas pairs . in fact,  <dig> of  <dig> sas probe set pairs were correlated positively with a coefficient of correlation >  <dig> , while none of the control pairs passed this threshold. strikingly, there was not a single sas pair with a coefficient of correlation < - <dig> , suggesting that negative correlation of expression between sas pairs is a rare event . pooling the data from all  <dig> datasets may obscure positive or inverse correlations between sas transcripts under specific biological conditions. we have therefore also calculated the correlations between sas and random probe set pairs separately for the individual datasets . the distribution of the correlation coefficients from this analysis is wider, but again centered around  <dig>  importantly, sas pairs showed more positive correlation of expression than random probe set combinations but no evidence of inverse correlation. these data therefore strengthen the concept that the expression of antisense transcripts tends to be positively linked to expression of the sense partner, and do not support a model where antisense transcripts function primarily to down-regulate levels of the sense transcript by transcriptional interference or rnai-based degradation. similar conclusions were drawn in the study of katayama et al., that found an overall correlation between sas pair expression. on the other hand, the positive correlation of sas pair expression shown here does not necessarily mean that antisense rna does not down-regulate sense mrna levels. such a function will have to be tested in individual cases by knocking down the antisense transcript and measuring the effect on sense mrna levels.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, we have shown here that affymetrix moe <dig> microarray data sets contain a considerable amount of quantitative information about the expression levels of hundreds of nats. this information can be uncovered using the netaffx annotation "negative strand matching probes" followed by manual or automated in silico validation in ensembl, as we have done here for the moe <dig>  <dig>  genechip, yielding the more than  <dig> nat-detecting probe sets provided in additional file  <dig>  experimental confirmation by strand-specific rt-pcr showed that most of the nats indicated by microarray results were indeed expressed, interestingly at different levels between tissues.

very recently, werner et al. reported a similar approach to measure nats by using the first version of the affymetrix u <dig> mouse expression analysis genechips, that contained a large number of probe sets in reverse complementary orientation  <cit> . they found a similar present call rate as reported by us for nat-detecting probe sets on moe <dig> arrays and also could confirm the expression of many sas pairs by rt-pcr. while moe <dig> and u <dig> genechips harbor a much lower percentage of "negative strand matching probes" probe sets than the u <dig> mouse set, the large and rapidly expanding number of publicly accessible datasets provides the unprecedented opportunity to extract hidden information about sas transcript pairs expression as a by-product of gene expression profiling experiments.
