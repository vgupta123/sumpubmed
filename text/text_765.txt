BACKGROUND
as the largest family of membrane proteins in the human genome, the g protein coupled receptors  are structurally characterized by the presence of seven membrane-spanning α-helical segments with an extracellular n terminus and an intracellular c terminus. upon binding to agonists, a series of conformational changes propagate along transmembrane helices and reach the intracellular part of the receptor, which directly interacts with the hetero-trimeric g-protein. consequently, g protein’s activation triggers different cascades of events depending on the type of agonists bound to the receptor. therefore, as the initiation point to the flow of signals into cells, gpcrs are associated with a plenty of diseases that make members of this family significant pharmacological targets.

the first solved x-ray crystal structure of gpcr belongs to bovine rhodopsin  <cit> , which is followed by the crystal structure of human β2-adrenergic receptor  in the inactive state  <cit> . since  <dig>  the cholesterol bound form of β2ar   <cit> , the structure of turkey β1-adrenergic receptor   <cit> , the structure of a methylated β2ar   <cit>  and various forms of inactive states of β2ar bound to antagonists such as ici  <dig>  and alprenolol   <cit>  have been reported. finally, the nanobody-stabilized active state of β2ar in complex with g-protein, has been solved by rasmussen and his coworkers   <cit> . still, these static pictures of the receptor remain insufficient to describe the dynamic character of the receptor, which governs the function. it is a well-established concept that proteins have an intrinsic ability to sample an ensemble of distinct conformations in order to perform certain functions  <cit> . the ligand simply selects the optimal receptor conformation for binding followed by an induced fit to stabilize the final conformation. many questions remain on these multiple, ligand-specific conformational states of β2ar with different levels of activity from fully active to fully inactive, which induce distinct signaling pathways.

the ternary complex model proposed in  <dig> by lefkowitz and his coworkers  <cit>  describes an allosteric mechanism for receptor activation. the agonist molecule, when bound to the extracellular part, simply promotes and stabilizes the high affinity β2ar-g protein complex. following the laws of thermodynamics, binding of g-protein increases the receptor’s affinity for agonist binding to the same extent. fluorescence spectroscopic studies of β2ar by ghanouni et al. <cit>  presented a model with multiple, agonist-specific receptor states, in which the activation occurs through a sequence of conformational changes. they also suggested that the activation barrier for transition from intermediate to active state is high, and that in vivo the barrier is more likely reduced by g protein binding. the presence of an intermediate state is further supported by the fluorescence spectroscopy studies of swaminath et al. <cit> , suggesting a mechanistic model for gpcr activation, where agonist binding stabilizes a series of conformational states with distinct cellular functions.

in addition to experiments, several md simulation studies have been conducted after the inactive and active states of the receptor have been solved by x-ray crystallography. one simulation study by dror et al. <cit>  reveals that the receptor exists between two distinct inactive conformations of the receptor, one with the ionic lock intact and one with the lock broken. in  <dig>  dror and his coworkers proposed a completely different activation mechanism in which the structural changes start at the g protein binding site propagating upwards as opposed to agonist-induced conformational changes that start at the agonist binding site and propagate down to g protein binding site  <cit> . the agonist-bound crystal structure of β2ar without a binding partner  recently revealed by rosenbaum et al. <cit>  is found to be identical to the inactive state of the receptor . this suggests that in the absence of a g-protein, the receptor prefers to adopt the inactive conformation whether or not it is bound to an agonist. in other words, the agonist molecule is not sufficient alone to shift the equilibrium to the active state. dror et al. <cit>  also proposed an intermediate state for g-protein binding site, which exists as a part of the receptor’s intrinsic dynamics. binding of a g-protein to this binding site simply promotes a transition to the active conformation, which is further stabilized by an agonist bound at the extracellular region. the most important feature about the dynamics of β2ar is the strong coupling that exists between the intracellular g-protein binding site and the extracellular ligand-binding site of the receptor  <cit> . the receptor behaves like a pair of pincers where the intracellular part becomes narrower as the extracellular part becomes wider, and vice versa.

due to its unstructured nature, icl <dig> region is either unresolved in crystallographic experiments or completely removed and replaced by t4-lysozyme  to facilitate the crystallization. thus, none of the experimental and simulation studies have discussed the possible effect of icl <dig> on the intrinsic dynamics of the receptor. its replacement by t4l to facilitate crystallization did not prevent agonist-induced conformational changes based on fluorescence spectroscopy measurements  <cit> . yet, it is well accepted that its direct interaction with g-protein probably have a significant role on the receptor’s dynamics and the activation/inactivation pathway  <cit> .

in this study, the effect of icl <dig> on receptor’s conformational dynamics was investigated via two distinct models of the receptor. both models were generated from the inactive state of the receptor  after removal of t4l. moreover, the partial inverse-agonist carazolol was removed from the binding site of both models, since the goal of this work was to provide data about the intrinsic dynamics of the receptor, i.e., the ensemble of conformations accessible to its apo form. according to the current view on ligand binding, the equilibrium distribution of conformational states may be shifted upon ligand binding.

in the so-called loop model, the icl <dig> region was modeled as an unstructured loop of 32-residues length and inserted between two open ends of tm <dig> and tm <dig> , whereas in the second model, these two open ends were “clipped” or simply covalently attached to each other. the “clipped” model of the receptor, serving as a reference in our study, has been commonly used in recent simulation studies as well  <cit> . both models were subjected to  <dig> μs md simulation in a popc membrane bilayer at 310 k. the essential dynamics analysis was carried out to reveal important allosteric coupling within the receptor in the presence of icl <dig>  two distinct snapshots taken from the loop model’s trajectory were further used as docking targets for an agonist and an antagonist molecule in order to investigate the effect of icl <dig> on binding site conformations. finally, elastic network analysis was performed on different conformations and loop models to reveal a consistent picture on receptor intrinsic dynamics.

RESULTS
presence of icl <dig> affects rmsds and loop mobility
the difference between loop and clipped model dynamics is illustrated in the root mean square deviation  profiles throughout the simulation. in figure 1a, three different rmsd values are plotted for the loop model after fitting all snapshots to the initial snapshot based on coordinates of either the whole protein , the core region excluding icl <dig>  or the transmembrane region composed of helices . the large rmsds observed in loop model  are due to the presence of icl <dig>  the core region of the loop model is equivalent to the clipped model and thus, the comparison between their rmsd profiles  reveals that the clipped model has reached a plateau at an earlier time  than the loop model . the time at which the loop model’s core region reaches the plateau corresponds to the time when icl <dig> stabilizes as well. the stabilization of icl <dig> corresponds to a significant change in its conformation, observed as close packing underneath the receptor, which will be discussed later in the text.

on the other hand, the rmsd values of the transmembrane region  reach a plateau at around 50 ns in both models. this indicates that the structure of transmembrane region is preserved comparably in both models. furthermore, the presence of icl <dig> affects the mobility of small intra- and extracellular loops  in the loop model, which are present in the core profile but not the tmemb. there is a strong correlation between the rmsd profiles of the whole protein and icl <dig> , given by the uppermost red and green lines in panels a and b, respectively. the rmsd value of icl <dig> is obtained after alignment of the core region to the initial structure . thus, the extremely high rmsd of whole receptor with icl <dig> is a consequence the high mobility of the long intracellular loop.

the root mean square fluctuation profiles  are plotted using the time range as  for both models . the rmsf of each alpha-carbon atom in the protein is calculated based on the average structure of the aligned snapshots. the first 50 ns are excluded as the equilibration stage of the transmembrane region in both models . the extent of the average fluctuation during 950 ns is found to be higher in the loop model  than that of the clipped model , in almost all protein regions, except the ecl <dig> region. another time range for the loop model was taken as  , where the whole protein has reached a plateau .

the most significant difference between two time ranges for the loop model is in the mobility of the icl <dig> region, which fell down to 2–3 Å in the second time range from 16 Å . in addition, a relatively lower decrease in rmsf is observed in all parts of the protein including the loops and the more stable helices in the second time range. however, such a difference cannot be observed in the mobility of the clipped model based on the two time frames . these results indicate that the fluctuation of icl <dig> region in the loop model is directly reflected on every part of the protein structure, including the transmembrane regions. once icl <dig> becomes closely packed under the receptor at around 700 ns , the mobility of the transmembrane region decreases slightly and becomes more similar to that of the clipped model.

another important observation about the rmsf profiles in figure  <dig> is the mobility of the ecl <dig> loop region, which is at the extracellular side of the membrane and plays an important role as an access point to the binding site. for the loop model, during the last most stable 300 ns, the rmsf of ecl <dig> decreases to 5 Å from  <dig>  Å, as a consequence of the decrease in the mobility of icl <dig>  but still, the mobility of ecl <dig> in the loop model is higher than that in the clipped model irrespective of the time ranges considered. the higher ecl <dig> mobility allows a wider range of conformational sampling, which would include the open/closed forms of the gateway to the binding site, making the loop model’s binding site more accessible and accommodating for diffusing ligands than the clipped model.

the conformational change of icl <dig> gives rise to a “very inactive” state of the receptor
figure 4a shows the rmsd profiles of the sixth transmembrane helix  from its inactive  and its active states  in reported crystal structures. the rmsd is calculated for the intracellular part of the helix composed of residues 267– <dig>  in the loop model , the deviation from both inactive and active states starts to increase at around 600 ns and levels off around 800 ns, amounting to a change of 2 Å. on the other hand, no significant change is observed in the clipped model . the deviation is illustrated in figure 4b, where the first snapshot of tm <dig>  is close to the inactive state  and the last snapshot of tm <dig>  is found to be away from both the inactive and the wide-open active state . the second view of the receptor from the intracellular side in figure 4b shows that icl <dig> becomes more wrapped up under the core of the receptor , which will be named as a “very inactive” state inaccessible to g-protein binding.

this close packing of icl <dig> is quantitatively represented in figure 4c, which shows the sudden change in the x-offset with respect to the y-offset. the value of x-offset is the difference in the x coordinates between the center of masses for the core of the receptor and the icl <dig> region. similarly, the value of y-offset is calculated from the difference in y coordinates of these center of masses. three distinct clusters are observed in time ranges of  ns,  ns and  ns. the first  and third clusters  correspond to the open and packed states of icl <dig>  respectively. the second one  represents a transition between the two states. interestingly, the second cluster’s starting time at 470 ns corresponds approximately to the time at which small helical formations appear inside icl <dig> . it is an open question whether these helical formations might trigger the transition to the packed state. additionally, the onset of the third cluster around 670 ns corresponds to the time, at which tm <dig> starts to deviate from the reference crystal structures .

the changes observed at the intracellular part of the receptor seem to affect the extracellular part, specifically the binding site of the receptor. figure 5a illustrates the profile of the distance between the pair of residues, ser207-og on tm <dig> and asp113-cg on tm <dig>  recent simulation studies by katritch et al. <cit>  have revealed that tilting of tm <dig> towards the receptor axis enables an optimum interaction between agonists and the two anchor sites, asp113/asn <dig> and ser203/ser204/ser <dig> side chains. based on experimental studies  <cit> , the distance between the side chain oxygen of ser <dig> and gamma carbon of asp <dig> should be within a range of 8 Å  and 10 Å  in order to accommodate the agonists at the binding site. however, the distance profile in figure 5a is most often out of this critical range and even beyond the distance values of the inactive state, which is around 11 Å. at around 600 ns, when the sudden conformational changes in both tm <dig> and icl <dig> occur, this distance starts to increase from 13 Å to 16 Å in loop model . on the other hand, there is no significant change in the distance profile of the clipped model  after 600 ns as expected.

the variation in the distance between ser <dig> and asp <dig> is illustrated in figure 5b , which shows two conformations of the receptor, with minimum and maximum distance values of  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å . clearly, the intracellular part of tm <dig> is slightly moving into the core region , while its extracellular part is moving away from the core region of the receptor. as a result, ser <dig>  which is located at the extracellular part of tm <dig>  drifts away from asp <dig> on tm <dig>  position of which does not change notably. similar motions are observed for tm <dig> and tm <dig> as well. as a result, the enlarged binding site becomes unfavorable for agonist binding due to lack of some key interactions.

figure 5c illustrates the correlation between the tm <dig> shift at the intracellular part of the receptor and the ser207-asp <dig> distance at the extracellular part of the receptor. in the loop model, the change in the rmsd value of tm <dig> with respect to the active state happens at around the same time as the increase in the ser207-asp <dig> distance, whereas in the clipped model, no such correlation is observed . three different states of the structure are observed in the loop model at around ,  and  ns intervals. in contrast, the conformational variations of the clipped model remain in a restricted area, which corresponds to the first conformational state  of the loop model.

in addition to the  <dig> μs md simulation, three independent 100 ns md simulations with different initial conformations and velocities were performed as explained in methods. due to restrained conditions during the preparation stage prior to md runs, the ser203-asp <dig> distance value was extended to ~16 Å from the initial value of ~11-12 Å. ser <dig> is another key residue for binding that lies on the next turn above ser <dig> on tm <dig>  the change in the distance between ser <dig> and asp <dig> is mainly the result of a change in the position of ser <dig> . within the first 20 ns of all four md simulations , the distance rapidly decreases back to its initial value of ~11-12 Å as shown in figure  <dig>  the explanation for such a decrease is that all four simulations started with an expanded extracellular  part and an intracellular part with icl <dig> set aside. however, the receptor is found to be in equilibrium when its extracellular part is open  and its intracellular part is closed  with icl <dig> closely packed underneath or vice versa. this is the direct consequence of the strong allosteric coupling that exists between extracellular and intracellular regions of the receptor and this seems to be consistent with the ternary complex model suggested by de lean et al. <cit> .

the loop model shows a conformational variation in its second intracellular loop , which is correlated with the motion of icl <dig>  additional file 2: figure s <dig> shows four different stages of conformational variation of icl <dig> changes with respect to intracellular part of tm <dig>  both rmsd values are calculated with reference to the active state . however, no such major structural change is observed in the clipped model. the motion of icl <dig> in the loop model is also illustrated, in which the icl <dig> between tm <dig> and tm <dig> steps aside as the icl <dig> comes closer to the middle region : cyan, final stage: red, and active crystal: green). no such conformational rearrangement in icl <dig> is observed in the clipped model. additional file 3: figure s <dig> illustrates the change in the rmsd value of ecl <dig> with the change in the ser207-asp <dig> distance. as the distance increases in the loop model, there is a conformational variation in ecl <dig> with respect to the active state. however, no such correlation is observed in the clipped model. clearly, the structural variation in ecl <dig> is directly affected by the change in the distance as a result of a shift of tm <dig> away from the binding site, which is in turn a consequence of the icl <dig> motion and tm <dig> shift at the intracellular part of the receptor.

ionic lock  is not a molecular switch
during  <dig> μs long md simulation of the loop and clipped models, which represent the inactive state of the receptor, the ionic lock profiles are monitored as shown in additional file 4: figure s <dig>  consistent with previous work  <cit> , the ionic lock seems to be on and off during the simulations of both models . thus, this ionic lock cannot distinguish between active and inactive states. the cause behind the breakage/formation of this ionic lock is found to be the result of a change in the rotational state of the Χ angle of glu <dig>  which coordinates perfectly well with the ionic distance profiles .

furthermore, the increase in the distance between two side chains that form the ionic lock, namely arg131-n and glu268-o, coincides properly with the increase in the distance between their alpha-carbons. in the profiles of the inactive state, the backbone distance fluctuates at around  <dig>  Å and reaches  <dig>  Å at most. however, in the known crystal structure of the active receptor , the distance between alpha-carbons is around 16 Å as a result of a significant outward shift in the intracellular part of tm <dig>  thus this backbone distance could be one possible measurement for detection of activation.

essential dynamics analysis reveals the transition to the “very inactive” state in the first principal mode
for both models, each frame in the trajectory was aligned onto the initial structure. then principal component analysis  based on only cα atom coordinates was performed to understand the effect of icl <dig> on the essential dynamics of the receptor  <cit> . the first principal mode explains about 69% and 22% of the protein’s overall motion in the loop and clipped models, respectively. figure 7a displays three different rmsd profiles for the intracellular part of tm <dig> in the loop model after alignment on the active state. these are computed for the original trajectory  and for the two reconstructed trajectories, one including only the first mode  and the other showing the cumulative effect of the first five modes . projection of the md trajectory onto the first principal eigenvector  shows an abrupt change, which is coupled with the transition to the “very inactive” conformation. the profile obtained from the projection of cumulative five modes, as expected, explains this transition better.

additionally, the distance profiles between ser <dig> and asp <dig> in the loop model was recalculated using cα atoms only as shown in figure 7b. a high correspondence between the original and the two reconstructed profiles is observed as in figure 7a. also, a plot of rmsd value versus the ser207-asp <dig> distance clearly shows that the essential modes  describe the distribution in the original trajectory . thus, the closure of the icl <dig> driven by the first mode  is strongly coupled with the opening of the binding site indicated by the ser207-asp <dig> distance. for the clipped model, same profiles are plotted in additional file 5: figure s <dig>  the profiles obtained from the projection of the first and cumulative five modes do not explain satisfactorily the dynamics of the extracellular and intracellular regions of the receptor.

elastic network modeling reveals coupling between global modes and icl <dig> conformational transition
md simulations were performed on a receptor model including a specific unstructured conformation of icl <dig> obtained from modeller. in order to show the independence of the observed phenomena from the initial md structure, anm was performed on four distinct conformations of the loop model. these were selected as the initial, average and final structures of the  <dig> μs-long loop trajectory, and a receptor model containing an alternative unstructured conformation of icl <dig>  also provided by modeller. the rmsd between the alternative loop model and the one used in our md simulations is ~ 20 Å for the icl <dig> residues after an alignment of transmembrane regions.

the correlation between pca and anm modes is routinely assessed by the average overlap value

  oave=1k∑i=1k∑j=1k21/ <dig> 

where pi and uj represent the ith and jth normalized eigenvectors from pca and anm, respectively. the squared inner dot products are generally summed over the first k = <dig> modes, which describe the collective subspaces of each method. the average overlap values are  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  between the first  <dig> modes of pca and anm performed with the initial, average and final structures of md run and the alternative loop model, respectively. these values are quite high , representing satisfactory overlap between anm and pca subspaces.

in figure  <dig>  the conformational changes of icl <dig> and tm <dig> are shown for specific anm modes that yield a high overlap value  with the first principal component of md run. the left and right panels on the figure indicate different views  for each mode. specifically, vector representations of deformations, shown from the intracellular part , indicate clearly the inward movement of icl <dig> and tm <dig> in the 1st mode of md , anm 2nd mode for the average structure  and anm 1st mode for the alternative loop model .

the overlap matrices calculated based on residue displacements of icl <dig> and tm <dig> region only  indicate several anm modes exhibiting high overlap with the first mode of md. thus, slow modes of anm clearly drive the significant conformational change of icl <dig> and tm <dig> towards the receptor core, independent of the icl <dig> conformation/model used. in summary, our anm analysis justifies that the icl <dig> dynamics observed in md run can be attributed to be a feature of intrinsic receptor dynamics in conformity with a recent study carried on catalytic loop motions for different enzymes  <cit> .

the clustering of md snapshots reveals more conformational variations in the loop model
the snapshots taken from the simulations of the loop and clipped models are clustered all together based on different regions of the receptor: transmembrane region, intracellular part of the receptor, icl <dig> and ecl <dig> loop regions using an rmsd cutoff of  <dig>  Å,  <dig>  Å,  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å, respectively. the region for the alignment is chosen as the transmembrane region in all four cases. in all cluster profiles shown in figure  <dig>  the simulation time is divided into five ranges. frames 1– <dig>  5001– <dig> and 10001– <dig> are taken from the μs-long loop run, μs-long clipped run and the three short runs for the loop model.

the clustering profile of the transmembrane region shows four distinct clusters for  <dig> μs simulation of the loop model as illustrated in figure 9a. two of those clusters dominate over the other two, since they contain 54% and 37% of the total snapshots, which are observed at around  ns and  ns, respectively. on the other hand, two distinct clusters are obtained for the clipped model, and only one of them dominates for 92% of the time. for each of the three short md simulations, there is only one single cluster that dominates during 100 ns. these results indicate that the transmembrane region of the loop model alternates between two distinct conformations, while the clipped model’s transmembrane region prefers to adopt only one. interestingly, the second conformation in the loop model observed between  <dig> and 1000 ns coincides with the time at which the icl <dig> changes its conformation and the receptor adopts a “very inactive” state with an expanded binding site. a highly similar clustering profile is obtained for the binding site region as shown in additional file 7: figure s <dig>  this is an expected outcome considering that the binding site is embedded in the transmembrane region.

figure 9b shows the cluster profile of the intracellular part of the receptor, which consists of residues interacting with the g-protein based on the active crystal structure   <cit> . clearly, the loop model’s intracellular part samples three distinct states while the clipped model’s intracellular part only samples one conformation. in the three short simulations, there is also one single conformation dominating the others. the structural flexibility of the intracellular part is critical in making contact with the g protein. for the loop model, three snapshots were selected from each cluster shown in figure 9b as representatives and illustrated in additional file 8: figure s <dig> with a bottom view to show the contact of the receptor with the helical segment of gamma subunit of g protein. in the active crystal structure  taken as a reference and placed on top of the figure, g protein’s helical segment nicely fits the binding cavity. at the initial stages of the simulation, the binding cavity is almost preserved. towards the end of the simulation, the motion of icl <dig> closes down the g-protein binding site almost completely, as shown in the last frame leaving no contact point for the g protein.

the clustering profile in figure 9c, shows two dominant clusters for the icl <dig> region in both model. the two distinct states in the loop model are sampled for about 29% and 58% of the time, while in the clipped model two major clusters are sampled for 39% and 59% of the time. each of the short simulations of the loop model still does not show structural variation during 100 ns, similar to other two cases above. these results indicate that icl <dig> has no significant effect on the conformational sampling of icl <dig> 

finally, the cluster profile in figure 9d shows four distinct clusters for ecl <dig> region of the loop model, with each consisting of a considerable amount of snapshots and sampled consecutively during the simulation. on the other hand, the clipped model’s one μs simulation as well as three short simulations of the loop model, impart no conformational variation to the ecl <dig> region. the ecl <dig> loop region is the second extracellular loop covering the top of the receptor and plays a critical role of providing a passage to the binding site region. therefore, the ability of ecl <dig> to sample various conformations, being a functionally important feature for the receptor, is clearly enhanced in the presence of icl <dig> 

docking results of epinephrine and ici to an open and a closed form of the binding site
two frames of the loop model are selected from the  <dig> μs trajectory to represent the two extreme cases of ser207-asp <dig> distance value . one of the conformers is a closed form with a distance value of  <dig>  Å, which is in the range of active states   <cit> , while the other conformer represents an open form with the maximum distance value of  <dig>  Å. the docked ligands are a natural agonist epinephrine, and ici, which is an antagonist with a known crystal conformation . the epinephrine is chosen due to its relatively small size, and ici is selected because it is a large antagonist with an experimentally determined conformation.

figure 10a illustrates the poses of epinephrine with highest scores docked to open and closed forms of the receptor . epinephrine is shown as sticks while the key residues are in ball-and-sticks representation. the epinephrine’s highest score conformation docked to closed form  has more favorable interactions with neighboring residues than the highest score conformation docked to open form  of the receptor . there exist a total of eight neighboring residues, which interact with epinephrine in closed form within a radius of  <dig>  Å, namely asp <dig>  val <dig>  ala <dig>  ser <dig>  ser <dig>  phe <dig>  phe <dig>  and asn <dig>  seven of them, excluding ala  <dig>  are known to be key interacting residues in agonist binding  <cit>    <cit> . on the other hand, the best pose of epinephrine in the open form is found slightly out of the binding site region making interactions with ten residues with a distance of less than  <dig>  Å , among which only three  are key residues . the other seven are not reported as being significant in agonist binding. considering the small size of epinephrine, the closed form is found to be more favorable than the open form.

the docking results of ici indicate a complimentary situation. due to its large size, the antagonist ici cannot fit into a narrow binding site in the closed form, but it can be favorably docked into a wider binding site, such as the open form. figure 10c shows the highest score conformations docked in the open  and closed  form of the receptor . the rmsd values of docked ici to open and closed forms with respect to its native state are determined as  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å, respectively. clearly, ici when bound into a wider binding site is able to interact with experimentally reported key residues for antagonist binding. ici interacts with eight residues within a radius of  <dig>  Å, asp <dig>  tyr <dig>  ser <dig>  ser <dig>  phe <dig>  trp <dig>  tyr <dig> and asn <dig>  of which five  are reported as key residues  <cit>  . furthermore, ici is correctly oriented in the binding pocket with the hydrophobic catechol ring interacting with ser <dig> and ser <dig>  and its polar end interacting with asp <dig>  however, in the closed form, ici is improperly positioned in the binding pocket, interacting within a radius of  <dig>  Å with thr <dig>  asp <dig>  val <dig>  phe <dig>  tyr <dig>  phe <dig>  asn <dig>  lys <dig> and tyr <dig> of which only two  are known key residues.

to sum up, the agonist is favorably bound to the closed form, which coincides with the icl3-open conformation during the first half of the simulation. the icl3-open conformation may correspond to an intermediate state that promotes g-protein binding, which seems to be stabilized by the presence of the agonist at the binding site. an md simulation, where the binding site would be constrained to the agonist bound geometry, would give more insight in this perspective. in the second half of the simulation, the open geometry of the binding site is observed to which the antagonist favorably docks. this “very inactive” state corresponds to the closely packed icl <dig> that completely blocks the g-protein binding site.

CONCLUSIONS
the crystal structure of β2ar has been resolved for the first time in  <dig>  and since then in silico studies have been conducted to unravel structure-dynamics-function relationship of this g-protein coupled receptor. however, the missing intracellular loop icl <dig>  which is known to interact with the g protein at the cytoplasmic side, has not been considered or elaborated so far in these studies. in this respect, our md study exposed the marked effect of icl <dig> on collective dynamics and justified the correlated motion between the intracellular g-protein binding site and the extracellular ligand-binding site of the receptor  <cit> . the receptor behaves like a pair of pincers where the intracellular part becomes narrower as the extracellular part becomes wider, and vice versa.

in accordance with this coupling behavior, our μs long md simulation of β2ar, which included the modeled intracellular loop icl <dig>  revealed a so-called “very inactive” state of the receptor, which has not been reported before. in the second half of the simulation, the icl <dig> moved toward the core of the receptor and completely blocked the g-protein binding site. consequently, the intracellular part of tm <dig>  adjacent to icl <dig>  also shifted toward the core of the receptor. this conformational change in tm <dig> is in the opposite direction with respect to experimentally observed deformation during activation  <cit> , which is observed as an expansion or outward movement towards the lipid membrane. this new inactive state of the receptor may provide insight into the design of novel therapeutic drugs.

another important observation is the correlated motion between the binding site and the g-protein binding site regions. at around the same time when the icl <dig> blocked the g-protein binding site, the extracellular binding site of the receptor expanded. the expansion was detected based on the distance profile between two anchor residues, ser <dig> and asp <dig>  critical for agonist binding. in line with these findings, our docking studies indicated favorable antagonist binding to the expanded binding site  and agonist binding to the closed binding site .

this coupled conformational change seems to be transmitted from the intracellular part to the extracellular part of the receptor via tm <dig> and tm <dig>  as sara linse stated in her review  <cit> , “a 7tm receptor is like a bundle of rods immersed in the membrane and if a ligand grips the bundle at one end, the bundle opens up like a bouquet of roses at the other end”. in our study, the intracellular end is gripped or held tight by icl <dig>  and consequently the extracellular part opened up. in other words, icl <dig> played the dominant role in inducing the change in the intracellular part, which induced in turn the extracellular part. this dominancy of icl <dig> is expected due to its high mobility, which is also a desirable quality for initiation of interactions with intracellular proteins  <cit> . thus, we suggest that when left without icl <dig>  the receptor would not be able to sample that inactive state at all.

this transition to the “very inactive” state took place within a time frame of about  <dig>  μs . in the last  <dig>  μs of the simulation, icl <dig>  which was observed to be the most mobile region of the receptor during the whole simulation, preserved its close state. principal component analysis of  <dig> μs long md trajectory showed that the first principal mode, which explains 69% of the overall motion governs the transition from the initial inactive state to the “very inactive” state.

at this point it may be argued that our simulation conditions, such as the absence of any ligand at the binding site and/or intracellular proteins that may interact with icl <dig>  depict a non-physiological environment. even though, the receptor function is clearly linked with its interacting partners, our aim was to elucidate the intrinsic conformational dynamics of the intact receptor. based on the widely accepted population shift mechanism  <cit> , we tried to uncover the pre-existing conformational states of the apo receptor, which may be shifted and/or modified by the presence of binding partner. in fact, our anm analysis using different conformers/models of icl <dig> strengthened our md results on receptor dynamics. either the first or second collective mode in anm was found to be coupled with the specific motion of icl <dig>  independent of the model used. in contrast, none of these conformational transitions, nor any allosteric coupling between intra- and extracellular parts, were observed in the clipped model simulation lacking icl <dig> region. thus, we stress that the presence of icl <dig> provides a more realistic constriction than those of clipped and non-clipped  models so far used in β2ar simulations.

future works will be focusing on the loop model, which will consist of constraining the binding site region to observe the reverse transition  from the “very inactive” state to the inactive/intermediate state and possibly the active state with an opening of the g-protein binding site.
