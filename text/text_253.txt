BACKGROUND
the genus listeria encompasses six species, which could be divided into three major phylogenetic clusters: l. monocytogenes-l. innocua, l. ivanovii-l. seeligeri-l. welshimeri, and l. grayi  <cit> . l. monocytogenes is a well-recognized intracellular pathogen of humans and animals, with clinical features including meningitis, meningoencephalitis, septicemia, abortion, perinatal infections and gastroenteritis  <cit> . three genetic lineages have been identified within l. monocytogenes strains, with lineage i including serovars 1/2b, 3b, 4b, 4d, 4e, 4ab and  <dig>  lineage ii covering serovars 1/2a, 3a, 1/2c and 3c, and lineage iii comprising sublineages iiia, iiib and iiic covering serovars 4a, 4c and atypical 4b  <cit> . of the  <dig> l. monocytogenes serovars, four  are responsible for over 98% of human listeriosis cases whereas other serovars  are seldom implicated in listeriosis  <cit> . l. innocua is of particular significance because it is most closely related to l. monocytogenes, and they usually co-exist in various environmental, food and clinical specimens  <cit> . although these two species resemble each other ecologically, biochemically and genetically, l. innocua has no pathogenic inclination  <cit> . therefore, the l. innocua-l. monocytogenes clade within the genus listeria can be used as a model system to examine the evolution of pathogenicity.

intriguingly, some l. monocytogenes strains tend to lose virulence factors that play critical roles in infection, which has been considered as a rare example of evolution towards reduced virulence of pathogens  <cit> . certain l. monocytogenes lineage iiia strains are presumed to have identifiable linkage between l. monocytogenes and l. innocua by possessing many genes common to l. monocytogenes , and sharing many gene deletions similar to l. innocua   <cit> . therefore, the population structure and biodiversity in l. innocua may, from the other side of the coin, provide clues for the evolutionary history in the l. monocytogenes-l. innocua clade. unfortunately, comprehensive knowledge on the phylogenetic structure of l. innocua is still lacking.

various strain typing methods have been developed and improved with a general shift from phenotype-based to genotype-based strategies  <cit> . given its accuracy, reproducibility and increased speed of dna sequencing, dna sequence-based multilocus sequence typing  has gained more popularity  <cit> , and provided an overview of the population structure of l. monocytogenes  <cit> . internalin profiling seems to be instrumental to subtype l. monocytogenes strains into different serovars  <cit> . moreover, internalin loci are also present in non-pathogenic species, including l. innocua, and seem to play broad roles not merely limited to attachment and invasion of host cells  <cit> .

in this study, we attempted to delineate a phylogenetic framework based on internalin profiling and mlst analysis of a collection of l. innocua isolates from various food sources, and further to investigate microevolution in the l. innocua-l. monocytogenes clade.

RESULTS
biochemical patterns of l. innocua and l. monocytogenes strains
all l. innocua and l. monocytogenes strains displayed similar utilization patterns for xylose , mannitol  and glucose , while hemolysis could distinguish these two species with l. monocytogenes showing β-hemolysis and all l. innocua strains being non-hemolytic. with regard to the rhamnose utilization pattern, three l. innocua strains  <dig>  l <dig> and l <dig>  as well as l. monocytogenes sublineages iiib and iiic strains covering serovars 4a, 4b and 4c were atypically negative for rhamnose fermentation .

internalin profiling indicates five internalin types  of l. innocua
upon examination of  <dig> l. monocytogenes-l. innocua common,  <dig> l. innocua-specific and  <dig> l. monocytogenes-specific internalin genes, l. innocua strains harbored  <dig> to  <dig> internalin genes, with three l. monocytogenes-l. innocua common and one l. innocua-specific internalin genes absent individually or in combination in certain l. innocua strains . eighteen l. monocytogenes-specific internalin genes were absent in all l. innocua strains except for l <dig> having inlj . these l. innocua strains could be separated into five internalin types , with it <dig> containing a whole set of l. monocytogenes-l. innocua common and l. innocua-specific internalin genes, it <dig> lacking lin <dig>  it <dig> lacking lin <dig> and lin <dig>  it <dig> lacking lin <dig>  lin <dig> and lin <dig>  and it <dig> lacking lin <dig> but bearing inlj. the majority of l. innocua strains fell into it <dig>  and it <dig> . among the remainders, three belonged to it <dig> , one to it <dig>  and one to it <dig> . in addition, all l. monocytogenes strains contained l. monocytogenes-l. innocua common internalin genes ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  and lacked all l. innocua-specific internalin genes .

l. innocua
mlst correlates with internalin profiling of l. innocus strains
sixty-four strains in the l. monocytogenes-l. innocua clade were classified into  <dig> unique sequence types  in the mlst scheme with a high discrimination index . the concatenated sequence data showed that l. innocua was genetically monophyletic as compared to l. monocytogenes, with  <dig> l. innocua and  <dig> l. monocytogenes strains bearing  <dig>  and  <dig>  polymorphisms respectively. the average nucleotide diversity π of l. innocua was lower than that of l. monocytogenes . however, the nonsynonymous/synonymous mutation rate of l. innocua was higher than that of l. monocytogenes  .

d.i.: discrimination index; ks: number of synonymous changes per synonymous site; ka: number of non-synonymous changes per non-synonymous site; π: nucleotide diversity.

with l. welshimeri as the outgroup species, the phylogenetic tree revealed nine major branches of the l. monocytogenes-l. innocua clade, four corresponding to the recognized l. monocytogenes lineages i, ii, iiia/c and iiib, one harboring the low-virulent l. monocytogenes lineage iiia strains reported in our previous study  <cit> , and the other four beloning to l. innocua . the majority of l. innocua strains were placed in two branches: one contained  <dig> strains  representing sts  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  9- <dig>  21- <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and the other harbored  <dig> strains  representing sts  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  18- <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 28- <dig>  remarkably, l. innocua strain l <dig>  showed the least genetic distance to the main cluster of l. monocytogenes. this strain seems to serve as the evolutionary intermediate between l. monocytogenes and l. innocua main clusters together with the low-virulent l. monocytogenes lineage iiia strain  <dig>  additionally, l. innocua strain  <dig>  was present on the halfway between the l. innocua main cluster and strain l <dig> .

based on the mlst scheme and internalin profiling, l. innocua could be divided into at least four subgroups. two main subgroups a and b located in the two major branches of the phylogenetic tree, which correlated with it <dig> and it <dig>  , and it <dig> and it <dig>  respectively. in addition, one it <dig> strain  <dig> and one it <dig> strain l <dig> present in two individual branches formed subgroups c and d respectively .

phylogeny and population history of l. innocua
as aforementioned, l. innocua was genetically monophyletic  as compared to l. monocytogenes . when sequence data were analyzed after stratification by subgroups, the number of polymorphisms and genetic diversity within each subpopulations were reduced , suggesting a barrier for genetic exchange between these l. innocua subgroups. such barrier was also observed between l. monocytogenes lineages , consistent with one previous report  <cit> .

tajima's d test revealed that l. innocua and l. monocytogenes did not evolve under neutrality. a marginal positive value of tajima's d observed for ribc in l. monocytogenes  became smaller or negative when analyses were performed for separate lineages, suggesting a divided population structure. similarly, significant or marginal positive tajima's d values were observed for gyrb  in l. monocytogenes lineage ii, and for sigb  and gap  in lineage iii, supporting that lineages ii and iii represented diverse populations as compared to lineage i . on the other hand, gyrb , betl  and gap  showed significant negative tajima's d values in l. innocua, indicative of a bottleneck or selective sweep  <cit> . also, tajima's d were marginal negative for betl in l. innocua subgroup a  and gap in subgroup b  .

#,  <dig>  < p <  <dig> ; *, p <  <dig> ; **, p <  <dig> ; ***, p <  <dig> .

a. no polymorphisms in the data, resulting in inability to compute tajima's test.

the exterior/interior branch length ratio test demonstrated that l. innocua and its subgroup a as well as l. monocytogenes and its lineage i showed a significantly smaller exterior/interior branch length ratio  than expected under the coalescent model . this suggests that the contemporary l. innocua population experienced a recent expansion of its population size, consistent with a population bottleneck. specifically, l. innocua subgroup a underwent expansion of the population size , while subgroup ii did not  .

the rate of recombination within bacterical species can differ widely from one species to another. in the l. innocua-l. monocytogenes clade, both the relative frequency of occurrence of recombination versus mutation  and the relative effect of recombination versus point mutation  were about two to three times higher in l. innocua than in l. monocytogenes . l. innocua subgroup a exhibited significantly higher frequency  and effect  of recombination than subgroup b , consistent with a definite population expansion of subgroup a as aforementioned. however, the higher recombination rate of l. innocua subgroup a did not seem to contribute to nucleotide diversity  . on the other hand, both the frequency and effect of recombination in l. monocytogenes lineage ii were higher than those in lineages i and iii .

nd, not done.

a. the ratio of probabilities that a given site is altered through recombination and mutation, representing a measure of how important the effect of recombination is in the diversification of the sample relative to mutation.

b. the ratio of rates at which recombination and mutation occur, representing a measure of how often recombination events happen relative to mutations.

the phylogram based on the analysis with correction for recombination revealed that the time to the most recent common ancestor  of l. innocua subgroups a and b was similar , suggesting that these two subgroups appeared at approximately the same time. in addition, our study also showed the tmrca of l. monocytogenes lineages i and ii were similar, consistent with a recent report  <cit> .

distribution of l. innocua isolates among different sources
of the  <dig> l. innocua food isolates,  <dig> were obtained from meat,  <dig> from milk and  <dig> from seafoods. the majority of meat isolates  belonged to subgroup a, while most seafood isolates  belonged to subgroup b. there were significant associations between subgroups and source of isolation .

l. innocua isolates lack virulence genes found in l. monocytogenes, and were nonpathogenic to mice
all l. innocua strains lacked  <dig> virulence genes examined, with the exception of the subgroup d strain  harboring inlj  and two subgroup b strains  bearing bsh . all of these l. innocua strains were nonpathogenic to icr mice .

discussion
the ecological, biochemical and genetical resemblance as well as the clear differences of virulence between l. monocytogenes and l. innocua make this bacterial clade attractive as models to examine the evolution of pathogenicity in listeria genus. l. monocytogenes causes life-threatening infections in animals and human populations, and exhibits a diversity of strains with different pathogenicity  <cit> . l. innocua has once been postulated as the nonpathogenic variant of l. monocytogenes, and holds the key to understanding the evolutionary history of the l. monocytogenes-l. innocua clade. however, information on the phylogenetic structure and microevolution of l. innocua is still lacking. thus, we characterized l. innocua strains in our laboratory stock from phylogentic perspectives.

profiling of  <dig> internalin genes grouped the l. innocua strains into five internalin types, it <dig> to it <dig>  with it <dig> and it <dig> as the major types . the mlst scheme identified two major phylogenetic branches containing the majority of sequence types , and other two bearing one strain each . consequently, l. innocua consists of at least four distinct subgroups a, b, c and d. subgroup a correlates with one of the major branches including all the it <dig> and it <dig> strains with the exception of one it <dig> strain  <dig> belonging to subgroup c, while subgroup b correlates with the other major branch covering all the it <dig> and it <dig> strains . therefore, it is inferred that a certain l. innocua subgroup possibly contains several serovars and exhibits different internalin patterns, which is similar to the fact that each lineage of l. monocytogenes contains several serovars and exhibits more than one internalin patterns, as exemplified by the internalin island between ascb and dape in our previous report  <cit> .

the majority of l. monocytogenes lineage i strains harbor inlc2de, and a small number of 1/2b strains carry inlgc2de instead. within l. monocytogenes lineage ii strains, the majority of 1/2a and 1/2c strains harbor inlgc2de and inlghe respectively. in addition, l. monocytogenes lineage iii strains show the greatest level of diversity  <cit> . the l. innocua subgroup a strains either contain a whole set of l. monocytogenes-l. innocua common and l. innocua-specific internalin genes, or lack lin <dig> and lin <dig>  and the l. innocua subgroup b strains either lack lin <dig> or lack lin <dig>  lin <dig> and lin <dig> instead. besides, the subgroup d strain l <dig>  which shows the least genetic distance to l. monocytogenes, lacks lin <dig> but bears l. monocytogenes-specific inlj in the counterpart region in l. monocytogenes genomes . we propose that certain internalin genes such as lin <dig>  lin <dig>  lin <dig> and lin <dig> could be potential genetic markers for subgroups of l. innocua.

the phylogenetic tree revealed nine major branches of the l. innocua-l. monocytogenes clade, five belonged to l. monocytogenes representing lineages i, ii, and iii, consistent with previous reports  <cit> , and the other four represented l. innocua subgroups a, b, c and d . overall, l. innocua is genetically monophyletic compared to l. monocytogenes, and the nucleotide diversity of the l. innocua species is similar to that of l. monocytogenes lineage i but less than those of l. monocytogenes lineages ii and iii. in evolutionary terms, younger bacterial species has lower level of genetic diversity  <cit> . the results from this study offer additional evidence that l. innocua possibly represents a relatively young species as compared to its closest related pathogenic species l. monocytogenes.

previous studies suggest that l. monocytogenes represents one of the bacterial species with the lowest rate of recombination  <cit> . in this study, strains in the l. innocua-l. monocytogenes clade exhibit similar value of ρ/θ to those of the bacillus anthracis-bacillus cereus clade  <cit>  and slightly higher than those of staphylococcus aureus  <cit> , but still considerably lower than those of pathogens such as clostridium perfringens  <cit> , neisseria meningitis  <cit>  and streptococcus pneumoniae  <cit> . both the relative frequency of occurrence of recombination versus mutation  and the relative effect of recombination versus point mutation  of l. innocua were higher than those of l. monocytogenes. more strikingly, recombination rates of l. innocua subgroup a were particularly high . wirth et al.  <cit>  proposed from the data for escherichia coli that epidemic and virulent bacteria face an increased selective pressure for rapid diversification in response to host immune defenses, resulting in higher recombination rates. l. monocytogenes is an opportunistic pathogen with wide host ranges as well as a saprotroph found in different environments  <cit> . though lineage i strains were responsible for almost all major human listeriosis outbreaks and the majority of sporadic cases  <cit> , those of lineage ii exhibited higher recombination rate according to our observation and the findings by bakker et al.  <cit> . bakker et al.  <cit>  proposed that higher recombination in lineage ii was not due to selective forces involved in its virulence. recombination may be critical for lineage ii to successfully compete and survive in a board range of different environments. lineage ii strains are more commonly found at higher levels than lineage i strains in natural environments including foods  <cit> . similarly, we postulate that the nonpathogenic species l. innocua descending from its pathogenic ancestor has better adaptability to contemporary environmental niches. removal of some gene loci related to virulence  in listeria could be regarded as adaptive gene loss, which favors its survival in environmental niches as a saprotroph  <cit> .

l. innocua subgroups a and b strains have similar tmrca and exhibit similar genetic distances to l. monocytogenes, suggesting that these two subgroups appeared at approximately the same time . however, subgroup a experienced a recent expansion of the population size, consistent with the higher recombination frequency  and effect  of subgroup a as compared to those of subgroup b. this further implies that these two subgroups have distinct inclinations and adaptive abilities to environments and occupy different habitats, while subgroup a might face increased selective pressures resulting in higher recombination rates. additional support for this indication is that the majority of subgroup a isolates  contain a whole set of l. monocytogenes-l. innocua common and l. innocua-specific internalin genes which may play broad roles in enhancing the adaption to various environments. hence, the l. innocua subgroup a strains might represent the possible evolutionary direction towards adaptation. interestingly, the higher recombination rate of l. innocua subgroup a did not seem to contribute to nucleotide diversity. one possible explanation is that members of subgroup a recombines only with other members of subgroup a, so that recombination does not introduce novel polymorphisms into subgroup a and therefore does not increase the genetic diversity.

previous reports indicate that horizontal gene transfer might have occurred earlier to form a more ancestral l. monocytogenes strain, which would then give rise to l. innocua through gene deletion events possibly via low-virulent l. monocytogenes lineage iiia strains  <cit> . in this study, l. innocua subgroup d strain l <dig> exhibits the least genetic distances to l. monocytogenes , and constituted another evolutionary intermediates between l. monocytogenes and l. innocua main clusters. therefore, l. innocua strain l <dig> and l monocytogenes strain  <dig>  <cit>  might serve as intermediate linkage strains in deciphering the evolution of the l. innocua-l. monocytogenes clade.

the strain l <dig> seems to share a "hybrid" genetic background derived from l. innocua and l. monocytogenes by the mlst data and its carriage of l. monocytogenes-specific virulence gene inlj. inlj is a sortase-anchored adhesin specifically expressed in vivo  <cit> , but its function in atypical l. innocua strains requires further investigation. another atypical l. innocua strain prl/nw 15b <dig> has been characterized as having the entire lipi- <dig> embedded into an otherwise typical l. innocua genetic background  <cit> . however, we did not see its presence in the strain l <dig>  prl/nw 15b <dig> falls into the main l. innocua cluster based on sequencing of 16s-23s intergenic regions, 16s rrna and iap genes, and has possibly acquired lipi- <dig> by a later transposition event, based on the finding of a  <dig> bp tn <dig> integration consensus sequence flanking the virulence island  <cit> . thus, unlike l <dig>  prl/nw 15b <dig> does not constitute an evolutional intermediate between l. monocytogenes and l. innocua. complementary transfer of only some of the virulence genes such as lipi- <dig> did not change the avirulent character of prl/nw 15b <dig>  <cit> . in this study, all l. innocua strains were nonpathogenic in mice models .

CONCLUSIONS
this study reveals that l. innocua is a relatively young species descending from l. monocytogenes. the evolutionary history in the l. monocytogenes-l. innocua clade represents a rare example of evolution towards reduced virulence of pathogens. l. innocua is genetically monophyletic and comprises four subgroups based on internalin profiling and mlst scheme. the majority of l. innocua strains belong to two major subgroups a and b, and one atypical subgroup might serve as a link between l. monocytogenes and l. innocua main cluster in the evolutionary chain. while subgroups a and b appeared at approximately the same time, the subgroup a strains seem to represent the possible evolutionary direction towards adaptation to enviroments. it is believed that the phylogenetic structure and evolutionary history of l. innocua will be much clearer if a larger strain collection and the whole genome sequences of more representative strains become available.
