BACKGROUND
basic auditory skills constitute a foundation for language development  <cit> . healthy infants possess well-developed auditory capabilities from birth, allowing the perception of a wide range of auditory material, as indexed by behavioral  <cit>  and electrophysiological methods of testing  <cit> . perceptual development, however, undergoes a process of narrowing and specialization for almost all socially relevant stimuli - voices, faces, and speech sounds . during the first months of their lives, infant's sensory systems are broadly tuned to any type of auditory material, and they are able to discriminate speech sounds regardless of whether these sounds belong to the surrounding adult language or not  <cit> . language-specific discrimination abilities improve between  <dig> and  <dig> months of age for native  <cit> , and decline for unfamiliar phoneme contrasts  <cit>  as the brain tunes itself towards optimal perception of the native spoken language  <cit> . several studies have suggested that improved native-phoneme discrimination skills are good predictors of later language performance  <cit> , while the opposite has been observed to hold for the non-native phoneme discrimination. atypically long lasting sensitivity to non-native speech contrasts may indicate poor brain commitment to a native language, and has been previously demonstrated to result in slower language development at the age of  <dig> years  <cit> .

most children develop language skills without effort, following a typical sequence of development. however, some children, including those born very prematurely, may have great difficulties in acquiring language  <cit> . of those prematurely born children who survive, roughly half have language and learning disabilities  <cit> , representing a growing public interventional and educational concern  <cit> . an atypical auditory processing has been demonstrated in prematurely born infants  <cit>  which has been linked to atypical language  <cit>  and cognitive development at school age  <cit> . however, there is currently no clear model which would provide information on stages of language, and auditory processing development in prematurely born infants through the first  <dig> years of life. event-related potentials  are a safe and reliable method to investigate language related auditory processing in infants long before their language production abilities can be assessed  <cit> .

the erp component called the mismatch negativity  is elicited by potentially discriminable changes in repeated auditory stimuli  <cit> , and its latency and amplitude are correlated to behavioural discrimination accuracy  <cit> . cheour et al.  <cit>  found that amongst six-month-old monolingual finnish infants, the non-native/õ/elicited higher mmn amplitudes than the native/ö/presumably due to the higher acoustic contrast compared to repeated native/e/. in contrast, at the age of one year, these infants showed a diminished mmn for the non-native/õ/but an increased mmn for the native/ö/, indicating long-term memory traces for native speech sounds formed between the ages of six months and one year  <cit> . these studies provide an electrophysiological evidence for neural tuning to familiar spoken material  <cit> , and suggest it to be predictive of later language development  <cit> .

the present study examined 1) the ability of prematurely born and full-term, healthy six-month-old infants to discriminate between native , and between native and non-native phonemes , as reflected by the mmn; and 2) the development of this ability during the subsequent period of six months; 3) language development at the ages of one and two years, and 3) an association of the development of neural discrimination ability with language abilities at two years of age.

we recorded the mmn from  <dig> very prematurely born monolingual infants , and  <dig> full-term, healthy infants at the age of six months , and at the age of one year  to investigate whether these two groups of children differ from each other in their ability to discriminate between phonemes. gestationally corrected age was used for the prematurely born infants.

language skills  of the full-term and prematurely born infants were assessed at the ages of one and two years using macarthur communicative development inventories .

RESULTS
at the age of  <dig> months, there was no significant difference between the two groups in the mmn amplitude in response to non-native phoneme contrast . consistent with the theory of perceptual narrowing and previous studies  <cit> , the amplitude of the mmn response to the non-native phoneme contrast, however, diminished between  <dig> and  <dig> months of age in full-term infants  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; figure 1; table 1). in contrast, in the prematurely born children, this reduction was not observed, and at the age of one year, the mmn amplitude in response to the non-native phoneme contrast was significantly higher in prematurely born children than in the children born full-term  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ). furthermore, there was a tendency for a right-left × group interaction  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) which was due to more enhanced mmn in the left hemisphere in children born premature than in the controls .

thevalues represent the corresponding means and standard deviations over six electrodes. the p-values represent the result of the anova analyses, indicating the significance of the between- group differences over all the electrodes.

at the age of  <dig> months, repeated measures anova revealed no significant difference in the mmn amplitude in response to native phoneme contrasts between the two groups of infants. however, the mmn latency was significantly shorter in children born full-term than in children born premature  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; table  <dig> ), indicating faster discrimination of native phonemes by the former. in the children born premature the mmn latency tended to shorten between  <dig> and  <dig> months of age  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) while no such changes in the mmn latency were observed in the children born full-term. at the age of one year, no significant difference in the mmn latency was found between prematurely born and full-term infants anymore. neither was there any significant difference in the mmn amplitude. the results indicate that the formation of long-term memory traces for native phonemes was already well-developed by the age of  <dig> months in the children born full-term, while in the very prematurely born children, the native-language phoneme discrimination still continued to develop up to the age of  <dig> months.

the language measures at  <dig> months did not yield any significant differences between the groups. at the age of two years, however, the prematurely born children produced significantly less words  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ), and had shorter msl, as indexed by the number of morphemes produced in sentences  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) than the full-term children. furthermore, the morphological structures of the sentences were less developed in the prematurely born children than in the full-term children  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ), as also reported in earlier studies  <cit> .

to explore whether phonetic discrimination abilities, as reflected by the mmn, are associated with behaviourally measured language skills, as reflected by the cdi, a correlation analysis was performed. the correlation analysis revealed that the larger was the mmn amplitude in response to the non-native phoneme at the age of one year, the less the child produced words , the less developed the morphology , and the shorter the msl was  at the age of two years. the findings indicate that those infants who did not acquire neural long-term representations specific to native-language phonemes at the age of one year, performed also worse in all subtests of the cdi language test at the age of two years.

in this study we examined the association between native and non-native phonetic discrimination in a group of monolingual, full-term, healthy children, and in a group of very prematurely born children. consistent with the previous studies  <cit>  we showed that long-term memory traces for native phonemes are well-developed in infants born full-term by the age of  <dig> months. in contrast, prematurely born infants continued to develop this ability up to the age of one year, as indexed by the shortening of the mmn latency. the most striking finding in these children, however, was that the discrimination of non-native phoneme contrasts strengthend from  <dig> to  <dig> months of age, which was negatively associated with several measures of linguistic skills at the age of two years. thus, the prematurely born infants appeared to continue to maintain their ability to discriminate accurately non-native phonemes at the age of one year. in contrast, children born full-term showed a decrease in their ability to discriminate non-native vowels, as is typical for normal development  <cit> .

the theory of native-language neural commitment  <cit>  suggests that normal language development involves plastic changes while the brain tunes itself to native phonemes at the expense of its ability to process unfamiliar phonemes. our study shows that this tuning is delayed or atypical in prematurely born infants. in prematurely born infants, an acoustically larger but non-native contrast evoked a larger brain response, suggesting that lower-level processing of physical acoustic characteristics is still dominating over language-specific processing at the age of one year. the result is in accordance with previous studies indicating a higher sensitivity to larger acoustic contrasts in infants born premature  <cit> . thus, the finding of the present study suggests that language problems in prematurely born children may partially originate already from this early tuning stage of language acquisition.

there is a possibility that children born premature have not only a deficit in perceptual narrowing but also a more general auditory processing deficit. further studies are needed to investigate the specificity of this deficit to native and non-native vowel contrasts. a new method, optima or multifeature paradigm  <cit> , enables the use of different deviants in the same paradigm, and would therefore be a valuable method to define auditory processing deficits in prematurely born children in more detail. it would also be interesting to follow-up the same group of children from infancy to later age to investigate whether children born premature and showing deficits either in auditory processing or language development ever catch up their peers.

premature birth constitutes a set of health risks for the infant. minor but common deficits, like atypical auditory processing and slight delays in language development, are in most cases not diagnosed. nevertheless these deficits may lead to later language and learning disabilities. information provided by this study might be crucial for the early identification of infants at-risk for later language and learning deficits. thus, prematurely born infants would benefit from information concerning their early language-related brain plasticity for early identification of infants at-risk for later language and learning deficits, and for introducing them to early interventions always when needed.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of our follow-up study show for the first time that perceptual narrowing for non-native phoneme contrasts found in the healthy controls at the age of one year was not encountered in very prematurely born infants. moreover, our results showed that this delayed or atypical perceptual narrowing was associated with slower language acquisition. the results hence suggest that language problems in prematurely born children may partially originate already from this early tuning stage of language acquisition. further studies are, however, needed to investigate whether this deficit is specific to perceptual narrowing or whether it is related to a more general auditory processing deficit and whether these children ever catch up their peers.
