BACKGROUND
streptococcus suis forms a problem in the swine industry. clinically healthy sows carry s. suis in their nasal cavities and on their tonsils, and transmit the bacteria to their piglets  <cit> , that develop a variety of infections, such as septicaemia, meningitis, polyarthritis, and endocarditis, and often do not survive  <cit> . s. suis occasionally causes meningitis, arthritis or endocarditis in humans. however, recently several large human outbreaks of s. suis have been described in china  <cit> , and thailand  <cit> , whilst s. suis meningitis has become endemic in vietnam  <cit> , suggesting that isolates that are more virulent to humans have emerged.

the s. suis population is very heterogeneous as different serotypes, phenotypes, and genotypes are found. to date  <dig> capsular serotypes have been described for s. suis  <cit>  of which serotypes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are most frequently isolated from diseased pigs in europe  <cit> . in northern america, besides these serotypes, serotypes  <dig> and  <dig> are frequently isolated from diseased animals  <cit> . on european farms, it was shown that up to 81% of healthy animals carried one or more serotypes simultaneously and different genotypes of the same serotype could be isolated at one timepoint from the same animal  <cit> . different phenotypes of serotype  <dig> were described that differ in their virulence; strains can be differentiated by protein expression of virulence markers muramidase released protein , extracellular factor  and suilysin   <cit> . besides variation in protein expression observed among s. suis strains, large heterogeneity also exists in gene composition  <cit> . recently, the genome sequence of s. suis serotype  <dig> strain p1/ <dig> became available  <cit>  enabling whole genome typing techniques for s. suis. in the present study, we performed oligonucleotide-based comparative genome hybridization  using the genome sequence of strain p1/ <dig> to evaluate gene conservation and diversity among s. suis strains. fifty-five well characterized s. suis strains of various serotypes were analyzed in this cgh study. results from cgh were clustered, and correlated with mlst data, serotyping results, and virulence of strains. we showed that groups of s. suis isolates can be identified by their own unique profile of putative virulence genes and regions of difference. besides, a core genome for s. suis was defined.

experimental infection in pigs
all animal experiments were approved by the ethical committee of the central veterinary institute of wageningen ur in accordance with the dutch law on animal experiments.

in this study virulence of s. suis isolates was strictly defined by the outcome of experimental infections. to study virulence of s. suis serotype  <dig> and  <dig> isolates, three successive experiments were performed in pigs. previous to infection all piglets were tested negative for s. suis carriership. in all experiments pigs were allotted to three or four groups each consisting of four or five pigs . in the first two experiments seventeen caesarian-derived germfree piglets were housed in stainless steel incubators as described before  <cit> . each piglet was infected at the age of  <dig> days with bordetella bronchiseptica  to predispose animals for subsequent s. suis infection. two days later animals were infected intranasally with exponentially growing s. suis strains .

in the third experiment, specific pathogen free  piglets with the age of  <dig> weeks were infected intranasally with s. suis serotype  <dig> isolates  without prior predisposition to b. bronchiseptica. piglets were kept in sternal position and forced to inhale an aerosol produced by an airbrush  after anaesthesia with 50% o2/50% n2o/3% halothane.

in all experiments, piglets were followed clinically with special regard to signs of meningitis and arthritis. swabs for bacteriological examination were taken daily from the oropharynx and faeces. pigs were killed either moribund or  <dig> days post infection at the end of the observation period by intravenous injection of pentobarbiturate followed by exsanguination and necropsy. tissue specimens from the central nervous system , serosae, and joints were examined bacteriologically and histologically  <cit> .

multi locus sequence typing 
mlst was performed as described by king et al.  <cit> . alternative primers for muts were used as described previously by rehm et al.  <cit> . chromosomal dna was isolated from stationary growing bacteria as described previously  <cit> . pcr reactions were performed using taq pcr core kit  according to the manufacturer's instructions, using  <dig> μl of diluted  chromosomal dna as template, containing at least  <dig> ng of dna. pcr products were visually inspected on 1% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide, and subsequently purified and sequenced by macrogen . sequence data were analyzed using lasergene software . mlst alleles and resulting sts were assigned using the database on http://ssuis.mlst.net/. new alleles and sts were assigned by the curator of the database. analysis of st complexes was performed with eburst http://www.mlst.net <cit> .

s. suis oligoarray
a s. suis oligoarray  containing in situ synthesized 60-mers was produced by agilent technologies , according to a custom probe design based on the genome sequence of s. suis p1/ <dig>  <cit> . a total of  <dig> unique 60-mers having a theoretical melting temperature of approximately 81°c and representing  <dig> orfs were selected as described by saulnier et al.  <cit> . genes were represented by  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , or  <dig> probe . a total of  <dig> putative genes were not represented on the array because no unique probe satisfying the selection criteria could be selected.

comparative genome hybridization 
chromosomal dna  was sheared in  <dig> ml shearing buffer , using nebulizers  under  <dig>  bar air pressure for  <dig> minutes to yield fragments between  <dig> and  <dig> bp. dna was ethanol precipitated, taken up in water and  <dig> μg of dna was column purified using illustra cyscribe gfx purification kit  according to instructions of the manufacturer. differential dna presence was determined by two-colour fluorescent hybridizations of the corresponding genomic dnas on the  <dig> ×  <dig> k s. suis oligo array. genomic dna of each strain was cohybridized once with the reference strain p1/ <dig>  that was always labeled with cy <dig>  the test strain was consequently labeled with cy <dig>  labeling of dna  was done using the bioprime array cgh genomic labeling system  with slight modifications as described by molenaar et al.,  <dig>  <cit> . labeling efficiency was measured using the nanodrop . constant amounts of label  were hybridized to the oligoarray in hybridization buffer of the in situ hybridization kit plus  following instructions of the manufacturer. during hybridization, slides were incubated for  <dig> h at 65°c under rotation. slides were washed for  <dig> min in  <dig> × ssc/ <dig> % triton-x <dig> at room temperature, followed by  <dig> min in  <dig>  × ssc/ <dig> % triton-x <dig> at 4°c. slides were dried using pressured air and scanned in a genepix 4200al scanner . scans were analyzed using genepix software . local background values were subtracted from the intensity of each spot. data were normalized using s-lowess  <cit>  at the webtool accessible from http://bioinformatics.biol.rug.nl/websoftware/s-lowess. normalized data were imported into acuity software  for further analysis. cut-off values for presence/absence of genes were empirically determined by comparing microarray results to classic hybridization results using about  <dig> radioactively labeled probes on spotted chromosomal dna . it was determined that a log ratio above - <dig>  indicated the gene was present and very homologous to the gene in p1/ <dig>  whereas a log ratio above - <dig>  indicated that the gene was present, but variation in nucleotide composition existed among isolates. a ratio between - <dig>  and - <dig> indicated slight variation, whereas a ratio between - <dig> and - <dig>  indicated large variation. a gene was designated "absent" from a genome when all probes for that gene had a normalized log ratio below - <dig> .

dendrograms
cgh data was clustered using acuity software to determine similarity of isolates tested in the cgh. hierarchical clustering of isolates was done by clustering arrays based on ranked correlation coefficients , where linkage was determined using the average neighbours method. p-values were calculated by multiscale bootstrap resampling  with the r package pvclust using the average agglomerative method and by the absolute correlative distance measure. the presence of putative virulence genes among isolates, as well as the presence of regions of difference among isolates, was visualized in dendrograms using bionumerics  to study similarity among isolates. these data were analyzed using the pearson product-moment correlation coefficient. cluster analysis was done with the unweighted pair group method using arithmetic averages  with a 1% optimization for position tolerance.

RESULTS
clustering of isolates as determined by cgh
cgh was used to study genomic diversity among s. suis isolates. s. suis isolates from different serotypes, isolated from different hosts, from different clinical sources, and from different geographical locations were included in the study . the dendrogram depicting the cgh data  shows that isolates were divided into  <dig> clusters, a and b, whereas the negative control e. coli strain was assigned to cluster c. this indicates that there are extensive genetic differences between s. suis isolates belonging to clusters a and b. statistical analysis showed that subclustering of isolates in cluster b was highly significant , whereas subclustering of isolates in cluster a was less significant. this is probably due to high similarity among cluster a isolates. one statistical outlier was identified, isolate  <dig> clustered with e. coli  in a separate cluster due to low microarray signals. this was only detected after multiple bootstrap resampling.

cluster a exclusively contained serotype  <dig> and  <dig> isolates, except for one , indicating that these serotypes are genetically very similar. isolate  <dig> was identified to be poly-agglutinable in a slide agglutination test, although cgh data showed this isolate contains cps genes of serotype  <dig>  suggesting the isolate belongs to serotype  <dig> but does not express  capsule genes sufficiently to be detected in slide agglutination. all isolates in cluster a expressed either ef protein or the larger form ef* protein  <cit> , whereas none of the isolates clustered in group b expressed either of these proteins. mlst analysis showed that with the exception of serotype  <dig> isolate  <dig>  all isolates in cluster a belonged to clonal complex  <dig>  within which most isolates were found to represent sequence type  <dig>  whereas others represented single locus variants of st <dig>  six subclusters  were distinguished in cluster a. cluster a <dig> contained mrp+ef+ serotype  <dig> isolates from different geographical locations  that were isolated from humans and pigs, indicating the global spreading of these isolates. cluster a <dig> exclusively contained serotype  <dig> isolates from vietnam either obtained from human patients or from pigs  <cit> , suggesting these vietnamese isolates are highly similar to each other. discrimination of isolates of the subclusters a <dig> - a <dig> was based on sequence diversity between genes, rather than on differences in gene content.

in contrast to cluster a, cluster b contained a more divergent, heterogeneous group of isolates. cluster b contained all serotype  <dig> and  <dig> isolates included in this study as well as a number of less virulent serotype  <dig> and serotype  <dig> isolates that neither express mrp nor ef. within cluster b five subclusters were distinguished . subclusters b <dig> and b <dig> contained all serotype  <dig> isolates, as well as a number of mrp-ef- serotype  <dig> isolates  <cit> . the high degree of similarity observed between mrp-ef- serotype  <dig> and serotype  <dig> isolates could suggest that the mrp-ef- serotype  <dig> isolates originated from serotype  <dig> isolates by an exchange of capsular genes. this idea is supported by mlst data which showed that most isolates within the clusters b <dig> and b <dig> share the same clonal complex  as well as by aflp-data in which these isolates also clustered together . cluster b <dig> was a very heterogeneous group of isolates that seemed to contain isolates that were clustered based on lack of genetic similarity to each other and to other strains. surprisingly, the reference strain of serotype  <dig>  was assigned to cluster b <dig> as well, at large distance from other serotype  <dig> isolates in cluster b <dig>  this clearly indicates that the reference strain does not represent the european serotype  <dig> isolates from the field used in this study. this was confirmed by mlst data, since this reference strain was assigned to st <dig>  an independent st, outside a lineage. cluster b <dig> contained two serotype  <dig> isolates among which the reference strain of serotype  <dig> , indicating extensive sequence differences between serotype  <dig> strains in cluster b <dig> and serotype  <dig> strains in cluster a. in contrast to the serotype  <dig> isolates present in cluster a, both isolates in cluster b <dig> were negative for expression of mrp and ef and belonged to cc <dig>  whereas all serotype  <dig> isolates in cluster a belonged to cc <dig>  therefore, the reference strain for serotype  <dig> at best represents part of the serotype  <dig> population. cluster b <dig> contained serotype  <dig> isolates belonging to cc <dig> as well as a serotype  <dig> isolate from a human patient and a serotype  <dig> isolate both belonging to cc <dig> 

virulence of s. suis isolates of serotype  <dig> and 9
to be able to study the correlation of gene content of isolates with virulence, we determined the virulence of serotype  <dig> and  <dig> isolates used in this study in experimental infections in pigs in comparison to the virulence of serotype  <dig> strain  <dig>  <cit> . the reference strains of serotype  <dig> and  <dig> were included in this experimental infection, as well as  <dig> -  <dig> field isolates of both serotypes. table  <dig> shows that although serotype  <dig> reference strain nctc10273r <dig> showed less clinical signs than serotype  <dig> strain  <dig>  mortality of serotype  <dig> reference strain was 100% whereas strain  <dig> showed only 50% mortality. four piglets infected with this serotype  <dig> strain showed pathological abnormalities in joints. based on morbidity, mortality and pathological abnormalities in > 50% of piglets, isolate nctc10273r <dig> is considered virulent, like strain  <dig>  serotype  <dig> isolates  <dig> and  <dig> also showed a mortality rate of 100%. the mean number of days until death of these animals was  <dig> days, whereas for piglets infected with the serotype  <dig> reference strain this was  <dig>  days. animals infected with strain  <dig> showed 50% mortality and a mean number of days until death of more than  <dig> days post-infection. isolates  <dig> and  <dig> induced pathological abnormalities in cns in  <dig> out of  <dig> piglets and  <dig> out of  <dig> piglets, respectively. based on these observations, these serotype  <dig> isolates are considered more virulent than strain  <dig> and are therefore considered highly virulent. serotype  <dig> isolates did not show any clinical symptoms after an intranasal infection with  <dig> cfu , whereas strain  <dig> showed 50% mortality and a mean number of days until death of  <dig> . even an infection dose of  <dig> cfu of serotype  <dig> only induced mild clinical signs, and sparse pathological findings. this led to the conclusion that the serotype  <dig> isolates tested in our experimental infection model should be considered avirulent, although they can induce mild clinical symptoms at a higher dose.

virulence of isolates as determined in experimental infections in pigs was depicted in the dendrogram of cgh data . except for the virulent reference strain of serotype  <dig> that was assigned to cluster b <dig>  all avirulent isolates were assigned to cluster b, whereas all virulent, highly virulent and weakly virulent isolates were assigned to cluster a. mlst data confirmed these findings, since all isolates in cluster a, except for isolate  <dig>  belonged to mlst cc <dig> that was described to have a strong correlation with invasive diseases, like septicemia, meningitis and arthritis  <cit> . all asian human isolates that were obtained from meningitis and sepsis patients were assigned to cluster a as well. the only dutch human isolate from a meningitis patient  was shown to be avirulent in an experimental infection in piglets, and was assigned to cluster b, clearly indicating that this isolate is genetically distinct from the highly virulent asian human isolates  <cit> .

distribution of putative virulence related genes among s. suis serotype  <dig> isolates
to correlate virulence of isolates with specific genes, we next studied the distribution of  <dig> genes encoding putative virulence proteins in serotype  <dig> isolates among isolates. genes were selected that were described to be involved in pathogenesis or virulence of s. suis. clustering of these results into a dendrogram assigned all isolates to  <dig> different virulence clusters  . this clustering was very similar to the clustering based on the cgh data, although some isolates were clustered with isolates that belonged to another cgh cluster. isolates assigned to cluster v <dig>  contained all selected putative virulence genes, whereas isolates assigned to clusters v <dig>  v <dig>  v <dig>  v <dig>  v <dig> and v <dig>  lacked  <dig> to  <dig> of these genes. all cluster b isolates lacked either one or more sortase genes that are involved in assembly of pili  <cit> . serotype  <dig> isolates all clustered to v <dig> together with mrp-ef- serotype  <dig> isolates. all v <dig> isolates lacked regulator of virulence revs, epf and srtb and srtc, whereas they contained srte, srtf and two isolates contained srtd, but with extensive sequence variation. serotype  <dig> isolates fell apart in two different clusters, v <dig> and v <dig>  cluster v <dig> lacked iga protease, srtf, and epf, and showed minor sequence variation in apua and fbps. v <dig> isolates lacked at least  <dig> putative virulence genes, among which all sortase genes. this indicated that v <dig> isolates are incapable of pilus formation, and are thereby likely to be less virulent. taken together, our data suggests that differences in virulence exist within the serotype  <dig> population. extensive sequence variation in a limited number of putative virulence genes  was detected in isolates belonging to clusters v <dig>  v <dig>  v <dig>  v <dig>  v <dig> and v <dig>  but not in v <dig> isolates . this suggests that v <dig> isolates are genetically more similar to each other and to p1/ <dig>  the array strain. v <dig> isolates exclusively express ef, none of the isolates in clusters v <dig>  v <dig>  v <dig>  v <dig>  v <dig> express ef . in this study we show that most isolates are unable to express the protein since they lacked the epf gene encoding ef. two v <dig> isolates have a silent epf gene. presence of mrp and sly genes was less indicative for protein expression. isolates  <dig>   <dig>  ov <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> contained the suilysin gene, but did not express the protein under in vitro conditions . almost all isolates tested in this study contained the mrp gene, whereas less than half expressed the protein under in vitro conditions   <cit> .

regions of differences and core genome of s. suis
to further explore genetic diversity between s. suis isolates, regions of difference  were identified, which were defined as at least three consecutive orfs that were absent from at least one strain. thirty-nine rds that varied in size from  <dig> bp to  <dig> kbp were identified. the largest rd  contained cps genes encoding serotype specific polysaccharide capsule of p1/ <dig>  . other rds contained abc transporters, restriction modification systems, signal peptidases , several transporters, two-component systems and several other genes .

clustering of rd distribution among isolates in a dendrogram resulted in an identical clustering compared to cgh clustering, indicating that rds mainly determine the differences between isolates as detected by cgh . within cluster a, subclusters could not be discriminated based on the absence/presence of specific rds, since most rds were universally present within cluster a isolates. distribution of rds among cluster b was more heterogeneous. three isolates from cluster b <dig>  were responsible for a good deal of diversity:  <dig> rds representing  <dig> genes were only absent in one or more of these isolates; whereas in total at least  <dig> rds are missing from these isolates. thus, these isolates are atypical within our selection of isolates. serotype  <dig> and  <dig> isolates  also lacked considerable numbers of rds. for some rds , gc content differed considerably from overall gc content of the genome , indicating these rds might have been acquired from other species by horizontal gene transfer, since foreign dna can often be recognized by its variation from the majority of the genome in base composition or codon preference. the gene content of rds shows that these regions contain specific beneficial traits like rm systems, abc transporters, or two-component systems, making it attractive regions to acquire.

a core genome for s. suis was defined by selecting genes that were present in all s. suis isolates tested. the resulting core genome of s. suis consisted of  <dig> genes  out of  <dig> genes present on our array. of those  <dig> genes,  <dig> genes represent pseudogenes in p1/ <dig>  composition of the core genome of s. suis was studied using the classification in clusters of orthologous groups of proteins . figure  <dig> displays the relative representation of each cog category in both p1/ <dig> as well as in the core genome. most cog categories were equally represented in both genomes. however, cog categories j , e  and f  were found to be overrepresented in the core genome. in conclusion, all isolates in our study share  <dig> genes. the overrepresentation of the structural gene categories j, e, and f suggest this core genome suffices for growth, division and survival, whereas additional, beneficial traits are mainly encoded by rds.

discussion
comparative genome hybridization  was used to study genetic heterogeneity among a collection of  <dig> s. suis isolates. s. suis isolates were assigned to two clusters .

cgh data was compared with mlst and pulse field gel electrophoresis   <cit>  and amplified fragment length polymorphism  <cit> . in general there was a lot of congruence between typing methods. the discriminatory power of cgh is larger than that of mlst analysis, since isolates that belong to mlst cc <dig> can be divided into subclusters using cgh. moreover, vietnamese isolates that belong to different pulse field types, were assigned to the same cgh subcluster  <cit> . this could be explained by genomic inversions and substitutions, that were observed in the genome of the vietnamese reference strain bm <dig> in comparison to p1/ <dig>  <cit> . these changes can be discriminated by pfge, but not by cgh.

to correlate virulence of isolates to cgh results, virulence of serotype  <dig> and serotype  <dig> isolates was determined in an experimental infection. for serotype  <dig>  our animal experiment showed that in contrast to the field isolates, the reference strain was not highly virulent. since serotype  <dig> only induced clinical symptoms at very high doses, we concluded that serotype  <dig> isolates were avirulent under experimental conditions. this was confirmed by other studies  <cit> . to correlate virulence to cgh data, distribution of  <dig> putative virulence genes among s. suis isolates was studied. each cgh cluster was shown to be associated with a specific profile of putative virulence genes. cluster a isolates contained all  <dig> putative virulence genes. cluster b isolates on the contrary lacked up to  <dig> putative virulence genes among which one or more of sortase genes  that are involved in assembly of pili  <cit> . in agreement with data presented here, takamatsu et al. showed that cc <dig> isolates contained all srt genes, whereas cc <dig> isolates lacked srtbcd genes  <cit> . however, none of our serotype  <dig> isolates contained the srtbcd gene cluster, whereas this cluster was detected in a japanese serotype  <dig> isolate  <cit> . this could imply geographical variation. moreover, the revs gene is absent from all cluster b isolates, with the exception of cluster b <dig> isolates. this regulator influences expression of putative virulence factors  <cit> . therefore, lack of revs might affect virulence of isolates. the iga <dig> protease gene was found to be absent in all serotype  <dig> isolates, and displayed extensive sequence variation in serotype  <dig> isolates. all serotype  <dig> isolates including the avirulent isolates contained the iga <dig> protease gene. zhang et al. showed that most pathogenic serotype  <dig> isolates contained the iga <dig> protease gene, whereas the gene was sparsely found in non-invasive serotype  <dig> isolates  <cit> . in the latter study mainly isolates obtained in china were used. sequence variation among isolates belonging to cluster b was observed for other putative virulence genes as well, like ofs, glna, fbps and apua. the ofs gene was highly conserved among virulent serotype  <dig> and  <dig> isolates but showed extensive sequence diversity in avirulent serotype  <dig> and serotype  <dig> isolates, as was also described by takamatsu et al  <cit> . interestingly, at least two of the ofs positive serotype  <dig> strains do not express ofs in vitro, as shown in the serum opacification assay  <cit> . this suggests the presence of silent ofs genes. a silent epf gene was present in isolates in cluster b <dig>  two of the b <dig> isolates  expressed the enlarged version of mrp, but none of the probes used for the cgh hybridized to the mrp gene, suggesting extensive sequence variation exists between different serotype  <dig> isolates. the presence of a mrp gene in the two isolates was confirmed by pcr analysis . serotype  <dig> isolates were distributed among  <dig> virulence clusters, v <dig> and v <dig> that differed considerably in their distribution of putative virulence genes. this suggests differences in virulence exist among serotype  <dig> isolates that were not identified in our experimental infection model.

avirulent mrp-ef- serotype  <dig> isolates clustered together with serotype  <dig> isolates both by cgh as well as by mlst. such a clustering is in agreement with previous studies  <cit> . the clustering strongly suggests similarity in genetic background between the isolates and could suggest that the avirulent serotype  <dig> isolates originated from serotype  <dig> isolates after the exchange of the capsular genes. capsular exchange has been described for other streptococci like gbs  <cit>  and streptococcus pneumonia  <cit> . in this study  <dig> regions of differences  were identified, that might contribute to virulence or survival in the host based on the predicted functions of the genes associated with the various rds. for example  <dig> rds encode two-component regulatory systems and  <dig> rds encode putative virulence genes. in addition,  <dig> phosphotransferase systems, and  <dig> abc transporters were identified. since the gc content of some rds differed considerably compared to the whole genome of s. suis, these rds could have originated from horizontal gene transfer. this suggestion can be supported by the finding that many rds contained transposases, integrases or phage proteins which are all involved in gene transfer.

a core genome for s. suis was defined that contained 78% of p1/ <dig> orfs. this percentage is in the same order of magnitude as for other streptococcal core genomes. a small percentage  of the core genome is represented by pseudogenes in p1/ <dig>  since single nucleotide differences cannot be detected using cgh, additional putative pseudogenes present in other isolates will not be identified. this could lead to a small overestimation of the core genome. in p1/ <dig> cog category g, carbohydrate transport and metabolism, is overrepresented compared to the core genome. this could reflect genes that are not essential to s. suis, but make s. suis strains carrying these gene more versatile in their carbon source usage. recent publications suggest carbon source usage may be an important virulence trait for streptococci  <cit> , which implies the more versatile s. suis isolates could benefit in pathogenesis. since the core genome includes genes that are shared by all isolates included in our study, representing virulent as well as avirulent isolates, it is not very likely the core genome alone is sufficient for virulence. this is confirmed by the finding of several genes putatively involved in virulence in the rd regions of p1/ <dig> that probably attribute to virulence or survival in the host of p1/ <dig>  however, since all isolates, including avirulent ones like t <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> , can colonize porcine tonsils, the core genome might be sufficient for colonization.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we show that cgh is a valuable method. not only can it be used for genotyping of s. suis isolates, but cgh also gives information on phylogeny of isolates, and can be used to look for specific gene content, like virulence genes, or sequence variation among isolates. at present a disadvantage of cgh using the current microarray is the one way character of the technology; only distribution of genes present in p1/ <dig> can be studied using the current microarray. recently, several s. suis isolates have been sequenced adding new information to the s. suis pangenome. the chinese human isolates were shown to contain an additional putative pathogenicity island  of  <dig> kb compared to p1/ <dig>  <cit> , whereas the vietnamese strain bm <dig> contained another additional pi compared to p1/ <dig>  <cit> . both pi's were shown to contain integrative and conjugative elements  not present in p1/ <dig>  the current microarray will have to be extended with genome sequences of other s. suis isolates to be a better representation of the s. suis pangenome.
