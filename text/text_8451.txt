BACKGROUND
surviving in an alien world is dependent upon the ability to distinguish between sensory inputs arising from self actions and those of others. the question of how the brain identifies self in an external environment has been discussed for decades. a well-accepted idea first introduced by von helmholtz  <cit>  and further expanded upon by von holst and sperry  <cit>  in the visual system, suggested that the brain issues a copy of the motor commands  to predict sensory consequences of self-generated eye movements. the idea of sensory predictions based on efference copies has emerged as an important theoretical concept for sensory-motor integration in different modalities such as visual  <cit> , auditory  <cit> , and somatosensory  <cit>  systems. according to this theory, the brain is capable of determining the source of sensory stimulation  by comparing efference copies of the motor predictions  with the actual sensory stimuli. this process has been suggested to be mediated by subtractive comparison between corollary discharges and incoming feedback and has been proposed to result in motor-induced suppression  of self-generated sensory inputs that closely match the internal predictions.

the mis of neural responses to self-generated sensory input has been suggested to result in different sensory neural processing of self vs. externally-generated feedback. in the somatosensory system, mis was demonstrated by a reduction in the perceptual sensation of self-produced tactile stimulations compared with the same stimuli delivered by an external agent  <cit> . the early evidence for mis in the auditory system comes from studies by müller-preuss et al.  <cit>  in squirrel monkeys in which it was shown that the electrical stimulation of vocal motor brain areas results in the reduction of activity in cortical auditory neurons. a similar effect was observed during voluntary sound production in crickets  <cit>  and voluntary vocal production in marmoset monkeys  <cit> , showing that auditory neural responses to self-produced auditory feedback were suppressed during active sound production compared with passive listening to the playback of the same auditory stimuli. in humans, the n <dig> component of event-related potentials  and its magnetoencephalographic  counterpart  were shown to be suppressed in response to the onset of unaltered voice auditory feedback during active vocal production compared with passive listening  <cit> . moreover, auditory neural responses to self-triggered  tone stimuli were shown to be suppressed compared with those in response identical stimuli triggered by a computer  <cit> .

a study by heinks-maldonado et al.  <cit>  reported a similar suppression effect for n <dig> erp responses to voice feedback during vocal production and demonstrated that the mis of the n <dig> component at voice onset is largest for unaltered voice feedback and was reduced for conditions where voice feedback was pitch shifted  or modified with an alien voice. heinks-maldonado et al.  <cit>  suggested that n <dig> suppression was largest for unaltered voice feedback because motor predictions could maximally cancel the actual sensory input when the voice and its auditory feedback closely matched . this finding led to the hypothesis that identification of self-vocalizations, as measured by the suppression of n <dig> erp responses, depends on the extent to which the acoustical parameters of voice feedback match the internal predictions about the intended vocal output, represented by the efference copies of motor commands during vocalization.

in order to test this hypothesis, it is necessary to specify the acoustical parameters that distinguish our own voices from those of others. since voices can differ along many acoustical dimensions simultaneously , it is important to control the effect of all parameters while we investigate the effect of a single element in this identification process. as suggested by heinks-maldonado et al.  <cit> , pitch frequency is possibly one of the factors that can help us distinguish between our own voices and those of other speakers. however, the acoustical parameters of the alien voices in their study  <cit>  that led to the identification of self-vocalizations and consequently suppression of auditory neural responses to voice feedback during vocal production were not specified. there are several acoustical parameters  that can co-vary between one's own voice and those of others, and to understand the neural mechanisms involved in this process, it is necessary to learn which acoustical properties account for the suppression of self-voice.

in the present study, we tested the hypothesis that mis of n <dig> responses to voice onset can be modulated by the degree of disparity between pitch frequencies of actual  and internally-predicted  voice feedback. erps were recorded in response to five different magnitudes  of voice-onset pitch feedback perturbation during active vocalization and passive listening to the playback. the magnitude of pitch shift stimuli  was systematically increased to address the question how previously reported mis of the n <dig> component is modulated for different levels of error in vocal pitch feedback. we predicted that the n <dig> suppression would be greatest for the unaltered voice feedback condition when there is no pitch disparity  between actual and intended voice output. however, when errors are introduced by pitch shifting the voice auditory feedback, mis of n <dig> responses was predicted to be reduced during active vocalization compared with passive listening at voice onset.

RESULTS
spss  was used to perform two-way  repeated-measures analysis of variances  to separately analyze n <dig> responses  for different pss magnitudes at voice onset with factors including condition  and electrode position . the reported p-values associated with the statistical tests were corrected using greenhouse-geisser or huynh-feldt methods in conditions where the mauchly's test indicated that the assumption of spherecity was violated . these methods correct for the violation of spherecity by choosing more stringent criteria for determining the degrees of freedom for the independent variables to ensure that the obtained f-values are valid. results of the analysis for n <dig> revealed a significant main effect of condition for  <dig>  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ),  <dig>  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ),  <dig>  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) and  <dig>  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) cents pss magnitudes but not for  <dig> cents pss  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ). these results indicated that the n <dig> responses were significantly suppressed during active vocalization compared with passive listening only for pitch perturbations that were equal to or smaller than  <dig> cents but not for  <dig> cents perturbations . a significant main effect of electrode position was also found for all tested pss magnitudes including  <dig>  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ),  <dig> =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ),  <dig>  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ),  <dig>  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) and  <dig>  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) cents. no significant condition × electrode position interaction was found for n <dig> responses to different pss magnitudes, indicating that the scalp distribution of the n <dig> component was not significantly different during active vocalization compared with passive listening across pss magnitudes .

the n <dig> responses were also separately analyzed for active vocalization and passive listening conditions using two-way  rm-anovas with factors including pss magnitude  and electrode position. results revealed significant main effects of pss magnitude  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ), electrode position  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) and a significant pss magnitude × electrode position  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) interaction for n <dig> responses during active vocalization. post-hoc tests using bonferroni's adjustment revealed that the significant main effect of pss magnitude was due to significant differences between n <dig> responses for  <dig> vs.  <dig> ,  <dig> vs.  <dig> ,  <dig> vs.  <dig> cents  and  <dig> vs.  <dig> cents  stimulus magnitudes, indicating that  <dig> cents pss elicited significantly larger  n <dig> responses compared with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cents stimuli at voice onset. the significant pss magnitude × electrode position interaction indicated that the scalp distributions of n <dig> were different across stimulus magnitudes during active vocalization . for the passive listening condition, results revealed only a significant main effect of electrode position  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ). the absence of a pss magnitude effect indicated that there were no systematic changes of n <dig> responses as a function of stimulus magnitude during passive listening. the absence of a pss magnitude × electrode position interaction for passive listening indicated that there was no significant difference between scalp distributions of n <dig> across different stimulus magnitudes in this condition .

the normalized n <dig> suppression in percentage was calculated for each subject according to the following formula in which n1lis and n1voc are the peak amplitude of the n <dig> component during passive listening and active vocalization, respectively:  

this normalized suppression index was first calculated across all  <dig> eeg channels for each subject and then grand averaged over all the subjects. the bar plots in figure  <dig> show the mean percentage of suppression for normalized n <dig> amplitudes and the error bars represent the standard error values for different pss magnitudes averaged over  <dig> subjects.

results of the analysis for p <dig> potentials  using a two-way  rm-anova with condition and electrode position factors only revealed a significant main effect of electrode position for  <dig>  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) and  <dig>  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) cent pitch shift stimuli. p <dig> responses were also analyzed using two-way  rm-anovas for active vocalization and passive listening conditions separately with factors including pss magnitude and electrode position. during active vocalization, results revealed only a significant pss magnitude × electrode position interaction  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ). during passive listening, results of the analysis did not reveal any significant effect.

discussion
in the present study, the pitch perturbation paradigm was used to address the question of whether the extent of disparity between voice f <dig> output and its auditory feedback modulates motor-induced suppression of auditory neural responses at voice onset. results of the analysis showed that the n <dig> erp component was significantly suppressed during active vocalization compared with passive listening to unaltered  and pitch-shifted voice feedback at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cents stimulus magnitudes . however, when voice f <dig> feedback was shifted at  <dig> cents, the n <dig> suppression was almost completely eliminated. also, the calculation of the normalized n <dig> suppression showed that the mean of normalized n <dig> suppression was largest  for unaltered voice feedback  and decreased to 37%, 41%, 26% and 5% for pitch shift magnitudes of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cents, respectively .

separate analysis of active vocalization and passive listening conditions revealed that the maximum n <dig> suppression for unaltered feedback and its reduction or elimination for pitch-shifted feedback resulted from a finding that during vocalization, the amplitude of n <dig> responses became larger  as the pss magnitude increased whereas no such systematic changes of n <dig> responses occurred across pss magnitude during passive listening. our results indicated that  <dig> cents pitch-shifts elicited n <dig> responses that were significantly larger  than those elicited by  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> cents shifts during vocalization. however, no such a difference was observed for n <dig> responses to different stimulus magnitudes during passive listening. these findings indicate that the motor-induced suppression develops for small and moderately large disparities  between predicted  and actual voice f <dig> feedback but not for very large shifts .

in addition, our results revealed a significant pss magnitude × electrode position interaction only during active vocalization, indicating that the scalp distribution of n <dig> responses were different across stimulus magnitudes. as can be seen in figure  <dig>  n <dig> potentials have a prominent fronto-central distribution for  <dig> cents pss magnitude that is different from those for other stimuli. this difference arises from larger  neural responses to the largest pitch error in voice feedback  compared with smaller stimulus magnitudes during active vocalization, indicating that the motor-induced modulation of neural generators of n <dig> is different for larger compared with smaller disparities between vocal pitch output and its auditory feedback.

the findings of the present study are consistent with those of heinks-maldonado et al.  <cit>  in which it was shown that the mis of auditory neural responses at voice onset were greater for unaltered voice feedback and became smaller as feedback was pitch shifted or modified with an alien voice. in addition, results of our study expand upon the findings by heinks-maldonado et al.  <cit>  by showing that mis decreases or is even eliminated  with increases in the magnitude of pitch perturbation in voice auditory feedback.

other studies have suggested that, in addition to the acoustical parameters , the disparity between spatial and temporal aspects of self-generated feedback with respect to efference copies can also modulate the neural processing of sensory input during execution of motor tasks. in the somatosensory system, perturbation in the trajectory and onset time of self-generated tactile stimulations were associated with an increase in the intensity of tickle sensation, indicating that unpredictable feedback was less suppressed by efference copies of motor commands  <cit> . in the auditory system, mis of auditory responses was shown to develop only for conditions where there was no delay between the onset of motor actions such as button press  <cit>  or vocalization  <cit>  and the onset of auditory stimuli . similarly, auditory neural responses to self-triggered  tones were shown to be maximally suppressed compared with passive listening for conditions where the frequency and onset time of stimuli were predictable, and the suppression was reduced if the frequency or onset time was unpredictable  <cit> . consistently, results of the present study indicate that pitch predictability with relevance to efference copies for unaltered voice feedback results in a greater mis of auditory responses compared with pitch-shifted feedback.

the mis effects described above support the notion of an internal forward model for execution and monitoring of self-produced motor tasks. the forward model is suggested to incorporate efference copies of the motor commands that are used to make a comparison with actual sensory feedback  <cit> . this comparison examines the degree of disparity between spatial , temporal  or acoustical  features of sensory feedback and the efference-based predictions that affect the processing of sensory neural information. this characteristic may enable the sensory-motor mechanisms to identify the source of sensory stimulations by monitoring the degree of feedback predictability via efference copies to distinguish between self- and externally-generated inputs. our results suggest that the onset of unaltered voice feedback elicits n <dig> responses that are maximally suppressed by the efference copies of motor commands during vocal production. suppression becomes less pronounced for moderate pitch disparities  and is almost completely eliminated for large pitch shifts  in voice feedback. these findings indicate that the pitch frequency is possibly one of the important voice components in identification of self-voices during vocalization or speaking.

in addition to a role of mis in identifying the source of feedback, suppression of auditory neural responses was suggested to play an important role in enhancing neural sensitivity for detecting unexpected changes  in self-voice feedback. a study by eliades and wang  <cit>  showed that while marmoset monkeys vocalized and received their own unaltered voice feedback, some cortical auditory neurons reduced their firing rate , but then significantly increased their activity in response to pitch-shifted voice feedback. however, other neurons that increased their discharge rate  in responses to unaltered voice feedback during vocal production did not respond to pitch shifts in voice auditory feedback. these data suggest that during vocal production, mis of some cortical auditory neurons by means of efference copies of motor commands may provide a mechanism to enhance their neural sensitivity for pitch error detection in the feedback of self-produced vocalizations. it has also been demonstrated in humans that when pitch shifts were presented after the onset of self-produced voice  <cit>  or musical sounds  <cit> , erp responses were enhanced during active production of the motor task  compared with when subjects passively listened to the playback of the same self-produced voices or music.

however, the extent of vocalization-induced enhancement was shown to be greater for  <dig> and  <dig> cents compared with  <dig> cents stimulus magnitude  <cit> . this latter effect was suggested to occur due to the fact that the motor act of vocalization increases neural sensitivity to detect f <dig> feedback perturbations in order to accurately detect and correct for vocal pitch errors during speaking. however, when feedback pitch was shifted at  <dig> cents, the vocalization-induced enhancement of erps was reduced, suggesting the system may have interpreted it as an external sound, and consequently became less sensitive. therefore, identification of the source of auditory stimulation and systematic tuning of neural sensitivity based on the degree of disparity between voice f <dig> and its feedback may be important for vocal production because if the audio-vocal system was equally sensitive to pitch changes in self and externally-generated voices, variations in the pitch of environmental sounds or voices from different speakers could possibly lead to fluctuations in a person's voice during speaking.

despite the fact that pss magnitude is shown to modulate neural responses to voice feedback, it is still not clearly understood why erps  are suppressed at voice onset  <cit>  and, in contrast, are enhanced  when the pitch shifts occur in the middle of vocalizations  <cit> . one possible explanation for the differential effect of stimulus onset time is that the reduction of n <dig> suppression at voice onset for larger pss magnitudes reported previously  <cit>  and in the present study may reflect mechanisms that enable the system to monitor and maintain an intended vocal output by subtractive comparison between actual voice feedback and internal representations provided by efference copies. therefore, the unaltered auditory feedback from self-generated vocalizations that closely match the internally-represented feedback are more strongly suppressed at voice onset because they are fully predicted by the efference copies of motor commands. however, after voice onset, feedback-based monitoring of vocal output may rely on comparing the current state of incoming feedback with a representation that is continuously updated by feedback from previous vocalization states. therefore, instead of suppression, the audio-vocal system becomes more sensitive and highly responsive when disparities emerge between the parameters of voice and its feedback in the middle of vocalization.

the above explanation suggests that the system performs at least two different functions, which require different mechanisms: one function of monitoring voice auditory feedback is to identify the source of voice feedback  <cit> , and the second function is to correct for errors in production  <cit> . the first function takes place at the onset of vocalization, whereas the second function is activated after vocal onset and becomes important during vocalization  <cit> . while the details of these processes remain unknown, the suppression of cortical neural activity at vocal onset by means of motor-driven mechanisms may contribute to enhancing neural sensitivity for detecting pitch variations during vocal production. the brain may utilize the motor predictions to determine the source of incoming feedback in order to systematically decrease neural sensitivity to variations in the feedback of those voices that are not recognized as being self-generated. this proposal is supported by earlier findings in primates suggesting that there might possibly be a link between neural suppression and sensitivity enhancement to unexpected changes in voice f <dig> feedback  <cit> . because the n <dig> component in the present study was most sensitive to feedback perturbations at vocal onset, and the p <dig> component is most sensitive to perturbations during vocalization  <cit> , it is reasonable to suppose that these components represent the two different functions of the audio-vocal system, identification of self from external, and the monitoring of self vocalization.

with relevance to the neural processes of voice monitoring and control leading to mis of auditory responses discussed above, a question remains as to what brain areas are involved in auditory feedback-based monitoring and control of vocal output during vocal production or speech. the anatomical organization of the audio-vocal mechanism has been widely studied using functional neuroimaging techniques in a variety of speech production and perception tasks. results of these studies proposed an audio-vocal integration circuitry, including neural areas such as the superior temporal gyrus , superior temporal sulcus , planum temporale , pre-motor cortex , inferior frontal gyrus , anterior insula  <cit>  and the anterior cingulate cortex   <cit>  that may be involved in online monitoring and control of voice f <dig>  moreover, the bilateral increase in the activity of the superior temporal areas  was reported in studies when human subjects received pitch-shifted feedback of their own voice compared with unaltered feedback during vocal production  <cit> . a similar effect of increased activity in superior temporal areas was also reported in conditions where feedback disparity was generated by introducing formant shifts  <cit>  or voice-gated noise  <cit>  in the auditory feedback during self-vocalization. the superior temporal activities were also shown to be significantly greater for passive listening to the playback of self-speech compared with when subjects actively produced them  <cit> . results of the above neuroimaging studies are consistent with findings of the electrophysiological recordings in the present study that showed the increase in n <dig> activity  for larger pitch errors  in voice feedback during active vocalization, leading to diminished mis for larger pitch errors in voice feedback during vocalization compared with passive listening. these results suggest that the suppression of cortical auditory areas is likely to arise from neural mechanisms that utilize an internally-predicted representation  of intended vocal output to monitor and control for feedback pitch error during active vocal production of speech sounds. such a characteristic may be an important aspect of sensory-motor integration for distinguishing external  from self-generated stimuli for maintaining the acoustical parameters of intended vocal output.

CONCLUSIONS
the findings of the present study provide supporting evidence for the existence of an internal forward model during speech production. the results indicated that the motor-induced suppression of auditory neural responses is maximal for normal compared with pitch-shifted voice feedback. this effect suggests that the motor act of vocalization suppresses the sensory consequences of self-produced vocal output that is predicted by the efference copies of motor commands. however, when voice feedback is different from efference predictions, suppression is reduced or completely eliminated. this characteristic may represent the ability of the audio-vocal system to detect the source of incoming feedback in order to more effectively detect and control for vocal errors that occur in the feedback of self-produced voices compared with externally-generated feedback.
