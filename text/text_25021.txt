BACKGROUND
lrr  domains are present in over  <dig>   <dig> proteins listed in pfam, prints, smart, interpro and panther databases  <cit> . lrr-containing proteins have been identified in viruses, bacteria, archae, and eukaryotes. most lrr proteins are involved in protein, ligand and in protein, protein interactions; these include plant immune response and the mammalian innate immune response  <cit> .

all lrr units can be divided into a hcs  and a vs . the hcs part consists of an eleven residue stretch, lxxlxlxxnxl, or a twelve residue stretch, lxxlxlxxcxxl, in which "l" is leu, ile, val, or phe, "n" is asn, thr, ser, or cys, and "c" is cys, ser or asn. three residues at positions  <dig> to  <dig> in the highly conserved segments form a short β-strand. the β-strands stack parallel and the multiple lrrs then form an arc. the concave face consists of a parallel β-sheet and the convex face is made of a variety of secondary structures including the a-helix, 310-helix, polyproline ii helix, and an extended structure or a tandem arrangement of β-turns. in most lrr proteins the β-strands on the concave surface and  helical elements on the convex surface are connected by short loops or β-turns. seven classes of lrrs have been recognized, characterized by different lengths and consensus sequences of the vs part of the repeats  <cit> . they are "ri-like", "cc", "bacterial", "sds22-like", "plant specific", "typical", and "tplrr" <cit> . the seven classes of lrr domains adopt a variety of structures.

"typical" lrrs are the most abundant lrr class. the consensus sequence is lxxlxlxxnxlxxlpxxofxxlxx. the repeat length is 20- <dig> residues. bold uppercase letters indicate more than 70% occurrence of a given residue in a certain position; normal letters indicate 40-70% occurrence and lowercase letters indicate 30-40% occurrence; "o" indicates a non-polar residue, and "x" indicates nonconserved residues. their variable segments adopt mainly polyproline ii plus β-turn, consecutive β-turns or β-turn plus polyproline ii in the convex faces; the structural units may be represented by β - . "ri-like" lrrs are contained in proteins such as ribonuclease inhibitor and ran gtpase activating protein. the consensus sequence is lxxlxlxxnxxxxgoxxlxxolxxxxx. the repeat length is 28- <dig>  their vss mainly adopt α-helix . cysteine-containing  lrr proteins include grr <dig> proteins from saccharomyces cerevisiae. the consensus sequence is lxxlxlxxcxxitdxxoxxlxxxx. the repeat length is 25- <dig>  their vss mainly adopt α-helix . a gala-lrr is a subclass of cc-lrr; its consensus sequence is lxxlxlxxnxigdxaxxlaxxx of  <dig> residues  <cit> . plant-specific  lrr proteins include pgip and cf- <dig> . the consensus sequence is lxxlxlxxnxlgxipxxlgxlxx. the repeat length is 23- <dig>  the vss mainly adopt  <dig> - helix. also in individual lrrs the β-strand on the concave face at the n-terminus and the  <dig> - helix on the convex face at the c-terminus is connected by a β-turn; the structural units are β - . "sds22-like" lrrs are included in sds <dig> and internalins. the consensus sequence is lxxlxlxxniielexlxx. the repeat length is 21- <dig>  the structural units of individual repeats are β -  <dig>  "bacterial" lrrs are found in yopm from yersinia pestis, and ipah from shigella flexneri. the consensus sequence is lxxlxvxxnxlxxlplpxx. the repeat length is 20- <dig>  the structural units are β - pii. "tplrr" are found in treponema pallidum lrr protein and in bacteroides forsythus surface antigen. the consensus sequence is lxxlxlxxxlxxigxxafxxxx. the repeat length is 23- <dig>  the dominant feature is a highly conserved segment of ten residues, differing from the corresponding eleven residues of other lrrs. the structure of this class remains unknown.

most of the known lrr structures have a cap, which shields the hydrophobic core of the first unit of lrr domain at the n-terminus and/or the last unit at the c-terminus. in extracellular proteins or extracellular regions, these caps frequently consist of cys clusters including two or four cys residues; the cys clusters on the n- and c-terminal sides of the lrr arcs are called lrrnt and lrrct, respectively  <cit> . non-lrr, island regions interrupting lrrs are widely distributed. island regions are observed in many lrr proteins including plant lrr-rlks, plant lrr-rlps, insect toll and toll-related proteins, slit proteins, fungi adenylate cyclases, and leishmania proteophosphoglycans  <cit> .

the evolution of lrrs is not well understood. it is not even known whether all lrr's share a common ancestor. kobe and deisenhofer  <cit>  pointed out the possibility of their having been at least a few independent occurrences of lrrs. kajava  <cit>  also suggested separate origins for several different classes of lrrs based on the high levels of conservation within each lrr class. in contrast, andrade et al.,  <cit>  found that searches by a homology-based method, rep, could not absolutely partition lrrs into these separate classes and thus they suggested that these proteins have a common origin, rather than separate origins as proposed by kajava.

duplication and recombination as a mechanism of the evolution of the disease resistance gene  from various plant species has been proposed by many investigators  <cit> . distinct higher-order repeating units of lrr's occur in a group of lrr proteins including ribonuclease inhibitor, the subfamily of small leucine-rich repeat proteoglycan , and the subfamily of toll-like receptors   <cit> . an evolutionary model has been proposed that involves duplication of the higher-order lrr repeating units  <cit> . moreover, the possibility of horizontal gene transfer  has been discussed  <cit> .

escherichia coli yddk is  <dig> residues long and contains  <dig> tandem repeats of lrrs; six of the  <dig> repeats have the consensus of lxxlxlxxnxlxxlxlxxxxx with  <dig> residues . the variable segment differs significantly from those of the above seven classes. the purpose of this paper is to investigate the occurrence of this novel domains. we identified many lrr proteins having the novel domain  and analyzed their sequences. we discuss the evolution and structure of "irreko" lrr.

RESULTS
proteins having irreko@lrrs
we identified a total of  <dig> irreko@lrr proteins from  <dig> bacterial species including escherichia, shigella, vibrio, shewanella, photobacterium, bifidobacterium, porphyromonas, treponema, listeria, alistipes, bacteroides, clostridium, cytophaga, and flavobacterium . a group of these proteins contain a signal peptide , indicating that they are extracellular. the others lack both a signal peptide and a transmembrane helix, indicating that they are intracellular.

some extracellular irreko@lrr proteins contain cys clusters on the n-terminal side of the irreko@lrr domain ; while lrrct is not observed. for examples, irreko@lrr proteins from vibrio, shewanella, and photobacterium have an lrrnt with the pattern of cx16c . three vibrio irreko@lrr proteins  have an lrrnt of cx20c. cysteine in the first lrr sometimes participates in lrrnt .

some irreko@lrr proteins have non-lrr, island regions interrupting lrrs . they include kaot1_ <dig> from kordia algicida ot- <dig>  cps_ <dig> from vibrio psychroerythus, fjoh_1188/fjohdraft_ <dig> and fjoh_1189/fjohdraft_ <dig> from flavobacterium johnsoniae, cbac1_ <dig> from clostridiale bacterium 1_7_47_faa, scb49_ <dig> from unidentified eubacterium, aliput_ <dig> from alistipes putredinis, and faepram212_ <dig> from faecalibacterium prausnitzii m21/ <dig> 

there is a single example of an "irreko" domain from a eukaryote and a single example from a virus. the eukaryote protein is tvag_ <dig> from trichomonas vaginalis g <dig> . tvag_ <dig> contains  <dig> lrrs. two of the  <dig> repeats are clearly "irreko" domains. the virus protein is msv <dig> from melanoplus sanguinipes entomopoxvirus . this protein contains  <dig> lrrs with the consensus of lkyldcsnnxlxnlxinn . the repeating unit length is  <dig> residues and thus shorter than that of typical "irreko" lrr.

two subtypes of irreko@lrr domains
irreko@lrrs that are  <dig> residues long may be classified into two subtypes . the first subtype has the consensus of lxxlxlxxnxlxxldlxxxx, while the second has the consensus of lxxlxcxxnxlxxldlxxxx, where "l" is leu, val, ile, phe, met or ala, "n " is asn, thr or ser, "d" is asp or asn, "q" is gln, and "x" is nonconserved residues. as well as the other seven classes, "x" is generally hydrophilic or neutral residues .

in these two subgroups, "l" at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> is predominantly leu, while "l" or "c" at position  <dig> is not only leu or cys but also val or ile, and frequently ala and phe. "n" at position  <dig> is predominantly asn and often thr, ser or cys. "d" at position  <dig> is predominantly occupied by asp and frequently by asn. position  <dig> is often occupied by leu, asn, or gln. some irreko@lrr proteins such as listeria internalin-j homologs and four bacteroides proteins include lrrs in which the hcs part consists of a twelve residue stretch, lxxlxlxxxxl as lrrs with  <dig> or  <dig> residues sometimes keep the most conserved segments of lx in both hcs and vs parts, we regard those as irreko@lrr.

irreko@lrr domains that mainly consist of the first subtype are observed in  <dig> proteins . some proteins have the consensus of lxxlxlxxnxlxxldlxxnxx. these include biflac_ <dig> and bla_ <dig> from bifidobacterium animalis, a1q_ <dig>  vas14_ <dig>  vas14_ <dig>  and cps_ <dig> from vibrio species, swoodraft_ <dig>  swoodraft_ <dig>  and shal_ <dig> from shewanella species, and ska34_ <dig> and ska34_ <dig> from photobacterium sp. ska <dig> . also, the consensus of lxxlxlxxnxlxxldlxxlxx is observed in a few proteins including scb49_ <dig> from unidentified eubacterium scb <dig> . the pattern of lxxlxlxxnxlxxldlxxqxx is observed in only cps_ <dig> from vibrio psychroerythus .

irreko@lrr domains that consist mainly of the second subtype are observed in  <dig> proteins . the consensus of lxxlxcxxnxlxxldlxxnxx in which "l" at position  <dig> is more frequently occupied by val or ile than by leu is observed in some proteins. they include listeria lmo <dig> homologs, chu_ <dig> from cytophaga hutchinsonii and porue0001_ <dig> from porphyromonas uenonis 60- <dig> . also, the pattern of lxxlxcxxnxlxxldlxxlxx is observed in tde_ <dig>  tde_ <dig>  and tde_ <dig> from treponema denticola . moreover, the pattern of lxxlxcxxnxlxxldlxxvxx is observed in pnap_ <dig> from polaromonas naphthalenivorans and mlddraft_ <dig> from delta proteobacterium mlms- <dig> .

the coexistence of the first and the second subtypes is observed in the lrr domains in at least six irreko@lrr proteins. they include kaot1_ <dig> from kordia algicida ot- <dig>  copeut_ <dig> from coprococcus eutactus atcc  <dig>  fjoh_1188/fjohdraft_ <dig> and fjoh_1189/fjohdraft_ <dig> from flavobacterium johnsoniae, rumgna_ <dig> from ruminococcus gnavus atcc  <dig>  dorfor_ <dig> from dorea formicigenerans atcc  <dig>  and internain-j homologs from eleven listeria monocytogenes strains .

nested periodicity of irreko@lrrs
irreko@lrrs show a characteristic, nested periodicity; the domains consist of alternating 10- and 11- residue units of lxxlxlxxnx. to confirm this periodic nesting we performed detailed sequence analysis of irreko@lrr proteins using dot plots analysis and a radar chart analysis.

self dot plots were performed for four irreco@lrr proteins - biflac_ <dig> from bifidobacterium animalis, a1q_ <dig> from vibrio harveyi hy <dig>  lmo <dig> protein from listeria monocytogenes and an internalin-related protein, tde_ <dig>  from treponema denticola - . the self dot plots indicate that these proteins demonstrate tandem repeats of short residues that is ~10- <dig> residues long, in addition to tandem repeats of irreco@lrr with  <dig> residues.

radar charts were drawn for three families of irreko@lrrs proteins, in which the occurrence frequency of amino acids is compared between positions 1- <dig> and positions 11- <dig>  figure 2a shows a radar chart of vibrio proteins. seven vibrio species encode twelve irreko@lrr proteins which are potential homologs . the irreko@lrrs domains in their proteins contain  <dig> lrr repeats. one hundred thirty-seven of the  <dig> repeats are complete "irreko" domains with  <dig> residues. the radar chart of the  <dig> lrrs is shown in figure  <dig>  as expected, "l" at positions  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> is highly conserved with positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. in addition, a significant, weak conservation is observed between positions  <dig> and  <dig> but not  <dig>  because amino acid distribution of positions  <dig> and  <dig> is very similar and are relatively rich in lys, asn and gln. alsor, positions  <dig> and  <dig> show a conservation in which the amino acids are relatively rich ser, thr, asp and glu. moreover, positions  <dig> and  <dig> show a weak conservation at which those are relatively rich in ser and thr.

similarly, in addition to high conservation of positions of 1- <dig>  4- <dig>  and 6- <dig>  a weak conservation among even "x" positions occupied by non-conserved residues is also observed in irreko@lrrs within nine, potential homologs from four shewanella species; positions 2- <dig>  3- <dig>  and 7- <dig> are relatively rich in thr and ser, and in those within four, potential homologs from two photobacterium species; positions 3- <dig> are relatively rich in thr, ser, asp and glu, and positions 7- <dig> are relatively rich in ser and thr, and positions 10- <dig> are relatively rich in gln and lys .

the analyses of both dot plots analysis and radar chart demonstrate that irreko@lrrs show a nested periodicity consisting of alternating 10- and 11- residue units with the consensus of lxxlxlxxnx.

secondary structure prediction
the protein secondary structure prediction of irreko@lrr proteins was performed . e. coli yddk contains  <dig> lrrs . proteus and sspro <dig>   <cit>  predict that  <dig> of the  <dig> lrrs prefer β-strands at positions  <dig> through  <dig> and/or its neighboring positions in the hcs part; although only the eighth lrr does not prefer β-strand, its hcs part - vtyfsaahnql- is clearly a canonical lrr. similarly, all or most lrrs in other proteins prefer β-strands at the corresponding positions in the hcs part.

both methods of secondary structure prediction indicate that residues at positions  <dig> through  <dig> and/or its neighboring positions prefer coil conformations in most lrrs of e. coli yddk, listeria lmo <dig> protein, and treponema tde_ <dig>  on the other hand, in most lrrs of bifidobacterium biflac_ <dig>  vibrio a1q_ <dig> and shewanella swoodraft_ <dig>  residues at the corresponding positions prefer β-strands. it is concluded that individual three residues at positions  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig> could form a short β-strand.

occurrence of "sds22-like" and "bacterial" lrr domains within irreko@lrr domains
the first lrr of lrr domain in a large number of irreko@lrr proteins are an "sds22-like" domain, lxxlxlxxnxlxxlxxlxxlxx; even though "n" at position  <dig> is sometimes occupied by lys, gln or leu   <cit> . their proteins include eleven proteins from seven vibrio species, eight proteins from five shewanella species, eleven internalin-j homologs from eleven listeria monocytogenes strains, nine lmo <dig> homologs from eight l. monocytogenes strains and l. innocua, and nine proteins from three flavobacterium species.

"sds22-like" lrr occurs even in the middle position in the irreko@lrr domains in some proteins. cbac1_ <dig> from clostridiale bacterium 1_7_47_faa with  <dig>  residues contains  <dig> tandem repeats of lrrs; one non-lrr, island region is observed between the seventh and eighth lrrs . twelve of the  <dig> repeats are "irreko" domain with 20- <dig> residues. on the other hand, the remaining  belong to "sds22-like" class with the consensus is lxxlxcxxnxlxxlxxlxxlxx.

the three listeria lin <dig> homologs - lmof6854_ <dig>  lmoh7858_ <dig>  and lmof2365_ <dig> - have 993- <dig>  residues and contain  <dig> tandem repeats of lrrs . six of the  <dig> repeats are "irreko" domain, while eight repeats are "sds22-like" class.

other examples include fb2170_ <dig> from flavobacteriale bacterium htcc <dig> and three proteins - bacova_ <dig> from bacteroides ovatus, baccac_ <dig> from bacteroides caccae atcc  <dig>  and bacfin_ <dig> from bacteroides finegoldii dsm  <dig> - that are homologous to each other . the former contains nine tandem repeats of lrrs and the third lrr of lvlveilanelhtikglskmtq is an "sds22-like" class. the latter three proteins contains eight tandem repeats of lrrs. the fifth lrr is iailigcafqsldilccps and thus appears to be a "sds22-like" domain.

five ecumm_ <dig> homologs from three escherichia coli strains and two shigella species contain 11- <dig> tandem repeats of lrrs . three ecs2075/z <dig> homologs from several escherichia coli strains and two shigella strains contain four or five tandem repeats of lrrs . the first lrr are all masldlsyldlselppipst and thus belongs to "bacterial" class with the consensus of lxxlxlxxnxlxxlpxlpxx   <cit> . three ecumm_ <dig> homologs occur in three e. coli strains with  <dig> repeats of irreko@lrr. the first lrr is qndidlsglnl tqppglqn. it may belong to "bacterial" lrr.

discussion
irreko@lrr as new class of lrr
the present observations indicate that irreko@lrr is a new class of lrr. this is supported by several additional observations. the identification of lrrs by pfam or smart occurs in a large number of irreko@lrr proteins including e. coli yddk; this results from the significant similarity of their hcss with those of the other lrr classes. there are many lrr proteins that contain the lrr domain consisting mainly of "sds22-like" domain. the "sds22-like" lrrs in listeria lin1204/lmof6854_ <dig> and microcoleus chthonoplastes pcc  <dig> mc7420_ <dig>  also have some irreko@lrr domains.

evolution
the irreko@lrrs show a nested periodicity consisting of alternating 10- and 11- residue units with the consensus of lxxxlxxnx. the irreko@lrr domains in many proteins contain a mixture of both subtypes. the first lrr of the lrr domains is frequently "sds22-like" or "bacterial" classes. in addition, among the irreko@lrr domain "sds22-like" class occurs in some proteins. the two subtypes of irreko@lrr appear to have evolved from a common precursor. further, the "irreko" domain evolved from a precursor common to "sds22-like" and "bacterial" classes. the precursor of irreko@lrr is shorter sequence - lxxlxlxxnx -. this parsimonious evolutionary scenario for three lrr classes, "irreko", "sds22-like", and "bacterial" lrrs is shown in figure  <dig> 

previous studies revealed that lrr domains in many lrr proteins contain tandem repeats of a super-domain of stt, where "t" is "typical" lrr and "s" is "bacterial" lrr; they include the slrp subfamily , the tlr <dig> family , the flrt family , and omgp  <cit> . the combination of the previous and the present observations suggest that the four lrr classes of "bacterial", "typical", "sds22-like" and "irreko" might evolve from a common precursor.

structure
the known lrr structures reveal that conserved hydrophobic residues in the consensus contribute to the hydrophobic cores in the lrr arcs  <cit> . as noted, the consensus of irreko@lrr is lxxlxlxxnxlxxldlxxxx or lxxlxcxxnxlxxldlxxxx. it is likely that the conserved hydrophobic residues at the six  positions of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  participate in the hydrophobic core .

the lrr structures with α-helices in their convex faces have more pronounced curvature than structures with  <dig> or polyproline ii helices  <cit> . this difference in curvature is attributed to the differences in diameter of the different secondary structure elements on the convex face, α-helices being wider than 310-helices, polyproline ii helices or tandem β-turns. irreko@lrr is predicted to adopt β-β structural units, because individual three residues at positions  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig> could form a short β-strand . β-strands have the smallest diameter. moreover, the loops that link the c-terminal ends of the β-strands in the hcs to the n termini of those in the vs appear to be different from the loops that link the c-terminal ends of those in the vs to the n termini of the following β-strands, as the hcs is one residue longer than the vs. thus, an inferred arc structure of irreko@lrr has a smaller curvature.

position  <dig> in the i-th and the -th repeats of irreko@lrrs is alternatively occupied by positive and negative charged amino acids in some proteins. examples include cdifqcd-2_ <dig> and cdifq_ <dig> from clostridium difficile and chu_ <dig> from cytophaga hutchinsonii, as well as fjohdraft_ <dig> and fjoh_ <dig> from flavobacterium johnsoniae . the inferred arc structure of irreko@lrrs will enable them to form polar hydrogen bond interactions which lead to its structural stability.

it is possible that the β-solenoid structure of irreko@lrrs is related to β-helix proteins  <cit> . a β-β structural unit that is responsible for tandem repeats of ggxgxd is also observed in serralysin  <cit> . the β-solenoids with β-β structural units in irreko@lrr protein and serralysin represent an example of convergent evolution. future studies should resolve this question.

CONCLUSIONS
irreko@lrr is a new, unique class of lrr. irreko@lrr with the consensus of lxxlx xxnxlxxlxlxxxx is a nested sequence consisting of alternating  <dig> - and 11-residue units of lxxlxlxxnx. the irreko@lrr domains frequently coexist with "sds22-like" or "bacterial" lrr. these findings suggest that the ancestor of irreko@lrr is shorter residues of lxxlxlxxnx and that irreko@lrr evolved from a common ancestor with "sds22-like" and "bacterial" classes. irreko@lrrs are predicted to adopt an arc shape with smaller curvature in which individual repeats adopt β-β structural units.
