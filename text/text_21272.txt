BACKGROUND
for over  <dig> million years , cephalopods have been vital members of ecosystems spanning tropical to polar regions  <cit> . cephalopods play an important role as both consumers and prey  <cit>  and there are about  <dig> known extant species  <cit> . despite the fact they are molluscs, cephalopods often directly compete with fishes  <cit> . this is facilitated not only by the possession of a highly developed nervous system but particularly due to their advanced oxygen supply system. the cephalopod oxygen supply system is powered by three hearts, which push blood containing the oxygen carrier haemocyanin through their closed circulatory system .

as ectotherms, cephalopods are required to sustain metabolic performance and thus body functions at their respective habitat temperature. this task seems challenging considering the large temperature variation in temperate climates or the sub-zero temperatures prevailing in polar waters. temperature is known to affect oxygen supply in marine ectotherms and even to cause the failure of oxygen supply at the margins of an animal’s thermal niche  <cit> . this has also been confirmed in cephalopods. in the common cuttlefish, sepia officinalis, blood perfusion failed to fuel the increased metabolic demand for oxygen at higher temperatures  <cit> . at lower temperatures however, recent evidence ascribes haemocyanin a major role in limiting cold tolerance  <cit> . this is because the affinity of haemocyanin for oxygen increases as temperature decreases, an effect which decreases oxygen release to the tissues in sepia officinalis and octopods at lower temperatures. however, the antarctic octopod, pareledone charcoti, was shown to mitigate this detrimental effect by an increased expression of a haemocyanin with lowered affinity for oxygen, and an increased rate of ph dependent oxygen release. this allows haemocyanin of pareledone charcoti to release oxygen at higher ph than haemocyanins from warm water octopods  <cit> .

while much progress has been made in understanding the underlying molecular and evolutionary mechanisms that explain adaptations of blood oxygen transport in polar fishes  <cit> , such mechanisms remain unknown in polar ectotherms, which use haemocyanin as blood oxygen carrier. this is surprising, as cephalopod haemocyanins have been considered among the best understood of the molluscan respiratory proteins for over 20 years . between ~ <dig> - <dig>  mda in size, cephalopod haemocyanins are among the largest known respiratory pigments  <cit> . they form a single cylinder built from ten subunits, each composed of a ‘chain’ of eight  or seven  paralogous functional units  termed as fu a, b, c, d,  e, f, g . in octopods and nautilus, subunits are 350 kda in size, with fu a-f forming the wall structure of the cylindrical haemocyanin decamer and fu g a collar like structure at the inside of the cylinder . every fu binds one dioxygen molecule to a central pair of copper atoms, each of which is coordinated by three histidines, enabling each octopus haemocyanin to carry up to  <dig> oxygen molecules  <cit> . recurring duplication events of one subunit coding gene has led to the presence of two or even three haemocyanin isoforms in cephalopods  <cit> .

despite the well-established structural details it remains unknown how molecular and structural features evolved to enable haemocyanin mediated oxygen supply in cephalopods at temperatures as low as − <dig>  °c. we therefore aimed to 1) assess whether natural selection affected the haemocyanin gene and if so, 2) how selection on particular sites or regions may have affected haemocyanin function and 3) lastly, if this explains mechanisms of cold adaptation previously observed in octopods  <cit> .

in this study we analysed two partial regions of the haemocyanin gene, spanning both wall- and collar-type functional units and compared them among  <dig> species of polar, temperate, subtropical and tropical benthic octopods. in this sequence of  <dig> amino acids, we found  <dig> sites under positive selection  predominantly at the fu surface suggesting functional modifications via indirect charge-charge interactions that stabilize quaternary interaction among fus in cold-adapted octopods. additional analysis of the entire haemocyanin gene of the antarctic octopus pareledone charcoti suggests that these findings apply to other fus as well. the presence of a potential allosteric site in fu g may further support oxygen release in the cold.

RESULTS
phylogenetic analysis
in this study we analysed  <dig> individuals of  <dig> benthic octopods species. new sequences obtained in this study included  <dig> sequences of cytochrome c oxidase subunit i ,  <dig> sequences of cytochrome c oxidase subunit iii  as well as  <dig> partial haemocyanin sequences . coi and coiii have been frequently employed to resolve species relationships among cephalopods elsewhere  and were thus used as a ‘phylogenetic standard’ in comparison to the haemocyanin phylogeny to identify cues of natural selection. phylogenetic relationships resulting from bayesian and maximum likelihood  analyses of coi and coiii sequence data conformed to the most recent classification of octopod families . the analysed antarctic octopods included two families;  <dig> species of the megaleledonidae sampled in sub-antarctic and antarctic waters as well as three species of the enteroctopodidae exclusively sampled in sub-antarctic waters . arctic octopods comprised two species of the bathypolypodidae. non-polar octopods comprised  <dig> species; five temperate species represented in the enteroctopodidae, eledonidae and the octopodidae, three subtropical species represented in the eledonidae and the octopodidae and four tropical species found in the octopodidae only .fig.  <dig> bayesian phylogenetic tree illustrating species and family relationships among the analysed octopods. bayesian analysis was performed on concatenated data sets of the mitochondrial genes cytochrome oxidase subunit i  and cytochrome oxidase subunit iii . colours represent the climatic origin. nodes were labelled with posterior probabilities and maximum likelihood bootstrap support values following a backslash, above a threshold of  <dig>  or  <dig>  respectively. asterisks mark values of  <dig>  identical colours mark octopods of the same climatic origin. sample codes are indicated in brackets.



two separate phylogenies of the haemocyanin gene based on a 1) 858 bp long region spanning fu f to fu g and a 2) 330 bp long region within the fu g  had some important topological differences to the recent octopod classification  <cit> . for the haemocyanin region fu f-g, all octopod families identified with coi and coiii formed distinct clades as well, yet with the eledonidae being a well-supported sister group to the antarctic megaleledonidae , which was not the case in the coi/coiii phylogeny . for the haemocyanin region fu g, neither the antarctic megaleledonidae nor the arctic bathypolypodidae formed monophyletic groups, rather species within these two families were mixed together within a single clade , despite being distinct families in the coi-coiii phylogeny . octopodidae species also did not form a well-supported monophyletic group . the eledonidae and enteroctopodidae remained distinct, with the latter forming a well-supported sister group with the polar megaleledonidae and bathypolypodidae . however, within the coi-coiii phylogeny such relationship could not be resolved with these three clades forming a polytomy .fig.  <dig> schematic illustration of the functional units of the octopus haemocyanin gene and the partial regions analysed in this study. conserved binding sites of the degenerate forward and reverse primers are marked with the corresponding amino acid sequence waiwq or pywdw. resulting amplicons spanned a region between the functional units f and g and a region within the functional unit g. fragment lengths are indicated before  and after sequence trimming .

the analysis retrieved at least two isoforms for most families that, however, were often not easily discernible from allelic variation. most apparently, in the partial haemocyanin region fu g two distinct isoforms were present, contained in both octopods from warm and cold climates that caused a major split of the phylogeny . this was at least partly due to the lack of a five amino acid long region  at positions 2638– <dig>  in the fu g isoform  <dig>  which was most frequent in the bathypolypodidae and the antarctic enteroctopodidae .

natural selection in octopus haemocyanin
the analysed partial haemocyanin regions of fu f-g and fu g spanning the amino acid positions 2306– <dig> were highly conserved, as indicated by the jensen-shannon divergence measure  being  <dig>  on average  and larger than  <dig>  for more than 90 % of positions . particularly sites known to be involved in oxygen binding or protein stability were highly conserved such as the copper binding histidines , disulfide or thioether bridge forming cysteines , or other residues within a 7 Å radius of the active site . pronounced sequence variation was found within the peptide linking the fu f and fu g  as well as at the region flanked by the alpha helix α <dig> and α <dig>  located within a structural fu domain rich in α helices . variation in the latter was mostly explained by the dpekg indel at this position .fig.  <dig>

analysis of the partial haemocyanin regions revealed both negative as well as positive selection. while negative selection removes alleles that are detrimental to protein function and thus ‘purifies’ genes from sequence variability, positive selection increases the frequency of advantageous alleles. negative selection prevailed within the analysed haemocyanin regions as indicated 1) by the high conservation of the haemocyanin genes , 2) predominant negative differences of non-synonymous and synonymous codon substitutions  inferred from single likelihood ancestral counting  as well as 3) by codon based maximum likelihood and bayesian analysis, which identified 26 % of sites being under significant negative selection . in contrast, only  <dig> sites of the analysed  <dig> codons  were identified to be positively selected . amino acid properties being affected at these positively selected sites included the isoelectric point identified by both prime and treesaap analysis, as well as chemical composition , equilibrium constant , alpha helical tendencies and the power to be at the c-terminal .table  <dig> positively selected sites in octopus haemocyanin

structural links to protein function
eleven out of the  <dig> positively selected sites could be mapped onto the published crystal structure of the haemocyanin fu g . seven of these sites were located at the surface of fu g and fu f and only three sites at the inside. one site, located in fu g at position  <dig>  was embedded into a small surface pocket and therefore was neither defined as buried or exposed .fig.  <dig> steric arrangement of positively selected sites in octopus haemocyanin. the 3d model represents the haemocyanin molecule of the functional unit g of enteroctopus dofleini . positively selected sites were marked red and labelled with its residue number. copper ligand histidines were marked blue. due to strong homology, positions of positively selected sites from functional unit f could be mapped onto the fu g 3d structure. 3d structures below illustrate positively selected sites located at the protein surface



the seven positively selected surface residues as well as the residue at position  <dig>  were largely characterized by changes of their side chain charge with either substitutions among polar amino acids as is the case for most sequences at positions  <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  or substitutions between polar and hydrophobic amino acids as is the case for most sequences at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> . the site at position  <dig> was located in the linker region between fu f and fu g and showed the by far highest number of substitution events;  <dig> non-synonymous substitutions, involving alanine, valine, threonine, or serine . changes of polar amino acids also affected the residue at position  <dig> located at the end of fu f, however this residue could not be mapped onto the published haemocyanin crystal structure.

the buried residues at position  <dig> and  <dig> were only two or four residues adjacent to the copper binding histidines his <dig> or his <dig>  respectively . position  <dig> was characterized by its proximity to both the copper binding his <dig> and the fu surface. it was embedded in a surface pocket surrounded by highly conserved neighbours, comprising the hydrophobic pro <dig>  leu <dig>  tyr <dig> and the hydrophilic his <dig> and his <dig> as well as the variable residue  <dig>  which included valine in the fu g isoform  <dig> and polar serine and threonine in the fu g isoform  <dig> . at site  <dig>  three exclusively hydrophobic amino acids were present, methionine, isoleucine or leucine, whose side chains were > 7 Å distant from the closest copper binding histidine  . at position  <dig>  three different amino acids were present across the alignment; threonine, alanine and valine , of which only threonine was able to form polar interaction. the analysis of the structural environment using phymol showed that the only polar neighbour in proximity of the polar -oh group was the terminal amino group of his <dig> , which however, is involved in a peptide bond with arg <dig>  the amino groups of the histidine side chains were too distant for any polar interaction . the third buried residue  <dig> was located within the alpha helix α <dig> and comprised exclusively aliphatic residues, methionine, isoleucine, leucine or valine .

correlates of temperature adaptation
based on the predominant positive selection on charge properties of haemocyanin fu surface residues, we assessed the effect of climate origin of octopods on polar surface residues for each of the two haemocyanin regions. principal component analysis, based on total counts of each polar amino acid type, showed a distinct separation of species from cold and warm climates, with tropical octopods being most distant from antarctic and arctic octopods. sequences of temperate and subtropical octopods overlapped and occurred between those of polar and tropical octopods in the pca plots with respect to their composition of charged amino acids . the antarctic enteroctopodidae, however, did not group with the antarctic megaleledonidae but rather with octopods from warmer climates in  or within a distinct cluster formed by the isoform  <dig> present in fu g .fig.  <dig> principal component analysis for polar surface residues of octopus haemocyanin. the analysis was performed separately a) for  <dig> surface residues of the partial haemocyanin fragment fu f-g and b) for  <dig> surface residues of the partial haemocyanin fragment fu g. surface residues were identified for the haemocyanin structural model  using getarea  <cit> . pca variables comprised the total number of each type of polar surface residue as well as their total net charge. identical colours mark octopods of the same climatic origin. rectangles mark the centroid of the respective climatic group. pca scores were abbreviated with species names as followed: apo adelieledone polymorpha, bar bathypolypus arcticus, blo benthoctopus longibrachus, bpu bathypolypus pugniger, bri benthoctopus rigbyae, bsp benthoctopus sp., cma callistoctopus macropus, cor callistoctopus ornatus, eci eledone cirrhosa, edo enteroctopus dofleini, emo eledone moschata, gya graneledone yamana, hlu hapalochlaena lunulata, hma hapalochlaena maculosa, mma macroctopus maorum, mse megaeledone setebos, ome octopus membranaceus, ovu octopus vulgaris, pae pareledone aequipillae, pau pareledone aurata, pch pareledone charcoti, pco pareledone cornuta, pfe pareledone felix, ppa pareledone panchroma, ppr pareledone prydzensis, ptu pareledone turqueti



the frequency of glutamic acid increased in both haemocyanin regions towards octopods from warmer climates, except for the antarctic enteroctopodidae, and correlated negatively with numbers of positively charged amino acids , which accordingly increased by frequency in octopods from polar climates. numbers of cysteine and tyrosine did not help to explain the divisions between climate origins in both fu regions. the observed pattern also persisted independently of evolutionary relationships. for example, temperate octopods from three distinct families grouped closely together . similarly, arctic octopods grouped within the antarctic megaleledonidae despite these being well understood to be distinct families . due to the climate dependent trend of acidic or basic surface residues, the net charge of surface residues was highly correlated with climate in fu f-g , however not in fu g . the lack of correlation in fu g was due to the differing surface charge properties between the two distinct isoforms present in fu g . when analysed separately, isoform  <dig> conformed to the high correlation between climate origin and net charge , yet not isoform  <dig>  which showed a slightly positive trend between climate origin and net charge . separation between the two isoforms in fu g was mostly determined by a higher histidine and lower arginine content in isoform  <dig> . the analysis of entire haemocyanin sequences showed a more positive net surface charge across all fus except fu a in the antarctic octopus pareledone charcoti compared to the temperate giant pacific octopus enteroctopus dofleini , which confirms findings for the partial regions fu f-g and fu g . charge differences were due to both increasing numbers of positively charged and decreasing numbers of negatively charged amino acids .fig.  <dig> net surface charges for haemocyanin fu a-g compared between the temperate north-pacific octopus enteroctopus dofleini and the antarctic octopus pareledone charcoti. maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree based on the amino acid alignment of fu a-g of both species. support values calculated from  <dig> bootstrap replicates are given above nodes if larger than  <dig>  asterisks indicate values of  <dig>  total net charge and numbers of charged residues were calculated from  <dig> surface residues of each fu and presented in detail



moreover, residue  <dig> varied between the three hydrophobic amino acids, of which methionine prevailed in polar octopods and leucine in tropical octopods. of the  <dig> haemocyanin sequences from polar octopods 88 % contained methionine, 12 % isoleucine and 0 % leucine. in contrast, of the  <dig> haemocyanin sequences from tropical octopods, three sequences contained methionine , none contained isoleucine and ten sequences contained leucine . subtropical and temperate octopods showed a mixed pattern for these amino acids . lastly, although residue  <dig> was highly positively selected, there was no correlation with climatic origin .

discussion
natural selection in octopus haemocyanin
mollusc haemocyanin evolved from a α-subclass tyrosinase some  <dig> million years ago  <cit>  and has evolved independently of arthropod haemocyanin since this time  <cit> . cephalopod haemocyanin emerged about  <dig> million years ago  <cit>  with modern coleoid cephalopods  separating from the ancient and sluggish nautiloids around  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . since this time, the haemocyanin of coleoid cephalopods has evolved to keep pace with the increased metabolic demands imposed by an increasingly competitive environment, particularly since the emergence of the faster moving fishes . given the several hundreds of millions of years of evolutionary history, it is thus not surprising that the cephalopod haemocyanin gene underwent extensive purifying selection  leading to widespread sequence conservation as has been confirmed for enteroctopus dofleini  <cit> . high conservation of sites being directly involved in oxygen binding - such as the copper binding centre - indicate rather indirect mechanisms modulating oxygen binding in octopods.

nevertheless, comparisons of two partial haemocyanin regions among octopods from various climates revealed evidence for natural selection acting on the octopus haemocyanin gene. this is indicated by phylogenetic deviations between the mitochondrial genes and the two investigated haemocyanin regions  and also by the presence of variable sites within otherwise highly conserved regions , and lastly pinpointed by sites with increased rates of non-synonymous substitutions confirmed by various selection tests . unfortunately, studies assessing positive selection in mollusc haemocyanins are lacking and at least scarce in other groups. positive selection was reported for lobster haemocyanins due to high non-synonymous substitution rates estimated for whole sequence regions in some species  <cit> , however analysis of single codon sites failed to confirm these findings  <cit> . this first report of positive selection in cephalopod haemocyanin indicates the presence of sites potentially involved in functional adaptation of haemocyanin.

structural links to protein function
although octopus haemocyanin contains sites identified to be positively selected one needs to assess their functional relevance. we thus analysed all  <dig> selected sites for their structural properties to deduce potential functional effects.

our analyses showed that selection prevailed on residues located at the surface of the haemocyanin fu g and fu f, mostly affecting polar/charged properties , suggesting functional relevance for tertiary or quaternary interactions. polar and particularly charged surface residues play a major role in stabilizing contacts among functional units of cephalopod haemocyanin via salt bridges  <cit> . further, cooperativity, often found to be pronounced in cephalopods  <cit> , has been proposed to operate via various interfaces among all seven fu types  <cit> . the partial regions analysed in this study are part of fu f and fu g, which interact with other fu via various surface interfaces. these comprise the closely spaced morphological unit interface fu c↔f, the horizontal tier interface fu e↔f and the arc wall interface fu g1/g2↔d as well as the more distant major groove interface fu a↔f and the arc morphological unit interface fu g1↔g <dig> characterized by weaker interactions  <cit> . based on the detailed interface models of nautilus haemocyanin  <cit> , contact residues for the morphological unit interface fu c↔f were identified as f <dig>  2428whfdrt <dig> and p <dig> for the octopod haemocyanin sequences analysed in this study . interestingly, this region did not contain any of the variable and positively selected sites, and in fact, was highly conserved across all  <dig> sequences . therefore, the morphological unit interface fu c↔f seems a less likely target for direct functional regulation, although significant sequence differences of haemocyanins between octopods and nautilus suggest further or different contact regions at this interface than proposed for nautilus haemocyanin only. contact residues for the alternative interfaces fu e↔f , fu g1/g2↔d, fu a↔f and fu g1↔g <dig> were located outside the analysed sequence region and remain to be assessed in subsequent studies.

only three buried residues were identified to be positively selected, out of which residue  <dig> has high potential to be an allosteric site. this is due to its linking position between the copper binding histidine  and the nearby fu surface as well as its immediate neighbourhood composed of hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids. these create a hydrophobic/hydrophilic contrast, which promotes metal binding, particularly in the presence of the sulphur carrying methionine . a conformational movement of residue  <dig> upon allosteric binding could easily transfer to the two amino acid distant copper binding his <dig> and affect oxygen binding, as minor shifts of only  <dig>  Å between the coordinated copper ions suffice to change oxygenation  <cit> .

the remaining positively selected buried residues  <dig> and  <dig> are less likely to be involved in functional regulation. despite the proximity of site  <dig> to the copper binding his <dig>  neither alanine, valine nor threonine had the possibility to interact directly with the active site. alanine and valine are very non-reactive  <cit>  and were too distant to affect the active site. direct polar interaction of threonine was also unlikely, as the only nearby polar group, the terminal amino group of his <dig>  was involved in a covalent peptide bond. moreover, inward facing residues involved at site  <dig> were exclusively hydrophobic , non-reactive and due to their large distance to the active site unlikely to be involved in functional regulation.

although variation and positive selection were most significant at site  <dig> , functional relevance is rather unlikely. site  <dig> is located at the beginning of the linker region connecting fu f and fu g1/g <dig> that, like all inter-fu linkers, comprise a long , drawn-out sequence between 12– <dig> amino acids  <cit> . given this high length and the capacity to extend further, as linkers are unlikely to extend to their maximum length  <cit> , there is little chance that the identified substitutions among alanine, valine, threonine, or serine  affect the positioning or conformation of the ca. 51 Å distant fu g1/g <dig> 

correlates of temperature adaptation
temperature affects oxygen supply  <cit> , a challenge that octopods have been required to overcome in order to colonize oceans from the tropics to the poles, where they now thrive at high diversity and abundance  <cit> . low temperatures increase the affinity of haemocyanin for oxygen  <cit> , thus hampering oxygen release to the tissue, to an extent that it limits oxygen supply in cephalopods  <cit> . on the other hand, lower temperatures increase levels of physically dissolved oxygen in the blood/haemolymph  <cit>  and decrease mass specific metabolic demands for oxygen of ectothermic animals , which enabled a reduction or even a complete loss of haemoglobin in antarctic notothenioid fishes  <cit> . antarctic octopods similarly benefit from relaxed oxygen requirements in the cold  h− <dig> at 0 °c in the antarctic pareledone charcoti vs.  <dig>  mmol o <dig> kg− <dig> at 21 °c in the subtropical octopus vulgaris  <cit>  and dissolved oxygen contributing  <dig>  % to total haemolymph oxygen content in pareledone charcoti  <cit> ). nevertheless, antarctic octopods continue to rely on active oxygen transport. this is marked by 39 % to 46 % higher concentrations of haemocyanin in the haemolymph and functional modifications of haemocyanin comprising a lower affinity for oxygen, increased rates of ph dependent oxygen release as well as a shift of the ph sensitive range of oxygen binding towards higher ph values compared to octopods from warmer waters  <cit> .

so far, our data has highlighted positive selection acting on surface charges and a potential allosteric site. we thus assessed whether this explains differences among octopods from polar, temperate, subtropical or tropical climates and in particular the functional adaptations observed in cold-adapted antarctic octopods  <cit> . the analysis of polar surface residues revealed a clear distinction between cold and warm adapted octopods dominated by a decrease of glutamic acid and an increase of positively charged amino acids towards colder climates, causing a higher net surface charge in polar octopods compared to octopods from warmer waters . importantly, the comparison between the antarctic octopus pareledone charcoti and the temperate enteroctopus dofleini revealed that this pattern not only applies to the partial regions fu f-g and fu g but also to most of the entire haemocyanin gene . this indicates that climate dependent selection of surface charge properties occurred in parallel for several fus, although full haemocyanin sequences of more and particularly tropical species need to be included to further substantiate these findings.

changes of net surface charge properties help to explain how cold-adapted octopods attenuate the detrimental effect of increased oxygen affinity. perutz  <cit>  provided the first structural explanation for altered oxygen affinity in haemoglobin, based on a his-asp salt bridge linking two haemoglobin subunits. high ambient ph deprotonates the histidine and disrupt this salt bridge, which destabilizes or dilates the haemoglobin quaternary structure and thus increases oxygen affinity by adjacent subunits. haemocyanin may respond similarly. it not only dissociates into its subunits at higher ph  <cit>  but is also highly ph sensitive with bohr coefficients well below − <dig>  <cit> . further, unlike intracellular haemoglobin  <cit> , haemocyanin is not protected from changes of haemolymph ph. consequently, one would expect even larger effects of ph disturbances on haemocyanin structure than on haemoglobin. octopods living in polar waters face higher haemolymph ph than warm water species due to the temperature dependency of equilibrium constants  of ionisable groups, particularly the imidazole groups of proteins . such high haemolymph ph contributes to increased oxygen affinity and to the observed impairment of venous oxygen release towards colder temperatures  <cit> . as a result, an increase of oxygen affinity in response to a cold-induced ph increase may be reduced or prevented if haemocyanin quaternary structure remains stable despite higher ph. the disruption of salt bridges linking haemocyanin fus upon ph changes, as they occur during temperature changes, depends on the pk values of their ionisable groups, which are not fixed but variable depending on their protein environment  <cit> . charge-charge interactions at the protein surface are among the most important factors disturbing the pk of ionisable groups, as evidenced by increased numbers of positively charged lysine, which raise the pk value of several surface residues, by up to  <dig>  units  <cit> . experimental substitutions from glutamic acid to lysine also confirmed increased stability  due to charge-charge interactions at the surface of ribonuclease t <dig>  <cit> . therefore, considering a more positive net surface charge in polar octopods, due to increased numbers of positively charged amino acids and decreased numbers of the negatively charged glutamic acid , charge-charge interactions are likely to raise pk of residues linking fu interfaces. consequently, salt bridges withstand disturbance by high ph occurring at low temperatures and retain the stability of the haemocyanin quaternary structure and accordingly the affinity for oxygen. this is in good agreement with oxygen binding in the antarctic octopod pareledone charcoti, which showed a lower oxygen affinity than the subtropical octopod eledone moschata at the same ph and temperature . this compensation of oxygen affinity was particularly due to a shift of the ph dependent oxygen binding range in pareledone charcoti towards higher ph . theoretical buffer lines of surface residues of the partial haemocyanin sequence fu f-g confirm the more positive net surface charge in pareledone charcoti compared to eledone moschata at a venous ph of  <dig>  . altered surface charge properties were also suggested to facilitate oxygen secretion of haemoglobin  via a decrease of non-conserved histidine residues, which lower the capacity to buffer ph  <cit> . similarly, myoglobin underwent changes of net surface charge to increase oxygen storage capacity in diving mammals via increased electrostatic repulsion, which reduces self-association of myoglobin  <cit> . however, unlike gastropod haemocyanin  <cit> , cephalopod haemocyanin does not assemble to multi-decameric complexes  <cit> . thus electrostatic interactions likely occur intrinsically among the haemocyanin fus.fig.  <dig> functional and structural ph dependence. a ph change of octopod haemolymph following an imidazole like alpha stat pattern of − <dig>  ph units / °c  b) differences between the antarctic pareledone charcoti  and the mediterranean eledone moschata  regarding ph dependent oxygen binding at 10 °c and 1kpa po <dig>  and c) net surface charge of the partial haemocyanin region fu f-g at ph  <dig>  based on six partial haemocyanin sequences for each species, whose buffer lines partly overlap. the dashed vertical line indicates the venous ph at 10 °c interpolated from a)



further, the proposed charge-charge interactions at the surface of fu g and fu f modulate oxygen binding rather via indirect modifications. this is underpinned by the high conservation of the morphological unit interface fu c↔f and the more uniform distribution of positively selected residues at the protein surface.

the presence of two very distinct isoforms in fu g, which does not follow the observed correlation between net surface charge and climatic origin, also supports the view of functionally divergent isoforms that are regulated via differential expression to enable flexible responses to changing environmental or metabolic conditions  <cit> . indeed, native page gel electrophoresis showed differential expression of haemocyanin isoforms in the antarctic squid moroteuthis ingens . however, this could not be documented for octopod haemocyanin so far as their isoforms rarely separate on native gels, except for the antarctic octopod pareledone turqueti, which showed a relatively even expression between two distinct haemocyanin isoforms . similarly, in the cuttlefish sepia officinalis isoforms levels of haemocyanin mrna do not differ in adult specimens or in response to temperature or hypercapnia and change only during ontogeny  <cit> . therefore it remains unclear if octopods employ differential haemocyanin expression to modulate oxygen binding and if polar octopods express their “high net surface charge” isoform of fu g  at significant levels to modulate oxygen binding.

distinct evolutionary histories of the two antarctic octopod families may explain why the enteroctopodidae did not share the same pattern of charged surface residues as the megaleledonidae . the megaleledonidae are thought to have had their evolutionary origins in antarctica before the onset of glaciation around 50 ma years ago  <cit>  whereas the enteroctopodidae are thought to have had their evolutionary origins in shallow northern hemisphere waters from where they moved in to the deep sea and subsequently to antarctic waters  <cit> . therefore, enteroctopodidae may have followed a diverging strategy to cope with cold temperatures either marked by a total lack of compensation or via physiological adjustments that did not involve haemocyanin. such alternative adjustments may comprise increased blood circulation or ventilation, as indicated in benthoctopus spp.  that shows higher metabolic enzyme activities in mantle muscle than graneledone boreopacificus , which shares the same deep sea habitat  <cit> .

moreover, residue  <dig> has the potential as an allosteric site and interestingly contained mostly methionine in polar octopods and mostly leucine in tropical octopods. the sulphur group of methionine plays an important role in coordinating cations such as copper ions in other “blue” proteins such as plastocyanins or azurins  <cit>  as well as in copper trafficking protein  <cit> . in fungal laccases, substitution of methionine with non-coordinating leucine or phenylalanine breaks a copper-methionine interaction, likely leading to significant changes of the redox potential at this site  <cit> . experimental substitution of methionine with norleucine further confirmed specific binding of copper by the sulphur group of methionine  <cit> . although methionine was most frequently found to bind copper, it is also able to form stable complexes with magnesium  <cit> , indicating a general affinity for divalent cations. therefore, a hydrophilic/hydrophobic contrast  <cit>  together with a selective preference of methionine in polar and leucine in warm water octopods at site  <dig> may serve to regulate oxygen affinity in response to temperature adaptation via altered affinity to allosteric metals. such intrinsic regulation would provide a reasonable mechanism to exploit for example magnesium as oxygen affinity regulator despite the octopods’ inability to regulate extracellular magnesium concentrations  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study provided the first insights into molecular and structural mechanisms that enabled octopods to sustain oxygen supply at sub-zero temperatures. in particular, we revealed natural selection acting on two partial gene regions of the octopods’ oxygen transporter haemocyanin. predominant selection of charge properties at the surface of haemocyanin fu g and fu f as well as a more positive net surface charge of the entire haemocyanin gene of the antarctic octopus pareledone charcoti indicated modulation of oxygen binding behaviour via charge-charge interaction. a more positive net surface charge in cold-adapted octopods is suggested to stabilize quaternary structure to sustain a lower oxygen affinity under a high ph environment. selection of a residue linking the surface with the active site further indicates modulation of oxygen affinity via increased sensitivity to allosteric metal binding in cold-adapted octopods. given the high conservation of numerous functional sites being directly involved in oxygen binding or quaternary interactions, modulation of oxygen binding in octopods may prevail on indirect mechanisms such as altered surface charge properties.

future studies may further assess the mechanisms pinpointed in this study by means of obtaining entire haemocyanin sequences from more species to enable comparative modelling of quaternary interactions, ideally complemented by combined functional and mutational experiments on haemocyanin.
