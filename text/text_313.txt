BACKGROUND
there is a considerable body of evidence that reproductive organ size contributes to male reproductive success. this mainly derives from interspecific comparisons that have found positive relationships between testis size and the risk of sperm competition  <cit> . in addition, the direct manipulation of sperm competition intensity under experimental evolution has been shown to cause correlated changes in testes size in two species of diptera  <cit> . however, few studies have addressed the importance of internal reproductive organ size to other components of male reproductive success, or the significance of size variation in accessory reproductive organs which are often vital for sperm transfer, fertility, and essential for success in sperm competition  <cit> .

in this paper, we investigate how reproductive organ size may limit male mating frequency under conditions where males encounter high numbers of mating opportunities and are thus potentially at risk of sperm or seminal fluid depletion  <cit> . previous data support the hypothesis that male mating frequency can be limited by reproductive organ size in insects. for example, in dung flies, the length of the proximal section of the testis decreases with the number of copulations achieved in scathophaga stercoraria  <cit>  and increasing copula duration in sepsis cynipsea  <cit> . testis mass is also lower in mated than in unmated dawson's burrowing bees amegilla dawsoni  <cit> . in contrast, accessory gland size, but not testis size, is phenotypically correlated with male mating frequency in drosophila melanogaster  <cit>  and accessory glands become completely depleted and reduced in volume after 4– <dig> matings, leading to decreased fertility even though motile sperm remain in the seminal vesicles  <cit> . the ability to replenish reserves of sperm and seminal fluid likely further constrains male mating frequency . mating stimulates the replenishment of accessory gland products in d. melanogaster  <cit> . this resynthesis reaches a maximum after 2– <dig> hours and decreases to basal levels after  <dig> hours in drosophila funebris  <cit> .

in this study, we used the stalk-eyed fly cyrtodiopsis dalmanni to test whether testis and accessory gland size are affected by mating. this is an ideal species, as males and females regularly mate at extremely high frequency  <cit> . over 90% of matings occur in nocturnal aggregations which usually consist of a single male and a harem of several females  <cit>  . females join aggregations each evening and mate in the period immediately following dawn before dispersing  <cit> . during copulation, males transfer a single small spermatophore composed of sperm from the testes enveloped in accessory gland secretions  <cit> . previous work has shown that accessory gland length, but not testis length, is phenotypically correlated with male mating frequency  <cit> . additionally, bidirectional artificial selection on male mating frequency resulted in a correlated response in accessory gland length but not in testis length  <cit> . while correlative evidence, whether phenotypic or genetic, indicates an association between accessory gland size and male mating frequency, it does not establish a direct physiological relationship between these two variables. in the current study, we provide direct evidence that mating induces a decrease in accessory gland, but not testis, size. furthermore, we demonstrate that the timecourse of post-copulatory recovery of accessory gland size closely mirrors field observations of mating patterns in c. dalmanni.

RESULTS
we manipulated male mating status by providing males with the opportunity to mate with  <dig> virgin females for  <dig> minutes immediately following artificial dawn. mated males were dissected at fixed times following this mating period  and the sizes of their testes and accessory glands were compared to unmated control males. mating resulted in a significant decrease in accessory gland length, but glands returned to their original size over the course of the next  <dig> to  <dig> hours. at average levels of male eyespan, included to as a measure of body size to control for allometric variation , mating status affected accessory gland length . post-hoc tukey hsd tests revealed that males dissected immediately after mating or  <dig> hours after mating exhibited significantly smaller accessory glands than unmated controls. gland length began to recover after  <dig> hours and by  <dig> hours after mating the accessory glands were significantly longer than immediately following mating . removing unmated control males from the analysis revealed a positive effect of mating frequency on accessory gland length  after controlling for the significant effect of recovery time . males mated a mean ± s.e. of  <dig>  ±  <dig>   times during the course of the  <dig> minute observation period, and mating frequency did not vary between groups dissected at different times f <dig>  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ). identical results were obtained when accessory gland length was replaced with area, but are not included as accessory gland length and the square root of area were highly positively correlated .

mating did not result in a decrease in testis length compared to unmated controls . however, significant differences in testis length were detected between males measured at different recovery times . post-hoc tukey hsd tests revealed that males allowed to recover for  <dig> hours exhibited shorter testes than males allowed to recover for  <dig> or  <dig> hours. testis length scaled with male eyespan . removing unmated males from the analysis failed to reveal any association between testis length and mating frequency  after controlling for recovery time f <dig>  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) and eyespan . testis length and the square root of area were positively correlated . as testis length explained less than half of the variance in testis area , we also directly compared testis area in males immediately after mating to that in unmated controls and detected no difference .

discussion
male accessory gland size in c. dalmanni decreased dramatically following copulation and slowly recovered over the next 8– <dig> hours. after removing the effect of recovery time, accessory gland length was positively correlated with male mating frequency. neither testis length nor testis area appeared to be altered by copulation; no significant difference in testis length was observed between mated and unmated males in the  <dig> hours following copulation.

both male and female stalk-eyed flies mate frequently. in the current study, each male mated an average of  <dig>  times  during the 60-minute observation period. only  <dig> %  of males mated at least  <dig> times and therefore  <dig> %  of males failed to mate with all  <dig> virgin females provided. as females housed with three males will mate an average of  <dig>  times during the  <dig> minutes following artificial dawn  <cit> , it is clear that male mating frequency was limited by physiological ability rather than the availability of willing females.

in the field, copulations occur primarily at dawn  <cit> . our observations of the recovery of the accessory glands match this behavioural pattern, as  <dig> hours after copulation , the accessory glands had recovered their original pre-mating size. we found that the accessory glands had partially recovered after  <dig> hours which is consistent with the lower frequency of mating observed at dusk  <cit> , whereas little recovery was observed in the hours immediately following copulation when flies leave mating aggregations to forage.

the two most plausible physiological constraints on male mating frequency in c. dalmanni are the availability of accessory gland products and the availability of sperm, both of which are required to produce spermatophores  <cit> . several lines of evidence indicate that accessory gland size is more likely to limit mating frequency than testis length. first, we have demonstrated a decrease in accessory gland size following copulation and the subsequent recovery closely mirrors mating behaviour in the field. no significant reduction in testis size was observed in mated males compared to unmated controls. second, our study confirms the results of a previous experiment showing that accessory gland length, but not testis length, is phenotypically correlated with male mating frequency  <cit> . third, bidirectional artificial selection on male mating frequency produced a correlated response in accessory gland length but not testis length  <cit> . however, we cannot exclude the possibility that some other currently unknown factor is the primary constraint on male mating frequency in c. dalmanni.

the full importance of the accessory glands in stalk-eyed fly reproduction is poorly understood. accessory gland products form the casing of the spermatophore and consequently are necessary for sperm transfer  <cit> . furthermore, accessory gland products appear to be important in sperm competition as seminal fluid can decrease the viability of sperm from particular rival males in the female spermathecae  <cit> . however, in contrast to d. melanogaster  <cit> , accessory gland products do not appear to play a role in sperm displacement  <cit> , the inhibition of female remating  <cit>  or the manipulation of female fecundity  <cit> . consequently, the advantage of large accessory glands is likely gained through both increased mating frequency  and, potentially, greater success under sperm competition.

CONCLUSIONS
when receptive females are not limiting, male mating frequency in c. dalmanni is likely constrained by accessory gland size. copulation causes a significant reduction in accessory gland size and replenishment of the depleted accessory glands follows a time course that is consistent with the observed daily peak in male mating frequency at dawn. there was no reduction in testis size following mating and therefore testis size appears to be of less importance in determining male mating frequency in this species.
