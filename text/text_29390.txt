BACKGROUND
bone morphogenetic proteins  are a subfamily of the tgfβ superfamily of secreted growth factors. originally identified as regulators of bone formation  it is now well established that bmps are major factors of dorso-ventral axis determination from drosophila to mammals . during later development, bmps contribute to neural patterning and differentiation, the induction of the vertebrate neural crest and placodes and the development of the lens and inner ear . bmp signaling is also required in eye development, cardiac, kidney, and thymus organogenesis, germ cell differentiation, and hematopoiesis . in addition, its roles in chondrogenesis, skeletal and limb development and patterning are well documented .

bmp ligands bind to and activate a tetrameric receptor complex composed of two type i and two type ii receptors . type i receptors are also referred to as activin-receptor like kinase . the human genome contains  <dig> transforming growth factor beta  family genes, but only seven genes encoding for type i, and five genes encoding for type ii receptors. bmp receptors are single-pass transmembrane proteins and possess a serine/threonine kinase domain in their intracellular domains . bmp ligands activate only a subset of these receptors, namely bmp receptor ii  or activin receptor iib  as type ii receptors and bmp receptor ia , bmp receptor ib  or activin receptor ia  as type i receptors; in some cases, the activin receptor ib  is also activated  <cit> . upon ligand binding the type ii receptors phosphorylate and activate the type i receptors. in the canonical tgfβ signal transduction pathway, activated type i receptors phosphorylate a receptor substrate protein of the mad/smad family of transcriptional regulators . phosphorylated smads bind another smad family member, the so-called co-smad, which itself is not a substrate of the type i receptor; they are then imported into the nucleus. nuclear smads associate with additional transcriptional regulators and cofactors, and regulate transcription of their target genes . r-smads are subdivided into two groups, the smad 2/ <dig> and the smad 1/5/ <dig> groups, which mediate signaling by tgfβ, activin and nodal ligands or by bmps, respectively .

in xenopus laevis, bmp <dig> is expressed in a semicircle at the ventral side of the embryo at early gastrula stage  <dig>  and plays a major role in the induction of ventral cell fates  <cit> . ventral bmp activity is antagonized by secreted bmp antagonists such as chordin or noggin that are derived from the organizer, thereby creating a bmp gradient that patterns the dorso-ventral axis . similar to ventral bmp <dig> expression in xenopus, graded expression of bmp ligands is involved in dorso-ventral patterning in zebrafish  <cit> . bmp <dig>  bmp <dig> and anti dorsalizing morphogenetic protein  also contribute to ventral cell fate specification in xenopus embryos, although these bmp ligands are expressed without dorso-ventral bias or even exclusively dorsal in the spemann’s organizer . in post-gastrula embryos, bmp ligands are expressed in specific, spatially restricted patterns that reflect their role in the development of the respective tissues and organs.  <cit> . similarly, in tadpole embryos expression of bmpr1a is found in the eye, otic vesicle, kidney, branchial arches, foregut and intersomitic tissue. bmpr1b expression is also detected in the head but not in trunk tissue .

by contrast, little is known about the expression patterns of bmp receptors in early xenopus embryos. here, we have analyzed the expression pattern and function of bmpria/alk <dig> and bmprib/alk <dig> in early xenopus development. we observed only partial functional redundancy of the receptors in dorso-ventral patterning. in late-gastrula and neurula stages the expression patterns and function diverge markedly. in particular, we identified a specific, non-redundant function of alk <dig> in neural crest development.

RESULTS
expression of bmpria/alk <dig> and bmprib/alk <dig> during xenopus development
we have cloned the full-length coding sequence of xenopus laevis bmp-receptor ia  and bmp-receptor ib . first, we compared their temporal and spatial expression pattern in early xenopus embryos. in whole-mount in situ hybridization, alk <dig> rna was detected in the animal hemisphere of early to late-blastula and early gastrula stage embryos. its distribution expanded vegetally, but remained excluded from the vegetal pole, in mid-gastrula stage embryos . notably, no dorso-ventral bias was observed. alk <dig> rna was not detected in blastula stages and only very weakly in early and mid-gastrula stage embryos. by late-gastrula, at nieuwkoop and faber stage  <dig>  the spatial expression patterns of alk <dig> and alk <dig> became divergent. while alk <dig> expression remained ubiquitious, alk <dig> was specifically upregulated in the anterior neural plate. this temporal and spatial expression pattern is conserved between xenopus and zebrafish gastrulae  <cit> . in the mouse, alk <dig> is also ubiquitously expressed until e <dig> , whereas alk <dig> was detected only from e <dig>  onwards and showed a more restricted expression pattern when compared to alk <dig>  <cit> .fig.  <dig> expression patterns of alk <dig> and alk <dig> in early xenopus laevis embryos. a temporal and spatial expression patterns were determined by whole-mount in situ hybridization at the indicated nieuwkoop and faber  stages. b expression of alk <dig> and alk <dig> was quantified by real-time rt-pcr at the indicated stages; corresponding synthetic sequences were used a external standards for copy number determination. the graph shows the copy number per embryo. c nf stage  <dig>  embryos were bisected into dorsal and ventral halves and transcripts of the indicated genes were detected by rt-pcr



in neurula stages, alk <dig> was still ubiquitously expressed, but we observed a slightly more intense staining for alk <dig> at the neural plate border in nf stage  <dig> embryos and in the anterior neural plate in nf stage  <dig> embryos. again, alk <dig> showed a strikingly different expression pattern during neurulation with the strongest expression at the neural plate border, in the anterior neural plate and in the prospective neural crest . the neural crest is induced at the neural plate border by a combination of intermediate levels of bmp signaling, wnt and fgf signaling . among the gene network that defines the neural crest, a subset of genes has been identified as direct targets of the bmp pathway via smads, including the neural plate border specifying gene msx <dig>  <cit>  and slug  <cit> . therefore the restricted expression pattern of alk <dig> in the prospective neural crest suggests a specific role of alk <dig> in neural crest specification and development.

in early tadpole stages, expression of alk <dig> was detected in the brain and the eye, corresponding to the upregulation in the anterior neural plate at nf stage  <dig>  by contrast, at nf stage  <dig>  alk <dig> was strongly expressed in the brain, the ventral part of the eye and in the migrating neural crest cells . in later tadpole stages we observed expression of both genes in the brain, the eye, the otic vesicle and the branchial arches, alk <dig> transcripts were additionally detected in the heart, in intersomitic tissue and the pronephros . alk <dig> was detected in the brain, eye, otic vesicle and branchial arches, although in a more spatially restricted pattern than alk <dig>  in contrast to an earlier report  <cit> , we also detected alk <dig> expression in the notochord . these late expression patterns mostly recapitulate tadpole expression of both type i bmp receptors, as reported in other studies . in addition, the tadpole expression showed considerable overlap with the expression of bmprii  <cit> .

the increased expression of alk <dig> from late-gastrula onwards, which was detected by in situ hybridization , correlated well with the expression levels of alk <dig> and alk <dig> determined by real-time rt-pcr . expression levels of alk <dig> decreased by 50 % from nf stage  <dig> to nf stage  <dig> and then remained constant until stage  <dig>  by contrast, alk <dig> levels were  <dig> to 10-fold lower than alk <dig> from nf stage  <dig> to  <dig> and showed a marked increase from nf stage  <dig> to  <dig>  which resulted in an overall higher expression of alk <dig> when compared to alk <dig> at nf stage  <dig> . in addition, rt-pcr analysis of semi-sectioned nf stage  <dig>  embryos confirmed that alk <dig>  alk <dig> and also the type ii receptor bmpr <dig> were expressed equally in the dorsal and ventral halves . the same was true for the activin receptors acvr1a/alk <dig>  acvr1b/alk <dig> and acvr <dig> at that stage .

the expression pattern of both alk <dig> and alk <dig> in pre- and early gastrula stage embryos mirrors the unbiased expression of bmprii, bmp <dig> and bmp <dig>  <cit> . according to current knowledge, bmp <dig> and bmp <dig> and the ventrally expressed bmp <dig> activate ventralizing bmp signaling in early embryos. the dorso-ventral gradient of bmp activity found in late blastula and early gastrula xenopus embryos  <cit>  is shaped by ventrally expressed positive regulators and bmp antagonists arising from the dorsal organizer . alk <dig> and alk <dig> can act as receptors for bmp <dig>  bmp <dig> and bmp <dig>  <cit> ; therefore, they are likely to mediate signaling from all three ligands in early embryos.

to further elucidate the role of alk <dig> and alk <dig> we have performed loss-of-function studies, focusing on pre-gastrula development and characterizing a putative specific role of alk <dig> in the neural crest.

knock-down of alk <dig> and alk <dig> results in partially dorsalized embryos and additional specific phenotypes
to investigate the role of alk <dig> and alk <dig> in xenopus development, we have designed two translation-blocking antisense morpholino oligonucleotides , which target non-overlapping sequences to knock-down each protein .

we injected alk <dig> mo or alk <dig> mo into both blastomeres of two-cell stage embryos and analyzed the resulting phenotypes at nf stage  <dig>  first, we noticed that knock-down of alk <dig>  particularly with alk <dig> mo <dig>  caused a higher lethality of embryos when compared to injection of alk <dig> mo or control mo. at neurula stages,  <dig> of  <dig> embryos out of three independent injections with alk <dig> mo <dig> survived whereas the numbers of surviving embryos injected with alk <dig> mo <dig> , alk <dig> mo <dig>  or alk <dig> mo <dig>  were similar to the control mo . at stage  <dig>  the survival of alk <dig> mo <dig> and alk <dig> mo <dig> injected embryos dropped to 17 ±  <dig>  and 26 ± 13 %  respectively. by comparison, 50–56 % embryos survived to stage  <dig> after injection of either control mo, alk <dig> mo <dig> or alk <dig> mo <dig> .

compared to control embryos , we observed a range of phenotypes in the alk <dig> or alk <dig> morphant embryos that reached tadpole stage. the weakest phenotypes showed defects or partial loss of the ventral fin  or defective pigmentation of the retina . stronger phenotypes included anterio-dorsalized embryos with a progressive loss of ventral and posterior structures . a subset of embryos showed increased pigmentation of the head and less protruding branchial arches, indicating that neural crest development was affected . this phenotype was further investigated and the results are shown in figs.  <dig> and  <dig>  in addition, we observed complex phenotypes that affect multiple structures . dorsalized and eye phenotypes were most frequent in alk <dig> morphant embryos and no significant difference was observed between alk <dig> mo <dig> and alk <dig> mo <dig>  by contrast, knock-down of alk <dig> predominantly resulted in neural crest and pigmentation phenotypes. although alk <dig> mo <dig> appeared to induce the phenotype with higher frequency, the difference between alk <dig> mo <dig> and alk <dig> mo <dig> was statistically not significant .fig.  <dig> phenotypes of alk <dig> and alk <dig> morphant embryos. embryos were injected with  <dig>  pmol antisense morpholino in both blastomeres at the 2-cell stage as indicated and cultured till nf stage  <dig>  a normal nf stage  <dig> embryos after injection of an unrelated control morpholino oligonucleotide . b embryos injected with either alk <dig> or alk <dig> translation blocking morpholino oligonucleotides  showing defects in the development of ventral fins. c in the retina of a subset of either alk <dig> mo or alk <dig> mo injected embryos un- or less pigmented patches were observed. d dorsalized alk <dig> morphant embryo. e alk <dig> morphant embryo showing increased pigmentation of the head and narrower gills. f in most cases alk <dig> or alk <dig> morphant embryos exhibited complex phenotypes with defects in the ventral fin, retina pigmentation, smaller or absent eyes, aberrant pigmentation and loss of cranial cartilage. black arrowheads indicate eye phenotypes, white arrows missing ventral structures and black arrows mark the cranial cartilage. g phenotype frequencies from at least three independent experiments are summarized in the graph. differences between indicated groups were analyzed using the Χ
 <dig> test. statistically significant deviations  are indicated by double asterisks; n.s.: not significant



homozygous deletion of alk <dig> in mice is early embryonic lethal  <cit> . because morpholino oligonucleotide injections in two-cell stage xenopus embryos did not deplete maternal protein, early lethality could not be expected. homozygous alk <dig> knock-out mice are viable and show moderate skeletal phenotypes  <cit> . the same study suggested overlapping and redundant functions of alk <dig> with other bmp receptors in mouse development. since the knock-down of alk <dig> in xenopus embryos resulted in higher lethality and equally severe, albeit different phenotypes as compared to the alk <dig> knock-down, less functional overlap of these two type  <dig> bmp receptors could be assumed in xenopus laevis.

compound phenotypes in the surviving embryos were expected, based on the complex expression patterns of alk <dig> and alk <dig>  and are comparable to phenotypes reported for alk <dig> or alk <dig> loss-of-function in other vertebrates. the role of both, alk <dig> and alk <dig> in the development of the retina and lens is well established in mouse and chick embryos . in addition, defects in brain and cranio-facial development as well as cartilage and bone formation have been described . likewise, we observed defects in the forebrain region, smaller or absent eyes, which indicates that the developmental functions of alk <dig> and alk <dig> are conserved within vertebrates to a considerable extent. in addition, we observed aberrant pigmentation and cranio-facial deformation, indicating defects in the development of neural crest derived melanocytes and cartilage  <cit> . interestingly and most notably, these phenotypes have been predominantly observed in alk <dig> morphants, supporting a specific role of alk <dig> in the development of the neural crest.

by contrast, we observed predominantly dorsalized phenotypes in alk3-deficient embryos, which is in agreement with blastula-stage expression of alk <dig> and its assumed role in early dorso-ventral patterning. dorsalized phenotypes were also observed in alk <dig> morphant embryos although with lower frequency. the weakest phenotype affecting ventral structures were defects in the ventral fin, development of which depends on bmp signaling. in zebrafish, inactivating or dominant-negative mutations in bmp pathway genes, such as bmp2b, smad <dig> or tolloid, result in the loss of the ventral fin  <cit> . in xenopus, formation of the ventral fin is similarly dependent on the ventral-most portion of the mesoderm  <cit>  which is specified by bmp signaling. interestingly, in zebrafish embryos, loss of the ventral fin has been attributed to alk <dig>  which is most closely related to alk <dig> in other vertebrates  <cit> .

the higher frequency of dorsalized embryos in alk <dig> morphant embryos, as compared to the alk <dig> knock-down was consistent with the expression of these type i bmp receptors in pre-gastrula stage embryos. we already detected alk <dig> rna in early blastula-stage embryos, whereas alk <dig> expression remained very low until late gastrula . together these results support a major role of alk <dig> and a minor contribution of alk <dig> in transducing ventralizing bmp signals in early embryonic development.

both type i bmp receptors contribute to dorso-ventral patterning
in order to confirm that the observed dorsalization phenotype in alk <dig> and alk <dig> morphant embryos was related to a role in early dorso-ventral axis specification, we next analyzed the influence of single and double knock-downs on the expression of the dorsally expressed organizer genes chordin, admp and goosecoid   <cit>  as well as the ventral marker genes bmp <dig>  vent <dig> and sizzled  <cit>  in early gastrula stage embryos.

the transcripts of chordin, admp and goosecoid were exclusively detected in the dorsal halves of control embryos . in alk <dig> morphants, these dorsal genes were also detected in the ventral halves of the embryos. this effect was weakest for chordin, but clearly detectable for admp and goosecoid. by contrast, in alk <dig> morphant embryos the dorsal expression of admp and goosecoid appeared to be slightly weaker and no expression was detected in the ventral half. in the double morphant embryos, all three dorsal genes were clearly detected in the ventral hemisphere . the inverse was observed when we investigated expression levels of the ventrally expressed genes bmp <dig>  vent <dig> and sizzled. expression of bmp <dig> and vent <dig> was lower in the ventral halves of alk <dig>  alk <dig> or double morphant embryos. when analyzing sizzled expression a detectably weaker expression was only observed in double morphant embryos, whereas single knock-down of either alk <dig> or alk <dig> had no effect.fig.  <dig> alk <dig> and alk <dig> are required for dorso-ventral patterning. a 2-cell-stage embryos were injected with  <dig>  pmol control mo, alk <dig> mo or alk <dig> mo in both blastomeres as indicated, cultured till stage  <dig>  and bisected into dorsal  and ventral  halves. expression of the organizer genes chordin , admp and goosecoid  and the ventral genes bmp <dig>  vent <dig> and sizzled was analyzed by rt-pcr. the images show one set out of three independent experiments.  embryos were injected with fluorescein-labeled dextran as lineage tracer and antisense morpholino oligonucleotides as indicated into one blastomere at the 2-cell-stage. for rescue experiments, 50 pg of alk <dig> rna or alk <dig> rna were co-injected. the embryos were cultured till stage  <dig>  and chordin expression was visualized by whole-mount in situ hybridization. b representative examples of phenotypes injected as indicated are shown. asterisks indicate the injected side, dashed lines mark the dorsal midline as determined by the lineage tracer. c the chordin-positive area and staining intensity have been measured on the injected and uninjected side of each embryo. the graph displays the average ratio of area size between injected and uninjected side  as well as the mean intensity/area  from three independent experiments. differences of area ratios between injection groups have been analyzed using a separate variance t-test and statistically significant deviations are indicated by double asterisks ; n.s.: not significant. the average intensity/area did not change significantly. d for comparison, an embryo injected with 50 pg rna encoding dnalk <dig> is shown. in  <dig> out of  <dig> embryos dnalk <dig> induced strongly expanded or ectopic chordin expression



although this experiment was not quantitative, it suggested that knock-down of alk <dig> and double knock-down of alk <dig> and alk <dig> might result in an expansion of the organizer domain into the ventral half of the embryo, which would lead to a dorsalized phenotype. dorsalization was indeed observed predominantly in alk <dig> morphant embryos . overall, these results indicated that both alk <dig> and alk <dig> play a role in dorso-ventral patterning and contribute to the expression of ventral genes, as demonstrated by the pronounced downregulation of bmp <dig>  vent <dig> and sizzled in double morphant embryos.

in order to further investigate the effect of alk <dig> or alk <dig> depletion on the organizer, we performed whole mount in situ hybridizations using a chordin antisense probe in single-side injected embryos. consistent with the aforementioned rt-pcr results, the area containing chordin-positive cells was enlarged by 50–70 % in alk <dig> morphant embryos injected with either alk <dig> mo  <dig> or alk <dig> mo  <dig>  while the average staining intensity for chordin relative to the expression area remained unchanged . this expansion of the chordin-expressing area was reverted by co-injection of alk <dig> rna. by contrast, depletion of alk <dig> did not significantly affect the distribution of chordin-expression or the relative staining intensity . although alk <dig> knock-down significantly expanded the chordin-positive area, this effect was mild when compared to the overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of alk <dig> . dnalk <dig> induced strongly expanded and ectopic chordin expression in the majority of embryos . by contrast, we did not observe ectopic chordin expression in alk <dig> morphant embryos. this discrepancy is likely due to the presence of maternal protein and possibly a contribution of additional type i receptors, such as alk <dig> or alk <dig>  <cit>  to the early bmp signal. both alk <dig> and alk <dig> are expressed in early xenopus embryos  and their activation by bmp ligands would also be inhibited by dnalk <dig> but not by alk <dig> knock-down.

we next confirmed that the upregulation of dorsal genes in alk <dig> morphant embryos observed at early gastrula stages indeed results in an expansion of dorsal tissues; therefore, we analyzed the influence of alk <dig> knock-down on neural induction. consistent with our previous results, single knock-down of alk <dig> was sufficient to induce mild broadening of the neural plate and expression of the pan-neural marker sox <dig> . this alk <dig> mo  <dig> phenotype was rescued by co-injection of either morpholino-insensitve alk <dig> rna or alk <dig> rna, demonstrating the specificity of this knock-down phenotype and functional redundancy of alk <dig> and alk6 . bringing back alk <dig> also resulted in a downregulation of sox <dig> in roughly 15 % of the embryos, which indicated an over-compensation of the morphant phenotype. comparable results were obtained using alk <dig> mo 2; the size of the sox2-positive area was increased by  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % by injection of alk <dig> mo  <dig> and by 11 ±  <dig>  % by alk <dig> mo  <dig> respectively. however, in embryos injected with alk <dig> mo  <dig>  broadening of the neural plate occurred more frequently as compared to alk <dig> mo  <dig> . double knock-down of alk <dig> and alk <dig> did not further increase the percentage of embryos showing an enlarged sox2-positive area.fig.  <dig> ectopic alk <dig> can substitute alk <dig> knock-down in dorso-ventral patterning. embryos were injected laterally in one dorsal blastomere at the 4-cell stage with  <dig>  pg of alk <dig> or alk <dig> mos and, for rescue experiments, co-injected with 50 pg of alk <dig> rna or alk <dig> rna. a lacz plasmid was co-injected to identify the injected side, embryos were cultured till stage  <dig> and stained for lacz. the neuroectoderm was visualized by in situ hybridization against the pan-neural marker gene sox <dig>  embryos were categorized according to expanded or reduced sox <dig> expression and differences between indicated groups were analyzed using the Χ
 <dig> test. statistically significant deviations  are indicated by double asterisks; n.s.: not significant. a representative images of alk <dig> morphant embryos and the corresponding rescue experiments are shown. embryos were injected as indicated; asterisks indicate the injected side. b results from at least three independent experiments are summarized in the graph. c representative images of alk <dig> morphant embryos and the corresponding rescue experiments are shown. embryos were injected as indicated; asterisks indicate the injected side. d results from at least three independent experiments are summarized in the graph



we repeated this experiment and targeted the injections to one animal blastomere of eight-cell stage embryos, which should limit the knock-down to the ectoderm and avoid interfering with organizer formation. the outcome was very similar to the results obtained after injection at the four-cell stage . ectodermal knock-down of alk <dig> by alk <dig> mo  <dig> or alk <dig> mo  <dig> resulted in an increase of the sox2-positive area by 14 ±  <dig>  and 18 ±  <dig>  % respectively. again, the phenotype was rescued by both alk <dig> rna and alk <dig> rna. these results indicated that in addition to its role in early dorso-ventral specification, alk <dig> also influenced ectodermal patterning.

overall, we have demonstrated a role for alk <dig> in the specification of ventral cells fates and ectodermal patterning. however, we observed only moderate dorsalization even after alk3/ <dig> double knock-down. our data are consistent with a comparable study in zebrafish in which the double knock-down of alk <dig> and alk <dig> resulted in only weakly dorsalized phenotypes  <cit> . morpholino mediated knock-down did not affect maternal protein, which is possibly a cause for these results. in addition, triple knock-down of the bmp ligands bmp <dig>  bmp <dig> and bmp <dig> induced only moderate dorsalization with decreased sizzled expression and no effect on chordin  <cit> . the same group showed that strong dorsalization required additional knock-down of admp  <cit> . knock-down of alk <dig> or alk <dig> is not expected to affect admp activity, because admp does not bind to alk <dig> or alk <dig>  but to alk <dig>  <cit> . alk <dig> and alk <dig> have been identified as receptors for bmp <dig>  bmp <dig> and bmp <dig> in multiple studies  <cit> . both alk <dig> and alk <dig> form receptor complexes with bmprii  <cit>  and bmp <dig> as well as bmp <dig> signal via heteromeric receptor complexes comprising different type i receptors in dorso-ventral patterning in zebrafish  <cit> . therefore the highly similar effect of bmp2/4/ <dig> knock-down  <cit>  and alk3/ <dig> knockdown  support the conclusion that alk <dig> and alk <dig> predominantly act as receptors for bmp <dig>  bmp <dig> and bmp <dig> ligands in early dorso-ventral patterning.

moreover, we observed that alk <dig> knock-down is sufficient to expand the expression territory of organizer genes in early gastrula stage embryos, indicating that alk <dig> is the dominant type i receptor in the bmp activity gradient that antagonizes expression of organizer genes. such a bigger role for alk <dig> as compared to alk <dig> is in agreement with higher expression levels of alk <dig> in pre- and early gastrula stages.

we also analyzed sox <dig> expression in alk <dig> morphant embryos. interestingly, injection of alk <dig> mo  <dig> or alk <dig> mo  <dig> into one dorsal blastomere of four-cell stage embryos resulted in an anterior downregulation of sox <dig> on the injected side at neurula stages . the size of the sox2-positive area was reduced by 10 ±  <dig>  and 17 ±  <dig>  % in embryos injected with alk <dig> mo  <dig> and alk <dig> mo  <dig>  respectively. this phenotype was rescued by co-injection of either alk <dig> rna or alk <dig> rna , which is contradictory to the results shown above that demonstrate a role of alk <dig> in ventral specification and antagonizing neural induction. an alk <dig> gain-of-function would be expected to inhibit neural induction and thus reduce the size of the sox <dig> expression area. in addition, these results overall are contradictory to the theory that bmp activity antagonizes neural induction  <cit> . moreover, we did not observe a significant effect of alk <dig> knock-down on the size of the organizer as determined by the chordin-positive area at early gastrula . taking into account that alk <dig> expression is very low during gastrulation but upregulated in the anterior neural plate and neural plate border at late gastrula and early neurula stages, this decrease of sox <dig> is possibly not caused by alterations of the early bmp gradient. instead, a role of alk <dig> in the development or maintenance of anterior neural tissue after neural induction might be hypothesized, however, the nature and mechanism of such a putative function remains to be investigated.

alk <dig> is required for neural crest specification
the alk <dig> morphant phenotype with embryos showing a marked increase of pigment cells, and in some cases a dramatic loss of cranial cartilage, indicated defects in neural crest development . since alk <dig> is specifically upregulated in the neural crest during neurulation , we analyzed its role in neural crest development in more detail.

alk <dig> morphant embryos frequently showed an increased number of melanocytes in the dorsal head region, which was in most cases accompanied by deformed branchial arches . closer examination of these embryos revealed aberrant localization of melanocytes in both alk <dig> mo  <dig> and alk <dig> mo  <dig> injected embryos. many melanocytes were found in the dorsal head region, whereas the flank in most embryos was less pigmented. in addition, we observed ectopic melanocytes in the dorsal fin , indicating aberrant specification or migration of neural crest derived melanocyte precursors.fig.  <dig> alk <dig> is required for neural crest development. a when compared to control mo injected embryos, alk <dig> morphant embryos showed increased pigmentation of the head , ectopic melanocytes in the dorsal fin  and narrower heads reflected by less lateral protrusion of the gills and smaller distance between the eyes . b cranial cartilage from embryos injected as indicated was stained with alcian blue dye. cartilage from alk <dig> morphant embryos generally showed weaker staining, was smaller  and showed partial or complete loss of cartilage elements  of the gills  or ceratohyal cartilage . the images in a and b show representative examples from one out of three independent experiments. c embryos were injected with  <dig>  pmol morpholino in one animal-dorsal blastomere at the 8-cell stage as indicated. a lacz plasmid was co-injected to identify the injected side, embryos were cultured till stage  <dig> and stained for lacz. expression of msx <dig> was analyzed by whole-mount in situ hybridization. representative images of embryos injected as indicated are shown. asterisks indicate the injected side. the results from three independent experiments are summarized in the graph . active bmp signaling at the neural plate border was shown by whole-mount immunostaining for phosphorylated smad 1/5/ <dig> . e the graph shows a summary of psmad1/5/ <dig> staining results from two independent experiments. in  representative images of embryos injected with control mo, alk <dig> mo  <dig> or alk <dig> mo  <dig> are shown. embryos were categorized according to decreased or enhanced msx <dig> expression or psmad 1/5/ <dig> staining respectively and differences between indicated groups were analyzed using the Χ
 <dig> test. statistically significant deviations  are indicated by double asterisks; n.s.: not significant



embryos showing aberrant pigmentation were subjected to alcian blue staining of the cranial cartilage. all alk <dig> morphant embryos showed fainter cartilage staining, indicating incomplete cartilage differentiation. in addition, we observed a range of defects in the cranial cartilage. in milder cases, parts of the gills were missing and the ceratohyal cartilage was smaller or deformed; overall, the cartilage elements present were only faintly stained. in the most severe cases, only tiny, unstructured remnants of cartilage were found . the requirement of alk <dig> in chondrogenic differentiation of the cranial cartilage, as indicated by reduced alcian blue staining, is consistent with the role of alk <dig> in cartilage and bone formation in the mouse  <cit> . moreover, the partial or complete loss of cranial cartilage elements  together with the prominent expression of alk <dig> in pre-migratory and migrating neural crest cells  indicated an additional role in early neural crest development.

neural crest development begins in the dorso-lateral marginal zone of early gastrula embryos in xenopus. in this region attenuated bmp activity combined with active wnt/β-catenin signaling specifies neural crest precursors  <cit> . after gastrulation neural crest precursors are located at the neural plate border and identified by the expression of a specific set of transcription factors, including msx <dig> and msx <dig>  that induce further neural crest development .

to address the question of whether the neural crest is not induced in alk <dig> morphants or if neural crest cells get lost during pre-migratory development, we analyzed the expression of msx <dig> in the neural plate border at late gastrula stages. both alk <dig> and alk <dig> loss-of-function resulted in a downregulation of msx <dig>  although 23 % of alk <dig> morphant embryos showed an increase of msx <dig> . in the alk <dig> morphants, no increased msx <dig> expression was observed, but more than 70 % of embryos showed a decrease or loss of msx <dig> expression , thus demonstrating further that particularly alk <dig> plays a crucial role in neural crest development. interestingly, the frequency of increased and decreased msx <dig> expression in double morphant embryos represented the average of phenotype frequencies that were observed in the single knock-downs , indicating that alk <dig> and alk <dig> affect msx <dig> expression independently of each other.

it has been shown that reducing bmp activity in blastula or gastrula stages results in a shift and expansion of the neural plate border area as well as upregulation of neural crest markers  <cit> . such expansion of the msx <dig> expression area was only observed in approximately one quarter of alk <dig> morphant embryos, which is consistent with the role of alk <dig> in dorso-ventral patterning discussed above. on the other hand, msx <dig> and msx <dig> are regulated by bmp signaling, and msx <dig> has been identified as a direct bmp target  <cit> . the observed downregulation of msx <dig> in alk <dig> and alk <dig> morphant embryos coincided with the upregulation of both type i receptors at the neural plate border in late gastrulation ; together, these observations strongly suggested a role for alk <dig> and alk <dig> in this smad-dependent transcriptional regulation.

to confirm that both receptors signal to smad at the neural plate border, we probed nf stage  <dig> embryos for the presence of active phosphorylated smad1/5/ <dig>  using a phospho-specific antibody. we observed a narrow stripe of psmad1/5/ <dig> positive cells along the neural plate border. this local activation of bmp signaling was detectable from nf stage  <dig>  onward, again coinciding with the upregulation of alk <dig> as well as alk <dig>  albeit to a lesser extent, at the neural plate border. after injection of alk <dig> mo, we detected a decrease of psmad 1/5/ <dig> at the neural plate border in approximately 50 % of the embryos. the effect was again more pronounced in alk <dig> morphants , which showed a reduction of psmad 1/5/ <dig> in over 70 % of the embryos. this result demonstrated that both alk <dig> and alk <dig> activate smad in neural plate border cells. moreover, psmad data were highly similar to the msx <dig> expression data , which is consistent with msx <dig> being a direct target gene of bmp signaling  <cit> . therefore it is conceivable that both alk <dig> and alk <dig> contribute to the activation of smad at the neural plate border, thereby upregulating bmp-responsive neural plate border genes such as msx <dig> and msx <dig>  according to current models of neural crest development in xenopus, neural crest precursors are first specified at early gastrula stages by the combined input of low bmp and low wnt/β-catenin signaling  <cit> . during gastrulation, cells located lateral of the future neural plate receive wnt/β-catenin, fgf, notch and bmp signals that induce the expression of neural plate border specifying or pre-patterning genes such as gbx <dig>  pax <dig>  zic <dig>  msx <dig> and the bmp target gene msx <dig> . these neural plate border factors govern further induction of neural crest cells and the expression of genes required for proliferation, survival and migration of the neural crest, including ap2α, foxd <dig>  sox <dig>  sox <dig>  sox <dig>  slug, snail and twist .

consistent with a role of alk <dig> in neural plate border specification, sox <dig> was severely downregulated in alk <dig> depleted embryos at neurula stages . we observed decreased expression of sox <dig> in approximately 50 % of all embryos injected with alk <dig> mo <dig>  co-injection of mo-insensitive alk <dig> rna fully rescued sox <dig> expression and further supported a role of alk <dig> in neural crest induction . interestingly, the frequency of the neural crest induction phenotype dropped from over 70 % of embryos showing decreased msx <dig> expression at nf stage  <dig> to 50 % embryos with decreased sox <dig> expression at nf stage  <dig>  this decline of phenotype frequency indicated a partial regeneration of neural crest cells; such regenerative potential has also been observed in chick embryos after removal of neural crest cells  <cit> . in addition, proliferation of pre-migratory neural crest cells could contribute to the observed partial recovery of the neural crest population between nf stage  <dig> and nf stage  <dig> fig.  <dig> analysis of sox <dig> and twist expression in alk <dig> morphant embryos. embryos were injected with  <dig>  pmol morpholino targeted animally in one dorsal blastomere at the 4-cell stage. a lacz plasmid was co-injected to identify the injected side, embryos were cultured till stage  <dig> or  <dig> and stained for lacz. the neural crest was visualized by in situ hybridization against sox <dig> at stage  <dig> and against twist at stage  <dig>  differences between indicated groups were analyzed using the Χ
 <dig> test. statistically significant deviations  are indicated by double asterisks; n.s.: not significant. a representative images of embryos hybridized against sox <dig> and injected as indicated are shown. the alk <dig> mo phenotype was rescued by co-injection of 50 pg alk <dig> rna. asterisks indicate the injected side. the results from three independent experiments are summarized in the graph . c representative images of the uninjected and injected sides of embryos of stage  <dig> embryos hybridized against twist are shown. embryos were injected with  <dig>  pmol of alk <dig> mo 1; for rescue experiments 25 pg of alk <dig> plasmid dna or alk <dig> plasmid dna were co-injected. the results from three independent experiments are summarized in the graph 



we next visualized the migrating neural crest in nf stage  <dig> embryos by in situ hybridization for twist expression. alk <dig> mo  <dig> injection induced a downregulation of twist in 36 % of the embryos . this further decline in frequency of the “decreased” neural crest marker gene phenotype supports the assumption that the neural crest population is partially recovering in alk <dig> morphant embryos. by contrast, single knock-down of alk <dig> resulted in less than 15 % of induction defects  as compared to 45 % at nf stage  <dig> . this might simply indicate a delayed specification of the neural plate border in alk <dig> depleted embryos, where alk <dig> function could be compensated albeit belatedly by redundant proteins, such as alk <dig>  during later neural crest development. notably, alk <dig> knock-down was not fully compensated until tadpole stages, which suggests a partially non-redundant role of alk <dig> in post-induction neural crest development. such an additional role of alk <dig> is further supported by the occurrence of impaired neural crest migration in 24 % of alk <dig> morphant embryos that was not observed in alk <dig> mo-injected embryos . however, it cannot be concluded whether alk <dig> itself plays a direct role in neural crest migration or if the observed migration defects are secondary effects of impaired neural crest specification in these embryos.

to rescue the alk <dig> mo phenotype without interfering with dorso-ventral patterning, we co-injected plasmids encoding alk <dig> or alk <dig> that are expressed only when zygotic transcription is initiated after the mid-blastula transition. the neural crest phenotype in alk <dig> morphants was not rescued by co-injection of alk <dig> plasmid dna, although an upregulation of twist was observed in a low percentage of embryos when alk <dig> was overexpressed in the alk <dig> morphant background . by contrast, alk <dig> mo was fully rescued by co-injection of alk <dig> plasmid dna , which again confirmed a specific, non-redundant function of alk <dig> in the neural crest. injection of plasmid dna typically results in a mosaic expression of the gene. assuming that the alk <dig> knock-down phenotype could be compensated partially by expansion of the residual neural crest progenitor population, the plasmid would restore alk <dig> in a subset of cells and thereby increase this progenitor population sufficiently to allow full regeneration of the neural crest. notably, maintenance of the neural crest fate during neurulation requires secreted growth factors that are derived from adjacent tissues including bmps from the non-neural ectoderm and wnt signals from the underlying paraxial mesoderm  <cit> . therefore, alk <dig> function could also be indirect via a secreted factor. in this case, restoring alk <dig> function in a mosaic pattern by plasmid dna injection would also be sufficient to fully rescue the phenotype because the secreted protein would act on all receiving cells within its range of action.

altogether, these results demonstrate a role of alk <dig> and alk <dig> in the early specification of neural crest precursors whereas exclusively alk <dig> is required for neural crest maintenance and migration in post-gastrula stages.

in this study, we have demonstrated that alk <dig> and alk <dig> are required for early neural crest precursor specification during gastrulation, although likely to be independent from each other. consistent with a role of both receptors in early bmp-dependent dorso-ventral patterning of the embryo as shown and discussed above, it is conceivable that alk <dig> and alk <dig> signaling first contributes to positioning of the neural plate border and then mediates the moderate activation of bmp signaling in cells lateral of the neural plate that leads to the expression of neural plate border genes such as msx <dig>  at late gastrula and early neurula stages, alk <dig> is expressed in this region, and alk <dig> expression is upregulated in the anterior neural plate and at the neural plate border from nf stage  <dig> onwards. this locally elevated expression correlates temporally and spatially with a local activation of smad, and we have demonstrated that once again both type i receptors play a role in this process. however, we also observed that specifically alk <dig>  but not alk <dig>  plays an essential role in post-gastrula neural crest development.

the transition from cell fate specification at the neural plate border to maintenance of neural crest identity and further development takes place in early neurula stages. based on expression patterns and functional analyses, we propose that a switch from an early, cooperative and redundant function of alk <dig> and alk <dig> in neural crest specification towards a highly specific function of alk <dig> in neural crest maintenance and migration takes place during this phase. this could be related to a change in bmp ligands that are available. during early embryonic development, bmp <dig>  bmp <dig> and bmp <dig> are expressed and required for dorso-ventral patterning, and all three ligands can signal via alk <dig> or alk <dig> or heteromeric receptor complexes  <cit> . a recent study in zebrafish showed that in early neurulation two distinct domains of active bmp signaling demarcate the borders between epidermis, pre-placodal ectoderm and the neural crest; it also showed that this local bmp activation depends on gdf <dig>  also known as bmp <dig>  <cit> . in xenopus, gdf <dig> is expressed in a single stripe at the neural plate border from late gastrula stage until late neurula stages  <cit> , overlapping with alk <dig> expression as shown in fig. 1a. consistently, we detected only one stripe of psmad1/5/ <dig> along the neural plate border at nf stage  <dig>  despite this difference, which might be due to temporal divergence of neural crest and placodal specification between zebrafish and xenopus, it is likely that gdf <dig> mediated local activation of bmp signaling in the neural crest is conserved in both species. gdf <dig> signals via alk <dig> and alk <dig> but displays a preference towards alk <dig>  <cit> . we have demonstrated herein that in xenopus the transition from cell fate specification to maintenance of neural crest identity is accompanied by a shift in type i receptor requirement towards alk <dig>  therefore we propose that post-gastrula neural crest development specifically requires alk <dig> to mediate gdf <dig> signaling, a hypothesis that needs to be further investigated in the future.

CONCLUSIONS
here we have demonstrated overlapping and non-redundant functions of the type i bmp receptors alk <dig> and alk <dig> in early xenopus development. both contribute to bmp dependent ventral identity, but alk <dig> is additionally required for gene expression and size of the dorsal organizer in xenopus embryos. these results show that despite overlapping expression patterns and activation of the same smad signaling pathway, alk <dig> and alk <dig> exert temporally and spatially specific, diverging functions; indeed, they are important factors in the regulatory network that controls patterning of early embryos and the ectoderm.

in addition, we have demonstrated a highly specific expression of alk <dig> in the neural crest and an exclusive requirement of alk <dig> in neural crest induction and development. alk <dig> likely acts a receptor for gdf <dig> in the neural crest and mediates neural crest development via an evolutionary conserved mechanism in the transition from neural crest specification to maintenance and further determination of cell fate.
