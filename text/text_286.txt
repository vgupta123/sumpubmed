BACKGROUND
neurogenesis relies on a pool of proliferative neural stem cells differentiating into new neurons following induction of a neurogenic gene expression program. the whole maturation process from the multipotent neural stem cells into functional mature neurons involves several factors that orchestrate each step in an intricate continuum. a key event of neurogenesis is the neuronal commitment of multipotent neural stem cells, i.e. the time point at which cells lose their capacity to generate neurons as well as glia, and become restricted to the generation of new neurons.

doublecortin  constitutes a marker for neuronal precursors throughout developmental and adult neurogenesis  <cit> . we demonstrated that dcx was expressed very early in newly generated neuronal precursors of the adult cns  <cit> . recently, a cortical subpopulation of multipotent dcx- ng2-expressing cells was reported in the adult cns  <cit> . however, the identity of these cells and how they related to neurogenic processes has currently not been elucidated.

although expression of dcx is well documented in neuronal precursors in vivo and in primary cell cultures, a cell line inducing sustained expression of dcx upon differentiation needed so far to be identified. the identification of such an in vitro model reproducing the early phases of neuronal determination would greatly accelerate the study of factors influencing neurogenesis. ntera- <dig> cells have been previously reported to induce a complex neuronal differentiation program in response to retinoic acid . based on the induction of dcx and dcx-driven reporter constructs upon differentiation, we further substantiated evidences establishing the ntera- <dig> cell line as an appropriate and convenient in vitro model to study early steps of neuronal differentiation and factors acting on this process during development and in the adult cns.

RESULTS
morphological changes in response to retinoic acid treatment
five neuronal-like cell lines were tested for their capacity to mimic early events of neuronal determination and differentiation taking place during development or adult neurogenesis: d <dig> medulloblastoma , daoy , ntera- <dig> , pc- <dig> , sk-n-sh . additionally, hela cells  were chosen as non-neuronal control cell line. to differentiate cell lines towards a neuronal phenotype, retinoic acid  was added to the cultures.

pc- <dig> cells are known to undergo neuronal morphological differentiation in the presence of nerve growth factor . to confirm the potential of our pc- <dig> cultures to adopt a neuronal morphology upon differentiation, we maintained them four weeks in the presence of ngf . as previously described, pc <dig> cells underwent an extensive process outgrowth in response to ngf .

induction of early neuronal marker expression in response to retinoic acid
to examine if morphological changes observed in response to retinoic acid correlated with expression of genes induced during neuronal early differentiation, expression of dcx was assessed by immunocytochemistry. figure  <dig> shows the absence of dcx expression in undifferentiated cells from the six cell lines investigated. following differentiation however, robust expression of dcx could be detected in a large fraction of the ntera- <dig> cells, especially those forming the cell clusters . expression could also be detected at a low level in differentiated d <dig> cells . moreover, most neuronal-differentiated ntera- <dig> cells expressing dcx also induced expression of the neuronal-specific microtubule-binding protein map <dig>  hence revealing some degrees of neuronal maturation . in contrast, only a few dcx-expressing differentiated d <dig> cells did express map <dig>  finally, map <dig> expression could be detected in differentiated pc <dig> cells and rarely in hela cells as well, however, dcx expression could never be detected in these cell lines.

induction of dcx expression in response to retinoic acid
induction of dcx mrna expression following retinoic acid treatment was further quantified in total rna from each cell lines either in a proliferative state or following differentiation. in agreement with observation made by immunocytochemistry, undifferentiated cell lines did not express dcx, or did only in trace amounts . on the other hand, following retinoic acid-induced differentiation, levels of dcx mrna in ntera- <dig> cells were increased approximately  <dig> times. likewise, dcx mrna levels were approximately  <dig> times more elevated in differentiated d <dig> cells then in the non-differentiated cells. the absolute dcx mrna levels in d <dig> cells, however, were roughly half of those found in ntera- <dig> cells. finally, dcx mrna expression was not detected in the other differentiated cell lines.

to examine the induction of dcx expression in respect to other neuronal genes, we followed the expression of neurod <dig>  dcx and neuron-specific enolase  at various differentiation time points, i.e. proliferative state and following  <dig> days,  <dig> days,  <dig> days,  <dig> days and  <dig> days of retinoic acid treatment. as shown in figure 2o, retinoic acid treatment rapidly and transiently induced high levels of neurod <dig> expression, a neurogenic transcription factor  <cit> . as neurod <dig> expression declined between day  <dig> and  <dig> of differentiation, expression of dcx mrna was induced and further increased until the last time point at  <dig> days. finally, expression of nse mrna, an enzyme found in mature neurons  <cit> , was induced only after the third week of differentiation. hence, our differentiating ntera- <dig> cultures expressed a key neurogenic factor, a neuronal precursor marker, and a mature neuronal marker in successive phases. this suggests that differentiation of ntera- <dig> cells mimicked faithfully the various phases of the neuronal determination and differentiation program also induced in neural stem cells.

western blot analysis substantiated the induction of dcx expression measured at the mrna level. whereas, very low levels of dcx protein expression could be measured in proliferating ntera- <dig> cells, strong expression could be detected in differentiated ntera- <dig> cells . in addition, low levels of dcx protein expression could be detected in differentiated d <dig> cells , in agreement with the lower abundance of dcx mrna measured in these cells . the presence of dcx protein could not be documented in the other cells lines, notwithstanding their differentiation status.

expression of several neural markers in differentiating ntera- <dig> cells was scrutinized in more details by immunocytochemistry at various time points. as shown in figure 2p, within the first  <dig> days of exposition to retinoic acid, the expression a2b <dig>  a neural cell surface antigen, was induced in a large proportion of the cells, in agreement with previous report  <cit> . expression of nestin, an intermediate filament expressed in neural stem cells, was found in a high percentage of ntera- <dig> cells at all time points. nestin expression, however, decreased slowly during the course of differentiation. in contrast, ng <dig>  an antigen present on the cell surface of glial precursors, could not be detected in our ntera- <dig> cultures at any time point.

expression of neuronal markers became significant after  <dig> weeks of differentiation. hence, expression of Î²iii-tubulin, dcx and map <dig> were strongly induced and following  <dig> weeks of retinoic acid treatment, was found in more then 90% of the cells present in our ntera- <dig> cultures. expression of gfap was detected in a minor fraction of the ntera- <dig> cells at every time point. finally, expression of neun, a marker found in more mature neurons, could not be detected using our differentiation paradigm.

in vitro model of neuronal determination
this capacity of differentiating ntera- <dig> cells to induce expression of the dcx gene was further exploited to establish an in vitro reporter system for neuronal early differentiation events. we recently reported that a genomic fragment of  <dig>  kb of the human dcx gene drove expression of reporter genes in neuronal precursors and young neurons in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . we therefore generated stable ntera- <dig> cell lines bearing the egfp or the firefly luciferase reporter gene under the control of the dcx promoter sequences . in parallel, we also generated transfected hela cell lines  as non-neuronal controls. integration of the reporter construct was confirmed by pcr on the genomic dna .

whereas undifferentiated ntera-2dcx-egfp and heladcx-egfp did not express the egfp reporter, retinoic acid treatment strongly and specifically induced the expression of egfp in the ntera-2dcx-egfp cells but not in the heladcx-egfp cells . immunocytochemistry further confirmed that egfp-expressing cells also expressed dcx, and frequently map <dig> as well .

the induction of the reporter gene in differentiating ntera- <dig> cells was examined at the mrna and protein levels. in agreement with the strong induction of the endogenous dcx mrna expression following differentiation of ntera-2dcx-egfp cells, expression of the egfp reporter mrna was observed to be strongly induced . in contrast, heladcx-egfp did not upregulated the expression of the egfp reporter in response to retinoic acid treatment. the potent induction of the reporter's expression in ntera- <dig> cells could also be documented by western blotting . again, as expected from the mrna measurements, expression of the reporter was not induced in heladcx-egfp cells, underscoring the neuronal specificity of the reporter system.

neurogenin  <dig> and neurogenin  <dig>  are transcription factors of the basic helix-loop-helix  family expressed in the earliest steps of mammalian cortical neurogenesis. they initiate a cascade of gene activation leading to the expression of terminal neuronal differentiation genes  <cit> . it was recently reported that mouse ngn <dig> could bind directly on the dcx promoter and activate it  <cit> . the capacity of our reporter system to respond to neurogenic factors was tested using a mouse ngn2-encoding vector to transiently transfect the ntera-2dcx-luci cells. heladcx-luci cell were used in parallel as a non-neuronal control. as shown in figure 3o, brief expression of mouse ngn <dig> for as little as four days sufficed to activate dcx-promoter driven expression of the luciferase reporter gene in ntera- <dig> cells, but not in hela cells.

discussion
over the last few years, dcx became an established marker for neuronal determination and neurogenesis  <cit> . in differentiating neural stem cells, either in vivo or in vitro, expression of dcx can be detected upon induction of neuronal differentiation. to date however, no established neural cell line was shown to have the capacity to up-regulate dcx upon differentiation. in this report, we show that ntera- <dig> cells in conjunction with dcx reporter constructs constitute an attractive model for the study of early phases of neuronal differentiation occurring during developmental and adult neurogenesis. although, ultimate validation of factors acting on neuronal differentiation would need to be performed on primary cells, there was a need for such an in vitro system behaving as a simple neuronal differentiation model.

in contrast to other neural cell lines tested, such as pc <dig> cells, ntera- <dig> and d <dig> cells could induce expression of dcx mrna in response to retinoic acid exposure, a treatment known to induce a strong neurogenic response . at the protein level however, only differentiated ntera- <dig> cells showed significant dcx expression. expression of dcx in ntera- <dig> cells was associated with the establishment of a neuronal morphology, as well as with the expression of other neuronal-specific markers, such as map <dig> and nse.

dcx expression occurs very early during the neuronal determination/differentiation process, possibly due to the direct binding of the bhlh transcription factors such as ngn <dig> on the dcx promoter  <cit> . hence, it appears that differentiating ntera- <dig> cells can mimic neural stem cells in the early phase of neuronal differentiation. supporting data also come from a recent gene profiling of ntera- <dig> cells treated with retinoic acid. the latter revealed an expression pattern compatible with early neuronal phenotypes found in the posterior hindbrain and other posterior cns regions  <cit> . therefore, ntera- <dig> cells appear to be well suited to be used as an in vitro model to study the early events of neuronal determination/differentiation and the factors influencing it.

in addition, we showed that genetically modified ntera- <dig> cells bearing reporter genes under the control of the human dcx promoter constitute a simple and valuable tool to study factors acting on neuronal determination and early differentiation. we have previously demonstrated that dcx promoter-based expression vectors can drive expression of reporter genes in neuronal precursors and young neurons, both in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . the fact that reporter expression was not induced in hela cells further supports the evidence that expression of dcx promoter-based construct in ntera- <dig> cells accurately reflects the induction of a complex genetic program similar to the early phase of neural stem cells differentiation into neurons, and not merely a cis-action on the dcx promoter.

CONCLUSIONS
we could demonstrate in this report that expression of dcx and dcx promoter-driven reporters occurred in ntera- <dig> cells upon induction of neuronal differentiation. through this new and simple reporter system tool, it will be possible to analyze early events of neuronal determination and differentiation such as occurring during development and adult neurogenesis and identified new neurons directly in statu nascendi. moreover, this culture model also provides a rapid screening method for molecules influencing the early process of neuronal differentiation.
