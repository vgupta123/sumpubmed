BACKGROUND
comparative analyses of the vocal behavior of nonhuman primates and humans have allowed to identify the derived features of the human language faculty, such as volitional control over vocal production, symbolic understanding, and recursion  <cit> . moreover, screening studies have revealed the association of a series of genes with specific language disorders  <cit> . advances in genetic engineering now allow the study of particular genes associated with language disorders in mouse models  <cit> . mouse ultrasonic vocalizations  are the target variable in many of these studies; they also turned out to be a valuable readout in studies addressing the genetic foundation of social behavior  <cit> . the interest in mice as model for vocal learning was further spurred by the finding that adult male mice produce elaborate ultrasonic 'songs' in encounters with females, implying that learning might play a role in the ontogenetic development of these vocalizations  <cit> . a cross-fostering study on c57bl/ <dig> and balb/c mice however showed that males kept singing songs with the typical characteristics of their genetic parents, both in terms of the acoustic structure and temporal characteristics  <cit> . on the other hand, a developmental study on cba/caj mice revealed substantial changes in their vocalizations with age  <cit> , but it remained unclear to which extent learning is involved in these developmental changes. clarifying this question is essential to judge the suitability of mice models for specific developmental and evolutionary, as well as clinical studies.

to shed light on the question whether mice require auditory input of their own species-specific vocalizations for a normal development of their calls, we analyzed the recordings of calls from mice that serve as a model of human deafness dfnb <dig>  these mice have deficits in otoferlin, a synaptic vesicle protein at the cochlear inner hair cell  <cit> . vesicle exocytosis is disrupted in animals lacking otoferlin, resulting in profound deafness  <cit> . we recorded pup's isolation calls before and after they reached hearing ability. previous studies showed that neonatal mice are deaf and they only begin to hear at an age of approximately 10- <dig> days  <cit> . in addition, we recorded songs of deaf and normally hearing adult males during their courtship encounters. if mice fall within the pattern of most terrestrial mammals, they should not require auditory input for species-specific vocal development  <cit> . all terrestrial mammals seem to lack the ability of vocal production learning, with the exception of elephants  <cit> . in case mice have developed the ability of vocal production learning, we expected to find significant differences between deaf and hearing mice. in case that auditory input is essential, deaf mice should produce structurally altered calls after hearing onset.

RESULTS
pup isolation calls
the number of calls given by isolated pups increased from p4- <dig> to p8- <dig> and then decreased again at p15- <dig> . accordingly, we found significant variation in relation to age , but no significant differences between deaf and normally hearing animals , and no significant interaction .

the two-step cluster analysis identified a two cluster solution as the best categorization of pup isolation calls, which is equivalent to a vocal repertoire of two  call types . cluster  <dig>  encompassed  <dig> % and is defined by calls with high sudden frequency jumps ), high maximum peak frequency  and a long call duration . the second cluster  consisted of calls with shorter call duration . it was not possible to establish reliable categories in relation to the modulation of the peak frequency, i.e. whether it is descending, flat or ascending. exemplary spectrograms of ct <dig> and ct <dig> are presented in figure 2a.

we next conducted a discriminant function analysis  to distinguish between calls given by otof knock-out or control subjects. while the dfa assigned  <dig> % of the calls to the correct call type , it was not possible to assign calls in relation to the pups' hearing ability .

the analysis of the acoustic properties of calls revealed significant age-related changes in nearly all acoustic parameters of ct <dig>  and in a few acoustic parameters of ct <dig>  importantly, we found no significant differences in relation to the hearing ability of the pups or their mothers . because mouse pups do not begin to hear before postnatal day  <dig> we conducted a separate analysis for p15- <dig>  in line with the above results, we found no significant differences in the acoustic structure between deaf and normally hearing mice .

male mouse courtship vocalizations
deaf males tended to produce a higher number of calls than normally hearing ones during their courtship encounters . we found no significant differences in the latency to call  or in the mean interval duration measured from the start of the call to the start of the subsequent call .

a two-step cluster analysis identified a three cluster solution as the best possible solution. cluster  <dig>  is defined by high sudden frequency jumps ), a high maximum peak frequency  and a long call duration . the second cluster  consisted of calls with a descending or flat peak frequency , and mean call duration . the third call cluster  contained calls with increasing peak frequency  and a short call duration . exemplary spectrograms are presented in figure 2b. in total,  <dig> % of male courtship vocalization belonged to ct <dig>   <dig> % to ct <dig>  and  <dig> % to ct <dig> 

the dfa assigned  <dig> % of the calls to the correct call type , but only  <dig> % of calls  to the correct category in relation to hearing ability. along the same lines, we found no significant differences in the structure of call types between deaf and normally hearing males . to ensure that the results of the statistical analyses are not simply an artifact by the chosen number of call types, we repeated the statistical analyses for different cluster solutions. the choice of a varying number of clusters did not affect the results .

discussion
we found no significant differences in calling rate or acoustic structure of mouse ultrasonic vocalizations in relation to hearing ability. this was true for pup isolations calls as well as adult male 'courtship songs'. the ontogenetic changes found in both deaf and hearing pups are similar to those reported for other hearing strains  <cit> . apparently, auditory experience is not a prerequisite for the normal development of species-specific vocalizations in mice.

our results are in line with findings on cross-fostered male mice courtship songs. cross-fostered male mice did not adapt the sound characteristic of their social parents, but produced sound sequences with the acoustic structure and temporal pattern typical of their genetic parents  <cit> . other studies which suggested that learning might have an influence on the development of male song structure, had demonstrated developmental changes  <cit>  and a high complexity of male songs  <cit> . however, neither criterion is a demonstration of learning per se. alternatively, developmental changes may be attributed to maturation, while complexity could be an outcome of selective pressures or simply be a by-product of nonlinear phenomena in sound production  <cit> .

while we found no differences in relation to hearing ability within our mouse strain, there is now evidence accumulating that genetic differences between mouse strains may affect calling rate, call duration and frequency characteristics of isolation calls  <cit> . mice homozygous for non-functional foxp <dig> alleles produced significantly fewer isolation calls than their wild-type littermates, whereas heterozygous mouse pups produced nearly the same amount of vocalizations as their wild-type littermates  <cit> . however, homozygous mouse pups exhibit severe developmental deficits and die around  <dig> weeks after birth, implying that the reduction in ultrasonic vocalization might not represent specific effects of foxp <dig> on these vocalizations  <cit> . in addition heterozygous mouse pups did not differ significantly from wild-types in the structure of their ultrasounds  <cit> , implying that functional foxp <dig> alleles are not important for the production of species-specific ultrasounds as long as a normal development is guaranteed. in addition, androgenic hormones can have a profound influence on male courtship vocalizations  <cit> . further, it was shown that different kinds of female odors lead to significant changes in the structure of courtship vocalization  <cit> . in sum, both genetic and environmental features may alter the occurrence and structure of mouse usvs, but auditory input does not appear to play a substantial role. it seems promising though to study the influence of hearing on the development of social behavior. vocalizations have an important function in regulating the social relationships between animals, and it seems probable that deaf mice develop disrupted social relationships.

a critical issue of studies revealing no differences between categories is the question whether the used method is adequate to reveal possible differences. the discriminant function analysis has a long history in bioacoustics research and had regular shown that this procedure is able to detect subtle differences. a recent example is a study on crested gibbons where the authors found subtle differences in songs of close related populations, which are not detectable by ear  <cit> . a second study on chiffchaff calls is a good example because the call structure of these calls is comparable to the whistle like structure of mouse ultrasounds. the discriminant function analyses revealed the individual signature as well as micro-geographical variation among the different recording sites  <cit> . in both cases the correct assignment was above 90% with chance levels around 5%. in our study the correct assignment to deaf and normal hearing mice was app. 55% and a change level of 50%. there are many other studies showing that a discriminant function analysis is a powerful tool to reveal existing differences. a further critical issue of the present study may be the low number of call categories revealed by the acoustic analysis. this number, however, was based on a reproducible procedure which determines the optimal number of clusters by comparing different solutions using the bayesian information criterion . moreover, using cluster solutions with higher number of categories did not affect the results . notably, increasing the number of clusters leads to the occurrence of call types that are produced by one individual only. in other words, apart from the general call types identified with the current procedure, the remaining variation is largely due to individual differences but not to sub-categories that can be found across individuals.

taken together, our results suggest that neither exposure to auditory input from others, nor auditory feedback of the subject's own vocalizations is important for the development of species-specific vocalizations. auditory experience with the species-specific vocalizations as well as auditory feed-back was shown to be important in human speech  <cit>  and bird song  <cit> , both learned modes of production. therefore, it is questionable whether mice constitute a suitable model to study the genetic foundation of vocal learning.

CONCLUSIONS
deaf mice revealed the same ontogenetic development in terms of the number, usage and structure of their pup vocalizations as their hearing conspecifics. similarly, there were no differences in male courtship songs in relation to hearing ability. apparently, mice do not require auditory input for normal vocal development. these findings question the utility of mouse models to elucidate the foundations of vocal learning, a key component in the development of human speech. nevertheless, ultrasonic vocalizations of mice constitute a valuable readout in studies of the genetic foundations of social and communicative behavior, such as autism spectrum disorders  <cit> .
