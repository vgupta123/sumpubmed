BACKGROUND
numerous studies have shown that cancer involve accumulated genetic aberrations in the cell. advances in dna microarray technology have revolutionized cancer research by enabling, within a given cell population, the simultaneous monitoring of the transcription and complex changes in the expression of thousands of genes during cancer development. this makes rapid genetic analysis for genome-wide cancer studies feasible. researchers can quickly compare gene expressions between normal and malignant cells, and explore the genetic changes associated with cancer etiology and development. microarray analysis offers promising avenues to the discovery of both new biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis and new treatments. microarray data are being used to categorize tumors on the basis of their molecular profiles, to identify subtypes of tumors, to predict patients' responses to treatment and risk of relapse, and to explore the biological properties of tumors  <cit> .

recent cancer research has applied a variety of machine learning algorithms for tumor prediction by associating expression patterns with clinical outcomes for patients with tumors in various stages  <cit> . due to the distinctive huge dimensionality of the data, the majority of research has focused on building accurate classification models from reduced sets of features. the analysis aims to gain understanding of the differences between normal and malignant cells and to identify genes that are differentially regulated during cancer development. while this is useful, when classification models are not 100% accurate, the likelihoods of correctness for the class predictions  can be useful for further research . for example, some of the genetic abnormalities in malignant cells may be the most important contributing factors for cancer. classification ranking is a challenging problem, particularly in microarray data, which has a huge number of factors whose relative importance is largely unknown. most machine learners focus on classification and do not explicitly assess the likelihood of correctness for their class predictions, unless additional analysis is performed.

this paper describes a simple microarray data analysis technique for tumor classification ranking. in particular, we apply mdr, our recently developed multi-dimensional ranking algorithm, for analyzing gene expression in various types of cancers including leukemia, lung, prostate, lymphoma, and breast cancers. these data have been used in previous cancer research studies  <cit> . they are publicly available and can be obtained from the kent ridge biomedical data set repository  <cit> .

RESULTS
we analyze microarray data for  <dig> types and subtypes of tumors using mdr. the two leukemia expression data sets are concerned with classification of acute lymphoblastic leukemia . golub et al.  <cit>  used the all-aml leukemia expressions to help discover a single diagnostic test to differentiate between two types of human acute leukemia: acute myeloid leukemia  and all. the all-subtype expression data were used by yeoh et al.  <cit>  to identify six known prognostically important leukemia subtypes of all from pediatric all patients. these all subtypes include: bcr-abl, e2a-pbx <dig>  hyperdiploid >  <dig> chromosomes, mall, t-all, and tel-aml <dig>  because different leukemia types and subtypes respond to chemotherapy differently, the ability to determine the classification of an all subtype for a new leukemia tissue sample can be valuable for cancer treatment. mdr has been designed for binary classification ranking. when dealing with multiple classes, we employ the "one against many" strategy . as recommended in a recent study by li and liu  <cit> , we divide the all-subtype expression data into six cases, each of which focuses on classification of a particular all subtype against all the other subtypes. the all classification model  obtained from mdr contains two predictor genes, whereas the number of predictor genes in the classifiers for the six all subtypes ranges from one to nine. this is a huge reduction from the original number of genes, over  <dig> , in the all-aml and all subtype expression data.

the lung cancer data are analyzed to distinguish between malignant pleural mesothelioma  and adenocarcinoma   <cit> , whereas the prostate and breast profile expression data are analyzed for tumor diagnosis and prognosis , respectively  <cit> . the lymphoma microarray data include gene expressions of diffuse large b-cell lymphoma, a subtype of non-hodgkin's lymphoma  <cit> . to indicate different stages of b-cell malignancies, gene expression patterns studied are of two types: the germinal centre b-like type and the activated b-like type. patients with the germinal centre b-like type have had better survival rates. the classification models obtained by mdr from the lung, prostate, lymphoma and breast expression data contain five, six, three and eight predictor genes, respectively. the predictor genes in each of these mdr classification models, derived from the corresponding expression data sets, are shown in table  <dig>  while constructing the classification model, mdr reduces the number of data dimensions to a smaller number, selecting features relevant for classification ranking in the model. unlike the machine learners that require an additional step for feature selection, mdr does not do feature selection as a separate step. mdr could be viewed as an alternative, simple method for a boosting-based feature selection technique. however, proper verification of mdr's effectiveness as a method for feature selection would require research beyond the scope of this paper.

the performance of mdr is compared to that of other high performance machine learners in weka  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows a comparison of roc curves obtained from mdr and five other learners  for the prostate cancer data set. the zeror learner predicts values based on the majority of the class distribution and is commonly used as a baseline measure of performance. as expected, zeror shows performance equivalent to random guessing, giving an roc curve close to a diagonal line. therefore, it has no predictive power. the roc curves obtained from c <dig>  and bayes show better performance than zeror. the top three performers appear to be mdr, 3nn and svm. both mdr and svm dominate the others but we cannot draw a firm conclusion on comparative performance by looking at the roc curve alone. while the roc curve is effective for ranking quality, it is not always conclusive. thus, our analysis employs alternative standard performance measures , including recall , fpr , fnr , acc , auc  and precision. the results of these measures  obtained from six learners are given in table  <dig>  for the classification of five types of cancer, and table  <dig>  for the classification of six subtypes of acute lymphoblastic leukemia .

consider the results shown in table  <dig>  for prostate cancer, the aucs obtained by all the learners are consistent with the observations from the roc curves shown in figure  <dig>  but now we can make conclusive comparisons. based on auc, mdr, at  <dig> %, and is slightly better than svm, 91%. however, when considering all other measures, svm generally performs better than mdr with differences of no more than  <dig> %. auc ranks the results differently than the other measures because it is a more suitable measure for ranking evaluation. nevertheless, mdr outperforms 3nn by larger differences  and about 5% in auc, recall and fnr ). both the accuracies and aucs obtained from c <dig>  and bayes are much lower than those of mdr. for prostate cancer classification, mdr can rank well  while its classification quality remains competitive with the other learners .

for all-aml leukemia, the top three performers are svm, bayes and mdr. all have the same fpr of 4%. svm and bayes have the highest recall, accuracy, precision and the lowest fnr. however, mdr has the best auc of  <dig> %, and the second best values for the other measures, with precision lower by only  <dig> %, accuracy lower by about 1%, and differences in fnr and recall of about 2%. this is similar to the results obtained in prostate cancer. however, here svm and bayes give highly competitive results in all measures except auc. on the other hand, mdr has reasonably high precision, accuracy and recall . mdr performs very well on the classification ranking of all. mdr's performance on lung cancer is similar to its performance on lymphoma cancer. for lung cancer, svm, bayes and mdr consistently performed better than the rest. the auc and acc obtained by mdr were  <dig> % and  <dig> % lower than those of the top performer, but it still has over 90% on almost all measures, with a low 2% fpr. unfortunately, the  <dig> % for fnr obtained by mdr is rather high, but still better than the  <dig> % and  <dig> % of c <dig>  and 3nn, respectively. in the lymphoma cancer analysis, bayes and svm are top performers, followed by mdr. the auc for mdr is  <dig> %, which is  <dig> % lower than that of bayes and svm. compared to mdr, 3nn has  <dig> % lower fpr  but  <dig> % higher fnr , which is usually a more critical measure for tumor prediction. the acc and auc obtained by c <dig>  and 3nn are not competitive to those obtained by mdr.

all the machine learners had poor results for the breast cancer data. furthermore, the results obtained from different measures are not consistent. for example, bayes has 100% precision but very low auc and acc of only about 50â€“55%, and an extremely high type ii error of about 95%. this suggests that the data are probably very skewed. the results obtained from svm are the best with auc, acc and recall all close to 70%. however, its precision is only 65%, and it has very high type i & ii errors of about 30%. mdr does not perform well. nevertheless, the majority of its results rank second best among all the learners. we now discuss the results obtained in the all subtype classification as shown in table  <dig>  for the classification of subtypes e2a-pbx <dig> and t-all, mdr has perfect averages in all measures. for the subtype bcr-abl, although mdr has the highest auc,  <dig> %, and high accuracy,  <dig> %, , it has low precision, low recall, and high fnr, about 80%. the results obtained by the other learners also show similar inconsistency across different measures. thus, for bcr-abl classification, all learners are likely to perform well but with high variances. for the rest of the all subtypes: hyperdiploid >  <dig> chromosomes , mall and tel-aml <dig>  the results are similar in that the top three performers are svm, 3nn, and c <dig>  on almost all measures except auc. however, mdr gives reasonably high accuracy, ranging from 80% to 93%, and auc ranging from 85% to 91%. since auc is the area under the roc curve, which is a plot between tpr and fpr, it may seem strange that a lower tpr and higher fpr can yield a higher auc. however, this is possible when multiple points on the curve are considered . this is why auc is one of the most widely used measures for evaluating probabilistic classification models  <cit> .

to better understand mdr's performance for various types of cancer microarray data analyses, table  <dig> focuses on comparisons of auc in average percentages over 10-fold cross validations. for each type and subtype of tumor classification, the base line performance  gives an average auc ranging from  <dig> % to  <dig> %. this follows the expected behavior of the roc no-discrimination line, which implies that there is about 50% chance that a randomly selected sample of a target class  has a higher estimated probability of being predicted than a randomly selected sample from a non-target class . for each data set, table  <dig> shows the highest auc in bold. mdr gives the highest auc for the classifications of all-aml and prostate, and four all subtypes: bcr-abl, e2a-pbx <dig>  mall and tall. svm gives the highest aucs for the rest. in the former group of classifications, svm underperforms mdr with auc differences ranging from 1% to  <dig> %, whereas in the latter group, mdr underperforms svm with auc differences ranging from  <dig> % to  <dig> %. specifically, svm does poorly in bcr-abl with an auc  <dig> % lower than the best auc, obtained by mdr, whereas mdr has the largest auc difference in subtype hyp >  <dig> with an auc  <dig> % lower than that of svm, the best performer. for the lymphoma cancer, svm ties with bayes for the best auc,  <dig> %, while mdr is competitive with an auc of  <dig> %. for classification of subtypes e2a-pbx <dig>  mdr and c <dig>  both have an auc of 100%. neither mdr nor svm perform well on breast cancer, with aucs of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. in terms of overall average aucs, svm and mdr outperform the other learners. mdr performs best on six of the eleven classification test cases and has an average auc over all eleven cases of  <dig> %. the overall average auc obtained from svm is  <dig> %, and svm has the best performance for five of the data sets. however, the difference between the average aucs of mdr and svm is not statistically significant.

therefore, we can conclude that mdr is at least competitive to the other learners. in addition, recall that mdr provides the additional information of ranking predictions. we note that, unlike other learners, the auc obtained from weka for svm is based on an roc curve created using a single point . since svm is a binary classifier that is not designed for classification ranking, this may seem to be a reasonable way to estimate auc. however, this method may result in an optimistic auc for svm whenever svm has high accuracy. another observation is that mdr's performance may associate with the class distribution in the sample data. when the class distribution is extremely unbalanced, mdr does better than other learners. for example, in all subtype classifications of all, for which mdr outperformed other learners, the proportion of the target class is at most 15%. in particular, the proportions of the target class for subtypes bcr-abl, e2a-pbx <dig>  mall and t-all are  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. to further compare the performance of mdr and svm, we ran additional experiments  with the tis  data obtained from  <cit> . although these are vertebrate genomic sequences and not gene expression data, the tis data set differs from all of the above expression data sets in that it has a much higher number of instances  than the number of attributes  with a class distribution ratio of about 25%. our results show that while both svm and mdr give the same auc of  <dig> , the training time of svm is  <dig>  sec., which is significantly higher than mdr's training time of  <dig>  sec. this shows that svm is suitable for high dimensional data while mdr appears to be robust for data with high dimension and volume.

CONCLUSIONS
this paper investigates the potential of mdr, a recently developed ranking algorithm, for obtaining effective and informative tumor classifications from gene expression data. mdr gives promising results with an average auc of  <dig> % and accuracy of  <dig> % over  <dig> types and subtypes of cancers. the results show that mdr is competitive with other widely used high performance machine learners for microarray data analysis. based on our experiments, mdr appears to be robust to unbalanced data and performs well even when the tumor class distribution is extremely unbalanced. in addition, mdr provides explicit assessment of classification rankings. mdr's accuracy in classifying different types of tumor is relatively high  on all types of cancer except breast cancer, where the accuracy and auc obtained by mdr are about 63%. however, even svm, which is the top performer for breast cancer, has accuracy and auc of only about 68%. this implies that the breast cancer data used for the analysis may not have the structure and patterns that allow types of tumors to be discriminated. mdr performed very well on classifying all six subtypes of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, with the classification for subtype hyp >  <dig> being the least accurate. our work is preliminary and has been validated only on a limited number of data sets. future work could include an investigation on the effects of the number of boosting rounds required by mdr during training, fine-tuning and experimentation with additional data sets to see how tolerant mdr is to noisy and inconsistent data. further interpretation of the results obtained from mdr is required. furthermore, since mdr can be viewed as a feature selection tool that is very simple and fast, it would be interesting to see if mdr can be applied for this purpose. these issues are part of our ongoing research.
