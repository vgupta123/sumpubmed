BACKGROUND
enterobacter sakazakii is an emergent pathogen that is associated with neonatal infection  <cit> . most reported outbreaks have occurred in neonatal intensive care units and some have been linked to the ingestion of contaminated powdered infant milk formula  <cit> .

e. sakazakii was defined as a new species by farmer et al.  <dig>  using dna-dna hybridization the previously 'yellow pigmented enterobacter cloacae' was shown to be 41–54% related to enterobacter and citrobacter species. farmer et al.  <cit>  described  <dig> biogroups of e. sakazakii based on biochemical profiles with the wild type biogroup  <dig> being the most common. since  <dig> prokaryotic systematics has changed with the increasing use of 16s rdna sequence analysis  <cit> . harada and ishikawa  <cit>  used dna sequence analysis of the groel operon to determine the phylogenetic relationship among enterobacter, pantoea, klebsiella, serratia and erwinia species. hoffmann and roggenkamp  <cit>  used hsp <dig>  dna sequence variation to investigate e. cloacae polyphyletic groups. previously, it has been shown by both partial 16s rdna and hsp <dig> gene sequencing that isolates identified as e. sakazakii using commercial identification kits form at least four distinct clusters  <cit> . recently, an artificial neural network has been published which identified key biochemical and 16s rdna sequences that distinguish e. sakazakii from closely related organisms  <cit> .

in this study, we compare the biogroups of  <dig> strains with the four 16s rdna cluster groups. we also identified key biochemical characteristics for the differentiation of these four genotypes. this significantly extends the previous work of farmer et al.  <cit> , which used five strains to genetically define the species and a total of  <dig> strains to define biogroups.

RESULTS
biogroups
the biochemical profiles obtained for each strain were compared to the biogroups originally described by farmer et al  <cit> . clinical strains were distributed among fourteen of the biogroups . the defining tests were motility, voges-proskauer, methyl red, indole, ornithine decarboxylase, reduction of nitrate to nitrite, production of gas from d-glucose, malonate utilization and production of acid from myo-inositol and dulcitol. where strains could not be assigned to an original biogroup, a new biogroup or subgroup was designated . the majority of isolates  were in biogroup  <dig> with the e. sakazakii atcc 29544t type strain. these strains were motile, produced gas from glucose, produced acid from inositol, reduced nitrate and were positive for voges-proskauer and ornithine decarboxylase, but negative for methyl red, indole, malonate utilization and acid production from dulcitol. biogroup  <dig>  contained isolates negative for acid production from inositol; four of these were also non-motile. biogroup  <dig>  contained six strains and biogroup  <dig>  contained nine strains three of which were non-motile. biogroup  <dig>  was positive for malonate utilization and six of these were non-motile. biogroup  <dig>  was positive for indole and biogroup  <dig>  was negative for gas production from glucose. biogroup  <dig>  was defined by the inability to reduce nitrate. two of these  <dig> strains were positive in the malonate test, three were negative for the inositol test and two were inositol negative but malonate positive. biogroup  <dig> contained  <dig> strains that were inositol negative and malonate positive. biogroup  <dig> contained one strain that was inositol negative and indole positive, while biogroup  <dig> contained one strain that was inositol negative and dulcitol positive. biogroup  <dig> was also represented by only one strain, which was indole and malonate positive. the seven isolates in biogroup  <dig> were negative for the voges-proskauer reaction, three were non-motile, one was negative for methyl red and one was negative for ornithine. biogroup  <dig>  was negative for ornithine decarboxylase and inositol, with four of these strains being positive for malonate. biogroup  <dig> was positive for all the tests performed except methyl red. a new group  had to be defined to accommodate  <dig> strains which were inositol and dulcitol positive, but indole negative. they were malonate positive, with the exception of one strain. two strains were non-motile and one of these was also ornithine decarboxylase negative. acid production from α-methyl-d-glucoside was included in the original study  <cit>  and all biogroups were reported positive for this trait with the exception of biogroup  <dig>  as biogroup  <dig> could be distinguished from the other biogroups without the α-methyl-d-glucoside test, this was not repeated for all strains in this study.

phylogenetic analysis
partial 16s rdna sequences  containing less than 1% undetermined positions were obtained for all strains in this study. the sequences were analysed using the maximum parsimony method, which is an evolutionary model that searches for the simplest tree that can be constructed using the fewest inferred changes between characters. the topology was optimised using simulated annealing, a heuristic that occasionally accepts a worse tree during the course of the search allowing it to escape local optima. this method is more economical than the more usual heuristic searches , which can require many randon re-starts, especially with large data matrices  <cit> . in agreement with previous reports  <cit> , the isolates used in this study were divided into four genomic groups by 16s rdna sequence analysis . the majority  of the presumptive e. sakazakii isolates in this study clustered with the type strain . cluster  <dig> was composed of the majority of biogroups, biogroups 1– <dig>  7– <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the  <dig> isolates forming the new proposed biogroup  <dig> corresponded with e. sakazakii cluster  <dig> , with between  <dig> – <dig> % 16s rdna sequence difference from the e. sakazakii type strain. no strains representative of this biochemical profile were included in the original study by farmer et al.  <cit> .

the six isolates in biogroup  <dig> corresponded to e. sakazakii cluster  <dig> . the four strains described as e. sakazakii cluster  <dig>  represent biogroups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  for this dataset, the four partial 16s rdna cluster groups can be distinguished biochemically using the indole, dulcitol, and inositol tests . cluster  <dig> strains are variable for inositol, negative for indole, and dulcitol; with the exception of biogroup  <dig>  which is dulcitol positive and inositol negative. cluster  <dig> – biogroup  <dig> strains are positive for inositol and dulcitol but negative for indole. cluster  <dig> – biogroup  <dig> is positive for inositol, dulcitol and indole. cluster  <dig> strains were also positive for indole but can be distinguished from cluster  <dig> as they are negative for dulcitol. one of the strains in cluster  <dig> was inositol negative  and one was malonate positive . there were insufficient isolates in cluster  <dig> biogroups to determine whether these biogroups could be further genomically divided.

discussion
farmer et al.  <cit>  described  <dig> biogroups of  <dig> strains of e. sakazakii. five strains were used to genetically define the species by dna-dna hybridization and the remaining strain definitions were phenotypic. this study defines isolates in terms of both phenotype and genotype and extends the initial  <dig>  <cit>  study with the analysis of  <dig> strains. according to partial 16s rdna sequence analysis the majority of e. sakazakii strains clustered with the type strain , and within this cluster there was no clear further genomic division corresponding to biogroup. a second cluster of closely related strains was identified  which were biochemically distinct from cluster  <dig> and formed a biogroup that had not been previously described by farmer et al  <cit> . these strains were not assigned a species match using the microseq  <dig> or supplemental bacterial databases, but the nearest match was e. sakazakii . biogroup  <dig>  <cit>  corresponds to e. sakazakii cluster  <dig>  while biogroups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> correspond to e. sakazakii cluster  <dig>  <cit> .

analysis of the full 16s sequence of strains corresponding to cluster groups  <dig>   <cit>  and  <dig>   <cit>  show these are less than 3% divergent from cluster group  <dig>  although dna-dna hybridization is the acknowledged standard for species delineation this technique was beyond the scope of this study, which focuses on evaluation of the biogroups reported when e. sakazakii was originally described. as well as defining a new biogroup , this study found  <dig> subgroups within the original biogroups. the malonate and motility tests account for the majority of the subdivisions of the original biogroups.

in this study, the majority of food isolates belonged to biogroups  <dig> and  <dig>  all biogroups except  <dig> and  <dig> contained at least one strain from a clinical source. the greatest number of clinical strains  was found to belong to biogroup  <dig> . however, this included  <dig> isolates out of the ten from the same hospital. therefore this may not be an indication of increased pathogenicity of this biogroup, but is likely due to an over representation of one clonal type from a single source. most of the food isolates  belonged to biogroups  <dig> and  <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
biogroup  <dig> was the major group with approximately one third of the e. sakazakii strains . cluster  <dig> was the major dna cluster , and was composed of biogroups 1– <dig>  7– <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  cluster  <dig> is equivalent to biogroup  <dig>  and a new biogroup  <dig> was designated for the strains in cluster  <dig>  for this dataset it is possible to differentiate the four genomic clusters using indole, dulcitol and inositol tests.
