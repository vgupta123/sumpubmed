BACKGROUND
ctbp proteins were originally identified as c-terminal binding proteins of type 2/ <dig> adenovirus e1a proteins  <cit> . they function primarily in the nucleus as transcriptional co-repressors, modulating the activity of a large number of transcriptional repressors via recruitment of chromatin modifiers such as histone deacetylases, histone methyltransferases and polycomb proteins  <cit> , and sequestration of histone acetyltransferases  <cit> . ctbp proteins also play a role in the cytoplasm in regulating mitotic golgi membrane fissioning  <cit> , and also associate with centrosomes during mitosis  <cit> . ctbp proteins have been implicated in tumorigenesis, as their interaction with the c-terminus of e1a is essential for immortalisation of primary rodent cells, and also negatively regulates e1a-mediated transformation, tumorigenicity and metastasis  <cit> . in addition, many transcriptional repressors regulated by ctbps are involved in pathways associated with tumorigenesis, including tgf-β and wnt signalling pathways and cell cycle regulators such as rb/p <dig> and hdm <dig>  <cit> . presumably, as a consequence of disruption of some of these critical functions, inhibition of ctbp expression in cancer cells can result in apoptosis  <cit> ; reviewed in  <cit> .

humans possess two ctbp gene loci, ctbp <dig> and ctbp <dig>  ctbp <dig> and ctbp <dig> proteins share 78% amino acid identity and 83% similarity  <cit> . alternate promoter usage and gene splicing from the ctbp <dig> locus generates ribeye, a retina-specific ctbp <dig> variant  <cit> . the ctbp <dig> locus also similarly encodes a ctbp <dig> variant with an alternate n-terminus, variously described as ctbp <dig>  bars or ctbp1-s  <cit> . the primary protein products, ctbp <dig> and ctbp <dig>  both contain a conserved n-terminal domain involved in the binding of transcription factors possessing a consensus pxdls peptide motif, and a central dehydrogenase homology domain that has a number of functions, including dimerisation. ctbp <dig> and ctbp <dig> appear to function interchangeably, at least in terms of their role as transcriptional co-repressors, but evidence is emerging that they are subject to differential transcriptional and post-translational regulation .

control of subcellular localisation is emerging as an important mechanism whereby ctbp <dig> function is regulated. for example, phosphorylation of ctbp <dig> at ser <dig> by p21-activated kinase  <dig>  results in cytoplasmic localisation and inhibition of its corepressor activity under certain growth conditions  <cit> . certain pxdls-containing transcriptional repressors are able to recruit ctbp <dig> to the nucleus, such as ets family member net  <cit>  and the tumour suppressor protein hic <dig>  <cit> . ctbp <dig> is modified by sumoylation at k <dig>  which, in conjunction with protein-protein interactions involving its c-terminal pdz-binding domain  <cit> , regulates its nuclear localisation  <cit> . ctbp <dig> lacks both this sumoylation site and the pdz-binding domain, indicating that its subcellular localisation is likely to be regulated in a different manner to ctbp <dig>  we therefore examined the primary sequence of ctbp <dig> to look for alternative sequence motifs that could be involved in the regulation of its localisation. this analysis identified a putative, evolutionarily conserved nuclear localisation signal , which has recently been shown to be functional in promoting the nuclear accumulation of ctbp <dig>   <cit>  though it has been shown to function in nuclear retention, rather than nuclear import  <cit> . in this present study, we have undertaken a detailed analysis of the role played by this n-terminal sequence of ctbp <dig> in regulating ctbp protein localisation.

RESULTS
structure and phylogenetics of ctbp loci
the ctbp <dig> protein sequence was subjected to an in silico search for potential nuclear localisation signals  <cit>  and a potential nls  was identified at amino acids  8– <dig>  because this sequence is located within the non-conserved n-terminus of ctbp <dig>  and because of the differential promoter usage and alternative splicing of the variant ctbp proteins, we first clarified the genomic structures of the 5' regions of the ctbp <dig> and ctbp <dig> loci . fig. 1b shows the n-terminus of human ctbp <dig> and its homology to other known ctbp proteins. the putative nls in human ctbp <dig> is conserved completely in mouse and zebrafish ctbp <dig>  and contains a single amino acid substitution in quail ctbp <dig>  ctbp <dig>  as well as the single ctbp in drosophila and xenopus, do not contain this sequence, though drosophila ctbp does contain a short lysine-arginine rich sequence  that is not present in ctbp <dig> proteins. it is also interesting to note that a.a. 1– <dig> in ctbp <dig>  including the putative nls, is encoded by a short exon  <dig> that is located more than  <dig> kb upstream of the rest of the gene.

amino acids 4– <dig> of ctbp <dig> promote its localisation to the nucleus
in order to establish whether the unique n-terminal region of ctbp <dig> is important in determining ctbp <dig> subcellular distribution, we expressed various ctbp2-egfp fusion proteins in hek  <dig> cells .  <dig> hours after transfection, cells were fixed and counterstained with dapi, and analysed by fluorescence microscopy. control, egfp alone localised to the nucleus and cytoplasm . both full-length ctbp2-egfp  and a truncated version containing a.a. 8– <dig> and the n-terminal pxdls-binding domain, ctbp2-egfp , were detectable exclusively in the nucleus. deletion of eleven amino acids encompassing a.a. 8– <dig> in full length ctbp <dig> Δ4–14-egfp) resulted in a partial redistribution of the protein to the cytoplasm, although it was still predominantly nuclear . the Δ4– <dig> mutation was also made in the context of ctbp2-egfp , and resulted in a more pronounced redistribution to the cytoplasm compared to its effect on the full length protein, though again egfp fluorescence was still detectable in the nucleus. substitution of a.a. 4– <dig> with a bona fide nls from sv <dig> large tumour antigen at the n-terminus of the truncated ctbp <dig> mutant nls-egfp) also resulted in exclusive nuclear localisation . thus, residues 4– <dig> of ctbp <dig> are important for maintaining its nuclear localisation, although other regions within ctbp <dig> protein are clearly also involved.

to ensure that the above results were not affected by the presence of a large egfp tag, we cloned various ctbp constructs into a vector containing a smaller myc-his tag . expressed proteins were detected using a 6xhis-specific primary antibody. a nuclear localisation in hek  <dig> cells was confirmed for exogenous full-length ctbp2mh . the deletion mutant Δ4–14mh) showed a similar nuclear and cytoplasmic localisation to its corresponding egfp fusion protein . we also cloned full length ctbp <dig> into this expression vector, in order to compare results with that of ctbp <dig>  and with other studies. consistent with previous studies on other cell lines, exogenous ctbp1mh localises primarily to the nucleus, with some cytoplasmic staining .

cell type-specific differences have been observed in the degree of nuclear and cytoplasmic localisation of over-expressed ctbp <dig>  <cit> . we wanted to investigate the behaviour of ctbp <dig> following over-expression in different cell lines, and specifically whether it would still be localised to the nucleus in cells in which ctbp <dig> is cytoplasmic. as expected  <cit> , ctbp1mh is distributed in the both the nucleus and cytoplasm of hela cells, with staining being strongest in the nucleus . similar to a previous report  <cit> , we found that ctbp1mh localises predominantly to the cytoplasm in over 60% of cos- <dig> cells, with some cells showing a nuclear and cytoplasmic distribution . ctbp1mh is nuclear and cytoplasmic in mcf- <dig> cells, similar to hela cells . ctbp2mh localises exclusively to the nucleus of all three cell lines . in the absence of a.a. 4– <dig>  ctbp2Δ4–14mh remains primarily nuclear in all three cell lines, though with a clear increase in cytoplasmic staining similar to our findings in hek  <dig> cells, . these experiments, particularly those with cos- <dig> cells, confirm that the presence of a.a. 4– <dig> in ctbp <dig> confers upon it an almost exclusively nuclear distribution. this is in contrast to ctbp <dig>  which shows cell type-dependent variations in its localisation.

binding of pxdls-containing proteins is not required for the a.a. 4–14-independent nuclear localisation of ctbp2
our experiments show that even when a.a. 4– <dig> are absent, a large proportion of the ctbp <dig> still localises to the nucleus. as a previous study has shown that binding of a pxdls-containing protein to ctbp <dig> promotes its nuclear localisation  <cit> , we decided to investigate whether such an interaction may also drive the nuclear localisation of ctbp <dig>  we introduced a point mutation  into the pxdls-binding motif of the ctbp2mh constructs to generate ctbp2v72rmh and ctbp2Δ4–14v72rmh. this mutation renders ctbps defective in their interaction with pxdls-containing proteins  <cit> . full-length ctbp2mh with the v72r mutation localises to the nucleus in both cos- <dig> and mcf- <dig> cells . ctbp2Δ4–14v72rmh localises to both the nucleus and cytoplasm , with no further increase in cytoplasmic distribution compared to the ctbp2Δ4–14mh protein . we therefore conclude that the a.a. 4–14-independent nuclear localisation of ctbp <dig> in these cells also occurs independently of its pxdls binding ability.

ctbp <dig> influences ctbp <dig> subcellular localisation
we, and others, have shown that the unique n-terminal region of ctbp <dig> is a major factor driving its accumulation in the nucleus. as ctbp <dig> lacks this sequence, the mechanisms determining its subcellular distribution remain an important question for understanding the regulation of its function. to this end, we asked whether heterodimerisation with ctbp <dig> might be able to recruit ctbp <dig> to the nucleus. to examine this, we analysed the effects of co-expressing both mhctbp <dig> and various ctbp2-egfp constructs in cos- <dig> cells. ctbp1mh, when transfected individually  or with egfp-n <dig> control , is predominantly cytoplasmic. co-expression of ctbp1mh with ctbp2-egfp results in a striking relocalisation of ctbp1mh to the nucleus in a high proportion of the cells . quantification of this by counting stained cells showed over-expressed ctbp1mh to be primarily cytoplasmic in 75% of the cells, with a mixed nuclear/cytoplasmic localisation in 25%. when co-transfected with ctbp2-egfp, this changes to 45% nuclear/cytoplasmic and 55% primarily nuclear. this effect is dependent on ctbp <dig> being correctly localised to the nucleus, as demonstrated by the effects of co-expressing ctbp1mh and ctbp2Δ4–14-egfp . finally, we demonstrate that the recruitment of ctbp <dig> to the nucleus by ctbp <dig> requires a.a. 120– <dig> of ctbp <dig>  as co-expression of egfp-ctbp <dig> does not alter the localisation of ctbp1mh , and the two proteins fail to co-localise. as a.a. 120– <dig> contain the dimerisation domain, this finding is consistent with heterodimerisation with ctbp <dig> being a mechanism whereby ctbp <dig> can be recruited to the nucleus.

discussion
we show firstly that the deletion of eleven amino acids  encompassing the putative nls sequence kvkrqr at a.a. 8– <dig> of ctbp <dig> results in shift in the localisation of detectable ctbp <dig> from exclusively nuclear, to nuclear and partly cytoplasmic. this effect was observed in a number of cell lines of diverse origin. these initial findings confirm a recently published study which identified a role for a.a. 1– <dig> in the nuclear localisation and retention of ctbp <dig>  <cit> , as well as another study which was published whilst this manuscript was being submitted  <cit> . our data further localises the critical sequence elements to a.a. 4– <dig>  one of the cell lines, cos- <dig>  was chosen because a previous study had shown that transfected ctbp <dig> primarily localises to the cytoplasm in these cells, making them a useful experimental model  <cit> . amino acids 4– <dig> also direct nuclear accumulation of ctbp <dig> in cos- <dig> cells. therefore, whatever the mechanism that underlies the cytoplasmic localisation of ctbp <dig> expressed in cos- <dig> cells, it does not affect the ability of a.a. 4– <dig> to localise ctbp <dig> to the nucleus. as a primary function of ctbp proteins is as nuclear transcriptional co-repressors, this sequence in ctbp <dig> is likely to play a key role in maintaining nuclear ctbp activity in cells where ctbp <dig> is expressed.

before considering the role of a.a. 4– <dig> further, it is important to note that we, as well as zhao et al  <cit>  who examined the effects of an a.a. 1– <dig> deletion, observed that ctbp <dig> with these n-terminal sequences deleted still retained a predominantly nuclear localisation, with only a partial redistribution to the cytoplasm. interestingly, verger et al  <cit>  found than a ctbp2Δ1– <dig> mutant localised almost exclusively in the cytoplasm in cos- <dig> cells. this different result could be due to the slightly larger deletion that they used, the cell type, or experimental differences. however, our experiments clearly show that domains other than a.a. 4– <dig> can be important in defining the nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution of ctbp <dig>  these could potentially become important under conditions whereby the n-terminal sequences of ctbp <dig> might be masked, such as following binding of another protein or through post-translational modification. as the localisation of ctbp2Δ4–14mh in all four cell lines closely resembled that of transfected ctbp <dig> in hek  <dig>  hela and mcf- <dig> cells it is possible this a.a. 4–14-independent nuclear localisation occurs through the same mechanisms that regulate ctbp <dig>  in studies on cos- <dig> cells, criqui-philipe et al  <cit>  showed that ctbp <dig> could be recruited to the nucleus through an association with pxdls containing transcription factors. structural studies on rat ctbp1-s  have characterised the pxdls-binding interface, and identified mutations  that disrupt ctbp-binding to the c-terminal domain of e1a. we therefore examined the effects of generating the ctbp <dig> equivalent of the ctbp1-sv55r mutation. our finding that this v72r mutation of ctbp2Δ4–14mh does not affect its subcellular localisation excludes the pxdls-binding interface as the major determinant for the a.a. 4–14-independent localisation of ctbp <dig> to the nucleus in these experiments. the n-terminal  <dig> a.a of ctbp <dig> is able to engage in other protein-protein interactions through less well-defined interfaces, e.g.  <cit> , and a role for these interactions in ctbp <dig> subcellular distribution cannot yet be excluded.

our experiments showed that ctbp2Δ4–14mh has a markedly more cytoplasmic distribution than ctbp2Δ4–14mh. this identifies a.a. 120– <dig> as having a role in nuclear localisation. when compared to domains in this region of ctbp <dig> with a known role in subcellular localisation, ctbp <dig> lacks the pdz binding motif present at the extreme c-terminus of ctbp <dig>  <cit> , as well as the equivalent of the sumoylation site at k <dig>  <cit> . sequences that are conserved which are good candidates for a role in ctbp <dig> nuclear localisation are the pak <dig> phosphorylation site at ser  <dig>  given that the phosphorylation status of the corresponding site in ctbp <dig>  regulates its subcellular localisation  <cit> , and possibly the dimerisation domain. in the intact ctbp <dig> protein, the n-, c- and core domains do not function independently  <cit> . it is quite possible that whilst a.a. 120– <dig> are necessary for optimal nuclear localisation, a functional interaction between this region of the molecule and other sequences within a.a. 1– <dig> is required for a.a. 4–14-independent nuclear accumulation.

the experimental data obtained from our analysis of truncations and mutants of ctbp <dig> also provides additional insight into the mechanism of regulation of subcellular localisation by a.a. 4– <dig> containing the putative ctbp <dig> nls. zhao et al  <cit>  demonstrated that this region does not, in fact, function as a classical nls, but rather that it is necessary for lysines within it, primarily lysine  <dig>  to be acetylated for it to direct localisation in the nucleus. specifically they showed that lysines in this sequence are acetylated in vivo and that this is likely to be through the actions of the p <dig> acetyltransferase, a known ctbp binding protein. their experiments using a non-acetylatable k10r mutant of ctbp <dig> showed that this acetylation is required for retention of ctbp <dig> in the nucleus, and that this mutant actually enhances ctbp <dig> nuclear export. analogous to our experiments with the v72r mutant, they also showed that a different mutant in the pxdls binding domain  does not affect acetylation by p <dig>  and therefore p <dig> must bind to different sequences on ctbp <dig> than other pxdls transcription factors. in contrast, verger et al  <cit>  concluded that this n-terminal lysine-arginine rich region functions as a classical nuclear localisation signal, with a role in nuclear import, rather than retention.

the experiments that we have performed do not distinguish between these two alternative mechanisms. our finding that a.a 1– <dig> of ctbp <dig> is sufficient to drive efficient nuclear accumulation of egfp provides an important advance in our understanding of the regions that regulate the subcellular distribution of ctbp <dig>  however, the data are consistent with a role of a.a. 4– <dig> in either nuclear retention or import. both previous studies demonstrated that the n terminal  <dig> amino acids cannot, alone, target a heterologous protein to the nucleus. this could be either due to an nls or nuclear retention signal not being correctly presented to their target binding proteins in the context of these molecules, or the requirement for docking of acetyltransferases to a separate part of the molecule in order to achieve activation of the nuclear retention signal by acetylation. in ctbp2-egfp either the sequences may simply be sufficiently spaced from the egfp for a.a. 4– <dig> to be correctly presented as an nls, or this region may include the p <dig> binding site, allowing activation of the nuclear retention signal by acetylation. ctbp2-egfp is small enough to enter the nucleus by passive diffusion, and therefore the presence of a nuclear retention signal would be sufficient for nuclear accumulation. expression of a.a. 1– <dig> in the context of a fusion with 2xegfp would generate a larger protein that could only accumulate in the nucleus if it were actively imported through nuclear pores. however further experimentation would be required to determine conclusively whether this was due to a.a. 4– <dig> functioning as an nls, or interaction of a.a. 1– <dig> with other actively imported proteins such as pxdls containing transcription factors  <cit> , hdm <dig>  <cit> , or possibly p <dig> acetyltransferase  <cit> .

finally, we have identified heterodimerisation with ctbp <dig> as a novel mechanism that can promote the nuclear localisation of ctbp <dig>  this interplay between the two proteins has also, very recently, been demonstrated by other investigators  <cit> . it will be interesting to determine the extent to which this heterodimerisation contributes to ctbp <dig> subcellular distribution in different cell types, compared with the other mechanisms that have been described previously. it is important to note that ctbp <dig> expression is clearly not an absolute requirement for nuclear ctbp <dig> activity in many cell types  <cit> . the contrasting subcellular localisations of over-expressed ctbp <dig> and ctbp <dig> in cos- <dig> cells add weight to the growing argument that the two proteins are regulated differently. indeed, studies on the role of ctbp <dig> and ctbp <dig> during murine development revealed a more severe and lethal phenotype in ctbp2-/- mice compared to ctbp1-/- mice  <cit> . this has been attributed to temporal and spatial differences in the expression of ctbp <dig> and ctbp <dig> during development  <cit> . alternatively, it could be explained by the different modes of regulation of protein localisation and function between these two proteins, implying that perturbation of the constitutive nuclear function of ctbps is responsible for the embryonic lethality of ctbp2-/- animals. ctbp <dig> with an n-terminal motif that promotes its nuclear localisation is present in mice, man and fish. it is not yet known whether the smaller krsr sequence in drosophila ctbp is functional, and xenopus ctbp does not contain any such motif in its n-terminus. therefore, ctbp in xenopus, and possibly drosophila, will likely be dependent upon other protein-protein interactions for its recruitment to the nucleus. it is tempting to speculate, therefore, that this is an indicator of an increased importance of the nuclear activities of ctbp proteins in the regulation of the complex patterns of gene expression in higher organisms.

CONCLUSIONS
ctbp <dig> and ctbp <dig> show a high degree of similarity at the sequence and functional level. differential control of their subcellular localisation is likely to provide mechanisms to regulate critical nuclear and cytoplasmic functions of ctbps in the cells of higher organisms. here we have identified distinct regions in ctbp <dig> that play a key role in regulating the subcellular distribution of both ctbp <dig> and ctbp <dig> proteins.
