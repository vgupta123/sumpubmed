BACKGROUND
zinc-finger proteins of the gli family, gli <dig>  gli <dig>  and gli <dig> act as transcriptional mediators integrating various upstream patterning signals in a context dependent combinatorial and cooperative fashion to direct a multitude of developmental programs. gli <dig> and gli <dig> can serve both as transcriptional activators or repressors, whereas gli <dig>  whose expression is transcriptionally regulated by gli <dig> and gli <dig>  appears to play a secondary role, e.g. in potentiating response to the secreted protein sonic hedgehog   <cit> .

mutations in the human gli <dig> gene cause a variety of dominant developmental syndromes subsumed as "gli <dig> morphopathies"  <cit> , including greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome   <cit> , pallister hall syndrome   <cit> , postaxial polydactyly type a   <cit> , and preaxial polydactyly type iv   <cit> . mutations affecting murine gli <dig>  such as extra toes , anterior digit deformity , and polydactyly nagoya , serve as models for gli <dig> morphopathies. mouse embryos with homozygous gli <dig> deficiency show pleiotropic and lethal congenital malformations with distinct preaxial limb polydactylies  <cit> . all gli <dig> morphopathies show malformations of the autopod, i.e. polydactyly or syndactyly. in addition, craniofacial abnormalities are associated with greig cephalopolysyndactyly , and in the most severe form, pallister-hall syndrome , other developmental malformations occur, such as hypothalamic hamartoma, visceral anomalies, anus atresy, as well as epiglottis and larynx defects  <cit> .

a multitude of studies in mice and other model organisms have suggested that a gli code, the interplay of the gli proteins expressed in a quantitatively and temporally fine tuned pattern in adjacent domains, provides a basic morphogenetic tool that is used over and over during embryonic development  <cit> . gli-associated patterning has been studied preferentially in the vertebrate central nervous system  and in limbs. at different rostrocaudal levels of the cns, dorsoventral neural pattern elaboration can be achieved through the spatiotemporal integration of signals from antagonizing shh and bmp ligands  <cit>  in an interplay with wnt  <cit> , fibroblast growth factor  <cit> , and retinoic acid signaling  <cit> . in the vertebrate limb bud, mesenchymal cells aggregate in a proximal to distal sequence to give rise to cartilage condensations that prefigure all limb skeletal components  <cit> . sonic hedgehog  signals direct via gli transcription factors digit number and identity  <cit> . however, development of proximal skeletal elements  is distinctly regulated early during limb-bud formation. here, gli <dig> function independent of shh signaling appears to be involved  <cit> .

the wide spectrum of tasks demands a tight temporal and spatial regulation of gli <dig> gene expression and of the proteolytic truncation of activating full length gli <dig> protein to a short repressor form, respectively. whereas the crucial role of hedgehog signal transduction employing the gli code and the function of downstream target genes have been elucidated by a multitude of studies in humans and model animals  <cit> , cis-acting sequences and regulatory factors employed in spatiotemporal control of gli3/gli <dig> expression remained largely unknown.

human-fish conserved non-coding sequence elements  are candidate cis-acting enhancers of gene transcription  <cit> . previously, we had searched for non-coding sequence conservation between man and pufferfish within the gli <dig> gene itself and in flanking intervals of >  <dig> mb around this gene. in contrast to the situation described for most other genes, ancient conserved non-coding sequence elements are located exclusively in the introns of gli <dig>  contiguous human-fugu conservation at this location of human chromosome  <dig> essentially ends at the limits of gli <dig>  suggesting, that anciently conserved regulatory elements should be located within intronic intervals of this gene.

indeed,  <dig> out of  <dig> gli3-intronic cnes which show at least 50% identity over a  <dig> bp window down to fugu acted in transiently transfected cultured cells in a cell type dependent fashion as activators or repressors of reporter gene expression  <cit> . in endogenous gli <dig> expressing cells the majority of these elements functioned as activators whilst in a gli <dig> negative cellular context they actively repressed the transcription. this differential activity was taken as strong evidence in favor of assigning gli3-specific regulatory potential to these cnes. two of the cnes had a repressing potential, even in a gli <dig> positive cellular context. the dual nature of a subset of intra-gli <dig> enhancers could be based on the interaction with different subsets of trans-acting factors  in a cellular context dependent manner, whilst elements with repressing potential, even in a gli <dig> positive context, suggest the existence of context independent regulation. in vitro deletion analysis showed that enhancer activity of the cnes is determined by a combinatorial effect of ancient highly conserved modules and more recent flanking sequences  <cit> . by expressing reporter genes under the control of these human gli3-cnes in zebrafish embryos, we demonstrated that the activator or repressor function observed in human cell culture was retained in vivo in a teleost fish. only cnes which could activate reporter gene activity in gli <dig> positive context were able to activate a reporter gene in zebrafish embryos. to a large extent, reporter expression induced by these elements coincided with sites of endogenous zebrafish gli <dig> expression; however, there was considerable redundancy in expression control by the different cnes  <cit> . in transgenic mice assay, we could show that cne <dig>  an ultraconserved sequence element within intron  <dig> of gli <dig>  enhanced reporter gene expression at sites of endogenous gli <dig> expression  <cit> . for cne <dig>  a similar mouse expression pattern was reported in a genome-wide enhancer test of non-exonic ultraconserved elements in transgenic mouse embryos . in the genome-wide enhancer test two further enhancers were identified within gli <dig>  element # <dig> encasing cne <dig>  previously identified by abbasi et al.  <cit> , and the novel element # <dig> http://enhancer.lbl.gov. it is of notice that in that screen a candidate enhancer element flanking gli <dig> in an upstream position was unable to activate reporter gene expression  reporter elements with putative enhancers encasing cne <dig>  cne <dig>  and cne <dig> activated reporter gene expression in the dorsal spinal cord at sites of endogenous gli <dig> expression when tested by chicken in ovo electroporation  <cit> .

in this study, we employed transgenic assays to show that gli <dig> intronic cnes, which are able to activate transcription in cell cultures and zebrafish, can induce reporter gene activation at sites of endogenous gli <dig> expression also in chicken and mice. reporter gene expression was identified in craniofacial structures, limbs, brain, spinal cord, eye, and gut. in particular, these enhancers were able to target transgene expression to many known regions of endogenous gli <dig> transcription in limb buds as well as along the anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral axis of the developing mouse neural tube.

RESULTS
tetrapod-teleost conserved gli3-intronic enhancers identified by comparative sequence analysis
multi-species alignment of human gli <dig> genomic sequence with orthologous intervals from other vertebrate species localized  <dig> intronic conserved non-coding elements, showing at least 50% identity over a  <dig> bp window down to fugu. these elements are distributed across almost the entire gli <dig> interval , with  <dig> elements in each of introns  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> and one in each of introns  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  <cit> . the gli <dig> specific gene regulatory functions of  <dig> of these putative human enhancers had previously been determined using human cell lines . the elements which could activate reporter gene expression in cell cultures functioned likewise in zebrafish embryos  <cit> . additionally, the spatiotemporal aspects of one ultraconserved element, cne <dig>  were analyzed in mouse embryos  <cit> . however, the spatiotemporal functionality of other gli <dig> associated enhancers in a mammalian model remained to be defined.

to determine the tissue specific role of cnes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  which had acted as enhancers in cell cultures and zebrafish embryos, we generated transgenic mice driving lacz reporter gene expression under the control of each cne . the boundaries of the selected subset of enhancer regions were defined bearing in mind that full scale enhancer activity is determined by a combination of core sequences conserved between human and teleosts  and flanking tetrapod-specific sequences  <cit> .

cne <dig> mediated lacz expression was largely confined to foregut derivatives, eye and mammary placodes, and will be dealt with in detail elsewhere. here, we focus on the potential of cnes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> to replicate endogenous gli <dig> expression pattern during development of the limbs and the central nervous system .

enhancer elements from gli <dig> introns directing expression in the mouse limb bud
the gli <dig> expression patterns within the nascent limb bud are highly dynamic . initially, gli <dig> is expressed broadly in the mesenchyme of the emerging limb bud. at later stages, the genetic antagonism between gli <dig> and shh results in exclusion of the gli <dig> expression domain from the posterior limb mesenchyme  <cit> .

this expression pattern is in agreement with limb specific anomalies in gli <dig> mutants, in particular the anteroposterior patterning of distal limb elements, i.e. the autopod  <cit> . gli <dig> likewise plays a critical role in regulating the patterning of proximal and intermediate skeletal elements of limbs  at very early stages of development  <cit> . importantly, the gli <dig> functions in stylopod/zeugopod skeletal patterning are independent of its role in the anteroposterior patterning of the handplate  <cit> . however, as gli <dig> is broadly present throughout the developing limb , its expression within proximal mesenchymal condensations  can easily be overlooked  <cit> . nevertheless, recently, through western analysis and in situ hybridization, gli <dig> was detected in the cartilage of developing limb elements  <cit>  and plays a critical role in regulating proliferation during endochondral bone formation  <cit> .

in transgenic mouse embryos, the spatiotemporal regulatory activity of two distinct enhancers, cne <dig> and cne <dig>  reflects several of the known aspects of endogenous gli <dig> expression within cartilaginous and non cartilaginous mesenchyme of embryonic limbs . cne6-directed lacz expression coincides with the emergence of the limb bud, continues towards anterior, and concentrates at e <dig>  at the prospective mesenchyme condensations in the digits . this spatiotemporal activity overlaps with gli <dig> function during formation of proximal skeletal elements, stylopod/zeugopod  <cit> .

in contrast, cne <dig> directs reporter expression specifically within proximal regions of the limb bud from stage e <dig> on, once the mesenchyme starts to condense and form precartilage . this spatiotemporal activity overlaps with gli <dig> function in patterning of proximal skeletal elements, stylopod/zeugopod  <cit> . thus cne <dig> and cne <dig> elements showed non-redundant regulatory activities. since the sites of stable transgene insertion in the mouse lines have not been determined, this conclusion awaits confirmation by a larger number of independent transgenic mouse embryos. multiple sequence alignment coupled with pattern recognition computer programs identified conserved binding sites for number of transcription factors in cne <dig> and cne <dig> intervals , many of which are among the core set of limb regulators and are known to be co-expressed with gli <dig> during early limb patterning and growth  <cit> . their role in the control of gli <dig> expression by interaction with cne <dig> and cne <dig> will be tested experimentally.

it is of note that gli <dig> transcriptional activity appears to be important for the separation of individual fingers  <cit> , and also endogenous gli <dig> is known to be expressed strongly in the interdigital mesenchyme at e <dig>  . however, the mesenchyme in between the prospective digit rays is an area where we did not observe this much expression with both cne <dig> and cne <dig> enhancer elements. previously, we had detected reporter gene activity in the interdigital mesenchyme at e <dig>  in transgenic mice employing the cne <dig> enhancer element  <cit> . earlier interdigital gli <dig> expression appears to be governed by other enhancer regions. the vista enhancer browser http://enhancer.lbl.gov lists as element_ <dig> a gli <dig> intragenic enhancer activating reporter gene activity at e <dig>  distally in mouse embryo limbs. study of the temporal and spatial activity of this enhancer element, which did not meet the inclusion criteria of our study, must be awaited to determine if it acts in a complementary fashion or if it overlaps the activity of cne <dig> or cne <dig> 

enhancer elements from gli <dig> introns directing expression in the chicken limb bud
expressing a reporter controlled by human gli3-cnes in transgenic zebrafish embryos could not identify one of them reliably as fin-specific enhancer  <cit> . to determine, if limb bud specificity similar to the results obtained in mice was attributed to individual gli3-cnes in birds, we analysed if cnes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> act as enhancers of gli3-specific expression in the chicken limb buds. these cnes were cloned into a gfp reporter construct under the control of a β-globin promoter  <cit>  and co-electroporated together with an rfp reporter, to control for electroporation efficiency, into the chicken wing bud at stage hh 19/ <dig>  the developing chicken limbs were assessed for rfp and gfp expression  <dig> hours following electroporation when the embryos had reached approximately stage hh  <dig>  at this stage, gli <dig> has been reported to be expressed throughout the proximal region and at the distal anterior edge of the chicken wing bud   <cit> . figure 4b shows the results of the electroporation experiments. the upper row shows control bright field photographs of the electroporated limb buds analyzed in the next two rows. the middle row shows rfp expression in the limb bud indicating the extent of electroporation. the bottom row shows gfp expression in the same limb bud. cnes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> gave no gfp expression despite rfp being expressed throughout the limb. cne <dig> and cne <dig> had weak gfp expression in 3/ <dig> and 2/ <dig> cases, respectively, indicating slight enhancer activity. the distribution of gli <dig> mrna in the limb at stage hh <dig> is shown below via in situ hybridisation . gli <dig> highly expressed distally but also proximally at the posterior margin and therefore reporter activity appears to be within the region of the limb expressing gli <dig>  at earlier stages, gli <dig> is more highly expressed throughout the anterior of the limb bud, and therefore we might expect that electroporation of the putative enhancer constructs at an earlier stage would provide a better test for enhancer activity. in a second set of experiments we therefore electroporated cne <dig> into the presumptive limb mesenchyme  <cit>  at stage hh <dig> of  <dig> embryos, and then looked for enhancer activity  <dig> hours post electroporation at approximately stage hh <dig>  rfp expression was found throughout the anterior region of the limb, however, no gfp expression was seen in any of the cases examined , although the construct had been successfully electroporated into the region of the limb bud, which would be expressing gli <dig> 

consistent with data from mice, cne <dig> and cne <dig> were able to drive reporter expression in developing chicken limbs at stage hh <dig> , while cnes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were not. we have previously demonstrated that conserved non-coding elements downstream of the homeobox gene shox have enhancer activity using the same assay  <cit> . in that case three out of the eight cnes tested showed enhancer activity indicating that some but not all conserved non-coding elements act as enhancers. the remaining cnes may act to regulate the gene in another way, for example, as repressors. another difference between the present study and previous experiments with shox is that gli <dig> has a more restricted expression pattern and lower level of expression than shox at later stages. this may reduce the chance of introducing a putative enhancer construct into a gli <dig> expressing region of the limb bud and therefore make it more difficult to detect enhancer activity. however, introduction of cne <dig> into the limb at an earlier stage when gli <dig> expression is more widespread did not show any enhancer activity. this observation is in line with the data obtained in mouse embryos where cne <dig> started to enhance reporter gene activity at e <dig>  and was inactive at earlier stages.

gli <dig> enhancer activity reflects evolutionary advances of limb specification
our finding that enhancer elements within gli <dig> act differentially during mouse limb patterning corroborates the current view of limb evolution. despite the morphological and functional diversity of fish fin and mammalian limbs, development of these structures is regulated by a similar and related set of genes  <cit> . evolution of regulatory components was proposed to be key for the origin and subsequent morphological diversification of the vertebrate fin/limb skeleton  <cit> . the spatiotemporal regulatory role of cnes  <dig> and  <dig> in zebrafish was more redundant with that of other gli <dig> enhancers and not preferentially used for fin/limb patterning as now seen in mice  <cit> . during early embryonic development of the tetrapod limb, gli <dig> plays a double role: shh dependent anteroposterior patterning of the autopod and shh independent specification of skeletal elements along the proximodistal axis from the stylopod up to the distal margin of the zeugopod  <cit> . in accordance with these two distinct roles, this study has defined distinct enhancer regions residing in introns of gli <dig> that independently regulate expression in the evolutionary ancient stylopod and zeugopod or in modern skeletal structures of the limb autopod, respectively. this suggests that redeployment of ancient cis-regulatory elements to direct gli <dig> expression in distinct limb domains might have been instrumental in diversifying the vertebrate limb skeleton during the course of evolution.

enhancer elements from gli <dig> introns directing expression in the mouse cns
the spatiotemporal activities of cne <dig>  cne <dig>  and cne <dig> complemented each other in the control of reporter expression reflecting part of the gli3-specific pattern in the brain, spinal cord and craniofacial structures . the mouse embryo expression patterns governed at e <dig>  by cne <dig> and cne <dig>  respectively, are independently reported in the vista enhancer browser for sequence elements  <dig> and  <dig> which include the sequences employed here http://enhancer.lbl.gov, adding credibility to the notion that the cnes studied are bona fide gli <dig> enhancers.

at day e <dig> , cne1-controlled lacz was strongly expressed in the dorsal brain and spinal cord, and less prominently in hypaxial buds of the thoracic somites, proximal muscle masses in the forelimb bud, dorsal root ganglion, and in the facial mesenchyme . at e <dig> , stronger reporter activity was seen in the cerebellum and nerves innervating the dorsolateral trunk region and forelimbs, and extended more rostrally in the head mesenchyme . in the midbrain, transgene expression was present in the roofplate, dorso-lateral portion of the alar plate, and confined to a marginal layer of the basal plate . in the spinal cord, x-gal signal was present in the roofplate, in a central region presumably covering the progenitor domains of dorsal interneurons dl5-dl <dig> and the ventro-lateral progenitor domains vp0-vp <dig>  as well as in the ventral most mantle zone of the spinal cord occupying the post-mitotic v <dig> interneurons . additionally, lacz activity was detected in the medial and lateral nasal processes, precartilage primordium of nasal capsule, meckel's cartilage, lateral palatine process, and in the dental lamina . the role of cne <dig>  a highly conserved non-coding element, has been outlined previously  <cit> . whereas the reporter expression driven by cne <dig> was present throughout the walls of telencephalic vesicle, cne <dig> activity was confined medially. thus, there is a partial overlap in the activities of these two enhancers within the anterior domain of the forebrain. at e <dig> , reporter activity induced by cne <dig> was detected in the dorso-lateral aspects of the anterior and posterior midbrain regions and in ventral portions of the hindbrain and spinal cord up-to the level of forelimb region . at e <dig> , cne <dig> driven transgene expression was also demonstrated in the medial ganglionic eminence . in transverse sections, cne <dig> driven lacz expression was observed in the ventral midline of caudal midbrain  and confined to the dorso-lateral marginal layer . reporter activity induced by cne <dig> in the cns overlapped with cne <dig> only in the dorso-lateral marginal tissue of the midbrain .

notably, in the developing spinal cord cne <dig> induced reporter expression appeared up to e <dig>  in the motor neuron progenitor domain . thus, regulatory factors operating at different time intervals via cne <dig> or cne <dig> could activate gli <dig> expression in motor neuron or interneuron territories, respectively.

according to current models, in the ventral spinal cord positional information encoded by a ventral to dorsal shh gradient is transmitted by a gli code, the interplay of activator or repressor functions of gli proteins . in mouse embryos, gli <dig> functioning as transcriptional activator is expressed in the ventral neural tube whereas the expression pattern of gli <dig> remains uniform along the dorsal-ventral axis of neural tube  <cit> . gli <dig> is expressed extensively in the intermediate and dorsal spinal cord regions. consistent with its expression pattern, genetic studies with mice suggest that gli <dig> repressor activity  is essential for the normal patterning of at least six neuronal classes: v <dig>  v <dig>  v <dig>  di <dig>  di <dig>  and di <dig> neurons in the intermediate region of the spinal cord  <cit> . in addition to its repressor role in the intermediate spinal cord, gli <dig> can transduce hedgehog signaling as an activator. for instance, at the highest levels of hh  all expression of the hh target gene gli <dig> is dependent on both gli <dig> and gli <dig>  unlike gli <dig>  however, gli <dig> requires endogenous gli <dig> for induction of floor plate and v <dig> interneurons  <cit> . beyond the well established dorso-ventral patterning function through a gli3-derepression mechanism, shh and gli <dig> activities are required to promote the timely appearance of motor neuron progenitors  in the developing spinal cord  <cit> . the weak activator functions of endogenous gli <dig> observed by bai and coworkers  <cit>  near the source of shh are compatible with a subtle expression of gli <dig> protein in the three most ventral domains, fp, v <dig> and mn. the domains of gli <dig> expression and gli <dig> function in the developing spinal cord reported in these studies are mirrored perfectly by the sites of cne <dig> and cne <dig> action.

electroporation of reporter constructs employing conserved gli3-intronic sequences, which include cne <dig> or cne <dig>  induced the strongest expression signals preferentially in the dorsal spinal cord  <cit> . however, time, amount, and location of expression governed by these enhancer elements, are analyzed in greater detail in transgenic mouse embryos.

evolutionary conserved transcription factor binding sites  are predicted in cne <dig>  cne <dig>  and cne <dig> intervals for multiple established developmental regulators , many of which are known to be co-expressed with gli <dig> during embryonic development of brain and spinal cord  <cit> . their interaction with these enhancers remains to be determined experimentally.

including cne <dig>  we have identified three independent gli3-intronic enhancer regions that control reporter expression in developing neural tissues of the mouse embryo in a time- and position-specific complementary fashion. with multiple independent enhancers controlling early cns patterning, gli <dig> follows suit other key developmental genes with a high level of complexity in their genetic regulatory mechanisms governing neural tube patterning  <cit> .

multiple independently acting regulatory sequences herald the occurrence of higher levels of modularity in the body plans of modern vertebrates
it has widely been accepted that differences in morphological and anatomical traits among closely related species are correlated to changes in cis-acting sequences  <cit> . our study on the spatiotemporal activity of independent, anciently conserved cis-regulatory modules, controlling expression of the evolutionary conserved developmental regulator gene gli <dig> during limb  and cns patterning , suggests that these enhancers dictate expression in discrete developmental compartments. above that, cellular subpopulations within a given compartment, such as the motor neuron or interneuron territories in the spinal cord behave as semiautonomous units with respect to expression control of gli <dig> . this subtle specification of enhancer functions corroborates the view that cis-acting regulatory networks of early developmental regulators are often modular, with multiple independent enhancers mediating the expression of associated gene in multiple embryonic compartments independently  <cit> . functional changes in one specific cis-regulator through mutations might alter the spatiotemporal distribution of the associated gene product in one developmental domain, whereas the rest of the expression pattern and the protein activity will largely remain un-interrupted. thus changes in cis-acting sequences will have minimal cost on overall fitness and can serve as raw material for the evolution of morphological and anatomical diversification within and between species.

CONCLUSIONS
this work adds to the growing body of data indicating that cell fate and tissue patterning during embryonic development are governed through the temporal integration of different combinations of signaling ligands at autonomous enhancers. a growing body of empirical evidence suggests that it is not uncommon for developmental regulatory genes to harbor their entire or subset of cis-acting gene regulatory elements within their intronic intervals http://condor.fugu.biology.qmul.ac.uk and http://enhancer.lbl.gov. the location of ancient gli3-specific enhancers exclusively within the gene hints at a their critical relevance, since genomic rearrangements during evolution leaving the gene intact would not have separated cis-acting regulatory elements from the coding sequence.

our description of a catalog for gli <dig> specific cis-regulatory sequences offers a new perspective for studying the genetic mechanisms by which the downstream effectors of hedgehog signaling cascade might themselves be regulated at correct place and precise time to direct pattern formation along the body axis during embryogenesis. identifying the code of trans-acting molecules which jointly activate specific gli <dig> enhancers, such as cne <dig> in stylopod and zeugopod or cne <dig> in the autopod may help to understand the mechanisms by which a proper balance between shh and gli <dig> transcripts is established in complementary domains of the limb bud.

in humans, functional deficiency of gli <dig> is associated with polydactyly or craniofacial abnormalities  <cit> . mutations in enhancers directing gli <dig> expression in the affected developmental fields, such as cne <dig> or cne <dig>  can potentially affect the timely availability of gli <dig> transcript during embryogenesis. they are novel targets for mutation analysis in patients with gli <dig> morphopathies which cannot be attributed to a mutation in the coding sequence of this gene.
