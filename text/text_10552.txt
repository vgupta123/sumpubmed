BACKGROUND
when the human genome was sequenced, it was found to contain approximately  <dig>  <dig> genes  <cit> . considering the complex biological system encoded by these genes, this seems to be a small number. however, alternative transcripts that arise from different transcription start sites or alternative splicing, may yield a much larger array of functionally related proteins than suggested from the number of actual genes. large scale genomic studies have revealed that 65% of all genes have alternative transcripts  <cit> . elucidation of the role and regulation of transcript variants may shed light on how a rather modest number of genes can give rise to the complexity of human biology  <cit> .

related proteins encoded by the same gene through alternative transcription may have opposing functions in the cell. for instance, transcription factors may exist as isoforms lacking particular dna- or protein interacting domains. when such isoforms are expressed, they may inhibit the function of the full length protein  <cit> . an in silico analysis of the mouse transcriptome revealed that alternative splicing preferentially adds or deletes domains in transcription factors that are important for dna binding  <cit> .

the function of a protein encoded by a particular gene may thus be regulated at the level of differential expression of various transcript variants dependent on the tissue or cell type, or the differentiation status and previous history of the cell  <cit> . one prominent example of this type of gene regulation in t cells, is the cd <dig> protein, a membrane receptor tyrosine phosphatase that exists as several isoforms generated by alternative splicing of exons  <cit> . the quality of the t cell response in naïve versus experienced t cells is determined in part by the composition of expressed cd <dig> isoforms on the cell surface  <cit> .

previously, we reported the cloning of the immunoregulatory gene sh2d2a that encodes the t cell specific adapter protein   <cit> . adapter proteins lack catalytic activity, but may be crucial in regulation of cellular signalling by mediating protein-protein interactions through conserved protein binding domains  <cit> . the function of tsad is as yet unclear, but the murine homologue lad/ribp has been identified as a binding partner for lck, itk/rlk, mekk <dig> and grb <dig>  <cit>  and human tsad has been found to associate with lck  <cit>  as well as the molecular chaperone vcp  <cit>  and vascular endothelial growth receptor  <dig>   <cit> . recently it has been shown that tsad vegfr- <dig> interaction promotes actin polymerization and migration  <cit> . tsad may be involved in the regulation of membrane proximal t cell signalling by modulating the lck activity  <cit> , and it has been proposed that tsad may be directly involved in regulation of gene transcription as a transcription adapter protein  <cit> . mice lacking expression of tsad are apparently normal  <cit> , but as they grow older they spontaneously develop a systemic autoimmune disease  <cit> .

five naturally occurring transcript variants of human tsad exist. the sh2d2a- <dig>  variant encodes full length tsad  <cit> , whereas the sh2d2a- <dig>  and - <dig>  variants encodes tsad proteins shortened by  <dig> aa and  <dig> aa in the n-terminus, respectively. the sh2d2a- <dig>  variant encodes a  <dig> aa insertion in the sh <dig> domain of tsad, whereas the sh2d2a- <dig> variant  lacks the entire exon  <dig>  <cit> , which encodes most of the proline rich region including the four c-terminal tyrosines  of tsad. the sh2d2a-1- <dig> variants have been isolated from t cells, whereas the sh2d2a- <dig> variant was first identified in a pineal gland cdna library  <cit> .

in this study, we analysed tsad molecules encoded by the sh2d2a transcript variants to identify potentially important functional domains. we identified tsad aa239– <dig> encoded by exon  <dig>  to be crucial for tyrosine phosphorylation of tsad by lck, for interaction with the lck-sh <dig> and lck-sh <dig> domain, and for modulation of lck activity. in addition, tsad aa239– <dig> controls tsad translocation to the nucleus. in conclusion, this study demonstrates that exon  <dig> encodes structures of importance for tsad function, and that truncated tsad is co-expressed with the full length tsad in cd4+ t cells. whether alternative transcripts of tsad contribute to regulation of tsad function, by being differentially regulated under given circumstances or in given tissues remains to be elucidated.

RESULTS
expression of tsad variants in primary cd4+ t cells
five transcript variants of tsad that encode tsad polypeptides with variable lengths have been reported . we previously observed that tsad mrnas sh2d2a-1- <dig> were expressed in pha stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells  <cit> . in this study, we used reverse transcriptase quantitative pcr assay  to assess the relative amounts of tsad transcript variants expressed in primary cd4+ t cells . the sh2d2a- <dig> and - <dig> variants constituted 10–15% each, whereas the sh2d2a- <dig> variant which was originally cloned from a pineal gland library, constituted around 5–10% of the total amount of tsad-transcripts in anti-cd <dig> stimulated cd4+ t cells from healthy blood donors. the sh2d2a- <dig> variant, although present, often fell below the detection limit of the assay. it is possible that the function of tsad may be regulated by changing the relative amount of the different tsad transcript variants. we therefore analysed the expression of tsad transcript variants at different time points after anti-cd <dig> stimulation of cd4+ t cells. as seen from figure 2b, the relative distribution of the tsad transcript variants was relatively constant during the observation period. immunoblot of primary cd4+ t cells stimulated through ligation of cd3ε, revealed induction of a strong band of  <dig> kda and a weaker band of  <dig> kda reactive with tsad antibody after  <dig> and  <dig> hours of stimulation. the  <dig> kda band is induced in parallel with the  <dig> kda tsad reactive band  and is inhibited similar to tsad in cd4+ t cells transfected with sirna prior to cd <dig> stimulation . taken together, these results suggest that different isoforms of tsad are expressed in cd4+ t cells, and that tsad in cd <dig> stimulated cd4+ t cells is not controlled through the differential expression of tsad transcript variants.

the tsad n-terminus modifies phosphorylation of tsad in jurkat t cells
we then tested whether tsad variants encoded by the sh2d2a gene displayed distinct functional properties. tsad is phosphorylated upon tyrosines after cd <dig> stimulation  <cit>  and lck has been identified as a kinase that is able to interact with and phosphorylate tsad  <cit> . we therefore assessed tyrosine phosphorylation of ha-tagged tsad variants transiently expressed in jurkat t cells before and after anti-cd <dig> stimulation. in comparison with full length tsad , tsad molecules with shortened n-terminus , displayed 2– <dig> fold higher levels of phosphorylation both in resting and cd <dig> stimulated jurkat t cells . both variants were tyrosine phosphorylated when co-expressed with lck in 293t cells . these results suggest that the n-terminal  <dig> amino acids of tsad harbours information that either modify tsad interaction with lck or other kinases within jurkat t cells, or that the n-terminus contains some localisation signal, that when absent makes tsad more accessible for particular tyrosine kinase activity within the jurkat t cell.

tsad with aberrant sh <dig> domain is not phosphorylated by lck
several lines of evidence indicate that tsad in addition to lck may be tyrosine phosphorylated by other kinases, including src  <cit> , vegfr- <dig>  <cit> , pdgfr  <cit>  and zap- <dig>  <cit> . tsad with an aberrant sh <dig> domain  displayed a similar phosphorylation level as full length tsad  when expressed in jurkat t cells . we previously showed that truncated tsad lacking the n-terminal aa 1– <dig> including tsad sh <dig> domain, is phosphorylated by lck when co-expressed in 293t cells  <cit> . however, surprisingly as shown in figure 3b, when expressed in 293t cells, lck did not phosphorylate the sh2d2a- <dig> variant. this result is consistent with similar results obtained with tsad mutated for the conserved arginine in position  <dig> in the sh <dig> domain . taken together, these results indicate that although the c-terminus of tsad is sufficient for phosphorylation of tsad by lck, in non-t-cells there is a requirement for an intact sh <dig> domain for lck mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of the full length tsad.

tsad aa239– <dig> controls tyrosine phosphorylation of tsad
tsad lacking aa239– <dig>  was not tyrosine phosphorylated in jurkat t cells, nor in 293t cells when co-expressed with lck . this indicates that aa239– <dig> harbors one or more tyrosine phosphorylation sites, or motifs crucial for interaction of tsad with lck or other tyrosine kinases. indeed a scansite search  <cit>  identified several potential lck-sh <dig> and lck-sh <dig> interaction motifs within the tsad aa239– <dig>  <cit> . to specifically test whether one or more of the four tyrosines in the aa239– <dig> sequence could be phosphorylated by lck, we thus generated a tsad mutant with all four tyrosines mutated to phenylalanine . we also generated a tsad mutant where a putative lck-sh <dig> interaction site at aa239– <dig> was deleted . when transiently co-expressed with lck in 293t cells tsad-d239– <dig> was still phosphorylated on tyrosine, whereas tsad-4yf was only very weakly phosphorylated .

tsad aa239– <dig> and the tsad-sh <dig> domain mediate interaction with lck
we previously demonstrated that tsad interacts with lck in jurkat t cells stably expressing ha-tagged tsad  <cit> . here we demonstrate that endogenous tsad interacts with lck in cd3/cd <dig> stimulated human peripheral blood cd4+ t cells . in jurkat transient transfectants, lck co-precipitates with tsad variants 1– <dig> . upon longer exposure, a weak lck band can also be seen in immunoprecipitates of tsad lacking aa239– <dig> . in pull down experiments, lck-sh <dig> domain binds to full length tsad and tsad with truncated n-terminus  but only when co-expressed with lck . furthermore, the lck-sh <dig> domain could precipitate all tsad variants except for tsad lacking aa239– <dig>  . similar pull down experiments using the tsad-4yf and tsad d239– <dig> mutants showed that lck-sh <dig> domain interaction is dependent on the aa239– <dig>  whereas the lck-sh <dig> domain interaction is dependent on one or more of the four tyrosines within aa239– <dig> . finally, and consistent with the weak co-immunoprecipitation of lck seen with tsad aa239– <dig>  the tsad-sh <dig> domain interacted with lck in pull down experiments . taken together, these data are in accordance with our previous observation that interaction of tsad with the lck sh <dig> and the lck sh <dig> domains requires the c-terminus of tsad   <cit>  and strongly suggests that the aa239– <dig> is of major importance for tsad interaction with lck in vivo. furthermore, phosphorylation of tsad by lck is dependent on the presence of one or more of the four c-terminal tyrosines whereas the lck-sh <dig> interaction site is dispensable.

tyrosines in tsad aa239– <dig> confer the modulatory effect of tsad on lck activity
we have previously reported that tsad inhibits early t cell signalling by inhibiting lck activity  <cit> . lck is the first kinase to become activated after triggering of the tcr. phosphorylation of the itams of cd3ζ recruits zap- <dig> and zap- <dig> y <dig> becomes phosphorylated by lck or fyn  <cit> . zap- <dig> thus activated subsequently phosphorylates the transmembrane adapter lat  <cit> . phosphorylation of zap- <dig> y <dig> and lat in resting and stimulated t cells can thus be viewed as indirect measures of lck activity within the cell. immunoblots of cell lysates from cd3ε stimulated jurkat cells transiently transfected with sh2d2a variants 1– <dig> showed decreased phosphorylation of zap- <dig> y <dig> and lat, whereas in cells expressing the sh2d2a- <dig> variant or tsad-4yf no change in y <dig> or lat phosphorylation was observed . taken together, these data show that the tyrosines in tsad aa239– <dig> is essential not only for tsad phosphorylation by and interaction with lck, but also the modulating effect of tsad on lck activity.

nuclear localisation of tsad depends on the tsad-sh <dig> domain as well as aa239–334
the localisation of tsad was initially found to be cytosolic  <cit> , but was later also shown to be nuclear in activated t cells. tsad was thus proposed to play a role in transcriptional regulation  <cit> . here we used immunocytochemistry to assess the intracellular localisation of ha-tagged tsad variants transiently expressed in jurkat tag cells. the nuclear membrane protein lap- <dig> was used as a marker for the nuclear membrane. similar to full length tsad, n-terminally truncated tsad variants were localised both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. in contrast, tsad with disrupted sh <dig> domain or tsad without aa239– <dig> were only found in the cytoplasm . thus nuclear localisation of tsad depends not only on the tsad-sh <dig> domain  <cit>  but also on the tsad c-terminal sequence aa239– <dig> 

discussion
alternative transcription may extend the repertoire of functionally different proteins expressed from one single gene. in this study, alternative transcript variants of sh2d2a were used as a tool to identify functionally relevant structures of tsad. we found that tsad variants displayed different functional features, indicating that differential expression of sh2d2a transcript variants may contribute to the regulation of tsad function.

our findings are summarised in figure 7a. we revealed a prominent role for aa239– <dig> encoded by sh2d2a exon  <dig> in controlling tsad interaction with lck, modulation of proximal tcr signalling as well as translocation of tsad to the nucleus, indicating that tsad function may be regulated through alternative splicing of exon  <dig>  in addition, the tsad n-terminus and the sh <dig> domain affected tsad phosphorylation by lck.

in support of the notion that tsad aa239– <dig> is important for tsad function, a high stringency scansite search  <cit>  of possible protein interaction motifs in tsad encoded by sh2d2a- <dig> revealed that several possible ligands for sh <dig> and sh <dig> domains, as well as tyrosine kinase substrates are encoded by exon  <dig> and are thus contained within aa239– <dig> . a low stringency search also revealed one possible sh <dig> and several possible sh <dig> interaction sites encoded outside of exon  <dig> . however, a scansite search is limited in that functionally relevant motifs may not appear in searches using the motif algorithms currently available. in particular, although our present studies indicate a role for the n-terminus in modulating tsad tyrosine phosphorylation, no interaction motif is found by scansite in the tsad n-terminus. the motif database underlying scansite searches are based on high affinity interactions as determined by selection of peptides from expression libraries. recently, peptides representing all cytoplasmic phosphorylation sites of the four members of the egfr receptor family were tested for binding to all sh <dig> domains in the genome using plasmon resonance  <cit> . in those instances where a consensus sh <dig> domain binding motif was available in scansite, there were only partial overlap between the egfr motives predicted from scansite analysis and the egfr motives found to bind to the recombinant sh <dig> domains  <cit> . it thus remains to be determined whether tsad encoded by sh2d2a- <dig> is able to interact with other proteins in an sh <dig> domain independent manner.

previous studies on tsad and murine homologue lad supports the notion that motives in the aa239– <dig> are functionally important. we previously reported that lck activity is modulated by the c-terminus of tsad  <cit> , and choi et al reported that the isolated lad-sh <dig> domain is unable to modulate lck activity  <cit> . recently marti et al reported that both the three c-terminus lad tyrosines and a predicted lck-sh <dig> interaction site in the c-terminal of lad influenced lad modulation of lck activity  <cit> . moreover, grb <dig> interacts with lad y <dig> , and y <dig> and y <dig>  mediates pdgf induced ap- <dig> transcriptional activity  <cit> . thus, taken together these previous studies as well as the present study strongly point to a role for tsad aa239–aa <dig> in control of various functions of tsad.

differential regulation of the expression of functionally distinct alternate transcripts from a single gene may contribute to the regulation of the gene's function. we found that the alternative tsad transcripts may constitute up to 15–30% of the total amount of sh2d2a mrna in the cd4+ t cell. at the protein level, we showed that in cd4+ t cells, although the full length tsad  <dig> kda band dominate, also tsad of  <dig> kda lacking the aa239– <dig> is expressed. however, we did not reliably observe protein bands representing n-terminally truncated tsad variants. when expressed in jurkat t cells or 293t cells, each of the sh2d2a cdnas produced tsad molecules of expected lengths , indicating that all tsad variant mrnas encoded by the plasmid constructs were also translated. when co-transfecting jurkat t cells with sh2d2a- <dig> cdna together with 10% of the amount of sh2d2a- <dig> cdna, we were not able to detect the sh2d2a- <dig> protein band on western blots, although the sh2d2a- <dig> cdna when transfected alone did reveal a distinct protein band of expected length . this indicates that the n-terminally truncated tsad molecules fall below the detection limit of global tsad western blot analysis. in order to directly assess the expression of variant tsad molecules antibodies specifically recognizing one but not any of the other tsad molecules must be generated. however, the sequence differences between the various tsad molecules are minimal, and the predicted antigenicity as assessed by the program "antigenic" of the emboss suite  <cit>  of the n-terminal tsad amino acids, as well as the exon 6– <dig> boundary is not favourable. at present it is therefore not possible to determine to what extent these transcript variants are also represented at the protein level.

we were not able to demonstrate differential regulation of the different alternate transcripts of the sh2d2a gene in anti-cd <dig> stimulated cd4+ t cells. however, we have only examined expression of tsad transcripts in one cell type under one stimulatory regimen. physiological t cell activation also requires the presence of co-stimulatory signals delivered through cd28-b <dig> interactions. in addition, tsad mrna expression may be induced in cd4+ t cells via camp dependent signals  <cit> . since the initial cloning and characterisation of tsad  <cit> , tsad has also been found to be expressed in endothelial  <cit>  and epithelial cells  <cit> . it is possible that the pattern of sh2d2a transcripts differ in these cells.

the importance of the sh <dig> domain for nuclear translocation of tsad was previously pointed out by marti et al  <cit> . here we extend these data by showing that also the aa239– <dig> of tsad is necessary for translocation of tsad to the nucleus. tsad does not contain a nuclear localisation signal, but are associated with the molecular chaperone valocin-containing protein/p <dig> , and this interaction is thought to be necessary for translocation of tsad to the nucleus  <cit> . how tsad interacts physically with vcp is not yet known. the isolated tsad-sh <dig> domain has been shown to be translocated to the nucleus  <cit> . it is however conceivable that the intact tsad molecule may have different requirements for interaction with vcp and translocation to the nucleus, as indicated by our observation that truncated tsad with intact sh <dig> domain fails to be translocated to the nucleus.

the  <dig> aa insertion in the sh <dig> domain of the tsad protein encoded by the sh2d2a- <dig> cdna probably result in a misfolded sh <dig> domain. this variant behaved like tsad harbouring in vitro generated point mutation of the conserved arginine in the sh <dig> domain   supporting this notion. the sh2d2a- <dig> transcript was not consistently observed in quantitative pcr analysis of anti-cd <dig> stimulated cd4+ t cells, and it is thus probably expressed at very low levels in t cells. taken together, this indicates that the sh2d2a- <dig> transcript has no functional relevance in the cell and probably represents transcriptional noise.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated functional differences between tsad molecules encoded by alternative transcript variants of the sh2d2a gene, and these studies have pointed out a crucial role for aa239– <dig> encoded by exon  <dig> in mediating tsad function . further studies are needed to assess to what extent differential regulation of the alternate sh2d2a transcripts may contribute to the regulation of tsad function in t cells and other cell types.
