BACKGROUND
there is growing concern regarding current and future environmental changes worldwide, such as increases in average air and sea temperatures and altered rainfall patterns, and the abiotic stresses that they impose on biological systems  <cit> . plant adaptations to such stresses involve complex signal transduction pathways  <cit> , and elucidating the associated gene expression networks  <cit> , in order to develop strategies to enhance the stress tolerance of crops , is an important objective of agricultural biotechnology.

many studies have investigated plant stress tolerance using transcriptional profiling, thereby revealing differences between control and stress-treated plants in the relative expression levels of genes encoding stress response regulators and their target proteins  <cit> . however, while typically more than 90 % of a eukaryotic genome is transcribed, only 1–2 % is translated into proteins  <cit> , and indeed, in addition to stress-inducible regulatory proteins and transcription factors, micrornas  are also known to regulate plant stress responses . mirnas are a class of small noncoding rnas that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level by mrna cleavage or translational inhibition of the target gene  <cit> . there are currently > <dig>  plant mirna sequences from > <dig> plant species in the mirbase database   <cit>  including  <dig> from rice  mirna sequences. several mirnas have been reported to regulate drought-responsive genes  <cit> , and it has been shown that rice mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> are drought-inducible, while the expression of mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> is suppressed by drought  <cit> . in addition, mir <dig> and mir <dig> expression is either increased or repressed, depending on the specific drought conditions  <cit> . drought-induced mirnas downregulate their target transcripts, whereas drought-induced suppression of mirnas results in the increased accumulation of their target transcripts  <cit> . for example, mir <dig> is down-regulated under drought stress in arabidopsis thaliana, whereas its target gene, nfya <dig>  is drought-induced  <cit> . phenotypic analysis of mutants, or transgenic plants in which the expression of either stress-responsive mirnas or their target genes have been manipulated, has been used to determine the role of mirnas under different stress conditions  <cit> .

another class of noncoding rnas are the long noncoding rnas , which can be classified into five categories: i) sense and ii) antisense, when there is overlap of different transcripts in the same, or opposite, strand, respectively; iii) bidirectional, when the expression of an lncrnas and a neighboring coding transcript on the opposite strand is initiated in close genomic proximity; iv) intronic, when it is derived wholly from within an intron of a second transcript; and v) intergenic, when it lies within the genomic interval between two genes  <cit> . numerous lncrnas have been associated with responses to abiotic stress, such as the expression of  <dig>  lncrnas that were reported to be regulated by various abiotic stresses in a. thaliana  <cit> ,  <dig> lncrnas that were identified under drought and heat stress conditions in wheat   <cit>  and several drought-responsive and tissue-specific maize  lncrnas  <cit> .

in this current study, rna-sequencing  transcript profiling was used to evaluate the levels of noncoding rnas, including pri-mirnas and lncrnas, in well-watered control and drought-treated rice plants. a total of  <dig> drought-responsive mirna precursors , which have not previously been characterized in rice, were identified. the expression levels of some of these were shown, by qrt-pcr, to have a negative correlation with the expression of their candidate target genes. in addition, parallel analysis of rna ends  libraries from various rice tissues enabled the identification of decay intermediates generated by mirna-guided cleavages  <cit> , and a total of  <dig> drought-responsive lncrnas and their sense or antisense transcripts were detected. the combined data sets suggest potential roles for specific rice mirnas under drought conditions.

RESULTS
exposure of rice plants to conditions that mimic natural drought stress
rice plants were grown in a greenhouse for 5 weeks before being subjected to drought stress. to mimic natural drought stress, drought conditions were imposed by withholding water for  <dig> d, until a soil water content of < 10 % was measured. leaves of drought stressed plants were compared to those of control plants grown under normal irrigation conditions. after a day, the soil moisture content dropped to 50 % of the initial soil capacity and rice plants started to show visual symptoms of drought-induced damage, such as leaf rolling . all the leaves from drought-treated plants showed a greater degree of leaf rolling as the level of drought stress increased. consequently, the rice plants were severely affected by drought after  <dig> d . in addition to the phenotypic assessment, we measured the expression of the dip <dig>  and rbcs <dig>  genes, whose expression has been reported to be drought-inducible and drought-repressed, respectively  <cit> . dip <dig> expression was observed to increase at  <dig> d, and continued to increase up to  <dig> d, whereas transcript levels of rbcs <dig> progressively decreased until  <dig> d after the imposition of drought conditions .fig.  <dig> drought response phenotype of rice in the vegetative state. a the phenotypic effect of progressive drought on wild type rice  at the vegetative growth stage. drought stress was initiated 40 days after germination, and the plants shown are a well-watered control and at day  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> after drought initiation. b decrease in soil water content during drought treatment. soil moisture in the pots was monitored using a sm <dig> soil moisture sensor . volts  is the sm <dig> output value. blue bar, control; red bar, drought condition. the conversion from sm <dig> reading  to soil moisture  can be calculated by − <dig>  +  <dig>  v- <dig>  v2 +  <dig>  v3- <dig>  v4 +  <dig>  v <dig> . c the transcript levels of dip <dig> and rbcs <dig> in the leaves of drought-treated and well-watered control plants over a time course of exposure to drought were measured by qrt-pcr analysis. values shown are the means ± sd of three independent experiments and are presented relative to the results from the control. dip <dig>  and rbcs <dig>  served as stress marker genes



rna-seq analysis
total rna was extracted from the leaves of drought treated and well-watered plants and used to construct four rna-seq libraries: one library from a well-watered control  and three libraries from drought-treated leaves . these were sequenced using an illumina hi-seq  <dig> to identify differences in expression profiles among the different libraries. sequence read information is summarized in additional file 1: table s <dig>  approximately  <dig> million single-end sequence reads were obtained and after quality trimming a total of  <dig> million sequence reads remained, corresponding to  <dig> , <dig>  bp . a flow chart of the sequencing process is shown in additional file 2: figure s <dig>  a total of 81 % of the reads could be mapped to predicted gene regions. raw sequence reads were trimmed to remove adaptor sequences and those with a quality lower than q <dig> were also removed using the clc mapping tool .

drought responsive genes were defined those that were differentially expressed between well-watered and drought-treated leaves, and we observed that among these genes, approximately twice as many were down-regulated by drought as were up-regulated in the  <dig> d and  <dig> d samples . far fewer genes were up-regulated in the  <dig> d sample. of the  <dig>  genes that could be annotated using the rap-db database ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  were up- and down-regulated, respectively, by more than 2-fold upon drought treatment for  <dig> d. similarly,  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes were up- and down-regulated, respectively, after  <dig> d, and  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes, respectively, after  <dig> d. of the genes identified as differentially expressed between treatments,  <dig> and  <dig> were up- and down-regulated, respectively, in all three drought treated samples .

the assembled contigs were annotated using the gene ontology  database blast mapping function  at the embl-ebi website . additional file 5: figure s <dig> shows the genes that could be assigned at least one go term in the three main go categories, ‘biological process’, ‘cellular component’ and ‘molecular function’.

drought-responsive mirnas and their candidate target genes
to date,  <dig> rice mirna precursors  encoding  <dig> mature mirnas have been reported , and in this current study we identified a total of  <dig> pre-mirnas in the rna-seq data sets. of those,  <dig> pre-mirnas were constitutively expressed under both normal and drought conditions at high levels, whereas  <dig> pre-mirnas were expressed at low levels . in addition, the expression levels of  <dig> pre-mirnas increased considerably upon exposure to drought stress conditions, while those of  <dig> were substantially decreased . these drought-responsive mirnas and their putative target genes, predicted by the web tool psrnatarget , are listed in additional file 8: tabular data  <dig>  for  <dig> of the pre-mirnas that were highly up-regulated in response to drought stress, their putative target genes showed a concomitant decrease in transcript levels. conversely, for  <dig> precursor mirnas that were strongly down-regulated by the drought treatment, a concomitant increase in transcript levels of their putative target genes was observed . to validate the rna-seq results and the inverse correlations in expression levels between the mirnas and their target genes, qrt-pcr was carried out using total rnas from control and drought-treated leaves. expression levels of the mirnas and their candidate target genes were again seen to be inversely correlated , consistent with their expected function in cleaving the target mrnas. qrt-pcr was also used to determine the correlation in expression of the precursor and mature mirnas, and we observed that the expression patterns of the drought-responsive mir171f-5p, mir399k, mir818b and mir156d precursors correlated well with those of the mature mirnas . interestingly, while pre-mir171f and mir171f-5p showed a drought-inducible expression pattern, the expression of mir171f-3p, which is another mature mirna derived from pre-mir171f, was affected by drought. however, this could be due to the fact that the mir171f-3p sequence is also encoded by other members of the mir <dig> family, such as pre-mir171b, pre-mir171c, pre-mir171e and pre-mir171f, which are also not responsive to drought. it is also possible that processing of pre-mir171f to generate mir171-5p or mir171-3p is differentially regulated by drought. since mir-171f-5p and mir-171f-3p have different sets of target genes, we measured the expression levels of the mir171f precursor and the putative target transcripts  in various rice tissues at different developmental stages by qrt-pcr   <cit> . the precursor mir-171f accumulated at high levels in roots, coleoptiles and flowers. conversely, transcripts of os03g0828701- <dig>  a target of mir-171f-5p, were observed in leaves, but not in roots and flowers. thus, the expression pattern of the mir-171f precursor has an inverse correlation with that of its corresponding target gene, os03g0828701- <dig>  but not with the other predicted target genes, os12g0571900- <dig>  os09g0555600- <dig> and os05g0417100- <dig>  considering the results presented in figs.  <dig> and  <dig>  we concluded that mir-171f-5p is drought-responsive, with os03g0828701- <dig> being a likely target gene.fig.  <dig> qrt-pcr confirmation of rna-seq results examining gene expression in leaves from plants grown under well-watered and drought conditions. changes in expression of precursor mirnas, mature mirnas  and putative target genes  as determined by qrt-pcr and compared with the rna-seq data. the target genes of the mirnas were predicted using the web tool, psrnatarget . bar indicated as mean values ± sd  of three independent experiments

drought-responsive lncrnas and their natural antisense transcripts 
in this study,  <dig> drought-responsive lncrnas  with over 1 kb in length and their cognate antisense transcripts were identified . a subset of the lncrnas comprise the class ‘natural antisense transcripts’ , which are complementary to other endogenous transcripts of coding or noncoding genes. these can be transcribed in cis from the same genomic locus as the target mrna, or in trans from a separate locus. of the  <dig> lncrnas,  <dig> pairs were determined to be cis-nats, i.e., two or more genes within the nat pair that are located on the opposite strands of the same genomic locus. additional  <dig> regions of bidirectional transcription were also found, which were arranged in a convergent orientation to the 5′ end or with the 3′ end overlapping. additionally,  <dig> intergenic and  <dig> sense lncrnas  were identified, and we determined that the expressions of most of the lncrnas was consistent with expression of the nearby coding or noncoding transcripts, while the expression of two nats and their candidate target genes were inversely correlated: the nat os02g0250700- <dig> and its candidate target gene os02g0250600- <dig> , and the nat os02g0180800- <dig> and its target gene os02g0180700- <dig> . the former pair shows a head-to-head genomic configuration while the latter shows a tail-to-tail configuration.

discussion
compared with natural drought conditions, where dehydration is typically gradual and progressive, experimental treatments to induce drought are often relatively severe and/or rapid. for example, widely used methods involve air drying with excised leaf disc or treating them with polyethylene glycol  <cit> . such treatments are liable to cause osmotic stress rather than drought stress, and indeed it can be difficult to distinguish between these types of stress. in this current study, we sought to analyze the molecular response of rice plants subjected to a mild drought stress, thereby mimicking natural drought conditions. transcriptome profiling was performed of leaves from rice plants grown at either 75 %, 40 %, 10 % or 7 % residual soil moisture content , where drought stress damage was carefully monitored using the expression of dip <dig> and rbcs <dig> as markers for drought-inducible and drought-sensitive expression, respectively. we then examined the rna-seq data to identify differentially expressed genes involved in drought responses.

amongst the genes that were found to be associated with the drought response and that were differentially expressed between well-watered and water-deficit conditions, we identified both drought induced genes, including late embryogenesis abundant , calcium-dependent membrane targeting domain protein , and drought repressed genes, such as a-type response regulator,  . in addition, a total of  <dig> drought-responsive pre-mirnas were identified,  <dig> which were drought-induced and  <dig> of which were drought-repressed by more than 2-fold. of the  <dig> rice pre-mirnas,  <dig> are identified as being drought-responsive for the first time in this study . sixty-six pre-mirnas could be assigned to  <dig> mirna families, while  <dig> did not belong to any family. interestingly, two members of the mir <dig> family, pre-mir399k and pre-mir399d, were up-regulated by drought stress, while other two members, pre-mir399e and pre-mir399i, were down-regulated by drought stress. similarly, some members of the mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> families  were up-regulated while others  were down-regulated by drought stress. these results suggest that members of the same mirna family are functionally diverse during drought responses. a number of drought-responsive mirnas have been identified ; however, we found that the expression patterns of  <dig> pre-mirnas  were different under the drought treatments used in this study from those previously reported  <cit> . this discrepancy may be due to different ages of the tissues used or the way in which the drought treatments were imposed. it is also possible that the expression patterns between the mature mirnas and pre-mirnas are different during drought conditions.

experimental validation of the putative mirna paired target genes has been a major focus in the investigation of mirna function  <cit> . of the differentially expressed precursor mirnas and their putative target genes,  <dig> were confirmed by qrt-pcr , and the expression level of these genes confirmed the accuracy of the rna-seq data. under drought-stress conditions, the transcription of stress-responsive mirnas and their putative targets can be independently regulated. indeed, the expression patterns of some of the pre-mirnas were positively correlated with those of their target genes . conversely, many drought-responsive mirnas and their targets showed a negative correlation in their expression patterns, i.e., drought-induced mirnas downregulated their target mrnas, while drought-repressed mirnas upregulated their target mrnas . thus, a given target gene may either promote or suppress processes during stress adaptation responses. drought-responsive mirna-mediated target cleavages were also confirmed by analyzing publically available pare data . some mirnas, such as mir819d, mir171f, mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir819i, have a large number of putative target genes. additional file 8: tabular data  <dig> shows that the candidate target genes were up- or down-regulated in an opposite manner to the change in mirna expression, e.g., mir171f and its targets, scarecrow-like  <dig> and the morn motif containing protein, and mir <dig> and its target squamosa-promoter binding protein. mir171f has previously been observed to be responsive to salt, drought and cold stress in a. thaliana  <cit> , and two mature mir171fs, mir171f-3p and mir171f-5p, were reported to be down-regulated under drought conditions in rice  <cit> . however, our results showed that the pre-mir171f and the mature mir171f-5p, but not mir171f-3p, were drought-inducible and that the expression level of the candidate target gene, os03g0828701- <dig>  was inversely correlated with that of mir171f-5p under drought conditions. the negative-correlation patterns between mir171f and os03g0828701- <dig> were also found at various developmental stages of rice , thereby providing insights into the function of mir171f, especially mir171f-5p, in the adaptive response of plants to drought stress at various development stages. pre-mirna expression profiling with rna-seq and qrt-pcr of various developmental stages reveals that mir171f is involved in rice root growth and development as well as in responses to drought. recently, it has been shown that virus infection specifically induces mir17f-5p expression in rice  <cit> . given that mature the mir171f-3p sequence is also encoded by several other members of the mir <dig> family and that it is conserved to recognize target genes encoding gras family transcription factors, the pre-mir171f / os03g0828701- <dig> module may be specifically developed to be involved in drought responses, developmental processes, and resistance to viral infection.

it was recently reported that a total of  <dig>  long noncoding natural antisense transcripts  are associated with 70 % of the annotated mrnas in a. thaliana  <cit> . in addition,  <dig> putative stress responsive lncrnas from wheat have been reported  <cit> , as well as  <dig>  putative maize lncrnas  <cit> . zhang et al. identified  <dig>  lncrnas by sequencing strand-specific rnas from various rice organs, including anthers, pistils, seeds, and shoots  <cit> . we found a total of  <dig> lncrnas whose expression changed in response to drought  and their expression levels were positively correlated with those of their putative target genes. interestingly, two lncrnas, os02g0250700- <dig> and os02g0180800- <dig>  are bidirectional, and their potential targets are present on the neighboring opposite strand. os02g0250700- <dig> and its target gene, os02g0250600- <dig>  was shown to share a single bidirectional promoter, and their expression is inversely correlated, as was the expression of os02g0180800- <dig> and its target gene, os02g0180700- <dig>  under drought conditions.

noncoding rnas have been identified in many plant species, such as a. thaliana, maize, wheat, soybean  and rice; however, functional analysis is still challenging. here, we identified drought responsive noncoding rnas of the mirna and lncrna categories. the identification and expression pattern analysis of the rice precursor mirnas and lncrnas represents a resource for investigating how the extensive set of noncoding rnas in the genome function and interact during drought stress and in regulating development.

CONCLUSIONS
in this current study, we identified drought responsive noncoding rnas by using rna-seq profiling on well-watered control and drought-treated rice plants. a total of  <dig> drought-responsive mirna precursors , which have not previously been characterized in rice, were identified. the expression levels of some of these were shown to have a negative correlation with those of their candidate target genes. those mirna/target pairs were further validated by parallel analysis of rna ends  libraries from various rice tissues that enabled us to identify decay intermediates generated by mirna-guided cleavages. in addition, a total of  <dig> drought-responsive lncrnas  and their sense or antisense transcripts were detected. the combined data sets suggest potential roles for specific rice noncoding rnas under drought conditions.
