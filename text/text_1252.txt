BACKGROUND
the emerging regulatory roles of rna in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms are expanding the central dogma of molecular biology. while the full spectrum of cellular functions regulated by small non-coding rna  are yet to be established, work is going on to identify and study the role of non-coding regulatory rnas in biological systems. in bacteria alone, more than  <dig> srnas are described  <cit> . the majority were identified in e. coli, and their functional characterization showed that they perform regulatory roles in sugar metabolism  <cit> , iron homeostasis  <cit>  and cell surface composition. in bacteria, srna also mediates post-transcriptional gene regulation, which can be important in virulence  <cit> . large-scale identification of srnas is a necessary step towards understanding their functions in normal bacterial physiology and virulence.

s. pneumoniae, a gram-positive human pathogen, is the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia and a leading cause of meningitis, sinusitis, chronic bronchitis, and otitis media  <cit> . pneumococci cause approximately  <dig>  invasive infections and  <dig>  deaths every year in the united states alone  <cit> . there is a precedent for srna involvement in pneumococcal physiology and virulence. investigation of the ciarh regulon in s. pneumoniae strain r <dig> using classic molecular biology and genetic approaches resulted in the identification of  <dig> promoters which are regulated by ciarh, of which five encodes srnas  <cit> . this two component regulatory system ciarh is involved in maintaining cell integrity, competence and virulence. expression of these srnas was confirmed by northern blots, and analysis of srna mutants showed that two of these srnas were important for stationary phase autolysis. two srnas identified by experimental approaches in streptococcus pneumoniae strain d <dig> had demonstrated cis-acting effects on the transcription of adjacent genes  <cit> . thus there is a need for increased identification of non-coding functional elements in the pneumococcal genome.

a number of computational as well as experimental approaches have been described for identifying srnas in bacteria  <cit> . computational methods usually rely upon srna conservation in closely related species  <cit>  and are often limited to accuracy of transcriptional signal prediction programs . although computational prediction of srnas in s. pneumoniae tigr <dig> using program srnapredict <dig>  <cit>  resulted in a list of  <dig> srnas, only nine were validated by northern blotting in s. pneumoniae d <dig> strain  <cit> . this lack of agreement between computational prediction and experimental validation necessitates experimental approaches. experimental methods for srna identification include genetic and molecular biology approaches  <cit> . nowadays, genomic tiling arrays and rna-seq methods are commonly used for genome-wide transcriptome analysis in bacteria  <cit> . expression in the intergenic regions of e. coli and mycobacterium leprae were identified using tiling arrays, suggesting the likely expression of small non-coding rnas  <cit> . a recent study identified  <dig> srnas in caulobacter crescentus using tiling array approach  <cit> . using parallel sequencing, a large number of putative srnas were reported in vibrio cholerae  <cit> . immunoprecipitation with hfq  antibody followed by deep sequencing identified  <dig> srnas in salmonella typhimurium  <cit> . a total of  <dig> srnas identified by molecular biology techniques are described in s. pneumoniae . to date, global experimental approaches for srna identification in the streptococcus pneumoniae have not been reported. here we describe a genomic tiling array approach for comprehensive identification of srnas in s. pneumoniae serotype  <dig> clinical isolate tigr <dig>  we used whole genome tiling arrays for these analyses because they offer an unbiased view of transcription at the genome level. another reason was absence of hfq protein in s. pneumoniae which eliminates the possibility of immunoprecipitation based identification of srnas.

s. pneumoniae tigr <dig> genomic tiling arrays identified  <dig> novel srnas in genome, thirteen of which were validated by qrt-pcr. computational analysis for predicting the function of tigr <dig> srnas was conducted using rfam database searches, blast searches and sequence motif analysis. tiling arrays also identified  <dig> operon structures expressed in tigr <dig>  overall, our results provide new insights towards understanding the complex regulatory network of the pneumococcus and underscore the importance of genomic features present in non-coding regions.

RESULTS
transcriptionally active regions in tigr <dig> genome
a fundamental aspect unique to tiling array data analysis workflow was defining the baseline for the identification of expressed regions of the genome. fluorescence intensities of spiked positive and/or negative control probes included in the array design are often used for identifying a probe level threshold for expression. rna for the tiling array experiment was isolated from s. pneumoniae strain tigr <dig>  <cit>  during mid-log phase . to derive a baseline for expression in our tiling experiment, we used random probes  spotted on the array as negative controls. for positive controls, we utilized s. pneumoniae tigr <dig> proteome data and selected  <dig> proteins known to be expressed under identical growth conditions  <cit> . to minimize sequence based effects on probe intensity, we took adjacent probe intensities into account and applied a pseudomedian filter  <cit> . the threshold for probe expression was set as  <dig>  based on the distribution of the intensities of positive and negative control probes, pseudomedian filter setting, and the accuracy of transcript boundary detection. this threshold intensity had an associated fpr  of  <dig> % . therefore, probes with intensity values ≥  <dig>  were considered to be expressed.

consecutive expressed probes were joined together for the generation of transcriptionally active regions . we identified  <dig> tars in the tigr <dig> genome, of which  <dig> were found on the nominal forward  strand and  <dig> were identified on the nominal reverse  strand. the genome size of s. pneumoniae is  <dig>  mb , of which  <dig> % is annotated as genes  <cit>  and rest  <dig> % as intergenic region. overall, our results show that 68% of the annotated regions  of the genome are expressed during mid-log phase. in addition, approximately 55% of the intergenic region was expressed which includes srnas, utr regions of mrnas, and intergenic region within operons. high level of transcription was detected in the repetitive regions present inside the intergenic regions, which were excluded from further analysis. figure  <dig>  shows the important steps involved in tiling array data analysis.

identification and sequence characterization of srnas
novel non-protein coding srnas were identified from the intergenic region of s. pneumoniae tigr <dig> genome. our results identified expression in more than 55% of the intergenic region. we excluded intergenic region within operons, small utrs  and repetitive regions  from our analysis for identifying novel srna. here we report for the first time, identification of  <dig> srnas  in the genome. the majority of the identified srnas were shorter than  <dig> nucleotides . since our tiling array design with overlapping probes arranged at  <dig> bp intervals does not provide a single nucleotide resolution, we cannot accurately identify the exact transcription start/end sited for srna. as such the start and end for srna in table  <dig> refer to the boundaries of transcriptionally active region  and in most cases a promoter is predicted within  <dig> bp of transcript start site . the overlap between the  <dig> srnas identified in this study and the  <dig> computationally predicted srnas  <cit>  reported for s. pneumoniae tigr <dig> is very small. only  <dig> srnas are shared between these two datasets of which four were validated by northern blotting  <cit> . a comparison of computationally predicted  <cit>  and experimentally verified srnas  <cit>  is available . five of the srnas  were found to be homologs  of the previously described srnas  from s. pneumoniae r <dig> strain  <cit> . the identification of all of the five previously identified pneumococcal srnas in our study, though not expected a priori, nevertheless strengthens our workflow. we utilized these five srnas as a benchmark dataset for evaluating the results of our computational analyses of srna sequences.

srna sequences conserved in; α-different streptococcus pneumoniae strains like cgsp <dig>  g <dig>  hungary19a- <dig>  r <dig>  d <dig>  β-different species of streptococcus like s. mitis, s. gordonii, s. sanguinis sk <dig>  ¥-other species outside streptococcaceae . the start and end represents the boundaries of identified tar  which is a potential srna region.

the expression of srnas showed a strong bias towards the forward strand  relative to the reverse strand  even though the distribution of protein coding genes in tigr <dig> is almost equal for both strands of dna. we found that the tigr <dig> genome has gene orientation bias, a common feature of low-gc  organisms. approximately, half of the total genes were located to the right of the origin of replication, of which 79% are transcribed in the same direction as dna replication and vice versa  <cit>  . since two thirds of the identified srnas were located to the right of origin of replication, the majority of the srnas in our study were expressed in the forward strand.

transcription is usually facilitated by promoter sequences located in the 5' upstream region on same strand of dna. earlier comparative genomics studies also have reported the presence of rho-independent transcription terminators as evidence for the identification of srna  <cit> . both promoter and rho-independent terminators were also experimentally identified in the five homologs of previously identified pneumococcal srnas from r <dig> strain  <cit> . the results of computational analysis for promoter/terminator showed that most of the srnas had a predicted promoter within  <dig> nt upstream of the tar start site. in some cases more than one promoter was predicted in the upstream region of srna sequence. rho-independent transcription terminators were predicted for  <dig> srnas within  <dig> bp downstream of transcription end site. the predicted promoter sequence with transcription start site and terminator sequences for srnas are present . we also evaluated the potential protein coding capacity of srnas by translating the sequences in all three open reading frames. our results indicate that two srnas  encoding regions have the potential to code smaller proteins. further analysis of the dna sequence in these regions using "fgenesb" gene prediction tool http://www.softberry.com identified the presence of smaller orf . we did not find any predicted promoter sequences in the upstream regions of these two srnas, suggesting they may constitute part of an operon. further analysis revealed that sn <dig> is indeed located in a four gene operon . blast based sequence searches against non-redundant protein database at ncbi did not identify any matches for these two srnas in other genomes suggesting that these potential novel genes are currently unique to s. pneumoniae tigr <dig>  while sn <dig> and sn <dig> could encode proteins, in absence of experimental validation of orf, it is not possible to rule out their functional involvement as a srna. therefore we included sn <dig> and sn <dig> in our srna list .

comparative genomics of srna sequences
the average gc content of srnas  was slightly less than the average gc content of the tigr <dig> genome . blast analysis of srna sequences against the non-redundant nucleotide database at ncbi revealed that all srna sequences were highly conserved  within other pneumococcal strains . but only  <dig> is found to be conserved in closely related species of streptococcus   <cit> . however, these srnas were not conserved in other species of streptococcus like s. pyogenes, s. mutans, or s. bovis. this lack of srna sequence conservation at the genus level indicates that these srnas might have been acquired during pneumococcal evolution. six srna sequences were found to be conserved in other species outside streptococcaceae  and are known to be involved in various regulatory functions.

computational functional prediction of srnas
srnas can be functionally characterized as either cis- or trans- regulators based on the location of their target genes. the rfam database  <cit>  is a collection of non-coding rna families represented by multiple sequence alignments and profile stochastic context-free grammars. we searched all tigr <dig> srna sequences against the rfam database to determine their putative functions. we found that some of the pneumococcal srnas we identified were homologs to well characterized srnas in other genomes. the identified functional categories include fmn riboswitches, tpp riboswitch, pyrr family, tbox leader elements, r-protein leader autoregulatory structure, putative endoribonuclease , tmrna, and 6s . with rfam database searches we could assign putative functions to  <dig> srnas,  <dig> of which were predicted to be cis-regulators. three of the cis-srnas were predicted riboswitches that could directly bind a small target molecule. for  <dig> srnas we could not predict function using computational methods. these srnas likely represent a novel set of non-coding srnas in pneumococci.

motif and structural analysis of srna sequences
to identify sequence characteristics among the pneumococcal srnas, we searched for the presence of overrepresented sequence motifs using meme suite  <cit> . a sequence motif is a nucleotide sequence pattern that is widespread and has, or is predicted to have, structural or biological significance. all srna sequences were used for motif prediction, and the top  <dig> motifs  were selected based on high score, length , and p-value . our results indicate that srnas predicted to have similar functions share common motif sequences . all members of motif group m <dig> and m <dig> were functionally similar, the five srnas which were homologs of ciarh regulated srna in s. pneumoniae r <dig> strain. similarly, members of motif group m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig> share similar functions.

we also investigated secondary structure of motif sequences based on mfold predicted srna structures  <cit> . our results showed that in most motif groups, the srna sequences had similar motif structures . motif m <dig> always forms a partial stem loop-like structure in all five srnas , while motif m <dig> forms a large unpaired segment. motif m <dig> in sn <dig> and sn <dig> assumes a partial stem loop structure while a large portion of the sequence still remains unpaired. motifs m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  and m <dig> form stem loop structures in corresponding srna sequences. motifs m <dig> and m <dig> includes two stem loop structures along with the unpaired region between them. the  <dig> srnas that had no detectable sequence motifs could represent a set of diverse sequences having different mode of action.

searching these motifs in motif database using tomtom  <cit>  results in identification of motif m <dig> associated with pyrr  regulated function, similar to srnas  predicted function. motif m <dig> was identified to be a part of antiteminator binding region in regulatory protein, pyrr, where it regulates the transcription of pyr operon by attenuation mechanism  <cit> . we also analyzed two motifs m <dig>  m <dig> that were present in the srnas whose functions are well described in literature. motif m <dig> was found to be a part of aptamer structure  of fmn riboswitches  <cit> . motif m <dig> was found to be present in the conserved part of the specifier loop of t-box regulated genes  <cit> . t-box antitermination is considered as one of the main mechanisms to regulate gene expression in amino acid metabolism in gram-positive bacteria. the other described motifs could represent important novel structural or functional regions to be investigated.

gene expression profile and identification of operon structures
our results indicate that ~50% of s. pneumoniae tigr <dig> genes were expressed during mid-log growth phase. we characterized the set of expressed genes, which represent basal transcriptional activity under our growth condition, using tigrfams . the expressed genes are involved in fundamental biological processes such as transcription, protein synthesis, protein fate, and cell division . processes such as fatty acid and phospholipid metabolism were also represented in the expression profile. we found that approximately 40% of the expressed genes were involved in processes mediating dna metabolism, regulatory functions, and signal transduction. almost all genes with mobile and extra-chromosomal functions were expressed. genes encoding surface proteins, proteins involved in acquiring nutrients, and transporters were also expressed  <cit> . interestingly, one third of the annotated hypothetical genes  and around half of the genes annotated as disrupted reading frames  were expressed.

in bacteria genes involved in carrying out similar function are often organized into operon structures. identifying operon structures is critical for understanding coordinated regulation of bacterial transcriptome. identifying transcriptional units can also help in assigning function to hypothetical genes when present in an operon of known function  <cit> . tiling arrays efficiently identify co-expressed genes and transcription units at a genomic scale. we identified co-expression for  <dig> pairs of tigr <dig> genes  that were transcribed together and constituted minimal operons. by joining consecutive overlapping pairs of co-expressed genes, we identified  <dig> distinct transcription units/operons .

the operons identified in this study were compared to previously described pneumococcal operons . the vic, man, atp, and marmp operons identified by tiling arrays concur with previously described operon structures  <cit> . in s. pneumoniae r <dig>  marmp operon is considered to have three genes . in contrast, our results identified only two genes as transcription unit . our data clearly shows that the expression of sp <dig> is higher than sp <dig> - sp <dig> , suggests that sp <dig> is either expressed as an independent transcription unit or there exists a possibility of overlapping transcripts among these three genes. we did not identify murmn, phg, and comcde operon expression, suggesting that these genes may not be required for mid-log growth phase. lack of expression of competence related genes is expected as thb medium used for propagating s. pneumoniae does not support competence.

comparing our experimentally identified co-expressed genes with computationally predicted operons using "door"  <cit>  showed that there was an approximately 63% overlap between both datasets . thus, our dataset experimentally validates  <dig> door gene-pair predictions. tiling array expression analysis also identified  <dig> additional co-expressed gene-pairs that were not predicted by door, which may help in refining the boundaries of identified transcriptional units with greater accuracy. for example, door predicted the s <dig> operon  in tigr <dig> as a  <dig> gene operon . however, tiling analysis indicated that the s <dig> operon has  <dig> genes  and included sp <dig> . interestingly, we found that bacillus subtilis s <dig> operon structure is similar to our experimentally derived pneumococcal s <dig> operon structure   <cit> . one possible reason for the exclusion of sp <dig> by door could be the relatively large  <dig> bp intergenic region between sp <dig> and sp <dig>  in another example, tiling expression identified rplk-rpla  genes as part of single transcriptional unit, but door failed to identify this unit possibly due to the presence of a large  <dig> bp intergenic region between rplk and rpla.

proteins encoded by genes in the same operon often have related function or are in the same biological pathway. therefore, putative function may be assigned to hypothetical genes when located in an operon of known function  <cit> . in our operon dataset, approximately 20%  of the genes encode hypothetical proteins. in operon  <dig>  a three gene operon , two genes encode trk family of potassium uptake proteins, and one gene  encodes a hypothetical protein. therefore, it is possible that sp <dig> may be a member of the trk transporter protein family. in another three gene operon , all genes encode hypothetical proteins; it is possible these proteins have similar as yet un-assigned functions.

experimental validation of srnas
expression of  <dig> srnas identified by genomic tiling expression analysis was analyzed by qrt-pcr. the srnas selected for validation included  <dig> srnas identified in s. pneumoniae r <dig> strain and  <dig> novel tigr <dig> srnas identified in the current study. statistical t-tests were performed for each srna between the ct value for the  vs the ct value of the background  to determine if there was significantly higher expression than background. another t-test was conducted for each srna between the ct value for the reverse strand vs the ct value for the forward strand to determine if there was significant expression from the sense strand. at p ≤  <dig> , for  <dig> srnas we found significantly higher expression  for the coding strand specific qrt-pcr compared to the non-coding strand and background  . the p-value of srna sn <dig> was not significant at p <  <dig> . three of the validated srnas  had available annotations . although validated, no functional information was predicted for srnas sn <dig>  sn <dig>  sn <dig> and sn <dig>  all five srnas whose homologs were present in s. pneumoniae r <dig> strain were also positively validated. overall, qrt-pcr validations were successful for thirteen out of fourteen srnas.

discussion
tiling array analysis is widely used in eukaryotes to study transcriptional complexity and identifying non-coding transcripts  <cit> . recent studies in mycobacterium leprae and e.coli described whole genome tiling array approach for srna identification  <cit> . parallel sequencing technology was used for srna identification in salmonella  <cit>  and vibrio cholerae  <cit> . individual experimental studies  <cit>  altogether identified  <dig> srnas in two different strains of s. pneumoniae . to our knowledge, this is the first study to report the use of whole genome tiling arrays for experimental identification of srnas at a global scale in s. pneumoniae. the tiling array analysis method described here is a combination of the methods described by others  <cit> , but tailored for prokaryotic genomes. hfq protein plays a central role in srna function in e. coli, facilitating the pairing of srna with its mrna target  <cit> . one experimental approach for srna identification in bacteria could be the co-immunoprecipitation of srna using hfq antibodies  <cit> . however, s. pneumoniae tigr <dig> genome does not code for hfq protein which precludes applying this method to tigr <dig> genome. therefore, tiling array approach described in this study is a pragmatic experimental approach for identifying srnas. identifying the srna repertoire of tigr <dig> is the first step towards understanding the srna regulatory network of this human pathogen.

the transcriptome map generated in this study identified expression in two thirds of tigr <dig> genome. tiling array analyses of e. coli and yeast reported expression of 87% and 90% of the genome respectively  <cit> . compared to these studies, tigr <dig> genome expression in this study was relatively in lower proportion . possible reasons for this lower expression could be the growth conditions and/or the stringent intensity cutoff used for identification of expressed regions. we choose a stringent intensity cutoff  to maintain a low false positive rate  for identifying srnas, which are usually short in length .

as a result, we report for the first time genome-wide identification of  <dig> novel srnas in pneumococcus using tiling arrays. additional features, such as presence of a promoter and rho-independent terminator, were computationally predicted for identified srnas. almost half of the identified srnas showed the presence of a rho-independent terminator. as speculated by others  <cit> , our analysis indicates that identification of rho-independent terminator sequence is the strongest determinant for the identification of srna. furthermore, the identification of rho-independent terminator downstream from srna sequences helped us in differentiating the srnas from the 5' untranslated extensions of genes. however, it is possible that some srnas may be associated with a rho-dependent terminator and thus would not be identified in our search.

comparative genomics of srna sequences revealed that only six srna sequences involved in various regulatory activities were conserved beyond streptococcaceae . the evolutionary tree of streptococcus family  <cit>  indicates that s. mitis, s. gordonii, s. sanguinis sk <dig> are phylogenetically closer to s. pneumoniae than other species  which explains the conservation of  <dig> srnas in s. mitis, s. gordonii, and s. sanguinis sk36), but not present in other species like s. pyogenes, s. mutans, or s. bovis.. it also indicates that srna prediction algorithms that rely on comparative genomics need to first account for the observed low sequence conservation of srnas among different species  <cit> . our results suggest that computational methods which rely on comparative genomics to find srnas need to focus on carefully selected closely related species. the  <dig> srnas identified in this study along with their comparative genomics could serve as a training dataset for further computational srna predictions in pneumococcus, particularly for the identification of srnas which are not expressed under our experimental conditions. at last, we speculate that computational prediction of streptococcus srnas using comparative genomics with s. mitis, s. gordonii, and s. sanguinis sk <dig> will identify new as yet undescribed srnas.

exploring the sequence characteristics of srnas described in this study showed that srnas predicted to have similar biological function share common sequence motif. we identified  <dig> sequence motifs, of which five were identified in tigr <dig> for the first time. members of the motif group without predicted function could have similar structural or functional properties. for example sn <dig> had motif m <dig> and might function as a fmn switch similar to sn <dig> and sn <dig>  which also contain this motif. likewise, srnas present in motif group m <dig> could be predicted to have similar yet undefined function. structural analysis of motif  suggests that they mainly form two kinds of structure in srnas; firstly, the whole motif forms a stem loop structure  and secondly, the motif is present as two stem loop structures including the unpaired region between them . furthermore, motifs present in srnas with similar function also formed a conserved secondary structure . we speculate that , , ,  contains similar motif structure and might share similar yet unknown structure/function. this structural conservation of motifs also suggests that motif regions of srna could be structurally or functionally important regions and can be used as targets for mutational studies to decipher function.

the accuracy of computational operon prediction in bacteria is 85-91% in terms of specificity and sensitivity for predicting operonic gene pairs  in e. coli and b. subtilis, respectively  <cit> . however, the sensitivity of prediction drops to as low as 50% when predicting transcription units with more than one gene  <cit> . two examples were discussed in results where the computational prediction failed to identify a gene pair as a part of an operon due to the presence of a large intergenic region between them. the accuracy of computational operon prediction algorithms also decreases when performing predictions for newly sequenced genomes for which no training dataset is available. based on tiling array analysis, we generated  <dig> gene pairs that were co-expressed and identified  <dig> transcription units in s. pneumoniae tigr <dig>  our results clearly demonstrate the effective use of tiling arrays for operon identification at a whole genome scale. an obvious limitation to the tiling array approach is the inability to identify operons whose genes are not expressed in the experimental growth condition. nevertheless, our results demonstrate that combining operons identified by tiling with computational prediction greatly improves operon identification in genomes, as speculated by other researchers  <cit> . the operons identified in this study, though not comprehensive, still represent a validated dataset of approximately  <dig> operons.

around 8% of the s. pneumoniae tigr <dig> genome is repetitive in nature. it includes sequences  that are present at multiple locations in the genome, such as mobile genetic elements, small dispersed repeats like rup and box elements, and other repetitive regions. although these regions were excluded for identifying srna, we detected a high level of transcription in these repetitive regions from both sense and antisense strands. because it is not possible to identify the actual origin of transcription with tiling arrays, future experiments designed to analyze the transcriptional activity in these repeat regions are warranted. in view of recent findings where srnas are involved in repressing expression of toxic proteins  <cit>  and are present in multiple copies, we speculate that that these repetitive regions may be involved in various regulatory activities within the cell.

in conclusion, our combinatorial approach of experimental identification of srnas on a genome scale using tiling arrays in conjunction with computational analyses of srnas in s. pneumoniae tigr <dig> has resulted in the description of  <dig> srnas in this clinically relevant strain. our result forms the initial framework for understanding srna-based regulation of s. pneumoniae gene expression.

CONCLUSIONS
here we have demonstrated the utility of tiling arrays to study whole genome transcription in prokaryotes. the analysis of high-resolution transcription map of the s. pneumoniae clinical isolate tigr <dig> results in identification of  <dig> novel srnas. bioinformatics sequence based searches helped to predict function of  <dig> srnas. comparative genomics shows that half of the identified srna sequences are unique to s. pneumoniae genome. we identified eight overrepresented sequence motifs among srna sequences that correspond to different functional categories. we identified  <dig> operon structures in the genome, further validated by available experimental identifications. overall, this work elucidated pneumococcal operon structures and identified previously undiscovered srnas, which will enhance our understanding of the complexity and extent of the pneumococcal 'expressed' genome. also, this work opens up new avenues for understanding the complex rna regulatory network governing s. pneumoniae physiology and virulence.
