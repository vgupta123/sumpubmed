BACKGROUND
the integument of amniotes has evolved from a basic cornified epidermis for protection against the environment and the retention of water into an elaborate covering with epidermal structures used additionally for sexual display, camouflage, locomotion, and thermoregulation  <cit> . the claws, scales, beaks and feathers of reptiles and birds are formed from the products of two multigene families, alpha  and beta  keratins  <cit> . alpha keratins, a subtype of intermediate filaments found in the epithelia of all vertebrates, have expanded and functionally diversified in amniotes through gene duplication  <cit> . the β-keratins are found exclusively in reptiles and birds and have also expanded and diversified especially in the avian and chelonian lineages  <cit> .

the type i  and type ii  α-keratins form obligatory heterodimers  <cit>  that make up the structural basis of the cornified epidermis and the epidermal appendages in mammals, such as wool, hair, claws, horns and hooves  <cit> . in birds, epidermal α-keratins make up the stratum corneum of the general epidermis and epidermal appendages such as the reticulate scale  <cit> . they are present in varying degrees along with the β-keratins in the avian scutate scales, claws, beaks, spurs, and lingual nails  <cit> . although α-keratins are expressed in the early stages of feather development and in the cells of the rachis  <cit> , the β-keratins make up 90% of the barbs and barbules of the mature feather  <cit> . in other words, the dynamic duplication and diversification of the β-keratin genes are thought to have contributed to the emergence of a novel epidermal appendage, the feather, which characterizes over  <dig>  species of birds  <cit> .

the avian β-keratins were originally grouped into four subfamilies  based on expression profiles and sequence heterogeneity  <cit> . more recently, an avian β-keratin isolated from cultured keratinocytes has been reported  <cit>  and it is phylogenetically distinct from other β-keratin subfamilies  <cit> . this keratinocyte β-keratin is also found in crocodilians, but not in the squamates examined to date  <cit> . an additional β-keratin gene, bkj, which is similar to feather-like β-keratins, has been identified on a unique locus and annotated as β-keratin from jun-transformed cells  <cit> . thus, recent studies have regrouped the β-keratins into four different, but overlapping phylogenetically distinct subfamilies , proposing that the feather-like and bkj genes are basal genes within the feather β-keratin clade  <cit> .

the type i and ii α-keratins are found on two unlinked genomic loci. in mammals, the type i α-keratin locus is separated by a small cluster of keratin associated proteins . however this type i mammalian locus still shows a high level of synteny with the green anole lizard, chicken and zebra finch which lacks the kaps  <cit> . in birds, the type i cluster is found on microchromosome  <dig>  <cit> . the type ii α-keratin cluster has been localized to linkage groups in the chicken and zebra finch genomes where they also show a high level of synteny with mammals and the green anole lizard  <cit> . one type i gene variant is found on the type ii cluster suggesting a common genomic locus of origin for the α-keratins in amniotes  <cit> .

all four β-keratin subfamilies  have been localized to a single locus in both the chicken and zebra finch; microchromosome  <dig>  however, several other unlinked loci contain feather β-keratins  <cit> . furthermore, the β-keratins from the green anole lizard are found on a single locus  <cit>  and nearly half of the western painted turtle β-keratins are found on a single locus that is syntenic to microchromosome  <dig> of the chicken and zebra finch suggesting a common ancestral locus for β-keratins  <cit> .

here we have taken advantage of the sequencing of  <dig> bird genomes  <cit>  spanning the avian phylogeny see companion study,  <cit>  to investigate the evolutionary landscape of α- and β-keratins in the avian clade using copy number, molecular phylogenies, genomic orientation and transcriptome data. our copy number data indicates that both α- and β-keratins have evolved in a dynamic manner with gene number contractions and expansions over the course of avian evolution leading to modern birds. comparative transcriptome analyses demonstrate that  <dig> α-keratins and  <dig> β-keratins are differentially expressed in chicken scales and feathers during embryonic development. all four β-keratin subfamilies are highly expressed in developing scales, whereas the feather and keratinocyte β-keratins are highly expressed in the developing feather. the scales and feathers of birds have played important roles in the diversification of birds and their adaptation to multiple ecological niches. the dynamic evolution of the α- and β-keratins in the avian lineage accompanied these adaptations with the avian specific feather β-keratins making up to 85% of the total number of β-keratins, becoming the major structural component of the avian feather.

RESULTS
genome searches of α-keratins show lineage specific gene losses and gains
we searched the genomes of  <dig> avian species that span the avian phylogeny,  <dig> crocodilians and  <dig> turtles  <cit>  for α-keratins and made use of the α-keratin copy number estimates for the green anole, human, opossum, house mouse and platypus from vandebergh and bossuyt  <cit>  to test the hypothesis that there are no differences in copy number between birds and mammals and non-avian reptiles. we found that the total number of bird α-keratins, 26– <dig> , is different from mammals and non-avian reptiles  with 29– <dig>  α-keratins . furthermore, birds have a lower number of type i α-keratins  than mammals and non-avian reptiles . the number of bird type ii α-keratins  was also lower than that of mammals and non-avian reptiles .

the differences in copy number of type i and ii α-keratins among vertebrate groups suggest a dynamic gain or loss of this gene family. to test this hypothesis, we annotated all of the bird, crocodilian, turtle, human and green anole α-keratins to determine which α-keratin genes may have been lost in the avian lineage . we applied the same nomenclature of α-keratins as the one based on human/mammalian genes  <cit> . we considered a gene to be lost in the avian lineage if it is present in human and at least one reptile and not found in any of the  <dig> bird genomes or avian expressed sequence tag  libraries. concurrently, we also identified the number of genes lost in the crocodilian and turtle lineages. based on our annotations, we classified all avian and reptilian α-keratins into  <dig> type i and  <dig> type ii genes . we found  <dig> type i  and  <dig> type ii  α-keratins missing in birds. interestingly, turtles have a relatively low number of type i and ii α-keratins and appear to have lost krt <dig>  krt <dig>  krt <dig>  krt <dig> and krt <dig> type i genes and krt <dig>  krt6a, krt <dig>  krt <dig>  krt <dig> and krt <dig> type ii genes. crocodilians have also lost four of the same type ii genes, apparently independently  and lost the type i gene krt <dig>  the cochleal or otokeratin type ii α-keratin cdna was sequenced and described for the chicken by heller et al.  <cit>  and appears to have originated early in the reptilian lineage, as all reptiles and birds have at least one cochleal gene while none are found in humans.table  <dig>

while several α-keratin genes are absent in the avian lineage, at least one type i and one type ii variant have expanded. krt <dig>  a type i α-keratin found in epithelia of mammals has a mean copy number of  <dig>  genes in birds and  <dig>  genes in human and non-avian reptiles . krt <dig>  a type ii α-keratin gene associated with a feather rachis anomaly  <cit> , is higher in birds  relative to humans or non-avian reptiles . at least two copies of krt <dig> and krt <dig> were found in all  <dig> birds.

the krt <dig> expansion in birds led us to investigate whether an increase in copy number is related to mutations in krt <dig> genes such as the mutation that causes the chicken frizzle feather phenotype  <cit> . the associated mutation is at the exon 5/intron  <dig> junction that induces a cryptic splice site found within exon  <dig> of krt <dig> resulting in a  <dig> base pair deletion. this cryptic splice site has a similar nucleotide motif  as that of the normal splice site at the exon5/intron <dig> junction. a total of  <dig> α-keratins were annotated as krt <dig> genes for the  <dig> bird genomes, with most species having  <dig> or more variants . of these  <dig>  we found that only  <dig> krt <dig> genes have the gtgaag motif from  <dig> species . unexpectedly, these  <dig> species all had below the mean krt <dig> copy number . these data suggest that the frizzle feather phenotype should be rare among birds. indeed, only chickens, pigeons, geese and canaries have been described as having feather characteristics similar to the frizzle phenotype  <cit> . this is consistent with our finding that the pigeon has the cryptic splice site as well as the two finches, which are in the same family as canaries.

avian adaptations to novel lifestyles was accompanied by β-keratin gene family dynamics
from all  <dig> bird genomes combined, we found  <dig> complete β-keratin genes with both start and stop codons and without unknown sequence  or frame shift mutations. we also found  <dig> incomplete avian β-keratins . this analysis showed extreme variation in copy number for birds with the barn owl having only  <dig> β-keratins and the zebra finch having a maximum of  <dig> complete genes . consistent with earlier studies  <cit> , the american alligator and green sea turtle have  <dig> and  <dig> β-keratins, respectively. while, the barn owl and zebra finch represent the minimum and maximum number of total β-keratins, respectively, we found that the mean number of β-keratins in birds was  <dig> . we identified  <dig> statistical outliers  that have a value greater than or equal to the third quartile plus  <dig>  times the iqr , which are birds with the highest number of β-keratin genes . these drastic copy number differences may relate to the quality of the genome build or to other factors such as domestication, since they belong to  <dig> of  <dig> domesticated species among the  <dig> birds.

annotation of the β-keratins was performed using the greenwold and sawyer  <cit>  dataset. the feather-like β-keratins and β-keratins from jun-transformed cells  have been shown to group with feather β-keratins in previous phylogenetic analyses  <cit> , therefore genes resulting in a best hit to those genes were annotated as feather β-keratins. we found that feather β-keratins comprised up to 85% of the total number of β-keratins for birds. using levene’s test we can reject the null hypothesis of equal variance among claw , scale , keratinocyte  and total number of β-keratins, but not for feather β-keratins and the total number of β-keratins , indicating that the variance of feather β-keratin copy number for birds can be used as an indicator of the variance in the total β-keratin copy number for these  <dig> bird species.

in order to ascertain if β-keratin copy number differences in birds correlate to species phylogenetic relatedness or lifestyle , we calculated the proportion of each of the four β-keratin subfamilies  to the total number of β-keratins for each lifestyle using standard and phylogenetic anova. we found that the proportion of feather β-keratins to the total number of β-keratins is significantly lower for aquatic and semi-aquatic birds  than for land birds , while the proportion of keratinocyte β-keratins is significantly higher for aquatic and semi-aquatic birds than land birds . this includes aquatic and semi-aquatic species that are considered to have been independently derived according to the genome scale phylogeny in our companion study . however, the species phylogeny  indicates that the eagles do not group with the other aquatic birds, we therefore removed them from the aquatic bird list and found that only the higher proportion of keratinocyte β-keratins remained statistically significant  indicating more strongly that the change in β-keratin gene numbers could be associated with an aquatic lifestyle. we next considered birds with a predatory lifestyle  and found that the proportion of claw β-keratins  and keratinocyte β-keratins  is significantly higher in predatory birds than other birds while the proportion of feather β-keratins  is significantly lower for predatory birds. like the aquatic species, this finding occurs for independent lineages of predatory birds. we did not find any significant differences in copy number for the four β-keratin subfamilies between the major stem lineages of birds: paleognathae vs. neognathae or paleognathae and galloanserae vs. neoaves; see also jarvis et al.  <cit> ). together these data indicate that dynamic changes in the proportion of β-keratin subfamilies have occurred as birds have adapted to novel lifestyles.

the α- and β-keratin multigene families have similar patterns of sequence divergence following gene duplication
to further our understanding of the evolution of the α- and β-keratin multigene families in birds we performed phylogenetic analyses and examined their genomic orientation . by examining these two types of data we were able to elucidate the gene duplication history of multigene families and gain a deeper understanding of their genomic origin.figure  <dig>

genomic orientation of β-keratins in birds. this figure is a genomic alignment of β-keratins in birds containing a genomic locus with at least two β-keratin subfamilies. for the chicken and zebra finch this locus is microchromosome  <dig>  although feather β-keratins can be found on many genomic loci other than the one shown here  <cit> , we focused on this locus as it has members from all of the β-keratin clades. the annotations are based on our β-keratin phylogeny . the breaks in the line for each species are indicative of different genomic scaffolds. the direction of the arrow is indicative of the dna strand. the arrows with solid colors are complete genes and those with white centers are incomplete genes. the annotation above the figure is based on each of the four β-keratin subfamilies, while the clades based on the β-keratin phylogeny  are shown below the figure.



the phylogenetic analyses of the type i and ii α-keratins  demonstrate that they can be separated into  <dig> main clades  with clade a being composed of a single basal gene. the remaining two clades  of the type i and type ii α-keratins are composed of multiple phylogenetically significant sub-clades of different gene variants. the α-keratins genes, krt <dig> and  <dig> are distributed among several sub-clades in their respective phylogenies  and the genes in different sub-clades are generally found interposed between other α-keratin genes on their respective α-keratin loci . these phylogenies clearly demonstrate that krt <dig> and krt <dig> genes have expanded and their duplication history is marked by non-tandem duplication and subsequent sequence divergence. our phylogenetic and genomic orientation data further support the idea that type i and ii α-keratins have evolved through gene duplications in a concerted fashion  <cit> .

for the β-keratin phylogeny, the green anole forms a clade and therefore was selected as the outgroup . furthermore, a clade of keratinocyte β-keratins composed of bird, turtle and crocodilian genes forms the basal sister clade . the remaining bird, turtle and crocodilian β-keratins form a second major clade that is composed of another keratinocyte β-keratin clade , two claw β-keratin clades, one scale β-keratin clade and an avian specific feather β-keratin clade. while all of the scale β-keratins annotated in additional file  <dig>  <cit>  group together, only a portion of them form a phylogenetically significant clade with strong bootstrap support. similar to the α-keratin genes, krt <dig> and krt <dig>  the β-keratin subfamilies, keratinocyte and claw β-keratins, have duplicated in a non-tandem pattern  and form multiple phylogenetically significant clades . collectively, these results indicate that the transposition of duplicated genes on the same locus in a non-tandem fashion is adequate to induce a relatively high level of sequence divergence possibly resulting in neofunctionalization.

generally our gene trees  did not follow the genome scale phylogeny of the  <dig> bird species in jarvis et al.  <cit>  . this is not surprising because in that study no single gene tree they analyzed was identical to the species tree. due to incomplete lineage sorting, most genes differed from the species tree by 20% of the branches, and our findings above indicate large scale convergence of keratins among aquatic and predatory birds with relationships different from the species tree. for each gene phylogeny , however, we found that sub-clades of closely related species frequently grouped together such as those of the palaeognathae , galloanseres  and some species of the psittacopasserimorphae .

the phylogenetic analyses of type i and ii α-keratins  support the interpretation that birds have lost  <dig> α-keratin gene variants . we found that the gene variants that are missing in birds form statistically significant clades in human and non-avian reptiles. additionally we found that our phylogenetic analyses resulted in slightly different copy number counts for the α-keratin genes and β-keratin subfamilies from the annotations detailed above . however, the statistical significance of the comparisons between the β-keratin subfamilies and lifestyles largely remained valid with the phylogeny data . the exception is with the keratinocyte β-keratin comparison between aquatic and land birds  when the eagles are grouped with land birds.

previous studies  <cit>  have shown that one type i α-keratin gene  is found on the type ii α-keratin locus for fish, amphibians, mammals and the green anole lizard indicating that the α-keratins evolved from a single locus. while vandebergh and bossuyt  <cit>  found a type i α-keratin on chromosome unknown of the chicken, they found no direct evidence that type i and ii α-keratins are linked in birds. in fact the gene they found on chicken chromosome unknown was not found during our genome searches. however, we did find that  <dig> of the bird species , the  <dig> crocodilian species and the western painted turtle had one type i α-keratin on a type ii locus . furthermore, these genes were annotated as krt <dig>  the green sea turtle and green anole lizard both have  <dig> krt <dig> genes, which are found on  <dig> different loci.

differential expression of the α- and β-keratin genes in chicken epidermal tissue during embryogenesis
we performed transcriptome analyses of scale, dorsal feather and wing feather tissues during chicken development using a customized version of the chicken 44 k agilent microarray  <cit> . we customized the microarray chip by adding all  <dig> α-keratins and  <dig> of the  <dig> chicken β-keratins. the number of unique 60-mer oligonucleotides of β-keratins was constrained due to the highly repetitive nature of feather β-keratins and thus we were only able to produce unique oligonucleotides for  <dig> of the  <dig> chicken feather β-keratins.

tissue samples from the chicken scutate scale, dorsal feather and wing feather were from embryonic day  <dig> and  <dig> and scutate scale and dorsal feather at day  <dig>  although feather morphogenesis begins as early as day  <dig>  to  <dig>  the cellular differentiation of barbs and barbules and the accumulation of β-keratin does not begin until ~ day  <dig> of embryogenesis  <cit> . scutate scale morphogenesis does not begin until day  <dig>  of embryogenesis, and β-keratin accumulation is not detected until 15– <dig> days of development  <cit> . thus, we selected day  <dig> for the initial sampling of the scale and feather tissues  <cit> .

comparison of day  <dig> scutate scale and day  <dig> dorsal feather tissues showed that  <dig> α-keratins and  <dig> β-keratins were differentially expressed, but the fold change values were  <dig> or below . comparisons of day  <dig> and day  <dig> had the largest number of differentially expressed α- and β-keratins. in comparing day  <dig> dorsal feather to day  <dig> dorsal feather we found  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated α-keratins in the day  <dig> dorsal feather. also  <dig> β-keratins were up-regulated in day  <dig> dorsal feather, which showed up to an  <dig>  fold change for a keratinocyte β-keratin and a  <dig>  fold change for a feather β-keratin. we found  <dig> α-keratins that were up-regulated and  <dig> α-keratins that were down-regulated in day  <dig> scutate scale while  <dig> β-keratins were up-regulated in day  <dig> scale . day  <dig> and  <dig> comparisons of the dorsal feather and scutate scale had slightly lower numbers of α- and β-keratin indicating that day  <dig> of development may be the peak level of keratin expression.table  <dig>

although the scale β-keratins were annotated based upon their expression in scale tissue  <cit> , it appears that the claw β-keratins are expressed at the highest level in scale tissue. in the scutate scale comparisons of day  <dig> vs.  <dig> and day  <dig> vs.  <dig>   <dig> out of the  <dig> highest fold changes  in day  <dig> and  <dig> scutate scale are claw β-keratins. additionally, the day  <dig> and  <dig> scutate scale inter-tissue comparisons  showed that  <dig> of the highest fold changes  in the scutate scale are claw β-keratins indicating that claw β-keratins have an important role in the composition of epidermal appendages, such as scales, in addition to the claw and beak  <cit> .

four sample comparisons had genes from the feather β-keratin subfamily that were up and down regulated . the day  <dig> comparison of the scutate scale and dorsal feather indicates that a single feather β-keratin from microchromosome  <dig> is up-regulated in the day  <dig> dorsal feather while all of the down-regulated feather β-keratins are on different loci . furthermore, feather β-keratins on microchromosome  <dig> are up-regulated in day  <dig> scutate scale in comparisons of the scutate scale day  <dig> and dorsal and wing feather day  <dig>  additionally, comparisons between the scutate scale and wing feather during day  <dig> of embryogenesis show an up-regulation of microchromosome  <dig> feather β-keratins and down-regulation of feather β-keratins on other loci in the day  <dig> scutate scale tissue. these data indicate that feather β-keratins on microchromosome  <dig> are regulated differently from feather β-keratins on other loci .

we found that the basal bkj genes of the feather β-keratin clade  are expressed at a higher level in the dorsal and wing feather when compared to the scutate scale at day  <dig> and  <dig> . although bkj genes are expressed in higher levels in the feather, they are also expressed in the scutate scales as evidenced by the down-regulation in the scutate scale comparisons between day  <dig> and day  <dig> and  <dig>  the feather-like β-keratins are found in multiple comparisons indicating they are expressed in both feather and scutate scale tissue. interestingly, the only three feather β-keratins expressed in dorsal and wing feather comparisons at day  <dig> are the feather-like β-keratins suggesting that they have an important role in feather morphology. while the feather-like β-keratins are linked to other feather β-keratin genes on chromosome  <dig>  the bkj genes are found on chromosome  <dig> and are not linked to any other β-keratins indicating that intra and inter-locus differential expression occurs among the feather β-keratin clade.

feather β-keratins in the chicken genome are found on multiple loci   <cit> . based on our sample comparisons in this study we were able to determine which feather β-keratins from which chicken genomic loci  were being expressed in the dorsal and wing feathers during embryonic development. the genomic loci of feather β-keratins being expressed in day  <dig> dorsal  feathers and day  <dig> wing feathers are summarized in figure  <dig>  the feather β-keratins expressed in the day  <dig> down feathers are located on galga  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  in addition, the feather-like genes on galga  <dig> were expressed as was feather β-keratin on galga unknown. the feather β-keratins expressed in the day  <dig> wing feathers are located on galga  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  in addition, the feather-like genes on galga  <dig> were expressed as was feather β-keratin on galga unknown .figure  <dig> 
expression of feather β-keratins during embryonic feather development. this figure summarizes the present data on the expression of feather β-keratin by chromosomal location in embryonic  feathers using data from the present study. for each feather type , the chicken  chromosome number of the feather β-keratins expressed is listed. the feathers of day  <dig> dorsal skin express feather β-keratins located on galga chromosome  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and chromosome unknown. wing feathers, at day  <dig>  express feather β-keratins from galga chromosome  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and chromosome unknown.



the only comparison showing both up and down-regulated scale β-keratins is the day  <dig> scutate scale versus wing feather, which indicates that scale genes annotated as  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are up-regulated while scale  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are down-regulated. these scale β-keratins are all found on the same locus  and their number describes their orientation in a 5′ to 3′ direction. alternatively, only one keratinocyte β-keratin  is consistently differentially expressed from the other keratinocyte β-keratins on galga  <dig>  these results indicate that while β-keratins from all subfamilies are being expressed in these tissues, intra-locus differential expression of galga  <dig> β-keratins and inter-locus differential expression of feather β-keratins may contribute to the structural complexity of these and other avian epidermal appendages.

discussion
this study made use of the newly published genomes of  <dig> birds in addition to the  <dig> previously published bird genomes  to investigate the multigene families of α- and β-keratins  <cit> . incomplete or low coverage genomes can lead to an underestimate of gene family copy numbers. for α-keratins, little variation is seen among our copy number estimates . furthermore, based on the α-keratin annotation, we find consistent copy number estimates of the different type i and ii α-keratins . in contrast to the α-keratins, the β-keratins have a much larger variation in copy number estimates . while both of these gene families are tandemly arrayed on at least  <dig> genomic loci strong differences exist in the variation of the copy number estimates among the  <dig> birds. the newly sequenced bird genomes are separated into two coverage groups; low  and high   <cit> . the coverage in these two groups vary, but if the β-keratin copy number is related to genome coverage the copy number of β-keratins should correlate with fold coverage and contig and scaffold n <dig>  however, for each fold coverage group  we do not find a statistically significant correlation between β-keratin copy number and fold coverage, contig n <dig> or scaffold n <dig>  while, we do not discount the likelihood that some of the bird species in this study have unsequenced β-keratins, we believe that the relative variation in β-keratin copy number among birds is appropriately represented in this study.

alpha -keratins
the α-keratin nomenclature used in this study is based upon mammals and more specifically humans  <cit> . while mammals have shown the largest expansion of α-keratins among amniotes  <cit> , we find that there is avian specific gene loss and gain of α-keratins. the expansion of specific α-keratin gene variants  in birds may not be the result of gene duplication of a single “parent” gene, but instead the duplication of several different gene variants resulting in novel α-keratins of avian origin. if some of these genes are novel α-keratins as the phylogeny and genomic alignment data indicate, then the current α-keratin nomenclature, based on mammalian genes, does not adequately account for the diversity found in birds. therefore, we suggest that the krt <dig> genes be annotated as krt42a and b and the krt <dig> genes be annotated as krt75a-e to reflect their phylogenetic relationship and genomic orientation.

our discovery of the krt <dig> and krt <dig> expansion in the avian lineage and ng et al.  <cit>  discovery that krt <dig> is important in feather rachis development indicates that the duplication of krt <dig> and krt <dig> α-keratins may be the result of concerted evolution and that together they form the α-keratin heterodimer in feathers. furthermore, it is likely that these duplicated genes contributed to the evolution of feathers as did the feather β-keratins  <cit> .

beta -keratins
the fact that the extreme statistical outliers from the average number of ~ <dig> β-keratins across bird species are all species that have undergone various degrees of domestication , indicate that there could be an association between these observations. in support of this relationship, both the peking duck  and turkey , the remaining domesticated species among the birds, have an above average number of β-keratins. given that domestication may increase recombination rate  <cit> , the extreme variation in β-keratin copy numbers among birds may be partially linked to higher recombination rates on β-keratin loci and the domestication of these species. the differential expression of feather β-keratins is related to their genomic locus  <cit> , signifying that expansion of feather β-keratins, through unequal crossing over events on specific loci, may be induced by artificial selection.

expression of feather β-keratins and the evolution of feathers
numerous studies have examined the biochemical and molecular make up of embryonic and adult feathers, as well as their component parts  <cit> . for example kemp  <cit>  suggested that there were 25– <dig> different feather keratin mrna molecules in the embryonic feather and a total of 100– <dig> keratin genes in the chicken genome. the present study supports the view that a high number of α- and β-keratins are expressed during the embryonic development of scutate scales and feathers in the chicken . these results are further supported by a recent study by ng et al.  <cit> , which found that 90% of α-keratin and over 95% of β-keratin genes in the chicken are differentially expressed during post-hatching feather genesis. however, the number of β-keratins that can be extracted from the cornified tissues of scales and feathers and detected on 2-dimensional gels is considerably smaller  <cit> , suggesting that messenger rnas are being inactivated, perhaps by micrornas  <cit> .

recently, kowata et al.  <cit>  found that the feather β-keratin on chromosome  <dig> of the chicken  is expressed in the cells that form the barbules of pennaceous feathers but is not expressed in the barbules of plumulaceous feathers. in the present study, we did not find any differential expression of the galga  <dig> feather β-keratin in embryonic feathers supporting the results of kowata et al.  <cit> . however, we did find that galga  <dig> feather β-keratins are differentially expressed in comparison to feather β-keratins on other loci and that galga  <dig> feather β-keratins are generally up-regulated in scale tissue. previous studies have demonstrated that the ancestral locus of β-keratins is homologous to galga  <dig> of the chicken  <cit> , suggesting that feather β-keratins diversified to other genomic loci through duplication and translocation. recently, ng et al.  <cit>  examined which genomic loci  are utilized for the expression of feather β-keratins in post-hatched contour and flight feathers. while it is clear that feather β-keratin located on galga  <dig> is only expressed in the barbules and possibly the hooklets of pennaceous feathers, feather β-keratins from multiple loci are expressed in the ramus, rachis, and calamus of post-hatched feathers. overall these data suggest that as the avian epidermis evolved to produce novel structures  it took advantage of the diversity of feather β-keratins that evolved on different loci.

evolution of birds into novel ecological niches
bird diversification is marked by evolution into novel habitats and ways of life such as predatory and aquatic lifestyles. birds of prey are identified by their powerful beaks and claws. in the case of the claw, studies indicate that the morphology of the claw of birds of prey  differs from non-raptorial birds and between different orders of birds of prey  <cit>  . in addition to being expressed in the claw  <cit> , claw β-keratins are also expressed in the beak of the chicken  <cit> . in this study we found that the birds of prey have a significantly higher proportion of claw β-keratins than non-raptorial birds, which may indicate that they have played an important role in the evolution of these unique epidermal appendages.

the feathers of aquatic birds have been shown to have a higher hydrophobicity than the feathers of terrestrial birds  <cit> . this may be important for thermal regulation especially for birds in adverse climates, such as penguins. our analysis of β-keratin copy number variation among birds has shown that the proportion of keratinocyte β-keratins is higher and the proportion of feather β-keratins is lower for aquatic birds compared to terrestrial birds. also, we found that at least  <dig> of the  <dig> chicken β-keratin genes are transcribed during the formation of feathers in the chicken. while feather β-keratins are annotated based upon the tissue in which their amino acid sequence was first determined  <cit> , it has been shown that there are actually multiple β-keratin gene variants  expressed during embryonic development of feathers  <cit> . collectively, this indicates that the proportion of gene variants is important as birds have adapted to their lifestyles  and that their feather, claw and beak structure may have been modified by the dynamic expansion and contraction of specific β-keratin gene variants.

CONCLUSIONS
the number of α-keratin genes is reduced in the avian lineage, and while still important for feather development, for example during rachis morphogenesis  <cit> , their low abundance in the barbs and barbules of feathers demonstrates that they have a reduced role in establishing the composition of mature feathers. on the other hand, the β-keratin multigene family has undergone dramatic expansions in the bird and turtle lineages resulting in novel epidermal appendages  <cit> . members of all β-keratin subfamilies are expressed during the development of scutate scales and feathers with feather β-keratins becoming specialized in their expression profiles in the diverse assortment of feathers found in present day birds  <cit>  . the early evolution of β-keratins in the archosaurian lineage is marked by lineage specific expansions, but differences in the proportion of claw, feather, and keratinocyte β-keratin genes in modern birds may be attributed to their ecological niche . our overall findings suggest that the number of β-keratins and the relative proportion of β-keratins in each subfamily influenced the composition of avian skin appendages and therefore their structural properties. clearly, the evolution of feathers in the lineage leading to modern birds has been shaped by the dynamic evolution of α- and β-keratins.figure  <dig> 
dynamic evolution of β-keratins in the archosaur lineage. this figure illustrates a proposed scenario of β-keratin evolution on the ancestral locus in archosaurs. the bottom row is the proposed locus of β-keratins in the ancestor of turtles, crocodilians and birds. the second row from the bottom indicates that the scale β-keratins have emerged since the divergence of turtles from crocodilians and birds. the origin of the feather β-keratins occurs after the divergence of crocodilians and birds. the order of the β-keratins subfamilies is based on our genomic data from the  <dig> birds and green sea turtle. the top row illustrates the dynamic changes of the proportions of β-keratin subfamilies in modern birds with aquatic and predatory lifestyles. both aquatic and predatory birds have a larger proportion of keratinocyte β-keratins and smaller proportion of feather β-keratins in their genomes. additionally, predatory birds have a larger proportion of claw β-keratins. the divergence times are in millions of years ago . the divergence estimates of the turtle – crocodilian/bird split and the crocodilian – bird split are from shedlock and edwards  <cit> . the divergence time estimates for birds is from jarvis et al.  <cit>  and is the range starting with the divergence of the palaeognathae and neognathae  and the subsequent divergences of most ordinal groups by ~ <dig> mya. jon fjeldså produced the images of the birds .
