BACKGROUND
passerines  are one of the most-widely studied taxonomic groups in evolutionary and ecological research  <cit> . they are frequently studied in the wild because they are easy to observe, often breed in nest-boxes or natural cavities, and have short-generation times and large broods. quantitative genetic studies of passerines have advanced our understanding of natural selection  <cit> , sexual selection  <cit> , the effects of inbreeding  <cit> , speciation  <cit> , the causes of evolutionary stasis  <cit> , and the heritability of fitness traits  <cit> . for the latter two areas enormous progress has been made in recent years by quantitative genetic analyses of pedigreed populations  <cit> .

while quantitative genetic studies of passerines have set the benchmark in terms of understanding the genetic architecture of fitness-related traits in wild vertebrates, they do suffer from one obvious limitation: they cannot pinpoint the actual loci responsible for adaptive evolution. indeed, molecular genetic studies of passerines have been somewhat hampered by a lack of genomic resources. in contrast, gene mapping studies of other ecologically relevant vertebrates are becoming increasingly commonplace  <cit> . at present it is not possible to conduct genome-wide mapping or population genomic studies in any passerine species, largely due to insufficient numbers of characterised polymorphic markers such as microsatellites. in fact, only one passerine species, the great reed warbler , has a genetic linkage map  <cit> , and even then markers cover only ~30% of the genome.

fortunately, this situation is beginning to be addressed. there are currently ~ <dig> passerine microsatellite markers deposited in genbank, although the majority are only informative in the species in which they were originally isolated, or closely related species  <cit> . the recently assembled draft genome of the red junglefowl gallus gallus  <cit> , the progenitor of the domestic chicken, will also facilitate further molecular studies in passerines. despite a divergence date of ~ <dig> million years ago, galliformes  and passeriformes show highly conserved karyotypes  <cit> , which means the chicken genome assembly is a useful comparative resource for molecular studies of passerines. for example, the map location of ~ <dig> passerine microsatellites was recently predicted by using blast to identify regions of high sequence similarity between passerine microsatellite flanking regions and the chicken genome assembly <cit> . regions of high homology may prove useful in designing primers to amplify a locus in as diverse an array of passerine species as possible. however, this approach has yet to be successfully attempted on a large scale and it is unclear to what extent the repeat motif is conserved across divergent families.

the prospects for molecular evolution, gene mapping, comparative genomics and population genomic studies in passerines are greatly improved by ongoing efforts to sequence the zebra finch  genome  <cit> . genomics resources for the zebra finch include > <dig>  expressed sequence tags , mostly generated as part of the songbird neurogenomics initiative  <cit> . the aim of this paper is to demonstrate that microsatellite loci within zebra finch ests are a useful resource for population and comparative genomics studies in the zebra finch and in other passerine species.

in recent years it has become apparent that sequence databases can be used as a tool to rapidly identify microsatellite loci, thereby avoding time-consuming library screening. it is now known that microsatellites are present within most eukaryote genomes, principally in intergenic regions, but also within introns and exons  <cit> . in silico detection  <cit>  and validation  <cit>  of exonic microsatellites from est databases  has been achieved in economically important plants, and to a lesser extent in vertebrates  <cit> . in cereals it is estimated that 4–6% of genes contain est-ssrs of at least  <dig> bp length  <cit> . there is some evidence that est-ssrs lack variation compared to those in introns or intergenic regions  <cit> , but even the lowest estimates suggest that at least 25% of est-ssrs are polymorphic. est-ssrs offer two advantages over intergenic microsatellites. first, because they are exonic, their flanking regions will often be functionally-constrained. therefore, it is likely that pcr primers for est-ssrs can be used to genotype loci in related species to the source species. second, because they are exonic, they are more likely than intergenic microsatellites to be in strong linkage disequilibrium with functionally important sites. this makes them well suited to population genomics or gene mapping applications that hope to map genes of economic or adaptive significance.

in this paper we describe an analysis of zebra finch est accessions deposited in genbank. our objectives were to:  identify and describe est-ssrs in the zebra finch.  establish whether these loci are likely to be polymorphic within the zebra finch, and a distantly related passerine, the house sparrow .  predict the map location on the gallus gallus genome of the homologue of each est-ssr. because the passerine and gallus genomes show a high degree of synteny  <cit> , such an analysis will help predict the location of each est-ssr in the zebra finch genome.  predict whether each est-ssr is within the coding region, the 5' untranslated region or the 3' untranslated region of the exon in which it resides. this information will be useful in predicting which loci are most likely to be polymorphic. coding region microsatellites are likely to be under the strongest functional constraint, and therefore be the least variable. this represents the first study of its kind in passerines, a diverse and scientifically important taxon, that is widely studied in evolutionary biology and ecological research.

RESULTS
summary of identified est-ssrs
a total of  <dig>  zebra finch ests were analysed.  <dig>  were unique  and the remainder were components of a total of  <dig>  contigs. thus, we estimate that  <dig>  unique sequences were present in the database. note that the chicken genome database lists ~ <dig>  unigenes. this suggests that around 55% of genes or expressed pseudogenes are represented in the zebra finch est dataset.

 <dig>  repeats were identified, from a total of  <dig> different ests . after checking for redundancy, the est-ssrs were attributed to  <dig> singleton ests and  <dig> est-contigs; i.e.  <dig> unique sequences contained a repeat that was at least  <dig> bp long . one hundred and forty-four of the repeats were at least  <dig> bp long. therefore, we estimate that  <dig> %  of loci contain a microsatellite of length ≥ <dig> bp and  <dig> % of loci contain a microsatellite of at least  <dig> bp length. these estimates are conservative, as most ests or assembled contigs are not full gene transcripts. di- and tri-nucleotides were more prevalent than tetra or penta-nucleotides. the most common microsatellite motif was the dinucleotide at;  <dig> different at repeats of length ≥ <dig> bp and purity ≥90% were identified. summaries of each repeat and motif type are provided in table  <dig> and table  <dig>  detailed descriptions of each est-ssr are provided in the additional file  <dig> 

in silico mapping of est-ssrs
of the  <dig> est-ssr loci, in total  <dig>  were assigned a predicted map position with an e value of 1e- <dig> or better. orthologues of zebra finch est-ssr loci were assigned to all assembled chicken chromosomes , except the microchromosomes gga <dig> and ggae <dig>  among mapped est-ssrs  <dig> were dinucleotides,  <dig> were trinucleotides,  <dig> were tetranucleotides and  <dig> were pentanucleotides. assignment success rates did not vary between the different repeat types. the mean sequence similarity between a zebra finch est and its matching chicken orthologue was  <dig> %.

in silico mapped est-ssrs were approximately evenly distributed across the chicken genome. a general linear model was fitted to formally examine marker distribution, where the response varaible was the number of markers per chromosome and the predictors were chromosome length and chromosome category . chromosome length was a good predictor of the number of est-ssrs that were mapped to each chromosome  and explained ~92% of the variance. however, it was also evident that the density of est-ssr loci was greater on microchromosomes than macrochromosomes; chromosome cateogry explained an additional  <dig> % of the variance , although marker density was also relatively high on the largest chromosome, gga <dig> .

exonic location of est-ssrs
two hundred and eighteen est-ssr loci showed significant homology to known or predicted genes in the ensembl chicken peptide database . seventeen were dinucleotides,  <dig> were trinucleotides,  <dig> were tetranucleotides and  <dig> were pentanucleotides. it was relatively unusual for the repeat motif to reside within the coding region of an exon , although frequencies ranged from 0%  to 30% . only four of the coding region est-ssrs were not trinucleotides.

comparison with existing passerine microsatellites
six est-ssr loci showed high sequence similarity to sequence flanking published passerine microsatellites ; i.e. they were homologues of previously known loci. all other est-ssrs were not previously described.

polymorphism of est-ssrs – in silico analysis of contigs
all of the est contigs containing di, tri- and penta- nucleotide loci that had been sequenced three or more times were examined for repeat length polymorphism . eleven of the twenty five dinucleotides were polymorphic, as were 10/ <dig> trinucleotides and 6/ <dig> pentanucleotides, giving a total of 27/ <dig>  polymorphic markers. when the analysis was restricted to contigs with four or more overlapping sequences, the proportion of polymorphic loci was greater . the loci included in these analysis are unbiased with respect to repeat length or purity.

polymorphism of est-ssrs – laboratory data
eight of the ten  primer pairs produced a polymorphic product in both populations of zebra finch . the number of alleles per locus ranged from 2– <dig>  and the observed heterozygosity ranged from  <dig> – <dig> . genetic diversity was broadly similar in the two populations. not surprisingly, the est-ssr primers had lower amplification success in house sparrow populations, although 7/ <dig> and 6/ <dig> amplified products of the expected size in the lundy and aldra populations, respectively. all seven loci in the lundy population were polymorphic  and four of the loci were polymorphic in the aldra birds . all markers were in hardy-weinberg equilibrium . one est-ssr  was predicted to map to the z chromosome; in support of this prediction all genotyped females  had just one allele. when only male genotypes were considered, the marker was in hwe.

linkage mapping of est-ssrs
twopoint linkage analysis conducted on the sheffield population of zebra finches produced highly significant lod scores between three of the four est-ssrs that were in silico predicted to be linked. pairwise lod scores and kosambi map distances were as follows: dv <dig> and dv <dig> ; dv <dig> and dv <dig> ; dv <dig> and dv <dig> . the fourth locus, ck <dig>  provided weaker, but nonetheless some, evidence of linkage . the marker order predicted from the chicken genome sequence was ck304956-dv952125-dv952809-dv <dig>  which was also the marker order that produced the highest likelihood in the mapping population.

discussion
properties of zebra finch est-ssrs
ssrs appear to be relatively abundant within zebra finch ests.  <dig> % of unique sequences contain an ssr greater than  <dig> bp long and almost 1% of unique sequences contain an ssr greater than  <dig> bp long. these values are comparable to studies of other species, most of which have been conducted in cereals or other plants  <cit> . these are likely to be conservative estimates of the number of ssrs per gene as many ests or assembled contigs do not span the entire length of the gene transcript. estimates of the proportion of ests that contain est-ssrs are generally not available for other vertebrates. however, our unpublished data indicate that approximately  <dig> % of chicken unigenes contain est-ssrs while in mammals the proportion ranges from ~ <dig> % in sheep to ~ <dig> % in mouse. note that inter-genic microsatellites are thought to be much rarer in avian genomes than mammalian genomes  <cit>  but there is little indication that a similar pattern holds for est-ssrs.

among est-ssrs of ≥ <dig> bp length, trinucleotides were the most abundant type of repeat motif, followed by dinucleotides. among est-ssrs ≥ <dig> bp, the two repeat types were equally abundant . the proportion of dinucleotides appears to be similar in the zebra finch as in other species for which comparable data are available, e.g.  <cit> . the observation that dinucleotides are relatively more frequent among long est-ssrs is also consistent with previous studies  <cit> .

the most common motif among est-ssrs ≥ <dig> bp or ≥ <dig> bp was the dinucleotide at. similar observations have been made in rice  <cit>  and several species of pine  <cit> , but this pattern is by no means consistent across species  <cit> . the relative frequency of different trinucleotide motifs was dependent on ssr length. among ssrs ≥ <dig> bp agg was the most common , but among the ssrs ≥ <dig> bp aat was the most common . in other species there is no clear consensus to which trinucleotides are most frequent  <cit> .

approximately 1/ <dig> of est-ssr loci could be assigned to known genes in the ensembl chicken peptide database. it was possible to predict the within-gene location of these est-ssrs, which revealed clear differences between the repeat types. trinucleotides were more often located in coding sequence  of genes  than other repeat types . this observation is expected as a loss or gain of repeat unit in a trinucleotide will not result in a frameshift mutation. cds trinucleotide repeats are of particular interest, as in other organisms a number of pathologies and behaviours are associated with triple repeat expansions  <cit> . there were two tetranucleotides and two pentanucleotides that were identified within the cds of genes. however, all four loci were relatively short  and two of them were interrupted. therefore, these loci may have relatively low mutation rates, minimising the probability of frameshifts arising. among non-cds est-ssrs trinucleotides and pentanucleotides were more likely to be in the 5' utr than the 3'utr, while the opposite was true for dinucleotides. a similar pattern is observed in pine species  <cit> , although there are relatively fewer est-ssrs in the cds of zebra finch, regardless of repeat type. in practical terms this is useful as non-cds ssrs are the most likely to be polymorphic .

chromosomal location of two-thirds of est-ssr loci was predicted by in silico mapping to the chicken genome. it should be noted that these predicted chromosomal locations can only be confirmed when the zebra finch genome sequence is assembled or a linkage map constructed. given that synteny is highly conserved between the chicken and passerine genomes  <cit>  it is likely that loci assigned to a particular chicken chromosome will prove to be linked in the zebra finch. therefore, est-ssrs appear to be dispersed approximately evenly across the zebra finch genome, although they are probably at a marginally higher density on microchromosomes than macrochromosomes. this observation is consistent with the reports that gene density in chickens is greatest on the microchromosomes  <cit> . once these est-ssrs are assigned a map position in the zebra finch  they will provide insight into the extent of chromosomal rearrangements between different avian lineages. note that the four linked loci that we mapped appeared to be in the same order as their linked homologs on chicken chromosome  <dig> 

applications of est-ssrs
the ssrs identified in this study represent a useful resource for evolutionary genetic studies of birds. most obviously, they can be used to build a zebra finch linkage map, possibly acting as framework loci, used in tandem with snps typed at a higher density. we have demonstrated that linkage map construction should be relatively straightforward, and will provide a useful complement to ongoing efforts to construct a physical map. evolutionary quantitative genetic studies of zebra finches have estimated the heritability of traits such as stress response  <cit> , sperm morphology  <cit> , body condition  <cit> , bill colour  <cit>  and digit ratio  <cit> . the availability of a linkage map would facilitate the next stage of genetic studies  of an important model organism in evolutionary and ecological research. a linkage map would also represent a useful tool to aid assembly of the zebra finch genome once shotgun sequencing is complete, because it can help identify which contigs reside on particular chromosomes. assembly of the chicken genome sequence was partially reliant on the consensus chicken linkage map  <cit> .

use of the est-ssrs described here need not be restricted to studies of the source species. previous studies have estimated that less than 10% of passerine microsatellites are polymorphic in species from different taxonomic families  <cit> . therefore, although > <dig> microsatellites have been isolated in passerines, they were derived from ~ <dig> different species, and the majority are not informative in any one species. the location of these microsatellites relative to genes was unknown, although the majority were probably intergenic. there are several reasons to suspect that est-ssrs will be much more widely applicable across species than intergenic microsatellites.

first, because est-ssrs are located within exons they are likely to be under greater functional constraint than intergenic microsatellites. therefore, sequence that flanks the repeat motif of an est-ssr is expected to diverge at a slower rate than is commonly observed with intergenic markers. this expectation is demonstrable with our data. using the blastn default settings 68% of est-ssrs showed significant  homology to the chicken genome, with an average sequence similarity of  <dig> %. this figure compares favourably with a study of passerine intergenic microsatellites  <cit> , where just  <dig> % of markers showed sequence similarity to chicken at e < 1e- <dig> under the same settings.

secondly, an encouraging proportion of the limited number of zebra finch est-ssrs that we tested were polymorphic in another passerine species, the house sparrow. estimating divergence times between passerine species is not straightforward, but zebra finches and house sparrows probably diverged between  <dig> mya  <cit>  and 45mya  <cit>  and are in completely different families . therefore, polymorphic zebra finch est-ssrs appear to be conserved across passerine families.

a third piece of support for the widespread applicability of zebra finch est-ssrs is provided by the small proportion  of loci identified in this study that have also been isolated in other passerines. two of these markers ase <dig>  and mslp <dig>  have been examined with respect to cross-species amplification success rate  <cit> . both loci are polymorphic in species of different sub-families to the source species, and in fact no other markers cloned in these species have greater cross-species amplification success.

although, there is substantial evidence that the zebra finch est-ssrs are conserved across other passerine species, there use in many population genetic studies will be limited unless they are polymorphic . data presented here and elsewhere indicate that a reasonably large proportion of est-ssrs will be polymorphic in other passerines. among loci that produced a pcr product 8/ <dig>  were polymorphic in the source species  and 6/ <dig>  were polymorphic in a distantly related passerine, the house sparrow.

in silico analysis of contigs with three or more overlapping sequences indicated that greater than 40% of loci were polymorphic within the zebra finch. this figure is likely to be an underestimate of the proportion of polymorphic markers for two reasons. first, the majority of loci were represented by only  <dig> or  <dig> sequences, which means polymorphism will be undetected at some variable loci. this point is illustrated by the fact that an analysis restricted to loci represented by four or more sequences, resulted in a higher estimate of 51%, while a similar analysis of uninterrupted repeats yielded an estimate of 60% . second, because many of the ests come from the same libraries, it is inevitable that some contigs will include multiple sequences from the same individual and will not be independent – thereby making it impossible to detect polymorphism. more generally, there is already good support that ests-ssrs are often polymorphic within both the source species and other species  <cit> .

there are several strategies that could be employed to ensure that future laboratory efforts focus on zebra finch est-ssrs that are variable in the source species and in other species.

the first way in which polymorphic est-ssrs could be identified is to concentrate laboratory efforts on dinucleotide repeats. previous studies have shown dinucleotides to be more polymorphic than longer repeat types  <cit> , although an analysis of passerine intergenic microsatellites did not support this observation  <cit> . secondly, it is likely that est-ssrs within non-coding regions are more variable than those found in coding regions, as they are less likely to be under functional constraint. this prediction does have empirical support from studies of rice  <cit>  and bread wheat  <cit> . note that among est-ssrs identified in this study, dinucleotides were the least likely to be in the coding region, which again supports the maximisation of laboratory efforts on dinucleotides. a third way to enhance the proportion of est-ssrs that are polymorphic is to focus efforts towards the longest and purest repeats. among passerine intergenic microsatellites there is a significant positive relationship between repeat length and the probability of being polymorphic  <cit> . similarly, there is a positive relationship between repeat length and heterozygosity in a variety of taxa, including birds  <cit> . this pattern seems to hold for est-ssrs  <cit> . there is also empirical support for the idea that uninterrupted  repeats are more variable than those with interruptions  <cit> . finally, polymorphism can be detected in silico within overlapping est-ssr sequences. in summary, the  <dig> dinucleotide est-ssrs that are ≥ <dig> bp long, and the putatively polymorphic loci reported in additional file  <dig> are probably the most likely to be variable in zebra finches and other passerine species.

CONCLUSIONS
an analysis of zebra finch ests identified greater than six hundred previously undescribed microsatellites . in silico mapping of these est-ssrs to the assembled chicken genome sequence indicated that their homologues are approximately evenly dispersed throughout the chicken genome. given that galliformes and passeriformes share a highly conserved karyotype, these est-ssrs are expected to also be evenly spread throughout the genomes of the zebra finch and other passerines. the majority of these microsatellites are not found within exonic coding regions, suggesting that they need not be functionally constrained, and therefore may be polymorphic. this prediction appears to be confirmed from a screen of a subset of markers in both the source species  and a distantly related species , as well as in silico detection of repeat length polymorphism. we have also demonstrated that these est-ssrs can be used to construct a linkage map of the zebra finch, by genotyping three generations of a pedigreed captive population. further marker development from these est-ssrs will complement ongoing evolutionary genetics research in birds, including comparative genomics, gene mapping and population genomic studies of both captive and wild populations.
