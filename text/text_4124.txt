BACKGROUND
antimicrobial peptides  are components of the innate immune system in animals and plants, and play an important role in antagonistic relationships between microorganisms . there is a great expectation in biotechnological applications of amps that include their use as therapeutic agents, biopreservatives in cosmetics, materials and food; and substitutes of antibiotics in animal feed and in crop protection. amps are of particular interest in the field of crop protection because they meet the regulatory requirements for low environmental impact of pesticides  <cit> . however, the exploitation of natural amps presents limitations, as they are produced in low amounts in the living organisms and their extraction and purification requires complex and costly procedures. in addition, natural amps might show toxicity against non-target organisms  <cit> .

the rational design of amps may overcome these limitations by developing peptides with improved biological properties, like increased antimicrobial activity and stability, and reduced toxicity against non-targeted organisms . in this context, a library of synthetic linear undecapeptides consisting of cecropin a -melittin  hybrids , was previously obtained by combinatorial chemistry  <cit> . several peptides from this library showed potent antibacterial and/or antifungal activities with low cytotoxicity  and moderate susceptibility to proteolytic degradation  <cit> . among them, the bp <dig> peptide exhibited strong activity against phytopathogenic bacteria and was effective in controlling infections by different phytopathogens in apple, pear, tomato and pepper  <cit> . another set of cecmel <dig> peptides  showed fungicidal activity and were effective in the control of postharvest rot of fruits  <cit>  and brown spot of pear trees  <cit> . some of the cecmel <dig> peptides  had cell penetrating properties in eukaryotic cells and have already been used to deliver conjugated “cargo” compounds intracellularly  <cit> . thus, cecmel <dig> peptides represent useful tools in different fields of application. however, their exploitation requires the development of sustainable and feasible means of production.

production of amps in living systems used as biofactories appears to be a promising alternative to the chemical synthesis  <cit> . several prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems for the production of heterologous proteins or peptides have been described using microbial, insect or mammalian cells, and plants. all have advantages and disadvantages, depending on the type of protein to be produced, the complexity of downstream processes to recover it, and the cost. microbial systems based on bacteria and yeasts, provide high yield production by fermentation processes and are easy to handle, but the inclusion body formation requires solubilization and refolding . procedures and the use of insect and mammalian cells, or transgenic animals are complex and expensive, with the additional disadvantages of the slow-scaling up and the ethical concerns  <cit> . transgenic plants offer several advantages for production of amps in a cost effective manner, and therapeutic proteins have already been produced . in recent years, commercial plant-derived proteins have been produced using cereal seeds , and rice has been chosen in several cases as a platform  <cit> . different rice promoters showing a seed-specific expression pattern have been described  <cit> , and valuable recombinant proteins including vaccines, antibodies, cytokines, hormones or enzymes have been successfully produced in rice seeds . most of these rice based platforms produced peptides as multimers  or as a fusion to a large protein carrier such as storage proteins . however, several reports show the difficulty to produce small peptides in the rice seed due to its small size, low stability and/or susceptibility to protease degradation in planta  <cit> . in order to achieve the production of cecmel <dig> peptides using plant biofactories, synthetic analogs of the bp <dig> peptide that fulfill specific requirements for optimal production in plants were previously described  <cit> . peptide modifications were made to increase peptide size, and to incorporate retention signals targeting the peptide to specific cell compartments . a priori this strategy reduces the risks of amp degradation and/or toxicity towards plant cells. the compounds  were evaluated for antimicrobial, hemolytic and cytotoxic activities, and several were considered as suitable candidates to be produced in plant biofactories.

the aim of the present study was to determine the feasibility of using the rice seed as a biofactory to produce and recover a bp <dig> derivative, the bp <dig> antibacterial peptide . this peptide has a lytic mode of action on several plant pathogenic bacteria. promoters of rice seed storage protein genes were used to direct endosperm-specific expression of the amp gene, and stable transgenic rice plants accumulating the amp in the seed endosperm were generated. the peptide was easily purified from rice seeds, and showed antimicrobial activity. moreover, transgenic seedlings showed resistance to pathogen infection suggesting that the plant produced bp <dig> peptide was also biologically active in the rice seed.

RESULTS
based on the library of bp <dig> derivatives  <cit> , in which modifications in peptide sequences were introduced to facilitate their production in plant systems, we selected the bp <dig> peptide for its production in rice seeds. this peptide consisted of a magainin fragment linked to the original sequence of the bp <dig> through an agpa hinge region, and the kdel retention signal sequence  at the c-terminus . we reasoned that retention into the endoplasmatic reticulum will protect the peptide from proteolytic degradation while reducing the risk of toxicity to the plant cell. the bp <dig> peptide exhibited strong bactericidal effect against several plant pathogenic bacteria with very low hemolytic activity. phytotoxicity of bp <dig> to tobacco cells was observed by infiltration only at concentrations 50– <dig> times higher than minimal inhibitory concentration mic values  <cit> . the selected peptide has a strong cationic net charge  with an amphipathic character .

generation and characterization of transgenic rice plants expressing a synthetic bp <dig> gene in seed tissues
three different constructs were obtained in which the synthetic bp <dig> gene was cloned under the control of an endosperm-specific rice promoter  . the promoters and the signal peptide coding sequence of the rice glutelin b <dig>  b <dig> and globulin genes were used to direct the expression of the bp <dig> gene and accumulation of the transgene product in the seed endosperm.fig.  <dig> schematic representation of the plant expression vectors for the expression of the bp <dig> gene in the rice endosperm. a three different constructs in pcambia vector  in which the synthetic gene was cloned between the endosperm-specific promoter including the signal peptide coding sequence of the corresponding seed storage protein  and the nopaline synthase terminator . relevant restriction enzyme sites for cloning purposes are indicated. the hptii gene encoding resistance to hygromycin under the control of the camv35s promoter and terminator was contained into the t-dna region of pc. lb, left border; rb, right border of t-dna. arrows indicate the orientation of the sequence. b the chimeric bp <dig> peptide corresponding to the fusion of bp <dig> -melittin  hybrid, in green) linked through the hinge sequence  to a magainin fragment peptide ; and extended with er retention signal . for details, see additional file 1: figure s1




transgenic t <dig> and homozygous plants were morphologically similar to the wild-type untransformed plants.

all the regenerated rice lines recovered from different transformation events had the complete cassette for bp <dig> expression integrated into their genomes, as revealed by pcr analysis and subsequent sequencing of the pcr products . most transgenic lines carried a single copy insertion of both selectable marker and the bp <dig> gene, that is  <dig> % for the pglb1:bp178-lines, 100% for the pglub4:bp178-lines and 50% for the pglub1:bp178-lines. as expected, a 3: <dig> segregation ratio was observed in t <dig> events harbouring a single copy of the transgene. single copy events were used as the parental lines to obtain homozygous lines in the t <dig> generation. thus, independent homozygous lines from pcglb1:bp178:nos , pcglub4:bp178:nos  and pcglub1:bp178:nos  transformation events were selected for further analysis. additionally, qpcr analysis confirmed stable transgene inheritance through successive generations .

production and accumulation of bp <dig> peptide in transgenic rice seeds
the total protein profiles of transgenic and wt seeds were initially examined by sds-page, and no significant differences were observed in the accumulation of native storage proteins  when comparing transgenic and wt seed protein profiles .fig.  <dig> bp <dig> peptide accumulates in the endosperm of glb1:bp <dig> transgenic rice seeds without altering accumulation levels of native storage proteins. a coomassie blue staining of pb extracts from the indicated seeds. ev indicates seeds from plants transformed with the pcambia  <dig> empty vector. b ponceau staining of protein samples  c western-blot analysis and quantification of the bp <dig> peptide in the protein body-enriched fractions  from mature seed endosperms of the indicated pglb1:bp <dig>  pglub4:bp <dig>  pglub1:bp <dig> and empty vector  lines. the accumulation levels of bp <dig> peptide were quantified with the quantity tools of the chemidoc program using the  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  μg amounts of synthetic bp <dig> peptide as a reference . numbers below the western blot lanes correspond to μg of bp <dig> peptide. d western-blot analysis of protein body-enriched fractions  from embryos, leaves or roots of the indicated pglb1:bp <dig>  and empty vector  lines. for comparative purposes,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  μg of synthetic bp <dig> peptide were run simultaneously in the tricine-sds gels. immunodetection was performed using specific polyclonal anti-bp178kdel antibodies and coloured phosphatase alkaline reaction




the promoters and the signal peptide coding sequence of the rice glutelin b <dig>  b <dig> and globulin genes were used to direct the expression of the bp <dig> gene and accumulation of the transgene product. previous studies demonstrated the capability of these regulatory sequences to produce the cecropin a peptide in the protein bodies of the rice endosperm. accordingly, in this work we prepared protein body -enriched fractions from mature seeds of transgenic lines harbouring a bp <dig> construct following the procedure previously described  <cit>  .

western-blot analysis of pb proteins, using an anti-bp <dig> polyclonal antibody, revealed accumulation of an immunoreactive band, putatively bp <dig> peptide, in the pb enriched fraction of the transgenic seeds harbouring the pglb1:bp <dig> construct, which was absent in the same fraction of the empty vector seeds . also, a large variation in accumulation of bp <dig> was observed among the different pglb1:bp <dig> lines generated . we also noticed that the apparent molecular weight of the bp <dig> peptide in tricine-sds page was larger  than the expected molecular weight for the corresponding peptide . in addition, when high concentrations of the synthetic bp <dig> peptide were subjected to immunoblot analysis, at least three immunoreactive bands of different mobility were detected , that could be associated to peptide multimerization. no accumulation of the bp178-immunoreactive band was observed in protein extracts obtained from embryos, leaves or roots from plants that expressed the bp <dig> gene under the control of the seed-specific promoter .

lc-ms/ms proteomic analyses allowed the detection of tryptic-derived peptides from bp <dig> that were unequivocally identified in the bp178-enriched protein body fraction of pglb1:bp <dig> lines, but not in the empty vector controls. the expected tryptic fragments for the peptide are indicated in additional file  <dig> . lc-ms/ms data also confirmed that the ~8 kda immunodetected polypeptide  corresponded to the expected bp <dig> peptide in seeds of the pglb1:bp <dig> lines, whereas the tryptic peptides from the glb <dig> signal peptide were not detected in the pb samples. analysis by lc-ms/ms also demonstrated that bp <dig> accumulated in the protein body enriched fraction obtained from pglub1:bp <dig> and pglub4:bp <dig> seeds, but at very low levels . among the three strategies assessed for amp production, the pglb1:bp <dig> seeds showed the highest levels of bp <dig> accumulation. among other factors, the orientation of the expression cassettes could be associated with the increased expression of the bp <dig> gene in the pglb1:bp <dig> compared to that of pglub1:bp <dig> or pglub4:bp <dig> seeds.fig.  <dig> stability of the bp <dig> peptide accumulated in 3 years-old seeds. the endosperm tissue was manually dissected from mature seeds  and germinating rice seeds . protein extracts  were separated by tricine-sds gels, transferred onto pvdf membrane, and incubated with the anti-bp <dig> antibody followed by anti-rabbit igg  alkaline phosphatase conjugated secondary antibody. ev, rice plants with the empty pcambia  <dig> vector were used as a negative control, and  <dig>  μg of synthetic bp <dig> were used as reference control. arrows, indicate bp <dig> a-related bands in rice extracts. numbers in the left side indicate the size of the molecular markers . lower panels show ponceau staining of protein samples




further analysis confirmed that the bp <dig> peptide remained stable during the germination process, as the peptide was detected in the endosperm tissue of the germinating seeds . no bp178-related degradation products were observed in protein extracts from germinating seeds . moreover, the in planta produced bp <dig> peptide was found to accumulate in a stable manner during storage of the rice seeds as it could be detected in the transgenic seeds even after long periods of storage , when stored at room temperature.

preparative scale purification and yield estimation of the bp <dig> peptide produced in seeds of transgenic rice
knowing that the bp <dig> peptide accumulates in the rice endosperm being detected in the pb enriched fraction, we focused on the development of a method suitable for purification of this peptide from transgenic rice seeds at a preparative scale. the transgenic line  <dig>  harbouring the pglb1:bp <dig> gene construct presented the highest level of resistance to dickeya sp. infection . for this, transgenic plants harbouring the pglb1:bp <dig>  were selected. pb enriched fractions were obtained from  <dig>  seeds  of transgenic pglb1:bp <dig> event. as control, pb fractions were obtained from empty vector plants. the procedure used for purification of bp <dig> from rice seeds is shown in fig. 4a. in each case, approximately 250 mg of pb proteins were obtained. next, protein extracts were obtained from pb enriched fraction by precipitation using acetone-tca-dtt. interestingly, under these conditions, the bp <dig> was found to be soluble, and the precipitated seed storage proteins were easily removed from the protein body extracts by centrifugation. bp <dig> peptide was recovered from the acetone fraction, processed as described in the experimental procedures, and further used. western blot analysis confirmed the presence of bp <dig> peptide in the acetone fraction . this procedure was used to recover the bp <dig> peptide accumulating in seeds of five independent pglb1:bp <dig> lines. the bp <dig> lines accumulated the peptide in the range of  <dig>  to  <dig>  μg /grain, as determined by western-blot analysis using dilution series of bp <dig> . the highest contents of bp <dig> was found in rice seeds of line  <dig> , as  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/grain . the mean bp <dig> peptide yield for the  <dig> homozygous bp <dig> lines was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg bp178/grain for the 3 year-old seeds, and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg bp178/grain in the case of fresh seeds . there were no statistically significant differences between the bp <dig> accumulation levels among 0 year-old and 3 year-old seeds, according to an anova analysis .fig.  <dig> purification, quantification and antibacterial activity of the bp <dig> peptide recovered from the pglb1:bp <dig> rice seeds. a schematic procedure for purification. bp <dig> peptide was recovered at high purity in the acetone supernatant  b tris-tricine sds-page and western-blot analysis using anti-bp <dig> antibodies of fractions recovered during the purification process described in  starting from protein body fractions  from seeds from pglb1:bp <dig> line  <dig> . numbers in the top of panel  correspond to:  <dig>  supernatant;  <dig>  pelleted protein bodies;  <dig>  pellet. c peptide yield from seeds of the indicated pglb1:bp <dig> events. the amount of bp <dig> was calculated by comparing the signal intensity of known amounts of standard . values correspond to the mean of at least  <dig> independent assays and the standard error is indicated. d antimicrobial activity against dickeya sp. of two batches of purified bp178-fractions from pglb1:bp <dig> lines. empty vector  and reference synthetic bp <dig> peptide were used as control. mean values of two replicates and the standard error are indicated




bp <dig> peptide produced in rice seeds exhibits biological activity
the antimicrobial activity of the in planta produced bp <dig> peptide was assessed against the seedling bacterial pathogen dickeya sp. using a contact test. the bacterial suspension was incubated with bp <dig> purified from pglb1:bp <dig> seeds or with purified fractions from empty vector seeds. the bp <dig> contents of the two batches of plant derived bp <dig> used were  <dig>  and  <dig>  μg/μl, respectively. as expected, empty vector pb enriched fractions had no bp <dig>  therefore, in the antimicrobial activity assay, the corresponding total amounts were for the synthetic bp <dig> of  <dig>  μg, and for the purified bp <dig> from transgenic seeds of  <dig>  and  <dig>  μg, for each batch, respectively. the plant derived bp <dig> extracts and the reference synthetic bp <dig> peptide gave similar bactericidal activities , but the concentrations of the plant derived bp <dig> peptide were around forty times higher.

enhanced resistance of bp178-rice seeds to infection by bacterial and fungal plant pathogens
because the bp <dig> was found to accumulate in the rice seeds, we investigated resistance to pathogen infection in germinating seeds and seedlings. dickeya sp. 1552- <dig> , a seedling bacterial pathogen, was used . in the presence of dickeya sp., seedlings expressing pglb1:bp <dig> and pglub4:bp <dig> were able to germinate and presented normal root and shoot morphology comparable to that of control seedlings. these seedlings, showed a consistent phenotype of resistance to infection compared to control plants  that showed susceptibility to dickeya infection. differences in susceptibility occurred among lines harbouring the same transgene. in contrast, the pglub1: bp <dig> lines showed susceptibility to dickeya sp., at similar levels than control seeds. these plants exhibited short and brownish shoots, and in most cases were unable to germinate in the presence of the bacterial phytopathogen.fig.  <dig> resistance of bp <dig> rice seeds to dickeya sp. infection. a phenotypical appearance of wild-type , empty vector  and the transgenic seedlings carrying the indicated transgenes after 7 days in contact with dickeya sp.  <dig> . <dig> bacterial suspensions . pictures are representative of at least  <dig> independent assays in which  <dig> seeds per line were analysed. b germination capability of dickeya-infected t <dig> rice seeds expressing the bp <dig> gene. mean germination index  in inoculated  or non-inoculated  seeds at 7 days after inoculation. values correspond to the mean germination index of two independent assays. the standard error is also indicated. the asterisks indicate statistically significant differences compared to the wt and empty vector mean 




resistance of bp178-rice seedlings against f. verticillioides, a seed-borne fungal pathogen associated with bakanae in rice, was also assessed. it was observed a better germination capability of the fungal-infected transgenic seeds expressing the bp <dig> gene under the control of an endosperm-specific promoter, compared to control seeds  . most of wt and ev seeds were unable to germinate in the presence of the fungal pathogen and in some cases infected seedlings also show crown and stem rot, as well as low number of roots. more in detail, the expression of a bp <dig> gene under the control of the glub <dig> and glb <dig> promoter resulted in higher level of protection to f. verticillioides infection than glub4:bp178-seeds.fig.  <dig> resistance of bp178-rice seeds to fusarium verticillioides infection. a phenotypical appearance of wild-type  and transgenic seedlings carrying the indicated transgenes or the empty vector  7 days after germination in contact with f. verticillioides spore suspensions . pictures are representative of  <dig> independent assays b germination capability of the fungal inoculated transgenic seeds referred to wild-type seeds. values correspond to the mean germination rate and standard errors of three independent assays in which at least  <dig> independent lines per transgene were analysed. asterisks denote statistically significant differences with wild-type and empty vector plants 




discussion
in this work, we generated transgenic rice plants accumulating the bp <dig> peptide in the rice seed endosperm, using endosperm-specific promoters to drive transgene expression. the dna sequence encoding the n-terminal signal peptide of rice storage proteins was fused to the bp <dig> gene, which also contained a c-terminal extension encoding the kdel sequence for retention in the er. the homozygous rice seeds accumulating the bp <dig> peptide showed resistance to infection by two plant pathogens, suggesting that the in planta-produced peptide was biologically active. moreover, the bp <dig> peptide was easily purified from the transgenic rice seeds and was biologically active. there are several lines of evidence to suggest that bp <dig> accumulates in pbs, while subcellular location was not confirmed by direct methods . such evidences include the accumulation of a similar protein peptide  to pbs when identical regulatory sequences were utilized for cloning and transformation, and also the presence of bp <dig> in cell fractions that have been shown to be enriched for protein bodies  <cit> .

it is worthwhile to mention that previous studies failed to obtain stable transgenic rice plants expressing certain bp <dig> derivative genes under the control of a constitutive promoter, suggesting toxicity of these amps to the host plant  <cit> . in a few cases, the bp <dig> derivative genes were constitutively expressed in rice, but resulted in abnormal development of the plants  <cit> . on the other hand, the suitability of endosperm-specific promoters to drive expression of the cecropin a gene in the rice endosperm has been demonstrated  <cit> . altogether, these findings highlight the relevance of using the appropriate strategy for production of amps in transgenic rice to avoid undesirable effects, particularly for production of the bp <dig> antibacterial peptide in rice seed tissues.

the bp <dig> peptide accumulated in the endosperm tissue of the transgenic seeds, but not in embryo, leaf or root tissues, which is in agreement with the already described seed-specific activity of the glub <dig>  glub <dig> and glb <dig> promoters  <cit> . it is known that both glutelin and globulin rice seed storage proteins are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum and deposited in the pbii  of rice endosperm, due to cis-acting rna localization signals present in the transcripts  <cit> . however, the sorting signals for seed storage proteins deposition into pbii have not yet been identified in rice  <cit> . our results illustrate the utility of using an endosperm-specific promoter and signal peptide sequence of seed storage proteins for production of bp <dig> in protein body enriched fractions of transgenic rice seed. in this context, there are examples with other peptides in which a similar strategy has been successful  <cit>  as well as unsuccessful  <cit> . therefore, it should be considered the possibility that the bp <dig> peptide accumulates without the targeting signal sequence in the signal peptide. for instance, the bp <dig> peptide might interact with seed storage proteins, as has been previously described for other peptides  <cit> . even, protein aggregation may also play a role in protein sorting, as it has been reported for human lysozyme that contains an internal targeting signal which directs the recombinant protein to the pbs  <cit> . clearly, further studies are required to confirm targeting of the bp <dig> peptide to pbs and to identify the molecular determinants involved.

fractionation procedures, in combination with western-blot and lc-ms/ms analyses allowed us to demonstrate that the bp <dig> peptide was efficiently produced and accumulated in the endosperm in bp178-transgenic events. in addition, this production was without apparent interference on the accumulation of the seed storage proteins such as glutelins and prolamins. in contrast, other studies reported adverse effects of peptide accumulation in rice seeds. for instance, the production of transgenic rice seeds accumulating the major japanese cedar pollen allergens, cry j  <dig> and cry j  <dig> at high levels, was accompanied by an important reduction in the accumulation of endogenous seed storage proteins  <cit> . similarly, a high level of accumulation in the transgenic seeds of a hybrid peptide comprising seven predominant human t cell epitopes resulted in alterations in the accumulation of seed storage proteins  <cit> . presumably, the accumulation of the bp <dig> peptide in the endosperm of the rice seed prevents the er stress response as previously described by other authors  <cit> . alternatively, the accumulation of the bp <dig> might not have reached the threshold level required to induce er stress.

the in planta produced bp <dig> peptide exhibited an apparent molecular weight in tris-tricine sds-page  higher than expected . a similar phenomenon has been reported in transgenic plants expressing other amps  <cit> . different possibilities can explain the abnormal electrophoretic mobility of the plant produced bp <dig> peptide, such as the formation of self-assembled peptide multimers, an additional amino acidic fragment between the c-terminal of the signal peptide sequence  and the n-terminal sequence of the bp <dig> peptide , post-translational modifications or an improper processing of the signal peptide. however, the tryptic peptide corresponding to the signal peptide was not detected by lc-ms/ms analysis of the seed produced bp <dig> peptide. it is also known that proteins that enter into the secretory pathway are often modified in plant cells by the addition of sugar chains. probably, the strong basic and amphipathic character of the bp <dig> and/or multimerization might be responsible of its abnormal electrophoretic mobility in sds-page gels.

a successful use of rice seeds as biofactories of amps requires the stable expression of the transgene through successive generations of plants, as well as stability of the peptide during seed storage. bp <dig> accumulation remained stable during storage of the rice seeds, at least for three years, without significant loss of antimicrobial activity. this stability can be associated to the adequate biochemical environment of the pbs, which might protect the peptide from the action of endogenous proteases  <cit> . furthermore, the amino acid composition and structure of the bp <dig> peptide can be also responsible for the integrity of the peptide under these conditions as has been argued for other peptides  <cit> .

in the present work, a simplified method to recover bp <dig> peptide from seeds was developed. the procedure consists of a two-step centrifugation to partially-purify protein bodies, from which the peptide was solubilized in an acetone mix, whereas the seed storage proteins were precipitated and removed. the plant derived bp <dig> peptide showed bactericidal activity. although the activity was similar to the synthetic bp <dig> peptide, the concentrations were around forty times higher. it is possible there was a loss of activity of the plant derived bp <dig> peptide related to its abnormal electrophoretic mobility.

in the literature there are many examples of amp genes that have been successfully expressed in rice to obtain disease resistant transgenic plants . however, less attention has been paid to develop plant biofactories for the production of amps and to recover the expected product. the processes for extraction and purification of peptides in general and of cationic amphipathic amps in particular, are often laborious and costly, often requiring several steps  <cit> , and frequently complicated by the interaction of the expression product with tissue components or with the equipment used  <cit> .

current literature on production of peptides in rice seeds shows both successful and unsuccessful experiences, but in most cases repeated tandems or fusion proteins were used . the system here developed for production of bp <dig> was efficient without the need of using repeated tandems or fusion of the amp to a larger protein carrier.

among the three strategies assayed in this work , seeds from pglb1:bp <dig> rice plants showed the highest accumulation levels of bp <dig> in the seed endosperm . however, this value may represent an underestimation of the actual concentrations, because immunoblot detection of short and basic amps might underestimate the peptide yield  <cit> . in addition, the yield of bp <dig>  was in the upper range of the above mentioned reports  and four times higher than for cecropin a using a similar strategy   <cit> . the observation that the in planta produced bp <dig> peptide was biologically active and effectively protects germinating seeds against phytopathogens is in agreement with the accumulation of effective levels to confer antimicrobial activity  <cit> . this data additionally shows that the production of bp <dig> appears as a useful approach for engineering broad-spectrum protection against seed-borne pathogens in rice grains.

in summary, the strategy presented here for expression of peptide bp <dig> solves the limitation that was encountered with genes encoding highly cationic α-helical small peptides showing toxicity towards the host plant  <cit> . overall, these results suggest that the endosperm tissue of the rice seed can be considered as an appropriated platform for the accumulation of bp <dig>  with no need of complex downstream processing steps for the elimination of endogenous storage proteins. the method requires minimum purification and processing steps, due to the solubility in acetone of the transgene product, with a yield suitable for their purification and further use of bp <dig> as an antimicrobial agent. the system also allows for long-term storage of the amp-accumulating rice seeds and does not affect the normal growth and development of the plant. thus, the rice-based bp <dig> peptide plant biofactory offers new possibilities for the sustainable production of this peptide and application, not only in crop protection, but also in other fields .
