BACKGROUND
the synthesis of tryptophan is a common metabolic capability of microorganisms and higher plants, which is not provided by mammals. the prokaryotic trp operon encodes the enzymes catalysing the final and pathway-specific steps from chorismate to l-tryptophan. for more than  <dig> years, the enterobacterial operon has now been the classical model system for studying the evolutionary relation of genes and enzymes  as well as gene regulation. considering gene regulation, several, conceptually quite different mechanisms have been described for the trp operon. most of them were elucidated in bacterial species . however, regulation of trp operon expression has also been shown for the archaea methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicus  <cit>  and thermococcus kodakaraensis  <cit> . the reason for an elaborated regulation may be the fact that tryptophan is one of the amino acids, whose biochemical synthesis is very expensive  <cit> . besides regulation, other features of tryptophan biosynthesis have been studied extensively. the composition of the operon and several aspects of its evolution have been analysed  <cit> , and for each enzyme, at least one 3d-structure has been determined. taken together, the trp operon is besides the ribosomal protein operons one of the best-characterised gene clusters occurring in microorganisms. its investigation has provided fundamental insights into many aspects of bacterial genetics and enzymology; see  <cit> .

the canonical trp operon encodes seven enzymes responsible for the synthesis of l-tryptophan from chorismate. the first reaction is catalysed by the anthranilate synthase, a glutamine amidotransferase, which is a complex consisting of the larger synthase  and a smaller glutaminase  subunit. the anthranilate phosphoribosyl transferase  provides the glutamine amidotransferase function that allows glutamine to serve as the amino donor in anthranilate formation. the two subsequent enzymes, trpf and trpc, catalyse the isomerisation of phosphoribosylanthranilate and the synthesis of indole-3-glycerol phosphate, respectively.

trpa and trpb constitute the αββα tryptophan synthase complex which catalyses the final reaction from indole-3-glycerole phosphate + l-serine to l-tryptophan + h2o. the α subunit  cleaves indoleglycerol-3-phosphate to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and indole. the latter is transported through a hydrophobic tunnel to the associated β subunit , where it is condensed with l-serine to yield l-tryptophan  <cit> . a sophisticated mechanism of allostery links the α and β monomers of the synthase; see e.g.  <cit> .

several trp enzymes represent paradigmatically larger classes of proteins having similar function or protein architecture: trpg is similar to hish  and other glutaminases of type i glutamine amidotransferases  <cit> . trpf, trpc and trpa are all  <dig> barrels possessing similar phosphate binding sites  <cit> . the basic  <dig> barrel is the most common enzyme fold in the pdb database of known protein structures  <cit> .

for the bacterial trp genes, the following order was determined: large anthranilate synthase subunit , small anthranilate synthase subunit , anthranilate phosphoribosyl transferase , indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase , phosphoribosyl anthranilate isomerase , tryptophan synthase β subunit  and tryptophan synthase α subunit , or abbreviated trpegdcfba  <cit> . the gene-fusions trpgd and trpeg have been observed in several species; moreover, in other genomes, the operon is broken up into several gene clusters. in archeal genomes, order of trp genes is highly variable. in sulfolobus solfataricus, an intact operon trpbadfegc is observed. in haloferax volcanii, the trp operon is divided into two isolated clusters, trpcba and trpdfeg, separated by more than  <dig> kb. in the genome of natronomonas pharaonis, there exist three homologs of trpd and two homologs of trpb, trpe and trpg each. pyrococcus horikoshii completely lacks the genes for tryptophan synthesis .

the genes trpb, trpa and trpe, trpg are frequently in the same order and in close proximity, i.e. they comprise the linkage groups trpba and trpeg. in both cases, the gene products constitute a bienzyme complex, whose active centres interact with each other. because they occur in both bacterial and archeal genomes, these linkage groups have been identified as ancestral  <cit> . a reconstruction of the tentative ancestral trp operon is hampered by the observation that trp genes are poor phylogenetic reporters. different rates of evolution, multiple gene duplications and convergent evolution, as a consequence of specific adaptation to environmental demands, may be the reason for inconsistencies seen in comparisons of phylogenies deduced from trp genes or rrna  <cit> . therefore, the evolution of each element of the trp operon has to be examined separately.

for evolutionary studies, tryptophan synthase is an especially interesting candidate. this enzyme has been analysed for decades in order to understand the structural basis and functional consequences of protein-protein interactions  <cit> . the isolated trpa and trpb proteins form stable, however poorly active α monomers and ββ homodimers, respectively  <cit> . their assembly to the native αββα complex induces conformational changes in both subunit types, as shown by x-ray crystallography for the pyrococcus furiosus synthase  <cit> . the result of this communication between the α and β subunits is a reciprocal activation by one to two orders of magnitude  <cit> . conformational changes crucial for the allosteric communication between the active sites of the α– and β-subunits have been analysed in detail for the salmonella typhimurium tryptophan synthase; see e.g.  <cit> .

the role of the β-subunit is of particular importance for the evolution of trp synthase. for archaea and bacteria, it is known that two variants of trpb genes occur, which can clearly be distinguished by their protein sequences  <cit> . the major group, harbouring proteins of type trpb <dig> includes the enzymes of enterobacteria and bacillus subtilis. the minor group  contains many archeal proteins. most prokaryotes like e. coli possess a single trpb <dig> gene. however, in several bacterial and archeal genomes, a combination of one trpb <dig> and one trpb <dig> gene occurs. in addition, some species exist, which have only one or two trpb <dig>  but no trpb <dig> gene. this variety prompted us to characterise the evolution of trpb and its interaction with trpa in detail, both biochemically and in silico.

based on biochemical findings, a model for the evolution of the tryptophan synthase complex has recently been introduced  <cit> . this model assumes the existence of an ancient and non operon-based trpb <dig>  after duplication, only one trpb <dig> gene presumably has been integrated into the trp operon. differences in evolutionary pressure may have been responsible for the divergence of non operon- and operon-based trpb genes. the coevolution with trpa may have led to a better adapted trpb <dig>  the data on complex formation and subunit activation led us consider existing trpb variants as representatives of evolutionary steps in the postulated model.

in this study, i have assessed this model by phylogenetic methods. two basic questions have been addressed: i) what is the evolutionary relationship of trpb <dig> and trpb2? ii) how did extant archeal trp operons evolve? extending previous work  <cit> , i will discuss novel hypotheses concerning the properties of trpb <dig> and operon formation. based on the content of  <dig> completely sequenced archeal genomes, comparative analyses of trp sequences, and their locations in genomes will be reported in order to reconstruct the evolution of trpb-type subunits and of the coevolution of trpa/trpb. it will be shown that trpb <dig> variants represent different stages of trpa/trpb cooperation and that trpb <dig> is favoured over trpb <dig> in certain environments. moreover, trpb <dig> has features of a more ancient trpb variant.

RESULTS
assessing the composition of trp gene clusters
in order to describe the composition of trp regulons in a quantitative manner and to compare their content in archeal and bacterial genomes, amigos  <cit>  was used. by comparing genomes, this program identifies gene clusters and rates each individual cluster element with a conscl-score. the conscl-score of an individual gene depends on i) the occurrence of this gene in a given gene cluster and ii) the global similarity of the genomes harbouring these clusters. thus, individual scores assess both the relatedness of genomes and the frequency with which individual genes are members of a cluster. the higher a score, the more pronounced is the occurrence of an individual gene in a given gene cluster. table  <dig> lists conscl-scores for elements of archeal and bacterial trp operons. the numbers indicate that in bacteria the clustering of trpa and trpb <dig> was stronger than that of all other trp genes. in archeal genomes, the clustering of trpe and trpg was most prominent. a reason for the lower score of trpb in archeal trp operons was the occurrence of two trpb variants  in these species. the scores signalled that trpb <dig> was more frequently part of an trp operon than trpb <dig>  moreover, the score for trpa was lower than that of trpe or trpg. it follows for archaea that trpa and trpb are less strictly integrated into trp operons than in bacteria. this suggests that either evolutionary pressure responsible for operon formation is less pronounced or that additional selective forces disfavour the integration of trpa and trpb into certain archeal trp operons.

note: the first two columns list score values deduced from representative sets of archeal and bacterial genomes. columns three and four list protein names, cog numbers, and protein function. the conscl-scores were determined by using amigos  <cit> . cog numbers indicate orthologous gene clusters as defined in the cog database  <cit> .

it has been hypothesised that trpb <dig> possesses a second function and acts as a serine deaminase  <cit> . this prediction has been deduced from the analysis of phyletic patterns, i.e. the absence of an encoded serine deaminase function in certain genomes. however, it has been shown that trpb <dig> of thermotoga maritima and trpb2_o proteins of sulfolobus solfataricus and t. maritima have poor serine deaminase activities  <cit> . an alternative method of non-homologous gene annotation is the exploitation of gene neighbourhoods  <cit> , as e.g. implemented with amigos. for trpb <dig>  amigos did not detect a second conserved gene neighbourhood besides the one constituting trp operons. thus, no clues for an additional function besides tryptophan synthesis have been deduced for trpb <dig> by this approach.

a naming code for trpb genes
the two variants of trpb occur in various genomes in different combinations  <cit> . in order to facilitate the analysis of phylogenetic trees, a naming scheme was introduced. names of genes and gene products were generated according to the scheme species_loc|type|tax. here, species is an abbreviation of the species name . loc indicates the position of the specific trpb gene relative to a putative trp operon . if two trpb genes occur in a genome, they were labelled _i  or _o . if only a single trpb gene occurred in the genome, it was labelled _s, if the gene was linked to trpa, and it was labelled _s, if it was separate from trpa. type indicates the gene type. it is  <dig> for trpb <dig> and  <dig> for trpb <dig>  finally, tax gives the taxonomical classification. it is c for crenarchaeota, e for euryarchaeota and b for bacteria. the following examples explain how to resolve sequence names: aperni_o2c was used to name a trpb gene in the genome of aeropyrum pernix , which occurred outside the trp operon  and was of type trpb <dig> . as a. pernix is a crenarchaeota, the name ends with a c. the _o notation indicates that a second trpb gene exists in a. pernix. this gene was consequently named aperni_i2c, as it is a trpb <dig> gene inside the trp operon. note that also pairs like tmarit_i1b and tmarit_o2b exist indicating the occurrence of a trpb <dig> gene inside and a trpb <dig> gene outside the trp operon. sacido_s2c is the designation of a trpb <dig> gene located inside the trp operon. as sulfolobus acidocaldarius possesses only one trpb gene, it was labelled with a _s. since thermoplasma volcanium possesses only one trpb gene, which is non operon-based and of type trpb <dig>  this gene was named tvolc_s2e. designations of the encoded proteins were assigned in a corresponding way.

determining the occurrence of trpb genes
in order to determine the distribution of trpb variants, the cog  <cit>  and the string database  <cit>  were used. for all completely sequenced archeal and bacterial genomes, their occurrence was determined and their location was identified. depending on the occurrence of trpb variants, archeal species were grouped into five categories, named species-types in the following. note that these species-types characterise the content of genomes. links to the above naming scheme for genes are gene location and type.

as table  <dig> shows, there were six archeal genomes possessing a single trpb gene of class trpb <dig> , four genomes with a single trpb gene of class trpb <dig> , five genomes harbouring one operon-based and one additional, non operon-based trpb <dig> each , ten species of type i1_o <dig>  and one species possessing one operon-based and at least one non operon-based trpb <dig> gene . the most frequent combination  was an operon-based trpb <dig> and a non operon-based trpb <dig> gene . n. pharaonis was the only archeal species of type i1_o <dig>  all five completely sequenced crenarchaeota possess exclusively genes of class trpb <dig>

note: the occurrence and the location of trpb genes were coded according to the following scheme used in the top line: s <dig> species possess exactly one, non operon-based trpb <dig> gene, s2: ditto, the gene is located inside the trp operon. trpb <dig> was treated analogously. i2_o <dig> are species possessing an trpb <dig> gene inside and a second trpb <dig> outside the operon, i1_o <dig> are species with an operon-based trpb <dig> and a non operon-based trpb <dig>  and i1_o <dig> are species possessing an operon-based and at least one non operon-based trpb <dig>  the number of genomes having the same species-type is given in brackets. the acronyms following the species name classify trpb genes; see results. numbers give tryptophan codons occurring in the respective gene. the abbreviations indicate hyperthermophilic , thermoacidophilic , thermophilic , mesophilic , halophilic , or hyperthermophilic + halophilic species . the last line of the table gives mean values for the occurrence of tryptophan codons.

bacterial species did not contribute species-types noticeably different from those observed among archaea . both geobacter species represent special cases most plausibly explained by ongoing genomic rearrangements: gsulfu_i2b is an operon-based trpb <dig> gene of type trpb2_o. the trp operon of g. sulfurreducens harbours both a trpb <dig> and a trpb <dig> gene. according to the annotation, the trpb <dig> gene  contains a frameshift and is annotated as a pseudogene  <cit> . a direct neighbour of trpb <dig> in g. metallireducens is a transposase, making a recent transfer of this gene plausible. in comparison to archaea, the occurrence of trpb <dig> was less frequent in bacterial genomes and none contained exclusively trpb <dig> genes.

assessing phylogenetic relationship of trp genes
sequences originating from all archaea and several representative bacteria were selected for a phylogenetic classification of trp genes. multiple sequence alignments were created by using m-coffee  <cit> , and trees were constructed and evaluated using splitstrees  <cit> . figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> are plots of unrooted trees generated for protein sequences of trpa, trpb, trpd, trpe, and trpg. in order to assess the statistical strength of individual edges, bootstrap resampling was used. for relevant edges, bootstrap values were plotted; see figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  the trees were analysed in detail, as follows.

trpb
in agreement with previous findings  <cit> , trpb <dig> and trpb <dig> clearly fall into two distinct groups. this distinction was supported by a high bootstrap value; see figure  <dig>  moreover, among trpb <dig> sequences a finer sub-clustering could be deduced, which was in agreement with the location of the genes. one group  consisted of products of trpb <dig> genes not located in operons.  <dig> out of  <dig> elements were trpb <dig> sequences originating from i1_o <dig> species, i.e. species possessing besides an isolated lying trpb <dig> an additional, operon-based trpb <dig>  the genes paerip_o2c and aperni_o2c of the two i2_o <dig> species pyrobaculum aerophilum and a. pernix belonged to this group too. these two species possess a trp operon containing a trpb <dig> gene. bacterial trpb2_o sequences, which originated from the i1_o <dig> species t. maritima and g. metallireducens did not form an isolated subtree. this finding argues for a common origin of bacterial and archeal trpb2_o genes.

the other two subgroups of trpb <dig> variants were clearly distinct from the trpb2_o cluster. the sequences of these clusters originated from archeal s <dig> , s <dig> or i2_o <dig> species , i.e. species possessing exclusively one or two trpb <dig> genes. these sequences formed two clearly separated sets. the first set, named trpb2_i, subsumes operon-based trpb <dig> genes, and harboured stokod_i2c, sacido_s2c, ssolfa_i2c, ptorri_i2e, apern_i2c, and paerop_i2c. the second set, named trpb2_a, consisted of ptorri_o2e, stokod_o2c, ssolfo_o2c, tacido_s2e, and tvolca_s2e, and subsumed trpb <dig> genes located outside trp operons. for thermoplasma volcanium and thermoplasma acidophilum, these trpb <dig> genes were the only trpb genes, for s. solfataricus, s. tokodaii and p. torridus, a second, however distinguishable trpb <dig> gene of type trpb2_i was part of the trp operon. proteins of type trpb2_i formed two finer subgroups: those of p. torridus and the sulfolobaceae resembled more sequences of trpb2_a. those of a. pernix and p. aerophilum, which possess a non operon-based trpb2_o gene, were different both from trpb2_a and from trpb2_o sequences; see figure  <dig>  all relevant edges separating these groups are due to their high bootstrap value statistically highly significant.

as a single exception, the genome of p. horikoshii did not follow the general classification scheme. it possesses a single trpb <dig> gene, which is of type trpb2_o and not – as expected – of type trpb2_a. however, this genome lacks all the other trp genes, which has been previously interpreted as reductive evolution  <cit> . the occurrence of a trpb2_o gene might be due to the loss of the complete trp operon after speciation of trpb2_i and trpb2_o. the fact that the p. horikoshii trpb2_o gene was not affected by the reduction has been considered as an argument for assigning to it an other selective function  <cit> , which has not been identified yet. as noted above, the two bacterial geobacter species represent special cases associated with the presumptive rearrangement of trp genes. briefly, the trpb variants can be characterised as follows: trpb <dig> genes occur exclusively in trp operons. trpb2_o variants represent genes occurring outside operons in those species that have an operon-based trpb <dig>  several archeal species possess exclusively trpb <dig> genes: if only one trpb <dig> gene exists, it is of type trpb2_a, if two trpb <dig> genes occur, one is an operon-based trpb2_i, the second a trpb2_a, or a trpb2_o gene.

trpa
correlated with trpb speciation, trpa proteins showed a division into two, statistically highly significant subgroups; see figure  <dig>  the larger trpa <dig> group consisted of trpa sequences originating from genomes that possess a trpb <dig> gene. most likely, trpa <dig> proteins interact with the operon encoded trpb <dig> and thus fall into the same class. the smaller trpa <dig> group contained exclusively trpa proteins of species-types s <dig>  s <dig>  or i2_o <dig>  i.e. trpa proteins whose putative interaction partner is exclusively a trpb <dig> protein. the high bootstrap value of  <dig>  for the central edge emphasises the distinction made between trpa <dig> and trpa <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  i2_o <dig> species formed three statistically significant subtrees; compare figure  <dig>  these harboured the trpa sequences of  sulfolobaceae,  thermoplasmatales  and  p. aerophilum, and a. pernix. the composition of these groups is in agreement with the trpb2_a and trpb2_i groups in figure  <dig> and indicates the coevolution of trpb <dig> variants with trpa.

trpd, trpe, and trpg
in all three trees , both the proteins of thermoplasmatales and of the three sulfolobaceae constituted sub-clusters. the edges determined for trpd or trpe entries of these species have similar lengths as those calculated for trpa or trpb. especially for the trpa and trpb genes of these species, an increased rate of evolution has been previously postulated  <cit> . however, the comparison of trees and edge lengths showed that in these species evolutionary divergence is similarly high for several proteins encoded by the trp operon. these findings argue against a specifically increased rate of trpa and trpb evolution. in general, smaller genomes evolve faster  <cit> . therefore, a higher evolutionary rate in the trp genes of thermoplasmatales is more plausible explained by a general trend, which is due to their smaller genome size.

interestingly, no sub-clustering into smaller, distinctly separated groups was observed in trpe and trpg, which form like trpa and trpb a heteromeric complex. the above finding distinguishes the subunits of tryptophan synthase from those of anthranilate synthase. trpg was characterised as the evolutionary most stable trp protein by the compactness of its phylogenetic tree; see figure  <dig> 

the three euryarchaeota halobacterium , haloarcula marismortui  and natronomonas pharaonis  constituted an isolated group in all five trees ; edge lengths were comparable to those of s <dig> or i2_o <dig> species. this congruence indicates an elevated evolutionary rate for all elements of these trp operons. note that these operons harbour trpb <dig> genes.

analysing typical differences in trpa and trpb sequences
the phylogenetic tree depicted in figure  <dig> illustrates that all trpb variants can be sorted into four, clearly separated groups. the tree did however not allow to deduce the degree of sequence similarity and to infer whether these differences were subtle sequence variations broadly distributed in the whole sequence or larger indels . table  <dig> lists the results of pairwise sequence comparisons generated by using blast  <cit> . the selected sequences represent the species-types s <dig>  i2_o <dig>  i1_o <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig>  as expected, sequence similarity values are in agreement with tree composition. importantly, for all pairwise comparisons, more than 25% identical residues were determined. therefore, all trpb variants should most probably have the same overall 3d-structure  <cit> .

note: the sequences represent species-types s <dig>  i2_o <dig>  i1_o <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig>  all pairs were compared by using blast with default parameters. for each pair, the fraction of identical residues, similar residues, and inserted gaps is given in percent. for the generation of protein names, see results.

in order to characterise sequence differences in detail, multiple sequence alignments  were generated on the basis of a representative selection of trpa and trpb sequences. figure  <dig> lists for trpb the msa, residue conservation, secondary structure and the location of the interface area. residues interacting with ligands and residues, which are characteristic for trpb <dig> and trpb <dig> respectively, were labelled. 3d-data were deduced from the x-ray structure of pfurio_i1e, i.e. the operon-based trpb <dig> protein of p. furiosus  <cit> , which has pdb code 1wdw. for ssolfa_o2c, the 2d-structure was predicted by using jpred  <cit> . sdppred  <cit>  was employed to identify those residues, which separated trpb <dig> and trpb <dig> due to their skewed or bimodal distribution. in the following, positions and residues are referenced according to the sequence pfurio_i1e. annotations referring active site residues and the interface originate from the pdbsum page and the macromolecular structure database of the embl-ebi.

the msa shows that nearly all differences between trpb <dig> and trpb <dig> are due to larger indels, in agreement with  <cit> . interestingly, an insertion of  <dig> to  <dig> residues between positions  <dig> and  <dig> occurred coincidently in trpb2_a and trpb2_o sequences, i.e. exclusively in non operon-based proteins. all considered trpb <dig> and trpb2_i sequences lack this subsequence, which was not predicted as a well-defined 2d-element by jpred. several representatives belonging to these two sets of operon-based proteins were shown to interact with trpa  <cit> . therefore, it is probable that this putative loop influences the allosteric communication with trpa. most residues, which are in contact with ligands in the known trpb <dig> structure, were strictly conserved among all trpb <dig> and trpb <dig> sequences. the only exception is residue c <dig>  which is v <dig> in trpb2_a sequences. the active site residues h <dig>  k <dig>  and s <dig> were strictly conserved, whereas active site residue k <dig> was conserved only in trpb <dig> proteins and active site residue d <dig>  was an arginine in trpb <dig>  several residues of the interface regions, adjacent to active sites and near sites interacting with ligands had a bimodal occurrence pattern distinguishing trpb <dig> and trpb <dig>  among these were residues  <dig> and  <dig>  which were strictly conserved tryptophan residues in all trpb <dig> proteins. given its position near the gene start, w <dig> may assume a function in translation control. w <dig> succeeds a cluster of strictly conserved residues suggesting a role in stability or protein function.

frequency of trp codons in trpb genes
it has been postulated that the avoidance of tryptophan residues in enzymes for tryptophan synthesis provides a selective advantage  <cit>  as has been shown for a number of amino acid biosynthetic enzymes  <cit> . this criterion was also applied to the trpb genes by assessing the frequency of tryptophan codons . trpb <dig> genes contained one or two tryptophan codons with a mean value of  <dig>  both for s <dig>  s <dig>  and i1_o <dig> species. trpb <dig> genes contained two tryptophan codons or more with a mean of  <dig>  for s <dig> species, and  <dig>  for i2_o <dig> species. most pronounced was the difference for i1_o <dig> species. here, trpb <dig> genes had a mean of  <dig> , whereas trpb <dig> genes had a mean of  <dig>  tryptophan codons. these trpb <dig> genes showed a habitat-specific imbalance of tryptophan codon occurrence with one in mesophilic species and at least two tryptophan codons in hyperthermophiles. in summary and according to the notion of tryptophan codon avoidance, trpb <dig> genes are less optimised than trpb <dig> genes.

the composition of archeal trp gene clusters
the evolution of individual genes and operon formation proceed in parallel. for the combined analysis of both processes, gene orders of relevant archeal and some bacterial trp operons were determined and plotted in figure  <dig>  in most operons, the gene orders trpba and trpeg, respectively, were conserved; however, the arrangement of the linkage groups varied. figure  <dig> is organised as six panels a – f. panel a depicts the trp clusters of thermoplasmataceae, which are of type trpa2dfegc; trpb <dig> lies isolated. in sulfolobaceae and p. torridus , trpb <dig> is the first gene of the gene cluster trpb2adfegc, which matches the above trpa2dfegc in all positions following trpb <dig>  panel c gives the gene clusters of a. pernix and p. aerophilum, which possess a trpb2_i and a trpb2_o gene. in the genome of a. pernix, two linkage groups trpa2b2fc and trpdeg occur; p. aerophilum possesses the cluster trpb2dega <dig>  panel d lists archeal genomes containing linkage groups trpcb1a <dig> and trpdfeg. in methanosarcina mazei, these genes form a single cluster, resulting in trpcb1a1dfeg. in n. pharaonis, these groups are separated by more than 69kb. in panel e, operons are listed where trpb <dig> lies close to the 3'-terminal end. for thermococcus kodakaraensis, methanococcus maripaludis, archaeoglobus fulgidus and pyrococcus abyssi, gene order is trpcdegfb1a <dig>  the gene orders in panel e resemble bacterial operons; two representative examples are plotted in panel f.

it has been argued that simple trp clusters may have been unstable until the complexity of regulation and the foundation of a metabolic theme had reached a certain level  <cit> . gene clusters observed in s <dig> and i2_o <dig> species can be considered the less evolved stages of cluster organisation; compare panels a – c. moreover, the only archeal trp gene regulatory systems identified so far are part of the trp operons of m. thermoautotrophicus  <cit>  and t. kodakaraensis  <cit> , which both have a bacterial-like composition.

besides nanoarchaeum equitans, thermoplasmata  possess the smallest archeal genomes sequenced so far. most plausibly, strong selective pressure associated with the colonised habitat enforces the minimisation of genome size. however, both thermoplasma species possess the gene cluster trpa2dfegc. therefore, the need for tryptophan synthesis can be taken for granted. the separation of trpb <dig> from the remaining trp genes is consistent with a demand for individual gene regulation and expression presumably due to an additional function of trpb <dig>  most plausibly, under these constraints, trpb <dig> is the more optimal variant, which is in a specific environment favoured over trpb <dig> 

what is the origin of trpb genes?
recently, trpa, tmari_i1b and tmari_o2b of t. maritima have been produced in e. coli, purified, and characterised  <cit> . it has been shown that recombinant trpa forms an α-monomer, and that both recombinant trpb proteins form β2-homodimers. however, only the operon-encoded tmari_i1b – but not tmari_o2b – associated with trpa to constitute the conventional αββα tryptophan synthase complex in which both subunits reciprocally activate each other. an analogous experiment has been carried out for genes of s. solfataricus  <cit> . the results have shown that ssolfa_i2c – but not ssolfa_o2c – associates transiently with trpa during catalysis to form a functional tryptophan synthase complex. however, in contrast to regular tryptophan synthases, the affinity between the two subunit-types was weak, and activation has been unidirectional from ssulfo_i2c to trpa. these results indicate the following ranking for the binding-affinity to trpa: trpb2_o < trpb2_i < trpb <dig> 

in the course of modelling trpb evolution, the relationship between the trpb variants has to be made plausible. a possible explanation for the existence of two trpb variants would be convergent evolution, i.e. the independent development of trpb <dig> and trpb <dig> towards a trpb gene. in this case, few residues, which are critical for function, should correspond. however, one would expect these residues embedded into polypeptides, which are relatively dissimilar on the sequence level. in contrast, comparison of trpb <dig> and trpb <dig> sequences shows that on average 30% of the residues are identical and 40% are similar; compare table  <dig>  this finding and the conservation of indels makes convergent evolution highly improbable and argues for a common origin of trpb <dig> and trpb <dig> genes.

the most-widely accepted model for the evolution of novel protein functions postulates gene duplication and the generation of a redundant gene copy  <cit> . it is assumed that evolutionary stress for a copy is largely reduced thus facilitating the evolution of a paralogue with a novel function. this model is based on the notion that negative trade-offs dominate evolutionary processes  <cit> . according to this model of evolution, one of the trpb genes originates from a copy of the ancestral variant. which of the two existing variants represents the more ancient gene? the arguments listed below suggest that trpb <dig> is the ancestral trpb gene.

i) trpb <dig> is not universally distributed among archaea. crenarchaeota possess exclusively trpb <dig> genes. ii) a low frequency of amino acids in enzymes required for their synthesis provides selective advantage  <cit> . in general, trpb <dig> genes contain fewer tryptophan codons than trpb <dig> genes; in i1_o <dig> species, the ratio is  <dig> / <dig>  i.e. less than  <dig> . therefore, trpb <dig> is the more evolved gene. iii) the sophisticated inter-subunit communication suggests that the products of trpb <dig> and trpa <dig> of species-types s <dig> or i1_o <dig> are the most efficient enzymes; see  <cit>  and references therein. hence, trpb <dig> is the more optimised and later evolved trpb variant. iv) it has been postulated that ancient enzymes possess broad specificities  <cit> . the occurrence of trpb <dig> outside trp operons argues for either a new function or a broader specificity. in summary, it is plausible to regard trpb <dig> as representing the more ancient variant of trpb.

modelling the evolution of trpb
in order to reduce the number of possible alternative scenarios that have to be discussed for modelling the evolution of trpb, the following assumptions were made:

i) for bacteria, an ancestral trp operon of type trpegdcfb1a <dig> is most likely  <cit> . therefore, the existence of a trpb <dig> gene in the bacterial predecessor was taken for granted. in addition, it has been concluded for bacterial trp operons that horizontal gene transfer  did not affect the path of evolutionary history  <cit> .

ii) trpb <dig>  trpb <dig>  trpa <dig> and trpa <dig> have been invented only once. the analysis of multiple sequence alignments  shows that the main differences distinguishing the variants are conserved indels. it has been convincingly argued that conserved indels result less likely than e.g. point mutations from independent mutational events and provide useful milestones for the identification of evolutionary phases  <cit> . in addition, the strong coherence seen in the trpb subtree argues against an independent evolution occurring in parallel for bacteria and archaea. due to the existence of conserved indels, an evolutionary process trpb2_i → trpb <dig> → trpb2_o or vice versa is unlikely too.

iii) as has been deduced previously  <cit> , the following order of importance was taken for the processes of genome evolution: gene loss > gene genesis > gene duplication > hgt.

iv) the integration of a trpb gene into the trp operon  was rated less probable than other translocations, gene duplications, gene loss, and mutations. it is presumably very rare that a particular gene gets integrated into a specific gene cluster  <cit> , which is the trp operon in the considered case.

v) it is unlikely that several recent events of hgt explain the taxonomically widespread occurrence of trpb <dig> genes in bacteria. in bacteria, trpb <dig> genes were found in hyperthermophilic  and mesophilic bacteria belonging to the taxonomical groups of alpha- and gammaproteobacteria and bacteroides. the program sigi  <cit>  identifies genomic islands, i.e. gene clusters having a conspicuous codon usage indicating recent hgt events. in none of the considered genomes were trpb <dig> or trpb <dig> genes  elements of such islands.

in order to model the evolution of tryptophan synthase, a phylogenetic tree based on archeal 16s rrna sequence comparisons was plotted according to fig.  <dig> from  <cit> . all considered species and their species-types were added. using the above premises, the most plausible sequence-types of predecessors were determined. these types and evolutionary events needed to infer the modern species-types from the predecessors were added to the tree; see figure  <dig> 

the most plausible predecessor of all crenarchaeota is of type i2_o2; for bacteria and for euryarchaeota it is of type i1_o <dig>  assuming this and excluding thermoplasmata , of the  <dig> modern archeal species,  <dig> have the same species-type as their ancestor. of the  <dig> species possessing a deviating type,  <dig> can be explained with a single gene loss, and for only  <dig> modern species a more complicated genomic rearrangement has to be postulated: loss of trpb <dig> and dislocation of trpb <dig> has to be postulated for m. kandleri , which is a s <dig> species. the replacement of trpb2_o with a copy of trpb <dig> is necessary to explain the i1_o <dig> genome of n. pharaonis. the only euryarcheal class requiring a more complex explanation than gene loss and translocation subsumes thermoplasmata, which possess exclusively trpb <dig> and trpa <dig> genes. the composition of congruency groups  makes a common evolution with sulfolobales or the acquisition of the same trp genes probable. the similarity of operon structures supports this assumption: operon structures of p. torridus and sulfolobales are identical . for t. acidophilum, a large amount of hgt with s. solfataricus, which is found in the same habitat, has been made plausible  <cit> . in summary, a common evolutionary history of trpb <dig> and trpa <dig> genes of sulfolobales and thermoplasmata is highly plausible, proposing for both taxonomical classes an ancestor of species-type i2_o <dig>  assuming an i2_o <dig> ancestor, gene loss is sufficient to explain the genome composition of all modern thermoplasmata.

based on these predecessors, three alternatives explaining the evolution and distribution of trpb species starting from the last universal common ancestor  of bacteria and archaea were deduced . in the following paragraph, the plausibility of these alternatives will be discussed. the rest of this paragraph is used to elucidate the three alternatives.

in panel a of figure  <dig>  the existence of an ancestral trpb*, an intermediate of trpb <dig> and trpb <dig> was postulated for the luca. trpb* might then have diverged into a bacterial trpb <dig> and an archeal trpb <dig> variant. to explain the existence of a non operon-based trpb <dig> in archaea, a duplication of trpb <dig> is necessary. the advent of an euryarcheal i1_o <dig> predecessor requires the replacement of linkage group trpb2a <dig> with trpb1a <dig> via hgt from bacteria to archaea. the occurrence of trpb <dig> in bacterial genomes demands an early transfer of trpb <dig> from an archeal to a bacterial predecessor.

panel b of figure  <dig> depicts an alternative model for the evolution of the luca towards the bacterial and archeal ancestors. as introduced above, gene duplication is regarded the first step for evolving a novel gene function. in addition, trpb <dig> must be considered to represent the more ancient variant of trpb. therefore, the evolution towards the luca of bacteria and archaea is most plausibly explained by the duplication of a non operon-based trpb <dig> gene, which was subsequently integrated into the trp operon and constituted an ancient linkage group trpb2a <dig>  this makes a common ancestor of type i2_o <dig> plausible. these considerations are the basis for further reconstructing the evolution of predecessors. in panels b and c, two alternatives are given.

in panel b, it is assumed that the luca was of type i2_o <dig> and that the evolution trpb <dig> → trpb <dig> occurred in an early bacterial species. in this case, species-types of the luca and the crenarcheal predecessor are identical. to explain the advent of an euryarcheal predecessor of type i1_o <dig>  an ancient event of hgt from bacteria to archaea has to be postulated for the acquisition of the linkage group trpb1a <dig>  which replaced trpb2a <dig> 

in panel c, it is assumed that the luca was of type i1_o <dig>  i.e. the evolution trpb <dig> → trpb <dig> occurred earlier than the speciation of bacteria and archaea. in this case, the species-types of the luca and the predecessors of bacteria and euryarchaeota are identical. however, a replacement of trpb2_i by trpb2_o is necessary to constitute the crenarcheal predecessor.

how plausible are these three models?
model a requires at least two ancient events of hgt to explain the occurrence of trpb <dig> in bacteria and of trpa1b <dig> in euryarchaeota. the phenomenon of non-orthologous displacement in situ is well-characterised  <cit> . in addition to hgt, a duplication of the trpb <dig> gene is needed for the predecessor of archaea. this model is not the most parsimonious one: model b demands only one hgt event, the ancient acquisition of the linkage group trpb1a <dig> by an euryarcheal predecessor.

model c postulates a luca of species-type i1_o <dig>  the sophisticated inter-subunit communication clearly suggests that products of trpb <dig> and trpa <dig> genes are the most specialised and most recently evolved tryptophan synthases; see  <cit>  and references therein. thus, the replacement of trpb <dig> with trpb <dig>  which is needed to explain the existence of a crenarcheal predecessor of type i2_o <dig>  would – with respect to protein-protein interaction – lead to a less optimal tryptophan synthase. this seems unlikely, if one presumes the sustained need for tryptophan synthesis in crenarchaeota.

in contrast, model b postulates the replacement of a  trpb2_i by a trpb <dig> for the euryarcheal predecessor and does not require the replacement of a trpb <dig> by a trpb <dig> for the crenarcheal predecessor. the case of thermoplasmata makes clear that in a thermophilic or hyperthermophilic environment trpb <dig> and trpa <dig> genes are favoured over trpb <dig> and trpa <dig>  there is evidence that the luca was a thermophilic or hyperthermophilic species  <cit> . therefore, it is more probable to expect a luca of species-type i2_o <dig>  in summary, considering parsimony arguments and the assumption that negative trade-offs dominate evolutionary processes  <cit> , model b is the likelier one. figure  <dig> summarises the most parsimonious scenario explaining the composition of modern archeal trp operons: assuming that the luca was of type i2_o <dig>  and that trpb <dig> was a bacterial invention, besides gene loss, which is a frequent evolutionary event, two cases of ancient hgt are sufficient to explain the distribution of trpa and trpb species in current archeal genomes.

CONCLUSIONS
in archeal genomes, various stages of trpb function have been conserved. most plausibly, trpb <dig> represents the ancestral variant of trpb genes. with respect to trpa/trpb communication and cooperativity, the situation observed in s <dig> species  is probably the least complex one. similarly archaic are the non operon-based trpb <dig> genes of sulfolobaceae, whereas the operon-based trpb genes are more evolved. s <dig> and i1_o <dig> species possess highly cooperative synthases. thus, the archeal tryptophan synthase  constitutes a model system for the study of protein complex formation. due to different environmental conditions, several stages of cooperativity have been conserved, which allow to characterise the progress of trpa – trpb coevolution based on gene expression and on functional cooperativity.
