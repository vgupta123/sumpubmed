BACKGROUND
cxcr <dig> is a seven transmembrane g-protein coupled receptor  for the elr + cxcl <dig>  chemokine that transduces pro-angiogenic and pro-inflammatory responses in endothelial and immune cells  <cit> – <cit> . indeed, il-8/cxcr <dig> signaling axis plays multiple functions in the course of physiological and pathological neo-vessel formation. likewise, il- <dig> signaling is instrumental in leukocyte migration  <cit> . notably, it does so by stimulating endothelial cell proliferation, permeability, and migration, and by attracting lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils to perivascular regions. for instance, we recently demonstrated that il- <dig> operates through cxcr <dig> and phosphoinositide 3-kinase γ  to promote angiogenesis and macrophage accumulation in retina, while curbing the endothelial barrier function  <cit> . importantly, interfering with this pathway quelled laser-induced vascular dysfunctions in mouse retina. similar observations were done in the context of cancers, including malignant brain tumors, prostate tumors, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, chemically induced-skin tumors, ras-mediated tumors and inflammation-driven tumors  <cit> , <cit> – <cit> . these data place cxcr <dig> as a promising pharmacological target in many human diseases and pathological conditions  <cit> . in that view, targeting gpcr constitutes the primary option for pharmacological intervention and drug development  <cit> . however, many of these compounds act as direct antagonists leaving uncertain their ability to target pathways that are aberrantly and/or constitutively active.

physiologically, gpcr signaling can be either twisted or interrupted by intracellular cascades implying endocytosis and ubiquitination  <cit> . similarly to the cxcl <dig>  chemokine receptor cxcr <dig>  ligand-activated cxcr <dig> undergoes endocytosis in clathrin-coated vesicles  <cit> , <cit> . in that view, the viral cxcr <dig> homolog vgpcr from the kaposi sarcoma herpes virus, harbors a consensus adaptin  <dig>  binding motif in its c-terminal tail, which drives its constitutive shuttling in clathrin-coated vesicles, and further adjusts its signaling activity  <cit> . moreover, cxcr <dig> internalization might involve scaffold proteins, including β-arrestins, ap <dig>  actin-binding proteins and yet to be determined pdz ligand motif binding proteins  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> – <cit> . however, how exactly cxcr <dig> signaling, intracellular sorting and ubiquitination are coordinated is not fully elucidated. this prompted us to explore the molecular contribution of lysine residues, operating as ubiquitin acceptors, to cxcr <dig> activity.

RESULTS
the ligation of g-protein coupled receptor cxcr <dig> drives its relocation into endosomal compartments, where it could be targeted for lysosomal degradation  <cit> . this dynamic process has been shown to rely on specific motifs, including lysine residues within the c-terminal domain  <cit> . to investigate which lysine could contribute to the fine-tuning of cxcr <dig> trafficking, we first proceed to amino-acid sequence alignment between residues  <dig> and  <dig> on the human sequence. our in silico analysis identified two lysine residues on position  <dig> and  <dig> in the human sequence, conserved in pig, mouse, and chicken, and shared between cxcr <dig> and cxcr <dig> . as expected, structural prediction did not reveal major changes in the overall cxcr <dig> molecular organization in the context of k-r mutations . point mutation in each of these two lysines was thus engineered on the full-length  receptor, harboring an au <dig> tag. the expression of k327r  and k337r  fl cxcr <dig> mutants was found similar to the one of wild type  when transfected in hek-293t cells . these constructs have been thus used throughout the study. because lysine residues functions as ubiquitin-acceptors, we next setup the experimental conditions to visualize cxcr <dig> ubiquitination, using validated methods for intracellular targets  <cit> , <cit> . cxcr <dig> immunoprecipitated fractions were analyzed under denaturing conditions, ie 1% sds final concentration to prevent non-covalent protein interactions but without heat denaturation that could favor membrane protein aggregation. using these conditions, the monoclonal anti-ubiquitin antibody  readily detected modified cxcr <dig> in the high molecular-weight fraction . additionally, denaturation prior immunoprecipitation dissociated putative contaminations with associated ubiquitinated partners of cxcr <dig>  such as β-arrestins . similarly, ubiquitination addition was detected in the cxcr <dig> immunoprecipitated fractions from endothelial cells that endogenously expressed the receptor . as a further control, cxcr <dig> antagonist sb <dig>  <cit> , <cit>  was sufficient to curtail cxcr <dig> ubiquitination in response to il- <dig> . of note, cxcr <dig> ubiquitination species accumulated in cells pretreated with the proteasome inhibitor mg <dig>  suggesting that ubiquitination marks cxcr <dig> for degradation . we next examine the ubiquitination profile of k-r cxcr <dig> mutants. interestingly, the typical ubiquitination ladder discerned in response to il- <dig> challenge in wt cxcr2-expressing hek-293t cells was profoundly reduced when k <dig> residue was substituted for an arginine . our data thus suggest that the k <dig> residue is critical for k-linked ubiquitination of activated cxcr <dig> 

we next aimed at understanding how k <dig> could modulate cxcr <dig> trafficking. in this scenario, localization of k-r cxcr <dig> mutants was further characterized by confocal microscopy . in starved non-stimulated hek-293t cells, wt cxcr <dig> primarily labeled plasma membrane and redistributed in internal vesicle-like dots shortly following il- <dig> challenge . by contrast, k327r cxcr <dig> remained accumulated at the plasma membrane regardless of il- <dig> treatment. on the other hand, the k337r mutant mimicked wt cxcr <dig>  as it shuttled from the plasma membrane to internal vesicles . this was found similar to endogenous cxcr <dig> dynamics in il-8-challenged thp <dig> monocytes . likewise, cxcr <dig> internalization, as monitored through antibody uptake assay followed by an acid wash, was enhanced in response to il- <dig> administration, unless k <dig> was mutated . co-labeling with rab <dig> and ap <dig>  which illuminates late and early endosomes, respectively, indeed supports the notion that wt and k337r cxcr <dig> were endocytosed upon il- <dig> stimulation . conversely, plasma membrane staining of the k327r mutant was not curbed by il- <dig> treatment, unlike wt and k337r mutant . altogether, our results show that the k327r point mutation is sufficient to restrain cxcr <dig> internalization upon ligand binding, suggesting therefore that this residue is critical to ensure proper trafficking of the activated receptor.

we next investigated whether k <dig> residue participates to cxcr <dig> signaling ability. to this aim, one of the most proximal events in gpcr activation, namely β-arrestin <dig> activation was first assessed. interestingly, k327r single substitution prevented from il-8-induced β-arrestin <dig> clustering, observed normally in cells transfected with wt and k337r cxcr <dig> . likewise, k327r cxcr <dig> mutant less efficiently activated β-arrestin <dig> in response to il- <dig>  as estimated through bioluminescence resonance energy transfer  technology . as phosphorylation is also an important hallmark of gpcr activation upon ligation  <cit> , we checked the status of cxcr <dig> tyrosine phosphorylation in immunoprecipitation experiments . as expected, il- <dig> drove wt cxcr <dig> phosphorylation. in sharp contrast, the signal was barely detectable when k327r mutant was ectopically expressed in hek-293t . secondly, intracellular signaling, namely extracellular regulated kinase 1/ <dig>  phosphorylation and increase in calcium influx, was evaluated in wt, k327r and k337r cxcr <dig> expressing hek-293t cells . our data showed that il- <dig> could not elicit either cxcr <dig> and erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation, or the elevation in intracellular calcium concentration in k327r cxcr2-transfected cells. furthermore, luciferase-based reporter assays unveiled that k <dig> mutation abrogates ap <dig> and nf-κb activation downstream of cxcr <dig> stimulation by il- <dig> . thus, our data demonstrate that the signaling function of cxcr <dig> is compromised when the k <dig> residue is not available for ubiquitination.

CONCLUSIONS
we report here that the conserved k <dig> residue on cxcr <dig> is a key ubiquitin acceptor upon il- <dig> challenge in ectopic cell models. of note, interfering with this post-translational modification abrogates cxcr <dig> trafficking and signaling. in this scenario, cxcr <dig> poly-ubiquitination, by a yet to be determined ligase, precedes β-arrestin <dig> recruitment and cxcr <dig> internalization, and is therefore placed upstream in the il-8-mediated intracellular signaling cascade. our data thus highlight an original option to specifically and finely tune cxcr <dig> signaling in pathological situations, where aberrantly elevated, such as tumor angiogenesis and inflammation.
