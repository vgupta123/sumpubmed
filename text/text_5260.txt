BACKGROUND
the bacterial cell wall resists intracellular pressure and gives the bacterium its particular shape. cell wall reinforcement is brought about by a strong scaffolding structure, the peptidoglycan, which is formed by glycan strands and peptide chains held together by covalent bonds, resulting in a mono- or multilayered network. the glycan strands are composed of n-acetylglucosamine  and n-acetylmuramyl  residues linked together by β- <dig>  glycosidic bonds. peptides are covalently attached to the lactyl group of the muramic acid and their cross-linking results in the net structure of the peptidoglycan .

peptidoglycan is synthesized in a multi-stage process. the first steps occur in the cytoplasm, where a set of enzymatic reactions gives rise to the assembly of the murnac-pentapeptide. this unit is in turn linked to the carrier undecaprenol lipid via a pyrophosphate group; afterwards the glcnac group is added, generating the lipid ii precursor. the saccharidic and peptidic moieties of lipid ii are subsequently exposed to the periplasmic space. at this stage, peptidoglycan biosynthesis involves polymerization of the glycan chains, catalyzed by glycosyltransferases  <cit>  as well as interpeptide bridge formation performed by transpeptidases  <cit> . these two enzymatic reactions are resident on the extracellular domains of penicillin-binding proteins  which are membrane-associated molecules, present in all eubacteria  <cit> .

peptidoglycan metabolism is a dynamic process since this structure grows and divides in perfect synchronization with cell growth and division. furthermore, it is well established that peptidoglycan is subject to maturation, turnover and recycling in gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . to fullfil these processes, it is expected that peptidoglycan cleavage enzymes must exert their functions in coordinated action with pbps. indeed, a large range of different peptidoglycan hydrolases have been identified in numerous bacterial species and specific peptidoglycan hydrolases exist for almost each covalent bond  <cit>  . the polysaccharidic component of peptidoglycan is the target of several hydrolases: the β- <dig>  glycosidic bond between murnac and glcnac residues is cleaved by lyzosyme and by lytic transglycosylases , the β- <dig>  glycosidic bond between glcnac and murnac is hydrolyzed by glucosaminidases and amidases are responsible for the cleavage of the murnac-l-alanine bond .

lyzosyme and lt enzymes cleave the same β- <dig> -murnac-glcnac bond but generate different reaction products: while lyzosymes catalyze a hydrolytic reaction, lts cleave the β-glycosidic linkage with the concomitant formation of  <dig> -anhydromuramyl residues, blocking the reducing end of the glycan strands. the significance of the ring structure is not known but it has been speculated that the bond energy may be utilized for glycan strand rearrangements. in addition, the  <dig> -anhydro ring may also be considered as a specific product of peptidoglycan turnover. despite the lack of understanding of the physiological function of anhydromuropeptide product, lt enzymes must play a significant cellular role. indeed, it has been observed that deletions of genes encoding lt proteins lead to e. coli and neisseria meningitidis with altered cell separation phenotypes, indicating that lts cleave septal peptidoglycan  <cit> . macromolecular transport systems  of gram-negative bacteria contain lt enzymes, suggesting that peptidoglycan hole formation  is specifically performed by this enzyme family  <cit> . as mentioned above, the enlargement of the bacterial stress-bearing peptidoglycan structure requires the well coordinated action of synthases  and hydrolase enzymes. the "three-for-one" growth mechanism described by höltje proposes that a triplet of glycan strands cross-linked to each other  is attached to the peptidoglycan layer. subsequently, the docking strand is removed by hydrolases resulting in the insertion of the peptidoglycan triplet. the hydrolases involved in such multienzyme complexes are endopeptidases and lt enzymes  <cit> . this hypothesis is supported by experimental data as lt and pbps could be co-purified from e. coli extracts  <cit> . in conclusion, lt enzymes play an important cellular role in diverse aspects of cell biology as expected from their presence in a very wide range of eubacteria as well as archaebacteria  <cit> .

surprinsingly, no such lt enzyme has been identified to date in the human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae, the causative agent of ear infections in children, as well as meningitis and pneumonia. the pattern of peptidoglycan hydrolases in this gram-positive bacteria includes, besides a d, d-carboxypeptidase, five glycan strand cleaving enzymes . four of these are surface-exposed proteins harboring choline-binding domains which are non-covalently bound to choline residues present on cell wall pneumococcal teichoic and lipoteichoic acids  <cit> . the choline-binding proteins  catalyzing peptidoglycan hydrolysis are lyta, lytb, lytc and potentially cbpd . lyta is an amidase and also appears as an autolytic enzyme, causing bacteriolysis when acting in an uncontrolled manner  <cit> . lytb is a glucosaminidase involved in cell separation as lytb mutants form very long chains of over  <dig> cells  <cit> . lytc is a lysozyme with an autolytic behavior at 30°c  <cit> . finally, cbpd and pcsb contain a chap domain  predicted to hydrolyse the peptidoglycan in pneumococcus, but definitive biochemical data are still lacking  <cit> .

our interest in the biology of s. pneumoniae led us to investigate the presence of lt enzymes in this bacteria. homology searches of enzyme sequences within the pneumococcus genome using bioinformatics tools allowed the identification of a new domain harboring motifs that infer potential peptidoglycan cleavage activity. for this reason we named this domain pecace . this domain sequence was found exclusively in gram-positive bacterial species, suggesting a significant cellular role. finally, the pecace domain is in some instances found in association with other domains, known to catalyze peptidoglycan hydrolysis: this observation reinforces the predicted function of pecace as participating in peptidoglycan cleavage and represents another example of multifunctional proteins involved in peptidoglycan metabolism.

RESULTS
identification of a protein harboring the pecace domain in s. pneumoniae
the c-terminal domain of escherichia coli slt <dig>  has a lysozyme-like fold and its amino acid sequence was employed in a search of bacilli genomes within the ncbi conserved domain search server  <cit> . thirty-four slt70-homologue sequences were retrieved using an inclusion threshold of  <dig> . none of these sequence originated from the s. pneumoniae translated genome. subsequently, each of these  <dig> sequences was compared with the non-redundant protein database using psi-blast with a e-value threshold of  <dig>  and  <dig> sequences showed significant matches with a unique protein in s. pneumoniae. this sequence  contains  <dig> amino acids: the first  <dig> amino acids are predicted to form a transmembrane anchor and the subsequent 192-residue region is putatively exposed to the extracellular space . this s. pneumoniae np <dig> sequence has been tested as a pneumococcal vaccine antigen on the basis of preliminary screens for novel vaccine candidates  <cit> .

a three-dimensional fold prediction of the s. pneumoniae np <dig> protein was performed with the 3d-pssm server  <cit>  which identified two matches: e. coli slt <dig>  and lysg . the sequence alignment between np <dig> and slt <dig> is shown in fig.  <dig>  defining the pecace domain in the pneumococcal protein. the secondary structures are also reported, based on three-dimensional structures of slt <dig> and on computational predictions for pecace and suggest that the latter is highly α-helical . it is of note that both slt <dig> and lysg are highly similar, and both lack the catalytic aspartate residue commonly found in the active site of lysozymes  <cit> . therefore, the pecace domain of the np <dig> sequence appears to belong to this group of bacterial lysozymes, characterized by the absence of an aspartate residue in the catalytic site and is part of the glycoside hydrolase family  <dig> based upon cazy classification . the catalytic acid residue in the pecace domain is most probably glu <dig> since it aligns with the catalytic glu <dig> residue in the slt <dig> sequence . the serine residue following the catalytic glutamate and the glmqi/v motif are essential for active-site architecture and are conserved between slt <dig> and lysg. in the pecace sequence, a threonine residue follows the catalytic glutamate and the glmqi/v motif differs since the corresponding sequence is dvmqs . finally, the second motif aynxg which has been shown to be involved in the interaction with the substrate for slt <dig>  is well conserved in the pecace sequence .

based on this sequence analysis, we infer that the s. pneumoniae np <dig> protein, through its pecace domain, probably catalyzes the peptidoglycan cleavage of the β- <dig> -murnac-glcnac bond by employing glu <dig> as the catalytic residue.

identification of the pecace domain in gram-positive bacteria
the  <dig> amino acid sequence from s. pneumoniae np <dig>  containing the pecace domain, was used as a psi-blast search query. in total,  <dig> distinct proteins, all from gram-positive bacteria, were identified  and no sequences from gram-negative bacteria were retrieved. these sequences were aligned with clustalw and manually edited. a conserved pattern could be extracted from this alignment: e- -x-g-x-d-x-m-q- - -e-  which was used to search for additional sequences, but no new sequence could be detected from databases, even with a degenerated pattern. psi-blast performed through the gold server led to the identification of  <dig> new sequences from gram-positive bacteria  <cit> . in summary, out of the about  <dig> gram-positive bacteria for which the whole genome sequence is available,  <dig> of them contain at least one protein harboring the pecace domain. the final alignment of these sequences with the s. pneumoniae pecace domain is shown in fig.  <dig>  the putative catalytic glutamate residue, glu <dig> in the s. pneumoniae pecace domain, is conserved in all sequences and the following residue is a ser or thr in accordance with slt <dig> and lysg patterns. in addition, the dvmqs motif in the s. pneumoniae pecace domain is also well represented in the large majority of sequences with the consensus sequence di/vmqsses. finally, the second motif aynxg is also conserved while the ala residue is often replaced by a ser. in conclusion, the features identified in the s. pneumoniae pecace domain regarding the potential enzymatic properties of peptidoglycan polysaccharide cleavage are also shared by the similar pecace domains in gram-positive bacteria.

genomic organization of pecace genes
the genomic organization of pecace genes has been analyzed in a variety of gram-positive bacteria and a conserved distribution was observed in various streptococci species . this feature indicates that genetic transfer of the whole cluster may have occured within the streptococci family, providing further evidence regarding the significant importance of the pecace domains in bacterial physiology. however, the pneumococcal cluster is more related to the s. mitis one than to s. mutans, s. agalactiae and s. pyogenes ones, while clusters of the latter three species are related to each other. genes located upstream and downstream of pecace are in some instances well characterized but the function of the corresponding proteins could not bring any clues about the role of pecace, nor any evidence on pecace gene transcription. however, pecace is in all cases found in association with the same gene  but no information about the function of the protein encoded by this locus is available in databases. transcriptional analysis of these two genes may bring informations about their potential co-regulation, a first stage in deciphering cellular function.

domain organization of proteins containing the pecace domain
the pecace domain is found in a large range of protein architectures, commonly associated with other peptidoglycan hydrolases, suggesting that these proteins have multiple peptidoglycan cleavages activities . the identification of proteins displaying the pecace domain was carried out using ncbi conserved domain search and pfam servers. in addition, prediction of membrane anchoring was performed with the das-transmembrane prediction server while extracellular secretion of the protein was deduced from the identification of a signal peptide.

pecace-containing proteins appear to fall into  <dig> main categories :  those which display no additional domain,  chap-nlpc/p <dig> as the associated group,  chap-nlpc/p <dig> and an unknown domain as associated groups,  domains with no ascribed functions and finally  chap-nlpc/p <dig> and m <dig> peptidase as associated groups.

the  <dig> proteins which contain only the pecace domain belong to group  and harbor either a signal peptide or a transmembrane helix , leading in both cases to cell surface expression.

the chap-nlpc/p <dig> domain is commonly associated with the pecace domain in different modular organizations, namely in groups , , and   <cit> . the chap domain has been recently described as a cysteine, histidine-dependent amidohydrolase/peptidase and it has been proposed to hydrolyse peptidoglycan containing γ-glutamyl  <cit> . indeed, proteins such as n-acetylmuramyl-l-alanine amidase and d-alanyl-glycyl endopeptidase have been described as chap-containing enzymes  <cit> . however, while the substrate and the reaction mechanism have not been yet experimentally characterized for the chap domain, its role in peptidoglycan hydrolysis is inferred from its presence in multifunctional proteins recognizing peptidoglycan as substrate. recently, hydrolytic activity of peptidoglycan has been attributed to the chap-containing protein pcsb in s. pneumoniae due to abnormal and uncontrolled cell wall synthesis at misplaced septa and formation of long cells in pcsb deleted mutant strains  <cit> . proteins from group  are expressed at the cell surface through a transmembrane anchor or are secreted,  <dig> members have been identified with this topology. only one sequence  from enterococcus faecalis bm <dig> is part of the group , and no function could be identified for the n-terminus domain preceding the pecace domain. however the former domain is lys-rich  suggesting an electrostatic interaction with the peptidoglycan as proposed for b. subtilis endopeptidase  <cit> . group  is composed of an unique sequence from b. cereus atcc  <dig> . neither a signal peptide nor a transmembrane anchor have been detected. furthermore, the domain of unknown function, which is different from the ones identified in groups  and  is present in other multimodular proteins of b. cereus, in association with peptidoglycan hydrolysis enzymes. finally, two sequences share the architecture defining the group  which harbor chap-nlpc/p <dig> and peptidase m <dig> domains  <cit> . members of the peptidase m <dig> family are generally glycylglycine endo-metallopeptidases; the archetypal member is the lysostaphin enzyme from staphylococcus species which cleaves the pentaglycine bridge in the peptidoglycan  <cit> . one group  protein  is encoded by bacillus anthracis plasmid pxo <dig> and is required for synthesis of various anthrax toxin proteins  <cit> ; this sequence has neither a signal peptide nor a transmembrane region. the second sequence of group  is located on bacillus cereus atcc  <dig> plasmid pbc <dig>  and contains, in addition to chap-nlpc/p <dig>  peptidase m <dig> and pecace domain as well as an extra sequence to which no function has been attributed but with significant similarity with a b. anthracis plasmid pxo <dig> sequence   <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, a new domain named pecace, putatively involved in peptidoglycan cleavage has been identified in s. pneumoniae. the probable enzymatic activity deduced from the detailed analysis of the amino acid sequence suggests a lt-type or goose lyzosyme-type mechanism; we are currently characterising the enzymatic properties and cellular role of the pecace domain from s. pneumoniae. this new putative pneumococcal peptidoglycan cleavage enzyme differs largely from the other hydrolases already identified in this bacteria. indeed, lyta, lytb, lytc and cbpd proteins are all bound to the cell wall choline residues and thus expressed at the cell surface. the presence of a signal peptide within the amino acid sequence of pcsb suggests that it is either exposed on the cell surface or secreted. on the contrary, the pneumococcal np <dig> protein displaying the pecace domain is embeded in the cytoplasmic membrane by a hydrophobic helix. the physiological role of this membranous peptidoglycan cleavage enzyme might differ from the other peptidoglycan hydrolysing enzymes.

interestingly, the pecace domain has only been found in gram-positive bacteria. it is tempting to speculate that the multilayered structure of gram-positive peptidoglycan relates to the pecace putative activity.

the architecture of multimodular proteins containing the pecace domain is another example of the pattern of multiple activities harbored by many peptidoglycan hydrolases, probably needed for the regulation of peptidoglycan metabolism. the release of new bacterial genomes sequences will probably add new members that will complete the five groups identified so far in this work and new groups could also emerge. conversely, the functional characterization of the unknown domains mentioned in this work should now be easier, as their substrate, the peptidoglycan, is now identified.
