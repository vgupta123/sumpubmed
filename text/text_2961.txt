BACKGROUND
silkworm, a model for lepidoptera, is a holometabolous insect whose developmental stages include egg, five larval instars, pupa, and adult. during molting and metamorphosis, conspicuous and relatively abrupt changes are seen in its cuticle. insect cuticle is mainly composed of chitin nanofibres embedded in a matrix of cuticular proteins. in procuticle, a grouping of what has been called the exo- and endocuticle, cuticular proteins bound to chitin and cross-linked with the sclerotizing agents form one of the most infrangible known biological coverings  <cit> . generally, cuticle plays essential roles in many physiological functions to protect the insect's body from dehydration, the invasion of pathogens, the penetration of insecticides, and physical injury  <cit> .

as an important component of cuticle, hundreds of cuticular protein sequences have been identified in over  <dig> species of insects  <cit> . many conserved motifs were identified in this data including r&r consensus  <cit> , cpf&cpfl  <cit> , tweedle  <cit> , and others. among them, the cuticular protein sequences containing r&r consensus  were extensively studied in anopheles gambiae, drosophila melanogaster, bombyx mori, and apis mellifera by the annotation of genomic data  <cit> . togawa and coworkers subsequently examined the expression profile of  <dig> cpr genes in a. gambiae by real-time rt-pcr and found that most of them were expressed at single or multiple periods associated with molting  <cit> .

our bioinformatic analysis and previous work of others have identified more than two hundred cuticular protein genes in the silkworm genome  <cit> , indicating that the silkworm employs more than  <dig> % of its estimated protein-coding genes to encode cuticular proteins. these observations led us to focus on the following three questions: 1) how many genes including cuticular protein genes are expressed in silkworm epidermal tissues? 2) is the expression of a special set of cuticular protein genes metamorphic stage-specific? and 3) are cuticular protein genes coordinately regulated? the sequencing of the silkworm genome along with microarray technology offered us an opportunity to investigate gene expression profiles on a large scale to answer these questions. eleven developmental stages were selected, which ranged from day  <dig> of the fourth instar larva to day  <dig> of pupa, and microarray-based expression profile analysis of all detectable genes in silkworm epidermal tissues was performed. our data showed that a total of  <dig> genes including the vast majority of silkworm cuticular protein genes were activated in selected stages, with no correlation between expression patterns and the presence of conserved motifs. in addition, twenty-six cpr protein genes distributed on chromosome  <dig> were co-expressed in larval and wandering stages and three common elements were identified in the  <dig> kb upstream region of these co-expressed cpr genes.

RESULTS
developmental expression profile of genes in epidermal tissues
in silkworm, oligonucleotide microarrays were employed to examine gene expression profiles of ten tissues on day  <dig> of the fifth instar larval stage, as reported by xia et al.  <cit> . the microarray contained  <dig>  70-mer oligonucleotides covering all predicted genes derived from the first draft silkworm genome sequence database  <cit> . thereafter, the silkworm genomic database was updated and information refreshed  <cit> , and one hundred and forty-seven additional oligonucleotide probes were designed for previously unpredicted genes. the current oligonucleotide microarray contained  <dig>  probes, and the complete set of raw and normalized data from this study has been deposited in the gene expression omnibus  repository . we investigated the developmental expression profile of genes in epidermal tissues using the updated microarrays. a total of  <dig>  genes were transcribed in at least one selected stage in which clean cuticle tissues were easily isolated. as shown in figure  <dig>  the clustering analysis was carried out to analyze the expression profile. from the heat map of hierarchical clustering , we found that the selected  <dig> stages were clustered into two groups. group i contained five stages including v <dig>  v <dig>  w <dig>  w <dig>  and p <dig>  the remaining six stages, iv <dig>  ivm, w <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  and p <dig> fell into group ii. stages v <dig>  w <dig>  and w <dig> of group i were closely clustered into one subgroup, indicating that genes shared a similar expression profile in epidermal tissues in these stages. by contrast, stages v <dig> and p <dig> were separated, indicating they had different gene expression profiles from one another which were distinct from the other in group i stages. unlike group i, group ii was further divided into two subgroups, one consisting of stages of iv <dig> and ivm and the other a tight cluster of stages w <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  and p <dig> 

to determine the significance of the expression profiles, k-means clustering was performed , resulting in  <dig> genes divided into three clusters. clusters i and iii comprised  <dig> genes and  <dig> genes, respectively. cluster ii, the smaller one, contained  <dig> genes. it is worthwhile to mention that genes in the three clusters showed distinctly different expression patterns. genes in cluster i were highly expressed at stages of w <dig>  p <dig>  and p <dig>  whereas genes in cluster ii were highly expressed at iv <dig>  ivm, and p <dig>  genes in both clusters i and ii showed low expression level at stages of v <dig>  w <dig>  and w <dig>  in contrast, genes in cluster iii had higher expression levels at those stages.

diverse expression patterns indicated genes of these three clusters might be involved in distinct functions and physiological pathways. therefore, gene ontology  annotations were determined for genes in the three clusters . as shown in the go map, genes in all clusters were mainly involved in four categories including binding, catalytic, structural molecule, and transporter activity. nucleic acid binding, protein binding, and ion binding functions were predominated in the binding category. in the catalytic category, a large number of genes were expressed to produce three kinds of enzymes including oxidoreductases, transferases, and hydrolases. furthermore, most of the transporters were transmembrane transporters with substrate-specific transporter activities. cuticular protein genes and ribosomal genes were predominant in the structural molecule category. significant differences were observed in the clustering of genes among several go categories. for instance, the cuticular protein genes showed a different distribution in the three clusters, with the majority found in cluster i instead of clusters ii and iii. moreover, molecular transducers that function in signal transduction were mainly contained in clusters i and ii. by contrast, more of the nucleic acid binding associated genes were expressed like the pattern shown in cluster iii. the go annotation of  <dig> genes is provided in additional file  <dig> 

up-regulated and down-regulated genes in epidermal tissues from two stages before ecdysis
to understand better what happens in cuticles when the silkworm initiates a molting cycle, we analyzed the gene expression ratios of ivm to iv <dig> and w <dig> to w <dig>  trying to find genes with significant expression changes. the cut-off values were set at a ratio of more than  <dig> or less than  <dig> , which represents up- and down- regulated expression, respectively. as shown in additional file  <dig>  the expression of ninety-four genes appeared to be more than 4-fold higher in the two molting phases. in this up-regulated gene list, we found sixty-eight cuticular protein genes, four juvenile hormone binding protein genes, two putative genes encoding ecdysteroid regulated proteins, six neuropeptide-like binding protein genes, and two genes related to sclerotization. in contrast, only two genes, sp <dig> and chitinase-related protein  <dig>  were identified with 4-fold less abundant transcripts.

two hundred and twenty-seven cuticular protein genes were expressed
the genome sequencing project for b. mori was completed by chinese and japanese groups in  <dig>  <cit> . we identified  <dig> putative cuticular protein genes in an updated silkworm genome database including  <dig> cpr genes,  <dig> tweedle genes,  <dig> cpf genes,  <dig> cpfl genes,  <dig> cpg genes, and  <dig> cph genes. among them, two hundred and twenty-one genes were reported in a previous study  <cit> , the corresponding accession numbers are listed in additional file  <dig>  oligonucleotide probes were designed for all except six of the cuticular protein genes, these were bmorcpr <dig> , bmorcpr <dig> , bmorcpg <dig> , bmorcpg <dig> , bmorcpg <dig> , and bmorcph <dig> . in addition, members of three pairs of genes, namely bmorcpr <dig>  and bmorcpr <dig> , bmorcpr <dig>  and bmorcpr <dig> , and bmorcpr <dig>  and bmorcpr <dig> , shared high similarity in the open reading frame  region, and no unique probes were to distinguish them. similarly, a single probe was designed to represent three genes, bmorcpg <dig> , bmorcpg <dig> , and bmorcpg <dig> , which shared high identity. in all we obtained  <dig> oligonucleotide probes representing  <dig> cuticular protein genes. according to the microarray data, as shown in figure  <dig>  the expression signals of  <dig> cuticular protein genes were detected in at least one stage.

developmental expression profiles of cuticular protein genes
hierarchical clustering  by both samples and genes was performed to examine the expression profiles of cuticular protein genes. the heat map of hierarchical clustering placed  <dig> developmental stages into two groups. eight stages, i <dig>  iii <dig>  iv <dig>  v <dig>  v <dig>  w <dig>  w <dig>  and p <dig> were clustered into group i; the remaining stages were in group ii. a marked boundary was observed between the two groups. genes in group i and group ii displayed distinctly different expression profiles. many more cuticular protein genes were expressed in stages which were clustered in group ii than in group i. k-means clustering performed to determine the expression patterns of cuticular protein genes yielded five gene clusters with distinct expression patterns, as shown in figure 3b. cuticular protein genes contained in cluster a were widely expressed among all  <dig> developmental stages. clusters d and e comprised some larval- and pupal- specific expressed cuticular protein genes. among them, bmorcpr <dig> was only expressed at four stages including i <dig>  iii <dig>  ivm, and v <dig>  the northern blot data for this gene  showed a similar expression pattern at stages i <dig>  iii <dig>  and ivm, whereas a weak signal was detected at stage v <dig>  based on the microarray data, bmorcpr <dig> was identified as a pupal-specific cuticular protein gene expressed at stage p <dig>  the northern blot data  indicated that except for p <dig>  it was also expressed at a lower level at stages p <dig>  p <dig>  and p <dig>  in clusters b and c, the cuticular protein genes showed a noticeable coordinate expression pattern. however, genes in cluster c had lower expression levels in pupal stages than those in cluster b. although well organized expression patterns were shown in clusters b and c, exceptions were still found at several stages.

in silkworm, cuticular protein genes are divided into five families based on conserved motifs. to understand better the expression profiles of cuticular protein genes bearing particular motifs, the number of genes in each cluster and the families to which they belong were summarized. as shown in table  <dig>  each cluster consisted of more than two families.  <dig> %  rr- <dig> cuticular protein genes were placed into clusters a, b, and e. among them, 26%  rr- <dig> genes found in cluster a were widely expressed in all tested stages. in contrast, a total of  <dig>  rr- <dig> genes were found in clusters b, c, d, and e. only  <dig>  rr- <dig> genes were identified in cluster a. rr- <dig> genes were found in clusters a and e. three of four tweedle cuticular protein genes shared the same expression pattern as cluster b and only one  was found in cluster a with a wide expression pattern. a cpf gene was identified in silkworm but its expression level was too low to be detected. four cpfl genes were found in clusters a, b, and c. for low complexity cuticular protein genes,  <dig> cpgs and  <dig> cphs were found in cluster a. altogether, cluster a contained mainly rr- <dig>  cpg, and cph genes, whereas majority of genes in clusters b and c were rr- <dig> and rr- <dig> genes.

*there is a group of genes  where there was only indirect evidence that they coded for possible cuticular proteins.

twenty-six rr genes distributed in chromosome  <dig> were strictly co-expressed in larval and wandering molting stages
silkworm cuticular protein genes showed differential patterns of expression, and no obvious correlation was found between expression patterns and the presence of conserved motifs. however, as visualized in the heat map of k-means clustering , cuticular protein genes in clusters b and c exhibited distinctive expression pattern. genes in cluster b had abundant transcripts not only in molting stages but also throughout the four pupal stages. the same expression pattern was found for genes in cluster c from stages i <dig> to w <dig>  but, the number of cuticular protein genes expressed in pupal stages in cluster c appeared to be lower than in cluster b. considering their similar patterns of expression in larval and wandering stages, we combined the  <dig> cuticular protein genes in cluster b with the  <dig> cuticular protein genes in cluster c for the subsequent analysis. first the chromosomal locations of these  <dig> cuticular protein genes were examined. as shown in figure  <dig>   <dig> %  of these genes were distributed in chromosome  <dig>  including  <dig> rr- <dig> and  <dig> rr- <dig> genes. stringent qt  clustering algorithm analysis and manual verification were carried out to analyze the expression profiles of these  <dig> rr cuticular protein genes. twenty-six of these  <dig> genes, as shown in figure  <dig>  were strictly expressed in larval molting stages and in pharate pupae. no expression signals were detected in stages i <dig>  iii <dig>  iv <dig>  and v <dig> to w <dig>  such result was also supported by the northern hybridization. as shown in figure 4c, the microarray-based expression profile of bmorcpr <dig>  one of these  <dig> rr genes, was completely consistent with the results of the northern blots.

upstream promoter regions of the twenty-six rr genes shared common putative regulatory elements
as noted above, the twenty-six rr cuticular protein genes distributed in chromosome  <dig> were co-expressed along the larval and wandering stages. to understand the underlying mechanisms of these consistent expression profiles, we analyzed the transcriptional regulatory regions located  <dig> kb upstream of the putative transcription start sites in the twenty-six genes. the meme algorithm, which was used to discover similar sequence elements in the promoter regions, identified three putative regulatory elements shared by the  <dig> rr genes . elements i, ii, and iii  contained  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> nucleotides, respectively. tomtom motif comparison tool was employed to compare these three elements with the known motifs. no motifs were found in element ii . only one nkx2- <dig> transcription factor binding site was found in the middle of element i . nine transcriptional factor binding sites including hb, cdx, nkx6- <dig>  br-c z <dig>  br-c z <dig>  plzf, hnf <dig>  foxp <dig>  and tcf showed similarity with element iii . the alignment match logos for elements i and iii are illustrated in additional file  <dig>  in addition, fimo  was applied to determine whether the elements identified in this study were present in the upstream regions of the cuticular protein genes in anopheles gambiae  <cit> . homologues of element ii were found upstream of four cpr genes . notably, element iii was found in the upstream sequences of  <dig> cuticular protein genes, of which  <dig> members were cpr genes of a. gambiae .

the tess  server was employed to seek known binding sites for transcription factors from the transfac database in these  <dig> kb upstream regions  <cit> . in all the twenty-six upstream sequences, binding sites for at least one of the multiple isoforms of the broad complex and ftz-f <dig> were found. a binding site for the insect ecdysone receptor ecr was also found in the upstream regions of all genes except bmorcpr <dig>  in addition, a binding site for the transcription factor e74a was found in the upstream regions of  <dig> of the  <dig> cuticular protein genes. two members of the pou family, oct- <dig> and sgf, had binding sites in the upstream regions of  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively. nkx2- <dig>  foxhead, c/ebp, bzip and bhlh had binding sites in the upstream regions of all  <dig> rr cuticular protein genes. and binding sites for at least one of the four sgf isoforms were found. the search results also revealed binding sites for b-factor, dfd, eve, gata, hb, hmg, pax, prd, sox isoforms, tbp, tll, twi, ubx, zen, zeste, ap- <dig>  bcd, and gaga in the majority of the upstream sequences of these  <dig> cuticular protein.

discussion
cuticle is generally considered as a protective cover for insects  <cit> . a sclerotized and tanned integument layer consisting of chitin and particular cuticular proteins synthesized and secreted by the epidermal cells play vital roles in insects' lives  <cit> . in the present study, we monitored gene expression profiles of silkworm epidermal tissues isolated from eleven developmental stages ranging from day  <dig> of fourth instar larvae to day  <dig> pupae. in these stages, the expression of  <dig> genes was detected. this represents the first global gene expression analysis of lepidoptera insect epidermal tissues, which provides important functional insight.

chitin and cuticular proteins are the major components of insect cuticle  <cit> . it is noteworthy to mention that the gene coding for chitin synthase, a critical enzyme for chitin synthesis  <cit> , had peak expressions at the same stages in which the majority of cuticular protein genes were also highly expressed, indicating that the processes of cuticle formation were activated concurrently. our analysis detected the expressions of seven yellow protein genes, several of which are involved in cuticle pigmentation  <cit> . furthermore, two well-studied melanin syntheses related genes tyrosine hydroxylase  and dopa decarboxylase   <cit> , were strongly induced when molting was initiated. these results suggested that many genes involved in cuticle tanning were activated in epidermal tissues before ecdysis. in addition, four juvenile hormone binding protein genes  and two ecdysteroid regulated proteins  were highly expressed before molting. previous studies showed that jhbps protect juvenile hormone from degradation  <cit> , and the mrna of manduca sexta erp <dig>  a homolog of erp, is abundant in epidermal tissues during molting  <cit> . although the functions of these genes have not yet been clarified, it can be assumed that jhbps and erps are involved in the molting process. the expression of six neuropeptide-like protein genes  was also stimulated prior to molting. in silkworm, est evidences showed that neuropeptide-like protein genes were present in epidermis, but their functions were unclear. we speculate that these nplps might participate in the regulation of molting. in contrast to numerous up-regulated genes, only two down-regulated genes were detected. sp <dig> is considered as a storage protein in hemolymph and ovary associated with the development of lepidoptera insects  <cit> . another down-regulated gene, chitinase-related protein  <dig> showed high identity to chitinase. however, without a glutamate residue in the catalytic sites chitinase-related protein  <dig> did not hydrolyze chitin  <cit> .

the results of the go analysis presented in figure  <dig> showed that genes expressed in epidermal tissues were involved in different pathways, which indicated that cuticle functions not only as a protective cover against external threats but also as a place for active metabolism. in our data, the expressions of silkworm chitinase and genes related to the degradation of proteins were detected. moreover, numerous transporter genes were expressed in epidermal tissues. one of the conclusions made from these observations was that the synthesis of new cuticle was concomitant with the degradation of the old cuticle. interestingly, the majority of heat shock protein genes of silkworm were expressed in epidermal tissues throughout the developmental stages, suggesting their role as molecular chaperone was necessary for synthesis and degradation of epidermal proteins  <cit> .

silkworm is a holometabolous insect that develops from larva to pupa, and then pupa to adult. in order to grow and change the appearance, it must molt and cast its old cuticles. so, during molting and metamorphosis dramatic changes occur in cuticles. as the major component of cuticle, cuticular proteins are obvious choices for studying development and metamorphosis. here, the expressions of cuticular protein genes at  <dig> stages ranging from day  <dig> of the first instar larvae to day  <dig> of pupae were investigated. of the  <dig> available probes for cuticular protein gene,  <dig> genes  had expression signals and were distributed in diverse gene expression patterns. one of goals of this research was to learn which families of cuticular protein genes were expressed in each metamorphic stage. our data clearly showed no correlation between the expression profiles of cuticular protein genes and the presence of conserved motifs. this result is consistent with what togawa et al found in the expression profile of putative cpr cuticular protein genes of a. gambiae by qrt-pcr  <cit> . on the other hand, our data explicitly revealed massive expression of many cuticular protein genes at molting stages, when the silkworm was building its cuticle. a reasonable explanation for this observation is that these cuticular protein genes were transcribed and immediately translated to proteins participating in the construction of cuticles. okamoto and colleagues reported that massive numbers of ests for bmorcpr <dig>  bmorcpr <dig> and bmorcpg <dig> were only isolated during the fourth larval molt, whereas more ests of bmorcpr <dig> and bmorcpr <dig> genes were identified in the intermolt stage  <cit> . in our microarray, bmorcpr <dig>  bmorcpr <dig>  bmorcpr <dig>  and bmorcpr <dig> showed similar patterns to the okamoto et al.'s  <cit> . however, bmorcpg <dig> showed a high level at both molting and intermolt stages in our data, which was somewhat different from the patterns of okamoto et al. this can be explained by the differences in sensitivity between est sequencing and microarrays. our data also revealed that although the cuticles of silkworm larva, pupa, and adult were distinct, a number of cuticular protein genes were commonly expressed at all stages, indicating that the properties of cuticle depend on the amount of cuticular proteins, and their spatial distribution, the degree of sclerotization and tanning  <cit> , rather than simply the types of cuticular proteins present.

the silkworm used more than  <dig> % of its total estimated genes to encode the cuticular proteins, and at each molting stage massive cuticular protein genes were activated. another goal of this research was to learn how the silkworm regulates the transcription of cuticular protein genes. coordinate regulation using the same conserved motifs or localizing genes on the same chromosomes might be the simplest and most efficient mechanism. our data revealed no evidence for coordinate regulation in the majority of cuticular protein genes. however, twenty-six rr cuticular protein genes co-expressed in larval stages were found to be distributed in chromosome  <dig>  togawa and colleagues also found that a portion of a. gambiae cuticular protein genes distributed in a narrow chromosome region showed highly similar expression patterns  <cit> . three similar elements were further identified in the  <dig> kb upstream promoter regions of the  <dig> silkworm cuticular genes on chromosome  <dig>  notably, the similar sequences of element ii and iii were found in the upstream regions of a. gambiae cpr genes, and a binding site of transcriptional factor nkx2- <dig> was identified in the middle of element. nkx2- <dig> acts cooperatively with pax <dig>  whose function was conserved from invertebrate to vertebrate for dorsal and ventral patterning  <cit> . a recent study showed that broad-complex and βftz-f <dig> positively regulated the transcription of wing cuticular protein gene in silkworm  <cit> . interestingly, element iii found in the present study was much longer than the binding sequence of any broad complex isoform. the three elements might account for the coordinate regulation of the  <dig> cuticular protein genes. future analysis of these elements will increase the understanding of transcriptional regulation of cuticular protein genes.

besides, many binding sites for known transcription factors were identified in the upstream regions of these cuticular protein genes. binding sites for ecr and e74a were discovered in the upstream regions of  <dig>  and  <dig> of the  <dig> cuticular protein genes, respectively. ecr formed heterodimer with usp  to function as the receptor of ecdysone and e74a was known as the early genes induced by ecdysone and functioned as one of ecdysone signal transducers  <cit> . binding sites for bzip, bhlh, and c/ebp were discovered in upstream sequences of all  <dig> cuticular protein genes. previous study showed that transcription factors with bzip and bhlh domain played roles in transcriptional regulation of neuropeptides and peptide hormone  <cit> , which were engaged in the regulation of insect molting. c/ebp was the factor bound to the promoters of silkworm chorion genes and regulated their precise spatial and temporal expression  <cit> . in silkworm, pou factors played a critical role in transcriptional regulation of neuropeptides and silk genes  <cit> .

generally, the expression of cuticular protein genes is regulated by two hormones, ecdysone and juvenile hormone. ecdysone induces the transcription of the primary-response genes  <cit> , including broad complex genes, e <dig> isoforms, βftz-f <dig>  and orphan nuclear receptors. primary-response genes activate and regulate the transcription of the secondary-response target genes. although a number of juvenile hormone binding proteins have been identified  <cit> , little was known about the juvenile hormone receptor. cuticular protein genes are usually considered to be located downstream of the hormones action hierarchy  <cit> . the transcription of cuticular protein genes could be activated by various signaling pathways, which provides a possible explanation for the diverse expression patterns demonstrated in this study.

CONCLUSIONS
this study describes the expression profile of genes in silkworm epidermal tissues for the first time. microarray data showed activation of a total of  <dig> genes involved in various functions and physiological pathways. more than 93% cuticular protein genes were expressed in selected developmental stages, displaying diverse expression patterns. the majority of cuticle proteins showed no evidence of coordinate regulation as a function of common cuticle protein motifs. however,  <dig> rr genes distributed in chromosome  <dig> were co-expressed at larval and wandering stages, and three putative elements were identified in the  <dig> kb upstream region of these  <dig> rr genes. extensive expression data and the analysis of transcriptional factor binding sites provided novel insights into the functional coordination of these genes.
