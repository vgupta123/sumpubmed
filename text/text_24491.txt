BACKGROUND
during embryonic development, the spatio-temporal expression of transcriptional regulators and morphogenetic signals is tightly controlled. in fact, different types of congenital malformations are caused by mutations affecting specific cis-regulatory and non-coding genomic regions that alter the expression of genes or gene clusters in specific tissues . genome-wide functional mapping revealed many of the large genomic landscapes that control the expression of developmental regulator genes in a global and tissue-specific manner
 <cit> . this study and others reveal that the cis-regulatory regions controlling gene expression in a particular tissue are often located several hundred kilobases  or even megabases  up- or downstream of the transcriptional start sites in other loci, and may control the expression of several genes
 <cit> . recently, it has been shown how multiple cis-regulatory regions interact to control the expression of the 5’hoxd gene complex in the presumptive digit territory. the transcriptionally active part of the 5’hoxd gene cluster forms a so-called regulatory archipelago in which dispersed cis-regulatory elements co-operate to control gene expression in the distal limb bud by interacting with proximal promoters over large distances
 <cit> . in fact, regulatory landscapes with distant and dispersed cis-regulatory regions seem to be a recurring theme in the dynamic spatio-temporal regulation of genes that are essential for limb bud development .

vertebrate limb bud development is controlled by interactions between two main signalling centres, the apical ectodermal ridge  and the zone of polarizing activity  located in the posterior limb mesenchyme. these two signalling centres interact as part of a self-regulatory feedback signalling system involving several signalling pathways
 <cit> . in particular, zpa cells produce the sonic hedgehog  signal, which together with gremlin1-mediated antagonism of bone morphogenetic proteins  in the posterior-distal limb bud mesenchyme propagates fibroblast growth factor  signalling in the aer
 <cit> . this shh/grem1/aer-fgf feedback-signalling loop promotes distal progression of limb bud outgrowth and formation of the autopod which gives rise to carpals and digit rays . shh expression in the posterior limb bud mesenchyme is controlled by a cis-regulatory region located about 800 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site. deletion of this zpa regulatory region  results in loss of distal limb structures
 <cit> , while point mutations within the zrs result in anterior ectopic shh expression and duplications of the thumb and/or anterior digits in different species
 <cit> . in cells actively transcribing shh, the zrs loops out of its chromosomal territory to the shh transcription unit, which reveals how distant cis-regulatory elements control gene expression
 <cit> . recently, several transcriptional regulators have been identified that control shh expression by directly interacting with the distant zrs region. these include hox proteins, the bhlh transcription factor hand <dig>  and ets transcription factors, providing a glimpse of the complex transcriptional regulation of shh in the posterior limb bud mesenchyme
 <cit> .

shh signalling is transduced by the gli family of transcriptional regulators and inhibits the constitutive processing of the full-length gli <dig> activator to its repressor form gli3r . of the three gli transcription factors expressed during limb bud development, only gli <dig> is essential on its own . the inactivation of gli <dig> alters morphogenetic feedback signalling and results in formation of additional anterior digits
 <cit> . in particular, gli <dig> restrains the proliferation of mesenchymal progenitors in the anterior limb bud mesenchyme and promotes initiation of digit ray chondrogenesis by directly repressing grem <dig> expression during handplate formation
 <cit> .

we have previously shown that the expression of grem <dig> in the limb bud mesenchyme is controlled by a large genomic landscape downstream of its transcription unit
 <cit> . in fact, several of the classical limb deformity mutations that disrupt distal limb bud development and formation of metanephric kidneys in the mouse are caused by deletions affecting this cis-regulatory landscape rather than directly altering the grem <dig> gene products
 <cit> . molecular and genetic analysis in the mouse identified a 70 kb genomic region located downstream of the grem <dig> transcription unit within the neighbouring formin <dig>  gene that is required for grem <dig> expression in the limb bud mesenchyme
 <cit> . detailed analysis of this grem <dig> genomic landscape revealed similarities with the global control region  that controls the expression of 5’hoxd genes in the limb bud mesenchyme
 <cit> , but did not reveal the structural nature and transacting factors and/or signalling pathways controlling these cis-regulatory regions.

to gain further insights into the grem <dig> landscape, the potential cis-regulatory activities of the three highest evolutionarily conserved genomic regions within the 70 kb grem <dig> critical region were analysed. in addition to its expression in the posterior mesenchyme, emphasis was also given to the coordinated distal-anterior expansion of grem <dig> expression, which is key to orderly progression of limb bud development
 <cit> . combining bac with conventional transgenic approaches, we identified a 9 kb genomic region that is able to recapitulate major but not all aspects of the dynamic spatio-temporal grem <dig> expression in the limb bud mesenchyme. this 9 kb region was termed grem <dig> regulatory sequence  <dig> , and contains a core sequence that is essential to express a lacz transgene under control of a ß-globin minimal promoter in a grem1-like pattern. the grs <dig> region drives gene expression into the posterior and subsequently distal-anterior mesenchyme, i.e. reproduces aspects of the distal-anterior expansion of grem <dig> expression during progression of limb bud development. by crossing grs <dig> transgenic mice into different mutant contexts, we establish that the grs <dig> region is controlled by inputs from both the shh and bmp signalling pathways in limb buds. in addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation  shows that gli <dig> interacts with the conserved hmco <dig> sequences in the grs <dig> region. the functionally relevant cis-regulatory regions identified by the present and two previous studies
 <cit>  map to the endogenous dnase i hypersensitive sites within the grem <dig> genomic landscape recently identified by the encode consortium
 <cit> . this indicates that the grem <dig> cis-regulatory landscape is composed of at least five active cis-regulatory regions that control the spatio-temporal expression of grem <dig> in mouse embryos and limb buds.

RESULTS
identification of conserved limb bud regulatory regions within the grem <dig> genomic landscape
using functional genetics in the mouse, we previously identified a ~70 kb region located downstream of grem <dig> that is required for its expression in the limb bud mesenchyme . this limb bud cis-regulatory region is located between coding exons  <dig> and  <dig> of the neighbouring fmn <dig> gene. the evolutionary conserved regions  genome browser  was used for multiple sequence alignments to compare the mouse genome with different mammalian and the chicken genomes. this analysis revealed several blocks of highly conserved sequences among mammalian species, but only three of them were also highly conserved in the chicken and termed hmco <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . the most conserved parts of these three hmco core regions are ~80% identical . of these three regions only hmco <dig> is also present in the orthologous genomic region in frogs , which express grem <dig> during limb bud development
 <cit> . despite the fact that grem <dig> is expressed during fin bud development
 <cit> , no hmco homologies are present in the zebrafish genome . clustalw <dig> alignments  of the fmn1grem <dig> regions from different species revealed the absence of hmco homologies in other ray-finned fish species such as fugu and medaka . in contrast, all three hmco regions are present in the genome of coelacanth, a lobe-finned fish closely related to tetrapods 
 <cit> . as the grem <dig> and fmn <dig> loci are linked in all species analysed , the distance between the orthologous fmn <dig> coding exon  <dig>  and grem <dig> coding exon  <dig> was determined. during evolution, this distance increased as it is smallest in the genomes of ray finned fishes and at least ~10-fold larger in tetrapods and coelacanth . in addition, the distance between fmn <dig> exon  <dig>  and exon  <dig> correlates well with the presence or absence of the three hmco regions . in ray-finned fishes and frogs , the distance is ~3-7 kb, while in mammals and coelacanth it ranges from ~50-70 kb. thus, the increase of intronic and intergenic regions in the fmn1-grem <dig> landscape correlates well with appearance of the three hmco regions during vertebrate evolution. 
 <cit>  using the ecr browser with the mouse genome release  <dig>  as reference genome. the critical genomic region on mouse chromosome  <dig> is shown in centromeric  to telomeric  orientation and is located downstream of the grem <dig> coding exons. as the critical genomic region is part of the fmn <dig> locus, the interspersed fmn <dig> coding exons are indicated as open boxes in the scheme. three blocks of highly conserved non-coding sequences were identified  and are indicated in blue. conserved coding regions are indicated in black and non-coding regions conserved ≥74% over ≥100 bp are coloured salmon. the peak detected in the region of hmco <dig> in the zebrafish genome corresponds to fmn <dig> exon  <dig>  regions consisting of repetitive sequences are shown in green .  conserved linkage between the grem <dig> and fmn <dig> loci in vertebrates. increased intergenic distances correlate with the presence of hmco regions in tetrapods and coelacanth in contrast to ray-finned fishes. the phylogenetic tree analysis was done with the ucsc multiple alignment functions to align the 3' part of the fmn <dig> locus and the grem <dig> locus from different species. open boxes represent the orthologous fmn <dig> coding exons  <dig> and  <dig>  black box represents grem <dig> coding exon  <dig>  the intergenic distances between fmn <dig> orthologous exon  <dig> and grem <dig> coding exon  <dig> are indicated to the right of the scheme. ensembl genomes used for alignment: mouse: m. musculus ; human: h. sapiens ; chimpanzee: p. troglodytes ; dog: c. familiaris ; bovine: b. taurus ; opossum: m. domestica ; chicken: g. gallus ; lizard: a. carolinensis ; frog: x. tropicalis ; coelacanth: l. chalumnae ; fugu: t. rubripes ; medaka: o. latipes ; zebrafish: d. rerio .

to determine the requirement of each of these three hmco regions for grem <dig> expression in mouse limb buds, we used a bac-based strategy in combination with analysis of transgenic founder embryos . a 250 kb mouse genomic bac encoding the critical region and the grem <dig> transcription unit was used to fuse the lacz gene in frame with the grem <dig> orf
 <cit> . we assessed the expression of the lacz reporter transgene by analysing the spatio-temporal distribution of ß-galactosidase activity . expression of the grem1-lacz fusion protein in the forelimb bud mesenchyme was detected in a posterior-distal domain , mimicking the early endogenous grem <dig> expression rather accurately. therefore, the grem1-lacz bac construct was used to engineer deletions of the three hmco regions and determine their requirement for grem1-lacz expression in the posterior mesenchyme. to control for reproducible generation of expressing bac transgenic founder embryos, the grem1-lacz bac  was injected in parallel to the bacs with engineered deletions . while the control grem1-lacz bac was always robustly expressed in the posterior mesenchyme , deletion of the 520 bp hmco <dig> core region resulted in complete loss of lacz expression from limb buds . in contrast, deletion of the 1279 bp hmco <dig> core region only caused partial loss of lacz expression from the posterior limb bud mesenchyme . lacz remained expressed normally in the majority of founder embryos carrying a 924 bp deletion of the hmco <dig> region . taken together, this bac transgenic analysis establishes hmco <dig> as most critical for grem <dig> expression in the posterior-distal limb bud mesenchyme. as the hmco <dig> core region is highly conserved in tetrapods and lobe-finned fish but not ray-finned fish , it likely represents a cis-regulatory region important to tetrapod evolution. the other two hmco regions might contribute to robust expression of grem1lacz in the posterior mesenchyme, as in particular the deletion of hmco <dig> results in significantly reduced lacz expression . 

in an attempt to gain further insight into the enhancer potential and possible interactions of hmco2/ <dig> with hmco <dig>  conventional transgenic approaches using a minimal human ß-globin promoter  were employed. however, neither individual hmco regions  nor in a combination of all three was able to drive robust expression of the ßglob-lacz transgene in the posterior limb bud mesenchyme . expression of the ßglob-lacz transgene under control of all three hmco core regions resulted in scattered lacz positive cells in the anterior-distal mesenchyme of forelimb buds . in contrast, the transgene was strongly expressed in the posterior embryo including hindlimb buds . these results show that a transgene consisting of an array of the hmco core regions is unable to drive lacz expression into the posterior forelimb bud mesenchyme. this indicates that additional elements of the grem <dig> genomic landscape are required for grem <dig> expression in limb buds.

next, we assessed to which extent a larger genomic fragment containing hmco <dig> and flanking regions could drive ßglob-lacz expression into the posterior limb bud mesenchyme . analysis of transgenic founder embryos revealed that this transgenic construct drives robust ßglob-lacz expression in the posterior limb bud mesenchyme , strikingly similar to the domain of the parental grem1-lacz bac construct . taken together, these results indicate that this cis-regulatory region enhances grem <dig> expression in the posterior limb bud mesenchyme, which prompted us to term this 9 kb region grem <dig> regulatory sequence  <dig> . grs <dig> encompasses the hmco <dig> region next to fmn <dig> coding exon  <dig> and a further downstream region that is highly conserved in mammals. this region, like hmco <dig> overlaps with a previously identified gli binding region . in addition, two potential gli binding sites were identified by in silico analysis .

spatio-temporal activity of the grs <dig> region during mouse limb bud development
to analyze comparatively the activity of the grs <dig> region with respect to the spatio-temporal regulation of grem <dig> expression, transgenic mouse strains expressing the grs1-ßglob-lacz reporter construct were established . seven transgenic founders were obtained. in three independent strains, lacz was expressed in the posterior fore- and hindlimb bud mesenchyme in a pattern comparable to the transgenic founder embryos . two of these three transgenic strains were analyzed in detail and used to study the spatio-temporal lacz distribution . initial analysis revealed that ß-galactosidase activity of the lacz transgene was detected earlier in one strain and is significantly higher than in the other strain . as levels did not change during subsequent generations , this is likely due to differences in transgene copy number and/or integration site. therefore, the copy number of both strains was determined by real-time qpcr analysis . this analysis revealed that ten copies of the grs1-ßglob-lacz transgene were integrated into the genome of the strain expressing higher lacz levels , while only two copies were detected in the grs1tg <dig> strain . in grs1tg10/+ embryos, ß-galactosidase activity is first detected at ~ e <dig>  in the posterior forelimb bud mesenchyme and continuously increases until ~ e <dig>  . from ~ e <dig>  onwards, scattered positive cells were detected in the anterior mesenchyme, and this anterior expression increased during distal limb bud outgrowth to form a crescent in the distal-anterior autopod . by e <dig> , ß-galactosidase activity was rather variable, such that the anterior crescent separated from the posterior domain in some forelimb buds. in grs1tg2/+ embryos, the spatio-temporal pattern is similar, but expression levels are significantly reduced due to the lower transgene copy number, resulting in detection of ß-galactosidase activity from only ~ e <dig>  onwards . in both strains, grs <dig> drove expression of the ßglob-lacz reporter specifically in the limb bud mesenchyme, despite some low ß-galactosidase activity detected in the developing eyes of grs1tg10/+ transgenic embryos . this analysis reveals the robust nature of the grs <dig> region, which functions in positive regulation of grem <dig> expression in the limb bud mesenchyme. the posterior domain of ß-galactosidase activity at e <dig>   is comparable to the grem <dig> transcript distribution in wild-type limb buds at earlier stages . this temporal delay is likely due to postponed transcriptional activation and/or up-regulation of the grs <dig> transgene as the establishment of a posterior lacz expression domain is also only apparent at e <dig>  in grs1tg10/+ transgenic limb buds . therefore, additional cis-regulatory regions likely control the temporally correct early onset of grem <dig> expression. similar delays in the onset of lacz reporter gene expression have been previously observed by analyzing the zrs cis-regulatory region that controls shh expression in mouse limb buds
 <cit> . during distal progression of limb bud development, endogenous grem <dig> expression expands distal-anterior within the developing handplate and begins to fade by e <dig>  , due to termination of the shh/grem1/aer-fgf feedback loop and gli3-mediated repression in the anterior limb bud mesenchyme
 <cit> . in contrast, ß-galactosidase activity remains high in the posterior limb bud mesenchyme of grs <dig> transgenic embryos and the distal-anterior expansion of its expression is significantly delayed and only occurs as transcription of the endogenous grem <dig> locus is starting to terminate .

grem <dig> expression is restricted to dorsal and ventral limb bud mesenchyme and excluded from the chondrogenic core mesenchyme , which is relevant to bmp-mediated induction of chondrogenesis . furthermore, the lim-homeodomain transcription factors lhx <dig> and lhx <dig> have been implicated in regulating grem <dig> expression predominantly in the ventral limb bud mesenchyme in response to shh signalling
 <cit> . therefore, the extent to which the dorso-ventral transcript distribution is maintained by the grs <dig> transgene was assessed . indeed, the expression of both the high  and low copy transgenes  remained excluded from the core mesenchyme throughout limb bud outgrowth and patterning. similar to grem <dig> transcripts, ß-galactosidase activity is higher dorsally than ventrally . by e <dig> , ß-galactosidase activity expands anteriorly in both the dorsal and ventral mesenchyme , reminiscent of the crescent of grem <dig> transcript , which indicates that the grs <dig> contains cis-regulatory regions controlled by lhx transcription factors
 <cit> . taken together, the results shown in figures 
 <dig> and
 <dig> establish that the 9 kb grs <dig> cis-regulatory region is able to recapitulate major aspects of grem <dig> expression in the limb bud mesenchyme. in particular, the grs <dig> also recapitulates aspects of the distal-anterior expansion of grem <dig> expression in limb buds , which was not observed in previous attempts to identify cis-regulatory regions that control grem <dig> expression in limb buds
 <cit> . the fact that the grs <dig> transgene recapitulates some aspects of this distal-anterior expansion is important, as grem <dig> transcription normally expands anteriorly in register with posterior aer-fgfs and allows propagation of shh/grem1/aer-fgf signalling
 <cit> . however, the delay in activation and lack of termination of the grs <dig> transgene  indicates that other regulatory inputs from the grem <dig> genomic landscape are required to regulate its dynamic expression in mouse limb buds. 

the grs <dig> cis-regulatory region integrates inputs from the shh and bmp signalling pathways
during limb bud initiation, mesenchymal bmp <dig> signal transduction is likely required to activate grem <dig> expression in the posterior mesenchyme, while shh is primarily required for up-regulation and distal-anterior expansion during progression of limb bud development
 <cit> . furthermore, gli <dig> in the anterior mesenchyme and aer-fgf signal transduction are required to restrict and eventually terminate grem <dig> expression 
 <cit> . therefore, grs1tg10/+ embryos lacking key components of both the shh and bmp signalling pathway in their limb buds were generated to gain insight into the possible direct impact of these main signalling pathways on the grs <dig> element . analysis of shhΔ/Δgrs1tg10/+ embryos revealed the complete absence of ß-galactosidase activity in shh-deficient forelimb buds . this contrasts with the endogenous grem <dig> expression, which is activated but not maintained in shh-deficient limb buds
 <cit> . these results show that activation of the grs <dig> region depends on shh signalling, which indicated that it could also participate in ectopic grem <dig> activation due to anterior ectopic shh signalling in mouse
 <cit>  and chicken limb buds
 <cit> . furthermore, gli <dig> proteins interact with specific cis-regulatory regions in the grem <dig> genomic landscape
 <cit>  and genetic analysis has shown that gli <dig> is essential for the spatio-temporally controlled restriction and subsequent termination of grem <dig> expression in the distal anterior mesenchyme
 <cit> . in gli3-deficient grs <dig> transgenic  forelimb buds, ß-galactosidase activity in the posterior limb buds is comparable to grs1tg10/+ limb buds, while expression in the anterior mesenchyme is significantly increased by e <dig>  . this late up-regulation of anterior ß-galactosidase activity indicates that grs <dig> is required for gli3-mediated termination of grem <dig> expression in the anterior limb bud mesenchyme, which is essential for the spatio-temporally correct initiation of mesenchymal condensations and chondrogenic differentiation of anterior digits
 <cit> . 

bmps control grem <dig> activation in the posterior limb bud mesenchyme and directly modulate its expression as part of the self-regulatory shh/grem1/aer-fgf feedback signalling system. therefore, a conditional smad <dig> loss-of-function allele
 <cit>  in combination with the prx1-cre recombinase strain
 <cit>  was used to inactivate smad <dig>  and thereby canonical bmp signal transduction in the limb bud mesenchyme. in smad4Δ/Δm mutant limb buds, endogenous grem <dig> expression is down-regulated but not lost, while shh expression remains . in smad4Δ/Δmgrs1tg10/+ forelimb buds, ß-galactosidase activity appears normal in the posterior mesenchyme, while distal-anterior expansion fails to occur . this indicates that grs <dig> activity is modulated by smad4-mediated signal transduction during the progression of limb bud development. these results indicate that also the distal-anterior expansion of grem <dig> expression depends on bmp activity and agree with the observation that genetic lowering of bmp <dig> results in a global reduction of grem <dig> expression in the limb bud mesenchyme
 <cit> .

finally, in grem1-deficient embryos, bmp activity is increased due to reduced bmp antagonism, which results in up-regulation of non-functional grem <dig> transcript
 <cit> . as bmp signal transduction modulates grs <dig> activity during advanced limb bud development , we also determined the potential influence of grem <dig> deficiency on grs <dig> activity. in grem1Δ/Δgrs1tg10/+ e <dig>  limb buds ß-galactosidase activity is initially similar to grs1tg10/+ limb buds . subsequently, ß-galactosidase activity is increased and by e <dig>  the entire grem1Δ/Δgrs1tg10/+ limb bud is positive . these alterations of ß-galactosidase activity in smad4Δ/Δm and grem1Δ/Δ forelimb buds reveal that grs <dig> activity is extensively modulated by changes in bmp activity, in particular also the anterior expansion of its expression. taken together, this genetic analysis  shows that grs <dig> activity critically depends on shh and is modulated extensively by bmp signal transduction. this analysis identifies the grs <dig>  located ~70 kb downstream of the grem <dig> transcription unit as a cis-regulatory region that integrates inputs by both shh and bmp signal transduction. however, as previous analysis provided good evidence that grem <dig> is activated by mesenchymal bmp signalling upstream of establishing the shh/fgf feedback loop
 <cit> , these studies point to the existence of additional unknown bmp response regions that activate grem <dig> expression in the posterior limb bud mesenchyme.

endogenous gli <dig> proteins are part of the chromatin complexes interacting with specific parts of the grs <dig> region in mouse limb buds
the observed loss of grs <dig> activity in shh-deficient limb buds  indicated that the grs <dig> region could be regulated directly by gli proteins. indeed, two gli binding regions without consensus gli binding motif  were previously mapped to the 9 kb grs <dig> region using transgene-mediated expression of an epitope-tagged gli <dig> transgene in combination with chromatin immunoprecipitation . to study the potential interaction of endogenous gli <dig> proteins with the grs <dig> region in its normal genomic context in wild-type limb buds, chip analyses using antibodies that detect both the gli <dig> activator and repressor protein isoforms were performed
 <cit> . gli <dig> chip using extracts of wild-type and gli3-deficient limb buds at e <dig>  revealed significant enrichment of one specific region within grs <dig> by real-time qpcr analysis . a significant ~4-fold enrichment of an amplicon located within hmco <dig> was observed by comparing wild-type to gli3-deficient limb buds  and to a less conserved region . in contrast, no significant enrichments of the other amplicons located in grs <dig> were detected . as the amplicons located in hmco <dig>  and hmco <dig>  were also not significantly enriched, the gli3-containing chromatin complexes appear to interact rather specifically with a region within the highly conserved hmco <dig> in wild-type limb buds. these results not only corroborates the identity of previously identified gbr1
 <cit> , but indicate that this region mediates the effects of shh signal transduction on grs <dig> activity in the posterior limb bud mesenchyme. 
 <dig>  the potential interaction of endogenous gli <dig> proteins with these critical amplicons was analysed by chip-qpcr analysis of wild-type  and gli3xt/xt  limb buds at e <dig> . two stars indicate significant enrichment of amplicon “d” in the hmco <dig> region .  gli <dig> chip-qpcr analysis of the hmco <dig> region. amplicons “f” and “g” are located inside hmco <dig> and the previously identified gbr3

spatio-temporal grem <dig> expression is regulated by the interaction of multiple cis-regulatory regions far downstream of the transcription unit
previous genetic analysis showed that grem <dig> transcription in limb buds is initiated by bmp signalling and up-regulated under the influence of shh and aer-fgf signaling as limb bud development progresses
 <cit> . finally, grem <dig> expression is terminated concomitantly with the initiation of digit formation by high levels of fgf signal transduction and gli3-mediated repression in the anterior mouse limb bud mesenchyme
 <cit> . this dynamic spatio-temporal regulation of grem <dig> expression indicates that the activity of different cis-regulatory elements may change over time. the spatio-temporal activity of the grs <dig> transgene  indicates that it is primarily regulated by the shh/grem1/aer-fgf feedback signaling system as limb bud development progresses. in particular, its activity is first apparent when the shh/grem1/aer-fgf feedback is already established, and the expected termination does not occur, as ß-galactosidase activity remains in the posterior mesenchyme after the endogenous grem <dig> transcripts have been down-regulated . these results indicate that fgf-mediated termination of grem <dig> expression and the underlying self-regulatory feedback signalling system
 <cit>  does not occur by fgf signal transduction impacting the grs <dig> region. in addition, neither the 70 kb critical region of the grem <dig> landscape  nor transgenes derived from this region  are able to accurately recapitulate the entire spatio-temporal distribution of grem <dig> transcript in the limb bud mesenchyme. therefore, either the interactions among these elements or additional as yet unknown cis-regulatory regions located outside the critical region must also participate in the regulation of grem <dig> expression. indeed, there is circumstantial evidence for the latter, as deletion of the gc-rich fmn <dig> coding exon  <dig>  results in non-complementation with a grem <dig> null allele, causing a hypomorphic grem <dig> limb skeletal phenotype, and significantly reduced grem <dig> expression .

mapping of dnase i hypersensitive  sites is used to identify active regulatory regions in chromatin . recently, the encode consortium has done genome-wide mapping of hs sites in several mouse tissues including limb buds 
 <cit> . interestingly, this analysis revealed three hs sites within the gbrs of the grs <dig> and hmco <dig>  while no hs sites mapping to hmco <dig> were detected in limb buds at e <dig>  . the five hs sites mapped by the encode consortium in the grem <dig> genomic landscape overlap with the cis-regulatory elements required for grem <dig> expression in mouse limb buds . the hs site mapping to hmco <dig> overlaps well with the amplicon enriched by gli3-chip analysis . in fact, all hs sites in the grem <dig> genomic landscape overlap either with the gbr regions interacting with gli3
 <cit>  or ctcf binding sites
 <cit> . analysis of ctcf-deficient limb buds revealed its requirement for up-regulation and distal-anterior expansion of grem <dig> expression
 <cit> . interestingly, the hs site overlapping with gbr4
 <cit>  is not conserved between mammals and birds . while the early gbr <dig> activity is comparable to grs <dig> in the posterior mesenchyme , it does not support distal-anterior expansion of the expression during subsequent development
 <cit> . thus, the interaction of the gbr <dig> and grs <dig> cis-regulatory regions could provide grem <dig> expression with the necessary robustness and evolutionary plasticity, as has been postulated for the transcriptional regulation of hoxd genes by multiple interacting regulatory regions during limb bud development
 <cit> . taken together, these studies establish that the five hs sites in the grem <dig> genomic landscape are functionally relevant for grem <dig> expression in mouse limb buds, but not all of them are evolutionary highly conserved. indeed, experimental and comparative evolutionary evidence indicates that alterations in the spatio-temporal expression of grem <dig>  and thereby the activity of the shh/grem1/aer-fgf feedback loop, likely contributes significantly to variations in digit numbers and morphologies . 
 <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we identify grs <dig> as a distant cis-regulatory region that encompasses the highly conserved hmco <dig> region and show that it controls important aspects of grem <dig> expression in the posterior and distal-anterior limb bud mesenchyme. grs <dig> activity depends critically on shh signalling and endogenous gli <dig> protein complexes interact with specific regions within hmco <dig> in wild-type limb buds. in addition, the anterior expansion of grs <dig> activity is also regulated by bmp signal transduction. these results together with previous studies reveal the large genomic architecture composed of several distant cis-regulatory regions that control the highly dynamic grem <dig> expression in response to signalling inputs from the bmp, shh and fgf pathways. it is likely that the interactions among these dispersed cis-regulatory regions provide the dynamic grem <dig> expression in limb buds with the necessary robustness, but at the same time allow for evolutionary plasticity of its expression
