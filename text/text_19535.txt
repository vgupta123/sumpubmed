BACKGROUND
the atlantic salmon  is a species of worldwide significance as a prized species in recreational fishing and a major contributor to the world's aquaculture production. the genomes of the atlantic salmon and other salmonids are purported to be derivates of an autotetraploidisation event that occurred in their common ancestor  <dig> to  <dig> million years ago . the subsequent re-diploidisation process is not yet complete, and is illustrated in such phenomena as duplicated dna markers ; the formation of tetravalent complexes during male meioses  <cit> ; the apparent linkage of non-linked loci due to non-random dissociation of the tetravalent complexes   <cit> ; unusual, partly tetrasomic, segregation patterns  <cit> ; as well as chromosome arm numbers twice that of most other fin-fish species . furthermore, the formation of tetravalent complexes in males is believed to be the cause of another phenomenon observed in salmonids, very large differences in recombination rates between males and females that vary according to chromosomal region  <cit> .

two low-density maps have been published for atlantic salmon  <cit> , in addition to the salmap map, a higher-density, female microsatellite map made available online  <cit> . this latter map is developed from segregation data from two females from the river tay in scotland  <cit> , and contains ~ <dig> microsatellite type i and type ii markers, out of which approximately  <dig> have been linked to bacs in the physical map  <cit> . further progress in atlantic salmon genomics relies on these existing maps being expanded with additional markers; in particular with single nucleotide polymorphism  markers, since these are the most frequent polymorphisms in addition to being the markers of choice for high-throughput genotyping. of particular value are snp markers located within transcribed regions, to create more links between the genetic and physical maps.

here, we provide an update of an ongoing project aiming at detecting, testing, and mapping large numbers of est-derived snp markers in atlantic salmon  <cit> . we also present a snp/microsatellite map to be used as a framework map, onto which additional snp markers can later be added. furthermore, we present more detailed results on sex-specific differences in recombination rates than has been provided before for this species. finally, we report on levels of linkage disequilibrium  between markers in the aquaculture strain from whence the mapping parents were sampled. levels of ld vary between species and between populations  <cit> , and have major implications for the feasibility of performing e.g. association studies and for fine-mapping quantitative trait loci .

RESULTS
detection and testing of snp markers
hayes et al.  <cit>  previously described the in silico detection of a large number of putative snps for atlantic salmon, and the subsequent experimental testing of  <dig> of these snps in a diverse validation panel. in the present study, another set of  <dig> snp markers were tested in a similar validation panel . of the  <dig> snps,  <dig> were polymorphic, reliably scored, and non-duplicated . of the  <dig> polymorphic, non-duplicated snps,  <dig> were chosen to be genotyped in the mapping families. these  <dig> snps had an average minor allele frequency of  <dig> , and an average observed heterozygosity of  <dig>  . out of  <dig> snps,  <dig>  resided in genes that could be identified and annotated .

aaquacultural population

bthe aqua gen and byglandsfjorden populations came in the form of  <dig> f <dig> hybrids between the two.

snps in the "normal" category were polymorphic, reliably scored and non-duplicated. msv   <cit>  snps were likely duplicated with polymorphism at one or both loci, psv  snps were heterozygous in all animals, and thus likely duplicated without polymorphism. failed snps displayed poor clustering of genotypes and/or unreliably scored genotypes.

linkage map
the mapping families,  <dig> full-sib families from a commercial breeding company, were genotyped for  <dig> snps and for  <dig> microsatellite markers. out of the  <dig> snp markers,  <dig> were polymorphic in at least one mapping parent. the snps belonged to  <dig> contigs,  <dig> of these having one snp,  <dig> having two snps, and five having three snps.

all but four of the informative snps were integrated into the map, as were all  <dig> informative microsatellite markers. the male and female maps consisted of  <dig> and  <dig> linkage groups, respectively . the male map was  <dig> cm long with  <dig> markers in total, while the female map was  <dig> cm long with  <dig> markers in total. lengths of linkage groups ranged from  <dig> cm to  <dig>  cm on the male map, and from  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm on the female map . for the most part the same linkage groups were identified for the male and the female, with the following exceptions i) two linkage groups on the male map  that each corresponded to two linkage groups on the female map, and ii) one linkage group on the female map  that corresponded to two linkage groups on the male map. for  <dig> of all possible marker pairs informative in both sexes, the orientation of markers was not the same in the two sexes . however, in all  <dig> cases the distance between markers on the male map was relatively small , so that these differences most likely reflect upon minor genotyping errors or missing genotypes.

♀female-specific linkage groups

♂male-specific linkage groups

we did not observe in our data set any certain instances of pseudolinkage, the apparent linkage of non-linked chromosomes sometimes observed in male salmonids  <cit> . one likely homeologous relationship that has not been reported before  <cit>  was found; marker ssa418/i was located on lg <dig>  while ssa418/ii was located on lg <dig> 

difference in recombination patterns between sexes and between parents
male recombination rates were much lower than female recombination rates in large parts of the genome. in some regions, however, male recombination rates were significantly higher than those of females. invariably, these regions were located at the end of linkage groups . ratios of male to female recombination fractions for adjacent markers tended to be either close to zero or very large . of the male linkage groups,  <dig> had all their markers grouped into one very tight cluster,  <dig> had one large cluster of closely linked markers located at the end of the linkage group, and one had a large central cluster bordered by markers on either side .

linkage disequilibrium
levels of ld, measured through the correlation coefficient between pairs of loci r <dig>  were calculated for all microsatellite-snp pairs with minor allele frequency  >  <dig>  and heterozygosity  >  <dig> . the average r <dig> for marker pairs with markers located on different linkage groups was  <dig> . the average r <dig> for physically, but not genetically linked marker pairs  was  <dig> . levels of r <dig> increased with decreasing inter-marker distance from ~ <dig> cm, increased more rapidly more from ~ <dig> cm , while r <dig> dropped to half its maximum value  within  <dig> cm.

discussion
linkage map
the male map contained  <dig> linkage groups, corresponding well with the most common karyotype in european atlantic salmon, which has 2n =  <dig>  <cit> . most likely, therefore, each male linkage group corresponds to a separate chromosome. the female map, on the other hand, contained  <dig> linkage groups, including two pairs of linkage groups that each corresponded to a single male homologue. each of these two pairs is likely to correspond to a single linkage group with a large segment not covered by markers.

the lack of markers in at least two segments of the female map shows that the female map is shorter than the true female genetic map. at the same time, the low number of female-informative markers that could not be mapped, in conjunction with the relative good fit of the map length with the length of the salmap map , indicates that the female map coverage most likely is not far from complete. the male map, on the other hand, may still be considerably shorter than the true male genetic map, due to recombination events apparently being localised to a small physical region .

map distances should be expected to be slight overestimates since any genotype errors would tend to inflate genetic distances. although practically all genotypes resulting in double crossovers were re-checked in detail and corrected if necessary, genotype errors cannot be ruled out, in particular not for markers located at the end of linkage groups .

contrary to expectation, we did not observe any instances of pseudolinkage in the data set. pseudolinkage describes the apparent linkage in male mapping parents of markers that are not linked in female mapping parents, with an excess of non-parental genotypes in offspring, and is believed to be caused by the non-random breaking up of tetravalent complexes formed during male meiosis  <cit> . pseudolinkage has earlier been found in several salmonid mapping studies  <cit> . in a recent study on an f <dig> cross between atlantic salmon of canadian and european origin, utilising a subset of the snp markers described in the present study, pseudolinkage was observed between  <dig> pairs of linkage groups . the difference in occurrence of pseudolinkage between the latter study and the present study is in line with a hypothesis stating that pseudolinkage occurs more frequently in inter-strain hybrids than in pure strain fish  <cit> . it should be noted, however, that our findings with respect to pseudolinkage are indicative rather than conclusive since grandparental genotypes were not available, meaning that pseudolinkage could, if present, only be detected as weak linkage in males between markers unlinked in females . also, since linkage phases were deduced from linkage analysis and not from grandparental genotyping, linkage between markers within male linkage groups could theoretically be due to pseudolinkage rather than to classical linkage. however, all markers on the male map were either i) very closely linked to other markers within the same linkage group, and hence very unlikely to be linked through pseudolinkage, or ii) appearing on the homologous linkage group in the female map. from this we conclude that pseudolinkage would be unlikely to be the cause of any observed linkages on this map.

difference in recombination patterns between sexes
in salmonids, male recombination rates are much reduced compared to female recombination rates  <cit> . in rainbow trout the ratio between male and female recombination has been found to vary considerably across linkage groups, with male recombination rates being severely depressed relative to female recombination rates in areas proximal to centromeres, but elevated in regions distal to centromeres  <cit> . this finding has been investigated further in rainbow trout  <cit> , and the same phenomenon has been shown in arctic char  <cit>  and atlantic salmon  <cit> , though not in detail for the latter species. the results presented here support these earlier findings, but indicate that the site-specific differences in recombination rate between sexes are even more pronounced in atlantic salmon than in rainbow trout . since female recombination rates are much higher than male recombination rates for a large majority of adjacent marker pairs , it seems reasonable to assume that the regions where male recombination events occur are substantially smaller in physical terms than the corresponding female regions. this, again, means that, while it is likely that the female map presented here is close to full coverage, the true male map may be substantially longer than the presented male map. higher marker densities will be needed to identify markers located in the regions where male recombination occurs, i.e. telomeric regions.

the most common karyotype of european atlantic salmon consists of  <dig> metacentric and  <dig> acrocentric chromosomes  <cit> . if one assumes that male recombination occurs on all chromosomes, but only in telomeric regions, the complete male map should contain  <dig> linkage groups where a large central cluster of markers is surrounded by markers on both sides, and  <dig> groups with a large cluster at one end. in the map presented here, only linkage group  <dig> has a central cluster surrounded by markers on either side, indicating that the corresponding chromosome is one of the metacentric chromosomes. all other linkage groups have either only one cluster or one cluster with markers on one side, and thus may have one or two telomeric regions not covered by informative markers. further evidence for the identification of linkage groups  as meta- or acrocentric could be extracted from the lengths of linkage groups , and from the number of meioses with more than one recombination event ; if one assumes complete interference  <cit>  then acrocentric chromosomes should have genetic lengths of ~ <dig> cm and a small incidence of meioses with more than one crossover, while metacentric chromosomes should have genetic lengths of ~ <dig> cm and a higher incidence of meiosis with two or more crossovers  <cit> . the linkage group size and number of meioses with >  <dig> recombinants for linkage group  <dig> supports this hypothesis.

the site-specific distribution of male and female recombination events must be taken into account when qtl experiments are designed. in atlantic salmon, it has become quite common to first perform a coarse genome scan using male segregation only and one or a few markers per linkage group, on the assumption that there is practically no recombination in males . while this strategy will work for most parts of the genome, qtls located in telomeric regions  will probably be missed unless markers located in these regions are added. identification of more markers in telomeric region would therefore be highly useful.

in this study, we exploited the lack of male recombination in large parts of the genome to draw more information out of the data. more specifically, for markers located in such regions, when both parents were heterozygous and identical within a given family, heterozygous  offspring were assumed to have inherited the chromosome segment without recombinations from their respective fathers. in this way, alleles inherited from sire and dam could be deduced, and the markers could be re-coded as fully informative. it should be pointed out that this strategy was only used if no male recombinations had been observed in a priori informative offspring, meaning that no recombination had been observed in a minimum of  <dig>  meioses. the strategy was therefore conservative.

linkage disequilibrium
the individuals used for the ld study were a subset of the mapping parents; more specifically,  <dig> mapping parents that belonged to the same breeding population, the remaining four animals belonging to another population. phase-known data were used, since haplotypes could be deduced with very high certainty due to large family sizes.

only microsatellite-snp pairs were used for calculation of ld, thus mimicking the mapping of a qtl  using microsatellites. ld was also computed between snp-snp pairs , and found to be much lower than for microsatellite-snp ld. levels of microsatellite-microsatellite ld were comparable to those of microsatellite-snp ld, though slightly higher . lower ld values for snp-snp pairs when compared to microsatellite-snp or microsatellite-microsatellite pairs is likely to be, at least in part, a consequence of differences in heterozygosity between marker types  <cit> . however, it could also be due in part to higher mutation rates of microsatellites relative to snps, which would impact upon levels of ld . to avoid marker pairs with low information content, snps with minor allele frequencies below  <dig>  and microsatellites with heterozygosities below  <dig>  were culled from ld analysis.

the average r <dig> between markers located on different linkage group was higher than expected . this could be caused by limited effective population size and/or by relatedness between individuals in the sample . however, removing closely related animals did not decrease, but rather increased r <dig> between unlinked markers, indicating that the small sample size may have been the main reason for high ld between unlinked markers. levels of r <dig> is biased upwards when sample sizes are small, although much less so than the ld statistic d'  <cit> . at the same time, ld may have been slightly biased downward by the original detection of snps in est sequences coming from a limited number of animals of both canadian and norwegian origin. detection of snps in a small number of diverse animals could lead to an overrepresentation of old mutations among the set of snps, and thus to underestimation of ld between markers. it is difficult to assess the joint effect of these two factors. however, we have assumed that bias in levels of ld would not greatly affect conclusions regarding changes in ld with changing inter-marker distance.

ld between linked markers seemed to increase with decreasing inter-marker distance in a bi-modal manner. ld first increases slowly from ~ <dig> cm, then more rapidly from ~ <dig> cm. this finding may reflect upon the fact that the population from whence the haplotypes were derived is a 'synthetic' population, formed seven generation ago from individuals from different norwegian rivers  <cit> . due to the limited number of meioses since the formation of the base population , ld within linkage groups caused by population stratification would be expected to persist for long distances. over shorter distances, ld would be caused both by population subdivision and by ld inherent in the wild population from whence the breeding population was formed. since ld observed in the population is likely to be partly caused by population admixture, the results described here may not be relevant for wild atlantic salmon populations. however, many breeding populations, and thus populations used for scanning of qtl/genes affecting commercial traits, are admixed in the same sense, and may thus display similar patterns of ld.

levels of ld were calculated in order to estimate the marker densities needed to perform ld-based mapping in atlantic salmon. the measure r <dig> is equal to the amount of information provided by one locus about the other, meaning that for a gene-trait association to be detected, sample size must be increased by 1/r <dig> if a marker in ld with the trait-affecting gene is used rather than the gene itself. levels of r <dig> from  <dig>  to  <dig>  have been proposed as minimum values of 'useful ld'  <cit> , in which case sample sizes would have to be increased by a factor of three to  <dig> in order to achieve maximum power. if one accepts r <dig> >  <dig>  as the threshold, 'useful ld' could in this study be found at inter-marker distances below ~ <dig> cm, indicating that ~ <dig> fully informative, evenly spaced markers would be sufficient to at least start capturing inherent ld information. thus, currently available maps  could in principle provide a template for ld mapping to some extent. to fully exploit ld in the atlantic salmon genome, however, more dense maps would probably be needed.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we constructed male- and female genetic linkage maps of atlantic salmon, elucidated further the distributions of recombination events in males and females, and provided initial data on levels of linkage disequilibrium. the female map presented here is likely to represent the true genetic map well, whereas the male map is probably incomplete due to male recombination being localised to narrow telomeric regions. there appear to be little overlap between regions in which male and female recombination events occur. levels of ld  were more than  <dig>  above the baseline for unlinked markers at inter-marker distances less than  <dig> cm. at inter-marker distances larger than  <dig> cm, r <dig> decreased slowly, possibly reflecting ld due to population admixture that have had limited time to be broken down by recombination. the map presented here will serve as a framework map onto which a larger number of snp markers, currently being identified from alignment of est sequences and from dna re-sequencing  <cit> , will be added.
