BACKGROUND
hematophagous females of a. gambiae require animal blood for successful reproduction. sequential blood intake is the main route for transmission of the protozoan parasite plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria. the ability of plasmodium parasites to establish infection in the vector mosquito can be compromised by many factors, including mosquito innate immune responses and factors derived from the blood of the human host  <cit> . a better understanding of regulatory circuits and mechanisms that regulate mosquito biology and contribute to vector resistance to plasmodium parasites is urgently needed to curb malaria transmission.

mirnas are approximately  <dig> nucleotides rnas that regulate and influence a wide range of biological and physiological processes in metazoans and plants, playing instructive role throughout development and conferring robustness to gene expression  <cit> . in insects, the mirna pathway has been best characterized in the fruit fly, d. melanogaster. the canonical mirna biogenesis starts from transcription of endogenous primary mirna transcripts typically produced by rna polymerase li. the primary transcripts frequently contain multiple mirna hairpin precursors, which are processed by the nuclear heterodimer dgcr- <dig> and the rnase iii enzyme, drosha. the released ~55-70 nt cleavage product, called a pre-mirna hairpin is exported to the cytoplasm. once in the cytoplasm, the pre-mirna is processed by another rnase iii enzyme, dicer- <dig>  yielding ~22 nt small rna duplexes  <cit> . in drosophila, one of the strands  is preferentially incorporated into an effector mirna-induced silencing complex  containing the argonaute-family protein ago <dig>  the other  strand is sorted into small interfering rnas, sirisc complex with ago <dig> effector protein  <cit> . a number of alternative drosha/dicer-independent pathways producing functional mirnas have been reported  <cit> . however, regardless of the mirna biogenesis diversity, the stability and silencing activity of mature mirna predominantly require ago effector proteins . a comparative phylogenetic analysis of small regulatory rna pathways revealed that major components of mirna biogenesis and ago effector proteins are conserved between a. gambiae and d. melanogaster
 <cit> . it has been shown that sirna-mediated silencing in a. gambiae requires ago <dig>  <cit> , however no evidence of functional association between ago <dig> and mirnas in a. gambiae has been demonstrated so far.

mirnas act as antisense guide for the mirisc complex to recognize target protein coding and non-coding rnas. mirna-target interactions are based on watson-crick base pairing between the mirna seed region  and target rna  <cit> , typically leading to mrna destabilization and translational repression  <cit> . mirna expression levels and patterns rely on both steps of their biogenesis: transcription and processing, and are tightly regulated temporally and spatially during development  <cit> . the predominant mature mirna can be produced from both the 5’- and 3’-arms of pre-mirna hairpins. selection of the functional arm, the precision of mirna processing and post-transcriptional modifications play critical roles in the refining and diversifying of mature mirna sequence and eventual functional activity  <cit> . post-transcriptional modifications at the 3’-end, mostly non-template directed adenylation and uridylation, alter mirna activity and stability by regulating either processing by dicer- <dig> or incorporation into mirisc .

it has recently been reported that mirnas can sense biotic stresses operating as an integral part of host immune responses to microbial infections, caused by viral, bacterial and apicomplexan pathogens . interestingly, in a. gambiae the upstream control regions of the major components of mirna biogenesis, drosha, dcr- <dig> and ago- <dig> are enriched in the potential binding sites for nf-kappab-related transcription factors  <cit> , presumably providing a link between the mirna pathway and immune responses. moreover, rna silencing of ago- <dig> and dcr- <dig> in a. gambiae mosquitoes resulted in the increased survival of the rodent malaria parasite p. berghei
 <cit> . furthermore, a recent study using ribosome profiling in a. gambiae infected with the human malaria parasite p. falciparum revealed an enhanced association of ~ <dig> mosquito immune-related transcripts, including two components of the mirna pathway dcr- <dig> and drosha with polyribosomes  <cit> .

in this study, using small rna sequencing we performed the first systematic analysis of a. gambiae mirnas in adult sugar- and blood-fed females. we provided transcriptional evidence for a wide diversity of mature mirnas and their isoforms. our analysis revealed significant sequence variations among mature mirnas at their 3’-ends, mostly due to imprecise processing during their biogenesis and post-transcriptional modifications. furthermore, our extended set of anopheles mirnas allows us to analyze their expression at an early time point after regular and infectious blood feeding. as a result, we identified  <dig> differentially expressed anopheles mirnas associated with the rodent malaria parasite p. berghei infections.

RESULTS
a. gambiaesmall rna sequencing
the majority of the originally annotated anopheles mirnas have been identified by sequence similarity with d. melanogaster mirna orthologs using sequence and structure alignment  <cit> . in addition, a number of mosquito specific mirnas identified in the closely related species, a. stephensi, cx. quinquefasciatus and ae. aegypti by cloning  <cit>  and deep sequencing  <cit>  has been shown to be conserved in a. gambiae. among  <dig> anopheles mirnas reported in mirbase, less than a half were experimentally validated  <cit> . in order to identify and characterize de novo mirnas in a. gambiae, we constructed small rna libraries from sugar and blood-fed a. gambiae g <dig> adult females, including fecund females. two independent libraries  were prepared and independently sequenced using the illumina high-throughput sequencing platform, yielding a total of ~ <dig>  million sequence reads. we observed a significant correlation between two independent libraries sequencing results . since the genome of the g <dig> strain has not been sequenced, the a. gambiae pest strain genome was used as a reference. after adapter trimming and filtering out ambiguous reads, a total of ~ <dig>  million sequence reads were obtained and ~ <dig>  million sequence reads were aligned. around  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total reads were mapped to the reference genome in sugar and blood-fed mosquitoes, respectively . less than 1% of sequence reads were mapped to the m. musculus genome in sugar-fed mosquitoes, while in blood-fed samples ~ <dig> % of sequence reads derived from mouse genome . analysis of the size distribution and abundance of all sequences within libraries between 17–30 nt revealed two major classes peaking at 21–23 nt and 25–28 nt . accordingly to the sequence analysis and genomic mapping, the first class of reads with a predominance of 22 nt size was ascribed to mirnas .  <dig> % and  <dig> % of mapped reads were assigned to known mirnas in sugar-fed females and blood-fed females, respectively . in the second class,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of mapped reads were associated with repetitive elements in sugar and blood-fed mosquitoes, respectively . interestingly, the proportion of mapped reads derived from trnas and rrnas was increased about  <dig> -fold in blood-fed compared with sugar-fed mosquitoes . this likely reflected the beginning of protein synthesis triggered by blood meal intake.figure  <dig>

using mirdeep <dig> pipeline, we provided transcriptional evidence based on the 5p- and 3p-associated read abundance for  <dig> distinct anopheles mirnas previously reported in mirbase . we identified bantam, mir-263a, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> as the most abundantly expressed mirnas in a. gambiae . among these mirnas, only mir- <dig> has been previously characterized as the most frequently occurring mirna in other mosquito species, ae. aegypti, cx. quinquefasciatus and ae. albopictus
 <cit> . interestingly, a low number of reads supporting the 3p-associated sequence and absence of the 5p-associated reads were detected for the originally annotated by sequence similarity, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> . the extremely low abundance of these mirnas is probably due to their restricted spatial and temporal expression. indeed, in ae. aegypti orthologs of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were detected in embryos and not in the adult females  <cit> . overall, these data support the authenticity of the originally annotated set of a. gambiae mirnas in mirbase.

identification of novel a. gambiaemirnas
to detect putative a. gambiae mirnas, we used mirdeep <dig> and a pipeline developed in-house. only mapped sequence reads were used for the further prediction and expression analyses. we considered a general guideline for microrna annotation in deep-sequencing data . to refine results of the novel mirna prediction, the following criteria were applied: i) detection of at least  <dig> sequence reads mapping to the mirna hairpin per library; ii) valid mirna precursors folding into stem-loop hairpins with folding energy less than −15 kcal/mol; iii) consistency of the 5’-end starting position, measured as an abundance of mapped sequence reads sharing the same 5’-terminus. genuine mirna loci produce so-called mature  and star  sequences  that can be derived from both arms of the mirna precursor. hence, detection of mirna sequence reads associated with the 5’- and 3’-arms of mirna precursor increases a confidence in the novel mirna annotation  <cit> . however, it has been reported that certain mirna might lack mir* reads due to strong asymmetric strand selection during mirna processing  <cit> . therefore, in our study an absence of sequence reads supporting mir* was not considered as a decisive criterion for the annotation of low abundant novel mirnas. to improve the accuracy of prediction of the novel mirnas, only mirnas identified at least in two independent cdna libraries and in two biological experiments were included in the further analyses. furthermore, potential novel mirnas mapped to unknown contigs not associated with any of the three a. gambaie chromosomes, with multiple and inexactly mapped reads were filtered out.

in total,  <dig> distinct mirnas were detected in the mosquito small rna libraries , including distinct  <dig> known and  <dig> putative novel anopheles mirnas . sequence alignment revealed that  <dig> novel mirnas shared a high level of sequence similarity with the mirnas described in other insect species. interestingly, although the anopheles homolog of mir- <dig> was not predicted by mirdeep <dig> in the original data set, the pipeline developed in-house revealed the corresponding 5p- and 3p-associated sequence reads in our libraries .table  <dig>

evolutionary conservation of mirna hairpin is considered as a reliable criterion for prediction of novel mirna genes. remarkably however, the degree of mirna conservation does not always correlate with sequence read abundance  <cit> . for example, we observed that the non-preferred strand of novel anopheles mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> hairpins exhibit a high level of sequence similarity  with known homologous hairpins. in contrast, the most abundant preferred strand of mir- <dig> exhibited sequence divergence in the seed region. moreover, the preferred strand of mir- <dig> shows no significant sequence similarity with any known mirnas. since the preferred strand selection of certain mirnas is not consistently associated with sequence conservation, our data demonstrate the limitations of mirna prediction and annotation based on sequence similarity. we also detected  <dig> mirnas with a sequence similarity restricted to the seed sequence only. among those, putative mirna orthologs were found for  <dig> anopheles mirnas in the closely related mosquito species ae. aegypti and cx. quinquefasciatus . finally, the remaining  <dig> anopheles mirnas had no obvious sequence similarity with known mirnas in other species .

closer examination of mature sequences derived from both arms of the predicted hairpins revealed that  <dig> novel candidate mirna loci were associated with the presence of distal and proximal sequence reads. this might indicate that the candidate mirna is a degradation intermediate  <cit> . recently however, an example of a mirna locus showing signatures of both, host mrna degradation and mirna processing via drosha/dicer cleavage has been reported in drosophila
 <cit> . 80% of those anopheles mirnas mapped to intergenic regions. yet, the possibility of dubious annotation of the predicted protein-coding genes and intergenic regions in vector base cannot be excluded. manual inspection of the mir/mir* sequence reads comprising putative mirna duplexes revealed that 70% of these mirnas exhibit expected 1–2 nt 3’-end overhangs, the signature of substrates processed by the rnase iii enzymes, drosha/dicer. the remaining mirna loci, including intron-derived  and intergenic mirnas show unusual 3’-end overhangs. among those, three intergenic-derived putative mirnas  exhibit very atypical 3’-end overhangs. those mirnas were considered to be low-confidence candidate mirnas ; and therefore further experimental studies will be required to demonstrate their functional association with mirisc.

validation of novel mirna candidates
mature mirna levels and stability require predominantly ago effector proteins. therefore, to increase the specificity of novel mirna prediction, we analyzed mirna levels in ago1-silenced mosquitoes. as a control, we used mosquitoes depleted for ago <dig>  the effector of sirnas. small rna libraries were prepared from mosquitoes injected with dsrna against ago <dig> and ago <dig> and sequenced on the illumina platform. quantification of relative expression by qpcr showed that in the ago1- and ago2-silenced mosquitoes levels of ago <dig> and ago <dig> were downregulated by 50% and 40%, respectively . importantly, no cross-silencing of ago <dig> and ago <dig> expression was detected suggesting that the observed silencing effect was specific to the corresponding target mrna . the taqman-based quantification and validation of the previously annotated mir- <dig> showed that the mir- <dig> expression levels were decreased by 65% in ago1-silenced mosquitoes . accordingly to normalized rna sequence read quantification in ago-silenced libraries, mir- <dig> levels were decreased by ~80% in ago1-silenced mosquitoes, while in ago2-silenced mosquitoes mir- <dig> levels have not been substantially changed . the relative quantification of mature mir- <dig> in our small rna libraries was consistent with qpcr measurements. we then investigated the effect of ago <dig> and ago <dig> silencing on the total mirna expression levels in the dsrna injected mosquitoes, using non-injected mosquitoes as a reference control . we observed a 65% decrease in the total mirna levels in ago1-silenced mosquitoes, corresponding to a median log <dig> fold-change of − <dig>  . silencing of ago <dig> resulted in a log <dig> fold-change of  <dig>  in mirna expression levels . in addition, as an internal negative control, we analyzed levels of small rnas unrelated to the mirna pathways. for snornas, trnas and rrnas, we detected 9% decrease in ago1-silenced mosquitoes , that corresponds to the median log <dig> fold-change of − <dig> , while in ago2-silenced mosquitoes the median log <dig> fold-change of snornas, trnas and rrnas levels was  <dig>  .figure  <dig>

we next examined individual changes in the expression levels of the newly identified mirnas in ago1- and ago2-silenced libraries using expression of known anopheles mirnas as a positive control . a small non-coding rna not related to mirnas u <dig> snrna, invariantly expressed in all our libraries, was used to normalize mirna expression levels. similar log <dig> fold-changes  were observed for the expression levels of the newly identified mirnas  in ago1-silenced mosquitoes as compared to the known mirnas annotated in mirbase  and rfam . in ago2-silenced control, we did not observe substantial changes in the analyzed mirna expression levels . furthermore, the expression levels of ncrnas, unrelated to mirnas  were consistent in both ago1- and ago2-silenced libraries . remarkably, only one newly predicted mirna  with an extremely low number of reads showed no changes in expression levels in ago1-silenced mosquitoes, therefore, it was not considered as a confident mirna candidate. collectively, these data suggested that levels of mature anopheles mirnas were specifically affected by ago <dig> silencing, thereby supporting the accuracy of the mirna prediction and annotation in this study.

mirna sequence heterogeneity
deep sequencing analyses revealed sequence heterogeneity at the 5’- and 3‘-end of mature mirna sequences, collectively called iso-mir variations. such sequence variations can occur due to inaccurate processing by drosha/dicer- <dig>  degradation and non-template sequence extension . analysis of sequence variations due to mismatches between the reads in our libraries and their corresponding genomic loci revealed ~ <dig> % reads within mature mirna sequences with 1 nt and more mismatching from their genomic loci. it has been reported that mirna might be subjected to rna editing by adenosine deaminase  and cytidine deaminase   <cit> . therefore, we analyzed occurrences of the putatively edited mature mirna sequence reads in our libraries. we did not find any evidence for the enrichment of a to g and c to u changes compared with other types of nucleotide alterations. therefore, the observed sequence variations detected within mature mirnas can be attributed to sequencing errors and/or to sequence variations between the query and the reference genome.

the specificity of target recognition is mostly determined by the 5’-end of mirnas  <cit> . furthermore, the 5’-end precision and homogeneity of mature mirnas show a high degree of evolutionary constraint. therefore, we carefully analyzed cleavage accuracy of mirna sequence reads associated with the 5’- and 3’-arms of mirna precursors in our libraries. we detected high 5’-end fidelity of the 5p- and 3p-associated sequence reads that was nearly identical . similar tendency was observed for the 5’-end homogeneity of mature and star mirna sequences . importantly, we identified a group of mirnas, including mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-263a, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  with heterogenous 5’-ends . mir-2- <dig> and mir-2- <dig> have been previously reported in mirbase as a mirna with identical mature sequence, referred to as mir-2b and mir-2c, respectively. for mir- <dig>  there were two abundant classes of the 5’-end, the one with the originally reported in mirbase and another, which was with 2 nt shorter . in drosophila, mir- <dig> subjected to alternative processing also produces two distinct mir- <dig> isoforms with 2 nt shifted 5’-ends with respect to each other  <cit> . we identified mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> with an extra 5’ cytosine matched to the sequence of the pre-mirna. for mir- <dig>  two dominant mature species occur with the originally annotated 5’-end  and with an extra 5’ cytosine  . similar variation at the 5’-end has been described in d. melanogaster mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  illustrating an example of the single hairpin generating mature mir with different abundant 5’-ends  <cit> . in cx. quinquefasciatus, two dominant iso-mir species have been reported for mir- <dig>  one of which contains an additonal cytosine nucleotide at its 5’-end  <cit> . interestingly, a. gambiae mir- <dig> has only one dominant species with 5’-end cytosine addition . the originally annotated 5’-end for mir- <dig>  is represented by a small fraction of reads  in our libraries. since in a. gambiae there are no paralogs of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  this difference cannot be due to processing of mature mir from distinct homologous precursors. in cx. quinquefasciatus, two dominant species have been reported for mir- <dig>  one of which is 1 nt longer, with an extra cytosine residue at the 5’-end  <cit> . similar modification at their 5’-end were detected in a. albopictus mir- <dig>   <cit> . for mir- <dig> identified in this study, we found 99% of mature reads with a template-directed cytosine addition at the 5’-end . this consistent 5’-end cytosine addition had also been reported for aedes mir- <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, the predominant sequence of mir-263a was associated with a 3-nt shifted 5’-end; no sequence reads corresponding to the originally annotated sequence  were detected in our libraries . for mir- <dig>  fewer than 1% of sequence reads corresponded to the mature sequence reported in mirbase v <dig>  instead, the majority of the annotated reads  were 1 nt shorter at their 5’-ends . collectively, the detected variations at the 5’-end of mature mirnas that result in the functional-seed shifting, were observed for more than 5% of anopheles mirnas across analyzed libraries.figure  <dig>

significant sequence heterogeneity was also observed at the 3’-end of mirna sequence reads . this is consistent with the general observation that 3’-end sequence variation is more common than 5’-end variation  <cit> . within all mature mirna reads, around 14% reads have undergone more than 1 nt trimming or degradation at the 3’-end. among the extremely abundant mirnas, 1–2 nt trimming at the 3’-end was observed for 20% of reads from bantam and mir-10; for 17% of reads from mir-263a and for 32% of reads from mir- <dig> . next we extensively analyzed the 3‘-end sequence extension  due to template and non-template directed nucleotide additions . analysis of the 3’-end composition revealed that the 5p-associated sequence reads were preferentially subjected to template-directed extension of one or more nucleotides . furthermore, the frequency of non-template-directed additions was substantially lower at the 3’-end of 5p-associated sequences with respect to the 3p-associated reads . among the abundant anopheles mirnas, more than 60% of mir-263a reads were  <dig> – 3 nt longer at the 3’-end than its mature sequence reported in mirbase , which was represented by ~2% of reads. moreover, about one quarter of bantam and mir- <dig> reads was 1 nt longer than their corresponding mature sequences reported in mirbase . the described above nucleotide additions matched to the corresponding pre-mirna sequences, indicating a template-directed origin of these additions most likely due to imprecise processing. in addition, we observed that mirna loci, such as mir- <dig>  let- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> produced from one fourth to one third of sequence reads tailed by template-directed adenine addition. remarkably, a significant proportion of detected template-directed adenine and uracil additions in sequence reads derived from the 5’-arm is associated with mir- <dig> . moreover, the majority of template-directed uracil extensions in the 3’-arm-derived reads are associated with bantam . it has been reported that sequence variation occurring due to imprecise cleavage by drosha and dicer are more frequent than non-template addition  <cit> . a similar tendency was observed for the 5p-associated sequence variations of anopheles mirnas . however, the frequencies of template and non-template-directed additions were near similar at the 3’-end of the 3p-associated sequence reads . the most predominant non-template directed nucleotide additions associated with the 5p-reads were adenine  and uracil  nucleotides . we found that mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-281* and certain abundant isoforms of mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-263a and mir- <dig> were substantially adenylated. furthermore, we observed a bias toward uridylation in mirna sequence reads  derived from the 3’-arm of the precursor mirna across analyzed libraries . such modifications were mostly associated with mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-92b and mir- <dig>  strikingly, more than 80% of detected non-template directed uracil additions were associated with mir- <dig> . the additions of cytosine and guanosine were detected only for 1-5% of sequence reads . taken together, the levels of the 3’ uridylation and adenylation were substantially greater than other types of nucleotide additions in anopheles mirnas. this is consistent with the earlier reported observations for mammalian and insect mirnas  <cit> .

functional arm usage and shifts in sugar and blood-fed mosquitoes
analysis of the 5’- and 3’-arm usage in drosophila revealed a slight bias towards 5’-arm usage . in contrast, in a. gambiae, we observed a bias towards 3’-arm usage , which was consistent with abundance of sequence reads associated with the 3’-arm of precursor mirnas . it has been reported that selection and usage of the preferred arm can be dynamically regulated during development in a tissue-specific manner  <cit> . switching in the functional arm usage changes the mature mirna sequence selection and production, which consequently influences the target repertoire and function of a given mirna. notably, sequences associated with the non-preferred arm might also exhibit specific function in vivo
 <cit> . to explore the preferred arm selection in anopheles mirnas, we reanalyzed arm usage reported in mirbase v <dig> and compared it with our data sets. we identified a group of mirnas, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> that produced corresponding mir* at significantly higher levels compared to their mature mirs reported in mirbase . among these mirnas, the mature mirna sequence homologous to anopheles mir-281* has been reported earlier as predominantly expressed in cx. quinquefasciatus
 <cit> . in addition, the newly identified a. gambiae ortholog of mir- <dig> also predominantly produced mir-2940* across all analyzed libraries . furthermore, we identified two anopheles mirnas, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> that were not subjected to strong asymmetric strand selection . they produced sequence reads associated with the 5’- and 3’-arm of the precursor at nearly the same levels, suggesting that preferred and non-preferred strands of the mirna duplex are equally processed. the equal strand selection for mir- <dig> has been previously reported in ae. albopictus
 <cit> . interestingly, a shift from the predominant arm usage to a nearly equal 5p/3p species production was observed for mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> in the libraries derived from blood-fed mosquitoes . however, overall blood meal intake did not affect the frequency of the relative arm usage more than 10-fold in a. gambiae libraries .figure  <dig>

we next analyzed species-specific arm selection by comparing the relative arm usage between a. gambiae, ae. aegypti and d. melanogaster . we retrieved insect mirna homologs by considering 1: <dig> orthologous mirna pairs between these species for the analysis . comparison of the relative arm usage revealed four mirnas switching their preferred arms . mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> predominantly used the 5’-arm in anopheles, whereas the 3’-arm was preferentially used in drosophila. the opposite tendency was observed for mir- <dig>  comparison between sugar-fed anopheles and aedes female mosquitoes revealed no difference in the relative arm usage . strikingly, 10-fold greater difference in relative arm usage was observed for mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> orthologs in blood-fed anopheles compared to aedes females . taken together, our data revealed an existence of species-specific production of dominant mature mirnas that might be involved in the regulation of the blood meal-induced physiological traits in the mosquito species and could be associated with the species diversification during diptera evolution.

genomic organization, duplication and clustering of anophelesmirna genes
analysis of genomic organization revealed that around 68% of a. gambiae mirnas were intergenic mirnas. the remaining 32% showed an overlap with the predicted transcripts annotated in vector base often mapping to the coding  strand. among those, 25% of mirnas were located in introns, whereas ~7% were mapped to exons. expression of sense strand-derived mirnas most likely coincides with expression of the host gene. only three newly identified mirnas were on the non-coding  strands of the overlapping transcripts. such genomic organization of host genes and antisense mirnas might have a regulatory function to interfere with mirna transcription, or might affect the host gene to influence mrna splicing or to target sense mrna. interestingly, known insect-specific antisense transcribed mirnas mir- <dig> and iab- <dig> do not exhibit conserved genomic organization in a. gambiae. furthermore, we did not find any examples of mirnas convergently transcribed from both sense and antisense strands in a. gambiae.

mirna gene duplication is an important source of phenotypic plasticity, robustness and diversity in development. the previously described sets of anopheles mirna paralogous genes include mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> . we analyzed multiple mapped a. gambiae mirnas, scoring the new paralogous mirnas as a duplication of pre-mirna precursors and/or mature and star sequences. mirnas detected in unknown contigs not associated with any of three a. gambaie chromosomes, with mismatches to the reference genome were filtered out. we further extended paralogous mirna gene sets by describing new homologs of known anopheles mirnas and of new mirnas annotated in this study . novel mir- <dig>  shares 100% similarity with the mature and star sequences of the originally annotated mir- <dig> , showing sequence divergence only within the terminal loop. mature mir- <dig> sequence was represented by two perfect copies, whereas star and terminal loop sequences of the two mir- <dig> paralogous genes were not conserved. moreover, mir- <dig> identified in this study was represented by three homologous genes: mir-2944a-1/- <dig> and mir-2944b . finally, we annotated a novel member of the mir- <dig> gene family , mir-2a .figure  <dig>

mirnas are frequently clustered in the genome  and are most likely expressed from polycistronic transcripts. we analyzed the organization of mirna clusters and their evolutionary conservation within the mosquito species . the analysis of mirna clusters in a. gambiae genome revealed that approximately 40% of mirnas are clustered on the x chromosome. around 36% of mirnas were closely linked on the chromosomes  <dig> and 3r, however no mirna clusters were found on the chromosome 3 l. we observed that 20% of anopheles mirnas were closely linked within 1 kb genomic distance. for larger clusters, around 30% of mirnas were linked within 5–10 kb genomic distance and approximately 40% of mirnas were closely linked at the distance of 50 kb and less . the mean number of mirnas per cluster was two for 1 kb genomic distance and three mirnas for  <dig> – 50 kb genomic distance . collectively, these data indicates that one third of anopheles mirnas are closely linked within 50 kb. we also observed that all closely linked anopheles mirnas are located on the same stand within analyzed clusters. expression levels of clustered mirnas were significantly correlated across all mosquito libraries . nevertheless, further regulation at the processing level might provide the eventual “activity” patterns distinct from the expression patterns for the neighboring mirnas of the same cluster. the proportion of clustered mirnas producing the dominant mirna from the same arm was  <dig>  within a distance of 50 kb and less, and  <dig>  for non-clustered mirnas scored at a distance more than 50 kb, revealing a strong bias towards the same arm selection for clustered mirnas with respect to non-clustered mirnas.

we further analyzed a conservation of clustered mirnas between anopheles and aedes genomes within 10 kb of genomic distance . since the repertoire of mirnas largely overlaps between these mosquito species, comparison of mirna clusters consistently revealed a high level of conservation between a. gambiae and ae. aegypti. around 68% of clusters containing four mirnas maintained their closely linked organization in both species. moreover, more than 75% of conserved orthologous mirnas grouped in clusters of two, three and five mirnas were linked in aedes. importantly, this analysis allowed us to revise the clustered mirna sets in anopheles. we further extended previously predicted by sequence similarity mir-2/mir- <dig> cluster  by providing evidences for mir-2a and mir- <dig> expression in our study . notably, the organization of mir-2/mir-13/mir- <dig> cluster is highly conserved in invertebrates  <cit> . other examples are the newly described mir-2944a and mir-2944b, which formed a cluster with the previously annotated mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> . interestingly, we identified a fragmented duplication of the mir-2944/mir-309/mir- <dig> cluster, which included only mir-2944a/mir- <dig> and lacked mir- <dig>  in ae. aegypti, the fragmented cluster contains only mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  lacking mir- <dig>  although clustering of mir-2944/mir-309/mir- <dig> was conserved between a. gambiae and ae. aegypti, the fragmented clusters described above represent an example of mirna cluster diversification between these mosquito species. anopheles mir- <dig>  identified in this study, is closely linked with mir- <dig> at a distance shorter than 1 kb. however, the clustering organization of these mirnas is not conserved in aedes. in a. gambiae, mir- <dig> was represented by a cluster of two paralogous genes, mir-965- <dig> and mir-965- <dig>  whereas only a single mir- <dig> ortholog was described in aedes. finally, we identified a novel cluster containing two a. gambiae-specific mir-n <dig> and mir-n <dig> that shared no significant homology with any known mirnas . the mirna expression profiling revealed a relatively low abundance of these mirnas . mir-n <dig> might potentially arise from four clustered hairpin precursors. three out of four hairpin precursors represented a perfect duplication of mir-n <dig>  the fourth hairpin precursor was slightly divergent showing minor sequence changes in the mature and star sequences supported by sequence reads in our libraries. in summary, mirna clustering is highly conserved between aedes and anopheles indicating the orthologous origin of these clusters. the described a. gambiae-specific mirna gene clustering and cluster fragmentation are most likely an example of the evolutionary “young” species-specific mirna segregation emerging through gene duplication followed by sequence divergence due to mutational drift.

regulation of mirna expression by regular and infectious blood feeding
in order to identify mirnas regulated by blood feeding, we first compared the relative abundance of mirnas in sugar-fed mosquitoes and in mosquitoes 3 h after a feeding on a mouse . using log <dig> fold-change, more than  <dig>  as a threshold, we revealed changes in abundance of mir- <dig>  mir-92a, mir- <dig> and newly described mir-n <dig> . the expression levels of abundant mir- <dig> and mir-92a were more than 5- and 25-fold upregulated by blood feeding, respectively. mir-92a is a highly conserved mirna in animals, including the mammalian blood-hosts of mosquitoes, with minor species-specific sequence variations at the 3’ end . therefore, we examined the origin of mir-92a elevated levels in the analyzed libraries. the analysis of mir-92a-associated sequence reads in sugar-fed mosquitoes revealed that mir-92a was represented by two classes: a 22 nt-long mature sequence reported in mirbase as aga-mir-92a and another sequence of a 20 nt . in blood-fed females, four distinct predominant mir-92a classes were detected, including the above described anopheles-specific mature sequences and two mature sequences assigned to m. musculus . around 90% of the total mature mir-92a reads in blood-fed mosquitoes were associated with the two isoforms of mmu-mir-92a . interestingly, the predominant mouse mmu-mir-92a sequence isoform detected in the blood-fed libraries was identical with the human hsa-mir-92a sequence reported in mirbase . no significant changes were observed in the levels of endogenous anopheles aga-mir-92a . taken together our data suggest that the dramatic change in mir-92a levels resulted from the exogenous mirna intake occurred during blood feeding.figure  <dig>

to assess the early responses of anopheles mirnas specific to p. berghei infection, we compared mirna expression levels in females 3 h after regular and infectious blood feeding. we identified  <dig> mirnas responding to the p. berghei parasite presence . among those, two highly expressed mirnas, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were more than 5- and 3-fold upregulated by p. berghei infection, respectively. the remaining differentially expressed mirnas showed a relatively low abundance. overall, the anopheles mirnas identified here might represent early and dynamically regulated mosquito sensors that respond to normal and infectious blood meals.

discussion
in the current study, using small rna sequencing, we performed the first systematic analysis of anopheles mirnas and iso-mirs. highly expressed anopheles mirnas  are represented by numerous mature sequence variants that vary in their abundance across all analyzed libraries. we characterized 5’-end variations in detail, which alter mirna seed sequences, thereby diversifying the target specificity of a given mirna. we showed that more than 5% of anopheles mirnas exhibit shifts in the functional seed sequences. these include newly described predominant isoforms of known anopheles mirnas, such as mir-263a, mir- <dig>  or mir- <dig> that are abundantly expressed across all libraries. the detected here predominant mature sequences of these mirnas are distinct from those originally predicted by sequence similarity . interestingly, anopheles mirna loci such as mir-2b/-c are capable of producing equal numbers of the highly expressed iso-mir species with alternative 5’-ends. remarkably, drosophila homologous mir- <dig> is also subject to alternative dicer processing  <cit> . the origin of the conserved processing pattern of mir- <dig> homologs is unclear. it has been reported recently, that the alternative length of mature mirnas can be regulated by the interacting partners of rnase iii enzymes  <cit> . therefore, generation of alternative iso-mir- <dig> may require specific trans-acting factors regulating precision of drosha/dicer cleavage.

we also laboriously characterized mirna sequence heterogeneity at 3’-ends . the substantial fraction of anopheles mirnas exhibits 3’-end trimming and additions. among nongenome-matching  3’-nucleotide extensions, uracil and adenine additions were the most predominant modifications of the mature mirna sequences across analyzed mosquito libraries. strikingly, in a. gambiae, 80% of nontemplate-directed urydilated reads derived from mir- <dig>  the number of described 3’ additions in this study might be significantly underestimated since certain adenine and uracil additions map to adjacent genomic sequence of the pre-mirna  and therefore, it was not possible to discern unambiguously between template- and nontemplate-directed additions. it has been reported that 3’ adenylation stabilizes mirnas  <cit> , whereas uridylation targets mirnas for degradation . in other studies, a bias towards 3’ uridylation was observed for the ago-immunoprecipitated mirna fraction  <cit> . in contrast, it has been shown that 3’ adenylation correlated with the reduced association between mirnas and mirisc  <cit> . regardless of how this controversy is ultimately resolved, both modifications can impact mirna processing and activity profoundly.

functions of the most abundantly tailed mir- <dig>  bantam and mir- <dig> are not known yet in a. gambiae. it has been reported that bantam downregulates ecdysone signaling during larval development in drosophila
 <cit> . in addition, the ecdysone-responsive drosophila mir- <dig> regulates insulin signaling and innate immune homeostasis  <cit> . the comparison of consistently adenylated and uridylated mirna sets identified in this study and reported in  <cit>  revealed that the described 3’-end additions are not conserved in drosophila homologous mirnas. nevertheless, the detected 3’ extensions of mir- <dig> and bantam might be a signature of their activity in the complex regulatory network of insulin and ecdysone signaling in a. gambiae females triggered by blood meal intake.

the anopheles genus separated approximately 120– <dig> milllion years ago from another blood-feeding mosquito genus aedes, which is the main arbovirus vector responsible for transmitting alpha- and flaviviruses to humans. despite the divergence and complexity of the aedes genome with respect to anopheles, the comparative analysis of our mirna data sets and ae. aegypti mirnas revealed that more than a half of mirnas were evolutionary conserved between these species. overall, the relative arm usage of homologous mirna loci was largely consistent in both anopheles and aedes. yet, our study revealed an example of a remarkable change in the relative arm usage frequency in mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> loci in response to blood feeding. one third of anopheles mirnas are closely linked in the genome, and such clustering organization is largely conserved between aedes and anopheles. importantly, we described de novo emergence of species-specific mirnas together with mirna gene duplication and/or segregation in new clusters and further cluster fragmentation, which might be important for shaping of vector competence traits in these insects.

functional arm switching significantly diversifies the regulatory capacity of mirna genes. selection of the preferred arm is regulated in a tissue- and organ-specific manner during development  <cit> . we did not detect dramatic changes in arm switching between sugar- and blood-fed anopheles mosquitoes, whereas substantial fluctuations in the 5’/3’-arm usage were observed. interestingly, we identified two examples of anopheles mirna loci, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> with absence of strong asymmetry in the preferred strand selection . furthermore, the preferred arm usage in mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> loci was tilted after blood feeding to a nearly equal production of mature and star sequence species. all together, our extended set of anopheles mirnas and their isoforms provides a ground for further experimental studies of mirna patterns and biological functions in a. gambiae.

comparative analysis of mirna abundance revealed dramatically elevated levels of mir-92a after blood meal intake. interestingly, the sequence fraction assigned to mir-92a was enriched in mmu-mir-92a derived from the blood-host mouse. the mammalian mir-92a is a member of the conserved mir-17- <dig> cluster, whose over-expression is associated with lymphomas and other cancers  <cit> . characterization of mirna expression profiles in human blood revealed abundant expression of mir- <dig> in mature erythrocytes  <cit> . consistent with this observation, elevated levels of human mir-92a were detected in the mosquito small rna libraries prepared from females fed on human donor blood . we identified a set of highly abundant murine mirnas in mosquito females fed on regular and infected blood . interestingly, the p. berghei infection was associated with significant changes in abundance of mmu-mir- <dig>  mmu-mir- <dig>  mmu-mir- <dig> and mmu-mir- <dig>  it has been reported that host blood-derived factors, such as human insulin, can modulate immunity and susceptibility of anopheles mosquitoes to human plasmodium infections  <cit> . however, the function of mirnas derived from host-blood in mosquito physiology and anti-plasmodium defenses has not been examined and requires further investigation.

it has been previously reported that plasmodium infection was associated with significant changes in the expression of mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> detected at 24–48 h after p. berghei infection  <cit> . interestingly, no overlap between sets of differentially expressed mirnas reported in this study and by winter et al.  <cit>  was found. this discrepancy most probably reflects the dynamic changes in the mirna expression profiles after an infectious meal. the further detailed study of the plasmodium-responsive mirna expression patterns and function may uncover new pathways and effectors that limit the parasite development within its insect host.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides transcriptional evidences based on the 5p- and 3p-associated read abundance for  <dig> mirnas, including distinct  <dig> mirnas previously reported in mirbase and  <dig> newly identified mirnas in a. gambiae. out of the newly described mirnas,  <dig> novel mirnas are potentially specific to a. gambiae. importantly, sequence read abundance of certain mirnas, such as newly identified mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and other mirnas  was not associated with the mature sequences predicted by sequence similarity. we extended a list of known mosquito-specific mirnas previously reported by li et al.  <cit>  by describing  <dig> novel mirnas conserved in aedes . detailed bioinformatics analysis provided evidences for functionally significant variations in mature sequences of anopheles mirnas and their isoforms occurring at their 5’- and 3’-ends in sugar- and blood-fed mosquitoes . moreover, we observed substantial variations in relative arm usage and arm-switching events showing the existence of species-specific production of dominant mature mirnas induced by blood feeding in mosquitoes . we identified new conserved and fragmented mirna clusters and a. gambiae-specific mirna gene duplication . taken together, sequence variations, functional shifting and switching in mature mirna sequences, described in this study, diversify significantly mirna regulatory capacity in a. gambiae.

a. gambiae mosquitoes are the major vectors of human malaria in sub-saharan africa. we identified a set of the differentially expressed mirnas that early respond to normal and infectious blood meals. the expression levels of the highly abundant mirnas, mir- <dig> and exogenous mmu-mir-92a were significantly increased in blood-fed mosquitoes; while mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were significantly upregulated after p. berghei parasite infections. further experimental study will require to discern the functions of the exogenous mirnas derived from the host-blood and the plasmodium-responsive mirnas in the mosquito physiology and immunity.
