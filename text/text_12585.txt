BACKGROUND
chickpea , the fourth most important grain-legume crop, is grown in more than  <dig> countries, mostly in arid and semiarid zones. approximately 90% of the crop is grown under rainfed conditions, wherein yield is significantly affected by abiotic stresses such as drought, heat, and cold  <cit> . drought-related yield losses can occur in 40%-60% of the total chickpea production  <cit> . terminal drought, which occurs at the pod filling and seed-developing stage of the crop and increases in severity at the end of the season, is a major constraint to chickpea production  <cit> . the identification of differentially expressed genes between  <dig> genotypes differing in drought tolerance and a set of their progenies can therefore be an important indicator of drought-associated genes in chickpea.

functional genomics approaches have been used in recent years to understand the stress-responsive mechanism in plants. candidate genes involved in drought tolerance mechanisms have been identified, characterized, and assessed for their comparative transcriptional activity by using whole-genome sequencing or expressed sequence tag  libraries. several functional genomics studies have been performed in chickpea to identify the abiotic stress-responsive transcripts by approaches such as suppression subtractive hybridization , super serial analysis of gene expression , microarray, and est sequencing  <cit> . additional file  <dig> summarizes results of previous studies on identifying ests associated with drought stress in chickpea.

ssh has been widely used to compare patterns of gene expression in tissues under different conditions. however, it has not yet been used to identify differentially expressed transcripts  in chickpea in response to drought stress at the flowering stage of plants. in all earlier studies, except the one by varshney et al.  <cit> , water stress was imposed by either completely withdrawing water or allowing uprooted young seedlings to wilt at room temperature. however, under field conditions, water stress progresses gradually and a similar type of stress is simulated in the laboratory by the "dry down experiment," which allows comparison of different genotypes and their response toward drought  <cit> . moreover, stress response of a plant at the seedling stage can be very different from that at the reproductive stage, the latter being an important and yield-determining stage in chickpea.

in the present study, we constructed several reciprocal ssh libraries by using drought-tolerant and -susceptible genotypes as well as extreme recombinant inbred lines  for the high root biomass  and low root biomass  under terminal drought stress. this approach differs from that used in earlier studies in the following aspects:  use of  <dig> chickpea genotypes differing in their drought-tolerance capacity and their ril progenies;  drought stress imposed at the flowering stage in a gradual manner by the dry down method;  plant samples analyzed when each plant experienced the same amount of stress, as judged by their transpiration ratio; and  reciprocal subtraction of transcripts by using control and stress conditions as well as susceptible and tolerant genotypes to enable a good comparison and identify both up- and downregulated genes. thus, the est set we used is novel and represents genes that are up and downregulated in response to terminal drought stress, and can thereby help several genes that have not been shown to be previously associated with drought stress in chickpea. the differentially expressed ests were analyzed using macro-array, northern blotting, and quantitative pcr.

methods
plant material
the drought-tolerant characteristics of chickpea line icc  <dig> and drought-susceptible characteristics of icc  <dig> have been attributed to their large and prolific and small root system, respectively. an ril mapping population  of icc  <dig>  and icc  <dig>  has been developed and phenotyped at the international crops research institute for the semi-arid tropics , patancheru . the root phenotyping experiment was conducted in pvc cylinders with  <dig> cm diameter and  <dig> cm height, filled with soil-sand mixture in open field conditions. plants were sampled at  <dig> days after sowing and different measurements were recorded as described by kashiwagi et al.  <cit> . ten rils for extreme phenotype of high root biomass and low root biomass were selected on the basis of phenotypic evolution  to prepare bulk cdna ssh libraries.

stress treatment
dry down procedure
dry down, a gradual and progressive water deficit stress, was given to plants  <cit> . experiments were conducted in triplicate in a glass house receiving natural solar radiation, with air temperature regulated between 23°c and 28°c . seeds of icc  <dig>  icc  <dig>   <dig> rils each for hrb and lrb, were sown in plastic pots of 8-in. diameter. water stress  treatment was initiated  <dig> days after the emergence of plants. all pots were saturated with water and left overnight to drain excess water. next day, the surfaces of pots were covered with plastic beads to prevent water loss through the soil surface. weight  of individual pots was recorded daily in the morning at approximately  <dig>  h. daily loss of water through transpiration was calculated as the difference in pot weight on the current day from that on the previous day. control plants were maintained at approximately 80% field capacity by daily compensation of water loss due to transpiration. to expose ws plants to a progressive water deficit, they were allowed to lose a maximum of  <dig> g of water per day; any additional loss was compensated by adding water to the pots. the transpiration of each plant was then calculated as the difference in its weight on successive days, plus water added on the previous day. transpiration data were analyzed as described previously  <cit> . well watered  pots were maintained at a normalized transpiration ratio  value of  <dig> and ws treatment was continued until the ratio of the transpiration of the stressed plant to the average transpiration of ww plants reached ≤ <dig> , that is, when the transpiration of ws plants was <1% of the ww plants, a stage defined as the endpoint for the water deficit treatment  <cit> . ws plants reached this stage in  <dig> to <dig> day of initiation of stress treatment. at this stage, shoot and the root tissues from ww and ws plants were separately harvested, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°c for rna extraction.

rna and mrna isolation
total rna was isolated by using the trizol reagent , and mrna was further isolated by using the polyatract mrna isolation system . to construct bulk libraries, equal amounts of total rna  isolated from  <dig> rils of extreme hrb and  <dig> rils of extreme lrb were pooled separately and used for mrna isolation.

suppression subtractive hybridization 
to isolate genotype and tissue-specific transcripts related to drought,  <dig> subtraction strategies were employed . in the first strategy, forward subtraction was carried out by subtracting the cdna of ww icc  <dig> root tissue from that of the ws icc  <dig> root tissue to isolate differentially upregulated genes in roots under drought stress. reverse subtraction was performed to isolate downregulated genes under drought stress. similarly, forward and reverse subtractive libraries were made from the shoot tissue. in the second strategy, reciprocal subtraction of cdna from root tissue of icc  <dig> and icc  <dig>  both receiving ws treatment, was performed to isolate differentially expressed genes in the genotypes. in the third approach, cdna from  <dig> rils, each showing extreme phenotype for hrb and lrb for reciprocal subtraction, was used to isolate drought-associated differentially expressed genes in rils exhibiting extreme root biomass phenotype.

subtractive libraries were constructed by using the clontech pcr-select™ cdna subtraction kit , starting with  <dig> μg of mrna from tester and drivers samples. table  <dig> lists the testers and drivers used to construct  <dig> different ssh libraries. forward and reverse subtraction was performed according to manufacturer's instructions to identify the transcript enriched in one sample relative to the other. subtracted cdnas were purified by the minelute pcr purification kit  and ligated into a pgem-t easy vector . ligated plasmid dnas were used for transformation into competent e. coli strain dh5α. positive clones were selected on an ampicillin/iptg/x-gal lb plate. plasmid dna from positive clones were isolated by using real  <dig> plasmid isolation kit , and purified dna was used for single-pass sanger sequencing by using t7/sp6/m13f universal sequencing primers.

high root biomass genotype  icc  <dig> and low root biomass genotypes  icc  <dig> are tagged with "a" and "b" for library description respectively. hqs: high quality sequences, 1-1: forward subtraction, 2-2: reverse subtraction, ww: well watered, ws: water stressed plants.

sequence processing
all sequences were checked for quality and then analyzed by seqman™ ii  <dig>   to detect and remove pgemt-easy vector sequences. a perl script est trimmer  <cit>  was used to trim adaptors, poly a/t ends. est sequences which were less than  <dig> bp long were removed. manual sequence processing was also performed to confirm results. ests from individual libraries were assembled into contigs, using default parameters of cap <dig>  <cit> . incorporation of ests into a contig required at least 95% sequence identity and a minimum 40-bp overlap. ests from all  <dig> libraries also underwent cap <dig> analysis to produce a differentially expressed unigene dataset.

sequence annotation
the ncbi blast program  <cit>  version  <dig> . <dig> was used to perform blastn and blastx similarity searches. blastn analysis was performed to determine sequence homology at the nucleotide level of this unigenes set with est databases of medicago truncatula, glycine max, lotus japonicus, and phaseous vulgaris and also with ests of model plant species such as arabidopsis thaliana, oryza sativa, and populus alba downloaded from ncbi. the cutoff expectation -value threshold for blastn searches was ≤1e- <dig>  blastx was performed against ncbi non-redundant  database using blast2go with an e-value cutoff of <1e- <dig> 

functional categorization and go enrichment analysis
functional annotation was performed by using blast2go   <cit> , following the standard procedure of blastx for unigenes dataset  cutoff length  <dig>  report  <dig> hits, maximum e-value  <dig> e-3), followed by mapping and annotation . go terms were summarized according to their molecular functions, biologic processes, and cellular components. enzyme mapping of annotated sequences was performed by using direct go to enzyme mapping and used to query the kyoto encyclopaedia of genes and genomes  to define the kegg orthologs . these kos were then plotted into the whole metabolic atlas by using the kegg mapping tool  <cit> .

go enrichment analysis was performed by using the fisher exact test, as implemented in the gossip module  <cit>  integrated in blast2go package. for go enrichment analysis, all go terms with a cut-off threshold of pfdr ≤  <dig>  were considered differentially enriched between  <dig> set of est libraries. to study the genotype-specific response for icc  <dig> and icc  <dig> under drought stress, go enrichment analysis was performed between ests developed from the ssh libraries ab1- <dig> and ab2- <dig>  which were constructed to identify transcripts induced in response to drought in the tolerant genotype icc  <dig> and the susceptible genotype icc  <dig>  respectively.

macroarray and northern hybridization
to screen the differentially expressed ests identified in present work, two different macroarray experiments were conducted. in the first experiment, a nylon macroarray in 96-well format, using unigenes from as1- <dig> and as2- <dig> libraries, was constructed and total rna from ww and ws plants of icc  <dig> were used to evaluate the differentially expressed unigenes under water stressed condition. where as in second experiment, a nylon macroarray in a 96-well format, using unigenes from ab1- <dig> and ab2- <dig> libraries, was constructed and total rna from water-stressed icc  <dig> and icc  <dig> were used to evaluate the genotype-specific response under water stress condition.

equal amounts of purified pcr amplified products  was spotted onto nylon membranes , using the dot-blot apparatus in  <dig> formats. each blot was prepared in duplicate. pcr-amplified products of actin cdna  as a housekeeping gene for normalization of the signals between the blots and neomycin phosphotransferase  as a negative control for signal background correction were spotted on the membrane and cross-linked using uv. rna samples were labeled during first-strand cdna synthesis. total rna  was reverse transcribed, using superscript iii rt enzyme  in the presence of α- dctp and used as probes. the nylon membrane were prehybridized with formamide hybridization buffer for 42°c for  <dig> h, the denatured probe was added, and hybridized for  <dig> h. washed membranes were exposed to x-ray film  and developed after  <dig> days of incubation at -80°c. the image of the developed film was acquired by syngene-g-box gel documentation and analysis system  and signal intensity of each spot was calculated by the gene tool software. transcript levels for each unigenes were calculated as the average intensity from triplicate experiments. the intensity of each spot was normalized with respect to the intensity of actin gene. change in level of expression was expressed as the expression ratio of normalized signal intensities of respective unigenes in control versus treatments. on the basis of macroarray results, genes exhibiting significant induction were validated by northern blotting.

for northern blotting total rna  from ww and ws plants was separated by electrophoresis on a  <dig> % fa agarose gel and transferred to an immobilon™-ny+ membrane  following the method of sambrook et al.  <cit> . pcr-amplified individual cdna fragments  were purified from the agarose gel and used as probes. cdna-amplified actin  was the housekeeping gene control. probes were labeled with α32p-dctp, using the decalabel™ dna labeling kit . northern blots were scanned using a pharosfx plus phosphorimager .

quantitative real-time rt pcr
pcr primers for quantitative real-time pcr were designed with the parameters of optimum primer gc content of 50%, primer tm > 55-65°c, primer length 18- <dig> nucleotides, and an expected amplicon size of 80- <dig> bp . sybr green qpcr was performed in 96-well plates, using the stratagene mx3000p system and sybr fast qpcr master mix  universal . all qpcr reactions were run in triplicates with a no-template control to check for contaminations. pcr was conducted under the following conditions:  <dig> min at 95°c ,  <dig> cycles each of  <dig> sec at 95°c  and  <dig> s at 60°c . finally, a melting curve analysis was performed from 65° to 95°c in increments of  <dig> °c, each lasting  <dig> s, to confirm the presence of a single product and absence of primer-dimers. two internal controls gapdh  and hsp <dig>  were used to normalize the variations in cdna samples  <cit> . fold changes were calculated by the 2-δδct method  <cit> .

RESULTS
water stress treatment
a graph of ntr values of icc  <dig>  icc  <dig>  and  <dig> rils during the stress treatment indicates that all parental lines and rils experienced same degree of stress . the dry down procedure to impose water stress in pot experiments has been successfully employed in various plant systems, including chickpea  <cit> .

considering that terminal drought is a major constraint in achieving optimal crop yields in chickpea, all experiments were conducted at the flowering stage to identify molecular responses of chickpea under water stress. in many functional genomics studies on drought response in chickpea, drought stress has been induced by withdrawing water supply or by uprooting seedlings and allowing them to wilt at room temperature  <cit> . however, the physiologic and molecular responses to these treatments are likely to be different from those experienced by the plant during natural terminal drought conditions, wherein drought stress is gradual and allows the plant to go through various stages of adaptation. another major limitation of all these studies is the variation in the quantum of stress experienced by different plants. depending on their genotype as well as environmental and experimental conditions, plants experience varying degrees of stress when water is withdrawn or they are allowed to wilt for a specified duration. in our study, we sampled icc  <dig> and icc  <dig> and  <dig> rils at a stage when they undergo the same degree of stress, as determined by the transpiration ratio.

cdna ssh libraries
a total of  <dig> clones were generated from the  <dig> ssh libraries, of which  <dig> ests were sequenced. after a quality check,  <dig> high-quality ests were obtained . four ssh libraries were constructed from resistance parent icc  <dig>  in total,  <dig> upregulated and  <dig> downregulated ests were identified:  <dig> upregulated ests from library as1- <dig>  and  <dig> from ar1- <dig> , and  <dig> downregulated ests from as2- <dig>  and  <dig> from ar2- <dig> . in addition,  <dig> reciprocal libraries were constructed using root tissues of icc  <dig> and icc 1882: there were  <dig> upregulated ests from ab1- <dig> in icc  <dig> and  <dig> uprgulated ests from ab2- <dig> in icc  <dig>  furthermore,  <dig> ests were generated from library bulk1- <dig>  and  <dig> from library bulk2- <dig> .

in chickpea, root growth, osmotic adjustment, and stem reserve utilization are associated with drought tolerance. root traits such as biomass, length, density, and depth have been proposed as drought-avoidance traits under terminal drought conditions  <cit> . roots are considered a primary site for stress signal perception, where a signaling mechanism cascade initiates gene expression in response to drought stress. these transcriptional changes can result in successful adaptations, protecting plants against environmental stress  <cit> . the differentially expressed ests identified in our study provide a list of gene regulated in response to terminal drought stress in root tissue of chickpea.

the ssh strategy can be used as an alternative and complementary transcript profiling tool to the genechip microarrays, especially to identify novel genes and transcripts present in low abundance  <cit> . thus, the ssh technology will have more utility in a system where genome sequence information and microarray chip are not available for transcript profiling.

in  <dig>   <dig> ests up- or downregulated by water stress were first identified in chickpea  <cit> . cdna libraries from a drought-responsive genotype in chickpea were constructed and differentially expressed ests were identified using in silico approach  <cit> . ssh libraries have been constructed from chickpea seedling after dehydration stress  <cit>  and between root tissue of  <dig> chickpea cultivars  <cit> . transcriptome analysis by using supersage and high-throughput  <dig> sequencing has generated  <dig>  unique 26-bp tags  from roots of the drought-tolerant chickpea variety icc  <dig>  <cit> . however, absence of a reference sequence for chickpea and the short read length of sequences  limit the utility of this approach.

est assembly
a total  <dig> high-quality sequences  were generated after removing short and low-quality sequences. a total of  <dig> unigenes  were derived from cluster assembly and sequence alignment; each contig had 2- <dig> ests with an average length of the  <dig> bp. the majority of contigs  contained  <dig> or fewer ests, whereas only  <dig> % contigs were made from  <dig> or more ests , indicating a high degree of normalization and subtraction efficiency. all est sequences have been deposited in the dbest division of genbank . the unigene  set developed in this study is henceforth referred to as ug-tds . cap <dig> assembly analysis of our datasets with all chickpea est sequences  deposited in ncbi dbests identified  <dig> unigenes  as singlets and are new entries to the chickpea database.

ests from forward and reverse libraries were aligned to identify unique ests, which were up- or downregulated . there were  <dig> unigenes specific to forward-subtracted libraries and  <dig> unigenes to reverse-subtracted libraries. although  <dig> assemblies contained ests from both forward and reverse libraries, this indicates very low level of redundancy between both libraries . ests identified in bulk libraries and from individual parent libraries were also aligned using cap <dig> assembly, assuming that the high number of ests from the hrb-contributing parent icc  <dig> and bulks of rils of the extreme hrb phenotype would form a cluster. surprisingly, only  <dig> ests were common between icc  <dig> ests and bulks of rils exhibiting hrb. similarly, only  <dig> ests were common for icc 1882-specific transcripts  and the transcripts from bulks of rils exhibiting extremes of lrb phenotype.

to determine the efficiency of normalization and subtraction of ssh libraries, we compared our ests with those generated by using non-normalized cdna libraries. we have previously reported more than  <dig>  chickpea root ests in response to drought and salt stress in icc  <dig> by using the same procedure to obtain tissue samples for constructing the libraries  <cit> . cap <dig> assembly and clustering analysis of ests identified  <dig> contigs with  <dig> est from our ssh libraries and more than  <dig> ests from non-normalized libraries. some ests such as ho <dig> , ho <dig> , and ho <dig> , had single representations in ssh libraries, whereas more than  <dig> clones were present in non-normalized cdna libraries. these results support the utility and efficacy of our ssh approach to reduce the redundancy and identify specific transcripts with small-scale sequencing. dataset analysis with all chickpea est sequences  deposited in ncbi dbests identified  <dig> new unigenes .

nucleotide-level diversity analysis
blastn analysis of ug-tds revealed significant identity with medicago , followed by glycine max , phaseolus , lotus , populus , arabidopsis , and oryza sativa  ests . analysis of sequence similarity of chickpea ug-tds with other legume species revealed that  <dig>  unigenes had significant similarity to ests of at least one of the analyzed legume species, with highest similarity of chickpea unigenes with medicago, which is closely related to chickpea in the phylogenetic tree  <cit> . as expected, the  <dig> leguminous species showed the highest levels of similarity. the low level of sequence similarity for l. japonicus may be because of its est collection is smaller  than those of other species such as soybean  and medicago . the low nucleotide similarity observed between chickpea and other plant species does not necessarily represent phylogenetic relationships, but could depend on the coverage of est sequences. a significant percentage of unigenes  showing weak or no similarity  for medicago, glycine, lotus, and phaseolus, indicating a considerable divergence in chickpea gene content within other leguminous species.

functional characterization of the chickpea unigene dataset
blastx analysis of  <dig> unigenes showed  <dig> total hits against ncbi non-redundant  database with e value <1e- <dig>  a majority  of top matches were from proteins of legume species, with maximum hits from glycine max  and medicago truncatula ; only 6%  matched with cicer arietinum, indicating the novelty of the chickpea unigenes dataset. among nonlegume species, majority of matches were with proteins of vitis vinifera , ricinus communis  and populus trichocarpa . the availability of the whole genome and predicted proteins of these species and limited sequence information of legumes in the database may have led to the highest homology of chickpea sequences with these nonlegume genomes . functional annotation of unigenes by blast2go resulted in gene ontology functional classification terms for  <dig>  sequences, of which  <dig>  unigenes were functionally annotated  and  <dig> sequences were mapped but not annotated . at the second level go,  <dig> sequences were assigned to the biologic process category,  <dig> sequences to the molecular function category, and  <dig> sequences to the cellular component category . in biologic processes, "cellular process" and "metabolic process" was the most dominant term , followed by "metabolic processes" . in the molecular function category, "binding"  was the most dominant term, followed by "catalytic activity" ; in the cellular compartments category, "cell part"  was the most represented term, followed by "membrane-bounded organelle"  and "organelle part" . additional file  <dig> gives details on go analyses of ug-tds sets.

pathway classification of transcripts
of the  <dig> annotated sequences,  <dig> were annotated with  <dig> enzyme commission  codes and mapped to  <dig> different kegg pathways. of the  <dig> pathways contained within the metabolism category ,  <dig> were represented by  <dig> % of the  <dig> unigenes. kegg metabolic pathways well represented by unigenes were biosynthesis of plant hormones , biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids  and terpenoids and steroids , biosynthesis of alkaloids derived from histidine and purine  and from the shikimate pathway , starch and sucrose metabolism , and arginine and proline metabolism . several hormone pathways, such as of abscisic acid, ethylene, salicylic acid, and jasmonic acid, are involved in one or more environmental stresses, including drought stress and other abiotic stresses processes  <cit> . a representative kegg map for biosynthesis of plant hormones is given in additional file  <dig> 

gene ontology  enrichment analysis
identification of overrepresented and underrepresented go terms from a given list of genes from different libraries may help elucidate the functional relevance of these genes under drought stress. go enrichment analysis found that  <dig> go terms were differentially represented between ab1- <dig> and ab2- <dig> :  <dig> were overrepresented and  <dig> underrepresented in ab1- <dig>  several overrepresented terms were associated with stress response properties such as response to salt stress, osmotic stress, abiotic stimulus, radiation, and light stimulus. go terms related to the flavonoid pathway  and peroxidase activity  were underrepresented. the underrepresentation of these go terms suggests downregulation of the flavonoid biosynthetic process and peroxidase activity under drought stress in roots of icc  <dig>  similar results have been reported in barley, chickpea, and mangrove under abiotic stress  <cit> .

go enrichment analysis was also performed between ests derived from the parental genotype library and rils library to determine differential responses between parents and rils. compared with parental genotype libraries,  <dig> go terms were significantly overrepresented in rils bulk libraries . go enrichment analysis of forward-subtracted and reverse-subtracted ssh libraries to determine differential go representation between up- and downregulated est sets  showed overrepresentation of go terms related to stress response properties, such as response to stress, heat, temperature, and abiotic stimulus in the upregulated libraries . three go terms intrinsic to membrane, membrane part, and integral to membrane were underrepresented in the upregulated libraries. these differential enriched go terms related to stress response in upregulated libraries indicate the efficiency of the ssh technique to clone up- and downregulated genes by the forward- and reverse-subtraction methodology. by this analysis, we have a priori-defined gene networks involved in drought stress in chickpea, which can be used to select drought-responsive candidate genes in chickpea.

differential expression analysis of unigenes under drought stress
myoinositol-1-phosphate synthase  and pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase   were upregulated under drought stress . the concentration of pinitol, a cyclic sugar alcohol, is high in halophytic plants and plants adapted to drought  <cit> . mips transcript abundance, and it's content increases in several plant species in response to environmental stresses  <cit> . two mips genes from chickpea camips <dig> and camips <dig> have been isolated and characterized for their role in water stress  <cit> . differential patterns of mips-coding genes occur in maize  <cit> , arabidopsis  <cit> , and rice  <cit> . unigenes p5cs <dig>  and p5cs <dig>  were significantly upregulated under water stress . a significant increase in proline concentrations has been reported in response to water stress in plants and accumulation of proline is considered as an indicator of stress-adaptive response of plants  <cit> .

in our study, different lea groups of genes were found in ug-tds:  <dig> unigenes encoding hva protein ,  <dig> encoding lea proteins ,  <dig> encoding dehydrin , and  <dig> encoding erd proteins . among these lea group  <dig> members  were found highly up regulated in drought stress . earlier studies in chickpea have also reported the induction of lea proteins under drought stress  <cit> . the expression profile of lea genes under stress supports the role of lea proteins as protective molecules that enable cells to survive protoplasmic water depletion  <cit> . studies on overexpression of lea genes also support the protective role of lea proteins by improving the stress tolerance of transgenic plants. expression of the barley gene hva <dig> in wheat and rice increases drought tolerance  <cit> , and overexpression of wheat lea genes pma <dig> and pma <dig> increases dehydration tolerance in transgenic rice  <cit> .

different members of aquaporins subfamilies were found in ug-tds: which includes,  <dig> unigenes encoding plasma membrane intrinsic protein ,  <dig> unigenes encoding tonoplast intrinsic protein   <dig> unigenes encoding nod26-like intrinsic protein . the maximum numbers of the unigenes encoding aquaporin were found in root libraries and downregulation of one of the member  under drought stress was conformed in northern blot analysis . this is similar to downregulation of transcripts and reduction in protein levels of most the arabidopsis aquaporin genes under drought condition  <cit> , which may be an adaptive strategy for plants to minimize water flow through cell membranes and uphold leaf turgor to minimize water loss. in tobacco, ntpip <dig>  and ntpip <dig>  expression is downregulated to reduce osmotic hydraulic conductance in the roots under drought stress  <cit> , supporting the role of aquaporins in drought stress maintenance.

eleven chickpea unigenes from ug-tds were classified as members of the ap2/erf superfamily:  <dig> under the erf family and  <dig> under the rav family. three members of this family  were analyzed by northern blot under drought stress conditions. erf <dig> was downregulated whereas erf <dig> was upregulated under stress conditions. biosynthesis of ethylene and regulation of its activation pathway are important to mediate plant developmental processes and stress responses in plants  <cit> . the ap2/erf family of transcription factors, especially the cbf/dreb and erf subfamily, has been extensively studied in response to drought stress  <cit> . cap <dig>  a member of the chickpea ap <dig> family, is responsive to various abiotic stress and its overexpression in tobacco increases the tolerance to dehydration and salt stress  <cit> . northern blot analysis showed that ug-tds ho <dig> coding for rav  transcription factor was downregulated under drought stress . arabidopsis rav <dig> is a brassinosteroid  down-regulated gene. high level of br is accompanied by a very low level of rav <dig> transcripts and vice versa  <cit> . the involvement of br pathway in the enhancement of tolerance to chilling, thermo, salt, mild drought injury and pathogen attack has been confirmed in several studies  <cit> . therefore, the down regulation of rav during terminal drought stress in our study may indicate the involvement of the br pathway.

in chickpea,  <dig> members of the nac gene family  are strongly induced by drought, salt, cold, and wounding  <cit> . we have identified  <dig> new members of this tf family in ug-tds with one nac gene  that have increased expression under drought stress validated by northern blot result . expression profiling and overexpression analysis of nac genes in several plants supports their involvement in stress tolerance  <cit>  k. nakashima, l.p. tran, d.v. nguyen, m. fujita, k. maruyama, d. todaka, y. ito, n. hayashi, k. shinozaki and k. yamaguchi-shinozaki, functional analysis of a nac-type transcription factor osnac <dig> involved in abiotic and biotic stress-responsive gene expression in rice, plant j.  <dig> , pp. 617- <dig>  full text via crossref | view record in scopus | cited by in scopus .

the hdzip gene  was among the up regulated transcription factor, as reflected from northern blot results. two members of this gene family  have been identified form ug-tds. the functional information available on plant hdzip genes suggest that at list some of these genes are involved in response to different environmental conditions  <cit> . overexpression of sunflower hd-zip gene habt- <dig> confers drought tolerance in arabidopsis  <cit> , this is suggestive of important role of hd-zip protein in regulation of expression of genes involved in drought tolerance.

hypothetical proteins are genes of unknown functions predicted from the arabidopsis or rice genome sequence. two such genes hp- <dig> and hp- <dig> were significantly induced in ws plants. several hypothetical genes have now been characterized by advanced bioinformatics tools by identifying similarity of conserved function domains. for example, in arabidopsis, the family of bag proteins initially annotated as hypothetical proteins are now annotated as bag gene family members, their function as regulators of apoptosis-like processes has also been characterized.

functional characterization of such unknown hypothetical proteins can shed light on the mechanism of drought adaptation in chickpea.

we found transcript levels of the chlorophyll a/b-binding protein to be downregulated during stress. most of the strongly downregulated transcripts were related to photosynthesis, photorespiration, and metabolism of amino acids and carbohydrates. in a dehydration shock treatment, the transcript level of chlorophyll a/b-binding protein remained unchanged  <cit> ; similarly, in barley, chlorophyll a/b-binding protein transcript  levels do not change under dehydration shock treatment but are downregulated by drought stress treatment  <cit> , indicating differential response of genes under dehydration and drought stress.

comparative transcript profiles of icc  <dig> and icc  <dig> under drought stress
to identify differentially regulated transcripts in response to terminal drought stress between drought-tolerant icc  <dig> and drought-susceptible icc  <dig>  ssh libraries ab1- <dig> and ab2- <dig> were constructed. to validate these differentially expressed transcripts, a nylon macroarray, using unigenes from ab1- <dig> and ab2- <dig> libraries, was constructed. total rna from water-stressed icc  <dig> and icc  <dig> was used to assess the genotype-specific response of these genes under drought stress . the unigenes showing at least  <dig> -fold of induction were selected for further analysis .

the normalized expression intensities of unigenes and the results of hierarchical clustering analysis according to their relative expression patterns is graphically represented by a heat map in figure  <dig>  hierarchical clustering resulted in the formation of  <dig> clusters . clusters i and ii included unigenes that were upregulated in icc  <dig>  whereas cluster iii included unigenes downregulated in icc  <dig> as compared with icc  <dig> .

genes in clusters i and ii were associated with metabolic process  and also these genes shown to be involved in drought response in several other plants  <cit> . upregulation of genes involved in ion binding and transport activities  upregulated in icc  <dig> and have been shown to be induced by wounding, salt, and cold stress in other plant species  <cit>  indicates multiple stress induction of these genes. similarly known stress-responsive transcription factors and regulators such as the ap2/erf domain-containing transcription factor , myb transcription factor , dna repair and transcription factor xpb <dig> , and transcription regulators  were also upregulated in icc  <dig>  a similar differential induction of these genes or gene categories in drought-tolerant genotypes in response to drought stress during the reproductive stage has been reported in barley  <cit> .

cluster iii contained unigenes that were upregulated in icc  <dig> but not icc  <dig>  one upregulated unigene encoded fructose-bisphosphate aldolase , whose downregulation could inhibit gluconeogenesis for conserving energy in drought-stressed plants .

to validate the results of dot blot analysis,  <dig> differentially expressed unigenes were analyzed by qpcr. real-time pcr confirmed the differential expression of these genes under terminal drought stress conditions . the genes showing significant differential expression between the  <dig> genotypes can be explored as potential candidate genes that can confer terminal drought tolerance in chickpea, using transgenic overexpression and tilling  analysis.

CONCLUSIONS
we report the sequencing, assembly, and annotation of  <dig> high-quality drought-responsive est sequences from chickpea. this dataset was generated from ssh libraries constructed using drought-tolerant and -susceptible chickpea genotypes and bulks of their progenies exhibiting hrb and lrb phenotypes. ssh libraries allowed cloning genes that are specifically up- and downregulated from the roots and shoots of chickpea in response to terminal drought. moreover, we identified more than  <dig> novel unigenes in chickpea that are associated with terminal drought stress. besides several transcripts coding for known stress-related proteins, several novel genes with unknown functions that may have a potential role in drought tolerance in chickpea were also identified. this study also provides a comparative overview of genotype-specific expression patterns of more than  <dig> unigenes in root tissues of chickpea in response to drought. the up- and downregulation of some unigenes was confirmed by real-time qpcr. the est dataset and the information about transcription of several genes can be useful for the research community and help identify potential candidate genes for drought tolerance in chickpea. our study can also serve as an important resource for developing functional markers, full-length gene isolation, tilling, drought-responsive promoter isolation, and in drought functional genomic studies involving overexpression, e-qtl, and manipulation of drought tolerance in chickpea.
