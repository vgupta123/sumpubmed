BACKGROUND
marine cyanobacteria represent a particularly rich source of structurally novel and biologically active natural products  <cit> . the range in biological activity is vast and includes compounds that disrupt cell division  <cit> , inhibit microtubule assembly  <cit> , inhibit angiogenesis and promote actin polymerization  <cit> , and block  <cit>  or activate  <cit>  sodium channels. marine cyanobacteria produce an array of bioactive secondary metabolites that include peptide, polyketide, terpenoid and alkaloid structures. antillatoxin  is a structurally unique lipopeptide purified from the pantropical marine cyanobacterium lyngbya majuscula  <cit> . blooms of l. majuscula have been associated with adverse effects on human health. these adverse effects include respiratory irritation, eye inflammation and sever contact dermatitis in exposed fishermen and swimmers  <cit> .

atx has been demonstrated to be among the most ichthyotoxic metabolites isolated to date from a marine microalga and is exceeded in potency only by the brevetoxin- <dig>  <cit> . atx has been shown to be neurotoxic in primary cultures of rat cerebellar granule cells  <cit> . this neurotoxic effect was antagonized by both the sodium channel antagonist tetrodotoxin  and the n-methyl-d-aspartic acid  receptor antagonists, mk- <dig> and dextrorphan  <cit> . this profile for atx toxicity in the rat cerebellar granule cells is therefore similar to that of other voltage-gated sodium channel  activators such as brevetoxins  <cit>  suggesting that vgscs may serve as a molecular target for atx. direct evidence for atx interaction with vgsc was derived from the demonstration of stimulation of batrachotoxin binding and sodium influx by atx in cultured neurons  <cit> . the precise recognition site for atx on the vgsc, however, remains to be delineated.

characterization of the four atx stereoisomers  has revealed that the preferred stereochemistry for the neuropharmacologic actions of atx is the -isomer  <cit> . in addition to its stereochemistry, the twisted side chain of atx has also been demonstrated to be important for its toxicity in neuro-2a mouse neuroblastoma cells. two atx analogs, 8-demethyl-antillatoxin and 8-demethyl- <dig> -dihydro-antillatoxin  were shown to be respectively 244- and 27-fold less potent than atx in producing toxicity in neuro-2a mouse neuroblastoma cells  <cit> .

vgscs are responsible for the rapid influx of sodium that underlies the rising phase of the action potential in electrically excitable cells including neurons. sodium channels are composed of voltage-sensing and pore-forming elements in a single protein complex of one principal α-subunit of 220- <dig> kda and one or two auxiliary β-subunits which alter the channel physiological properties and subcellular localization  <cit> . presently, nine functional vgsc α-subunit isoforms have been described, giving rise to nine sodium channel subtypes termed nav <dig> -nav <dig>   <cit> . vgsc subtypes can be discriminated pharmacologically based on their sensitivity to ttx. nav <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  are sensitive to low nanomolar concentrations of ttx whereas nav <dig>  and  <dig>  are relatively insensitive to ttx with ic <dig> values in the low micromolar range. nav <dig>  is resistant to a concentration of  <dig> μm ttx. the expression of sodium channel α-subunits is tissue-dependent. nav <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  α-subunits are primarily expressed in the brain, skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle, respectively  <cit> . vgscs represent the molecular target for a broad range of potent neurotoxins that bind to at least six distinct receptor sites on the sodium channel α-subunit and affect the two major properties of sodium channels, namely ion permeation and gating  <cit> . due to their high affinity and specificity, these neurotoxins serve as important tools to explore the structure and function of vgscs.

in this study, we characterized the action of atx on heterologously expressed rnav <dig> , rnav <dig>  and rnav <dig>  α-subunits by measuring sodium influx using a sodium-sensitive fluorescent dye, sodium-binding benzofuran isophthalate . we found that atx displayed unique efficacy as compared to other reference vgsc activators, veratridine and brevetoxin- <dig> , in heterologously expressed rnav <dig> , rnav <dig>  and rnav <dig>  α-subunits. these data demonstrate that atx displays unique pharmacological properties in cells heterologously expressing vgsc α-subunits.

RESULTS
atx produces sodium influx in heterologously expressed rnav <dig> , rnav <dig>  and rnav <dig>  α-subunits
we have previously demonstrated that atx is a sodium channel activator with an undefined recognition site on the vgsc  <cit> . recently, atx has also been demonstrated to stimulate sodium influx in neocortical neurons with a high efficacy comparable to that of the neurotoxin site  <dig> agonist, batrachotoxin and the neurotoxin site  <dig> agonist, pbtx- <dig>  <cit> . to further characterize this structurally novel toxin, we examined the influence of atx on sodium influx in heterologously expressed rnav <dig> , rnav <dig>  and rnav <dig>  α-subunits. in preliminary experiments we established that atx was not toxic to these cell lines heterologously expressing sodium channel α-subunits . as depicted in figure  <dig>  atx produced a rapid and concentration-dependent sodium influx in rnav <dig> -chl  <dig>  rnav <dig> -hek  <dig> and rnav <dig> -chl  <dig> cells. in contrast neither veratridine, a sodium channel neurotoxin  <dig> activator nor pbtx- <dig>  a neurotoxin site  <dig> agonist, were capable of stimulating sodium influx in cells heterologously expressing these sodium channel α-subunits . the concentration-response relationships for atx-induced sodium influx in rnav <dig> -chl  <dig>  rnav <dig> -hek  <dig> and rnav <dig> -chl  <dig> cells depicted in figure  <dig> indicate that the potencies for atx did not differ significantly. the ec <dig> values for atx in rnav <dig> , rnav <dig>  and rnav <dig>  expressing cells are listed in table  <dig>  the maximal response for atx-induced sodium influx in rnav <dig> -chl  <dig> cells was somewhat greater than that in rnav <dig> -chl  <dig> and rnav <dig> -hek  <dig> cells . the rank order of maximal response for atx-stimulated sodium influx was rnav <dig> -chl  <dig> > rnav <dig> -hek  <dig> > rnav <dig> -chl  <dig> 

atx produces minimal sodium influx in wild type hek  <dig> and chl  <dig> cells
to demonstrate that the sodium influx observed in response to atx exposure was a consequence of activation of rnav <dig> , rnav <dig>  and rnav <dig>  α-subunits, we examined the influence of atx in the hek  <dig> and chl  <dig> parent cell lines. atx produced minimal sodium influx in both hek  <dig> and chl  <dig> cells . these data therefore indicate that the atx-induced sodium influx observed in cells stably expressing vgsc α-subunits was primarily a consequence of activation of rnav <dig> , rnav <dig>  and rnav <dig> . the marginal sodium influx induced by atx in wild type hek  <dig> likely resulted from activation of endogenously expressed sodium channels  <cit> . although there are no reports of the expression of sodium channel α-subunits in chl  <dig> cells, our data suggest that these cells may also express low levels of endogenous sodium channel α-subunits.

ttx antagonism of atx-induced sodium influx in rnav <dig> -chl  <dig>  rnav <dig> -hek  <dig> and rnav <dig> -chl  <dig> cells
to further confirm the role of rnav <dig> , rnav <dig>  and rnav <dig>  α-subunits in atx-induced sodium influx, we examined the influence of ttx on the response to atx. ttx pretreatment produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of atx-induced sodium influx in rnav <dig> -chl  <dig>  rnav <dig> -hek  <dig> and rnav <dig> -chl  <dig> cells with ic <dig> values of  <dig>  nm ,  <dig>  nm  and  <dig>  μm , respectively . these inhibitory potencies of ttx are consistent with the expected sodium channel pharmacology in that rnav <dig>  and rnav <dig>  are ttx sensitive with ic <dig> values in the nanomolar range whereas rnav <dig>  is relatively insensitive with an ic <dig> value in the low micromolar range  <cit> .

relative densities of rnav <dig> , rnav <dig>  and rnav <dig>  α-subunits expressing cells
given the modest differences in the maximal responses for atx in rnav <dig> -chl  <dig>  rnav <dig> -hek  <dig> and rnav <dig> -chl  <dig> cells, we performed a whole-cell btx binding assay to determine the relative density of these sodium channel α-subunits, which may contribute to the distinct maximal response for atx action. assuming equivalent btx affinities for rnav  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , a single radioligand concentration may be used to estimate the relative densities of binding sites. btx is a selective probe for neurotoxin site  <dig> on the vgsc α-subunits  <cit> . this ligand interacts preferentially to the active or open conformation of the channel, and the specific binding is sensitive to conformational changes induced by the binding of neurotoxins at other sites on the sodium channel α-subunit. inasmuch as the specific binding of btx is dramatically increased by the allosteric effects of deltamethrin and brevetoxin, we performed the btx binding assay in the presence of these positive allosteric modulators. the specific binding of btx  to cells expressing either rnav <dig> , rnav <dig>  or rnav <dig>  α-subunits indicated that rnav <dig>  had the highest expression level  followed by rnav <dig>   and rnav <dig>   . the maximal sodium influx evoked by atx paralleled these relative densities of vgsc α-subunits . these data indicate that the modest difference in maximum responses to atx in the three cell lines is primarily a function of the relative densities of α-subunits.

positive allosteric interaction between atx and pbtx- <dig> binding sites on the rnav <dig>  α-subunit
atx binds to an undefined site on the sodium channel α-subunit and this site is allosterically coupled to neurotoxin sites  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . to examine the allosteric interaction between the atx binding site and neurotoxin site  <dig> in rnav <dig> -hek  <dig> cells, we evaluated the concentration-response relationships for pbtx- <dig> to stimulate sodium influx in the absence or presence of  <dig> nm atx. while pbtx- <dig> alone had no effect on sodium influx, in the presence of a subthreshold concentration of atx  pbtx- <dig> concentration-dependently increased sodium influx in rnav <dig> -hek  <dig> cells . to ascertain the reciprocal nature of this positive allosteric interaction, we also examined the influence of a fixed concentration of pbtx- <dig>  on atx-induced sodium influx in rnav <dig> -hek  <dig> cells. pbtx- <dig> , which alone had no effect, significantly increased the maximal response to atx-induced sodium influx from an area under the curve  value of  <dig>   to  <dig>   . these data demonstrate a balanced positive allosteric interaction between the atx binding site and neurotoxin site  <dig> 

dh-atx is a partial agonist in cells expressing rnav <dig> , rnav <dig>  and rnav <dig>  α-subunits
dh-atx is a recently synthesized atx analog  <cit> . dh-atx produces toxicity in neuro-2a neuroblastoma cells with an ec <dig> of  <dig>  μm, which is less potent than atx in the same system  <cit> . to expand the structure-activity relationship information for this analog, we examined the effects of dh-atx on the stimulation of sodium influx in rnav <dig> -chl  <dig>  rnav <dig> -hek  <dig> and rnav <dig> -chl  <dig> cells. dh-atx produced concentration-dependent stimulation of sodium influx in all three cell lines, and was  <dig>  - 4-fold less potent than atx . additionally, the maximal response of dh-atx on sodium influx was lower than that of atx in cells expressing rnav <dig> , rnav <dig>  and rnav <dig>  α-subunits . these data demonstrate that dh-atx acts as a partial agonist in cells heterologously expressing sodium channel α-subunits. the ec <dig> values and relative efficacy for dh-atx stimulation of sodium influx in cells expressing rnav <dig> , rnav <dig>  and rnav <dig>  α-subunits are listed in table  <dig> 

atx and dh-atx produce ca2+ influx in deaa-hek  <dig> cells
sodium channel cation permeability is intimately related to the conserved motif of four amino acid residues located near the outer vestibule of the pore. these residues form the deka locus in sodium channel α-subunits. native na+ channels are virtually impermeable to ca2+. mutation of the conserved lys  residue in domain iii to ala ,  produces a channel that is permeable to ca2+  <cit> . we used cells expressing the rnav <dig>  deaa mutation to explore the influence of sodium channel activators on ca2+ influx. atx produced a robust and concentration-dependent ca2+ influx with an ec <dig> value of  <dig>  nm  that was similar to its potency on sodium influx in rnav <dig> -hek  <dig> cells. the atx analog, dh-atx stimulated ca2+ influx with an ec <dig> value of  <dig>  nm . the relative efficacy for dh-atx-induced ca2+ influx was  <dig>  which was similar to its relative efficacy in stimulating sodium influx in native rnav <dig>  cells . again, these data demonstrate that dh-atx is a partial agonist in cells expressing vgsc α-subunits. similar to the lack of response on sodium influx in rnav <dig> -hek  <dig> cells, veratridine and pbtx- <dig> were all without effect on the stimulation of ca2+ influx in deaa-hek  <dig> cells .

discussion
antillatoxin is a structurally unique lipopeptide characterized by a large number of methyl groups, including a rare tert-butyl group  <cit> . atx binds to a site on the sodium channel α-subunit that remains to be defined and stimulates sodium influx in cerebellar granule and neocortical neurons  <cit> . veratridine is a steroid-derived alkaloid purified from the plant liliaceae family. veratridine specifically interacts with neurotoxin site  <dig> and preferentially binds to the activated state of sodium channels. veratridine produces persistent channel activation by inhibiting sodium channel inactivation and shifting the voltage dependence of activation to more negative potentials  <cit> . pbtx- <dig>  a lipid soluble polyether neurotoxin, is produced by the marine dinoflagellate karenia brevis. pbtx- <dig> specifically binds to neurotoxin site  <dig> of sodium channel α-subunits and shifts the activation potential to more negative values and inhibits channel inactivation  <cit> .

in the present experiments, we demonstrated that atx produced an efficacious stimulation of sodium influx in heterologously expressed rnav <dig> , rnav <dig>  and rnav <dig>  α-subunits. although whole-cell patch-clamp is an elegant and useful method to study ion channel function with temporal resolution capable of tracking the millisecond kinetics of activation and inactivation, the low throughput of such electrophysiological methods precludes comprehensive assessment of concentration-response relationships as reported in the present study. the sbfi fluorescence method used in our study provided a robust and homogeneous cell population measurement. our results indicate that atx acts by binding to the α-subunit of neuronal, cardiac and skeletal muscle sodium channels. atx also produced robust stimulation of ca2+ influx in the mutant deaa-rnav <dig>  expressing cells. atx has similarly been shown to be a high efficacy sodium channel activator in neocortical neurons  <cit> . the resting membrane potential for hek  <dig> cells is relatively depolarized   <cit> . at this depolarized resting membrane potential most rnav <dig>  channels will be in the inactivated state. the efficacious response for atx on sodium influx in rnav <dig> -hek  <dig> cells suggests that atx may either alter the voltage dependence of inactivation or augment the rate of recovery from inactivation. it is also possible that atx may interact preferentially with the inactivated state of vgsc α-subunits. an inactivated state dependency has been demonstrated previously for the ability of β scorpion toxin to modify vgsc function  <cit> . depolarizing stimuli have also been shown to enhance the binding of β scorpion toxin to neuronal cells  <cit> . these earlier observations demonstrate precedence for preferential interaction of neurotoxins with the inactivated state of vgsc α-subunits.

in contrast to the efficacy of atx on sodium influx in cells expressing rnav <dig> , rnav <dig>  and rnav <dig>  α-subunits, we found that veratridine and pbtx- <dig> were without significant effect when administered alone. these toxins were also without effect on the stimulation of ca2+ influx in deaa-rnav <dig>  expressing cells. in neocortical neurons we have previously demonstrated that veratridine and pbtx- <dig> produce sodium influx with respective efficacies of  <dig>  and  <dig>   <cit> . the higher sodium channel expression levels in neurons may partly account for these differences in the efficacies of veratridine and pbtx- <dig>  <cit> . whereas neurons and hek cells  <cit>  express sodium channel β-subunits, chl  <dig> cells do not  <cit> . sodium channel β-subunits regulate sodium channel α-subunit function at multiple levels including mrna expression, channel stabilization/trafficking and direct channel modulation  <cit> . the β <dig> subunit has been shown to alter toxin sensitivity of vgsc α-subunits reconstituted in phospholipid vesicles  <cit> , but not in cho-k <dig> cells  <cit> . the role of the absence of the vgsc β <dig> subunit in the lack of effect of veratridine and pbtx- <dig> on sodium influx in cells expressing rnav <dig>  and rnav <dig>  α-subunits remains to be determined. the ability of atx to stimulate sodium influx in these cell lines is, however, clearly not dependent on the expression of the vgsc β <dig> subunit. in this regard it is noteworthy that modulation of vgsc function by β scorpion toxin does not depend on the presence of the sodium channel β <dig> subunit  <cit> ).

among these cell lines expressing α-subunits, we demonstrated that atx was somewhat more potent  at the skeletal muscle  and cardiac  than in the neuronal rnav <dig> . the maximal response for atx-stimulated sodium influx in rnav <dig> -chl  <dig> cells was modestly higher than in rnav <dig> -chl  <dig> or rnav <dig> -hek  <dig> cells. the whole cell btx binding assay, however, demonstrated that these distinct maximal responses were related to the relative sodium channel α-subunit expression levels in these cell lines.

dh-atx is an atx analog, which is less potent than atx in producing toxicity in the neuro-2a mouse neuroblastoma cell line  <cit> . we have demonstrated that the ability of dh-atx to produce sodium influx was also less potent than atx in cells expressing rnav <dig> , rnav <dig>  and rnav <dig>  α-subunits. additionally, we have demonstrated that the efficacy of dh-atx in the stimulation of sodium influx was lower than that of atx in these cells. a similar profile of both lower potency and relative efficacy was observed when measuring ca2+ influx in deaa-hek  <dig> cells. these data demonstrate that the twisted side chain of atx is important for the interaction with sodium channel α-subunits. lipid-soluble toxins at neurotoxin sites  <dig> and  <dig> have been shown to affect channel gating  <cit> . catterall has provided evidence that the site  <dig> toxins batrachotoxin, aconitine and veratridine act as full or partial agonists  <cit> . we have previously demonstrated that a group of site  <dig> ligands, including both naturally occurring and semi-synthetic brevetoxin analogs, produce distinct maximal responses on sodium influx in neocortical neurons  <cit> . the lower efficacy of dh-atx relative to atx suggests that the partial agonism observed previously for neurotoxin site  <dig> and  <dig> ligands generalizes to the atx site on vgsc α-subunits.

the lipid-soluble toxins acting at neurotoxin receptor sites  <dig> and  <dig> have been characterized as allosteric modulators of sodium channel function  <cit> . these toxins bind at topologically distinct sites that favor the open state of the sodium channel and display complex allosteric interactions. atx has been demonstrated to allosterically stimulate btx binding in cerebellar granule cells  <cit> . this enhancement can be further augmented by pbtx- <dig> suggesting a positive allosteric interaction between neurotoxin site  <dig> and the atx site  <cit> . in the present study we demonstrated that a subthreshold concentration of atx significantly potentiated pbtx-2-induced sodium influx in rnav <dig>  α-subunit expressing cells. pbtx- <dig> also significantly augmented atx-induced sodium influx in these cells. these data therefore directly demonstrate the reciprocal nature of the allosteric interaction between the atx binding site and neurotoxin site  <dig>  this is consistent with the free energy conservation principle for the simultaneous binding of two allosterically coupled ligands in which the binding of ligand a produces upon the binding of ligand b the same effects that the binding of ligand b produces upon the binding of ligand a  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we demonstrate that atx displays a unique efficacy with respect to stimulation of sodium influx in cells expressing rnav <dig> , rnav <dig>  and rnav <dig>  α-subunits. the efficacy of atx was distinctive inasmuch as it was not shared by activators of neurotoxin sites  <dig> and  <dig>  it is possible that, similar to β scorpion toxin interaction with neurotoxin site  <dig>  atx may interact preferentially with the inactivated state of vgsc α-subunits. we have also demonstrated that the atx binding site shares with neurotoxin sites  <dig> and  <dig> the phenomenon of partial agonism. finally, we observed a reciprocal allosteric interaction between neurotoxin site  <dig> and the atx binding site. collectively, these data indicate that atx is a sodium channel gating modifier with unique efficacy in cells heterologously expressing vgsc α-subunits. defining the molecular determinants and mechanisms of action of atx may provide further insight into the gating properties of sodium channels.
