BACKGROUND
a wide variety of bioinformatics tools are available to assist in studying gene-gene, gene-protein, protein-protein, and protein-metabolite associations that control cellular functions in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes  <cit> . with technologies capable of producing high-throughput data at transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic levels, one has opportunities to accelerate the process of mapping global gene activities into networks and linking them with their corresponding phenotypic features  <cit> . in this study, a novel statistical approach was experimented on human breast cancer gene expression arrays, and the estrogen receptor α  transcriptional activities were the main focus.

in studies using time course microarray data, correlation analysis continues to serve as one of the most frequently adopted methods in identifying co-expressed gene sets  <cit> . for independent array experiments from patient tissues, association analysis also plays an important role in discovering relationships between transcription factors and their regulated genes  <cit> . it has been shown in those studies that the profile similarities present in co-expressed genes and the association observed in between transcription factors and their direct target genes are usually statistically significant and can be easily detected by correlation measures that aim at identifying linear or partial linear association. however, for the association that cannot fit linear models well, which may be commonly observed in biological systems, less attention has been made due to fewer methods available in measuring such type of association patterns. an alternative approach is to employ non-linear methods that deal with discrete distributions by binning strategy. in this regard, coefficient of determination  and mutual information  have been proposed to find associated gene pairs  <cit> .

since  <dig>  a new measure of association, the coefficient of intrinsic dependence , has been introduced to be applicable for microarray analysis in classification and prediction of cancers at molecular level using clinical gene expression arrays  <cit> . cid is designed to uncover the dependency present in between the target  and the predictor  by comparing distributions of the target under different values of the predictor. in this study, cid was further tested in its utility for constructing transcription factor directed regulatory networks using clinical breast cancer gene expression arrays. the statistical analysis conducted in this study reveals the potential of using cid incorporated with correlation test to identify er-regulated gene sets in silico and then to construct a two-layer regulatory network based on clinical breast cancer gene expression arrays.

we first use three gene lists to evaluate the power of cid in identifying er-regulated genes. the first list  contains a set of genes with expression mechanisms mainly driven by direct binding of erα to estrogen response element  in the promoter regions  <cit> . the second and third lists are retrieved from a recent study that provided potential primary  and secondary target genes  of erα based on experiments of a cell culture model mcf- <dig>  <cit> . to clarify the contribution of employing cid in detecting er related genes, we simultaneously include galton-pearson's correlation coefficient   <cit> , student's t test   <cit> , coefficient of determination   <cit> , and mutual information   <cit>  when analyzing our patient arrays  with cid. two types of information are used as the predictor  when identifying er-regulated genes. the first one is the mrna expression level of the gene esr <dig>  and the second one is the protein level status of erα. in the analysis of using mrna levels, gpcc shows promising ability of finding er direct targets . on the other hand, when applied on discrete variables , cid shows similar performance as compared to stt , and detects more tf-target associations in gene set iii than cod and mi . moreover, cid reveals its advantage of discovering indirect or partial linear association on continuous variables  . this suggests cid's application on construction of large-scale regulatory network, where we can include more functional transcription factors of interest even if their protein level statuses are not experimentally determined.

in the end, this study shows how information derived from different data sources  and learning algorithms  can be put together to investigate whether the relevant transcriptional regulatory mechanisms built in cell models can be partially re-identified in the given breast cancer systems . thus, one can attempt to use this knowledge to gain a greater understanding of the breast cancers and uncover ways toward more rational adjuvant hormone therapy for those patients.

RESULTS
statistical identification of erα associated genes in 48a
thirty three genes  are experimentally proved to have ere site at the promoter regions by others  <cit> . they are analyzed for the relationships with erα in our cohort  by different statistical tests. the main focus of this study is to investigate whether the association between a transcription factor  and its target genes  can be detected based on expression profiles. in other words, in absence of the protein status, the statistical method is expected to discover the association between the regulators and their targets based only on the mrna levels of both genes, measured simultaneously in a single experiment. in this regard, statistical methods that deal with continuous variables in both of the conditioners and the targets are the main focus. this includes cid-esr <dig>  gpcc-esr <dig>  cod-esr <dig>  and mi-esr <dig> . to show the difference in results when protein level information is adopted, we access the er status for each patient sample and conduct association analysis by applying statistical methods dealing with discrete variables as the predictors, including cid-er, stt-er, cod-er, and mi-er . the results are summarized in tables s2–s <dig> of additional file  <dig> 

here, we first report the results using mrna levels of esr <dig> as the variable x. among the  <dig> genes analyzed, only four genes  are consistently detected  by all the four tests;  <dig> genes  are ranked as significance  by at least one of the four statistical tests . this indicates that different methods have their preferences in detecting different types of tf-target association patterns based on their gene expression distribution patterns in a given population . among the  <dig> genes significantly identified by at least one test, cid-esr <dig> claims  <dig> genes as significance. the same number of genes is identified by gpcc-esr <dig>  both cid-esr <dig> and gpcc identify more genes than the other two methods. the intersection information between any two methods is summarized in figure s3a of additional file  <dig>  next, for the analyses based on er status, five genes  are consistently detected by all the methods;  <dig> genes  are ranked as significance by at least one of the four methods . in this case, cid-er identifies the most number of genes  among the four tests. below we use two examples  to explain why these tf-target gene associations can be discovered by cid-esr <dig> and/or cid-er.

cid is designed to measure association between two genes of interest by evaluating the distribution pattern diversity of target gene expressions among patient subgroups, which are partitioned based on the predictor gene expressions in ascending order. here, two genes, brca <dig>  and ccna <dig> , are used to illustrate the general interpretations for association measured by cid. the scatter plot of brca <dig> versus esr <dig> mrna levels is shown in figure 4a accompanied with the result of gpcc, which is not significant . this plot indicates a mixture of linear and non-linear relationships between esr <dig> and brca <dig>  it has been discussed that the promoter region of brca <dig> gene might be responsive to estrogen stimulation in both direct and indirect ways  <cit> . the indirect model suggests other transcriptional regulators to bind the promoter region before gathering active erα to form a complex. as the result, it regulates brca <dig> expression via either increasing or decreasing mrna levels in a synergistic manner   <cit> . if without the influence from some of regulators, erα differentially up or down regulates brca <dig> mrna expression via a basal activity of transcriptional mechanism, by which the concentration of all the essential components of transcriptional machine determine the proportional changes of target gene expression levels . thus, brca <dig> is erα target gene following both linear and non-linear relationships which were seen by cid . cid aims at discovering observations of brca <dig> that clustered together given a certain range of expression levels of esr <dig>  intuitively, if the expression levels of brca <dig> are clustered when given low expression of esr <dig>  one yields high prediction power on the expression levels of brca <dig>  the red points in figure 4a, for example, indicate one would observe brca <dig> having expression level between - <dig> and - <dig> with high probability when the expression level of esr <dig> is within the range . accordingly, figure 4b shows the red subgroup contributes the most to the cid value .

we further use ccna <dig>  as an example to illustrate how cid detects remote association between a tf and its target genes. figure 4c–f describe the association between ccna <dig> and erα being evaluated by examining the relative mrna levels of ccna <dig> against the mrna  levels of esr <dig>  in different subgroups.  through a series of evaluations directed by cid, the clustered subgroup in red is analyzed to be the major contributor  to cid-esr <dig>  stt is designated to measure the difference of means between groups, which are labelled with red dashed lines in figure 4e. a significant mean difference has been claimed by stt . on the other hand, cid measures not only the difference of means but the diversity of generally distributional patterns. the differential clustering patterns of ccna <dig> expression in er as compared to er is measured by cid-er with significance .

to further clarify the difference among cid and other statistical methods, we use other two gene lists  to demonstrate that different methods may have their own strengths in detecting erα target genes through primary and non-primary mechanisms. the results have been shown in table s <dig> and s <dig> of additional file  <dig>  besides, the intersection information between any two methods is summarized in figure s3b-c of additional file  <dig>  in figure  <dig>  we show the selecting power of these tests by plotting the accumulated number of identified known target genes versus the number of top-ranked genes reported . figure 1a shows that gpcc outperforms the other tests in finding erα direct targets . however, in figure 1c, gpcc loses its advantage in detecting erα regulated genes through non-primary mechanisms . in figure 1b, the performance of all the tests is similar . meanwhile, as shown in figure 1d, stt demonstrates its ability in detecting erα non-linear association when provided with er+/- status. though cid does not outperform the other methods when using er+/- status, it is shown in figure 1c that cid presents its favourable ability of discovering remote association based on continuous mrna expressions, which reveals its own role in large scale analysis where immunohistochemical status of gene products cannot be always generated.

combining cid and gpcc in constructing transcriptional regulatory network
different statistical methods have their own uniqueness , and we have shown in the previous subsection that gpcc has its strength in detecting erα primary targets. meanwhile, cid is shown to have preference over gpcc in detecting association between transcription factors and their non-primary downstream genes. while cid shows similar performance with stt in discovering both primary and non-primary association between tfs and the regulated genes when given categorical distributions, cid has the advantage over stt in detecting downstream genes of transcription factors based on only mrna expression values. this indicates cid to be a new measure of association which has its own role in uncovering tf-target relationships as compared to gpcc and stt. three methods do share common and different preferences in measuring tf-target association. thus, we hypothesize that a combined analysis would be desirable for discovering a range of tf-target associations in order to take advantage of the strength from different measures. in this subsection, we use an example to explain how cid can be incorporated with gpcc to discover association between regulators  and the regulated genes , which have been translated as essential links to build a transcriptional regulatory network. since protein-level information is not always available in gene expression array analysis, stt is not included in the following example of application.

first, we use time course gene expression profiles on mcf- <dig> upon estrogen treatment  <cit>  to compile a list of  <dig> potential estrogen responsive genes by trajectory clustering  <cit>  . among the selected genes,  <dig> probes  were successfully matched in our microarray 48a by gene names. both gpcc-esr <dig> and cid-esr <dig> are performed on these  <dig> candidate probes, resulting in three distinct groups listed in table  <dig>  the first group contains  <dig> genes, which are detected by gpcc-esr <dig> and thus considered as the potential er-regulated genes. it is observed that thirteen genes  in this group is found in gene set ii . this ratio  is considerably much higher than random guess .

# the number of genes in 48a appeared in gene set ii.

&the number of genes in 48a appeared in the gene list of e2f family direct target by others  <cit> .

the  <dig> genes in the second group shown in table  <dig> are reported to be significantly associated with the mrna levels of esr <dig> by cid-esr <dig>  but not by gpcc-esr <dig>  it is observed that some of the genes in this group are target genes of e2f family members. for example, ccne <dig> and pcna are previously reported to be regulated by e2f <dig>  and ccna <dig> is found to be mainly targeted by e2f family but is also as one of erα target genes  <cit> . in this regard, we apply a further gpcc test on those  <dig> genes versus each of the e2f family members appeared in our microarray, including one probe of e2f <dig>  e2f <dig>  e2f <dig>  e2f <dig>  e2f <dig>  and e2f <dig> and two probes of e2f <dig>  in addition, gpcc-esr <dig> is performed on each e2f member to validate the association between esr <dig> and e2f members in our array data . as shown in figure  <dig>  only three activators e2f <dig>  e2f <dig>  and one probe of e2f <dig> show significant dependency on esr <dig> by gpcc in our cohort. among the  <dig> genes in the second group,  <dig> of them  are found significantly correlated with at least one of the expression levels of e2f <dig>  e2f <dig>  or e2f <dig> 

it is worthy of notice that some of essential relationships in a transcriptional regulatory network in general  <cit>  are found in figure  <dig>  for instance, nine of them  have been reported as e2f target genes in another study  <cit> , and fignl <dig> is predicted as a novel e2f1-inducible gene in  <cit> . among the  <dig> genes in this group, only two of them  do not show their dependency with any e2f members, and thus are not shown in figure  <dig> 

we wonder if we can conclude that most genes in the first group in table  <dig> are estrogen responsive genes through the primary mechanism and the second group through non-primary mechanism involving other regulators. as discussed previously, among the  <dig> genes of gene set ii,  <dig> genes are found in the first group, but only one gene is found in the second group. furthermore, we observe that, among the tested  <dig> genes,  <dig> of them are e2f target genes reported in  <cit> . as shown in table  <dig>  seven of the  <dig> e2f target genes fall in the second group, but only one is found in the first group. the differential characteristics of the first group  and the second group  reveal the advantage of incorporating cid with gpcc in constructing regulatory network. finally, it is observed that some previously annotated relationships   <cit>  are falling in the third group . thus, they are speculated as not being significant in our cohort. some gene expression relationships in figure  <dig> are unknown relationships and deserve to be further investigated by in vitro studies.

interestingly, ccna <dig>  ccne <dig>  and pcna show being down-regulated in our breast cancer cohort. it indicates the suppressive expression of those identified genes regulated by erα mediated transcriptional activities, which is opposite to that in the estrogen treated mcf- <dig> model  <cit> . it has been discussed previously that erα transcriptionally regulates e2f <dig> expression via indirect tethering mechanism  <cit> . in the presence of estrogen, e2f <dig> is the major transcriptional regulator and/or the co-regulator of genes mediating cell cycle in vitro  <cit> . therefore, we reason that upon estrogen exposure erα suppressed e2f <dig> mrna expression in our cohort. the research evidence also support e2f <dig> may being a major transcription factor of ccna <dig>  ccne <dig> and pcna upon estrogen exposure  <cit> . as a consequence of erα suppressive effect on the gene expression of e2f <dig> in er population of 48a, we conclude that erα suppresses the mrna expression of ccna <dig>  ccne <dig>  and pcna mainly via e2f <dig>  at least in part.

one drawback for cid is that it does not tell whether it is positive or negative association when a subject gene is considered statistical dependent to the query transcription factor. in this regard, gpcc is suggested to supply the required information. finally, we conclude that the example shown in figure  <dig> reveals the possibility of efficiently constructing regulatory network for scientists to generate more hypotheses based on statistical tests. in this paper, we consider only one regulator x at a time to examine whether it is related to the expression levels of the regulated gene y. in molecular systems, however, it is commonly observed that multiple regulators  simultaneously govern the behaviour of y. by definition, cid is ready to be extended to measure associations between multiple predictors  and the target . how to construct a more realistic network by integrating such multivariate associations identified by cid deserves further studies.

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed a methodology for extracting a transcriptional regulatory network in a high-throughput gene expression data set. first, a new measure of association cid is demonstrated to provide additional information to other traditional tests. second, a small example is employed to illustrate that how estrogen responsive genes with similar expression profiles can be first retrieved based on time course experiments and then the structure of network can be discovered by association analysis combing gpcc and cid. we conclude this statistical approach to be novel and it facilitates the process of drawing a statistically relevant network in a given population.
