BACKGROUND
type- <dig> diabetes mellitus  is a rapidly increasing disease with more than  <dig> million afflicted persons worldwide . t2dm poses a huge burden for the health care systems and is, thus, subject to intensive biomedical research. t2dm is a multigenic disease involving a high number of susceptibility genes and causes alteration of an entire network of genes. several environmental and nutritional risk factors have been identified for t2dm the most relevant being obesity where multiple molecular mechanisms have been proposed to link obesity to insulin resistance and beta cell failure  <cit> . increased availability of food and reduced physical activity as a consequence of modern lifestyle are the main drivers for an anticipated epidemic increase in t2dm patients in the next years.

in the pathopysiology of t2dm, impaired insulin sensitivity and glucose intolerance are early phenomena, leading to hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and, eventually, to a failure of pancreatic beta cells to produce and secrete a sufficient amount of insulin. however, most genes and their associated molecular network contributing to the onset and course of the disease are yet unknown.

genetic variation in the context of diabetes has already been extensively studied, leading to numerous candidate genes. studies on transgenic and knock-out mice have been valuable to dissect the regulatory network of genes implicated in insulin action and body weight control  <cit> , however, monogenic variants contribute only to a minority of t2dm cases. in contrast, the polygenic nature of t2dm is now well established and several polygenic mouse models including nzo, btbr etc. have been studied to analyze diabetes susceptibility on a more complex genetic background  <cit> . linkage analyses have shown that several quantitative trait loci interact with each other and with the environment to elicit obesity syndromes that are potentially diabetic. several recent genome-wide association studies have identified novel candidate genes for t2dm but the effect of these variants on disease susceptibility is generally low, with odds ratios mostly around  <dig>   <cit> .

multiple studies on the transcriptome level have been performed that emphasize the diversity of the disease and the complex pathophysiological interactions between different tissues, including fat, muscle, liver, pancreatic beta cells and brain  <cit> . in several human studies, tissue biopsies from diabetic and normoglycaemic individuals have been profiled  <cit> . in mouse studies differences in diet or mouse strains have been used to identify distinct expression profiles  <cit> . complementary chip-on-chip studies reveal the associated gene regulatory network of important transcription factors  active in the relevant tissues  <cit> . in the context of the onset of diabetes, several studies on the proteomic level have revealed differential expression of intracellular proteins as well as of secretory proteins in adipose tissue  <cit> . despite the availability of these large amounts of data, their common content as well as their specific differences, in particular in gene sets between human and rodent studies, has not yet been systematically evaluated.

the goal of this meta-analysis approach is to generate additional value by combining the above-mentioned individual studies and by extracting consistent information. several meta-analyses studies have been previously applied within other disease domains, such as cancer  <cit>  or alzheimer  <cit>  using different types of data. with respect to t2dm some recent approaches have been published: in tiffin et al. several computational prediction methods have been combined in order to identify a common set of t2dm genes  <cit> . the authors assessed the accordance of the prediction methods resulting in a candidate gene list of  <dig> different genes. for type- <dig> diabetes mellitus a web-resource has been set up that tracks the expression behavior of genes in several tissues  <cit> . liu et al. have applied enrichment analysis to previously defined gene sets and protein-protein interactions using data from different species and tissues from the diabetes genome anatomy project  <cit>  and identified a subnet of insulin signaling proteins and nuclear receptors  <cit> . in contrast to rhodes et al., sun and liu et al. our approach is not limited to transcriptome studies  <cit> . we have accumulated data from different levels of molecular interaction such as genetic information using knock-out mice and single nucleotide polymorphisms , gene regulatory and gene expression information as well as information on protein signaling and protein interactions. in order to reduce technical bias of transcriptome measurements we restricted this data type to experiments that were performed on the affymetrix genechip platform. similar to liu et al., we combined the relevant tissues such as liver, muscle, adipose tissue and pancreas  <cit>  since t2dm has physiological consequences in several parts of the body. furthermore, a more global view on t2dm has been achieved by involving mouse as well as human data because the available mouse models address specific aspects of the disease and it is unclear, whether these mice have diabetes for the same reason as humans do.

using a bootstrap  <cit>  scoring approach we computed a core set of  <dig> genes that show significant disease relevance in the data sets under study. here, we used the gene expression profiles along with qualitative data comprising literature, genetic and proteomic sources. besides known genes our approach exhibits a large fraction  of yet barely characterized novel candidate genes. these genes have been further validated in the functional context of networks and exhibit high potential for understanding pathways and pathway crosstalk associated with t2dm. by applying gene set enrichment analyses we inferred the deranged parts of the physiology using gene ontology terms  <cit> , common pathway resources  <cit>  and information on the associated gene regulatory network  <cit> .

the meta-analysis approach is generic and can be used as a template for studies in other disease domains. it has been completely implemented in the software platform r using the bioconductor package collection  <cit> . our t2dm-geneminer web resource  <cit>  allows the user to access the information that was gathered and to assess diabetic potential for any human or mouse gene of interest.

RESULTS
we present the identification of the t2dm candidate genes, the comparison to previously published t2dm gene lists and results from association and linkage studies as well as the identification of associated molecular networks on different levels.

annotation, preprocessing and categorization of data
we used ensembl  as the annotation reference database. homology between human and mouse genes was derived via biomart. the total number of genes under study comprises  <dig>  ensembl mouse genes representing the union of the homologue genes from all data sources. an overview about the t2dm specific datasets is given in table  <dig> 

several of the available resources are based on microarrays. each individual microarray study was normalized using the gc rma method of the r/bioconductor package  <cit> . recently, it has been reported that the remapping of the oligoprobes, as an alternative to the annotation given by the chip provider, enhances data analysis to a significant extent  <cit> . using this mapping we indeed observe differences in annotation resulting from recent changes in genome annotation. annotation comparisons showed improvement of reproducibility and specificity . re-annotation affects the main fraction of genes, for example in the remapped mouse genome u74a version  <dig> platform the top ten genes of our candidate list are represented by oligoprobe sets of  <dig> to  <dig> probes  with an average of  <dig> probes .

identification of t2dm candidate genes – generality versus specificity
numerical scores were computed for all genes in each individual study, the scores were summarized and the summarized scores were compared against a random sample at the  <dig>  percentile as described in materials & methods. this procedure determines a cut-off score value of  <dig>  and identifies a set of  <dig> genes with a score exceeding this cut-off.

randomly, we would expect  <dig> out of the  <dig>  genes to exceed the threshold. cutting at the  <dig> percentile results in  <dig> genes , cutting at the  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> percentiles would result in  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> selected genes . thus, the ratio of detected vs. expected significant genes increases with percentile of the random sample from  <dig>  to  <dig> , indicating a necessary precondition for the validity of our selection procedure . since we have analyzed data from multiple tissues in human and mouse, it is likely that for some cases an individual experiment is dominating the score, for example, if the gene is active only in a single tissue. in order to identify those genes we have computed an entropy-based numerical criterion . entropy is high if many experiments contribute equally to the overall score, it is low if a single  experiment accounts for a large fraction of the score. for example, the gene serpina1b has the top score  in our study. this is due to a very high fold-change in a single experiment; consequently, entropy is low . in contrast, other genes show more consistent alterations across many different studies, for example pdk <dig>  indicated by higher entropy . differential expression of pdk <dig>  a major regulator of glucose metabolism, has been found in fat, pancreatic islets and skeletal muscle but not in liver.

the thirty genes with highest scores are listed in table  <dig> .

adiponectin  has a score of  <dig>   and the high entropy indicates a consistent behavior across data sets. adipoq is a hormone from adipocytes that modulates insulin sensitivity and thus regulates glucose and lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. expression of adipoq is reduced in obesity, certain genotypes are associated with increased risk of t2dm in humans  <cit> . the protein is secreted from fat tissue and has insulin-sensitising and anti-inflammatory properties. additionally, we find strong changes in the expression in muscle both in human and mice. adipoq is an oxidative regulator. the systemic oxidative stress causes the metabolism to share the burden from fat to muscle  <cit> . adipoq is also responsible for the crosstalk between the three kegg pathways 'ppar signaling', 'adipocytokine signaling' and 'type ii diabetes mellitus'. it has been tested for transcriptional regulation but no binding to the tfs under study could be detected. a negative regulation has been described for tnf that has not been tested in the underlying studies.

pdk <dig> phosphorylates and inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase complex thereby contributing to the regulation of glucose metabolism. expression of this gene is regulated by glucocorticoids, retinoic acid and insulin. this is in accordance with a consistent differential expression in fat, muscle and pancreatic islets resulting in high entropy. on the other hand, possible regulation of the gene by hnf4a and usf <dig> is reported in liver.

hydroxysteroid  dehydrogenase  <dig>  is a critical enzyme for cortisol metabolism. hsd11b <dig> is increased in obese subjects and transgenic mice over-expressing hsd11b <dig> develop visceral obesity  <cit> . inhibition of hsd11b <dig> decreases blood glucose in hyperglycaemic mice. selective antagonists are currently developed and tested as anti-obesity and anti-diabetes drugs.

scd <dig>  is the rate-limiting enzyme in monounsaturated fatty acid synthesis. it has been shown to exert a critical role in hepatic lipogenesis and lipid oxidation. scd <dig> knock-out mice are lean due to increased energy expenditure, show increased insulin sensitivity and are resistant to diet-induced obesity and liver steatosis.

nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase  is a mitochondrial enzyme involved in proton transport into the mitochondrial matrix. nnt was identified as a novel candidate gene in a quantitative trait locus for glucose intolerance  <cit> . nnt has been recently shown to regulate insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells. nnt deficiency results in defective insulin secretion and inappropriate glucose homeostasis  <cit> . it has been proposed that nnt detoxifies reactive oxygen species  <cit>  implicating a possible role of nnt in regulating atp production in mitochondria and function of the atp sensitive k+ channel kir <dig>   in insulin producing beta cells.

for eighteen genes only limited functional information is available as a basis for assessing a possible relationship to t2dm: ccrn4l, serpina <dig>  htatip <dig>  mest, pgcp, tmsb4x, angptl <dig>  mrpl <dig>  ndfip <dig>  yipf <dig>  tmem30a, asnsd <dig>  oact <dig>  larp <dig>  thrsp, 1810015c04rik, 2310003f16rik, and 2610002j02rik. high genetic variation is known for pgcp in mouse. serpina <dig>  a target of hnf4a, is massively changed in liver and 1810015c04rik in pancreatic islets. using the entropy criterion we observe medium to high entropy in these genes, like in ndfip <dig> , what points to the fact that high scoring of these genes was not due to single outlier experiments but that these genes are truly affected by the disease and, thus, exhibit a high potential for further functional experiments.

t2dm-geneminer web tool
in order to allow users to screen the disease potential of any given gene of interest we developed t2dm-geneminer, a web interface summarizing the results of our work . the user interface is shown for the well-known adipoq and the resulting bar plots for two other genes, pdk <dig> and cfd, with lower content of available information. the resource is searchable by gene or protein ids . the score distribution is shown as a bar plot and, where available, functional information is displayed. the two rightmost bars show the entropy, indicating uniform or specific score distribution, and the score. the red line at the score bar indicates the cut-off.

overlap to previous predictions of t2dm genes
from fourteen genes in the omim description of t2dm  five genes have a significant score in our study: retn, gpd <dig>  vegfa, irs <dig> and tcf <dig> . retn represents an adipocytokine which has been implied to play roles in obesity, diabetes, and insulin resistance  <cit> . interestingly, retn is only deregulated in one of two studies involving adipose tissue. in contrast, differential expression for irs <dig>  vegfa and tcf <dig> was observed in pancreatic islets whereas gpd <dig> did not show tissue-specific expression. several previous studies have already published t2dm candidate lists allowing us to assess common content. the overlap to the list of the diabetes genome anatomy project  <cit> , being also the source of some of the transcriptome data sets used for this meta-analysis  <cit> , results in a p-value of  <dig> e- <dig>  using the same resource, with a less conservative selection of data sets, liu et al. identified  <dig> genes related to insulin signaling with an overlap of seven genes to our candidate list containing several strongly connected proteins   <cit> . more selective is a review of sequencing candidates leading to a p-value of  <dig> e- <dig>  <cit> . in tiffin et al.  <dig> candidates were published as partial overlap of several electronic candidate prediction methods  <cit> . this results in a p-value of  <dig> e- <dig> comparing it with our list . in summary, the t2dm candidate gene list includes a small amount of candidate genes from previous studies and, further, leads to an additional set of  <dig> genes not identified in the other studies. subtracting those genes for which we have disease information from the incorporated reviews our approach identifies  <dig> novel t2dm candidate genes.

relation to monogenic mouse models for t2dm
a variety of genetic studies have been performed in the last decades. at least nineteen genetically engineered mouse models with t2dm phenotype have been studied in detail  <cit> . of those, five genes show a significant score in our meta-analysis: slc2a <dig>  irs <dig>  ptpn <dig>  slc2a <dig> and irs <dig>  consistent with previous reports, the insulin-regulated glucose transporter glut <dig>  is down-regulated in the insulin resistant state in adipose tissue but not in skeletal muscle. likewise, down-regulation of irs <dig> and the glucose transporter glut <dig>  in pancreatic islets confirms previous reports and reflects deterioration of beta cell function in the course of insulin resistance and diabetes.

on the other side slc2a <dig> is also changed in liver. ptpn <dig> is expressed in all tissues showing only small fold-changes. several genes from omim or ko-mice do not change at all on the expression level. this indicates that only the complete loss of the associated protein alters the system whereas the gene's expression is not altered in t2dm. for ko-mice we also see a strong tendency to genes only expressed in mice.

relation to human and rodent association and linkage studies
recently, a total of nine candidate genes for t2dm have been identified and replicated in humans through multiple genome-wide association studies of common variants by using high-density snp mapping approaches: cdkal ,cdkn2a /cdkn2b , fto , hhex , igf2bp <dig> , kcnj <dig> , pparg , slc30a <dig> , and tcf7l <dig>   <cit> . interestingly, none of these genes shows a high score in our meta-analysis, although pparg and tcf7l <dig> are significant on the less restrictive  <dig>  level. on the other hand, from the data we could infer that fto and hhex act in pancreatic islets indicated by the t2dm-geneminer result for these genes. cdkal <dig> and cdkn2a are not expressed in the transcriptional studies. these genes show very low expression levels or might be active in tissues not included in our study. since our meta-analysis approach takes into account several data sets from dna microarrays, our candidate genes have a bias towards transcripts whose expression is changed in the context of t2dm. moreover, the gene variants from association studies may not result in altered gene expression and, for most snps found in association studies, there is a lack of functional information since the variation mostly occurs in non-coding regions of the genes. in order to correlate the t2dm genes with genetic variation we plotted the number of known snps for the genes . no general tendency to highly variable genes is observable. two genes of the candidate list show high variation, pgcp  and sorbs <dig> . particularly interesting is pgcp, because it has not been related to t2dm before and its functional role is also undetermined.

a further issue of our study was the chromosomal localization of the t2dm genes. the marker genes are scattered over the entire mouse genome . using the hypergeometric distribution on local sliding windows across the chromosome we could identify significantly enriched chromosomal regions. however, none of these regions convinced since they are sparsely occupied. for example on chromosome  <dig> with  <dig>  genes and  <dig> t2dm candidates, a window of  <dig> genes containing two t2dm candidates leads to a p-value of  <dig> . none of the windows of  <dig> genes contained more than three candidates. rather conversely, we observe that t2dm affects a wide range of physiological phenomena spanning loci in the entire genome.

assessing functional annotation with enrichment analyses
enrichment analyses based on the hypergeometric distribution were carried out in order to assess whether our t2dm candidate list is over-represented with respect to a certain functional category . categories on the physiological level comprise three major pathway resources   <cit>  and the go tree  <cit> . altogether, we have analyzed  <dig>  gene sets, whereof  <dig>  are significant with a p-value below  <dig>  .

as greater parts of the metabolism are affected by t2dm, multiple pathways have a significant enrichment p-value. for example, in kegg  <dig> out of  <dig> pathways have a p-value lower than  <dig> . table  <dig> shows the results of pathways with a p-value lower than  <dig> e- <dig>  results for different pathways are not independent. for example, the  <dig> genes annotated with 'insulin signaling pathway' and the  <dig> genes annotated with 'type ii diabetes mellitus' share  <dig> genes. the first four pathways help to validate our significant gene set. 'ppar signaling', 'adipocytokine signaling' and 'insulin signaling pathway' are well related to t2dm.

all are the genes under consideration, sig the number of candidate genes, set is the number of genes in the pathway under study and sigset the overlap of genes in the pathway and the candidate genes. p-values were computed with the upper tail of the hypergeometric distribution indicating the probability of observing this overlap by chance. q-values are the multiple testing corrected p-values  <cit> .

since we used several pathway resources in parallel, we can compare the findings for consistency, assuming the resources are independent. for example, we found enrichment of the kegg pathway 'fatty acid metabolism' what is complemented by the biocyc pathways 'fatty acid elongation – saturated', 'fatty acid elongation – unsaturated' and by the go categories 'positive regulation of fatty acid biosynthesis', 'positive regulation of fatty acid metabolism', 'fatty acid binding' and 'fatty acid oxidation'. the kegg pathway 'complement and coagulation cascades' is complemented by the reactome pathways 'initial triggering of complement', 'complement cascade' and the go categories 'defense response' and 'complement activation, alternative pathway'.

for  <dig> t2dm gene candidates there is information on the associated biochemical pathways according to the kegg database. whereas most genes  are associated with a single or a few  pathways, some genes exhibit a higher interconnection such as mapk <dig> , pik3r <dig> , aldh9a <dig> , mapk <dig> , sh3glb <dig> , pla2q12a , pkm <dig>  nfkbia, dhrs <dig>  actb . the importance of mapk <dig>  pik3r <dig>  rasa <dig> and socs <dig> is also supported by liu et al. as members of an insulin signaling subnet derived from protein-protein-interactions  <cit> .

in order to identify crosstalk between pathways we scored the pathways according to their counts and their overlap in the t2dm candidate list . an important module with a large number of genes represented in the t2dm list and a high overlap is visible with the pathways "insulin signaling", "type ii diabetes mellitus", "ppar signaling", "adipocytokine signaling", and "fatty acid metabolism" pointing to the interplay between obesity and insulin resistance. another path of signaling action is activation of the ras/raf/mek mapk cascade resulting in cell growth and gene expression alterations expressed by the crosstalk between "type ii diabetes mellitus" and "mapk signaling" pathways.

t2dm-related protein-protein interactions
protein-protein interactions have been taken from the intact database denoting the number of interactions and interactors registered for the t2dm candidate genes. the ratio of interactors to interactions indicates whether the protein participates in big complexes or binds with single proteins. figure  <dig> shows the number of interactions and the score for the genes under study. there is no trend for preferential selection of highly interacting genes in our t2dm candidate list. the high-scored genes comprehend a few genes with many interactions like mapk <dig>  pik3r <dig> and rela in mouse with more than  <dig> interactions. the large number of interactions of mapk <dig> and pik3r <dig> is consistent with their participation in many of the signaling pathways . actb, cltb, hspa <dig> and grn have more than  <dig> interactors, indicating big polymers. in human tsc22d <dig>  tnfrsf1b, ndrq <dig> and nme <dig> have most interactions. lmna is the only gene with more than  <dig> interactors.

mapping the interactions on ensembl genes and coerce the human net and mouse net we derive a graph with  <dig>  nodes and  <dig>  edges . if we consider the edges between significant genes and their non-significant nearest neighbors we still have  <dig>  nodes and  <dig>  edges. this shows that the disease genes strongly interact with main physiological triggers and deregulate essential parts of the metabolic network. reducing the interactions on the  <dig> t2dm genes we end up with  <dig> nodes and  <dig> edges .

t2dm-related gene regulatory network
in order to study the information content of the set of selected disease genes on gene regulation, we have analyzed a) the tfs present in our significant set and b) known target sets of tfs for enrichment. analysis is often hampered because tfs are known to be expressed at a very low level and fold changes are commonly low. moreover, many tfs are regulated by phosphorylation  and/or ligand binding . as a result, important core regulators including onecut <dig> , hnf4a , tcf <dig> , and foxa <dig>  are not in our candidate list.

collecting tfs from odom et al.  <cit> , transfac  <cit>  and the go category go: <dig> in mouse and human with evidence codes ic, imp, tas or ida we identify  <dig> tfs. thereof  <dig> tfs received a high score in our t2dm set: srebf <dig>  tcf <dig>  rela, ybx <dig>  cebpb, nr1d <dig>  klf <dig>  nfil <dig>  ccrn4l, atf <dig>  nme <dig> and drap <dig>  srebf <dig> and ybx <dig> are expressed only in mouse but in every tissue. cebp's and srebp's are important regulators of lipid metabolism and adipogenesis and were found differentially expressed in the course of insulin resistance and t2dm. consistent changes could be identified in the tissues under study . pparg is expressed solely in fat where its expression is altered. in total, target sets of  <dig> tfs have been investigated as gene sets for enrichment analysis. table  <dig> shows the tfs from odom et al.  <cit>  with significant p-value. for example, cebpa is highly significant. it is expressed in adipose tissue and modulates the expression of leptin. cebpa shows some correlation with the level of hyperglycemia in  <cit> . alteration is also observable in liver.

the target sets with a p-value below  <dig>  are displayed as an extract . column identifiers as in table  <dig> 

a gene regulatory network comprising the regulatory interactions of the significant genes and the significant and enriched tfs is shown in figure  <dig>  obvious are the five hubs, the core regulatory circuit derived from  <cit> . well-regulated candidates can be identified like acly and fabp <dig>  target and regulator at the same time is ipf <dig> 

discussion
the first part of our study was devoted to the identification of genes related to t2dm using different heterogeneous data sources in different organisms. genes have been scored in each individual study according to their disease relevance and an overall score across the different studies has been computed that reflects their total disease relevance. by this approach we were able to identify  <dig> genes that have a general disease relevance showing high scores in many different studies as well as genes that have a specific disease relevance expressing high scores in only a few studies.

in the second part of this work the computed t2dm gene set has been used to identify biological networks on different layers of cellular information such as signaling and metabolic pathways, a comprehensive gene regulatory network and protein-protein interactions.

biological validity of the t2dm candidate set is assessed with a comparison to existing studies and disease gene repositories such as omim and genome wide association studies . the union of the medical reviews  <cit> , genetic sources  <cit>  and the pubmed hits  <cit>  contains  <dig> genes with an overlap of  <dig> genes  to our candidate genes. however, at present only a few genes have been identified through gwa in humans  <cit> . since the contribution of most of the known risk alleles to the development of type  <dig> diabetes is rather small, one might conclude that many additional genetic factors are still unknown. therefore, and since there is no unambiguous set of candidates that defines truly positive disease genes in a polygenic context, our analysis may provide guidance for future systematic investigation of candidate genes and further validation studies. nevertheless, variants of pparg and tcf7l <dig> have been consistently found in recent gwa for t2dm and appear to be moderately significant in our meta-analysis as well.

it should furthermore be noted that gwa studies themselves show only little overlap. two recently published meta-analysis studies on gwa  <cit>  have an overlap of a single gene, pparg, which is significant at the  <dig>  level in our study.

our scoring approach is very general. it combines genome-wide transcriptional studies from the affymetrix genechip platform for obesity-induced t2dm, selective previous knowledge as well as gene lists derived from the biomedical literature.

in the study at hand each resource has the same weight in the computation of the score. the entire method, however, could be tuned towards a certain focus by introducing weights and computing weighted scores with weighted random background distributions, for example, if one is particularly interested in a certain tissue or in a certain cellular level of information . in order to weight the fold changes derived from transcriptome data we have used the information on the reproducibility of the signals  and the information whether the gene is expressed in the study samples or not. we have found that this weighting procedure improves results in comparison to simple fold changes because, for example, genes that are not expressed in the study samples might also show high – but senseless – fold changes adding additional noise to the procedure. alternative weights could be introduced by taking into account the genetic variation as number of snps, or the degree in the protein-protein interaction network to separate major players from redundant genes following the hypothesis, that key factors have to be well-connected.

in our approach we include both, genes with low but consistent expression changes across the different studies as well as strongly differentially expressed genes with respect to a single study. we used entropy as an indicator for measuring generality and specificity of a candidate gene with respect to the different studies. the correlation between the score and the entropy is  <dig>  . however, most of our t2dm genes have high entropy and, thus, contribute to expression changes in many of the experiments.

despite these major sources of variation, there are further differences in analyzing microarray data with respect to chip platform and probe annotation. we have used the remapped probe annotation as provided by the r/bioconductor software  <cit>  which results in different sizes of the probe sets so that results can be different when using the annotation of the chip provider.

to assess the reliability of using mouse and human gene expression data we have compared the datasets from the two species separately. this analysis has to be stratified for the tissues under study. for human the data sets include skeletal muscle and pancreas. if we reduce mouse data to the same two tissues and perform the score evaluation on the two species separately we end up with  <dig>  genes in total in the intersection and a correlation of  <dig>  between the two score vectors. the human meta-analysis generates  <dig> significant genes and the mouse meta-analysis  <dig> genes. the overlap has  <dig> genes: abcc <dig>  adipoq, gck, irs <dig>  irs <dig>  irs <dig>  ptpn <dig>  slc2a <dig>  lpl, pik3r <dig>  tcf <dig>  retn, serpine <dig>  rbp <dig>  b2m.

a common approach in meta-analyses is to apply the same statistical test to congeneric studies and combine the resulting p-values by the fisher method or z-score. we found this not practicable in our case, since the experimental sources are too heterogeneous. an extension to the web tool may open the way to introduce weights, chosen by the user.

to contrast the different data sources a correlation heatmap is provided . in order to measure the dependency of the scoring method on published data – particularly review papers – we computed the correlation of the scores derived from the qualitative and quantitative data. the correlation is  <dig>  indicating that the transcriptome data is rather independent of the published review knowledge. in the 'qualitative' category of our study, comprising reviews/omim, knock-out models and pubmedgenerif  <cit> , we find  <dig> genes to be related with the disease. only a small proportion  of those genes were also found in our t2dm candidate list, so that the computed scores do not replicate literature knowledge to a dominating extent. this does not mean that our results lead to completely different results. using a leave-one-out cross-validation with these studies we measured the significance of the overlap of each of these studies with our candidate list. this overlap can be quantified with the p-value derived from the upper tail of the hypergeometric distribution  <cit> . for all of the 'qualitative' reference sets we computed highly significant p-values .

many existing t2dm data sets have not been incorporated in this study. for example, all transcriptome studies that were conducted on other microarray platforms than affymetrix have been discarded because of compatibility issues. with the recent progress in merging gene expression data this limitation is soon questionable. furthermore the selected data sets have a certain bias towards obesity-induced t2dm what is somewhat justified since obesity is a major risk factor. however, our study can be easily extended with additional sources of t2dm-relevant information. on the genetic level the results of qtl studies or, in human, association studies would upgrade the genetic component of the meta-analysis. likewise to the omim source a sequence change does not necessarily lead to detection by expression change or a different criteria used in the study. e.g. a misfolded protein is not identifiable in this approach.

furthermore, valuable information would be results from proteomic or metabolomic studies, but unfortunately data is still very sparse. although the meta-analysis approach detects disease and candidate genes, it fails for some very specific well-known candidates. if a gene is only active at a medium level in only one tissue it will hardly be in our list. for example, pparg  is mainly expressed in fat tissue. our general approach with a restrictive cut-off favors genes with either a consistent or a very strong alteration. however, with a less restrictive cut-off at the  <dig> -quantil of the score we retrieve most of the known genes, but would increase the number of false positives to a high extent.

a simple enrichment analysis based on the hypergeometric distribution has been applied in order to characterize the t2dm set on the network level including pathways, regulatory networks and protein-protein interactions. in general, we find a high consistency of the results of the enrichment analysis when screening different databases. for enrichment we used a hypergeometric test and multiple testing corrections based on q-values to keep the results comparable between the different databases. alternative approaches might be useful if focusing on specific annotation. particularly, for the go database this approach does not take into account the specific graph structure. furthermore, there is no unique structure available in the pathway databases. here, for example up- or downregulation of the involved genes and control of the fluxes are important features and could be used to stratify the enrichment.

protein-protein interactions are still very sparse or derived from high-throughput experiments with low overlap and low reproducibility so that results have to be carefully cross-checked. for example, we find a protein complex arising from one experiment of collins et al.  <cit>  with vague relationship to t2dm in the network of the candidate genes.

the gene regulatory network associated with the t2dm candidate set is generic in the sense that all interactions are displayed regardless whether the genes are expressed in a specific tissue or not. this network can be tuned towards tissue specificity by taking into account tissue-specific gene expression and other characteristics. using tissue expression data sets  <cit>  we can assess the representation of the different tissues in our t2dm candidate list. a total of  <dig> genes from the list are included in the tissue expression panel  <cit> , where  <dig>  are expressed in fat,  <dig>  in muscle and  <dig>  in liver. an intersection of 31% is expressed in all three tissues .

there are further limitations in analyzing gene regulatory networks. information of tf binding sites – besides computationally predicted sites – is sparse and the knowledge on target sets of tfs is limited. in table  <dig> the p-values for six target sets of regulators are listed that have been derived from chip on chip data. the chip on chip data might also help characterizing the  <dig> unknown t2dm genes as being potential tf targets. the overlap between this uncharacterized subset and the tf target sets are: hnf4a  <dig> genes, foxa <dig>  <dig> genes, usf <dig>  <dig> genes, tcf <dig>  <dig> genes, creb <dig>  <dig> genes and onecut <dig>  <dig> genes. however, this technique is still error-prone and generates a lot of false positive targets due to the different steps in the experiment. commonly, we end up with large targets sets containing thousands of genes  <cit> . here, new methods of computational analysis that combine chip on chip-predicted targets with sequence analysis of their promoter regions have to be developed.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified a core set of  <dig> t2dm candidate genes by a meta-analysis of existing data sources. we have explored the relation of these genes to disease relevant information and – using enrichment analysis – we have identified biological networks on different layers of cellular information such as signaling and metabolic pathways, gene regulatory networks and protein-protein interactions.
