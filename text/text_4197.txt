BACKGROUND
micrornas  are small non-coding rnas  that can downregulate protein synthesis at the post-transcriptional level by generally base-pairing with the untranslated regions  including, but not limited to, the 3′ utrs of corresponding target messenger rnas 
 <cit> . thousands of mirnas have been identified or predicted in eukaryotes and their viruses since the first mirna was shown to regulate development in the nematode caenorhabditis elegans
 <cit> . the first evidence that mirnas play a key role in insect metamorphosis was reported in  <dig>  based on the inhibition of metamorphosis in the cockroach blattella germanica by using rna interference  to silence the dicer- <dig> ribonuclease, which is known to transform pre-mirnas into mature mirnas
 <cit> . the identification and functional characterization of mirnas is an emerging discipline in biological research, but the consequences of disrupting mirna expression are difficult to predict because individual mirnas can ultimately modulate the synthesis of hundreds of proteins if they target mrnas encoding regulatory proteins such as transcription factors. therefore, it is unsurprising that many studies provide evidence for a causal link between the altered expression of individual mirnas and human diseases including cancer, developmental abnormalities and malfunctions of the immune system
 <cit> . although the role of mirnas in vertebrate immunity is well established, there are few studies addressing the immunity-related functions of mirnas in insects, as summarized in a recommended recent review
 <cit> .

here we screened directly for mirnas in the greater wax moth galleria mellonella, focusing on genes that are differentially expressed during development or in response to pathogens that are ingested or breach the integument. the larvae of this species have become established as a classical model host for the analysis of pathogenesis, particularly the virulence factors produced by entomopathogenic viruses, bacteria, fungi and protozoa. g. mellonella has been successfully used as a powerful and reliable model host for human pathogens because it offers an inexpensive and ethically acceptable alternative to mammalian hosts in preclinical research
 <cit> . furthermore, g. mellonella is an efficient whole-animal high-throughput system for the in vivo testing of antibiotics and as a source of novel leads for the development of anti-infectives
 <cit> .

to compensate at least in part for the lack of a complete genome sequence, we have recently described a comprehensive transcriptomic database
 <cit>  that has been exploited successfully e.g. to identify genes that are induced in response to infection with listeria monocytogenes
. this gram-positive bacterium causes the food-borne disease listeriosis in humans, which often results in fatal brainstem infections leading to meningitis and meningoencephalitis
 <cit> . furthermore, we have introduced g. mellonella as a model system to investigate the role of epigenetic mechanisms that modulate insect development and immunity, e.g. the role of histone acetylation in the regulation of transcriptional reprogramming during metamorphosis and infections
 <cit> . this mechanism exerts its effects prior to transcriptional initiation because the acetylation of histones increases dna accessibility and promotes gene expression, whereas the removal of acetyl groups has the opposite effect. in this study, we identified g. mellonella mirnas that may contribute to post-transcriptional gene regulation during metamorphosis and in response to infection. to maximize the synergy between these investigations, we isolated total rna from g. mellonella at the corresponding developmental stages and following infection with the same entomopathogens such as m. anisopliae.

several approaches can be used to screen for mirnas in insects. for example, large scale solexa sequencing was used to identify mirnas in the lepidopteran bombyx mori, which has a completed genome sequence
 <cit> . we designed a microarray imprinted with probes representing  <dig> insect mirna sequences deposited in mirbase  because we have successfully applied this microarray-based approach to identify differentially-expressed mirnas related to systemic bacterial infections or environmental stresses such as heat or starvation in the model beetle tribolium castaneum
 <cit> . microarrays provide a cost-efficient method for the high-throughput analysis of mirnas, and using the same experimental approach again ensures comparability between our most recent dataset and those published in earlier reports. however, in addition to screening for differentially-expressed mirnas, we have also predicted the corresponding target mrnas using both empirical  and theoretical  hybridization) approaches.

RESULTS
microarray analysis of g. mellonellamirnas expressed during metamorphosis and entomopathogenic fungal infections
we investigated mirna expression during metamorphosis and fungal infection by designing a dna oligonucleotide microarray containing  <dig> arthropod mirna sequences from mirbase v <dig>  the database includes unique mirna probes from model insects with complete genome sequences available, such as the silk worm bombyx mori , the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster , the mosquito anopheles gambiae , the red flour beetle tribolium castaneum , the honey bee apis melifera  and the pea aphid acyrthosiphon pisum . all probes comprising novel and conserved mature mirnas from different model insect species were printed in duplicate for signal verification . additional information regarding sample preparation and analysis can be found in additional file
 <dig>  the mirna expression levels in the test samples were compared to those in untreated last-instar larvae. taking this developmental stage as a reference, we found  <dig> and  <dig> mirnas  that were differentially expressed in pre-pupae and pupae, respectively. furthermore,  <dig> mirnas were expressed in pupae relative to pre-pupae. infection of last-instar larvae with the entomopathogenic fungus m. anisopliae resulted in the differential expression of  <dig> mirnas. statistical tests described in additional file
 <dig> were used to select  <dig> mirnas in pupae, pre-pupae and infected last-instar larvae that showed significant differential expression  with differences of up to 14-fold compared to naive last-instar larvae . we utilized mirna sequences deposited in the mirbase database as a reference and classified among the  <dig> significantly differentially expressed mature mirnas  <dig> as novel and  <dig> as conserved based on sequence homology. after removing duplicates of conserved mirnas we identified of  <dig> mirnas in pre-pupae,  <dig> mirnas in pupae and  <dig> mirna in m. anisopliae infected larvae which are differentially expressed .figure  <dig>

mirnas. the microarray heat map was generated following microarray hybridization, statistical analysis and hierarchical clustering. the heat map highlights a set of differentially-expressed mirnas  compared to the expression levels in untreated last-instar g. mellonella larvae.



among the  <dig> significantly modulated mirnas, we found that  <dig> were specific for pupation,  <dig> were specific for pre-pupation and  <dig> were expressed in both the stages . we found that dps-mir-210b was significantly overexpressed following fungal infection and during metamorphosis. the transformation of last-instar larvae into pre-pupae and pupae ultimately resulted in the significant upregulation of  <dig> and  <dig> mirnas, respectively, and the significant downregulation of  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . seven pupae-specific mirnas were upregulated and three were downregulated compared to the expression levels observed in pre-pupae . infection with m. anisopliae suppressed the expression of dps-mir-210b relative to naive last-instar larvae . two-factorial anova confirmed the expression of g. mellonella mirnas that were specific for metamorphosis and entomopathogenic fungal infection .figure  <dig>

mirna target prediction
in the absence of a complete g. mellonella genome sequence, we used our comprehensive transcriptomic database to predict the putative targets of selected differentially-expressed mirnas
 <cit> . nucleotide sequences at the 3′ end of individual contigs lying outside confirmed orfs were considered to be potential 3′ utrs, and were aligned with the mature mirna sequences . this approach enabled us to determine multiple mrna targets for at least  <dig> mirnas, with gene ontologies
 <cit>  as summarized in additional file
5: table s <dig>  we used an independent blast search to detect mrnas in other invertebrate species that matched those we had identified in g. mellonella, in order to investigate the potential functional conservation of mirnas among model insects .figure  <dig>

we validated our mirna–mrna target assignments using the rnahybrid program, which predicts multiple potential binding sites for mirnas in large target rnas. briefly, the program finds the energetically most favorable hybridization sites for mirnas in a corresponding mrna sequence, while eliminating intramolecular hybridization i.e. base pairing between target mrna nucleotides or between mirna nucleotides
 <cit> . the software indicated that complete seed sequence complementarity preceded mirna–mrna duplex formation thus confirming the targets we identified. we found  <dig> mirna–mrna duplexes using this approach, including ame-mir- <dig> , api-mir-263a , ame-mir-263b  and dps-mir-210b , shown as examples to highlight the significant overexpression during pupation, pre-pupation and fungal infection. duplex formation by the other significantly modulated mirnas was also confirmed utilizing the rnahybrid software .figure  <dig>

the majority of the modulated mirnas were found to target the transcriptional machinery, and mrnas related to metabolism and antimicrobial responses . for example, dps-mir-210b was downregulated by fungal infection, and targeted mrnas encoding rna-binding motif protein 8a, transmembrane protein  <dig>  1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase and quiescin sulfhydryl oxidase. similarly, ame-mir-263b was specifically induced in pupae but not pre-pupae, and targeted mrnas encoding dead box polypeptide  <dig> and cd27-binding protein isoform  <dig> .

mirnas regulate the expression of target mrnas during metamorphosis and infection
we next carried out rt-pcr experiments against selected mirnas and their predicted targets to confirm the microarray and bioinformatics results discussed above. we found that ame-mir- <dig> and api-mir-263a were strongly upregulated in pupae and the predicted target contigs  <dig> and  <dig> were strongly downregulated in pupae and pre-pupae, respectively . in contrast, whereas ame-mir-263b was also significantly upregulated in pupae, its predicted target contig  <dig> was upregulated rather than downregulated during metamorphosis . we found that dps-mir-210b was downregulated after  <dig> and 9 days exposure to m. anisopliae, and that its predicted targets contigs  <dig> and  <dig> were significantly upregulated at the corresponding time points . additionally, we determined the expression of dme-mir-2b-1-5p, bmo-mir-13b, api-mir- <dig>  dme-mir-981-5p, tca-mir-2788-5p and tca-mir-3867-3p in g. mellonella pupae and pre-pupae by rt-pcr in order to validate the microarray analysis . similarly, feeding larvae on a diet contaminated with s. entomophila resulted in the significant induction of api-mir-263a in the larval midgut, the rest of the body and even in the eggs laid by the female imagoes that were fed as larvae with entomopathogenic bacteria, whereas feeding the larvae with non-pathogenic escherichia coli bacteria caused the suppression of the same mirna .figure  <dig>

discussion
we have carried out the first screen for mirnas in the lepidopteran model host g. mellonella, using microarrays containing probes representing  <dig> mirnas from model insects with available genome sequences. we screened specifically for mirnas that are differentially expressed during metamorphosis or in response to infection compared to the expression profile in untreated last-instar larvae. we identified several mirnas that were significantly upregulated specifically in pre-pupae and/or pupae, indicating their potential involvement in the regulation of genes relevant to metamorphosis. we also identified mirnas that were modulated in response to infection with the entomopathogenic fungus m. anisopliae or the bacterial entomopathogen s. entomophila.

our recently-published comprehensive transcriptome dataset compensated, at least in part, for the absence of a complete g. mellonella genome sequence. the transcriptome data allowed us to identify potential 3′-utrs and align them with the modulated mirnas found by microarray analysis. this identified  <dig> mirnas and  <dig> corresponding target mrnas. the mfes required for hybridization allowed us to interrogate the aligned duplexes to confirm the mrna targets. we were then able to assign putative functions to the stage-specific and pathogen-induced g. mellonella mirnas based on the annotated sequences of other model insects. the in silico target prediction was validated by rt-pcr to confirm the coexpression of mirnas and their mrna targets.

the experiments described above produced a comprehensive collection of mirnas specifically expressed during g. mellonella metamorphosis. for example, we characterized development-related mirnas such as mir- <dig>  which targets g. mellonella mrnas encoding rio kinase  <dig>  26s protease regulatory subunit 10b and cral trio domain-containing protein, as recently reported from the lepidopteran manduca sexta
 <cit> . homologs of these proteins are involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression in humans. the developmental regulation of mir- <dig> in g. mellonella and c. elegans potentially indicates that mirna functions are conserved, in this case by influencing germline-mediated longevity
 <cit> .

the developmental regulation of mir- <dig> in g. mellonella is interesting because it is constitutively expressed during metamorphosis in b. mori, and negatively regulates apoptosis, chaeta development and compound eye morphogenesis in d. melanogaster
 <cit> . we observed the significant induction of api-mir-263b, api-mir-263a, aae-mir-263a and ame-mir-263b in g. mellonella during pupation, correlating with the expression profiles in b. mori. interestingly, the developmentally-modulated mirnas we identified in g. mellonella were similar to those identified following the comparative analysis of pre-metamorphic and metamorphic mirna libraries from the cockroach b. germanica, particularly mir-263a, mir-263b, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  which were identified by sequencing b. germinaca metamorphic nymphal instars
 <cit> . it is notable that the predicted metamorphosis-specific mirna targets in g. mellonella do not include mrnas encoding proteins involved in synthesis or binding of the ecdysone and juvenile hormones, which are known to regulate larval transformation into pupae. this suggests that mirnas act either independently or downstream of growth hormone signaling by regulating genes that are the targets of these hormones. similarly, mir-263a and mir-263b regulate immunity-related signal transduction by affecting the expression of genes related to the g. mellonella tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. the target mrnas were regulated oppositionally, i.e. contig  <dig> was suppressed and contig  <dig> was induced during metamorphosis . in addition, a recent study has shown that mir-263a influences expression of genes contributing to cellular and humoral immunity of m. sexta
 <cit> .

the induction of immunity-related genes is an established host response to pathogen challenge that ultimately allows the host to adapt, in a manner depending on the route of infection
 <cit> . however, little is known about the role of mirnas in this process
 <cit> . the injection of microbial elicitors such as bacterial peptidoglycan causes the differential expression of numerous mirnas, whereas only a limited number are induced during natural infections
 <cit> . furthermore, many mirnas induced by the experimental activation of immune responses are also upregulated following exposure to environmental stress, which makes their immunity-related functions uncertain
 <cit> . we therefore focused on g. mellonella mirnas that were expressed in response to natural infections with entomopathogens, either by ingestion  or via the integument .

we previously used this strategy to address transcriptional reprogramming by histone acetylation during g. mellonella metamorphosis and following the penetration of the cuticle by m. anisopliae
 <cit> . we provided experimental evidence that infection caused an imbalance between the enzymes responsible for histone acetylation and deacetylation, resulting in transcriptional reprogramming following infection and ultimately larval mortality. simultaneous inhibition of the enzyme complexes using commercial inhibitors either advances or delays the transformation of g. mellonella larvae into pupae, the outcome depending on both transcriptional and post-transcriptional epigenetic mechanisms. we confirmed the mirna-dependent post-transcriptional regulation of infection and development by testing the same parameters  suggesting potential crosstalk with other epigenetic mechanisms such as histone acetylation in g. mellonella.

the development of immunity against entomopathogenic fungi in g. mellonella involves the expression of antimicrobial peptides 
 <cit> . a small number of mirnas have been shown to downregulate amp genes in insects that are naturally infected with pathogens
 <cit> . this is also evident from our data, e.g. the significant downregulation of dps-mir-210b in response to entomopathogenic fungi. nf-κb <dig> is a mir- <dig> target, which negatively regulates the lps-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by macrophages
 <cit> . the downregulation of dps-mir-210b in g. mellonella caused the significant upregulation of targets represented by contigs  <dig> and  <dig>  which are functionally associated with transcriptional repressor activity, metabolism, inflammation, and growth regulation . this clearly reflects the parasitic behavior of m. anisopliae in this insect model, i.e. its ability to suppress the immune response and thus exploit host resources during the infection cycle.

in contrast to fungi which can infect insects via the exoskeleton
 <cit> , bacterial pathogens are ingested with contaminated food. the consumption of diets containing pathogenic bacteria results in the disruption of gut homeostasis, leading to dysbiosis and other gastrointestinal diseases
 <cit> . rt-pcr experiments confirmed the expression of selected mirnas in the midgut, rest of the body, and eggs of g. mellonella larvae fed on diets contaminated either with the pathogenic bacterium s. entomophila or a non-pathogenic strain of e. coli. the latter resulted in the specific upregulation of api-mir-263a whereas the same mirna was downregulated in response to s. entomophila. given that api-mir-263a regulates a number of downstream targets, the oppositional responses to different organisms suggest that distinct transcriptomic programs are orchestrated against pathogens such as s. entomophila and m. anisopliae compared to non-pathogenic organisms such as e. coli . we have recently reported that contamination of the larval diet of g. mellonella with s. entomophila results in specific immune responses both in the gut of fed larvae and in the eggs laid by females that consumed these entomopathogenic bacteria when they were larvae implicating specific trans-generational immune priming
 <cit> . complementarily, we report here expression of api-mir- <dig> both in the midgut of larvae fed with s. entomophila and in the eggs of females that were fed with these bacteria when they were larvae. these data implicate a role of api-mir- <dig> in trans-generational immune priming. however, it remains to be elucidated whether this or other mirnas are transferred from individuals that are exposed to a pathogen to the next generation in order the mediate transgenerational immune priming.

CONCLUSIONS
our microarray-based screening approach identified several g. mellonella mirnas that are differentially expressed during metamorphosis or in response to natural entomopathogenic infections. putative targets were predicted for mirnas showing the most significant modulation. these in silico predictions were then validated by quantifying the levels of mirnas and target mrnas by rt-pcr. we identified numerous mirnas that may contribute to the regulation of gene expression during metamorphosis and also individual mirnas that are modulated in response to the parasitic fungus m. anisopliae and the bacterial pathogen s. entomophila.
