BACKGROUND
gene regulation during embryonic development is regulated at the dna level by a number of proximal  and distal  regulatory regions that are organized by a variety of histone and non-histone proteins present in chromatin  <cit> . ocular lens development has been extensively studied to address the molecular mechanisms that control tissue-specific, temporal and spatial gene regulation  <cit> . the mammalian lens is composed of two cell types, the anterior proliferating lens epithelial cells and the posterior differentiating lens fiber cells, both of a single progenitor origin. lens fiber cells are characterized by a high concentration of crystallins, a family of proteins which constitute 90% of the water soluble proteins, and act as structural proteins in the lens  <cit> . these crystallins play key roles in maintaining lens transparency and in generating its refractive index. the relative simplicity of the lens embryonic origin, and its structure, make it an ideal model system to study the complexities of gene regulation  <cit> .

lens fiber cell differentiation is accompanied by the accumulation of high levels of αa-crystallin, representing 20–40% of the crystallin content of the human and mouse lens  <cit> . in addition to its role as a structural protein, αa-crystallin is also a member of the small heat shock protein family, thereby functioning as a molecular chaperone that prevents protein aggregation  <cit> , and possesses an autokinase activity  <cit> . disruption of αa-crystallin results in the formation of cataracts  <cit>  , and has also been shown to result in apoptosis of lens epithelial cells  <cit> , illustrating its vital role for lens homeostasis  <cit>  . furthermore, genetic studies in humans have shown that numerous αa-crystallin missense mutations result in cataract formation  <cit> . more recent studies have shown that αa-crystallin binds to and suppresses caspase  <dig> activity  <cit> . although αa-crystallin is expressed predominantly in the lens, low levels of its expression have been reported in the retina, spleen and thymus  <cit> . however, no specific function of αa-crystallin has been shown in these tissues.

our recent studies have identified two αa-crystallin lens-specific enhancers, dcr <dig>  and dcr <dig>   <cit>  as novel distal regulatory regions involved in transcriptional regulation of the αa-crystallin gene. conventional transgenic approaches utilizing dcr <dig> and dcr <dig> fused to the  <dig>  kb αa-crystallin promoter were successful in expressing egfp in both lens epithelium and fiber cells. however, while endogenous αa-crystallin expression was first apparent in the lens pit at e <dig> , these transgenics expressed egfp one day later in the lens vesicle, leading us to hypothesize that additional cis regulatory elements were required to recapitulate endogenous αa-crystallin expression. in this study we utilized bac transgenics as a means to dissect further the transcriptional regulation of the αa-crystallin gene. our main goal was to narrow down the genomic region that harbour lens-specific essential regulatory regions required for the initiation of αa-crystallin gene expression in the lens pit.

RESULTS
endogenous αa-crystallin expression in mouse eye
consistent with previous reports of αa-crystallin mrna expression monitored by in situ hybridizations  <cit> , endogenous αa-crystallin protein expression is first apparent in the lens pit at e <dig>  . expression is up-regulated at e <dig>  in the lens vesicle  and continues to be highly expressed in the differentiating primary fiber cells at e <dig>  , and within the fiber cells of the newborn lens . lower levels of αa-crystallin are expressed in lens epithelium compared to lens fiber cells of the postnatal day  <dig>  lens .

expression pattern of egfp driven by  <dig> kb cryaa bac, αa-bac
prior studies identified two distal control regions, dcr <dig> and dcr <dig> , that, in combination with a  <dig>  kb promoter fragment, recapitulate most aspects of transcriptional regulation of αa-crystallin  <cit> . however, in these studies, the onset of egfp expression was between e11-e <dig> , which is at least  <dig> hours after the onset of endogenous αa-crystallin expression . this finding suggests other regulatory regions could be required. to address this, we generated a bac transgenic by modifying a  <dig> kb bac encompassing the αa-crystallin gene  through an in frame insertion of egfp into the third exon, by homologous recombination according to  <cit>  . egfp was inserted after v <dig>  close to the c-end of the  <dig> amino acid αa-crystallin. four founders were generated, but only three were studied due to breeding difficulties encountered with the fourth founder. all founders had visually green eyes, and transgene integrations were subsequently confirmed by genotyping. the copy number of the transgenic lines was determined by qpcr  as described in methods.

constructs
* one line had breeding issues and was not studied

embryonic egfp expression analysis revealed that all three lines first express egfp at e <dig>  , which is temporally congruent with the onset of endogenous αa-crystallin expression . though egfp is expressed in the lens vesicle at e <dig>  , it becomes significantly upregulated at e <dig>  in the differentiating primary lens fiber cells. significantly lower egfp expression was found in a small number of the overlying epithelial cells compared to the primary lens fiber cell compartment . this pattern of egfp expression continues through e <dig>   and in the pnd <dig> lens , with high levels present in the differentiating lens fiber cells and lower expression evident in some cells of the lens epithelium. thus, expression of egfp inserted into the  <dig> kb cryaa bac , due to its earlier onset, better recapitulates the expression patterns of endogenous αa-crystallin in lens  when compared to the expression from dcr1/αa/egfp transgenes  <cit> .

removal of a  <dig>  kb region containing dcr <dig> does not affect early αa-crystallin/egfp expression in αa-bac
to test if dcr <dig> is essential for expression of cryaa gene, we generated a bac transgene which lacks approximately  <dig>  kb of the cryaa genomic region, including dcr <dig> downstream of the third exon  . this results from a genomic deletion that occurs simultaneously with the insertion of egpf into the third exon using the pld <dig> sc-ab shuttle vector  <cit> . three lines are generated which express egfp and contain two to five copies of the transgene .

similar to αa-bac, egfp expression is first evident in the lens pit at e <dig>   in one of the three αa-bac  lines. expression of egfp is also detected in the lens vesicle  and is upregulated considerably in the differentiating lens fiber cells at e <dig>  . as development progresses, egfp is intensely expressed in the lens fiber cells at e <dig>   and pnd  <dig> . lower egfp is also evident in some lens epithelial cells at these stages . the remaining two lines  have a delayed onset of egfp expression, first found in the lens vesicle stage of development .

a  <dig> kb αa-crystallin/egfp fragment which lacks dcr <dig> is sufficient for the earliest expression in the lens pit
the distance between the 5' end of dcr <dig> to the 3' border of dcr <dig> in mouse is approximately  <dig> kb and is marked by a corresponding domain of lens-specific chromatin  <cit> . in addition, our present  and earlier data  <cit>  suggest that dcr <dig> may not be required for expression either in the lens pit or lens vesicle. to narrow down the genomic region required for egfp expression in the lens pit, we released a  <dig> kb xmai-spei cryaa/egfp fragment from αa-bac   and used it to generate six transgenic founders, all of which expressed egfp in the lens. the two lines showing the lowest expression of egfp were not analyzed further.

all four remaining lines expressed egfp at e <dig>  in the invaginating lens pit . as development progressed, strong egfp was found throughout the lens vesicle at e <dig>  . in addition to the characteristic upregulation of egfp in the differentiating fiber cells at e <dig> , all transgenic lines also displayed intense egfp expression in the lens epithelium , which was less evident in the αa-crystallin bac transgenics . similarly, the lens epithelial cells at e <dig>   and at postnatal day  <dig>  also displayed stronger egfp expression in the lens epithelium compared to their bac counterparts. however, while high levels of egfp expression were observed in lens, numerous embryos from different lines also exhibited extralenticular expression in regions such as the hindbrain, and other areas of the head . from these results we conclude that expression of αa-crystallin/egfp in the lens pit is regulated by one or more enhancers present presumably within the  <dig> kb xmai-spei genomic fragment, functionally distinct from dcr <dig> 

transgene expression of egfp compared to endogenous αa-crystallin expression
immunolabeling with anti-αa-crystallin antibody was conducted to evaluate co-expression with the transgenes visualized via egfp. the representative data on αa-crystallin  and egfp  proteins are shown in fig.  <dig>  a few yellow  cells in the lens pit of αa-bac  and αa-bac  transgenics at e <dig>  demonstrate co-expression of egfp and αa-crystallin . however, while the expression of αa-crystallin seems to prevail over egfp in the lens pit  in both bac models, it appears that transgene egfp is catching up to endogenous αa-crystallin as more yellow signal is observed at e <dig>   compared to e <dig>  . in contrast, co-expression analysis of the  <dig> kb cryaa/egfp unit at e <dig>  , shows more cells with a stronger egfp signal over the αa-crystallin.

at e <dig> , while a small number of cells appeared to co-express αa-crystallin and egfp in the lens vesicle of the αa-bac transgenics , far more cells co-expressed apparently both proteins in αa-bac  and in the  <dig> kb cryaa/egfp lenses . coinciding with the onset of lens fiber cell differentiation at e <dig> , lines from all three trangenes displayed significant co-expression of both proteins in lens primary fiber cells . at e <dig>   and postnatally , most lens fiber cells gave very strong egfp signals over the red signals that originated from both the endogenous and fusion/egfp proteins .

expression of egfp in non-lenticular tissues of all transgenic models
egfp expression was not microscopically observed in any non-lenticular embryonic tissue of αa-bac or αa-bac transgenics. in order to determine whether egfp was expressed in any specific non-lenticular tissue, we performed qrt-pcr analysis of total rnas obtained from 1-day old lens, retina, brain, thymus, heart, spleen, kidney, liver and muscle. we did not detect any expression of egfp mrna by qrt-pcr  in any non-lenticular tissue examined.

extralenticular egfp expression however was visually evident in the brain and head region of several of the  <dig> kb cryaa/egfp embryos from multiple lines . analyses by qrt-pcr of the cryaa and egfp mrnas  further substantiated exogenous expression in regions such as the brain, retina, kidney, spleen and muscle and their levels were found to be  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % as compared to egfp expression in the lens, respectively. these results suggest that regions outside of this  <dig> kb/egfp fragment, while present in the  <dig> kb cryaa bac, may play a role in modulation of extralenticular expression of αa-crystallin.

discussion
initial studies of mouse αa-crystallin gene expression have shown that the αa-crystallin promoter fragment - <dig> to + <dig> supports expression of a linked cat gene only in lens fibers  <cit> . two novel regulatory regions of the mouse cryaa locus, dcr <dig> and dcr <dig>  have been recently identified and studied in transgenic mice  <cit> . using the dcr1/ <dig>  kb promoter/egfp reporter system, we detect initial egfp expression in the lens vesicle  although the onset of endogenous αa-crystallin commences in the invaginating lens placode/lens pit around e <dig>  . this finding suggests that other regulatory regions are required for the proper onset of αa-crystallin expression as the lens placode invaginates to form the lens pit . here, we find that a modified  <dig> kb region of the mouse cryaa locus  can support robust egfp expression in the lens pit of e <dig>  mouse embryos , and, thus, represents a reasonable source from which to identify the "earliest" enhancer of the cryaa locus. moreover, the  <dig> kb cryaa bac is insufficient for appreciable egfp expression in the retina, spleen and thymus  <cit> .

novel insights into the temporal and spatial regulation of αa-crystallin gene expression in lens and extralenticular tissues
all three αa-bac transgenic lines display both temporal and spatial expression patterns of egfp that are qualitatively comparable to those of the endogenous αa-crystallin in lens. egfp expression is first detected at e <dig>  in the lens pit, and subsequently expressed in both the lens epithelium and fiber cells of the developing and newborn lens. the only significant difference between egfp and αa-crystallin expression is much lower number of cells co-expressing both proteins between e <dig>  and e <dig>  . the most likely reason for this difference is the position-dependent distinct epigenetic regulatory mechanisms  <cit>  between the endogenous cryaa locus and randomly integrated  <dig> kb cryaa bacs.

previous studies conducted with traditional transgenics suggested that dcr <dig> plays a specific role during "late" primary lens fiber cell differentiation  <cit> . herein, the deletion of dcr <dig> in both αa-bac and the  <dig> kb cryaa/egfp trangenes did not have any prevailing effect on the onset of egfp expression in the lens, compared to the expression of αa-bac transgenes, as  <dig> out of  <dig> independent lines  showed egfp expression in the lens pit. the number of lines analyzed here is comparable to similar transgenic studies  <cit> . though dcr <dig> constituted a portion of the cryaa 3'-utr, its deletion seemed not to affect the average expression of egfp mrna obtained from both bac transgenes . nevertheless, the possible function of dcr <dig> in αa-crystallin mrna processing and stability will require additional experimentation.

a lens-specific chromatin domain between dcr <dig> and dcr <dig> of the mouse cryaa locus  <cit>  may represent the minimal size of the mouse cryaa locus . since dcr <dig> appears to act as a "late" fiber-cell specific enhancer, we examined a  <dig> kb cryaa/egfp fragment without dcr <dig>  from our results, it was evident that the genomic regions required for early temporal αa-crystallin expression in the developing lens are present within this  <dig> kb modified genomic fragment, as egfp expression initiated in the lens pit at e <dig>  in all four lines . in fact, it appears that more cells in the lens pit expressed egfp than endogenous αa-crystallin . this observation requires additional comments, as the αa-crystallin antibody is expected to recognize both αa-crystallin and αa/egfp fusion proteins. for example, it is possible that the epitopes recognized by the polyclonal antiserum could be masked during the presumptive formation of αa-crystallin/egfp oligomers  <cit> . it is also possible that the αa-crystallin/egfp fusion proteins precipitate with other proteins to interfere with antibody recognition consistent with a range of lens opacities found in all transgenic lenses studied . even if the protein remains unblocked, a constant, but unknown, fraction of the protein is bound by antibody under experimental conditions, whereas all of the transgene-derived protein is egfp-tagged. moreover, the relative fluorescence produced by each tag is different, so, although relative location can be estimated, relative amounts of two proteins within any sample should never be compared by this methodology. it is quite possible that the fluorescence intensity elicited from egfp at sufficient concentration will always obscure the immunofluorescence signal from αa-crystallin under the experimental conditions used.

in the past, αa-crystallin was referred to either as a lens-specific, or as a lens-preferred protein with high expression in lens, and low expression in retina, spleen and thymus  <cit> . more recent high-throughput data, available through the mgi and unigene websites , expanded the previously established extralenticular regions of αa-crystallin expression to the heart, hindbrain, midbrain, cerebellum, pancreas, pituitary and a few other tissues. thus, expression of egfp driven by the  <dig> kb cryaa/egfp in regions such as the hindbrain from e <dig> – <dig>   may reflect its naturally low expression in this tissue. analysis of guinea pig ζ-crystallin transcriptional control indeed identified a brain-specific regulatory region  <cit> . interestingly, expression of egfp, supported by the  <dig> kb cryaa bac, was not detected by qrt-pcr in spleen or thymus. one intriguing possibility is that expression in these tissues originates via elements shared with the adjacent u2af <dig>  and snf1lk  genes, but not present in the  <dig> kb bac. a u <dig> small nuclear ribonucleoprotein auxiliary factor gene, u2af <dig>  also carried in this bac, encodes a heterodimeric splicing factor  <cit> . the αa-bac transgenic lines also exhibit elevated u2af <dig> , while expression of snf1lk was not tested due to its absence in the  <dig> kb bac .

thus, the present data suggest that the genomic regions required for αa-crystallin expression in the retina, spleen and thymus are not present in the  <dig> kb cryaa bac and may be located in genomic regions adjacent to this bac clone, or, as in the case of genes such as olfactory receptors, these regulatory regions may be present on another chromosome  <cit> . the interferon-γ locus on chromosome  <dig> is similarly regulated by elements within a locus encoding the th <dig> cytokine genes on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . the complexity of the genome in relationship to the individual genes and their regulation is far more complex than previously thought  <cit> .

transgene positional/copy number effects and lens structural integrity
although the general concept is that large transgenes, such as bacs and yacs, are not susceptible to positional effects  <cit> , the lack of egfp expression at e <dig>  in  <dig> out of  <dig> αa-bac transgenic lines suggests otherwise. previous reports have indicated that generally one to five copes of bacs are inserted into the genome  <cit> , however recent studies have suggested that this is not always the case. in fact, analyses conducted by chandler et al.,  <dig> reveal that, while  <dig> % of transgenes are inserted as copies ranging between 1– <dig>  bacs can be inserted with much greater copies, even up to almost  <dig>  <cit> . additional bac studies have reported copy numbers to be also in excess of  <dig>  <cit> .

analysis of the structural integrity of the adult lens reveals that both bac and  <dig> kb cryaa/egfp transgenics display opacities . in fact, some of the αa-bac and  <dig> kb cryaa/egfp transgenic mice begin to show signs of lens opacities upon eye opening . morphologically these adult transgenic mouse lenses appear to display nuclear cataracts, resembling human and mouse models of cryaa cataracts  <cit> . given the overpression of αa-crystallin/egfp, one can speculate plausible mechanisms contributing to lens opacities. firstly, it is possible that excess of αa-crystallin egfp fusion proteins interferes with the stoichiometric ratio of αa and αb-crystallins in the α-crystallin heteroaggregate complex, leading to the misfolding and precipitation of proteins. expression of the αa-crystallin/egfp fusion protein may also play a role in disrupting other normal interactions of lens proteins, resulting in protein aggregation precipitation and cataract formation.

CONCLUSIONS
the present studies have shown that a modified genomic fragment of  <dig> kb cryaa/egfp is sufficient to direct the earliest onset of αa-crystallin/egfp expression in the lens pit . the leading candidate regions to harbour this early enhancer activity are four exons , and evolutionarily conserved regions in introns  <dig> and  <dig> .
