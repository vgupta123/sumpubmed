BACKGROUND
voltage-gated sodium channels  are recognized as a diverse group that consist of at least nine different subtypes or isoforms  <cit> . the activation of nachs is a key event leading to action potential generation and impulse propagation  <cit> . these isoforms are differentially distributed throughout the nervous system and show important changes in expression after inflammatory and axotomy insults and some of these changes may contribute to the development and maintenance of pain states  <cit> . much attention has been placed on the evaluation of changes in the expression of specific isoforms after lesions and especially of those that are preferentially expressed in the peripheral nervous system  <cit> . much less is known about changes in expression after peripheral injury of isoforms that are more widely expressed in both the peripheral and central nervous systems, such as nav <dig> .

the nav <dig>  isoform is strongly expressed by sensory neurons  <cit> , located in unmyelinated fibers  <cit>  and also represents the isoform located at nodes of ranvier  <cit> . the node of ranvier contains a high density of nachs whose activation is necessary for saltatory conduction  <cit>  and thus represents a key region influencing the excitability of myelinated fibers. changes in the density or distribution of nachs at the node of ranvier may contribute to changes in excitability that follow experimental nerve insults or in disease states. even though nav <dig>  plays a key role in the propagation of action potentials throughout the nervous system, studies that have evaluated changes in its expression in pain states are limited  <cit> .

we are studying the role of altered nach expression in trigeminal pain states and have used a combined partial axotomy and chromic suture lesion of the rat infraorbital nerve  that produces a behavior characterized by increased sensitivity to mechanical stimuli as a model system where we can quantify changes in expression within single fibers  <cit> . through the use of this model and methodology, we have described significant remodeling and augmentation of nach immunofluorescence within intact and presumably demyelinating nodes of ranvier with the use of a "pan-specific" antibody that recognizes a conserved sequence seen in the alpha subunit of all vertebrate nach isoforms  <cit> . in this study we use the same lesion and evaluate the contribution of the nav <dig>  isoform to the remodeling of nachs that was identified with the pan-specific antibody used in the earlier study.

RESULTS
behavioral response to monofilament stimulation
monofilament stimulation of the vibrissa pad two weeks after the ion lesion showed less force was needed to produce a threshold behavioral response  on the side of the lesion when compared to that seen in normal control subjects. the four normal control subjects showed either a lack of threshold response or threshold response only with the maximum  <dig> gram force stimulus, while the experimental subjects individually showed threshold responses after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> gram force stimulations.

qualitative observations of nav <dig>  and caspr staining patterns and relationships in normal vs. lesioned ions
examination of the nav <dig>  and caspr-staining patterns and relationships with the confocal microscope revealed a dramatic difference in the extent and intensity of immunofluorescence of both nav <dig>  and caspr between normal and lesioned ions . typical nodes of ranvier were identified as the gap seen between the paranodal staining of caspr with the nav <dig>  staining at nodes in normal ions assuming a prominent disc-like appearance . the caspr staining was typically intense and selective within the paranodal region and associated with sharp demarcation borders. most of the large nav <dig>  accumulations with bright staining intensity were associated with prominent caspr staining seen in the paranodal regions. weak staining of caspr was also seen along some nerve fibers.

in contrast, the typical association of intense nav <dig>  at the node bordered on both sides by bright caspr staining in the paranodal area was altered in lesioned ions . in general, both the intensity and the area occupied by nav <dig>  immunofluorescence increased at nodes, while the paranodal staining of caspr appeared attenuated. the nav <dig>  accumulations in lesioned tissue appeared larger, brighter and more ovoid rather than the disc-like appearance seen in normal ions. the caspr staining associated with these "typical" nodes also appeared less intense. the common relationship of caspr with nav <dig>  was also altered in some accumulations and included the presence of "heminodes" where caspr staining was located on only one side of a contiguous nav <dig>  accumulation and "split nodes" where two distinct nach accumulations were separated by a gap in the same fiber and with each accumulation flanked on one side by caspr . finally, the total number of nav <dig>  accumulations appeared to be significantly increased in the lesioned tissue . in contrast to the dense nav <dig>  staining seen at nodes, selective labeling of fibers that lacked an association with caspr, and that most likely represent unmyelinated fibers, was absent in the ions of both control and lesioned subjects.

since the apparent density, size  and intensity of nav <dig>  accumulations, and the intensity of caspr staining in the paranodal region of typical nodes appeared so different in lesioned ions when compared to normal ions, these observations were evaluated further using quantitative techniques.

quantitative evaluation of the density and size of nav <dig>  accumulations in normal vs. lesioned ions
quantitative evaluation determined that the density  and size  of nav <dig>  accumulations were both significantly greater in the lesioned ions when compared to normal ions. the density analysis  calculated a density of  <dig>  +/-  <dig>   accumulations/mm <dig> in lesioned ions and  <dig>  +/-  <dig>   accumulations/mm <dig> in normal ions . the average size  of nav <dig>  accumulations was  <dig>  +/-  <dig>   in lesioned ions and  <dig>  +/-  <dig>   in normal ions .

quantitative evaluation of nav <dig>  and caspr immunofluorescence staining intensities and nodal gap axial length within single caspr-identified typical nodes in normal vs. lesioned ions
the average intensity of pixels with nav <dig>  immunofluorescence located within typical nodes was significantly greater  in lesioned ions when compared to normal ions  vs.  <dig>  +/-  <dig>  ; fig. 3c). in addition, the analysis of typical nodesalso showed that the average nodal gap axial length as measured by the number of pixels in the caspr-demarcated gap that is occupied by nav <dig> , was significantly greater  in lesioned ions than in normal ions  vs.  <dig>  +/-  <dig>  ; fig. 3d). thus nav <dig>  nodal clusters appear to have significantly broadened in lesioned ions. in contrast, the evaluation of the average intensity of pixels with caspr immunofluorescence within the paranodal region of typical nodes showed that this intensity was significantly less  in the lesioned ions when compared to normal ions  vs.  <dig>  +/-  <dig>  ; fig. 3e).

discussion
in a previous study we described striking changes in nach expression in a location just proximal to a combined partial axotomy and chromic suture lesion of the ion  <cit> . the present investigation specifically identifies the involvement of the nav <dig>  isoform in the augmentation and remodeling of nachs at intact and presumptive demyelinating sites and in the increased density of nach accumulations that were previously identified with the use of the pan-specific nach antibody in this nerve injury model. most studies that have evaluated the role of altered nach expression in peripheral pain states  have focused on the role of the nav <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  isoforms that are preferentially expressed in the peripheral nervous system and seen in a subset of nociceptors  <cit>  and on the re-expression of nav <dig>  after injury  <cit> . many of these have evaluated changes in protein and gene expressions at the cell body level, while fewer have evaluated changes in single fibers at the site of nerve injury. although nav <dig>  has been identified as the major isoform located at nodes of ranvier in both the peripheral and central nervous systems  <cit> , few studies have examined changes in its localization or expression in disease and injury states in the peripheral nervous system. one study did evaluate nav <dig>  expression in an experimental painful diabetic neuropathy rat model and found increased mrna and protein levels in sensory neurons thus implicating the involvement of this isoform in the generation of altered neuronal activity in this pain condition  <cit> .

two primary questions that arise from the present observations concern; 1) the mechanisms underlying such changes in sodium channel expression, and 2) the possible role of such changes in the establishment and maintenance of a chronic hyperalgesic state. with respect to the first question, bennett and xie introduced the use of chromic suture ligation of the sciatic nerve to produce a rat model of neuropathic pain  <cit>  and this lesion was later adapted to the rat ion  <cit> . chromic suture nerve lesions result in behavior that is suggestive of neuropathic pain and this behavior may be due in part to chemicals present in the chromic suture  <cit> . however, chromic suture produces a potent inflammatory response  <cit> , and this localized inflammatory response may contribute to the development of a demyelinating lesion.

a number of previous studies have shown that disruption of myelin results in profound changes in nach expression in axons  <cit> . paranodal and segmental demyelination are both associated with a widening of the nodal gap  <cit>  and an augmentation of nachs can occur within this gap  <cit> , thus accounting for similar observations seen in the present study. this widened nodal gap may result from a disruption of axoglial signaling mechanisms that are critical to the localization of ion channels into the nodal and paranodal regions of the axolemma  <cit> . the reduction of caspr staining seen in the paranodal region within the lesioned ions has also been seen in axons within demyelinating lesions in patients with multiple sclerosis  <cit> , and most likely reflects altered signaling mechanisms occurring in early stages of paranodal demyelination. furthermore, nach clusters have been reported to form spontaneously in chronically demyelinated axonal segments  <cit> , and this could account for the increased number of nav <dig>  clusters observed in the present study, particularly those associated with altered caspr relationships such as heminodes. heminodes are normally seen during development  <cit>  and after experimentally-induced demyelination with lysolecithin  <cit> . although it seems likely that most of the changes that we observed after the use of the combined partial axotomy/chromic suture lesion result from alterations in myelination secondary to the use of the chromic suture, our methods did not allow a differentiation of nach remodeling in fibers affected by axotomy and chromic suture to those affected by chromic suture alone and so attributes from the axotomy are possible.

the nav <dig>  isoform may also be involved in the pathogenesis of demyelination. studies done in humans and experimental animal models for multiple sclerosis have shown nav <dig>  expression in activated glia within the central nervous system  <cit> . in addition, it has been reported that nav <dig>  colocalizes with the na+/ca+ exchanger in demyelinated axons with the suggestion that this colocalization may trigger axon injury  <cit> . together, these previous findings and our present findings suggest an important role for nav <dig>  in both peripheral and central demyelinating conditions.

the role of such pathological changes in nach distributions to neuropathic pain mechanisms is less certain. one popular hypothesis is that such localized increases in channel expression results in increased action potential generation near the injury site, thus contributing to the activation of pain pathways  <cit> . furthermore, it has been proposed that increased nach clusters in demyelinated axons may contribute to repetitive firing and thus act like pacemaker zones that are normally located within axonal endings  <cit> . even so, the changes seen here may result in decreased excitability and this possibility identifies the need for additional studies that evaluate changes in nach expression with alterations in neuronal excitability.

since we limited our quantitative evaluation of nav <dig>  to those located in large accumulations, such as those found at nodes of ranvier in myelinated fibers, we most likely did not evaluate possible changes in expression within unmyelinated fibers. even though nav <dig>  has been described in unmyelinated axons , the selective labeling of small fibers that lacked paranodal caspr staining was absent in the ions of both control and lesioned subjects. this difference could be related to the use of different antibodies. thus, the possible contribution of the nav <dig>  accumulations within the myelinated fibers evaluated in the present study to neuropathic pain mechanisms would likely arise through stimulation of the normal a-delta or a-beta pathways. naturally, possible changes in the expression of nav <dig>  in unmyelinated fibers would be important to evaluate in the future since altered activity after inflammatory and axotomy lesions most likely involves contributions from both myelinated and unmyelinated axons.

the development of isoform-specific inhibitors would be useful to further understand the role of each isoform to the development of a complex acute and chronic pain state. concurrent changes in multiple isoforms are certainly possible and these changes may be site specific at the subcellular level, so that some have greater influence within the axon, soma or central projections of sensory neurons. nonetheless, evidence is rapidly accruing that sodium channel expression is highly plastic in various forms of inflammatory and neuropathic pain conditions, begging the question of how such changes might be causal to pain mechanisms.

CONCLUSIONS
our findings identify the involvement of nav <dig>  in the augmentation and remodeling of nachs at nodal sites within single fibers located just proximal to the site of a combined partial axotomy and chromic suture lesion to the ion. the augmentation of nav <dig>  may result from an alteration in axon-schwann cell signaling mechanisms as suggested by changes in caspr expression. the changes identified in this study suggest that the activation of nav <dig>  may be important when examining changes in excitability of myelinated axons in various models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain.
