BACKGROUND
hepatocellular carcinoma  is one of the most common cancers worldwide and chronic hepatitis b virus  infection is the most important cause of hcc in taiwan  <cit> . most hcc patients are diagnosed in old age with only a small portion of them younger than 40 years old  <cit> . compared with the elderly hcc patients, young hcc  cases  are more likely to be symptomatic at diagnosis and the hcc stage tends to be more advanced. thus, there is a decreased chance of curative resection for the tumors in this group  <cit> . although the presence of cirrhosis is less frequent in young patients  <cit> , the time to yhcc recurrence after surgical resection was shorter and a one year survival rate was lower than those with elderly patients  <cit> . an aggressive clinical course and a poor prognosis have also been reported in children with hcc  <cit> . if yhcc patients survived longer than one year, their long-term survivals seemed to be better than those of elderly hcc patients due to fewer incidences of associated cirrhosis and relatively better liver function reserves  <cit> . high serum alpha-fetoprotein levels are more often found in yhcc patients  <cit> . hbv viral load is not a predictor in the development of hcc in young adults  <cit> , in contrast, viral load and hepatic inflammatory activity were associated with late recurrence of hcc among elderly patients after resection of the primary hcc  <cit> . the aforementioned findings suggest that hepatocarcinogenesis in yhccs is different from that in elderly patients. yet the underlying mechanisms and the detail molecular portrait of yhcc remain unclear.

it has also been recognized that cancer cells, especially those of advanced and metastatic cancers, possess characteristics reminiscent of normal stem cells. the degree of stem cell gene reactivation or tumor cell dedifferentiation correlates with pivotal tumor features and prognosis  <cit> . a recent paper demonstrated by rt-qpcr, that the high expression levels of putative hepatic stem/progenitor cell biomarkers are related to tumor angiogenesis and a poor prognosis for hcc  <cit> . however, no similar study has addressed yhcc. identifying genes involved in cancer progression and cell dedifferentiation offers another dimension to predict hcc recurrence, as well as providing novel therapeutic targets and prognosis markers.

RESULTS
clinical profiles, serological data, and histopathological findings for the hccs from young and elderly patients enrolled in array analysis
the clinical profiles, serological data, and histopathological findings for young and elderly hcc patients in the training cohort are in table  <dig>  in  <dig> enrolled primary hbsag positive hcc patients,  <dig> cases were yhccs and  <dig> were elderly. macroscopic venous invasion was more frequent , but accompanied cirrhosis was significantly fewer in younger subjects . consistent with fewer cirrhotic patients in the younger group, the icg- <dig> retention was lower  and the platelet counts tended to be higher . there were no statistically significant differences in the remaining parameters between these two groups.

molecular signatures of yhccs
data analysis steps were summarized in additional file 1: figure s <dig> online. to explore the molecular mechanisms governing the diverse clinical behaviors of the different hccs, we delineated gene expression profiles of  <dig> primary hcc samples, as well as those of  <dig> non-cancerous tissues, from the above  <dig> patients as a training data set. a multidimensional scaling  plot using the whole transcriptome showed that the mrna profiles of normal and cancerous tissues were different, while tumors of different age groups were similar . we compared tumor samples to non-tumor counterparts for minimizing stromal and myometrial contamination. a total of  <dig> probe sets were differentially expressed between young and elderly hccs  q <  <dig> ), as well as between tumor and non-tumor tissues of yhcc patients .

the discrimination ability of these  <dig> probe sets were further trained by performing supervised machine learning that combined weighted voting algorithm and leave-one-out cross validation   <cit> , on the 2nd external data set ). an error rate of  <dig> %  was found . the top  <dig> features  form a largest panel to have the best discrimination ability than that of the 449-probeset signature . the discrimination ability of these  <dig> probe sets was evaluated on an independent testing data set that included another  <dig> yhccs and  <dig> taiwanese elderly hccs /international union against cancer  staging system  <cit> ). prediction strength  and principle component analysis  plots showed that these  <dig> probe sets distinguished young and elderly hccs well.

the distribution of these  <dig> probe sets among sample groups were examined by hierarchical clustering. the differences in gene expression profiles between elderly and yhcc were more striking in tumor parts as compared to those in non-tumor parts . a heat map for these genes indicated the unique gene expression levels in yhcc, with  <dig> probe sets being predominantly up in yhccs  while another  <dig> being down . many of yhcc-enriched genes, such as ctnnd <dig> , rab <dig> , sox <dig> -box 13), etv <dig> , dnmt <dig> , tle <dig> , mll , and mll <dig>  have been associated with tumor malignancy and poor patient outcomes in hcc or other cancers . these consistent findings support the reliability of our gene list. genes down-regulated in yhcc  are shown in additional file 2: table s <dig> 

*genes discussed in the text.

coordinated functional module changes in yhccs
to understand how genes enriched in yhcc are related to each other, as well as to spot the more critical yhcc genes, we performed systems biology analysis. a major genetic network contains known cancer-related or pro-proliferating genes, including cdc25a, cdk <dig>  fus , tle <dig>  and ilf <dig>  was formed . central to the network, there were hub genes , including mll, smarca <dig>  smarcb <dig>  smarcc <dig>  and rbbp <dig>  .

to understand better how gene expression profiles correlate with pathogenesis and tumor phenotypes, signature probe sets were subjected into canonical pathways and functional group analysis using the ingenuity pathway analysis  and gene ontology  databases, respectively. the most significant canonical pathway mapped is the “brca <dig> in dna damage response” pathway . other predominant pathways were dna double-strand break repair, dna methylation and transcriptional repression and atm signaling . consistent with the unique expression profile of yhccs, the genes involved in the regulation of transcription were enriched in yhccs . genes involved in chromatin modification are also unique in yhccs . other related predominant go processes included those pertaining to dna repair  and m phase cell cycle  .

increased embryonic stem cell  traits in hccs, especially those from young patients
stemness genes are known to contribute largely in tumorigenesis and disease progression  <cit> . for narrowing down key genes and obtaining more insights in yhcc pathogenesis, the above  <dig> probe sets were used to compare the relationships between hccs and esc. transcriptome distances were measured by calculating the average linkage distances. compared with non-tumor tissues, hccs of different age categories were closer to escs , suggesting the re-expression of esc genes is a characteristic feature during tumorigenesis. the closest correlation between esc and yhcc was observed, indicating the level of esc gene re-expression was inversely correlated with patient age .

the distributions of these  <dig> probe sets among sample groups were shown using a heat map . among genes enriched in yhcc, a subgroup of genes was also abundant in stem cells, especially in esc . table  <dig> shows esc genes overexpressed in yhcc patients. among them,  <dig> genes were involved in cell cycle control ,  <dig> genes in dna repair , and  <dig> genes in blastocyst growth  . intriguingly, ilf <dig> is among the ‘core 9’ esc transcription regulators that were highly expressed in poorly differentiated breast cancers, glioblastomas, and bladder carcinomas . the differential expression of ilf <dig> between young and elderly hccs was verified by rt-qpcr .

decreasing hepatic differentiation program in yhccs and during disease progression in elderly hccs
we hypothesized that yhccs also forfeited genes associated with liver differentiation and thereby were more dedifferentiated and malignant. liver precursor characteristics were examined in the yhcc samples by comparing the relationships between hcc subgroups and liver progenitor cells . an inverse correlation between the hepatogenesis process with patient ages was observed . such impressions were strengthened by calculating the transcriptome distances between the sample groups . among the  <dig> yhcc genes,  <dig> genes were more abundant in differentiated liver progenitor cells . these  <dig> genes, which are also downregulated in yhccs, hold the potentials of being novel tumor suppressor genes in yhccs.

the above observation inspired us to hypothesize further that the forfeiting of hepatogenesis traits may have also occurred during disease progression in hccs of the same age group. we examined the associations between esc gene patterns and clinical stage. early  and late  hccs  <cit>  used in the validation cohort were applied to compare the relationships with es cells and the advanced t <dig> cases were closer to es cells . such relationships were validated by evaluating another independent serum anti-hcv positive hcc data set  <cit> . this data set included four neoplastic stages  from patients with hcv infection  <cit> . when the relationships between the different pathological hcc subgroups and pluripotent stem cells   <cit> ) were compared, an increased stemness that accurately reflected the pathological progression of the disease was again observed . a dedifferentiation-like transcriptome drift  was anti-correlated with the hepatic differentiation program of pluripotent stem cells , indicating a dedifferentiation status during the progression of hcv-related hcc.

discussion
this study explored the gene expression profile of yhcc. we found the age difference between hcc patients is mirrored in their gene expression profiles. a similar observation has been reported for other cancers: there was a clear segregation of the pediatric and adult germ cell tumors  <cit> , and pediatric glioblastomas also have a characteristic transcriptome profile different from that of adult tumors  <cit> . the outcomes of melanoma in the younger and the elderly populations were also different and these  <dig> patient groups express distinct microrna profiles  <cit> . thus, age difference between patients with the same disease can be mirrored in their gene expression profiles. patients of different ages but with the same tumor should be treated in different ways.

gender disparity is a well known phenotype in hcc, and animal studies suggest that it may be due to the stimulatory effects of androgen and the protective effects of estrogen . estrogen can protect hepatocytes from malignant transformation  <cit> . intriguingly, both the androgen receptor  and estrogen receptor  <dig>  sex hormone receptors are down-regulated in yhccs . genes involved in estrogen receptor signaling are also enriched in the yhcc signature . since all of our yhcc patients were sexually matured , our data indicates an original and a unique pathogenesis mechanism in yhccs.

hcc with stemness-related marker expression has recently been proposed to be a new and more aggressive subtype of hcc  <cit> . it is important that a suitable marker panel is developed to facilitate the diagnosis of this devastating hcc subtype. rt-qpcr analysis on elderly hccs demonstrated that the high expression levels of  <dig> putative hepatic stem/progenitor cell biomarkers , abcg <dig>  cd <dig>  nestin, cd <dig>  epcam and ov6), is related to tumor angiogenesis and a poor prognosis for the hcc  <cit> . recently, a stemness-related marker, ck <dig>  was found well correlated with clinicopathologic features of tumor aggressiveness, vascular invasion, and poor differentiation in elderly hccs  <cit> . no similar study has been addressed on yhccs. identifying genes involved in both cancer progression and cell dedifferentiation will offer another dimension to pathogenesis mechanisms, as well as providing novel therapeutic targets and prognosis markers. ilf <dig>  is one of the shared top genes between esc and yhcc. lif <dig> is among the ‘core 9’ esc genes highly re-expressed in advanced and poorly differentiated tumors  <cit>  and is a prognostic factor in non-small cell lung cancer  <cit> . another esc gene overexpressed in yhccs is dnmt <dig> and is responsible for the maintenance of dna methylation patterns during replication. inhibitors of this enzyme may potentially lead to dna hypomethylation and re-expression of tumor suppressor genes  <cit> . also, sox <dig> contributes to control wnt/tcf activity  <cit> , crucial in hcc pathogenesis and cancer stem cell renewal  <cit> . targeting these genes or pathways may restrain invasion by yhcc.

in addition to stemness genes, we also filtrated out  <dig> differentiation-related genes from in yhccs. eleven of these genes, including gstk <dig>  and sar1b , are within the top  <dig> most down-regulated genes in yhcc patients . the repressed transcript levels and increased gene expression patterns during esc hepatogenesis implied that these genes might function as novel tumor suppressor genes . gstk <dig> belongs to the glutathione s-transferase  gene family that are critical for detoxification via conjugation of reduced glutathione  with numerous substrates such as pharmaceuticals and environmental pollutants  <cit> . gstp <dig>  another member of the gst family, has recently been identified to be a novel tsg for elderly hccs, and the methylation frequency in gstp <dig> is associated with hcc occurrence  <cit> . roles of gstk <dig> in yhccs tumorigenesis and prognosis, as well as in esc hepatogenesis, are awaited to be elucidated in the future.

CONCLUSIONS
this study revealed the molecular makeup of yhcc and the link between esc traits and hcc subtypes. therefore, molecular mechanisms in elderly hcc patients cannot be simply extrapolated to younger patients. our results also helped to identify transcriptional programs that can be used as potential therapeutic targets for various hcc subgroups.
