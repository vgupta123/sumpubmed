BACKGROUND
the onset and progression of liver regeneration following acute injury reflects a complex program of responses involving growth factors, cytokines, hormones, matrix components and other factors. these extracellular mediators activate a carefully orchestrated sequence of intracellular signals resulting in a system-wide coordinated program of gene expression alterations and associated changes in the functional state of the liver cells  <cit> . following the largely uncharacterized signals that mark the recognition of tissue damage after partial hepatectomy  and the onset of regeneration, which may include hemodynamic changes and stress signals mediated by adrenergic and purinergic agonists  <cit> , hepatocytes emerge from the quiescent  state to enter the pre-replicative phase of the cell cycle   <cit> . the exit from quiescence  is controlled by a wide range of signals from growth factors , cytokines, , interleukin-6) and structural components affected by proteases, such as urokinase plasminogen activator  and matrix metalloprotease- <dig>   <cit> . these and other signals result in the activation of a variety of transcription factors  important during the initial stages of liver regeneration before the onset of de novo protein synthesis and entry into the cell cycle  <cit> . specific tfs, such as nuclear factor-κb , signal transducer and activator of transcription  <dig> , ccaat enhancer-binding protein β , and activator protein  <dig>  are rapidly activated in the remnant liver within minutes to hours after phx  <cit> . these events lead to the first phase of gene expression, referred to as the immediate early phase, which lasts for approximately  <dig> hours in the rat. the protooncogenes c-fos, c-jun and c-myc were among the first genes to be identified in this group  <cit> . previous studies by taub and colleagues identified a large set of genes participating in the immediate early response to phx, which includes transcription factors, tyrosine phosphatases, as well as secreted and intracellular metabolic proteins  <cit> .

characterizing changes in gene expression using microarray technology has provided new insight into the regulation of liver regeneration  <cit> . notably, a broad range of cellular processes appears to be represented among up- or down-regulated genes. although the major emphasis in liver regeneration has been on signals that lead to cell proliferation, the response to phx is much broader. liver cells display a highly dynamic and coordinated response profile that affects almost every aspect of cell functioning  <cit> . however, our understanding of the temporal patterns of gene expression that occur during the course of liver regeneration and of the upstream regulatory signals responsible for these patterns is still limited.

in this study we used cdna microarrays to monitor changes in gene expression at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> h after phx in remnant livers in the rat. these time-points provide information on the course of events during the initiation of the regenerative response accompanying the emergence of hepatocytes from the quiescent state and the onset of the g <dig> phase  <cit> . we adopted a novel approach to analyze the microarray data that extends beyond the list of differentially expressed genes and focuses on the characterization of their transcriptional regulation, which is one of the key mechanisms by which protein expression changes are controlled. candidate tfs responsible for differential expression profiles of the immediate early genes were characterized using the promoter analysis and interaction network toolset  software  <cit> . the concept driving the analysis in paint is that many co-expressed genes share regulatory elements, typically tf binding sites, in their promoters, leading to co-regulation. paint uses bioinformatics in combination with robust statistical approaches to identify the significantly enriched tres in the promoters of the genes of interest . a key aspect of the analysis is the unbiased approach that considers all known tf binding sites as being equally probable for significance to winnow down the list of tfs from hundreds to a relatively small panel of tfs that could play a role under these experimental conditions. based on these results, we characterize the transcriptional regulatory network interactions that drive functional responses during the early phase of regeneration after phx.

RESULTS
liver regeneration function-relevant gene expression
differences in gene expression in rat liver were analyzed at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h after phx corresponding to the transition from g <dig> and the early g <dig> phase in hepatocytes  <cit> . in a typical analysis of high-throughput gene expression data, the choice of false discovery rate  threshold is not objective, i.e., it represents an arbitrary balance between missing relevant genes due to a highly restrictive threshold, and a less restrictive threshold resulting in an increasing number of differentially-expressed genes with more false positives. in contrast, within a certain local fdr range, the number of differentially expressed genes is relatively insensitive to the choice of a particular fdr threshold  <cit> . thus, the local fdr represents a robust metric of the opportunity cost  of considering additional genes as differentially expressed .

analysis of the gene expression time series data using anova resulted in a total of  <dig> genes significantly up- or down-regulated at any of the four time points at a 30% local false discovery rate threshold which corresponded to ~20% false discovery rate  threshold  . sham-operated animals showed only  <dig> genes that were significantly up-or down-regulated at  <dig> hr compared to control tissues . a similar number  of apparently differentially expressed genes was obtained when comparing the data from sets of  <dig> randomly selected control tissues from different animals . notably, the differences in gene expression found after sham surgery or between control samples did not overlap with the genes found to be responsive to phx, suggesting that these represent random differences reflecting multiple testing error or biological variability.

the  <dig> differentially regulated genes were clustered according their expression profiles following the computational negative control  approach detailed in the methods section. six clusters provided maximum information on distinct temporal patterns and were well distinguishable from randomized data partitioning. partitioning beyond six clusters reduces the confidence in the clustering result, as the performance is closer to that of randomized data . it should be noted that there might be additional informative temporal patterns in the data than are represented by the six clusters considered here. one limitation of the clustering algorithm employed here is that the number of clusters is user-specified, and hence, there could be genes that are considered as 'incorrectly clustered' for a given number of partitions. we have attempted to overcome this limitation by scanning a range of user-specified numbers of clusters and choosing the maximum number of patterns that are well distinguishable from clustering randomized data. the expression profiles corresponding to the six clusters are shown in figure 3a. approximately half of the differential regulation is comprised of up-regulation of a number of genes at the  <dig> hour time point . several genes are also down-regulated by  <dig> hours . the early up-regulated genes are represented in clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  and to some extent in cluster  <dig> 

in order to validate the differential expression of key genes across all the observed gene expression clusters qrt-pcr was performed on a total of  <dig> genes that represent the response profiles in the different clusters. the findings, shown in figure  <dig>  indicate a good concordance of the temporal profiles between the microarray and quantitative qrt-pcr results. the difference in scale between the two sets of results is typical, owing to multiple methodological factors  <cit> .

functional categories were assigned to the  <dig> annotated differentially expressed genes based on gene ontology  <cit> , following a manually curated assignment process as detailed in the supplemental data . transcription related genes formed the most numerous category and were present in all clusters . we also observed rapid up-regulation of genes associated with stress response, signal transduction, and cell structure. a large number of cell proliferation-related genes were up-regulated at the  <dig> h time-point . genes in the category metabolism were absent from cluster  <dig>  which shows an early increase that is maintained or declines at later times. the range of functions we observed is expected at the initial stage of liver regeneration  <cit> . a more detailed discussion of the functional gene categories represented in the array studies is provided as supplemental text . it should be noted that we did not find go-based functions that were over-represented  among the differentially expressed genes. hence, we only report the relative frequency of the functional categories .

transcriptional regulatory network analysis
the promoter analysis and interaction network tool  is a software program designed to identify transcription factor binding sites in the promoter region of coordinately regulated genes  <cit> . paint analysis identified  <dig> tf binding sites enriched  in individual clusters with distinct temporal gene expression patterns . the transcriptional regulatory network obtained from the paint analysis is shown in figure 3b. binding sites for several tfs are significantly enriched  in each of the different gene expression clusters. some of these tfs, e.g., nf-κb, hnf- <dig>  creb, atf, gata, and c/ebp are known to be involved in the early phase of liver regeneration from previous studies  <cit> , whereas others  are known to contribute to the regulation of cellular processes related to proliferation and differentiation  <cit> . it should be noted that paint cannot differentiate between different c/ebp isoforms, which have highly conserved bzip domains and interact with identical recognition sequences in the promoter of target genes . the binding site for atf was enriched in the group of genes that are up- or down regulated at the  <dig> h time-point . as for c/ebp isoforms, it is not possible to identify any specific atf component candidate based on binding site information alone, since all members of the atf family bind to the same consensus dna sequence . atf- <dig>  also known as liver-regenerating factor- <dig>  is known to be highly expressed after phx in mice  <cit> ; however, this gene was not present on our array. our microarray analysis identified two differentially expressed members of atf family, namely atf- <dig> and atf- <dig>  the expression profile of these two transcription factors suggests their potential role regulating expression of genes in clusters  <dig> and  <dig> . the binding sites for paired box gene  <dig>  and brn- <dig> were both highly enriched in cluster  <dig> genes. these factors are classically involved in neurogenesis and retinal development and recently pax- <dig> expression was reported in hepatic oval cells under conditions where transdifferentiation into islet cells was promoted  <cit> . however, neither brn- <dig>  nor pax- <dig> have previously been implicated in liver regeneration. the distribution of binding sites in our dataset suggests a role for these transcription factors as possible regulators contributing to the immediate early gene response. binding sites for myogenin, a transcription factor involved in muscle cell differentiation, were enriched in cluster  <dig>  the early response gene btg- <dig> identified in our microarray analysis increases activity of myogenin  <cit> .

activation of transcription factors
in order to corroborate the paint analysis, we obtained time series data on the dna binding activity detected in nuclear extracts from remnant livers for several of the transcription factors implicated by our paint analysis . we selected both transcription factors that had previously been reported to play a role in liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy  and others  that were not known to be involved in this process. the regulatory dynamics we observe is generally consistent with the differential gene expression pattern between  <dig> h and  <dig> h post partial hepatectomy . in particular, the temporal patterns of nf-κb and gata- <dig> activity are consistent with the expression pattern of cluster  <dig> in which the nf-κb and gata binding sites were found to be enriched in our computational analysis. the early changes in pax- <dig> activity also confirmed the potential role of this transcription factor in regulation of some of the immediate-early gene expression . in agreement with earlier reports, an early transient activation of nf-κb, hnf- <dig> and c/ebp-β was observed  <cit> . by contrast, c/ebp-α activity rapidly declined. interestingly, c/ebp-α is suppressed by ap-2α  <cit> , and the increase in the level of active ap-2α we detected at  <dig> h after partial hepatectomy may have contributed to that effect. the differential response of c/ebp-α and c/ebp-β after phx has been documented before and is known to play a critical role in the onset of proliferation under the differentiated conditions of the adult liver  <cit> . such a response is consistent with the temporal expression pattern of genes in cluster  <dig>  in which binding sites for c/ebp were enriched. the transient nature of the c/ebp-β response observed in our samples differs from some earlier reports  <cit> . however, multiple different isoforms of c/ebp-β contribute to its dna binding activity that have differential temporal response patterns  <cit>  and our analysis may be biased towards complexes exhibiting a more transient response.

it is notable that for many of the transcription factors analyzed that show an early transient increase, we observed a significant resurgence in the dna-binding activity between  <dig> h and  <dig> h. such a profile has been observed previously in time course studies of tf activation. for instance, rudnick et al.  <cit>  reported a temporal response of phospho-creb after phx that exactly matches the creb-dna binding profile shown in fig.  <dig>  with a further increase in phospho-creb by  <dig> hrs. similarly, an early, but transient activation of nf-κb followed by a later resurgence was reported by diaz-guerra et al.  <cit> . the resurgence phase coincides with the gene expression profile that suggests a broad range of functional changes occurring between  <dig> and  <dig> hrs after phx. the initial  <dig> hr period after phx has been attributed to the emergence of hepatocytes from g <dig> and the transition to the g <dig> phase of the cell cycle  <cit>  and the  <dig> hr time point reflects the onset of the cell cycle progression.

in addition to the transcription factors identified by our paint analysis, we also monitored activation of stat- <dig>  the activation of this transcription factor after phx was reported in the literature  <cit> . although enrichment of the binding sites for this transcription factor was not identified by paint analysis, we observed a continuous increase in the level of active stat- <dig> in the nuclear extract at 1– <dig> h after phx. in addition, the microarray analysis showed a substantial increase in stat- <dig> mrna level at 4– <dig> h after phx. interestingly stat- <dig> is one of the gata target genes.

functional gene categories regulated by transcription factors
further insight into the functional consequences of the transcriptional regulatory network is obtained from figure  <dig>  which illustrates how the transcriptional regulators relate to functional annotations of differentially expressed gene categories in individual clusters . the strength of the interactions  is shown by thickness of the connecting arrows, and the predominance of individual categories in each cluster  is indicated by the thickness of the borders of each oval. it is apparent that the broad category of transcription related genes are distributed through all of the observed temporal expression clusters and are potential targets for the majority of identified tfs. however, other categories show more differential regulation. interestingly, the two major early response clusters  <dig> and  <dig> show markedly distinct tf-functional category patterns. significantly enriched tf binding sites in cluster  <dig> appear to regulate expression of several cell death-associated genes. induction of both pro- and anti-apoptotic genes is an expected reaction to tissue injury. in cluster  <dig> enriched tf binding sites control a substantial number of genes related to cell proliferation and cell cycle control and also have dominant connections to the stress/immune response genes and the cell structure/cytoskeleton-related genes. in both late response clusters  tf binding sites are enriched that concentrate on process-oriented gene categories such as signaling, stress and immune response, transport and trafficking, or translation.

discussion
in this study, microarray gene expression data obtained during the initial 6-hour period after partial hepatectomy were used to characterize the transcriptional regulatory network that drives the onset and early progression phase of liver regeneration. following clustering of the gene expression data, paint analysis was used to characterize significantly enriched tf binding sites in the different clusters to identify tfs that might have contributed to the temporal profile of gene expression obtained. tf activation could be directly confirmed by analysis of nuclear extracts. insight into the functional role of the genes regulated by these tfs was obtained from the gene ontology analysis of tf-gene relationships. not unexpectedly, the analysis suggests that multiple tfs coordinate to control a wide range of functions during the early phase of liver regeneration . importantly, functional categories identified by go analysis often are broad and overlapping and should be interpreted with considerable caution. for that reason, we curated the individual assignments obtained from the go analysis to optimize the functional associations presented in figs.  <dig> and  <dig>  a more detailed discussion of the functional categories identified in this analysis is provided as supplemental text . in agreement with an earlier study on mice  <cit> , sham-operated animals did not show significant changes in gene expression accompanying the early response to phx that could not be accounted for by multiple comparison errors or animal-to-animal variability and there was no overlap with the differentially expressed genes detected after phx.

several previous studies reported microarray studies of gene expression changes in rodents after partial hepatectomy using a variety of platforms. the majority of these studies presented data on mice, including some that included early time points  <cit> . however, the onset and progression of liver regeneration after phx is considerably slower in the mouse than in the rat  <cit> . reported experimental results vary considerably between studies, both in the number and the nature of genes reported and in the number of replicates, making consistent evaluation of the statistical significance and validation of the resulting changes difficult. therefore, these studies have not generally resulted in broader insights into the functional processes associated with these changes in gene expression. one previous study used the rat model  <cit> , starting with the  <dig> hr time point. however, this study observed significant differences in only  <dig>  genes. thus, our study is unique in presenting a robust analysis of the gene expression changes in the rat and, importantly, in using the temporal response profile to obtain information on the transcriptional regulation that drives these responses.

these results demonstrate that relevant functional information on the transcriptional control of the early response to partial hepatectomy can be obtained from the paint analysis of clustered microarray data. each of the six temporally distinct gene expression clusters is characterized by a unique pattern of significantly over-represented binding sites for tfs. activation of a selection of the candidate tfs was confirmed by oligonucleotide binding assays of nuclear extracts. notably, there was relatively little overlap in the tfs driving the response in different temporal clusters. this is not to say that transcription factors involved in one cluster didn't play any role in the response in other clusters , but those associations didn't reach statistical significance in our analysis. it is possible that these factors contribute to the fine-regulation of the gene expression responses within clusters, but the number of differentially expressed genes in these studies was too low to identify such combinatorial control by multiple tfs with sufficient statistical weight.

as with any computational approach, it is important to note that our unbiased discovery approach using paint, while informative in predicting a role for novel tfs, is subject to false negatives, i.e. not all the currently known tfs in liver regeneration were present in the computational predictions. for example, stat- <dig> is known to play role in liver regeneration  <cit>  and analysis of our samples confirmed that stat- <dig> activation occurred during the time frame of early responses that we investigated here. however, our paint analysis indicates that the differentially expressed genes were not enriched for stat- <dig> target genes . the stat- <dig> binding site is characterized by a position weight matrix of  <dig> base pair length in the transfac database , with a position weight matrix similarity threshold of  <dig>  for minimizing false positives in finding the binding site on genomic sequences. according to the transfac database, this similarity threshold corresponds to a false negative rate of ~20%. hence, the unexpectedly low number of predicted stat- <dig> binding sites may not be due to our choice of parameters in match, but appear to arise from a combination of the pattern matching algorithm and the stat- <dig> binding site description. as the databases and associated computational tools continue to improve, false negatives like these are likely to decrease, although they will probably never be completely eliminated. nevertheless, our computational approach successfully predicted many known and novel tfs as playing a role in the onset of liver regeneration, several of which were experimentally validated .

CONCLUSIONS
our study highlights significant candidate mechanisms for transcriptional control of specific genes and gene clusters and classifies these by functional category, but does not identify individual genes as actively being controlled by these tfs. further studies using chromatin immunoprecipitation  or related methodologies will be required to validate the role of each tf in individual gene responses, which will further clarify the role of individual tfs in the functional changes occurring after phx. nevertheless, the study points not only to the complexity of the transcriptional control of the early response to phx, but also suggests that there is a clear underlying organization to the temporal response of genes in different functional categories that is driven by transcriptional regulation. the data reported here should provide a basis for a more detailed analysis of the role of each of these transcription factors to the regulation of individual genes and gene categories. however, these findings also emphasize the fact that the study of any individual factor will not capture the systemic nature of the regulatory machinery that drives the regenerative response of the liver to partial hepatectomy.

this conclusion is also relevant for the recognition that multiple cell types contribute to regenerative responses in the remnant liver. the analysis of gene expression profiles in total tissue extracts from the remnant liver incorporates contributions from parenchymal cells, kupffer cells, endothelial cells stellate cells and other non-parenchymal cells. although parenchymal cells contribute approximately 70% of the total cell number and 90% of tissue mass in the liver, robust gene expression responses in non-parenchymal cells may occur that reach the threshold for detection in our microarray studies. similarly, differences in zonal distribution across the liver acinus exist that are difficult to capture in such in vivo studies. however, the response to partial hepatectomy  is by nature a systemic response of the whole tissue, in which the contributions of different cell types are integrated to generate the coordinated temporal pattern of regeneration. our analysis is an effort to capture this integrated response profile by focusing on the system-wide gene expression and regulation by transcription factors. a better understanding of this systemic response profile will ultimately be a critical step in mobilizing the regenerative potential of the liver for therapeutic purposes.
