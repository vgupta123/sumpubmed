BACKGROUND
llamas, a member of the camelidae family, produce heavy chain antibodies, a type of antibodies that lack the ch <dig> domain and light chains  <cit> . the antigen binding portion of these antibodies, called vhh, can be expressed at high levels in saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> . vhh antibody fragments have already shown a considerable potential in several biotechnological applications such as decreasing the amount of smooth surface caries in a rat model  <cit> , shortening disease duration, severity and viral load in a mouse model of rotavirus-induced diarrhea  <cit> , and preventing phage infection of lactococcus cells during milk fermentation  <cit> .

virulent bacteriophages infecting lactic acid bacteria  are widely acknowledged as the main cause of milk fermentation failures and they are also responsible for the downgrade of fermented dairy products such as cheeses  <cit> . their ubiquity in dairy environments, biodiversity, and genomic plasticity are largely responsible for the difficulty in controlling phage infection  <cit> . consequently, several tactics have been proposed to curtail their proliferation in industrial settings  <cit> . the generation of phage neutralising vhh antibodies is one of the latest antiviral strategies that have been proposed to inhibit lactococcal phages  <cit> . as a proof of concept, a panel of non-neutralising and neutralising vhh antibody fragments targeting the lactococcal isometric-headed 936-type phage p <dig>  was recently obtained  <cit> . the direct addition of one of them  to milk prevented the infection of the strain lactococus lactis subsp. cremoris c <dig> by the virulent phage p <dig> during the manufacture of a gouda-type cheese  <cit> . the vhh <dig> fragment effectively inhibited lactococcal phage infection by directly binding to the receptor-binding protein  located at the distal part of the phage tail  <cit> . recently, it was shown that other phages belonging to the predominant lactococcal  <dig> species, could also be neutralised by this antibody  <cit> . moreover, some of the non-neutralising fragments, such as vhh <dig>  were shown to bind to the major structural capsid protein  of phage p <dig>  <cit> .

lactobacilli are also gram-positive lactic acid bacteria that normally colonize the oro-gastrointestinal tract  <cit> . some lactobacillus strains are believed to have health promoting properties and are used as supplements in dairy products, either alone or in combination with other microorganisms  <cit> . similarly to lactococcus lactis strains, other carefully selected lactobacillus strains are an integral part of industrial starter cultures that are added to milk for the manufacture of an array of fermented dairy products. thus, their large-scale used in the food industry is well established and their long history of safe use has led to their status as a generally regarded as safe  microorganism. this gras status has led to reports in which lactobacilli were suggested as carriers for passive immunization through surface expression or secretion of various antibodies  <cit> . recently, functional antibody fragments targeting pathogenic bacteria  and a human virus  have been produced in lactobacilli  <cit>  and shown to have an antimicrobial potential.

in this study, we have explored the possibility of producing functional vhh antibody fragments by lactobacilli in order to neutralise lactococcal phages. the in situ vhh production, in a secreted form or anchored to the cell surface, could potentially alleviate the need to add the vhh fragments directly to the fermentation medium, thereby reducing the costs of the technology.

RESULTS
construction of lactobacillus paracasei strains expressing vhh fragments that bind to structural proteins of lactococcus lactis phage p2
we expressed the vhh <dig> single-chain as a secreted product and the vhh <dig> as a surface anchored fusion protein in l. paracasei. this strategy was selected because it was previously shown that the addition of vhh <dig> to a culture medium prevented phage infection while vhh <dig> had no effect  <cit> . however, we reasoned that anchoring vhh <dig> to a cell surface might prevent phage infection by tittering out viral particles present in a medium. first, the vhh2-e-tag and vhh5-c-myc fragments were inserted into the lactobacillus expression vector plp <dig>  respectively generating the vectors plp402-vhh5-secreted and plp401-vhh2-anchored .

the presence of plp402-vhh5-secreted in l. paracasei was found to mediate the secretion of vhh <dig> into the medium . the introduction of plp401-vhh2-anchored into l. paracasei led to the cell surface expression of vhh <dig> by fusion to the c-terminal cell wall anchored domain of proteinase p . in these vectors, the vhh expression is under the control of the promoter of the amy gene . this regulatable promoter is repressed by sugars transported by the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase systems . de-repression of the promoter and protein expression is obtained by growing the cells in the presence of non-pts sugars such as mannitol. both vhh fragments were tagged for detection with anti-e-tag or anti-myc-tag antibodies. the theoretical molecular mass of the anchored vhh <dig> and secreted vhh <dig> is  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda respectively after cleavage of the signal peptide  but containing the n-terminus  of the amylase protein fused to the vhh .

expression of the vhh fragments
vhh expression was analysed by immunoblotting of l. paracasei-transformed strains using monoclonal anti-e-tag antibodies or anti-myc antibodies. the culture supernatant and cell pellet of l. paracasei transformed with the plp402-vhh5-secreted vector contained a protein of  <dig> kda corresponding to the secreted mature vhh . an additional band of approx.  <dig> kda in the supernatant of l. paracasei transformed with the plp402-vhh5-secreted could also be observed, probably resulting from degradation. in all likelihood, the degradation did not occur in the binding part of the vhh but rather in the n-terminal part of the amylase protein fused to the vhh after cleavage of the signal peptide .

the cell extract of l. paracasei transformed with plp401-vhh2-anchored yielded a protein of approximatively  <dig> kda . surface expression of vhh <dig> on recombinant lactobacilli transformed with plp401-vhh2-anchored was analysed by flow cytometry using an anti-e-tag antibody. the transformed plp401-vhh2-anchored l. paracasei strain showed a strong positive signal when stained with the anti-e-tag antibody, whereas the same parental strain transformed with the vector plp <dig> did not show any signal . l. paracasei transformed with plp402-vhh5-secreted did not show any surface expression in flow cytometry . taken altogether, these findings confirm the surface location of the vhh2-e-tag-anchored fusion construct on the cell.

using purified vhh <dig> and vhh <dig> fragments as positive controls, we also estimated that the l. paracasei strain containing the vector plp401-vhh2-anchored expressed about 103– <dig> molecules per cell  while the l. paracasei strain carrying plp402-vhh5-secreted, grown to an od <dig> of  <dig> , expressed about  <dig> ng of vhh fragments per ml of supernatant, corresponding to a production rate of roughly  <dig> ×  <dig> vhh fragments/bacterium/hour.

binding of the expressed vhh fragments to phage p2
binding of the vhh fragments to their respective antigen was analysed by elisa using homogenates of the l. paracasei plp401-vhh2-anchored and supernatant from l. paracasei plp402-vhh5-secreted. both vhh fragments were able to bind to their antigen indicating that they are functional . no activity was observed using extracts and supernatants from cultures of l. paracasei containing only the plp <dig> vector. the lactobacillus strain expressing the anchored vhh <dig> was also mixed with lactococcus phage p <dig> and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy . phage particles were found at the surface of the recombinant lactobacilli expressing the anchored vhh <dig> but not at the surface of l. paracasei containing only the plp <dig> vector .

neutralisation of phage p <dig> by vhh <dig> and vhh <dig> expressed in lactobacilli
finally, the ability of recombinant lactobacillus strains to neutralise p <dig> phages was also studied. a fixed titer of phage  was mixed with supernatant or lactobacillus cells expressing vhh. the supernatant from lactobacillus plp402-vhh5-secreted was shown to neutralise phage p <dig> by binding to its rbp and significantly inhibiting  its adsorption to the host strain lactococcus lactis mg <dig>  in comparison, almost no p <dig> phage particles were bound to the parental l. paracasei strain with or without the cloning vector plp <dig> . interestingly, the surface expressed vhh <dig> was also able to inhibit phage infection of l. lactis cells, albeit to a lesser extent  . thus, even though vhh <dig>  is non-neutralising when added as a monovalent fragment to a culture medium  <cit> , it can neutralise bacterial viruses when anchored at the surface of a lactic acid bacterium. as compared to other anti-phage strategies currently available, the above reported inhibitory effect of vhh  would probably not be considered as a strong anti-phage system . however, lactic acid bacteria producing vhh could be used concomitantly with other strategies to increase the overall protection of starter cultures against phages, thereby providing a novel hurdle to control them.

CONCLUSIONS
it was previously shown that vhh <dig> fragments bind to some but not all 936-like phages  <cit> , which is the most prevalent lactococcal phage group in the dairy industry  <cit> . moreover, it was recently shown that phage mutants no longer neutralised by vhh <dig> could be readily isolated in the laboratory  <cit> . further strategies are thus needed to improve the broadness of the vhh protection and to prevent the emergence of new virulent phages. one possible approach could be the identification of more potent neutralising vhh fragments. alternatively, the expression of multiple vhh fragments could enhance the protection and the applicability of the system. it should be noted that the vhh fragment should preferably be constitutively produced using an expression system devoid of antibiotic selection marker. nonetheless, the proof of concept reported here univocally showed that the expression of anti-phage vhh by a lab represents a novel tool to prevent phage infection. this method would be much more cost effective as the vhh fragments would be produced in situ in the fermentation medium, eliminating the need for additional purification of the vhh fragments.
