BACKGROUND
glucocorticoids  are natural stress-induced steroid hormones, synthesized and secreted by the adrenal cortex. gc plays an important role in the regulation of glucose metabolism and is part of the anti-inflammatory feedback mechanisms of the immune system. in addition to many other immunological and metabolic effects, gc causes cell cycle arrest and cell death in lymphoid cells, an effect that led to the use of gc in essentially all chemotherapy protocols for lymphoid malignancies, particularly childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia   <cit> . unfortunately, gc therapy is not equally effective in all patients. the degree of the early response to gc treatment is a determinant of the intensity of subsequent therapy, and is also a prognostic factor of the overall outcome. therefore, further investigation of molecular mechanisms responsible for gc-induced apoptosis is required to better understand the phenomenon of gc resistance.

it is generally believed that gc exerts most of its effects through the gc receptor , a ligand-activated transcription factor of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. in the absence of ligand, gr resides in the cytoplasm in an inactive multi-protein complex consisting of two hsp <dig> molecules and a number of other proteins, including the immunophilins p <dig> and calreticulin  <cit> . upon ligand binding, the gr undergoes a conformational change that causes dissociation of the multi-protein complex. grs can then form a dimer that translocates into the nucleus, where it transcriptionally activates response genes, generally by binding specific dna sequences known as glucocorticoid response elements . grs can also remain monomers and repress the activity of some transcription factors  <cit> .

microarray technology allows analysis of gene expression on a genome-wide scale, and thus has been extensively used to identify transcriptional response genes in vitro in cell line systems  as well as in chall patients, in vivo <cit>  and ex vivo <cit> . lists of candidate genes have been generated, some of which have been functionally investigated  <cit> , but the exact mechanisms of action of gcs remain to be elucidated. in addition to the widely studied transcriptional regulation, some studies suggested translational regulation by gcs of selected genes , but this question has never been addressed systematically.

“translational profiling” is a technique that combines polysome profiling using sucrose gradient fractionation with microarray technology to estimate translational efficiency on a genome-wide scale. this technique, although not directly measuring translation per se, is widely accepted to estimate the translational efficiency of mrnas  <cit>  and has been shown to provide a useful estimate of protein synthesis  <cit> .

in this project, we performed a genome-wide investigation of translational regulation by gc in chall. comparison of gc regulations in ribosome-bound fractions against gene regulations in the full data set  revealed no significant difference, thus suggesting that gcs do not influence mrna translation, at least in the cell systems analyzed. in addition, our data enables evaluation of the translational efficiency of genes expressed in the investigated systems.

RESULTS
to address the question of translational regulation by gc, two different gc-sensitive cell lines, representing two major sub-types of all, were investigated: the ccrf-cem cell line corresponding to the childhood t-all sub-type, and the nalm <dig> line, corresponding to pre-b all. three independent experiments for each cell line were performed. cells were cultured for 6 hours in the presence or absence of gc followed by classical sucrose gradient fractionation . twenty one to  <dig> different fractions were assigned to one of three pools based on the presence of different ribosomal subunits, referred to as non-translated , intermediate  and translated  pools . while this pooling of fractions from sucrose gradients precludes drawing conclusions on the regulation of translation elongation or termination, it allows analyzing translational regulation at the step of translation initiation. the initiation phase is in fact the rate-limiting step in the process of protein synthesis and also the most common target in translational regulation  <cit> . samples were then hybridized to affymetrix exon  <dig>  microarrays for gene expression profiling, resulting in total of  <dig> microarrays .figure  <dig>

we pre-processed the microarrays using a modified version of the gcrma method  <cit> , which resulted in summarized expression values per transcript probe set. these transcript probe sets were annotated to ids, gene names, transcript biotypes and other information according to the ensembl database version  <dig>  a single “representative” transcript probe set was chosen for genes measured by multiple transcript probe sets on the microarray. our selection prioritized the protein coding transcripts with high numbers of probes and highest average expression throughout arrays . there were a total of  <dig> genes, as defined by the ensembl database, detectable on the microarrays, each represented by a chosen transcript. for further analysis, we restricted the data to presumably expressed genes . for cem-c7h <dig>   <dig> genes were considered to be expressed, and for nalm <dig>   <dig> .table  <dig>

to estimate the translational efficiency of the transcripts, we calculated the relative expression  in each pool using a measure representing the percentage of rna in each of the three pools for the respective gene. we will refer to re in pool  <dig> as translational efficiency of the gene  following the definition in  <cit> . we next selected the top 1% of genes with the highest re in different pools and grouped them according to transcript biotypes, a classification scheme defined in the ensembl database that groups genes or transcripts based on their function or structure. there were  <dig> different biotypes, including protein coding, pseudogene, lincrna etc. the full list of biotypes represented on the microarray, as well as the number of genes of each biotype, are shown in table  <dig>  figure  <dig> shows the presence of different biotypes among the top 1% of genes with the highest re in corresponding pools for the cem-c7h <dig> cell line treated with gc. we observed an enrichment of non-coding biotypes among those with the highest re in pool  <dig>  consistent with the assumption that this pool contained non-translated rna. similarly, among genes with the highest re in pool  <dig>  > 95% were protein coding. both cell lines and both treatments showed very similar results .figure  <dig>

our subsequent analysis focused on protein coding genes, since the translation rate is only applicable to them. there were  <dig> genes investigated in cem-c7h <dig>  and  <dig> in naml <dig>  exploratory analysis of the data indicated that the translational efficiency of protein coding genes varies significantly. distribution of re in pool  <dig> for protein coding genes is illustrated in figure  <dig>  the shape of the distribution for translational efficiency is consistent with results from other studies  <cit>  including a study using a different approach for assessing translational efficiency, i.e., relation of mrna to quantitative proteomics data corrected for protein degradation  <cit> . distribution for the nalm <dig> cell line was narrower around the median, while distribution for c7h <dig> is more widespread. both cell lines skew slightly positive, suggesting fewer genes with very high translational efficiency. distribution of re for gc-treated and etoh-treated samples are nearly the same, implying no global effect of gc on translational efficiency of the genes. as indicated by distribution density function, the majority of genes had their mrna evenly distributed throughout pools. some genes had extremely high translational efficiencies, with up to 97% of their mrna being in pool  <dig>  for example, tln <dig> had an average translational efficiency of  <dig>  in both cell lines, indicating that as much as  <dig> % of its mrna was located in pool  <dig> . on the other hand, some genes appeared weakly translated, if at all. ccdc <dig>  for example, was identified as a poorly-translated protein coding gene with translational efficiency as low as  <dig> , indicating that only  <dig> % of its mrna is associated with ribosomes . the translational efficiencies between c7h <dig> and nalm <dig> cells were highly comparable for genes expressed in both cell lines . the average relative expression and average expression of all genes in the various pools is provided in additional files  <dig> and  <dig> for c7h <dig> and nalm <dig> cells, respectively.figure  <dig>

having determined the translational efficiency for all genes we were now able to address whether genes with similar translational efficiency might also be functionally related. we tested this similar to stevens et al.  <cit>  by dividing all expressed protein coding genes into five groups based on their translational efficiency. on each subset we performed gene ontology  analyses to analyze for enrichment in particular biological processes . the  <dig> gene sets with intermediate translational efficiency did not yield consistent results between the  <dig> cell lines, i.e., enrichment in particular processes was observed in one but not the other cell line. in contrast, in both cell lines the same go terms were enriched in the gene set with the highest translational efficiencies. similar to  <cit> , these included rna processing related terms . genes from the group with the lowest translational efficiencies were also enriched in both cell lines and concerned the go terms “viral transcription” and translation related processes . in agreement with the latter finding, the synthesis of many mammalian proteins associated with the translation apparatus is regulated at the translational level  <cit>  to allow for fast responses to changes in physiological conditions. even in growing cells, the mrna from about 30% of ribosomal proteins, most of which harboring the terminal oligopyrimidine tract  motif, has been described to be sequestered in mrnp particles and thus not being actively translated  <cit> . furthermore, genes with top motifs  had on average slightly lower translational efficiency than all genes . the go results for both cell lines and all groups are provided in additional file 1: tables s <dig> to s <dig> 

next, we assessed whether micrornas  might be involved in determining the translational efficiency of genes. mirnas are major post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression that are thought to bind to specific sites in the 3′ utr of the target gene’s mrna and subsequently repress protein synthesis by destabilizing mrna and/or inhibiting translation  <cit> . mirna mediated inhibition of translation initiation would lead to a decreased expression of the gene’s mrna in ribosome bound fractions compared to the absolute mrna abundance and thus result in a low translational efficiency of the gene. to test for such repressions we analyzed in each cell line the 3′ utrs of the 5% of genes with the lowest translational efficiency for a significant over-representation of binding sites of certain mirna families. note that detection of repression via mrna destabilization, which has been recently proposed to be the major pathway for mirna mediated repression  <cit> , would not be possible with the present translatome data, since it would lead to decreased mrna levels in both ribosome bound and un-bound fractions. among the genes with lowest translational efficiencies we identified, among others, a significant enrichment of mirnas known to be upregulated in lymphoid disorders . many of the poorly translated genes are predicted targets of mirnas from the mirna clusters mir-17 ~  <dig>  mir-106a ~  <dig>  mir-106b ~  <dig>  as well as of mirnas mir-30a, mir-30c, mir-30e, mir-181a, mir-181b and mir-26a. all of these mirnas are known to be over-expressed in all cells or lymphoid malignancies  <cit>  and are also highly expressed in the c7h <dig> cells used in the present study  <cit> . these results suggest that some of the poorly translated genes in c7h <dig> and nalm <dig> cells might indeed be under the control of some highly expressed micrornas. more detailed information is provided in the supplement.

finally, and most importantly, to investigate a possible effect of gc on translation, differential regulation analysis was performed. we defined the translational regulation of a gene as the difference between gc-regulation of ribosome-bound mrna in pool  <dig> and its transcriptional regulation as defined by gc-regulation of the total mrna regardless of the pool . translational regulation was calculated for each gene in each of the three experiments, and moderated t-tests  <cit>  were performed. resulting p-values were adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing using the method of benjamini and hochberg  <cit> . in cem-c7h <dig>  the lowest adjusted p-value was  <dig> , and in nalm <dig>  all adjusted p-values were close to  <dig>  therefore none of the genes had translational regulation significantly different from  <dig> . gc-treatment thus does not affect the translational efficiency of expressed genes in the two chall model systems.

summarizing, the re scores for each gene provided as supplemental data will enable other researchers to evaluate the potential translational efficiency of any gene expressed at the transcriptional level in the all system. when analyzing groups of genes with similar translational efficiency we found for both cell lines enrichments in common biological functions for genes with very high or very low translational efficiencies. furthermore, in an analysis of predicted mirna target sites in the 3′ utr of poorly translated genes, we found also evidence for mirna mediated post-transcriptional gene repression. more importantly, our genome-wide translational profiling showed that gcs do not influence the translational efficiency of expressed genes in the two childhood all model systems investigated.

CONCLUSIONS
it is well established that gc treatment leads to transcriptional gene regulations, a fact that has been extensively studied in various cell systems by us and others. some studies, however, reported an influence of gcs on the translational efficiency of selected genes , most of them analyzed using cell free translation systems  <cit> . here we investigated for the first time the influence of gc treatment on translational efficiency of expressed genes on a genome-wide scale employing sucrose-gradient fractionation based ribosome profiling in combination with microarray analysis of mrna from different fractions. comparison of gc regulation in ribosome-bound fractions versus gc regulation in the full data set revealed no significant differences suggesting that gcs do not directly regulate mrna translation. this, although being a negative result, represents a major finding of importance to the field, since it essentially excludes a potential widespread role of gcs in translational gene regulation, at least in the investigated systems. whether this conclusion derived from in vitro systems extends to the in vivo situations remains to be shown.

in addition, we provide a comprehensive data set with translational efficiencies and average expression of all genes detectable on affymetrix exon  <dig>  microarrays in various pooled fractions from the translatome experiments thus enabling other researchers to evaluate translational efficiencies of their candidate genes in all cells.
