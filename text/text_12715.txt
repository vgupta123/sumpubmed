BACKGROUND
the determination of copy number variants  has become increasingly important for the evaluation of genomic traits in domestic animals  <cit> . cnvs have been shown to be a major source for genetic variation especially in complex traits influencing gene expression, phenotypic variation, adaption and the development of diseases  <cit> . analyses using different detection methods have been performed in diverse species like cows, pigs and horses  <cit> . recent whole-genome sequencing revealed  <dig> cnvs in a quarter horse mare and suggested cnvs to be an important resource for future studies of complex diseases and traits in horses  <cit> . cnv studies for horses were carried out by the array comparative genomic hybridization  methodology and the cnv detection algorithm penncnv using whole genome snp genotyping chips  <cit> . both techniques have been shown to be a valid method to detect cnvs  <cit> . it was proposed that a comparison between these methods might be an important step for understanding the advantages and disadvantages of these platforms  <cit> . snp arrays were proposed to be advantageous due to lower prices, lower signal-to-noise ratios and the use of the parameter b-allele frequency which facilitates the interpretation of results  <cit> . furthermore, less samples per experiment were assumed to be required for snp genotyping compared to cgh analyses  <cit> . however, the main bias for snp arrays was considered to be the low snp coverage of the genome in regions of cnvs due to difficulties of assay development and implementation  <cit> . in cgh arrays the genome coverage was shown to be highly dependent of the study design. in pig breeds cgh analyses have been proposed to be advantageous due to an enhanced marker density and a uniform distribution of probes  <cit> . cnv analyses in horses were performed on a cgh array which only targeted exons and therefore did not allow an identification of cnvs in intergenic regions  <cit> . this was taken into account for the benefit of detecting smaller cnvs in coding exons of annotated genes  <cit> .

cnv calls in cgh as well as snp arrays have been considered to be highly dependent on the algorithms used for the identification of cnvs  <cit> . for snp arrays, various cnv detection programs have been available. comparative analyses of cnv detection algorithms suggested that multiple predictions from different detection programs increased the confidence in the data and helped to eliminate false positive results  <cit> . nevertheless the accuracy of cnv detection by different algorithms has also been shown to be limited due to false negative results  <cit> . snp array analyses in horses have not been performed in more than one cnv detection algorithm yet  <cit> . on the other hand, the analysed horse populations varied from a low number of horses  of diverse breeds used in the cgh study, to a higher number of horses  of a few breeds  in snp array based penncnv detections  <cit> . due to the development of the horse population into a highly variable group, evaluations of different breeds have been shown to be important, especially for complex variations which are supposed to be challenging due to genetic heterogeneity and variations in the phenotypic expression  <cit> .

genome-wide association studies  for height have been performed for cnvs in human and revealed copy-number variants that were proposed to play a role in the development of short stature  <cit> . recent studies in horses identified cnvs in the region of genes mainly involved in sensory perception, signal transduction and metabolism but also in candidates for neuronal homeostasis, coat colour, blood group antigens, keratin formation and height  <cit> . a quantitative trait locus  for stature was found on equine chromosome   <dig> at 75 mb. size variation in horses has been investigated in various gwas for single nucleotide polymorphisms  using beadchip data  <cit> . on the whole, five loci on eca <dig>  eca <dig>  eca <dig>  eca <dig> and eca <dig> have been discussed to be probably involved in the determination of withers height. a functional polymorphism on eca <dig> was shown to be highly associated with body size and with the relative expression levels of the adjacent gene ligand dependent nuclear receptor corepressor-like  <cit> . it was assumed that lcorl might be a main regulator for the determination of body size in horses.

the aim of this study was to perform cnv detection analyses in accordance with current standards using three cnv detection algorithms in a large number of horses of various breeds and to compare these results with current microarray studies. the cnvs detected were further analysed for their association with body size as a model for complex traits.

RESULTS
cnv detection
the detection of cnvs was performed on the data of the illumina equine snp <dig> beadchip using the algorithms cnvpartition , penncnv  <cit>  and quantisnp  <cit> . analysis revealed  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cnvs using these programs for the detection . the mean size for all detected cnvs was  <dig>  bp and the median  <dig>  bp. considering the distribution of cnvs over the chromosomes, the detection results of penncnv revealed the largest number of cnvs on eca <dig>  eca <dig> and eca <dig> while the results of quantisnp showed an enrichment of cnvs on eca <dig>  eca <dig> and eca <dig> . detection analysis by cnvpartition revealed a high number of detected cnvs on eca <dig>  eca <dig> and eca <dig>  however, the chromosomes with the highest numbers of cnvs did not necessarily show the highest coverage with cnv regions. we found strong cnv coverage enrichment on eca <dig> , eca <dig> , eca <dig> and eca <dig>  and eca <dig> . across all three detection algorithms, eca <dig> was not only significantly enriched by cnvs but also showed the largest number of detected cnvs. an accumulation of cnvs has also been reported in cgh analyses in horses for eca <dig>  eca <dig> and eca <dig> and was shown in illumina equine snp <dig> beadchip based penncnv analyses for eca <dig>  eca <dig> and eca <dig>  <cit> . we assume that the amount of detected cnvs on specific chromosomes is dependent on the detection method and can vary among different populations. nevertheless, there is much evidence to presume that eca <dig>  eca <dig> and eca <dig> are considerably enriched for cnvs.

the proportion of the chromosome covered by detected cnvs is shown.

comparison between three detection programs
comparative analysis between the algorithms showed that penncnv and quantisnp detected similar numbers of cnvs identified on each autosome. they displayed a cnv detection overlap of  <dig> % and  <dig> % . the percentage of cnvs overlapping with cnvpartition, the algorithm with the lowest number of detected cnvs, was  <dig> %  and  <dig> % . in total,  <dig> cnvs could be detected by all three programs . the average size of these  <dig> cnvs detected by all three programs was  <dig>  bp and ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp . the number of losses and gains was computed among those breeds that revealed a cnv in all three algorithms . on the whole, five cnvs showed higher copy numbers in some and lower copy numbers in other horses while further  <dig> cnvs only displayed losses and  <dig> cnvs only gains in these horses.

comparisons between our detection results of the  <dig> cnvs detected in all three programs with recent cnv studies  <cit>  showed that these  <dig> cnv regions were highly similar to those cnv regions in previous studies especially for snp array analyses . nevertheless, the study by dupuis et al. revealed a considerably higher number of detected cnvs  <cit> . we propose that this effect was a result of more stringent quality criteria and the combination of three detection algorithms used in our study.

overlapping cnv regions from each study are shown in base pairs. copy number  and number of samples are displayed for all studies.

cgh analyses showed less concordance with our detection events. it was proposed that the results of cgh and snp arrays were generally not easily comparable  <cit> . in particular, the cnv-study designs in horses were different, as cgh analyses only targeted exons, while the snp arrays covered the whole genome. furthermore, our analysis was performed on a considerably higher number of samples that might allow a more general view on the distribution of cnvs in the horse population. comparisons between the cnv regions detected by cgh analyses and those identified by the three snp array detection algorithms individually revealed a relatively high overlap with the detection results of quantisnp , less consistency with the penncnv results  and an extremely low overlap with cnvpartition . despite the relatively low overlap in total, penncnv showed concordance up to 100% in some chromosomal regions. these comparisons confirm the assumption that the prediction accuracy of cnvpartition seems to be relatively poor due to the high rates of missed events  <cit> . we suppose that this was the reason for the considerably high number of detected cnvs by individual programs in comparison with the number of overlapping detection events. a closer look at each algorithm showed that penncnv and quantisnp provided a similar distribution of cnvs over the chromosomes and had a considerably higher number of detection events in comparison with cnvpartition. penncnv and quantisnp are both hidden markov model  based algorithms that use the log r ratio and b allele frequency independently  or in combination   <cit> . comparative analyses of cnv detection methods for snp arrays confirmed that penncnv and quantisnp had a large overlap of detection events  <cit> . a study of bladder cancer in human which used a study design similar to ours suggested penncnv and quantisnp to be a more reliable method for the detection of cnvs than cnvpartition  <cit> . quantisnp was even assumed to be the best of these three methods and also outperformed the other algorithms  <cit> .

all cnv regions that show an overlap of at least 50% with the cnv region detected by cgh are displayed for each chromosome. the highest overlap can be seen with quantisnp.

cnv sharing among breeds
after filtering out samples with low call rate and quality features we were able to detect cnvs in  <dig> horses. the total number of detected  cnvs was  <dig> for these horses of different breeds. due to the choice of unrelated horses, we supposed this number of cnvs gives a good view on the distribution of cnvs in the horse population with the restriction that different numbers of samples were available per breed. comparative analysis of all three algorithms revealed  <dig> cnvs that could be detected in all programs for the same breed. these cnvs were found in arabian, hanoverian, holsteiner, lusitano, maremanno, oldenburg, thoroughbred, westphalian . with regard to the individuals we could confirm  <dig> cnvs that were detected in the same horse using all algorithms. theses cnvs ranged in size from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp and showed an average size of  <dig>  bp. further  <dig> cnvs showed an overlap among different breeds .

the total number of cnvs, the number of cnvs derived from the  <dig> cnvs of all three detection programs  and the number of animals which showed these cnvs in at least one algorithm is displayed. the last two columns show the more stringent category with the number of cnvs that were detected in the same horse in all three algorithms and with the number of horses under these conditions.

on the whole  <dig> breeds shared their cnv with another breed .

comparisons between the  <dig> cnvs derived from all three detection algorithms showed that the largest number of cnvs occurred in the hanoverians, supposably due to the largest number of samples used in this study. on the whole  <dig> hanoverian specific cnvs could be detected. two of these showed gains and losses in different horses . in general, only one cnv derived from the comparative analysis of three detection algorithms showed losses and gains among different breeds. this cnv was located on eca <dig> at  <dig> - <dig>  mb and showed losses in hanoverian and lusitano and gains in holsteiner and thoroughbred horses.

furthermore a relatively high number of cnvs shared with the hanoverian could also be found in oldenburg, westphalian and holsteiner, presumably due to the close relationship among these breeds. a cnv overlap between arabian, lusitano and maremanno horses could be explained by the strong influence of the arabian and lusitano bloodlines on the maremanno breed. in addition, we investigated the distribution of cnvs in two przewalski horses and detected on the whole  <dig> cnvs which could not be identified by all three detection algorithms but showed an overlap with different breeds . we assume that these cnvs might be conserved for a long time and passed on during the domestication of the horse.

evaluations of the individual horses showed that most horses shared their cnvs with at least another animal according to previous observations  <cit> . comparing the average size of cnvs detected in more than one animal  with the size of cnvs not shared by a second horse  confirmed the suggestion that cnv sharing among horses is correlated with cnv length as larger cnvs are more likely to be shared  <cit> .

analysis of genes within cnv regions
analysis of genomic regions of  <dig> cnvs, derived from comparative analysis of cnv detection algorithms, revealed  <dig> different genes within  <dig> cnvs. in five cnv regions we were not able to find any functional gene. the major category of genes consisted of olfactory receptor  genes , a group of genes which is known to be significantly enriched in cnv regions in human, cattle, pig and rat  <cit> . it was supposed that the overrepresentation of or genes is not a result of positive selection but of the frequent appearance of these genes in segmentally duplicated regions  <cit> . these regions are known to be more susceptible to cnvs while genomic regions with dosage-sensitive genes usually show a low number of cnvs  <cit> .

functional analysis was performed using human orthologs of the horse genes due to the poor annotation of the horse genome. the results of the database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery   <dig>  showed an enrichment of  <dig> genes involved in sensory perception, signal transduction and cellular components . the highest p-values could be observed for the classifications olfaction , olfactory receptor  and sensory perception of smell . further analyses with the panther classification system revealed statistically over- and underrepresented biological processes and confirmed the overrepresentation of genes involved in sensory perception  and signal transduction as well as response to stimuli . processes involved in cell cycle, transcription and metabolism were underrepresented.

the software panther was used for the evaluation of  <dig> cnv regions detected by all three algorithms. in five cnv regions we could not detect any genes for evaluation.

analysis of the molecular functions demonstrated significantly overrepresented processes concerning receptor activities and particularly underrepresented catalytic and hydrolase activities . the panther protein class analysis showed a comparatively reduced number of nucleic acid binding, transferase and hydrolase proteins. our results suggest that cnv regions are not randomly distributed among the genes of the horse genome, but they harbour certain genes overrepresented in those regions while other genes involved in specific biological processes are underrepresented. similar distributions were observed in cattle and in cgh array analyses of  <dig> horses, showing sensory perception and signal transduction to be the primary processes affected by cnvs  <cit> .

furthermore, an enrichment of genes involved in metabolic processes was also observed in cgh analyses of horses  <cit> . our study revealed an impoverishment of cnvs in regions of genes responsible for a metabolic process. this term is defined by panther as chemical reactions and pathways by which living organisms transform chemical substances. a closer look at our analysis of metabolic pathways shows that primary metabolic processes, protein metabolic processes, nucleobase, nucleoside, nucleotide and nucleic acid metabolic processes were underrepresented while the cyclic nucleotide metabolic process was overrepresented. we assume that metabolic process is a very general term and has to be interpreted in context of more specific ontology terms for metabolic processes. furthermore, we suppose that the high number of horses used in our study in comparison with previous cgh analysis might give a more general view on the distribution of enriched and impoverished genes in cnv regions. similar to our results, human cnv studies revealed a significant underrepresentation of genes involved in nucleic acid metabolism in deletion regions  <cit> . furthermore, enriched gene categories concerning sensory perceptions of smell, chemical stimuli, smell and taste as well as neurophysiological processes, brain development, immune responses and external biotic stimuli could be shown in human  <cit> . it was assumed that the underrepresentation of genes occurs due to the strong selective pressure for genes involved in important processes like transcriptional regulation and development  <cit> .

association analysis with body size
gwas for body size was performed for each algorithm on basis of its cnv detection results and for the intersection of all three detection programs. a highly genome-wide significant peak on eca <dig> could be shown for the data generated by penncnv  and quantisnp . analysis of the intersection of  <dig> cnvs revealed a p-value at the threshold of significance  presumably influenced by cnvpartition which did not reveal any significant association. the associated cnvs were deletions in the region of 156 mb . they were located in the area of the candidate genes olfactory receptor  <dig>  subfamily k <dig> , subfamily k <dig> , subfamily n <dig>  and subfamily m <dig> . gwas for copy number variation in human revealed the syntenic region of  <dig> - <dig>  mb to be significantly associated with stature  <cit> . it was proposed that individuals with short stature show an excess of lower-frequency deletions  <cit> . our analysis revealed the heterozygous deletions on eca <dig> to be associated with larger sized horses.

the chromosome-wide  and genome-wide corrected significant p-values  of the associated cnv regions detected by plink for the different algorithms and the number of animals showing a cnv in this region are given. for the intersection of three detection programs the p-value at the threshold of significance is displayed. cnvpartition did not show any significant association.

a second cnv region, with the highest association for body size , was located on eca <dig> at  <dig> - <dig>  mb. all these heterozygous deletions could be found in larger sized horses and were absent in smaller horse breeds. the peak region harboured the candidate genes immunoglobulin lambda variable 3– <dig> , variable 3– <dig>  and variable 2– <dig>  which all belong to the immunoglobulin lambda light chain variable gene cluster, which is important for immunoglobulin structure  <cit> .

a third candidate region could be detected by quantisnp on eca <dig>  at  <dig>  mb. this cnv showed deletions for  <dig> larger sized warmblood horses. the neighbouring candidate genes opioid receptor, kappa  <dig>  and atpase, h + transporting, lysosomal, 50/57-kd, v <dig> subunit h  have been shown to be associated with body conformation in pigs  <cit> . vacular-type h + atpase proton pump is a complex located in the ruffled border plasma membrane of bone-resorbing osteoclasts and is important for bone resorption. mutations or deletions in v-atpase subunits encoding genes have been shown to decrease resorptive activity in bones  <cit> . further candidate genes in the region of the associated cnv are the v-yes- <dig> yamaguchi sarcoma viral related oncogene homolog , the trimethylguanosine synthase, s. cervisae, homolog of  and the pleiomorphic adenoma gene  <dig> . genome scans for sequence variants in human revealed these genes to be in the region of snps with the strongest correlation for height in a meta-analysis  <cit> . the candidate gene plag <dig> is known to be involved in developmental processes  <cit> . its influence on bovine stature could be shown by variants modulating the expression of a chromosome domain encompassing plag <dig> <cit> . a targeted disruption of plag <dig> in mice caused early growth retardation which was maintained throughout adult life  <cit> .

our results showed that body size in horses is mainly associated with homozygous or heterozygous deleted cnvs on eca <dig>  eca <dig> and eca <dig>  these regions do not correspond with the region of the potential main regulator lcorl or further associated snps or cnvs for body size in horses  <cit> . we assume that the associated cnvs detected in our analysis might represent additional regulators in the complex process for the determination of height.

the association of the cnv regions on eca <dig> and eca <dig> could be confirmed by two detection algorithms, while the peak region on eca <dig> was exclusively detected by quantisnp. the illumina-based algorithm cnvpartition did not reveal any association for body size although the associated cnvs on eca <dig> and eca <dig> could be detected by all three programs. we assume that the generally low number of detected cnvs in only few horses were the reason for the missing association. for this reason we propose that cnvpartition did not allow an appropriate association analysis due to the high false negative rates. this correlates well with our analysis for the detection accuracy of each algorithm. the results demonstrate certain limitations that have to be considered for the use of multiple predictions. it was proposed that analyses of different detection algorithms have to be taken with care due to false negative events but are also useful to avoid false positives caused by noisy data and call attention to discrepancies in the data  <cit> . penncnv and quantisnp were shown to be more reliable in detecting cnvs than cnvpartition  <cit> . our analysis confirmed this suggestion and showed that not only the number of compared cnv detection events but also the choice of the program is important for an effective analysis.

qpcr validation
for validation of detected cnvs we performed qpcr analysis in two cnvs on eca <dig> and one cnv on eca <dig> for twenty horses each . we chose three cnv regions that were detected by all three programs of which two were associated with body size and one was also validated in horses of previous analysis  <cit> . all three cnv regions could be confirmed by qpcr . the rate for the accurate copy number detection of at least one algorithm was 95% for olfr <dig>  on eca <dig> and 80% for iglv3- <dig>  on eca <dig>  for the cnv region on eca <dig> at the candidate gene or4k <dig>  all horses could be validated. the results show that the analysed cnvs could be validated although few horses did not show the copy number detected by snp chip analysis. similar analyses in pigs revealed accurate discovery rates of 71%  <cit> .

considering the individual programs, the false negative discovery rate of cnvpartition was particularly high, while quantisnp showed the lowest false negative discovery rates in all three cnv regions . we assume that these results underline our comparative analyses for the detection algorithms showing quantisnp to be the most reliable and accurate program.

in addition to this validation, we compared cnvs of previous cgh analyses that were validated by qpcr with our detection results. on the whole, four previously verified cnvs could be confirmed in our analysis. one of these cnvs was rare in our population and could only be detected by quantisnp and cnvpartition, further three cnvs could be found in a considerably higher number of horses by quantisnp and also by penncnv in contrast to cnvpartition . this comparison helps to verify our cnv detection results in these regions and confirms the assumption that there are significant differences in the detection abilities of the analysed algorithms. we conclude that a validation of detected cnvs is crucial especially for further analyses of associated regions, and helps to evaluate the accuracy of the detection results by specific programs.

CONCLUSIONS
the aim of our analysis was to investigate three different algorithms for the detection of cnvs in horses and to find associated cnvs for the regulation of body size. comparative analysis of the detection programs in  <dig> horses revealed  <dig> cnvs with an average size of  <dig>  bp. functional analysis of genes located in these cnvs confirmed the high amount of or genes  and showed an overrepresentation of genes involved in sensory perception, signal transduction and cellular components while cell cycle, transcription and metabolic processes were underrepresented.

we conclude that in general the creation of an intersection of three cnv-programs is useful to increase the accuracy of cnv detection and to reduce the number of false positive results. nevertheless, the comparison between these programs also provides a strong restriction and a higher number of false negative results which is highly dependent on the choice of the detection tool. we recommend taking advantage of the different algorithms used in detection programs and to perform multiple predictions in a first step. such an analysis will show possible limitations and establish suitable algorithms for further evaluations. in our study the combined use of penncnv and quantisnp was most effective for the accurate detection of cnvs. gwas for the cnv detection results of these algorithms identified for body size three homozygous or heterozygous deleted cnv regions associated with larger sized horses on eca <dig>  eca <dig> and eca <dig>  two of these regions were analysed by qpcr and could be validated. we conclude that a comparative cnv analysis is a useful approach as it reveals the limitations of individual programs and helps to estimate the reliability of the detection results.
