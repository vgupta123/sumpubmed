BACKGROUND
larches  are major tree species of northeast asia boreal forests  <cit> . the role of larix spp. in the boreal forest ecosystem is noteworthy because of its ability to grow on poor soils and on steep slopes prone to erosion and mass wasting, and its ability to withstand extremely cold winter temperatures while tolerating periodic summer-time forest fires common to the region  <cit> . larix gmelinii   populates large, climatically diverse areas, and is one of the most economically and ecologically important tree species in northeast china, due to its excellent water resistance and anti-corrosion properties . for its long life span and extreme diversity of growth conditions, l. gmelinii is ravaged by a large number of herbivorous insects and pathogenic fungi, and a number of specialized insects are causing substantial losses to both natural and plantation forests, in particular during outbreak periods.

genomic sequences available for l. gmelinii are scarce. currently , there are  <dig> ests and  <dig> nucleotide sequences available on ncbi for l. gmelinii.

the transcriptome is a total set of transcripts, mrna and non-coding rna in a population of cells for all expressed genes. the transcriptome analysis lays the foundation for gene structure and function research. next generation sequencing  technologies such as rna-seq using illumina platform have applications in many research fields including re-sequencing, micro-rna expression profiling, dna methylation and have been utilized extensively for model  <cit>  and non-model  <cit>  organisms. to date, ngs has been used to sequence gymnosperm transcriptomes including, pinus taeda, picea sitchensis and taxus <cit> . despite the obvious potential, researchers have not utilized ngs methods to study l. gmelinii disease/insect-resistance gene expression. we adopted the solexa illumina sequencers platform in sequencing the l. gmelinii to develop genomic resources for studies. sequencing the transcriptome of l. gmelinii will provide a repository of genomic sequences for researchers studying l. gmelinii and improve our understanding of the functions/mechanisms of disease/insect-resistance genes and secondary metabolites in l. gmelinii.

jasmonic acid  and its volatile derivative methyl jasmonate , collectively called jasmonates, are plant stress hormones that have regulatory functions as signalling molecules in higher plant development and adaptation to environmental stress  <cit> . jasmonates activate host defense responses against a broad spectrum of herbivores. although it is well established that ja controls the expression of a large set of target genes in response to tissue damage, very few gene products have been shown to play a direct role in reducing herbivore performance  <cit> . exogenous application of meja results in major reprogramming of defensive gene expression in plants, inducing induction of chemical defenses, and effects similar to the ones induced by mechanical or herbivore damaged plants  <cit> . a number of genes that are known to be involved in plant stress responses are induced by ja treatment. ja induces the expression of genes encoding proteinase inhibitors , which are involved in the protection of plants from insect damage  <cit> . cdna macro-array analysis revealed that meja treatment induced expression of several genes involved in ja biosynthesis, oxidative burst, stress-related and programmed cell death  <cit> . while defensive-associated signal has been extensively studied in angiosperms  <cit> , it is a little-known in conifers. in conifers, biochemical changes induced by application of meja are similar to those induced by wounding, insect herbivore feeding, and pathogen invasion  <cit> . in our research presented here we studied expression of the genes related to induced resistance from l. gmelinii treated with ja and meja. prior to this report, changes in protective enzymes, secondary metabolites and volatile compounds in l. gmelinii needles induced by ja or meja treatment were studied by our team  <cit> . in order to understand the impact of ja and meja on l. gmelinii at the transcriptional-level, the analysis of differentially expressed genes  using digital gene expression was conducted. the differential gene expression profiles might provide an invaluable resource for the investigation of molecular mechanisms in l. gmelinii disease/insect-resistance and their potential defensive signals.

RESULTS
high-throughput transcriptome sequencing and reads assembly
l. gmelinii gene expression profiles were constructed from cdna synthesized from plants treated with ja and meja, and then sequenced with the illumina sequencing platform. we obtained  <dig> , <dig> short reads by sequencing. q <dig> percentage  and gc content were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. these reads were assembled with soapdenovo  <cit> . our results revealed  <dig>  contigs, the longest assembled sequences containing no ns. by mapping reads back to contigs and combining paired-end information, contigs were linked into scaffolds.  <dig>  scaffolds were assembled. unknown bases were filled in with ns. after filling gaps in scaffolds by using paired-end reads, we obtained  <dig>  unigenes  with mean unigene size being  <dig> nucleotides  . additional file  <dig> indicates that the number of sequences with matches in the non-redundant  ncbi nucleotide database is greater for the longer assembled sequences.

functional annotation
annotation of predicted proteins
protein functions can be predicted from annotation of the most similar proteins in nr, swiss-prot, kegg and cog databases. we matched unigene sequences against two protein databases, nr and swiss-prot, and obtained  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes respectively . distinct gene sequences were first searched using blastx against the nr database using a cut-off e-value of  <dig> e- <dig>  the number of identified genes  based on the above cut-off value is not large because of the relatively short length of distinct gene sequences  and lack of genomic information on l. gmelinii.

the proportion of sequences with matches in the nr database was greater among the longer assembled sequences than shorter sequences. over 98% of sequences longer than  <dig>  bp or between  <dig>  to  <dig>  bp, matched gene sequences in the nr database. the matching efficiency of the sequences between  <dig>  to  <dig>  bp were  <dig> %, and those longer than  <dig>  bp were  <dig> %. for sequences between  <dig> to  <dig>  bp, the matching efficiency decreased to  <dig> %. for those ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bp matching efficiency decreased to  <dig> % .

the e-value distribution of the top hits in the nr databases showed that 27% of the mapped sequences have a strong homology , whereas 73% of the homolog sequences ranged between  <dig> e- <dig> to  <dig> e- <dig>  the similarity distribution had a comparable pattern with 10% of the sequences having a similarity higher than 80%, while 49% of the hits had a similarity ranging from 51% to 80%. for genus distribution,  <dig> % of the distinct sequences had top matches  with sequences from arabidopsis, followed by the oryza , picea , zea  and populus . we matched unigene sequences against the nr database and  <dig> % of these unigene sequences matched to model organisms  .

clusters of orthologous groups  classification, gene ontology  and kegg
overall,  <dig>  sequences out of  <dig>  nr hits, had a cog classification . among the  <dig> cog categories,  <dig>  genes  fell into the cluster for general function prediction only.  <dig>  gnes  fell into the cog transcription category.  <dig>  genes  were categorized as having a role in the posttranslational modification, protein turnover and chaperones cog group.  <dig>   of genes fell into the replication, recombination and repair cog group. cell motility, extracellular structures and nuclear structure cog groups contained the fewest genes .

we obtained gene ontology  functional annotation according to the nr annotation. based on sequence homology,  <dig>  sequences were categorized into  <dig> functional groups . we found in each of the three main categories  of the go classification that metabolic process, cell part & cell and catalytic activity are dominant functions, respectively; we also noticed a high-percentage of genes from the categories binding, organelle and cellular process, and only a few genes from the functions of locomotion, cell killing, virion and virion part .

in total, we assigned  <dig>  sequences to  <dig> kegg pathways as shown in table  <dig>  the pathways most represented by the unique sequences were metabolic pathways , biosynthesis of secondary metabolites , spliceosome , phenylpropanoid biosynthesis , starch and sucrose metabolism  and flavonoid biosynthesis . these annotations provide a valuable resource for investigating specific processes, functions and pathways in l. gmelinii genes.

we believe that genes in the kegg categories metabolic pathways and starch and sucrose metabolism play a significant role in plant growth and development. pathways such as flavonoid and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis are important in plant stress resistance. phenylpropanoids are a group of secondary plant metabolites derived from phenylalanine and function as structural and signaling molecules. phenylalanine is first converted to cinnamic acid by deamination, which is followed by hydroxylation and several methylation steps to generate coumaric acid and other acids with a phenylpropane  unit. reduction of the coa-activated carboxyl groups of these acids result in the synthesis of corresponding aldehydes and alcohols. the alcohols are called monolignols, and are starting components for the biosynthesis of lignin. these simple phenolic compounds are important in plant defense against fungi and herbivorous insects. as a result, phenylpropanoid metabolic pathways play an important role in plant growth, development and defense responses against pathogen and herbivore attacks  <cit> .

protein coding region  prediction
in total,  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes were predicted by blastx and estscan, respectively. the histogram as seen in additional file  <dig> showed the length distribution of cds predicted by blast and estscan. in general, as the sequence length increases, the number of cds is gradually reduced. this is consistent with unigene assembly results  <cit> .

digital gene expression  library sequencing
an immediate application of our transcriptome sequence data includes gene expression profiling from treatment with ja and meja. we used the dge method which generates absolute rather than relative gene expression measurements and avoids many of the inherent limitations of microarray analysis. we sequenced three dge libraries: uninduced control  vs. ja, ck vs. meja, and generated between  <dig>  and  <dig>  million raw tags for each of the three samples . after removing the low quality reads, the total number of tags per library ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  million and the number of tag entities with unique nucleotide sequences ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . heterogeneity and redundancy are two significant characteristics of mrna expression. a small subset of mrnas have very high abundance, while the majority of transcripts had a low level of expression. therefore, the distribution of tag expression can be used to evaluate the normality of the dge data. the distribution of total and distinct tags, different tag abundance categories showed similar patterns for all three dge libraries . low-expression tags with copy numbers smaller than  <dig> occupied the majority of distinct tag distributions . to evaluate the reproducibility of dge library sequencing, we used pearson correlation analysis for every two samples to indicate the reliability of our experimental results as well as operational stability .

mapping sequences to the reference transcriptome
to study the molecular events behind dge profiles, we mapped tag sequences of the three dge libraries to our reference database generated in the aforementioned illumina sequencing, est sequences and nucleotide sequences from ncbi. this reference database contains  <dig>  unigene,  <dig> est and  <dig>  nucleotide sequences. after removing redundant genes, we obtained  <dig>  reference genes including  <dig>  genes with catg sites and  <dig>  reference tags. between the  <dig>  and  <dig>  distinct tags generated from the illumina sequencing of the three libraries,  <dig>  to  <dig>  distinct tags were mapped to a gene in the reference database . tags mapped to a unique sequence are the most critical subset of the dge libraries as they can explicitly identify a transcript. unique tags  could unequivocally identify  <dig> %  of the sequences in our transcriptome reference tag database. to confirm if the number of detected genes increases proportionally to the number of sequence reads , a saturation analysis was performed. additional file  <dig> shows a trend of saturation where the number of detected genes almost ceases to increase when the number of reads reaches  <dig> million. next, the level of gene expression was determined by calculating the number of unambiguous tags for each gene and by normalizing this to the number of transcripts per million clean tags . as summarized in additional file  <dig>  results show that transcribed mrna for the majority of genes was present in fewer than thirty copies and only a small proportion of genes were highly expressed.

distribution of dge tags on genes
we found that approximately 80% of the tags mapped to a ctag site , this is probably due to the incomplete nlaiii digestion during library preparation and the usage of alternative polyadenylation and/or splicing sites  <cit> . detection of multiple tags with high abundance for a predicted transcript indicates the reliability of the transcript sequence  <cit> . furthermore, the information obtained from multiple tags per transcript is valuable for the verification of ab initio gene predictions.

changes in gene expression profile induced by different elicitor treatments
to identify a significant change in gene expression by different elicitor treatments, the differentially expressed tags between two treatment samples  were identified by an algorithm developed by audic et al.  <cit> .  <dig>  tags with significantly altered expression were detected between the ck and ja l. gmelinii libraries. filtered with fdr≤ <dig>  and |log2ratio|≥ <dig>  these tags were mapped to a total of  <dig>  genes of which  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig>  were down-regulated . in addition, a total of  <dig>  tags with significantly altered expression were detected between ck and meja of l. gmelinii libraries, which mapped to  <dig>  genes,  <dig>  genes were up-regulated and another  <dig>  were down regulated . the total number of differentially expressed genes between ck and meja  is larger than that of ck and ja . roughly the same number of down-regulated genes  were detected under the conditions produced by two elicitors. furthermore, we analyzed the differentially expressed genes between every two sample dges , and found that less than 40% of the differentially expressed genes are orphan sequences, with no homologues found in the ncbi database. next, we analyzed the  <dig> most strongly expressed genes between the two treatments  and identified nine up-regulated genes and four down-regulated genes present in both treatments . therein some highly expressed genes are involved in many important biological pathways, for instance, the tpms of unigene <dig>  in ja and meja treated plants are  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, and are involved in six pathways, namely, “metabolic pathways”, “biosynthesis of secondary metabolites”, “flavonoid biosynthesis”, “phenylpropanoid biosynthesis”, “stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid and gingerol biosynthesis” and “phenylalanine metabolism”. these highly expressed genes probably have important biological functions and should be investigated in future studies .

functional annotation of differentially expressed genes
to understand the functions of differentially expressed genes, functional go enrichment analysis was executed in order to determine major biological functions of degs between the two treatment samples  . we found that oxidoreductase activity was the most significantly enriched go-term of molecular functions in degs between ck vs. ja and ck vs. meja. “cytoplasmic part” was the most significantly enriched go-term of “cellular component” and lack of the go-term of “biological process” in degs of the sample ck vs. ja. by using functional go enrichment analysis, the result showed that “plastid part” was the most significantly enriched go-term of “cellular component”, and “cellular cell wall organization” of “biological process” was the same in degs for ck vs. meja sample. different genes usually cooperate with each other to exercise their biological functions. pathway-based analysis helps to understand a gene’s biological functions.

kegg is the major public pathway-related database. we mapped all of the genes to terms in kegg database, and compared this with the whole transcriptome to search for enriched genes involved in metabolic or signal transduction pathways. among the genes with kegg pathway annotations,  <dig> differentially expressed genes were identified in ck and ja libraries, and  <dig> in ck and meja libraries. pathway enrichment analysis identifies significantly enriched metabolic or signal transduction pathways in degs by comparison with the transcriptome background. pathways with qvalue≤ <dig>  are significantly enriched in degs. these results showed that  <dig> pathways were significantly enriched in degs of ck and ja, including “metabolic pathways”, “protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum”, and so on . notably, specific enrichment of genes was observed for pathways involved in energy and organic compound biosynthesis or metabolism, such as the oxidative phosphorylation, photosynthesis, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and pyruvate metabolism .

upon wounding, fungal infection or insect attack, conifer trees respond with lesion formation, cell death and the accumulation of constitutive and induced phenolics and terpenoids in the affected areas  <cit> . this is hypersensitive response and the release of toxic chemicals may restrict and possibly kill invading insects and fungal pathogens. the induced activation of polyphenolic parenchyma and traumatic resin ducts, which are formed in response to the attacks, further enhance conifer defense capacity against the current threat and additional attacks  <cit> . several genes involved in phenylpropanoid pathway produce lignin, flavonoids and other phenylpropanoid phytoalexins  <cit> , these genes in the phenylpropanoid pathway of conifers and their involvement in defense mechanisms have also been characterized  <cit> . many phenolic compounds play an important function/role in plant defense against attacks by fungi and herbivorous insects and are synthesized through pathways, most notably, the shikimic acid pathway, is the most pivotal pathway. phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan are also synthesized through the shikimic acid pathway. phenolic compounds are produced from these amino acids via a series of hydroxylation, methylation and dehydration reactions through the phenylpropanoid synthesis pathway. the phenylpropanoid pathway also plays a role is synthesis of defensive compounds  <cit> . phenolic secondary metabolites have been proposed to play a role in conifer defence against pathogens and potentially insects as well  <cit> . we noticed that in the phenylalanine biosynthesis pathway, the gene expression of 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase and shikimate dehydrogenase was up-regulated by meja treatment and was down-regulated by ja treatment. the gene expression of aspartate transaminase was down-regulated simultaneously by ja and meja treatment. the effect of ja was stronger than meja . there were  <dig> genes expressed in the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway, which were found by sequencing the l. gmelinii transcriptome from needles induced by ja or meja. the  <dig> genes were phenylalanine ammonia-lyase , cinnamate-4-hydroxylase , p-coumarate-3-hydroxylase , ferulate-5-hydroxylase , 4-coumarate coa ligase , caffeoyl-coa o-methyltransferase , cinnamoyl-coa reductase , cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase , beta-glucosidase, peroxidase, shikimate o-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase, coniferyl-alcohol glucosyltransferase, coniferyl-aldehyde dehydrogenase and sinapate 1-glucosyltransferase. this result is consistent with the involvement of this pathway in pinus sylvestris defense against heterobasidium annosum and in picea sitchensis , against mechanical wounding or feeding by choristoneura occidentalis or pissodes strobi <cit> . most of the annotated transcripts likely have a different function, among which the genes were identified only in angiosperms to be involved in the biosynthetic pathway  <cit> . among the  <dig> genes,  <dig> can be found in the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway of p.sitchensis phloem induced by fungus or insect feeding or mechanical damage  <cit> . the  <dig> genes of hydroxycinnamoyl-coa shikimate/quinate hydroxycinnamoyltransferase  and caffeic acid o-methyltransferase  were not expressed in induced l. gmelinii, but were expressed in induced p. sitchensis. the  <dig> genes of beta-glucosidase, peroxidase, shikimate o-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase, coniferyl-alcohol glucosyltransferase, coniferyl-aldehyde dehydrogenase and sinapate 1-glucosyltransferase were expressed in induced l. gmelinii, but were not detected in the induced p. sitchensis <cit> . in gymnosperms from different genera, the enzymes involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway may induced by a stimulus. different stimuli may cause expression of different enzymes.

the genes of pal and enzymes which catalyze formation of coumaric acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid and sinapic acid, such as trans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenase, coumarate 3-hydroxylase and coniferyl-aldehyde dehydrogenase, were expressed in both induced l. gmelinii and p. sitchensis <cit> . it is similar that the induction trend of the phenylpropanoid pathway by ja or meja treatment and in spruce exposed to herbivory, and highlights common response of the phenylpropanoid pathway to stresses in conifer. pal catalyzes the first reaction of the phenylpropanoid pathway and has been shown to increase in response to stress from wounding or fungal elicitors in pine cell cultures and trees  <cit> . pal is also associated with the initiation of phenolic metabolism including biosynthesis of lignans and lignins  <cit> . we also found that the expression of pal gene was significantly higher in l. gmelinii treated with ja or meja than the control, and the expression was greater when treated with meja than ja. this result was consistent with our previous results  <cit>  and similar to the results of meja-treated arabidopsis <cit> , and treated hairy roots of daucus carota <cit> . pal is highly expressed in poplar leaves and expression increases after insect feeding  <cit> . the invasion of the fungus ceratocystis polonica causes induced activation with enrichment of pal at the plasma membrane of phenolic pp cells in picae abies <cit> . these previous studies are consistent with our results. ja, meja and fungal infection are able to increase expression of pal.

the gene expression of trans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenase and coniferyl-aldehyde dehydrogenase which catalyze the synthesis of coumaric acid and ferulic acid in l. gmelinii was down-regulated simultaneously after being induced by ja and meja. expression of coumarate 3-hydroxylase, which is required for synthesis of caffeic acid, was up-regulated in meja treatment samples. in ja treated samples coumarate 3-hydroxylase is down-regualted, which contrasts with previous results from our team that the caffeic acid, ferulic acid and coumaric acid content increases in induced l. gmelinii needles  <cit> . future studies are required to determine if post-transcriptional level is involved .

several studies indicate that glucosinolate and its degradation products play an important role in plant resistance against herbivores, insects and pathogens  <cit> . in the glucosinolate biosynthesis pathway, up-regulated genes responsible for transferase activity and transferring glycosyl groups or glucosyl transferase were induced by ja and meja treatment. stronger induction occurred in plants treated with ja.

it is well known that the alpha-linolenic acid metabolic pathway is involved in ja synthesis and is also a signaling pathway that induces the expression of protease inhibitors  <cit>  and other plant defense genes  <cit> . alpha-linolenic acid metabolic pathway is octadecanoid pathway of plant in response to those induced by wounding, insect herbivore attack and pathogen invasion feeding revealed of putatively involved. gene expression analysis of p. sitchensis in response to p. strobi feeding revealed an increased expression of genes putatively involved in the octadecanoid pathway  <cit> . the ability of meja to induce defense responses, similar to those elicited by wounding, insect feeding, and fungal inoculations, is consistent with the role for octadecanoid signaling in induced conifer chemical defense. lipoxygenase  is a key enzyme in this pathway  <cit> , allene oxide synthase  is the first enzyme of the lox synthesis pathway, whereas allene oxide cyclase  is the key enzyme of ja biosynthesis. we found that even though the gene expression of lox, aos and aoc in l. gmelinii is up-regulated by both two elicitor treatments, again, the quantity of expression in ja treated plants is greater than that in meja. lox is highly expressed after insects feed on nicotiana tabacum, and lox activity in populus simonii × p. pyramidalis ‘opera 8277’ leaves increased after clostera anachoreta feeding  <cit> . the relative expression of lox was significantly higher in arabidopsis and solanum lycopersicum treated with meja than the control  <cit> . similarly, these gene expressive levels were increased after meja treatment in p. sitchensis <cit> . these findings in angiosperm and p. sitchensis are consistent with our results. in order to verify a subset of the dge tag data by a third independent technology, quantitative reverse transcriptase pcr  analysis were conducted. the  <dig> genes expressed in phenylpropanoid pathways under different elicitors treatment were studied by using real-time qrt-pcr. the results showed a similar direction between dge and qrt-pcr in induced by ja and meja . qrt-pcr analysis confirmed the direction of changes detected by dge analysis.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we sequenced the l. gmelinii transcriptome and used it to study gene expression of disease/insect-resistance genes in trees induced with ja or meja. several disease/insect-resistance genes were identified. part of these defense genes were also found in p. sitchensis induced by biotic and abiotic stress  <cit> . a few genes associated with induced chemical defense against insects were recorded in genbank of spruce, larch and other gymnosperms . our transcriptome and digital gene expression emphasized the potential importance of ja and meja on l. gmelinii induced defense, as well as the role of phenolic secondary metabolite pathways, specifically the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway.

a single run produced more than  <dig>  unigene sequences, from which  <dig>  sequences had a blast result based on e-value less than  <dig> e- <dig>  these findings provide a substantial contribution to the gene sequence resources for l. gmelinii gene research and will likely accelerate research of disease/insect-resistance related genes on l. gmelinii. the present digital gene expression library will guide in the selection of genes for their further functional characterization.
