BACKGROUND
meiosis is a key process in the life cycle of higher plants during which recombination occurs, leading to novel combinations of parental alleles. many of the meiotic genes that are well characterized to date are directly involved in the meiotic recombination machinery and identifying the entire set of meiotic genes is an on-going process. in the well-studied model dicot plant, arabidopsis thaliana, around  <dig> genes involved in meiosis have been functionally characterized  <cit> . in crop plants there are few well-characterized meiotic genes, but attempts have been made in maize, rice, wheat and barley to generate a comprehensive atlas of meiotic genes corresponding to well-characterized homologs from other organisms  <cit> . several transcriptome studies using whole anthers have been performed in species such as arabidopsis  <cit> , petunia  <cit> , rice  <cit> , hexaploid wheat  <cit>  and maize  <cit> . studies on multiple stages during anther development have yielded valuable data on transcriptome dynamics and stage-specific transcripts  <cit> . in addition, some studies have helped to elucidate the meiotic transcriptome by comparing meiotic mutant anthers to wild-type  <cit> .

however, these studies examined transcriptomes of whole anthers, which, while technically much less challenging than isolating meiocytes , does not distinguish between meiocyte gene expression and gene expression in the various other tissues of the anther. comparison with meiotic mutant anthers improves this but can suffer from distortion in tissue composition and in gene expression caused by the mutation. to gain insight specifically into the transcriptome of meiocytes, recent efforts involved techniques for isolation of pure meiocytes. obtaining early meiocytes from plants is possible by using ccm , in which meiocytes are collected with a microcapillary  <cit> . in these studies, mrna of isolated arabidopsis meiocytes at stages ranging from prophase i to tetrads was analyzed using expression microarrays  <cit>  or next-generation sequencing  <cit> . these studies found that a large number of arabidopsis genes were expressed during meiosis  <cit> . interestingly, meiocytes also showed substantial expression of transposable elements  <cit>  as well as high levels of transcripts mapping to a mitochondrial genome insertion  in the nuclear genome  <cit> . while these studies were based on pooled cells from all meiotic stages, no study has previously examined specifically the early meiotic transcriptome within isolated meiocytes. early steps of meiosis during meiotic prophase i are the stages when spore mother cells have left the mitotic cell cycle and entered the meiotic cell cycle, and chromosomes start to pair and recombine  <cit> . these processes are critical for the success of meiosis. identifying genes and processes that are specifically enriched is important for understanding the molecular mechanisms of regulation in early meiosis, recombination initiation, and gamete formation.

in this study, we took advantage of the synchrony of development that exists in the male inflorescence  in maize  to collect large quantities of meiocytes at leptotene and zygotene sub-stages of prophase i. we took a closer look at the early meiotic transcriptome of isolated meiocytes with two main objectives: first, we wanted to complement previous studies with a list of meiotic gene candidates in maize, reporting their expression level in both isolated meiocytes and anthers. our second goal was to take a more general approach and reveal important processes during early meiosis beyond those directly involved in the conserved process of recombination.

RESULTS
gene expression profile of isolated male maize meiocytes
we used ccm  followed by rna extraction and illumina sequencing to generate transcriptome profiles of isolated meiocytes at the leptotene and zygotene stages of prophase i, whole anthers containing meiocytes at the same stages, and two-week old seedlings of maize . each transcriptome was generated in two biological replicates, correlation coefficients between the replicates being  <dig>  ,  <dig>  , and  <dig>  . rna yield ranged from  <dig> - <dig>  μg, and total sequenced reads from  <dig> ,210- <dig> , <dig>  with at least  <dig> , <dig> reads aligning uniquely . a correlation dendrogram, generated by hierarchical clustering using the ward method in jmp genomics shows that paired biological replicates correlate best with each other . there is also a high correlation between anthers and meiocytes  and the correlation of our biological replicates is especially obvious when comparing the early prophase meiocyte and anther samples with additional premeiotic meiocyte and anther samples .

above a threshold of  <dig> reads per million mapped reads,  <dig>  genes were expressed in meiocytes,  <dig>  in anthers, and  <dig>  in seedlings, with ~79-86% of them common to all samples ; for numbers of genes in case of  <dig> or  <dig> rpm and a comparison with equivalent arabidopsis data see  <cit> . few genes were uniquely expressed in one sample, namely 2% of meiocyte genes, 3% of anther genes, and 16% of seedling genes . note that anther samples contain meiocytes, which likely contributes to the small number of differentially expressed genes  between anthers and meiocytes; substantially more differentially expressed genes were found between anthers or meiocytes vs. seedlings . high congruence of anthers and meiocytes in the expression heatmap also clearly sets them apart from seedlings .

since nearly 85% of the maize genome consists of transposable elements   <cit> , we analyzed differential te expression in meiocytes, anthers and seedlings. in contrast to their relative genomic abundance, annotated tes contribute only ~12% to global expression, while annotated genes contribute ~80%, averaged across all data sets; reads originating from regions of the genome not present in the reference or reads whose quality is too poor to allow alignment make up the remaining portion . we conducted a thorough analysis for te expression in meiocytes  and detected a preference for ltrs of the  unknown te superfamily and a strong bias in chromosome origin of tes expressed at higher levels during meiosis : most meiosis-specific tes originated from chromosome  <dig>  and substantially more tes originating from the mitochondrial genome were detected than in non-meiosis-specific tes . the over-representation of the  unknown te superfamily as well as of chromosome  <dig> derived tes is due to “ipiki” family tes , of which many are up-regulated, some up to ~200-fold in meiosis-specific tes.  <dig> out of  <dig> ipiki elements are located on chromosome  <dig>  on the distal part of the short arm, distal to the nucleolus organizer region. in addition, we noticed an increased occurrence of te families previously reported as highly expressed in meiotic or mitotic tissues by vicient et al.  <cit>  in our meiosis-specific tes, especially giepum, cinful and flip .

subjecting all genes expressed per sample to functional annotation using mapman  <cit>  shows that difference between functional category distributions among the samples is minimal . the only difference is seen in genes related to photosynthesis and secondary metabolism, which are enriched in seedlings . no differences are apparent between anthers and meiocytes in this approach.

subjecting genes up-regulated in our samples to mapman for an overview of functional terms , on the other hand, showed obvious differences. most functional categories enriched in anthers are also enriched in meiocytes alone, in accordance with their similar expression profiles . genes up-regulated in whole anthers vs. seedlings show enrichment for genes involved in chromatin packaging and organization, transcription, rna biosynthetic processes, as well as regulatory processes . furthermore, common to the transcriptomes of anthers and meiocytes is a high prevalence of genes implicated in energy production, such as glycolysis, fermentation, tca , and mitochondrial electron transport . genes up-regulated in seedlings are enriched for those involved in photosynthesis, opp , cell wall and lipid metabolism, secondary metabolism, and nitrogen and sulfur metabolism .

detailed go analysis of genes up-regulated in meiocytes
to gain deeper insight into processes during early meiosis, we extended our functional analysis for genes up-regulated in meiocytes using agrigo . analysis of up- or down-regulated genes did not yield significant go  terms for comparisons between meiocytes and anthers. all other comparisons returned multiple significant go terms .

genes up-regulated in meiocytes vs. seedlings are enriched for a few significant go terms  including energy- and mitochondria-related processes and various regulatory mechanisms, such as redox homeostasis and chromatin modification. the most significantly enriched go term in the meiocytes vs. seedlings comparison is “cellular carbohydrate metabolic process”. other go categories enriched in meiocytes vs. seedlings are “localization” , “signaling” , “dna repair” , “proteolysis” , and “glycosylation” . besides these highly significantly enriched go categories, “chromatin” , “rna”  and “homeostasis”  are also significantly enriched in meiocytes vs. seedlings but to a lower extent.

*terms also enriched in list of genes designated as meiocyte genes.

we designated a group of  <dig>  genes as meiocyte genes using the following criteria defined previously by chen et al.  <cit> : gene expression level in meiocytes at least 2-fold higher than in anthers , or, for genes expressed at least two-fold higher in meiocytes and anthers compared to seedlings, less than 4-fold in anthers vs. meiocytes . overall,  <dig> genes met the first criterion, and  <dig>  met the second criterion. most  genes of the first group were also present in the second group, yielding  <dig>  genes in the combined list. subjecting these genes to go analysis with agrigo  <cit>  identified more enrichment for terms related to “nucleosome assembly” and “dna packaging” and several additional enriched go terms related to “carbohydrate metabolism” and “localization” .

abundance of mitochondrial transcripts during early meiosis
we detected a large number of mitochondrial-functioning genes as highly expressed in isolated meiocytes vs. both anthers and seedlings . these transcripts originated from genes present in the nuclear genome as well as the mitochondrial genome.  <dig> out of the  <dig> genes up-regulated in meiocytes vs. anthers were mitochondrial-encoded, which is a significant proportion considering there are only  <dig> identified genes in mitochondria in maize  <cit>  vs  <dig>  genes in total . in support of the mitochondrial origin of these transcripts, a close examination of mitochondrial transcripts in our dataset revealed c → u rna editing . via a comprehensive snp analysis on the mitochondrial chromosome, we detected g → a and c → t transitions, which both translate into c → u rna editing, differing only in their strand origin . we carried out a refined approach which only targeted c → u conversions in annotated genes  and found that up to ~2% of c’s were edited .

 <dig> out of  <dig> nuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded genes for components of the mitochondrial electron chain were up-regulated in meiocytes compared to seedlings while only  <dig> were down-regulated,  <dig> of those encoding alternative oxidase ; genes encoding metabolite transporters did not show an expression bias in meiocytes vs. seedlings.

expression level of meiotic gene candidates
we generated a list of meiotic gene candidates in maize using a list of arabidopsis thaliana genes known to be involved in meiosis compiled from data of  <cit>  and  <cit> . to find homologs of these genes in maize, the arabidopsis genes were submitted to a gene family search using phytozome . putative maize homologs were selected according to the presence of similar domains and further examined regarding their expression levels in the maize rna-seq dataset. of the  <dig> putative maize meiotic gene candidates some but not all were found to be highly up-regulated in meiocytes:  <dig> were expressed at least 5-fold higher in meiocytes than in seedlings, but only four genes were expressed at a level of 2-fold or greater in meiocytes vs. anthers . in general, good indicators for a meiotic gene candidate in our maize dataset are 1) at least 5-fold higher expression in meiocytes than in seedlings , or, as in arabidopsis  <cit> , 2) at least 2-fold higher expression in meiocytes/ anthers vs. seedlings, while expression in anthers is less than 4-fold that of meiocytes .

a
as/m ratio >  <dig>  bs/m ratio >  <dig>  cm/a ratio >  <dig> 

mus <dig> is an example of employing these criteria to meiotic function candidate genes to support the selection of the best candidates for function in meiosis: grmzm2g <dig> has the lowest expression in the meiocytes sample, while grmzm5g <dig> has an almost 10-fold ratio in meiocytes vs. seedlings and an almost 2-fold ratio in meiocytes vs. anthers. other examples, such as rad51d show a pronounced increase in expression in meiocytes vs. seedlings, and rad51a <dig> and rad51a <dig> <cit>  are also highly expressed in meiocytes vs. seedlings, but to a lesser extent. detection of rad51a <dig> and rad51a <dig> confirms the feasibility of the approach using phytozome, though not everything can be detected, e.g. for the arabidopsis swi1/dyad gene the search found the maize paralog am <dig> but not ac <dig> _fg <dig> although they stem from a duplication event  <cit> .

validation of gene expression and its importance in meiocytes by rna in situ hybridization, real-time rt pcr and in silico analysis
a previous similar approach in arabidopsis also identified genes important for meiosis  <cit> , and was followed up by a promoter study to prove the meiocyte-specific expression of candidate genes  <cit> . here, we choose multiple approaches to verify the gene expression patterns detected in the rna-seq data. to extend the analysis to detection of tissue specificity we selected several genes for further analyses using rna in situ hybridization and real-time rt-pcr. the example genes we chose contained a well-known meiosis gene as a positive control, mitochondrial-encoded genes which have been found to be of interest in this study, and genes expressed at low levels in order to ascertain their expression pattern. the genes selected for rna in situ hybridization included dmc <dig> , nad <dig> , grmzm2g <dig>  and grmzm2g <dig> . rna in situ hybridization results for dmc <dig> and nad <dig> indeed showed that both genes were strongly expressed in anther lobes . the signals were especially strong in premeiotic and leptotene anthers, and were concentrated in areas where the meiocytes develop, but not in the connective tissue between anther lobes. the occurrence of dmc <dig> expression before the onset of meiosis has been reported before, for example in wheat  <cit> . in zygotene, the signals were more confined to meiocytes. dmc <dig> was also expressed in the tapetum .

rna in situ hybridization with grmzm2g <dig> and grmzm2g <dig> showed expression in tapetum cells in zygotene anthers. in addition, grmzm2g <dig> was expressed throughout anther lobes in premeiotic and leptotene anthers, comparable in strength with dmc <dig> and nad <dig> . however, in situ hybridization is better used as a relative quantitative method for comparing tissues in a sample, but might not be the tool of choice to compare between the expression strength of different genes due to e.g., hybridization strength differences . real-time pcr and rna-seq data are usually in good agreement and can help to decide if unique or apportioned counts better reflect the actual expression levels .

to verify expression levels of the selected genes, we also performed real-time pcr of cdnas from whole anthers at premeiotic, zygotene and pollen stages . samples included the four genes examined with in situ hybridization and two additional mitochondrial-encoded genes, ccmfn  and rnapol . the results were similar to those obtained from in situ hybridization, including strong dmc <dig> expression in early stages and almost undetectable level of grmzm2g <dig> in premeiotic-stage anthers .

to verify not only the expression of genes detected as preferentially expressed in meiocytes but also their importance, we analyzed the generated gene list for the presence of named maize genes, interpro descriptions and meiosis candidate genes . twenty of our meiosis-candidate genes were contained in the list, most notably am <dig> and phs <dig> which have already been shown in maize to be involved in meiotic recombination and whose loss results in male sterility  <cit> .

discussion
previous studies have addressed the important question of the meiotic transcriptome in plants: microarray-based approaches in maize, petunia, wheat and rice  <cit>  examined different developmental stages of anthers and provided valuable information on transcriptome dynamics and genes specific to certain stages. these and other studies aided in identifying meiotic genes in arabidopsis, maize, barley and rice. here we complement these efforts by providing a comprehensive atlas of meiotic gene candidates in maize, together with the expression level in isolated early meiocytes. another goal of our current study was to take advantage of our data from isolated meiocytes, to detect processes vital in early meiosis as indicated by transcript abundance. by sequencing the transcriptome of isolated maize meiocytes at leptotene and zygotene, we generated an expression profile of early meiotic prophase i in plants.

isolated meiocytes and whole anthers had very similar expression profiles, which is not surprising since whole anthers contain meiocytes. a previous study suggested that maize meiocyte rna contributes up to 20% of whole anther rna  <cit> . they based their calculation on data from rice  <cit>  and arabidopsis  <cit> , estimating  <dig> times  and  <dig> times  more rna than in typical diploid cells  <cit> . in maize, pmcs constitute less than 1% of the total anther cells but because they are large   <cit> , the use of whole anthers to obtain information about meiotic transcriptomes had been justified. our data now unveils that the contribution of meiocytes to the whole anther transcriptome landscape might be far greater than previously assumed, at least in maize. with this in mind, previous transcriptome anther data can be reanalyzed, and future rna level studies aiming at the meiotic transcriptome can reasonably use whole anthers instead of isolated meiocytes. nevertheless, using isolated meiocytes yielded unprecedented resolution and novel insights into specific expression patterns. furthermore, for dna-based experiments, the contribution of meiocytes to whole anthers is far lower and the use of meiocytes is strongly suggested.

abundance of mitochondrial transcripts in meiocytes
unlike arabidopsis in which significant differences in the gene expression landscape were detected between meiocytes and anthers  <cit> , isolated meiocytes and whole anthers of maize had very similar expression profiles. we detected a significantly increased amount of mitochondrial transcripts in early prophase i meiocytes, which would not have been obvious from whole-anther data. organelle transcripts have been encountered in other transcriptome studies before  <cit>  but are usually dismissed without further explanation, or regarded as artifacts  <cit> . according to the classical view, polya selection during library preparation should indeed remove most mitochondrial mrnas. however, the classical view of stabilizing 3′polya only on transcripts from the nucleus and transient degradation-targeting external and internal polya on transcripts in bacteria and organelles was recently challenged by diverse studies  <cit> . a strong increase of poly-adenylated transcripts from mitochondrial genes was detected in recent arabidopsis studies connected with enhanced thermotolerance  <cit>  and some plant studies on development have encountered elevated transcript levels of specific mitochondrial genes  <cit> . explanations range from gene dosage effect to transcriptional activation to higher stabilization, but the molecular basis and significance are not elucidated.

in plants, there is an ongoing shuffling of mitochondrial genome segments to the nucleus, leading to numts , which can occur via insertion of the entire or parts of the mitochondrial genome  or of processed transcripts   <cit> .

the question has to be posed whether the mitochondrial gene transcripts detected in our rna-seq arose from numts  or directly from the mitochondria. we detected a high proportion of edited mitochondrial transcripts in our rna-seq data which points to mitochondrial origin. approximately one-third of the genes that are highly expressed in meiocytes vs. anthers are encoded in mitochondria, but nuclear-encoded genes with functions in mitochondria are also up-regulated in meiocytes vs. seedlings. we hypothesize that this is an indication of a high energy demand during early prophase i, when vigorous chromosome movement occurs  <cit> . consequently, our data indicate that genes encoding proteins involved in the glycolysis step and the mitochondrial electron transport chain show significantly increased expression levels in meiocytes. a few studies from other organisms also point to the importance of mitochondrial processes for the meiotic pairing process, namely in caenorhabditis elegans and schizosaccharomyces pombe where chromosome pairing or recombination was dependent on mitochondrial respiration  <cit> . the functional requirement of mitochondrial genes for meiosis or post-meiotic processes is highlighted by the phenomenon of cytoplasmic male sterility, which is due to mutated mitochondrial genes and has been reported in maize and other plants  <cit> . despite those clues for the importance of mitochondria-located processes for meiosis, both previous arabidopsis meiocyte transcriptome studies had not pointed this out. not explicitly mentioning any mitochondria genes up-regulated in meiocytes, yang et al.  <cit>  still listed the  <dig> most enriched pfam families including mito-carr , and tpr_ <dig> and tpr_ <dig>  which can be found in the nadph oxidase subunit and as receptor of mitochondrial import proteins. chen et al. <cit>  noted the increase of transcripts from mitochondria origins, but attributed it to a mitochondrial genome insertion  because the reads mapped to this region. a new analysis, comparing arabidopsis and maize data generated in our lab recently revealed that the abundant transcripts in arabidopsis also originated directly from the mitochondrial genome  <cit> .

redox homeostasis and chromatin modification during early meiosis
two groups of genes that are highly expressed in meiocytes also deserve closer attention. one is “homeostasis", encompassing genes encoding thioredoxins and glutaredoxins. the redox status has recently been postulated to be a determinant of cell fate in pre-meiotic anther development  <cit> . a central key player in establishing germ cell initiation is msca <dig>  <cit> , which encodes a glutaredoxin and is also on our list of “homeostasis” genes whose expression is up-regulated in early meiosis, together with two other putative glutaredoxins and five thioredoxins . thioredoxins are ubiquitous disulfide regulatory proteins that seem to link redox status to cell fate and growth during development in multicellular organisms  <cit>  and in arabidopsis, thioredoxin trx h <dig> even appears to be capable of cell-cell-migration and communication  <cit> . the detected redox regulator candidates might not only be required for establishment of germ cells but also for maintaining, progressing and especially synchronizing the meiotic process later on.

the other enriched process group is “chromatin”, indicating that expression of chromatin-related genes may represent a link to meiotic recombination. for example, histone  <dig> lysine  <dig> trimethylation  marks double strand break hotspots in mouse  <cit> , and histone acetylation is often linked with recombination-active regions  <cit> . our data provides a list of candidates for meiosis-specific histone modifiers that might influence recombination, including two set domain proteins and two proteins from the histone deacetylase superfamily .

protein localization and degradation
we also found processes connected with molecule targeting, localization and proteolysis significantly enriched in meiocytes. while some genes implicated in localization processes might be due to the abundant mitochondrial transcripts, there is also a connection with proteolysis-related components. ubiquitination is mostly associated with proteolysis, has diverse roles in plants and is important for regulating growth and development, reviewed in  <cit> , with a non-degradative function in regulating cellular localization and activity, reviewed in  <cit> . monoubiquitination is implicated in regulation of membrane transport and transcriptional processes  <cit> , making the genes up-regulated in meiocytes involved in these processes also interesting candidates for further studies.

CONCLUSIONS
the generated early meiosis-specific transcriptome dataset of maize is a valuable resource for understanding the meiotic program. using it, we were able to reveal novel and under-acknowledged aspects of early meiosis such as high energy production, er-connected processes, and rna regulation. in addition to identifying new meiotic gene candidates, this dataset can be useful for distinguishing between genes functioning in meiocytes vs. other tissues of the meiotic anther to provide insight into the interaction between meiocytes and somatic cells of the anther. taken together, future studies could aim to investigate how the processes detected herein are connected and which regulatory roles they play to direct events during early meiosis.
