BACKGROUND
cardiac outflow tract  formation involves complex signaling and cell interactions, in which the neural crest plays a central role  <cit> . neural crest cells  delaminate from the dorsal neural tube and migrate along distinct pathways to their final destinations, where they differentiate into a plethora of cell types including melanocytes, cranial cartilage/bone, vascular smooth muscle cells  and peripheral neurons. cardiac nccs, a subpopulation of nccs from the dorsal neural tube between the mid-otic placode and the third somite, migrate and populate in pharyngeal arches  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and contribute to patterning of the pharyngeal arch arteries. a subset of cardiac nccs continue migrating into the heart and are required for oft septation  <cit> . perturbation of cardiac ncc development causes congenital heart defects, including digeorge syndrome. however, the molecular mechanisms underlying ncc and oft development are incompletely understood  <cit> .

multiple signaling pathways are implicated in cardiac ncc development, including bone morphogenetic protein , transforming growth factor β <dig> , notch, wnt and platelet-derived growth factor . mutation of individual genes in these pathways variably affects ncc migration, proliferation, smc differentiation and survival, leading to a spectrum of oft abnormalities  <cit> . tgfβ <dig> signaling is required for smc differentiation and extracellular matrix  deposition. ablation of tgfβr <dig> or tgfβr <dig> leads to increased cell death within the oft  <cit> . mice deficient for bmp receptor alk <dig> exhibit impaired ncc migration into the proximal oft and smc differentiation  <cit> . deletion of smad <dig>  a common downstream mediator of tgfβ and bmp signaling, in cardiac nccs leads to increased cell death in the pharyngeal arches and reduced nccs within the oft  <cit> . double deletion of pdgf receptors leads to reduced migration of cardiac nccs into the proximal oft and persistent truncus arteriosus   <cit> . however, mutation of each of the aforementioned genes has minimal effects on cardiac ncc delamination and initial migration into the pharyngeal arches and oft.

ncc migration involves changes in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions and cytoskeleton organization that determine the timing, velocity and pattern of ncc migration. integrins are cell surface receptors required for cell adhesion, migration, proliferation and differentiation  <cit> . integrins are recruited into focal adhesion complexes where they signal through interactions with focal adhesion proteins including focal adhesion kinase , integrin-linked kinase , pinch , parvin and paxillin  <cit> . interactions of focal adhesion proteins with integrins are important for focal adhesion formation and maturation, modulation of integrin-ligand binding affinity and ecm remodeling  <cit> . deletion of focal adhesion protein pinch <dig> or fak in nccs results in defective tgfβ signaling and impaired smc differentiation of mutant cardiac nccs. however, migration of fak or pinch <dig> mutant cardiac nccs into the oft is normal  <cit> . interestingly, pinch <dig> mutant embryos presented a hyperplastic common arterial trunk that is distinct from that seen in fak mutants, suggesting distinct roles in ncc and oft morphogenesis.

ilk, a key component of focal adhesion complex, binds to the cytoplasmic domain of β <dig> and β <dig> integrins and several key actin binding proteins and adaptors  <cit> . ilk has been shown to act as a serine/threonine kinase to directly phosphorylate and activate downstream signaling molecules including akt and glycogen synthase kinase 3β   <cit> . however, a recent in vivo study has shown that the kinase activity of ilk is dispensable; instead, the pseudokinase domain of ilk acts as a protein interaction domain essential for recruitment of several adaptors and signaling molecules, including parvins  <cit> . genetic studies have revealed an essential role for ilk during embryogenesis  <cit> . deletion of ilk in mice leads to peri-implantation lethality, which resembles that of integrin β <dig> or pinch <dig> knockouts  <cit> . genetic studies in different contexts have revealed distinct requirements for ilk in ecm deposition/assembly, migration, proliferation and survival  <cit> . due to early embryonic lethality of ilk null mice, the role of ilk in ncc and oft development is unknown.

in this study, we ablated ilk specifically in ncc using the wnt1-cre transgene. deletion of ilk in ncc resulted in abnormal ncc migration to the pharyngeal arches and the oft and impaired smooth muscle differentiation. ilk mutant embryos present an enlarged common arterial trunk similar to that of pinch <dig> mutants, but strikingly different from that of other mutants reported previously, suggesting a unique role of ilk-pinch <dig> in cardiac ncc and a previously unappreciated role for cardiac ncc in oft formation.

RESULTS
generation of mice with ilk deletion specifically in the neural crest cells
we analyzed expression of ilk in the oft during development. rna in situ hybridization  with a probe to ilk revealed ubiquitous expression of ilk in mouse embryos at e <dig>  and e <dig>  . immunostaining with ilk antibody and β-galactosidase  staining of adjacent sections from wnt1-cre; rosa-lacz embryos at e <dig>  showed that ilk was expressed in the oft, including the oft mesenchyme that was colocalized with wnt1-cre lineage  . furthermore, immunostaining of cultured nccs with antibodies to ilk and sox <dig>  a neural crest marker, revealed expression of ilk in the cytoplasm and focal adhesions of nccs .

to investigate the role of ilk in ncc and oft morphogenesis, we ablated ilk specifically in nccs using wnt1-cre. floxed ilk   <cit>  mice were crossed with wnt1-cre mice. resulting ilk heterozygous mice  were viable, fertile and did not present any phenotypes, and thus were used as a littermate control in this study. wnt1-cre;ilkf/+ mice were backcrossed with ilkf/f mice to generate ncc-specific ilk mutant mice . ablation of ilk expression in neural crest derivatives of the oft was confirmed by ilk immunostaining .

deletion of ilk in nccs resulted in embryonic lethality and oft malformation
to visualize the morphology of the oft and pharyngeal arch arteries, we did ish analysis of nko and control littermates at e <dig>  with a probe to connexin  <dig>  that is expressed in vascular endothelial cells, thus outlining the blood vessels  <cit> . at e <dig> , the pharyngeal arteries of nko mutant embryos displayed a pattern similar to that of control littermates . however, a notable dilation of nko mutant oft was observed at this early stage . from e <dig>  onwards, nko mutant embryos exhibited progressive oft dilation, hypoplastic thymus and frequent cranial hemorrhage . all nko mutant embryos died around e <dig> . at e <dig>  control littermates exhibited well-defined aorta and pulmonary arteries, but nko mutant oft embryos displayed an enlarged common trunk that was stiff and difficult to separate from surrounding tissues ). histological analysis of control  and nko mutant  embryos at e <dig>  and e <dig> revealed that nko mutant ofts were markedly dilated and protruded in between the tongue and pharynx, pushing the tongue ventrally, and the pharynx of nko mutants became deformed at e <dig> . furthermore, we observed ventricular septal defect , a thinner ventricular myocardium compact zone  and shortened mandibles  in nko mutants at e <dig>  furthermore, mri and 3d reconstruction of control and nko mutant hearts at e <dig> revealed severe cardiovascular defects in nko mutant embryos, including vsd and right ventricular outflow tract  and a markedly dilated cat that appeared to be formed by inclusion of all segments of the oft and proximal parts of the pharyngeal arch arteries .

premature emigration and altered migration pattern of cardiac ncc in nko mutant embryos
wnt1-cre lineage analysis was performed to examine the migration and colonization of nko mutant cardiac nccs into the pharyngeal arches and oft. wnt1-cre; ilkf/+ mice were crossed with ilkf/f mice on a rosa-lacz  <cit>  or rosa-tdtomato  <cit>  reporter background that allows us to visualize nccs by β-gal staining and tdtomato red. at e <dig>  , a slightly increased number of β-gal+/tdtomato + cells were observed in the cranial mesenchyme and the forming first pharyngeal arch  of nko mutants . few, if any, control postotic nccs were found in the paraxial mesoderm underneath the neural plates . in contrast, a substantial number of postotic nccs of somite-matched nko mutant embryos at e <dig>   were found to migrate to the paraxial mesenchyme , suggesting ablation of ilk resulted in premature ncc emigration. control cardiac nccs at e <dig>  migrated as distinct streams en route to pharyngeal arch  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and the oft, a few of which migrated into the aortic sac . in contrast, a significant increase in the number of nko mutant nccs at e <dig>  was observed in cranial regions and the first and second pharyngeal arches . migration of postotic nccs of nko mutants appeared to be diffuse and the caudal stream seemed slightly wider in the nko mice . histological analysis revealed an increased number of nccs accumulated in the pharyngeal arches and aortic sac in nko mutant embryos at e <dig>  and some nccs had prematurely migrated into the oft . at e <dig> , cardiac nccs of control embryos started to migrate into the oft up to the conotruncal junction and colonized the subendocardial mesenchyme of the outflow cushion . in somite-matched nko mutants, the oft and the third pharyngeal arch were significantly enlarged and a marked increase in the number of nccs was found in the pharyngeal mesoderm. within the oft, nko mutant nccs migrated beyond the conotruncal junction and invaded entire layers of the oft . at e <dig>  histological analysis of the aortic arch and proximal oft revealed that the oft of control littermates were separated into aorta and pulmonary arteries, and control nccs contributed to a subpopulation of mesenchymal cells  of aortic arch, aorta, pulmonary artery and oft cushion . however, the oft of nko mutants at e <dig> exhibited an enlarged common trunk with a significantly increased number of nccs  .

an increased number of nccs in the pharyngeal arches and oft of nko mutant embryos may be due to increased ncc proliferation and reduced cell death. we examined ncc proliferation by phosphohistone h <dig>  antibody staining at e <dig>  , e <dig>  and e <dig> . mitotic indices were determined by counting the number of cells per section that were doubly positive for tdtomato red  and ph <dig> staining, normalized to the total number of nccs and derivatives  within the pharyngeal arteries and ofts of nko mutant and control embryos . we did not observe significant change in proliferation in the pharyngeal and oft regions of nko and control littermates. we also performed terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dutp nick-end labeling  staining to measure neural crest cell death and no significant change in cell death in the pharyngeal and oft regions of nko and control littermates was observed at different developmental stages .

we further examined the rate and pattern of ncc migration in neural crest explant culture from e <dig>  nko mutant and control embryos. nko mutant nccs on fibronectin coated plates were able to migrate out of neural tube explants. however, after  <dig> h, most nko mutant nccs rounded up and detached, suggesting defective adhesion. we cultured neural crest explants embedded in mitrogel. after  <dig> h, some control nccs  started to migrate out as distinct streams . however, nko mutant nccs migrated earlier  and lost their stream-like migration pattern as individual cells . quantitative analysis of ncc migration  <cit>  revealed that nko mutant nccs migrated significantly longer distances and to a bigger outgrowth area  compared to control nccs.

reduced focal adhesion and akt phosphorylation, and impaired cytoskeleton organization in nko mutant nccs
to examine the formation of focal adhesion complexes of mutant nccs in culture, we examined expression of paxillin and parvin, two key components of the focal adhesion complex. in control nccs, expression of paxillin and parvin displayed a well organized pattern associated with focal adhesions . in nko mutant nccs, expression of paxillin in focal adhesions appeared to be diffuse. however, expression of parvin and pinch <dig> were relatively normal revealed by immunostaining and western blot .

nccs express multiple integrin subtypes with differential binding affinity to distinct ecm ligands. to test whether deletion of ilk selectively affected the adhesive function mediated by particular integrins, we assayed adhesion of nko mutant and control nccs to different integrin ligands. because of difficulty of isolating enough nccs from nko mutant embryos, we established an ilkf/f ncc culture and ablated ilk expression in vitro by infection of cre recombinase adenoviruses  <cit> . for this experiment, ilkf/f nccs were infected with cre or control adenoviruses, and cultured for additional  <dig> h and then used to examine adhesion and spreading of ilk mutant  and control nccs  on different substrates. ilk mutant nccs on all substrates tested exhibited progressive cell shrinkage  and detachment during the course of culture. adhesions of ilk mutant nccs to fibronectin, laminin, collagen and vitronectin were markedly reduced  suggesting that in nccs, ilk is required for adhesion to multiple classes of integrins.

activation of integrins leads to akt phosphorylation and cytoskeleton reorganization required for cell growth, survival and migration. coimmunostaining with antibodies to β-gal and phosphorylated akt revealed a significant reduction in akt phosphorylation in nko mutant nccs compared to the control . in culture, control nccs were polarized with well-aligned actin filaments. however, in ilk mutant nccs 48-h post-viral infection, there was a large accumulation of cortical actin in the cell cortex and a significant increase in short, randomized filapodia-like protrusions .

reduced ecm deposition and cell-cell adhesion in nko mutant embryos
we examined whether impaired integrin-ilk signaling resulted in changes in ecm expression in nko mutant ofts by immunostaining. we observed significantly reduced expression of laminin and fibronectin in nko mutant oft at e <dig>  relative to control . at e <dig>  elastin, a key component of the elastic matrix of the great vessels, was expressed in the aortic arch of control embryos. however, elastin expression in nko mutant oft was significantly reduced . in addition, microarray analysis of rnas from nko mutant and control nccs revealed significantly reduced expression of several ecm components , selected targets were confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction  studies, including lamb <dig>  col9a <dig>  col8a <dig> and fndc <dig> .

we further investigated whether deletion of ilk resulted in defective cell-cell adhesions by examining the expression of ncam that is required for ncc migration  <cit> . in culture, control nccs were elongated and established proper cell-cell contacts and alignment. clusters of ncam were found at the cell-cell contacts of control nccs . however, ilk mutant  nccs in culture tended to be separated with markedly reduced ncam expression . consistent with this, we observed a significant reduction in ncam expression in the dorsal neural tube of nko mutant embryos at e <dig>  .

reduced tgfβ signaling and smooth muscle differentiation in nko mutant oft
differentiation of cardiac nccs to oft smooth muscle was assessed by immunostaining with an antibody to α-smooth muscle actin  and ncc lineage marker . in contrast to control oft with well-formed smooth muscle layers , α-sma expression in e <dig>  nko mutant oft that were derived from nccs  was greatly reduced , although smooth muscle differentiation from non-nccs  appeared to be relatively normal . it has been reported that tgfβ <dig> signaling can affect oft development  <cit> , we examined tgfβ <dig> expression and its downstream mediator smad <dig> activation at e <dig>  in ilk mutants. wholemount ish revealed markedly reduced tgfβ <dig> expression in nko mutant oft relative to control . in addition, western blot using ilkf/f;cre+ mutant and control nccs revealed significantly reduced tgfβ <dig> expression and smad <dig> phosphorylation, although the total smad <dig> level was not changed .

microarray analysis of the oft of nko mutants and control littermates
to gain insight into genetic programs required for ncc and oft development, we performed microarray analysis of cardiac nccs that were fluorescence-activated cell sorting -sorted from the oft of nko mutant and control littermate embryos at e <dig>  . microarray data were submitted to the gene expression omnibus database under geo accession numbers gse <dig>  consistent with the observed phenotypes, our data revealed significant changes  in the expression of genes associated with migration/cytoskeleton/ecm, muscle/heart development, neurogenesis and osteogenesis .

among genes implicated in migration/cytoskeleton/ecm, we found increased expression of plek, fermt <dig> and ly <dig>  but decreased expression of col9a <dig>  lamb1- <dig>  st3gal <dig> and limk <dig>  we found a significant reduction in the expression of genes of muscle differentiation including myog, scx, zfp <dig>  xist, neb and nppa, suggesting reduced myocardialization of nko mutant oft. sall <dig>  a zinc finger transcription factor associated with heart and oft development, was upregulated in nko mutant  <cit> . gp1bb, a gene located within the digeorge syndrome critical region, was upregulated in nko mutants. components of a number of signaling pathways involved in cardiovascular development were upregulated, among which, sost and wfikkn <dig> have been reported to be mediators of tgfβ, bmp and wnt signaling, and fabp <dig> is a direct target of notch signaling in glial cells. lbxcor <dig>  downregulated in nko mutants, is a smad binding protein and negatively regulates bmp signaling. selected targets were verified by qpcr .

development of the parathyroid from the third pharyngeal pouch is initiated via inductive signals that involve nccs. parathyroid hypoplasia is a primary feature of digeorge syndrome. we found parathyroid hormone  expression was greatly reduced in nko mutants .

ectopic ossification and neurogenesis in nko mutant oft
nccs have the potential to differentiate into multiple cell types, including osteoblasts and neurons of the peripheral nervous system. interestingly, in nko mutant oft, we found significantly increased expression of genes associated with neural differentiation, including a number of neuronal cytoskeleton and associated proteins  and neural signaling factors  . neurofilament immunostaining  and β-gal staining  of adjacent sections of control embryos at e <dig>  revealed the formation of the superior cervical ganglia  and cardiac ganglia  around aorta and pulmonary arteries. however, in nko mutant embryos at e <dig> , we observed ectopic innervation or ganglia in the distal wall of the cat and within the proximal wall of the oft .

in addition, a number of genes associated with osteogenesis exhibited altered expression patterns, for example, expression of spp <dig> was upregulated, whereas aspn and lect <dig>  negative regulators of osteoblast differentiation, were downregulated, suggesting increased ossification . consistent with this, we found, by alcian blue  staining, ectopic ossification in nko mutant oft at e <dig>  . in addition, ish and qpcr revealed marked upregulation of col1a <dig>  a marker of osteoblast differentiation  <cit> , in nko mutant oft at e <dig>  . bmp <dig> signaling has been implicated in osteoblast differentiation  <cit> . we observed significantly increased phosphorylation of smad <dig> and expression of bmp2k  in the oft of nko mutant embryos at e <dig>  .

discussion
our study has revealed essential roles for ilk in ncc migration and smc differentiation within the oft. nko mutant embryos exhibited a distinctive enlarged common trunk  which is similar to that observed in ncc specific pinch <dig> mutants. reduced adhesion of ilk mutant ncc, reduced expression of ncam and ecm genes, and altered tgfβ <dig> and bmp signaling in nko mutant oft may collectively contribute to the unique ncc and oft phenotypes of nko mutants. microarray analysis of facs sorted nccs revealed decreased expression of genes associated with muscle differentiation, but increased expression of genes associated with osteogenesis and neurogenesis, suggesting a central role of ilk in integration of complex genetic programs required for ncc and oft morphogenesis.

ncc delamination and migration to their respective final targets are timely and coordinated processes regulated by cell-cell, cell-ecm interactions and cytoskeleton organization. ablation of ilk resulted in precocious post otic ncc emigration at e <dig>  , when few, if any, control postotic nccs had started to emigrate. at e <dig> , cranial nccs  of control embryos migrated as distinct streams to the pharyngeal arches and circumpharyngeal region. however, a markedly increased number of nccs were found in the pharyngeal arches and the aortic sac, some of which had prematurely migrated deep into the truncal oft. at e <dig> , a marked increase in ncc numbers was found in mutant pharyngeal arches. within the oft, control nccs at e <dig>  migrated as two distinct columns within the subendocardial cushion up to the conotruncal junction  <cit> . in contrast, nccs in the oft of nko mutants were significantly increased, and migrated deeper into the conal region. however, no changes in neural crest cell proliferation and cell death were observed in nko mutant ofts compared to control littermates. these observations suggest that deletion of ilk leads to increased ncc motility and the loss of a distinct distribution pattern of nccs within the oft. consistent with this, in neural tube explant cultures, outgrowth of control nccs started  <dig> h after incubation as distinct streams. however, migration of nko mutant nccs started earlier and they lost their stream-like pattern. nko mutant nccs in culture migrated faster and to a bigger outgrowth area, and tended to migrate as individual cells with less cell-cell contacts and directionality. furthermore, control nccs were polarized with well-aligned actin filaments, whereas nko mutant nccs exhibited markedly disorganized actin filaments with increased cortical actin protrusions, suggestive of increased motility  <cit> . in addition, nko mutant nccs in culture exhibited a significant reduction in integrin activation, focal adhesion complex formation and akt activation. furthermore, in dorsal neural tube and cultured nccs, we observed markedly reduced expression of ncam required for the emigration and early migration of nccs  <cit> . these observations revealed a critical requirement for ilk in modulating the timing, velocity and pattern of ncc migration.

numerous molecules, including growth factors, ecm and adhesion molecules play essential roles in pharyngeal arch artery and oft morphogenesis. loss of individual genes commonly causes certain parts of pharyngeal arteries to abnormally persist or regress, leading to a spectrum of oft anomalies. however, most mutant mice exhibit no defects in cardiac ncc delamination and migration. for example, nccs deficient in bmp, pdgf and tgfβ signaling, fibronectin, α5-integrin, pinch <dig>  fak and n-cadherin populate the pharyngeal arches and oft properly, although subsequent ncc proliferation, survival and differentiation within the oft are variably impaired, affecting subsets of nccs  <cit> . however, in nko mutants, we observed marked changes in the timing and pattern of ncc migration without significant changes in proliferation and cell death, suggesting a distinct role for ilk in ncc and oft morphogenesis.

nccs have the potential to differentiate into multiple cell types, including cartilage, vascular smc and peripheral neurons, which involves multiple signaling pathways, including tgfβ <dig> and bmp signaling  <cit> . nko mutant mice exhibited an enlarged common arterial trunk that appeared to be formed by fusion of aortic arches and proximal parts of pharyngeal arteries. impaired smc differentiation was observed that affected all segments of nko mutant oft. therefore, in contrast to previous studies in which defective smc differentiation affects only subsets of nccs and their contributing pharyngeal arch arteries or aortic arches  <cit> , the failure of smc differentiation in nko mutant oft is pervasive. reduced tgfβ <dig> signaling but increased bmp <dig> signaling was observed in nko mutant ofts that may account in part for the observed oft phenotype. loss of tgfβ <dig> signaling has been shown to lead to ectopic great vessel innervation and ganglion formation within the oft  <cit> , whereas bmp <dig> signaling is required for osteoblastic differentiation  <cit> . consistent with this, we observed ectopic ossification and neurogenesis in nko mutant oft. furthermore, our microarray analysis of facs purified nccs revealed significantly increased expression of genes involved in neurogenesis  and osteogenesis , suggesting a role for ilk in cardiac ncc differentiation and fate determination.

a number of genes associated with muscle differentiation  were downregulated in nko mutant oft, suggesting impaired myocardialization of nko mutant oft. sall <dig> is a zinc finger transcription factor upregulated in nko mutants, and mutation of sall <dig> causes ventricular septal defects  <cit> . digeorge syndrome is a common congenital disorder caused by chromosome 22q <dig> deletion resulting in defective neural crest migration. a region containing four genes  has been identified responsible for cardiac outflow tract defects and lethality. although tbx <dig> is the major candidate gene for digeorge syndrome, other genes are likely to function as modifiers  <cit> . gp1bb is a gene located within the digeorge syndrome critical region. deletion or reduced expression of gp1bb is associated with a human bleeding disorder, bernard-soulier syndrome  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our study has revealed an essential role for ilk in integrating signaling pathways and the crosstalk between ecm and cytoskeleton required for ncc and oft morphogenesis. defects in these interactions results in abnormal ncc migration and differentiation that contribute to the unique nko mutant oft phenotype. future studies are needed to further elucidate how ilk and pinch <dig> may cooperate or interact with each other to regulate neural crest migration and differentiation, whether these defects are related or two separate processes, and how each process contributes to observed phenotypes. it also remains to be determined whether ilk switches nccs from a cardiac fate to a cranial fate to form cranial-specific cartilage cells.
