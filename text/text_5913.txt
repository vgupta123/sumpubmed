BACKGROUND
the use of mouse models has provided valuable insight into the etiology of monogenic syndromes caused by single gene mutations. however, such models do not mimic the genetic complexity of disease traits commonly seen in the human population. complex traits, such as polygenic growth and obesity are influenced by the small to moderate direct effects of quantitative trait loci , epistasis between qtl alleles, environmental perturbations and qtl-environment interactions.

to date numerous mouse growth and obesity qtl have been localized  <cit> , however, little progress has been made in determining the specific nature of the underlying genetic variants. one resource used to fine map qtl are congenic strains which are designed to convert a complex polygenic trait into one that is mono- or oligogenic. this is accomplished by eliminating segregating genetic variation outside the locus of interest and reducing the environmental variation influencing a trait by characterizing large numbers of genetically identical mice. the complex trait consortium  considers congenic analysis an excellent method to confirm and subsequently fine map qtl  <cit> .

traditionally, congenic strains are developed by introgressing qtl alleles from a donor strain, whose boundaries are defined by genetic markers, on the genetic background of a recipient strain via  <dig> backcrosses  <cit> . while technically straightforward this is a time consuming endeavor taking over three years to construct a single strain. the speed congenic approach is an alternative to this lengthy process and can reduce the number of required backcrosses from  <dig> to five  <cit> . this strategy uses marker-assisted selection to identify male mice inheriting fewer donor alleles, than expected on average, during each backcross. numerous traditionally developed and speed congenics have been used to successfully isolate mouse qtl for a wide array of traits, including growth and obesity  <cit> .

the c57bl/6j-hg/hg  mouse is a model of systemic overgrowth resulting from a spontaneous deletion on mmu <dig>  which eliminates expression of the socs <dig>  gene  <cit> . the role of socs <dig> in the hg phenotype was confirmed by an independently engineered socs2-/- knockout mouse which shared a number of phenotypes in common with hg, including gigantism  <cit> .

qtl which alter the phenotypic effects of another locus are referred to as modifier qtl  <cit> . modifier qtl have been mapped for numerous traits and in these studies the modified locus is typically a known gene containing a spontaneously arisen or engineered mutation with major phenotypic effects, such as hg  <cit> . epistasis forms the basis of these interactions, implying that the known gene and its modifiers are members of the same biochemical or metabolic pathway. different genetic backgrounds have been shown to modify the growth-enhancing effects of hg  <cit> . since the primary function of socs <dig> is to negatively regulate growth hormone   <cit> , it is likely these background effects are the result of polymorphism influencing interactions between members of the gh signaling pathway. thus, identification of hg modifiers has the potential to uncover novel members of metabolically important pathways or previously unknown convergences between pathways.

as an initial step, growth and carcass composition qtl were identified in a cross between cast/eij  and hg  <cit> . in the f <dig>  mice homozygous for the hg deletion  and wild type  were assayed and hg modifier qtl were defined as those either absent in +/+ mice and segregating in hg/hg or loci with altered gene action dependent on background. four hg modifier qtl  were identified, along with  <dig> additional qtl , wg <dig>  carp <dig>  cara <dig> and feml <dig> on mmu <dig>  carfhg <dig> on mmu <dig>  wg <dig> on mmu <dig>  feml <dig> on mmu <dig>  wg <dig> and cara <dig> on mmu <dig> and carp <dig> and cara <dig> on mmu17) whose expression was independent of the hg locus.

in the current study we have developed speed congenic strains to isolate all the aforementioned qtl. single strains on an hg background were created for each chromosomal region outside of mmu <dig>  while a comprehensive panel of overlapping strains with identical donor regions on both b <dig> and hg backgrounds were developed for mmu <dig>  the mmu <dig> panel was developed to confirm the presence of multiple qtl and test for qtl-hg interactions. additionally, based on the knowledge of potential qtl-hg interactions, genes involved in gh signaling, whose genomic location overlapped hg modifier qtl on mmu <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  were sequenced.

RESULTS
speed congenic strain development
two speed congenic panels were created, the first comprehensively dissected mmu <dig> while the second isolated qtl on mmu <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . the mmu <dig> panel consisted of eight congenic strains developed by introgressing four overlapping donor regions onto both b <dig> and hg genetic backgrounds . single donor regions bred onto an hg background were created to isolate the remaining qtl on mmu <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  implementation of a speed congenic approach using marker-assisted breeding with  <dig> genome-wide microsatellite markers accelerated production of all strains  <cit>  . strain abbreviations and genomic region isolated by each strain are listed in table  <dig>  in addition to both congenic panels, two control strains homozygous b <dig>  or hg  for all genome-wide markers genotyped were developed from the same cross  and served as the basis for strain comparisons. after stabilizing each congenic,  <dig> of  <dig> were phenotypically characterized for growth and adiposity. the hg2d and hg <dig> strains were not characterized due to reproductive problems. the recombinant end points for all strains were refined using microsatellite markers flanking each donor region .

mmu <dig> speed congenic strain characterization
due to the overlapping nature of the mmu <dig> congenics, five distinct chromosomal regions  were queried for the presence of qtl . as a separate analysis we also tested for interactions between each donor region and the two distinct genetic backgrounds. the following sections describe the phenotypes for each b <dig> cast and hg.cast speed congenic strain as well as the results of the interaction analysis.

b <dig> cast mmu <dig> speed congenic strains
the b62d strain exhibited the largest  decreases in body weight of any b <dig> cast congenic . both sexes had reductions in weight at  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  weeks of age compared to control b6c mice . despite large decreases in body weight, no differences in growth rates  were observed . therefore, the b62d unique region  harbors either an early-growth qtl or maternal genotype effect which produces a distinct decrease in body weight prior to 2wk. these effects are evident in the growth curves for both sexes of each strain . additionally, b62d mice displayed significantly shorter tail lengths despite no difference in naso-anal length  .

in contrast, b62m mice displayed small decreases in body weights and growth  and significant decreases in na  and tail length . the decrease in na in b62m mice is surprising since the 2m donor region is entirely nested within the 2d donor region and b62d mice showed no difference in na . these data indicate the presence of three qtl with the 2d unique region. two of which are disjoined by the b62m and b62d strains and additively decrease body weight and tail length, but not na. the third qtl, located within the b62d unique region , increases na canceling the effects of the b62m qtl  decreasing na.

b62pm females had decreases in all growth-related traits except 2wk and 3wk, while no differences were seen in males . similarly, only b62p females and not males showed significant decreases in 9wk, g <dig> and g <dig> , indicating these two strains share a female specific growth qtl .

in the original genome scan body fat percentage as determined by chemical compositional analysis was not linked to markers on mmu <dig>  <cit> . however, since numerous obesity qtl have been found on mmu <dig>  <cit> , some of which were discovered in b <dig> by cast crosses  <cit> , we chose to measure dissected fat pad weights as a more sensitive measure of adiposity.

hg.cast mmu <dig> speed congenic panel
hg2p and hg2pm mice of both sexes displayed significant decreases in post-weaning body weights and growth rates . in addition, the hg2m strain displayed highly significant decreases in length, similar to b62m mice . these results indicate qtl within region ii shared between the hg2p and hg2pm strains decrease body size, weight gain and na , while a qtl in the hg2m region significantly decreases tail length.

similar to growth traits a general decrease in gfp, mfp, rfp, tf and ai were seen in hg2p and hg2pm mice  . these differences in adiposity are likely pleiotropic effects of the growth qtl shared between these two strains. surprisingly, hg2m mice displayed striking sex differences in adiposity. males exhibited an increase in ai  with a decrease in bmi  and the exact opposite was seen in females  . therefore, the obesity qtl in the hg2m unique region  is profoundly impacted by the presence of hg.

confirmation of qtl-hg interactions
an important feature of our experimental design was the ability to test for interactions between qtl in each mmu <dig> donor region and genotype at the hg locus, since identical donor regions were introgressed on two genetic backgrounds, b <dig>  and hg . significant interactions between donor region and hg genotype were viewed as strong evidence that hg modifier qtl reside within that unique genomic region.

in the original linkage analysis the mode of gene action and peak location of wg <dig> were dependent on the presence of hg  <cit>  . in the present study, only homozygous congenic mice were characterized, thus, the overdominant effects of wg <dig> were not tested. however, since its original peak location differed dependent on background we hypothesized that wg <dig> represents a set of linked qtl between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mbp within the 2m and 2d donor regions , some of which interact with hg. following this logic we expected one or both of these strains would exhibit donor region by hg genotype interactions. unfortunately, we were unable to characterize hg2d mice. however, as noted above, strong sex-specific effects were seen in hg2m mice. significant 2m donor region by hg genotype by sex three-way interactions for ai  and tf were identified . the basis of these interactions was a decrease in hg2m female and an increase in hg2m male adiposity, with no differences in fat accumulation across b62m sexes. significant 2pm donor region by hg genotype two-way and 2pm donor region by hg genotype by sex three-way interactions were also seen for tf and ai . in addition, significant 2p donor region × hg genotype interactions were observed for all traits listed, although some traits did reached significance at the critical p <  <dig>  . the basis for each interaction was a decrease in phenotype in hg2p compared to hgc and no difference between b62p and b6c. together these data confirm that mmu <dig> qtl modify the effects of the hg deletion.

speed congenic strains for qtl on mmu <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 17
hg1
q1ucd <dig> affecting g <dig> was the least significant of any qtl identified in the original intercross and only reached a suggestive level of significance   <cit> . in accordance, hg <dig> mice had small differences in all growth and length traits. na in both sexes and 2wk, 3wk, 6wk and tail length in females was significant at a critical p <  <dig>  . the only difference in adiposity was a significant decrease in male mfp . the successful capture and confirmation of the small effect q1ucd1-w <dig> qtl adds support to pursuing qtl identified at suggestive levels of statistical confidence from genome scans.

hg8
markers on mmu <dig> were linked with g <dig> in the original intercross  <cit> . this qtl was small, only accounting for  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance. interestingly, in hg <dig> mice no differences in growth were detected; however, they were significantly leaner than controls . in males a general decrease in fat pad mass, tf and ai was detected; however, only mfp was significant at a critical p <  <dig> . male ai was nearly significant at a nominal p =  <dig> . larger decreases in fat mass were seen in hg <dig> females, with significant decreases detected for gfp, mfp and ai. additionally, rfp and tf were nearly significant with nominal p values of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. hg <dig> mice represent a lean congenic model in which cast alleles protect against fat accumulation.

hg9
cast alleles in the proximal region of mmu <dig> were previously found to be linked with an increase in body fat percentage and a decrease in femur length  <cit> . the effects appeared to be the result of two linked qtl, carfhg <dig> at  <dig> cm and feml <dig> at  <dig> cm, instead of one pleiotropically impacting both traits . in support of this, the increase in fat was dependent on hg; however, differences in femur length were not  <cit> .

in confirmation of carfhg <dig> all measures of adiposity in hg <dig> mice were increased relative to control mice; except mfp in both sexes and bmi in males . in males, gfp, rfp, ffp and ai were increased by  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. in females these increases were much larger. the same measurements were increased by  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, relative to hgc females. a  <dig> % and  <dig> % reduction in male and female na, respectively, was also detected. this was expected since na was previously found to be an excellent indicator of femur length  in hg mice  <cit>  and as noted above this region contains the feml <dig> qtl  <cit> . these data confirm the effects of carfhg <dig> on adiposity and feml <dig> on length and indicate the isolated effects of carfhg <dig> are more significant than originally observed.

hg11
in the original intercross cast alleles near  <dig> cm on mmu <dig> were linked with a reduction in g <dig>  carcass ash  and carcass protein   <cit> . therefore, we measured each carcass component using chemical compositional analysis in the hgc, hg <dig> and hg <dig> strains. originally, carp <dig> was dependent on the presence of hg and no significant sex effects were detected  <cit> . in contrast to those results, hg <dig> mice displayed significant differences in growth and obesity between the sexes. in general, males demonstrated a 5% increase and females a 5% decrease in all growth-related traits . most of these differences, however, were not significant at a critical p <  <dig> , although almost all were at a nominal p <  <dig> . following the same trend, males displayed an increase in tail length and a small suggestive increase in na , while females displayed significant decreases in na. in support of the sex-specific qtl effects strain by sex interactions  were seen for the following growth traits: 3wk, 6wk, 9wk, g <dig>  g <dig> and na . the basis of each interaction was an increase in the males and a decrease in females.

in our analysis of the hgc, hg <dig> and hg <dig> strains, concordant results were observed measuring adiposity using chemical lipid extraction and weighing fat pad mass. the phenotypic correlation between carcass fat  as a percent of the empty carcass weight  minus the head and gastrointestinal tract)  determined by chemical analysis and ai, using data from all three lines , was  <dig> . these data suggest that individual fat pad dissection is an excellent proxy for measuring whole body adiposity and provides a much more sensitive technique to measure fat accumulation in specific body regions.

hg <dig> females displayed slight increases in all fat pads  and ai, although, only the  <dig> % increase in ai was significant . in contrast, hg <dig> males did not show a difference in fat mass leading to a significant strain by sex interaction  for ai . identical to the results obtained using fat pad weights; female hg <dig> carcasses displayed an increase in %fat .

hg <dig> male carcasses had higher levels carcass ash  as a percent of ecw  and female carcasses displayed lower levels of h2o and ash . strains by sex interactions  were identified for h2o, %h2o, %fat, ash and prot . if the aggregate phenotype in hg <dig> is due to a single locus, its function may be to disrupt energy partitioning by decreasing the deposition of lean tissue and increasing lipid accumulation in females, while having the opposite action in males. however, it may also be due to distinct sex-specific qtl with opposing action.

hg17
in the original intercross cast alleles at mmu <dig> markers were associated with decreases in femur length, ash and prot  <cit>  and similar results were seen in hg <dig> mice. interestingly, both sexes were heavier at 2wk , but lighter at 9wk, leading to substantially lower g <dig> and g <dig> . in general growth differences ranged between 5% and 15% lower in congenic mice.

both sexes had significant reductions in length traits relative to control mice. na was reduced by  <dig> %  and  <dig> % in males and females, respectively . in addition, tail was reduced by approximately 6% in both sexes .

in general, hg <dig> mice displayed increases in all fat pads , tf and ai . however, none of these differences were significant at critical p <  <dig> . in addition, hg <dig> male carcasses possessed lower levels of h2o and ash, while female carcasses contained lower levels of % h2o, ash, %ash and %prot .

mmu <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hg modifier candidate gene sequencing
the hg phenotype is due to the deletion of socs <dig>  therefore we reasoned that qtl on mmu <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> interacting with hg possibly represent variation within genes participating in various aspects of gh function. to select candidate genes for sequencing we identified genes known to be or potentially involved in gh signaling, are responsive to gh or that propagate downstream gh functions. forty-four hg modifier candidate genes were identified from primary literature, reviews and book chapters and coordinated using the genmapp  pathway building software . the coding region of each gene was sequenced from the cast strain and compared to the publicly available b <dig> sequence to identify polymorphisms . a total of  <dig>  kbp was sequenced ), representing  <dig>  amino acids. comparison with the public b <dig> assembly  mm <dig> genome assembly, national center for biotechnology information  build 33) identified  <dig> polymorphisms between cast and b <dig>  of these,  <dig> were single nucleotide polymorphisms  and  <dig> were insertions or deletions in cast . all  <dig> insertions or deletions were located within 5' and 3' utrs. fifty-six nonsynonomous snp  were identified in  <dig> different genes . polyphen  <cit>  and sift  <cit>  are software programs designed to identify nssnp which potentially alter protein function by evaluating evolutionary conservation at specific amino acid residues using a multiple sequence alignment of protein sequences homologous to the query. when applied to our data set polyphen, sift or both programs predicted that  <dig> of the  <dig> nssnp in  <dig> different genes would possibly alter protein function .

discussion
speed congenic strains provide a powerful approach to confirm and physically confine qtl within intervals defined by molecular markers. in the current study, approximately 20% of the cast genome harboring all previously detected growth and carcass composition qtl was isolated on an hg or b <dig> background through the development of  <dig> speed congenic strains. two distinct speed congenic panels were developed, the first provided a comprehensive isolation of all mmu <dig> qtl between the b <dig>  hg and cast strains and the second targeted all qtl outside of mmu <dig>  each successfully characterized strain exhibited phenotypic differences relative to control mice. these strains represent important resources and provide the genetic resource to positionally clone numerous quantitative trait genes.

one criticism of the speed congenic approach is the potential for qtl to reside among unwanted donor alleles not eliminated during backcrossing. in this case differences between the congenic and control strains would be due in part or whole to these contaminating alleles. we took several precautions to reduce the probability of this occurrence. first, our control strains were developed from mice undergoing the same selection as all of the other congenics. therefore, it is possible that any unwanted qtl or mutations arising during congenic construction are shared between all strains. more importantly, we have knowledge of all large previously detected growth and obesity qtl in the current cross  <cit> . using this information we increased the density of markers in each qtl region , ensuring the absence of cast alleles at each of these qtl. this approach, termed "qtl-marker-assisted counter selection" or qmacs, has been previously used to characterize qtl for hypnotic sensitivity to ethanol  <cit> . in that study, only markers flanking qtl were typed, not genome-wide markers. in contrast, we selected not only against known qtl, we also screened for genome wide heterozygosity increasing the probability that effects observed are due to genetic variation within each donor region.

although great effort was put forth to eliminate non-donor region direct genetic effects, other factors such as maternal genotype  and environmental effects could confound our results. maternal genotype effects on growth and obesity have been observed in a number of mouse crosses  <cit>  and their existence in the current cross cannot be discounted. however, our congenics provide the ideal foundation genomic resource to test for the influence of any of these possible effects. future fine mapping experiments can be designed to randomize the influences of any contaminating donor alleles and environmental differences, as well as test for maternal genotype effects.

mmu <dig> is a hotspot for growth and obesity qtl. over  <dig> qtl have been identified in various experiments  <cit> . several previously reported or novel mmu <dig> qtl have been isolated and characterized using congenic strains  <cit> . our findings are no different and indicate that mmu <dig> is highly complex with regards to genes affecting growth and obesity. the overlapping nature of our mmu <dig> strains allowed us to parse the chromosome into five regions  . the data support the presence of at least one qtl in each of the five regions . each of the five pleiotropically impact both growth and obesity, although to varying degrees.

in addition to the large number of mmu <dig> qtl, the presence of hg adds complexity by either eliciting interactions with the same qtl or by inducing the expression of novel qtl. the 2p unique region  contains an hg modifier with large effects on growth and smaller effects on obesity . in contrast, interactions between 2pm/2m qtl and hg primarily affect fat deposition . as illustrated in figure  <dig> the 2m donor region exhibits strong sex effects on the rate of lipid storage, dependent on background. in control mice, hgc females have a higher ai than males, while the opposite is seen in b6c mice. interestingly, the 2m hg modifier qtl abolished the hg induced sexual dimorphism in adiposity . although these results provide insight into the nature of hg modifier qtl, it should be noted, that the actual number and precise location of loci is still unclear.

in addition to mmu <dig>  three other congenics  captured hg modifier qtl. in classical terms, they are qtl which modify the expressivity of growth and obesity in hg mice  <cit> . these qtl are novel since they represent epistasis between hg and the modifier gene. qtl-hg epistasis implies that socs <dig> and the hg modifiers are in the same biological pathway. therefore, these qtl are likely due to polymorphism in genes interacting with gh, responsive to gh or which in some way modulate gh function. this information will significantly aid qtl cloning by providing another filter to screen candidates. cloning these qtl has major implications to improve our understanding of gh and its regulation of growth and adiposity and in the administration of human gh therapeutics.

hg <dig> mice displayed differences only in growth traits. originally, q1ucd <dig> had small effects and these results illustrate the power of congenic strain analysis to isolate small effect qtl, although it is likely this qtl represents the lower boundary of detection using only 20– <dig> congenic mice. the most notable candidate genes located within the hg <dig> interval are the signal transducer and activator of transcription  <dig>  and stat <dig> 

two of the congenics had major alterations in the deposition of adipose tissue, hg <dig> and hg <dig>  the hg <dig> donor region promotes leanness. congenic females displayed a reduction of over 25% in ai. in contrast, the hg <dig> strain is an obese mouse model. the strain is quite novel for two reasons. first, the effect size is large; ai was 57% higher in hg <dig> females and 30% higher in males. secondly, it is dependent on hg for its expression. the hg <dig> strain represents a major epistasis-based obese mouse model and promises to aid in the understanding of obesity and specifically the modulation of adipose tissue deposition by gh. studies are currently underway to identify the causative mutation and to characterize the effects of age and diet on obesity in this strain as well as testing for other physiological consequences such as alterations in food intake and insulin sensitivity.

the hg <dig> strain is of particular interest for a number of reasons. first, hg <dig> congenic mice demonstrated significant strain by sex interactions for a number of traits. males were generally larger, faster growing and longer and the converse was seen in females. the confounding effects of sex are likely the reason for the discrepancies between the congenic and genome scan results, where both sexes were analyzed together. secondly, carp <dig> was found to interact with hg and mmu <dig> is saturated with genes involved in the central gh intracellular signaling pathway, such as gh, stat5b and stat5a. thirdly, mmu <dig> growth qtl overlapping hg <dig> have been identified in a number of crosses using different mouse strains  <cit> . given the well documented sexually dimorphic nature of gh secretion and gh induced gene expression  <cit> , it is probable that the underlying mutation in the hg <dig> congenic may reside in a gene enhancing gh induced sex-specific effects. the structural gh gene itself and stat5b are excellent candidates. the potential role of gh would include polymorphism that alters protein function in the absence of socs <dig> or that causes transcriptional deregulation of gh. additionally, functional variation in stat5b may explain the sex-specific phenotypes in hg <dig> mice since it is the primary transcription factor responsible for gh induced sex-specific liver gene expression  <cit> . future studies aimed at identifying the hg <dig> qtg, will certainly include a thorough characterization of gh and stat5b sequence and expression patterns in congenic mice.

the hg modifier qtl located within the hg <dig> strain had large effects on growth, body length and carcass components. the most intriguing candidate gene located in the congenic is sstr <dig>  somatostatin is a potent inhibitor of gh and sstr <dig> is one of five receptors which mediate these effects  <cit> . ubiquitous and pancreatic beta cell specific knockout of sstr <dig> leads to alterations in insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis  <cit> .

we sequenced candidate hg modifier genes to complement the characterization of the speed congenics on mmu <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  a limited number of studies have identified variation within cast coding sequence; so sequencing candidates gave us the opportunity to estimate the snp frequency in coding sequence relative to b <dig>  this information will be vital to future fine mapping studies, which will include gene expression analysis. the high snp frequency  in cast genes may lead to a higher rate of false positives using dna microarrays or quantitative real-time pcr assays, most of which are based on b <dig> sequence. therefore, these sequence data can be used to guide the development of gene expression assays to confirm differential expression for candidates and suggests that genes identified by downstream experiments should also be sequenced.

more importantly, sequencing hg modifier candidates allowed us to identify nonsynonomous polymorphism, which may underlie qtl. sift and/or polyphen predicted alterations in protein function for  <dig> of the  <dig> total nssnp  in nine of the  <dig> total genes  . it has been shown that predicting function based on evolutionary conservation using programs such as sift and polyphen is very accurate  <cit> . four of the nine genes  are of particular interest. it has been suggested the socs <dig> may rely on ubiquitination dependent proteasomal degradation to inhibit gh signaling  <cit> . ubr <dig> and ubce7ip <dig> are both involved in protein ubiquitination and ubr <dig> knockout mice show an 20% decrease in body weight partly due to a reduction in adipose tissue  <cit> . ptpns <dig> knockout mice displayed a 10% reduction in body weight  <cit>  and mmp <dig> knockout mice show a reduction in size and drastically reduced bone length  <cit> . all of these genes are excellent functional and positional hg modifier candidate genes and this information can be incorporated into future fine mapping studies.

CONCLUSIONS
the speed congenic strains developed herein confirm previously identified genome-wide qtl affecting growth, obesity and carcass composition. our novel congenic development approach on mmu <dig> provided confirmation of qtl-hg interactions, which will significantly aid in future fine mapping experiments. the identification of the molecular mediators of qtl-hg epistasis as well as the qtg for the remaining congenics will provide essential information on the molecular genetic architecture of growth and obesity.
