BACKGROUND
ticks are notorious as vectors of a large variety of infectious disease agents such as those that cause lyme disease, rocky mountain spotted fever, human  anaplasmosis, babesiosis and many others. as obligate hematophagic parasites, tick-borne infectious agents are acquired during the blood-feeding process. the tick midgut is the first tissue that pathogens encounter where infection must be established before they can migrate into the internal body organs and tissues. the effects of digestive enzymes expressed in response to the nutritive elements, especially hemoglobin, and the products of their digestive activities have been shown to inhibit or kill some invading microbes  <cit> . however, whether such peptidic fragments would also kill pathogenic microbes is unknown. in addition, antimicrobial peptides defensin and lysozyme have been reported from the midgut of a soft tick  <cit>  and evidence of their expression  was found in the hard tick dermacentor variabilis. although few in number, these reports suggest that the tick midgut presents a hostile environment for invading microorganisms. nevertheless, many survive and succeed in colonising this tissue and penetrating the tick internal organs.

in blood-feeding insects, molecules expressed in the midgut of these disease-transmitting vectors are believed to play an important role in determining initial parasite infection and subsequent development. in tsetse flies, for example,  <dig> midgut proteins were upregulated and  <dig> were downregulated in response to blood-meal intake  <cit> . in mosquitoes, blood feeding induces expression of midgut peptidases such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, aminopeptidase, and carboxypeptidase; enzymes that may contribute to success in plasmodium infection  <cit> . changes in midgut transcript expression after a blood meal were also recently reported from the midgut of the sand fly phlebotomus papatasi  <cit> .

knowledge of the tick digestive process is even more limited. the primary nutritive element, hemoglobin, is digested intracellularly in acidic phagolysosomes of the digestion cells. most of the heme is shuttled to these specialised organelles, designated as hemosomes, where this highly reactive species is detoxified to hematin  <cit> , a non-crystalline heme aggregate similar  to malarial hemozoin  <cit> . acid phosphatase and non-specific esterases have been reported to occur in the midgut of several hard-tick species  <cit>  but their molecular structure was not identified. more recently, a cysteine peptidase was identified in the midguts of cattle ticks, rhipicephalus  microplus  <cit> , while serine peptidases were identified in the midguts of two other tick species, rhipicephalus appendiculatus  <cit>  and hæmaphysalis longicornis  <cit> . aside from these few reports, little else is known.

in view of the importance of the midgut proteins in understanding the process of blood-meal digestion as well as the fate of microbial infections, we constructed a midgut cdna library from blood-fed females of the american dog tick, d. variabilis. we obtained and analysed  <dig>  high-quality sequenced random clones from the pcr-based cdna library which generated  <dig> unique transcripts. putative functional assignments were made using blast homologies to other proteins in the national center for biotechnology information  nonredundant database  and by comparison with a specialised database containing all acari protein sequences  and the eukaryotic orthologous groups , protein families and domains  and self-monitoring, analysis, and reporting technology  protein databases. here we report the  <dig> unique transcripts assembled from these clones and the putative assignment of  <dig> of these sequences among  <dig> different major protein categories.

RESULTS
library construction
a total of  <dig>  plaque phages were sequenced from each of the two constructed cdna libraries for a total of  <dig> 5' ests. a total of  <dig>  high quality sequences, including  <dig> sequences from the 6-day-fed and  <dig> sequences from the unfed/2-day-fed libraries, were included in the bioinformatic analysis. redundant sequences were clustered into related groups using blastn and then assembled into contiguous sequences using the cap <dig> assembler yielding  <dig> unique transcripts  of which  <dig> were derived from two or more ests  and  <dig> were derived from a single est . the  <dig> unique sequences were compared using the program blastx, blastn, or rps-blast  <cit>  to the nr protein ncbi database, to a custom-prepared acari database, the gene ontology  database  <cit> , and to the ncbi conserved domains database  including kog, pfam and smart  <cit> . the three-frame translations of each sequence were inspected for the presence of a signal peptide using the signalp server  <cit> . after removal of vector sequence and poor quality sequences, all remaining sequenced cdna transcripts produced in this study were submitted to dbest, a database of expressed sequence tags  on genbank. the accession numbers for the unfed/2-day-fed cdna midgut library are ex <dig> – ex <dig> and 6-day-fed cdna midgut library accession numbers are ex <dig> – ex <dig>  transcripts for which a putative amino acid sequence could be deduced and predicted function could be ascertained were submitted to genbank .

assignment of functional classes
approximately half  of the expressed genes derived from analysis of the cdna libraries could be assigned to specific functional categories based on significant homologies to functionally assigned proteins found on genbank. using best match results to the go and kog databases as a guideline, transcripts were assigned to one of  <dig> classes based on biological function or to a group of "uncharacterised conserved function" or "unknown" class . the  <dig> classes included such biological functions as immunity, metabolism, protein export, protein synthesis and modification machinery, signal transduction, transporter, nuclear regulation, lipid binding and transcription. the majority of transcripts  were classified as unknown due to no match to any of the analysed databases or a non-significant or irrelevant match. the most abundant class, both in terms of the number unique transcripts and total ests, was classified as protein synthesis machinery which contains  <dig> concensus sequences and  <dig> singletons totaling  <dig> ests. this abundance is due, in part, to dvm  <dig> which consists of  <dig> ests. dvm  <dig> is a partial sequence and based on a blastn search against a subset mitochondrial gene database, is most related to rhipicephalus sanguineus mitochondrial dna . the remainder of this class is composed of ribosomal, mitochondrial and other housekeeping genes involved in protein synthesis. the abundance of mitochondrial and ribosomal protein coding genes is not unusual for a transcriptome analysis and illustrates the high degree of redundancy found in the libraries, especially the occurrence of numerous sequences coding for proteins involved in protein synthesis such as ribosomal rna, e.g. 40s, 60s and other ribosomal genes. the second largest functional class includes proteins involved in energy functions of metabolism  such as nadh dehydrogenase, cytochrome c oxidases, cytochome b, adenosine triphosphate  synthase and other synthetases . as with proteins associated with protein machinery, proteins involved in metabolism, energy, were highly abundant. the abundance of energy facilitating proteins is a feature consistent with the active role of the midgut in cell growth and hemoglobin digestion during blood feeding.

other notable classes of biological function include secreted proteins for which there were  <dig> concensus sequences and  <dig> singletons containing a predicted signal peptide, protein modification machinery  that contains transcripts coding for proteins involved in oxidative stress such as glutathione s-transferase  and glutaredoxins, peptidase inhibitors and amino acid  metabolism which includes cysteine, serine and aspartic peptidases. included among the transcripts in the cytoskeletal category were two singletons identified as tropomyosin  and troponin . troponin and tropomyosin together form the tropomyosin protein complex that serves as ca++ binding proteins, especially the calmodulin-like proteins, identified as clsp . these proteins are members of the calmodulin family and troponins. calmodulin is important as a signaling protein as well as a cellular regulator where it functions as a second messenger, as a regulator of calcium-dependent enzymes, and many other cellular functions. periodic contraction of the smooth muscles surrounding the midgut is believed to be important during blood feeding.

comparative analysis of the two cdna libraries indicated that each library  were evenly represented in the combined analysis with  <dig> and  <dig> unique transcripts, respectively . the average number of ests contributing to each transcript was also similar . notable exceptions to this are the categories containing aa metabolism and lipid metabolism transcripts which contain more transcripts from the 6-day-fed midgut library than the unfed/2-day-fed library .

categories of putative functions involved in tick midgut function
eighty-three transcripts  were identified as proteins putatively involved directly in blood-meal digestion by d. variabilis, based on putative biological function. these include enzymes involved in 1) oxidative stress reduction/antimicrobial activity/detoxification ; 2) peptidase inhibitors ; 3) protein digestion  ; 4) cell, protein and lipid binding, including mucins ; 5) carbohydrate digestion ; 6) immunity ; 7) iron/heme metabolism and transport ; and 8) secreted proteins . with the exception of metallopeptidases, secreted proteins and transcripts associated with lipid function and iron/heme metabolism and transport, all categories showed putative increased expression during blood feeding . table  <dig> summarises the major groups involved in blood feeding and digestion. each category will be discussed in detail below.

oxidative stress, oxidase-related antimicrobial activity or detoxification
*accession number represents transcripts derived from this analysis and submitted to genbank.

the last gst, dvm  <dig>  a peptide represented by a single est found in the unfed/2-day-fed midguts, does not match any tick or acarine species. rather, it shows a match to a gst from strongylocentrotus purpuratus and appears to be a microsomal gst <dig> . the microsomal gst superfamily, termed mapeg   <cit> , is a glutathione transferase as well as a glutathione-dependent peroxidase. there are six families of mgst including mgst <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  leukotriene c <dig> synthase , 5-lipoxygenase activating protein , and prostaglandin e synthase . insect mgst are most similar to mgst <dig> and pges, yet dvm  <dig> appears to be most related to mgst <dig> based on phylogenetic analysis  and multiple pairwise alignment . additionally, the distinctive sequence pattern of known mgst <dig> proteins, fnc qr h  -xexp, was also observed in dvm  <dig>  <cit> . d. variabilis dvm  <dig> appears to be the first mgst identified from a tick.

two transcripts, dvm  <dig> and  <dig>  each a singleton from the 6-day-fed and unfed/2-day-fed libraries, respectively , appear to be antioxidants known as thioredoxins  which facilitate the reduction of other proteins by cysteine thiol-disulfide exchange . while thioredoxins are found in nearly all known organisms, only one tick thioredoxin has been deposited in genbank . blast analysis of dvm  <dig> against the nr database revealed a high similarity  to an i. scapularis "tick-fed salivary protein 3"  identified from a salivary gland cdna library and was found to be homologous to the thioredoxin- <dig> protein  <cit> . this sequence along with dvm  <dig> was found in the same major clade with other arthropod and non-insect arthropod thioredoxin proteins  and more specifically, in a sub-clade with a thioredoxin from i. scapularis, mentioned previously, and a scorpion thioredoxin . additionally, the trx found from ticks contains the characteristic and essential cxxc motif containing the two vicinal cysteines that enable thioredoxins to reduce other proteins . in addition to the antioxidant functions of the thioredoxin family, thioredoxin- <dig>  it has been shown that when secreted by antigen presenting cells it is a potent co-stimulator for t-cell activation and growth, and thus is involved in immune functions  <cit> . dvm  <dig> appears to be the first thioredoxin found in d. variabilis and is putatively assigned to the trx- <dig> subfamily. dvm  <dig> was excluded from subsequent phylogenetic analysis due to n-terminal sequence truncation.

one transcript , a singleton, found in the 6-day-fed midgut library, was found to be homologous to another antioxidant, glutaredoxin , which is both structurally and functionally related to trxs . in vertebrates, three grx genes have been characterised; grx <dig> which is primarily cytoplasmic, grx <dig> contain nuclear and mitochondrial variants and grx <dig>  which is primarily localised in the mitochondria. some members of the grx <dig> group contain a single cysteine residue at the putative active site, whereas like all trx members, other members of the grx superfamily have a cxxc cysteine motif. dvm  <dig> was found in the clade with other grx <dig> members . no grx sequences from acarines were found on genbank, yet our transcript appears to cluster with other arthropods including an aedes ægypti glutaredoxin  to which it is most homologous . additionally, dvm  <dig> contains the catalytic site motif, cxxc . in ticks, grx may be involved in trapping reactive oxygen species that would otherwise interact with cellular thiols.

another transcript  found in the oxidative stress related group was found only in the unfed/2-day-fed midgut library of which the deduced aa sequence appears to be homologous to a phospholipid-hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase  from rhipicephalus  microplus  . phgpx, along with glutathione peroxidase  are selenoenzymes that catalyse the reduction of hydroperoxides in the presence of glutathione  <cit> . multiple pairwise alignment of dvm  <dig> to r. microplus phgpx illustrates the conserved features of this protein such as the codon tag coding for selenocysteine and the two active site aa  which interact with selenocysteine   <cit> . unlike other known phgpx proteins, dvm  <dig> as well as the phgpx from r. microplus, does not contain a signal peptide, suggesting that it exists in a cytosolic form. gpx have been identified from salivary gland-specific cdna libraries of i. pacificus  and i. scapularis , and midguts of i. ricinus  but do not share significant homology to dvm  <dig> from d. variabilis. aside from r. microplus, no other acarine phgpx has been identified until this study.

the tick midgut also shows the presence of enzymes that function as antioxidants by scavenging free radicals known as superoxide dismutase . one sod was identified in dvm  <dig> a singleton expressed in the 6-day-fed midgut library. dvm  <dig> shared significant identity with cu, znsods from various species, including a salivary gland specific cu, znsod from i. scapularis. cu, znsods catalyse superoxide anion into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide by the reduction and oxidation of a metal ion which constitutes the catalytically active redox center  <cit> . cu, znsod is important for protection against exogenous oxidative stress by converting superoxide radicals to molecular oxygen. based on metal binding patterns and signature sequence patterns, dvm  <dig> appears to be a member of the sod <dig> subfamily of superoxide dismutases  <cit>  . interestingly, cu, znsod from the bacterium hæmophilus ducreyi, a gram-negative heme obligate coccobacillus, appears to bind heme  <cit> . this suggests that this enzyme, in addition to its antioxidant properties, could function in heme trafficking that would be important in the intracellular tick bloodmeal digestion process.

transcripts for other oxidative stress peptides include a metallothionen , which may be involved in chelating heavy metals, a selenoprotein , a protein disulfide isomerase , and an aldehyde dehydrogenase  that may function to detoxify aldehydes, such as toxic byproducts resulting from lipid peroxidation  and may be involved in oxidoreductase activity. the deduced amino acid sequence of dvm  <dig> shows significant similarity to a quinoid dihydropteridine reductase from gallus gallus . quinoid dihydropteridine reductase has oxido-reductase activity involved in tetrahydrobiopterin biosysnthesis and amino acid transport and metabolism.

peptidase inhibitors
*accession number represents transcripts derived from this analysis and submitted to genbank.

two transcripts contained significant matches to serine peptidase inhibitors known as serpins, dvm  <dig> with  <dig> est and  <dig> with two ests, all expressed in 6-day-fed midguts . serpins are important regulators of serine peptidases involved in inflammation, blood coagulation, fibrinolysis and complement activation  <cit> . serine peptidase inhibitors include members of the kazal, kunitz, α-macroglobin and serpin families. serine peptidase inhibitors function in insect hemolymph for protection from infection by pathogens or parasites  <cit> . dvm  <dig> contains a full-length sequence and is most closely related to lospin  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> from amblyomma americanum  <cit>  that are three of  <dig> serpins found in the lone star tick . in a. americanum serpins are expressed ubiquitously in the midgut, salivary glands and ovaries with lospin  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> having the greatest expression in the midgut  <cit> . serpins contain a conserved domain  and a reactive center loop, -, which is conserved among ticks including our transcript . dvm  <dig> is 5' truncated yet it contained a significant match to a serpin from h. longicornis .

two singletons  contained a significant match to a protein named boophilin identified from the cattle tick, r. microplus . although not definitively characterised, boophilin appears to be related to a thrombin inhibitor  <cit> . similar to boophilin, both transcripts contain two conserved kunitz domains  and are closely related to a conserved domain for bpti /kunitz family of serine peptidase inhibitors. this domain contains a characteristic disulfide-rich alpha+beta fold as well as a trypsin interaction site . dvm  <dig> and  <dig> contain two kunitz domains and  <dig> cysteine residues that together create three disulfide bridges, although dvm  <dig> is 5' truncated, therefore the first three cysteines of the first domain are absent . a thrombin inhibitor has been identified and functionally characterised from one hard tick, amblyomma hebræum   <cit>  and two soft tick, ornithodoros moubata   <cit>  and o. savignyi,   <cit> . the prototype for this family, bpti, contains two recognition loops, the first of which contains a single aa  that is the principle determinant of inhibitor specificity. polymorphisms in these loops contribute to individual species specificity; bpti inhibits trypsins and boophilin, ambilin and ornithodorin inhibit thrombin. the exact mechanism through which thrombin is inhibited is not understood for hard ticks. the binding appears to be novel in soft ticks, such that neither of the reactive site loops contact the peptidase in the ornithodorin-thrombin complex; rather, the interaction is through the n-terminal residues  <cit> . it is unknown if the two proteins identified from d. variabilis are, in fact, thrombin inhibitors and, if so, if they bind in the same manner as ornithodorin. preliminary examination of the sequences obtained from d. variabilis suggests an alternative method.

deduced aa sequences of three singletons, dvm  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> shared identity to cysteine peptidase known as cystatins. all three consensus sequences were truncated at the n-terminus; thus complete sequences could not be evaluated. dvm  <dig> appears to be identical to dvm  <dig>  yet is significantly more truncated and thus is not represented in the alignments or phylogenetic analysis. based on multiple pairwise alignment and phylogenetic analysis, there appears to be two cytoplasmic and one secreted cystatin found in the cdna libraries from d. variabilis midguts . dvm  <dig> appears to be most related to r. microplus putative intracellular cystatin  and i. scapularis cytoplasmic cystatin . although the aminoterminal region is missing, based on phylogenetic similarity we can presume that dvm  <dig> is a cytoplasmic cystatin . unlike secreted cystatins, intracellular cystatins do not present with predicted disulfide bonds which is observed among our putative cytoplasmic transcripts . dvm  <dig> appears to be a secreted cystatin based on phylogenetic analysis . grunclova et al.  <cit>  described two secreted cystatins from the soft tick o. moubata. dvm  <dig>  is most similar to the two secreted cystatins from the soft tick as well as known secreted cystatins from i. scapularis, o. parkeri, i. ricinus and h. longicornis. although no signal peptide is present, due to 5' truncation we have tentatively identified this transcript as a secreted cystatin. dvm  <dig> conforms with other known cystatins  <cit>  such that the molecule has three papain-binding areas and four conserved cysteines that create two disulfide bridges . the three papain-binding areas are thought to create a wedge-shaped binding site involved in reversible binding in the active site of cystatin peptidase of the papain family  <cit> . grunclova et al.  <cit>  found that the gut specific o. moubata and midgut i. ricinus cystatins shared the third papain-binding site, characterised by a pw hairpin loop. this was not seen among salivary gland i. scapularis cystatins but we find this motif in the midgut-specific d. variabilis dvm  <dig> . in all cystatins from d. variabilis, the qnvlg or qvvag domain is conserved as in other cystatins . cystatins are important in disrupting the activity of cysteine peptidases, enzymes that are essential for several pathogenic parasites and bacteria. thus, cystatins not only have the capacity to regulate normal biological processes but may also participate in the defense against microbial infections  <cit> .

peptidases
peptidases comprise the largest number of putative expressed genes associated with bloodmeal digestion. twenty-six transcripts consisting of  <dig> ests were divided among four major groups of pepidases found in the midgut of d. variabilis; serine, aspartic, cysteine and metallo .

*accession number represents transcripts derived from this analysis and submitted to genbank.

serine peptidases
trypsins and chymotrypsins are the most extensively studied digestive serine peptidases in haematophagous insects. five transcripts were found that matched serine peptidases, all found only in the 6-day-fed midguts. three transcripts  showed high levels of similarity to serine peptidases from other tick species. all three transcripts were truncated at the aminoterminus, thus no secretion potential could be evaluated. miyoshi et al  <cit>  described a serine peptidase from h. longicornis  that contained the three conserved catalytic aa typical for chymotrypsin-like proteins . alignment of dvm  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> with h. longicornis and other tick serine peptidases from genbank revealed the extent of the 5' truncation of the three d. variabilis transcripts, yet for dvm  <dig> the second  and third  catalytic aa in the trypsin catalytic triad were conserved . additionally, although we were only able to sequence the 3' fragments of the protein, dvm  <dig> contains the conserved serine whereas dvm  <dig> contained an isoleucine in place of the serine. as seen in other hemotophogus arthropods  <cit> , it may be possible that some of the serine peptidases found in the tick midgut may be associated with immunity rather then digestive function.

two transcripts  were found to be most closely related to serine carboxypeptidases. serine carboxypeptidases  are proteolytic enzymes that exploit serine in their catalytic activity, as with chymotrypsins, scp have a catalytic triad of serine, aspartate and histidine  whereas chymotrypsins have the hds triad, which catalyses hydrolysis of c-terminal residues in peptides and proteins as acidic ph. a scp from h. longicornis  was described by motobu et al.  <cit> , which contained the catalytic triad at positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  alignment of dvm  <dig> with a scp from h. longicornis, a salivary scp from i. scapularis and a scp from the jewel wasp, nasonia vitripennis illustrates that, although truncated at the n-terminus, dvm  <dig> contains the second  and third  aa of the triad . without further analysis of the full-gene product, it is impossible to determine whether the first catalytic aa is conserved. based on identity with n. vitripennis , it seems probable that dvm  <dig> and dvm  <dig> are midgut serine carboxypeptidases.

aspartic peptidases
three transcripts putatively assigned as aspartic peptidases were identified in the midgut libraries. aspartic peptidases are a family of proteins that include pepsins, cathepsin d, cathepsin e and renins, and are believed to be important in hemoglobin proteolysis  <cit> . these enzymes are involved in degradation of intracellular and endocytosed proteins and thus have been implicated in blood meal digestion in some ectoparasites, such as mites  <cit>  and ticks  <cit> . aspartic peptidases have also been implicated in hemoglobin  proteolysis  <cit> . among ticks, an aspartic peptidase named byc from r. microplus appears to be involved in vitellin  digestion as well as heme binding  <cit> . we identified transcripts similar to an aspartic peptidase, cathepsin d .

three transcripts  contained significant matches to a peptidase in h. longicornis named longepsin , which is known to cleave hemoglobin. all three transcripts were found only in the midguts from 6-day-fed ticks; no clones were found in unfed or 2-day-fed ticks. dvm  <dig> and  <dig> were extensively 5' truncated, thus were removed from phylogenetic analysis . dvm  <dig> and  <dig> are probably aspartic peptidases since they have an aspartic acid domain, i.e., asp-thr-gly  catalytic site motif also found in h. longicornis  <cit>  and several other cathepsin d peptidases necessary for its enzymatic activity . this enzyme is typically found in lysosomes. boldbaatar et al.  <cit>  suggest that in h. longicornis, this enzyme "plays an integral role in the proteolysis of erythrocyte hb obtained from a host blood meal." the occurrence of a similar aspartic peptidase in the d. variabilis midgut suggests that it also is likely associated with hemoglobin digestion. phylogenetic analysis revealed that dvm  <dig> is most closely related to h. longicornis aspartic peptidase and is found in the same sub-clade as other tick cathepsin-d proteins , and is also within a major clade containing other arthropod cathepsins .

cysteine peptidases
fourteen transcripts were found, comprising either multiple or single sequences, that matched cysteine peptidases in the acari and/or nr databases and at least one of the cdd databases. of the  <dig> total est containing homology to cysteine peptidases,  <dig> ests were found in the 6-day-fed midguts, whereas only  <dig> ests were found in the 2-day-fed library, suggesting that the expression of this protein family is induced during feeding . phylogenetic analysis revealed three major groups of cysteine peptidases identified among the two cdna libraries; legumain-like, cathepsin b-like and cathepsin l-like .

dvm  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> share significant sequence similarity to a legumain-like protease from i. ricinus. legumain-like proteases are members of the cystein peptidase family  and act specifically as asparaginyl endopeptidases with strict cleavage specificity. asparaginyl endopeptidases  appear to process other proteins and have been found to be involved in peptide processing before mhc-ii loading  <cit> , protein processing during seed germination, and, possibly the most relevant to the hematophagous behavior of ticks, ae have been shown to activate cathepsin zymogens in the gut of blood feeding helminthes such as schistosoma mansoni – allowing hb digestion  <cit> . recently, ae orthologs have been described in two hard ticks, i. ricinus  <cit>  and h. longicornis  <cit> . each has been shown to function as hemoglobinase. of the three transcripts found in the d. variabilis library, two  appear to be 5' truncated thus were removed from phylogenetic analysis. the third transcript, dvm  <dig>  appears to be full length and contains a signal peptide , indicating its likely secretion from the cell. dvm  <dig> shares 69% identity with i. ricinus  and 74% identity with h. longicornis  tick legumain and is found in a clade with other known tick-derived ae . alignment of the three known tick ae is shown in figure 15b. the residues his and cys, involved in forming the catalytic dyad of ae, are conserved among all three ticks including the transcript identified in this analysis . dvm  <dig> and  <dig> each contain two ests found in the six days post-attachment midguts, whereas dvm  <dig> is a singleton expressed in the midgut of unfed or 2-day-fed ticks. the three transcripts share 97% aa similarity with only five aa differences between them; yet without the entire sequence it is impossible to know if the three share a similar function. potential differences in the n-terminus could explain why the two truncated transcripts are found in the midguts of the 6-day-fed ticks

dvm  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> shared significant identities with cathepsin-b endopeptidases, while dvm  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were most similar to cathespsin-l cysteine peptidases. dvm  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were similar to midgut cysteine peptidases from r. appendiculatus. with the exception of dvm  <dig>  all other transcripts were 5' truncated. based on homology to known proteins, dvm  <dig> contains a predicted signal cleavage site  suggesting secretion from the cell . multiple sequence alignment of tick cysteine peptidases indicated that the aa involved in the catalytic dyad , which are present in all papain-like cysteine peptidases, were conserved among the tick species, with the exception of dvm  <dig>  which did not contain cys . it has been shown that two other residues play an important role in catalysis, a gln preceding the catalytic cys, believed to help in the formation of the oxyanion hole, and an asn residue which orients the imidazolium ring of the catalytic his. as with the catalytic dyad, gln and cys were also conserved among the d. variabilis transcripts. although there was little homology among the entire length of sequences, the residues surrounding the catalytic aa were equally conserved .

metallopeptidases
four putative metallopeptidases were found among the transcripts. all were found only in the midguts from unfed/2-day-fed ticks. results from the nr and go database identified a pa2g4-like  conserved domain in dvm  <dig>  whereas a match to a metallopeptidase was identified based on a search of the kog database . pa2g <dig> is related to an aminopeptidase m which is implicated in cell-cycle control. one metallopeptidase, dvm  <dig>  was homologous to an i. scapularis salivary gland secreted protein, is <dig> , based on searches of the nr and acari databases. dvm  <dig>  related to a metallopeptidase, is homologous to a membrane-type  <dig> matrix metalloproteinase cytoplasmic tail binding protein- <dig>  based on comparison to the nr database. a final metallopeptidase, dvm  <dig>  appears to have mitochondrial processing peptidase activity and is related enzymes in the insulinase super family  based on the best match to the kog database . in all four examples, the protein appears to be truncated, thus functional active sites indicative of metallopeptidases remain to be confirmed.

lipid binding
*accession number represents transcripts derived from this analysis and submitted to genbank.

the most abundant group associated with lipid binding contains four transcripts comprised of nine est and is homologous to mucins. dvm  <dig> and  <dig> contain a putative secretory peptide while dvm  <dig> and  <dig> appear to be cytoplasmic proteins likely found on the cell membranes. mucins are important in coating the lining epithelium of the gut, which contributes to their role as mucosal barriers. dvm  <dig> and  <dig> share identity with a conserved domain, cbm_ <dig>  a chitin binding peritrophin-a domain characterised by an extracellular domain that contains six conserved cysteines, forming three disulfide bridges . dvm  <dig>  derived from six ests, found in both the unfed/2-day-fed and 6-day-fed midguts, also shows a match to an allergen-like protein from the dust mite, dermatophagoides farinæ. however, this sequence contains a conserved domain  similar to mucin-like glycoproteins in the midgut peritrophic membrane of insects  <cit> . dvm  <dig>  with one sequence found only in the unfed/2-day-fed midguts, shows a match to a mucin-like peritrophin sequence from the soft tick o. moubata as well as the chitin-binding peritrophin-a domain, a characteristic feature of the peritrophic membrane . the acellular peritrophic membrane, which forms within as little as  <dig> –  <dig> h after the commencement of feeding  <cit>  lies close to the luminal surface of the epithelium where it protects the gut against injurious particulates and ingested microbes. it has been described from several species of ticks  <cit> . while dvm  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are closely related to other tick mucins, it is interesting to note how similar the mucins from d. variabilis midguts are with putative peritrophins from two sand fly species, lutzomyia longipalpis and phlebotomus papatasi .

glycine rich proteins were also abundant in this midgut category. three of these putative proteins, dvm  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  were found only in the unfed/2-day-fed midguts, while the fourth, dvm  <dig>  was found only in the 6-day-fed midguts. dvm  <dig> was also a secreted protein. each of the glycine rich proteins was similar to tick salivary gland cement-like proteins. tick cement proteins are characterised by glycine rich aa repeats that occur as glg  tripeptides and may also show a gsplsgf septapeptide  <cit> . all four of the putative glycine rich proteins showed variations of the tripeptides; dvm  <dig> also contained the septapeptide. dvm  <dig> showed 52% identity with rim <dig>  a cement protein from the salivary glands of r. appendiculatus  that contributes to the formation of the attachment cement. in contrast, dvm  <dig> and  <dig> showed the highest similarities, 39% and 40%, respectively, to a similar glycine rich cement protein from i. scapularis. the role of glycine rich proteins in the tick midgut is currently unknown.

several transcripts were tentatively identified as membrane surface receptors/antigens. two transcripts , show a match to bm <dig>  a membrane-bound surface protein from hyalomma anatolicum  as well as bm <dig> homologues from r. microplus, h. longicornis and r. sanguineus. bm <dig> is similar to mammalian angiotensin-converting enzyme and, therefore, may function in a similar role in ticks  <cit> . both appear to be glycoproteins; dvm  <dig> also shows a match for the von willebrand factor, which contributes to platelet  clumping. both transcripts are 5' truncated by approximately  <dig> aa, yet along the approximately  <dig> aa of the 3' ends they are considerably conserved to other bm86-like proteins found in ticks, particularly along the cysteine framework .

a noteworthy finding was dvm  <dig>  which showed a match for trospa, the i. scapularis midgut cell surface protein that binds to borrelia burgdorferi spirochetes. this protein was found only in the unfed/2-day-fed ticks. although the match is relatively poor, this finding may merit further study. to date, trospa has only been reported from i. scapularis  <cit> .

transcripts related to immunity within the midgut
eight transcritps contained proteins putatively involved in immunity in the gut of the tick . the most abundant transcripts in this group are putative allergen-like proteins containing ml domains . two  of the five transcripts associated with allergen-like proteins were found in both the unfed/2-day-fed and 6-day-fed midguts, while dvm  <dig> and  <dig>  both singletons, were expressed only in the 6-day-fed midguts; dvm  <dig>  a singleton, was found in the unfed/2-day-fed midguts. dvm  <dig>  present in both the unfed/2-day-fed and 6-day-fed midguts, is a secreted protein. the others are cytoplasmic or of indeterminate status. all five transcripts showed a match for the ml lipid recognition domain and all match allergen-like proteins or ml domains from other tick species, namely i. ricinus , which was found to be induced by a borrelia infected bloodmeal in the midgut of this tick  <cit> . dvm  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> share significant homology with e1_derp2_derf <dig> protein domain  belonging to a family of ml domain-containing proteins that is a lipid recognition domain found in plants, fungi, animals and also includes the dust mite allergen der p  <dig>  these transcripts appear to code for a protein similar to the dermatophagoides pteronyssius mite allergen , a lipid-binding protein which had the closest match to a similar protein in ixodes ricinus, and other proteins of unknown function. these proteins are implicated in pathogen recognition, particularly recognition of pathogen-related lipids and involved in innate immunity and lipid metabolism  <cit> . two transcripts, dvm  <dig> and  <dig>  contain a ml lipid recognition domain also present in niemann-pick type c <dig> -type proteins and the phosphatidylinositol/phosphatidylglycerol transfer protein . the latter is a ubiquitous cytosolic protein of eukaryotic cells that transports phospholipids from the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi to other cell membranes  <cit> . both transcripts were found in the clade with other ml domain containing acari species . allergen-like proteins are believed to be important in innate immunity by recognising and binding to lipids found on microbes, including pathogenic microbes ingested with the blood meal. multiple pairwise alignment of tick ml domain-containing proteins revealed the conserved cysteine framework found in allergen-like proteins was also conserved in two d. variabilis derived sequences, dvm  <dig> and  <dig>  as well as conserved aa involved in putative lipid binging activity . in the context of the intracellular digestion of the bloodmeal, these ml-like proteins could be associated with lipid absorption form the phagolysosomes, a role that clearly needs more investigation.

the two transcripts tentatively identified as dorin m-like proteins  show matches to a fibrinogen-domain containing lectin-like protein found in the hemolymph of o. moubata  <cit> ; a similar lectin-like protein, ixoderin, also occurs in i. ricinus. dvm  <dig> was found to show 25% identity to ixoderin and 22% and 24% identity, respectively, to the two lectins from o. moubata. these proteins are similar to fibrinogens and show the characteristic fibrinogen domain  <cit> . notably, ixoderin was also found in the midgut of i. ricinus  <cit> . dvm  <dig> also contained a signal peptide, similar to the other tick, insect and human lectins that were compared. this transcript was confirmed as a dorin-m lectin by tryptic digestion/mass spectrometry . a second transcript  tentatively identified as a lectin, showed little similarity to any of the known lectins; its identity is uncertain. lectins are believed to play an important role in antimicrobial activity in the hemolymph of ticks  <cit>  as well as in the midgut of many blood-feeding insects  <cit> .

the last protein we can include in this group is dvm  <dig>  which is similar to the macrophage migration inhibitory factor  also found in the tick, amblyomma americanum , as well as many other invertebrates. this protein was found in both the unfed/2-day-fed and 6-day-fed ticks. mif proteins have dopachrome isomerase activity, a function in arthropods provided by members of the yellow family which is involved in melanization  <cit> .

transcripts related to iron/heme metabolism and transport
two transcripts tentatively identified as ferritins were recognised, both were found only in the unfed/2-day-fed midguts  . dvm  <dig>  with  <dig> ests, is a predicted secreted protein, while dvm  <dig>  with  <dig> ests, is a predicted cytoplasmic protein. both show an excellent match to similar sequences from d. andersoni and d. variabilis, as well as the conserved ferritin domain . ferritin is important as an iron storage reservoir and in protection against iron overload. mosquitoes, for example, synthesise and secrete ferritin in response to iron exposure in direct relationship to iron dose  <cit> . a tick heavy chain ferritin was recently shown by mulenga et al.  <cit>  to be upregulated in response to mechanical injury and bacterial infection, thus suggesting its role in anti-microbial activity. phylogenetic analysis of dvm  <dig> and  <dig> reveal the conserved nature of ferritins among tick species . dvm  <dig> is found in the clade containing other dermacentor species and is highly similar to a published ferritin from d. variabilis ; therefore, this transcript does not appear to be a novel ferritin . dvm  <dig> is found in the same clade as a horseshoe crab  ferritin which is ancestral to the tick-derived ferritins . the placement of dvm  <dig> in this clade, yet separate from arthropod light chain ferritins, suggests that it is either a novel ferritin or is involved in a unique function, not previously identified. the conserved aa involved in the ferroxidase diiron center is conserved among the tick ferritins excluding dvm  <dig>  in which the second aa of the domain is a lysine rather than a tyrosine, which may contribute to the divergence from other tick ferritins . dvm  <dig> is tentatively assigned as an erythrocyte-binding protein, although the match is poor . another transcript, dvm  <dig>  tentatively assigned as a housekeeping protein, may actually function in erythrocyte binding since it shows a good match  to the clathrin adaptor protein in d. variabilis and to the clathrin adapter domain in similar proteins found in insects and ticks. clathrin-coated pits are essential for the binding and internalisation of hemoglobin by pinocytosis  <cit> .

secreted proteins similar to tick salivary proteins
five transcripts were similar to proteins secreted in the saliva of ticks. each transcript contained a significant match to a protein identified from a tissue-specific cdna library of dissected salivary glands. dvm  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were found only in the unfed/2-day-fed midguts, whereas dvm  <dig> was found in the 6-day-fed guts. two transcripts  had clear signal peptides, whereas the putative secretion of dvm  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> is based on homology to other known secreted proteins.

unknown, unassigned transcripts
this group comprised transcripts that had low confidence matches in the nr and/or acari databases, or both, or had conflicting tentative assignments with relatively low matches. although many were short and incomplete sequences, others were long or appeared to be complete sequences and may represent novel genes. many  were secreted proteins. the reader may access these sequences for further study accessing the the supplemental data given in the methods section of this report.

protein identifications
tryptic digestion/mass spectrometry   provided supporting evidence for the functional assignment of the following transcripts found in the midgut library: 1)  <dig> kd heat shock protein; 2) gst ; 3) cytochrome b <dig> ; 4) histone ; 5) paramyosin ; and 6) bm <dig> membrane glycoprotein ; and 7) glycogen phosphorylase . other proteins found in the tryptic digest but not in the cdna library were: 1) prenyl cysteine oxidase; 2) a statin-related protein ; and 3) a hemelipoglycoprotein precursor  . the latter is noteworthy in view of reports of the role of the female tick midgut as a secondary site of synthesis of vitellogenin, a known hemelipoglycoprotein, as well as in the fat body  <cit> . attempts to identify proteins isolated from pvdf blots by edman degradation were unsuccessful because they were n-terminally blocked.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we constructed a pcr-based cdna library from the midguts of unfed/2-day-fed and 6-day-fed virgin females of the tick d. variabilis and analysed  <dig>  high-quality randomly sequenced ests. we obtained partial or full-length information on proteins and peptides, most of which appear to be novel. no transcripts were found from rabbits, the host on which the ticks had been fed. in addition to functional assignments based on the criteria described previously, we confirmed the identity of seven proteins by tryptic digestion/mass fingerprinting of bands eluted from sds-page gels of midgut extracts, as well as four other proteins for which no transcripts were found.

comparison of the transcripts from the unfed/2-day-fed versus the 6-day-fed ticks indicates that most of the sequences were found in the latter; few were found in both. this was especially true for the peptidases;  <dig> of the  <dig> transcripts in this category were expressed in the 6-day-fed midguts, and only three appeared in both. the same pattern is evident for the peptidase inhibitors , hydrolases  and oxidative stress proteins . this is not surprising, since little blood is imbibed during the first two days after attachment. however, several functionally important proteins and peptides were found to have been expressed in the early feeding period, especially 1) the cell/protein/lipid-binding proteins that include erythrocyte and hemoglobin-binding proteins; eight of these were found in the unfed/2-day-fed midguts and one were found in both; 2) peritrophin, responsible for formation of the peritrophic membrane, but absent in the later feeding period; and 3) cysteine and metallo-peptidases, peptidase inhibitors and oxidative stress proteins, many of which may have an antimicrobial role.

the library shows a remarkable degree of redundancy, a finding previously reported for the salivary gland cdna library  <cit> . especially noteworthy is the large number of cysteine and serine peptidases, serpins, hydrolases, gsts, dehydrogenase and other free-radical reducing enzymes, and the numerous binding proteins. such duplication is consistent with the finding of extensive gene duplication for genes of great functional value in the blood feeding process, as suggested by ribeiro et al.  <cit> . only  <dig> of the  <dig>  transcripts showed signal peptides, indicating that most were involved in intracellular processes in contrast to the salivary glands, where a much higher proportion  comprised secreted proteins  <cit> . less than half had functional assignments based on the criteria described above. the large number of peptidases and peptidase inhibitors is consistent with the intracellular digestive processes characteristic of these ticks.

as might be expected, the largest category of transcripts in the library, with  <dig> transcripts, comprised the housekeeping proteins, subdivided into a least  <dig> functional groups. most represented transcripts for rna structural proteins, transcription/translational activity, metabolism, cellular and mitochondrial oxidative respiration, antioxidant activity, proteasome machinery, and other housekeeping activities. the remaining non-housekeeping proteins were much less numerous. of special interest are the proteins concerned with blood-meal digestion, especially the peptidases and peptidase inhibitors. when ticks feed and ingest blood, the hemoglobin liberated from lysis of the erythrocytes binds to the luminal surfaces of the midgut epithelial cells. there it is absorbed and incorporated into phagolysosomes where it is digested  <cit> . studies by more recent workers have shown the presence in the tick midgut of cysteine peptidases  <cit> , unidentified aspartic and cysteine peptidases  <cit>  and uncharacterised cysteine and serine peptidases  <cit> . aside from the serine peptidases from the midguts of r. appendiculatus and h. longicornis  <cit>  and an aspartic peptidase from h. longicornis  <cit> , none were sequenced or their molecular structure identified. these enzymes showed greatest activity at acid phs, suggesting that they are lysosomal peptidases. however, none have reported as many different peptidases as were recognised in the d. variabilis cdna midgut library described in this paper. only four, transcrips dvm  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were secreted proteins, indicating that most of these peptidases were functioning in intracellular protein digestion, presumably digestion of endocytosed hemoglobin within the digestive cells. three of the cysteine peptidases, dvm  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  included a conserved domain for the legumain-like peptidase associated with hemoglobinase, further supporting the putative role of these peptidases in blood-meal digestion. others, such as aspartic peptidases and serine peptidases also were found without signal peptides, suggesting they are concerned within intracellular protein digestion  in the phagolysosome.

metallopeptidases are also of interest, of which four were found in the midgut library. evidence from insects suggests that they may be important in cellular immune defense  <cit> . interestingly, a metallopeptidase from the tick i. scapularis was shown to contain fibrin and fibrinogen activities, revealing yet another potential function of the metallopeptidases found here  <cit> . similarities with known peptidases in other ticks, other acarines and insects were relatively low , suggesting that most of these midgut peptidases are novel. another noteworthy finding is the large number of transcripts known to function as antimicrobial agents, e.g., pathogen-recognition proteins, or in a dual role, e.g., as oxidative stress reduction and innate immune peptides. in haematophagous insects, microbes ingested with the blood meal provoke an effective defense by upregulating lectins, lysozyme, defensins, cercropins and other antimicrobial peptides  <cit> . this study suggests that an exceptionally large number of innate immune peptides or proteins occur in the midgut. among these are the nine different peptidase inhibitors found in the d. variabilis midgut library. although many peptidase inhibitors have been reported from ticks, most were from the salivary glands or hemolymph. a search of the literature showed four serpins in r. appendiculatus expressed in various tick organs in addition to salivary glands and midguts  <cit>  but only one from the midgut of h. longicornis  <cit> . a cystatin reported from the midguts and hemocytes of h. longicornis  <cit>  was found to increase up to  <dig>  times greater when the ticks were exposed to babesia gibsoni or b. bovis, while the recombinant protein inhibited growth of b. bovis grown in culture. the finding of numerous transcripts for serpins and cystatins in the d. variabilis midgut suggests an important role for those proteins in innate immune defense. other proteins expressed during blood feeding probably play a role in defense against microbial invasions. included is the von willebrand factor peptide, an anti-clotting factor that also occurs in i. ricinus after b. burgdorferi challenge  <cit> , the ml-domain proteins and the lectins. ml-domain proteins function as pathogen recognition proteins. the 6-day-fed midguts were also found to contain two sequences for dorin m lectin-like peptides. several lectins have also been reported from ticks, including dorin m from the hemolymph of o. moubata  <cit>  and ixoderin from the salivary glands and midgut of i. ricinus  <cit> . lectins bind to sialic acid, hexosamines and other compounds characteristic of the cell walls of bacteria and fungi and, consequently, they are important in defence against invading microbes and preventing pathogen/parasite transmission.

it has now become increasingly clear that the midgut of ticks presents a hostile environment for ingested microbes. this is evident not only because of the presence of the more familiar antimicrobial peptides , but also because of the expression of oxidative stress-reducing, detoxifying and lipid- or protein-binding peptides that confer antimicrobial properties, e.g., gsts, metallothioneins, peroxiredoxins, midgut lectins and a large number of peptidases. microbial infection is known to cause oxidative stress, leading to upregulation of gsts, peroxiredoxins and other oxidative stress-reducing proteins  <cit> . clearly, the arsenal of antimicrobial agents is considerably more extensive than just defensin or lysozyme, which are either poorly expressed or absent. indeed, in d. variabilis, the midgut lysozyme message was not significantly upregulated by blood-feeding  <cit>  and no evidence of either the lysozyme or defensin peptides was observed in other studies of the midgut of this tick  <cit> , although it is strongly upregulated following the blood meal in o. moubata  <cit> . however, it is possible that defensin peptide was overlooked. this peptide is known to bind with a serine peptidase to form an sds-stable complex with an apparent molecular weight >  <dig> kda in the blood-sucking fly stomoxys calcitrans  <cit> . in addition to the native tick proteins, fragments of hemoglobin digestion also contribute to destruction of ingested microbes  <cit> . bacteria such as bacillus subtilis, escherischia coli and borrelia burgdorferi, fed to d. variabilis females by capillary oral feeding were taken into the midgut, but none could be re-cultured within  <dig> h after exposure. when midguts of these ticks were examined by electron microscopy, intact b. burgdorferi and rod-shaped bodies resembling e. coli were found in several samples  <cit> . since lytic activity does not appear to be the primary antimicrobial response, it is interesting to speculate that the dorin m-like lectin and the several secreted cysteine and aspartic peptidases noted previously may kill or at least inhibit the survival of these organisms in the midgut lumen. in contrast to d. variabilis, e. coli cells ingested into the midgut of the soft tick, o. moubata, were found to survive in the midgut lumen for up to  <dig> days, and were destroyed gradually only after they were endocytosed within the midgut epithelial cells  <cit> . within the midgut lining cells, the upregulation of lectins or lectin-like proteins, numerous gsts, aldehyde dehydrogenase, metallothionein, sod and other oxidative stress enzymes in response to hemoglobin uptake and digestion would also contribute to the destruction of invasive microbes.

the authors recognise that the cdna midgut library is an exploratory catalogue of transcripts expressed in this tissue in feeding females and is most likely incomplete. although functional assignments could be made for approximately 45% of the concensus sequences and singletons, the remainder could not be assigned, often because they were not full-length sequences. other classes of proteins and peptide transcripts previously reported in the midgut were not recognised, e.g., defensin  <cit> , lysozyme  <cit> , heme transferases and integrins. this annotated catalogue of midgut transcripts from the midgut of a blood-fed hard tick may be useful to scientists wishing to investigate the role of tick midgut in bloodmeal digestion as well as its ability to cope with oxidative stress, antimicrobial activity or the passage of the tick-borne pathogens acquired during blood feeding. most of the  <dig> putatively identified transcripts expressed in this library appear to be novel. similarly, the remaining unidentified transcripts also lack significant similarities to known tick or insect proteins. this report makes all available for inspection and further study.
