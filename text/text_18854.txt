BACKGROUND
neural adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily mediate cell-cell recognition by homo- or heterophilic ca2+-independent cell surface interactions  <cit> . l <dig>  a member of this family, promotes neurite outgrowth and fasciculation, and is involved in axonal pathfinding, neuronal migration, regeneration and synaptic plasticity  <cit> . targeted ablation of l <dig> in mice leads to hydrocephalus, corpus callosum hypoplasia, and malformation of the corticospinal tract resembling mutations in the human l <dig> gene that result in an x-linked recessive neurological disorder called x-linked hydrocephalus, masa syndrome or spastic paraplegia type i  . these observations in mice and man point to a key role of l <dig> in development of the nervous system.

in the control region of the mouse l <dig> gene, a neural restrictive silencer element  was identified which is responsible for the neuronal expression of l <dig> during embryonic development and serves as a tissue-specific silencer and enhancer in postnatal animals  <cit> . moreover, the transcription factors pax- <dig>  hoxa- <dig>  and barx <dig> bind to the murine l <dig> gene regulatory region, and pax- <dig> activates mouse l <dig> gene expression  <cit> . more recent studies have identified two additional activators of l <dig> transcription, lef-1/tcf in human colorectal cancer cells  <cit> , and klf <dig> in olfactory sensory neurons  <cit> . nuclear factor i-a , a member of the nuclear factor i  family of site-specific transcription factors, is a good candidate for controlling l <dig> transcription, as it regulates the expression of several neural proteins and thereby governs development of the central nervous system in mice and men . in the present study, we tested whether nfi-a binds to the murine l <dig> gene regulatory region and influences l <dig> gene expression.

methods
plasmid constructs
the l <dig> reporter plasmid l1- <dig>  <cit> , a kind gift from dr. p. kallunki , contains  <dig> bp upstream of exon  <dig> of the mouse l <dig> gene, exon  <dig>  intron  <dig>  exon  <dig> with the luciferase cdna inserted to replace the l <dig> start codon by the luciferase start codon, intron  <dig> including the neural restrictive silencer element, exon  <dig>  intron  <dig> and exon  <dig>  the nfi-a expression plasmid pchnfi-a has been described previously  <cit>  and expresses the hemagglutinin  epitope-tagged  <cit>  murine ortholog of chicken nfi-a <dig>   <cit> , which, in this paper, is called "standard isoform" due to its widespread expression in various tissues of adult mice  <cit> . to express the brain-specific isoform of mouse nfi-a  <cit>  in an ha epitope-tagged form, pchbnfi-a was used, which was constructed analogously to pchnfi-a. a plasmid which expresses brain-specific nfi-a lacking most of the activation domain  was created by digesting the parental vector with bstxi and kpni. 3' overhangs were removed by incubation with platinum pfx dna polymerase  at 68°c for  <dig> min, and the resulting blunt ends were ligated using the rapid dna ligation kit . for chip experiments, myc-tagged expression constructs for the standard and brain-specific nfi-a isoforms were made by cutting out the ha tag with noti and sfii from pchnfi-a and pchbnfi-a, respectively. two oligonucleotides, nfi-myc  <dig>  and nfi-myc  <dig>  , which contain the coding sequence of the myc epitope combined with kozak box, start codon and the compatible nucleotide overhangs, were annealed. the resulting double-stranded oligonucleotide was added to a 5- <dig> fold excess of the respective noti/sfii-digested nfi-a expression vector, and ligated using the rapid dna ligation kit.

RESULTS
identification of a full nfi binding site in the first intron of the mouse l <dig> gene
to ask whether nfi-a binds to the murine l <dig> gene regulatory region, we analyzed the nucleotide sequence of this region  <cit>  for nfi binding sites, using the lasergene  software suite. we identified the sequence ttggcttggtgccaa, which fully matches the nfi consensus motif, ttggc5gccaa  <cit> , in intron  <dig>  located  <dig> bp upstream of the translation start codon in the second exon . the same part of the mouse l <dig> gene regulatory region also contains a previously identified dna element recognized by pax- <dig> and by additional homeodomain proteins  <cit>  . in addition to the full binding site, we found eight half binding sites for nfi proteins located within the  <dig> bp immediately upstream of the full site .

nfi-a binds to the regulatory region of the mouse l <dig> gene in vitro
to assess binding of nfi-a to the full nfi recognition motif in the l <dig> gene regulatory region in vitro, electrophoretic mobility shift assays  were performed, using both the ubiquitous "standard" isoform of nfi-a  and a brain-specific isoform   <cit> . their unique n-termini of  <dig>  and  <dig> amino acids  are generated by alternative splicing  <cit>  . both ha-tagged isoforms were expressed in cho cells . cell extracts were incubated with oligonucleotides containing either the newly identified full binding site in the mouse l <dig> gene , or an idealized nfi binding site  . to control for binding specificity, a g→c point mutation eliminating an essential gn <dig> contact for nfi was introduced into both oligonucleotides, yielding lc and nc, respectively . both nfi-a st and nfi-a bs expression caused a significant shift of the l and n oligonucleotides . neither the lc nor the nc oligonucleotide were shifted, indicating that the guanosine in position  <dig> of the motif is critical for nfi-a binding and that the complex is formed by sequence-specific interaction of nf1-a with both elements. moreover, no gel shift was observed for the unrelated sis oligonucleotide   <cit> , which does not contain an nfi recognition motif. extracts without forced nfi-a expression  gave rise to faster mobility complexes. these complexes most likely represent endogenous nfi isoforms as indicated by the lack of binding to the mutant lc, nc and c oligos. the heterogeneity of these endogenous complexes and their reduction in the transfected samples is likely due to the known alternative splicing of nfi proteins and the ability of nfi proteins to form both homo- and hetero-dimers in vivo, respectively. specific binding was confirmed with an anti-ha supershift experiment .

in competition experiments, the l oligonucleotide was more effective than the n oligonucleotide , implicating a higher affinity of nfi-a to the site in the l <dig> gene as compared to the idealized consensus site. the point-mutated oligonucleotides lc and nc were unable to compete with the intact binding motifs. we conclude that, in vitro, nfi-a binds to its recognition site in the first intron of the mouse l <dig> gene, and that this interaction is tight and specific.

the brain-specific isoform of nfi-a binds to the regulatory region of the mouse l <dig> gene in vivo
to ask whether the interaction between nfi-a and its binding motif in the mouse l <dig> gene regulatory region is seen in vivo, we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation  analysis. mouse neuroblastoma  cells, which express endogenous l <dig>  <cit> , were transfected with myc-tagged nfi-a bs or myc-tagged nfi-a st, respectively. precipitation was carried out with an anti-myc antibody, and pcr primers were chosen which specifically amplify the region of the l <dig> gene flanking the nfi full binding site . fig. 5a  shows the outcome of a representative experiment: whereas binding of the brain-specific nfi-a isoform  to the l <dig> regulatory region could be confirmed, no signal was obtained for the ubiquitous isoform . the same result was observed in two further chip assays, and only in one experiment, weak binding of nfi-a st was detected. only weak pcr signals were observed for mock-transfected cells. as an additional negative control, segments of the mouse chst <dig> and chst <dig> genes were amplified by pcr. no signals were observed when chip precipitates were used as a template , confirming the specificity of nfi-a bs binding to the mouse l <dig> gene. western blot analysis revealed the presence of comparable amounts of both nfi-a isoforms in transfected n2a cells . thus, the brain-specific isoform of nfi-a directly interacts with the endogenous l <dig> gene regulatory region in a neuronal cell line.

nfi-a represses activity of the l <dig> gene in mouse neuroblastoma cells
for a functional analysis, the effect of forced nfi-a bs expression on the activity of a previously described l1-luciferase reporter construct, l1- <dig>  <cit> , was determined in n2a cells. the brain-specific isoform of nfi-a was chosen because it reproducibly bound to the endogenous l <dig> regulatory region , whereas in vivo binding of the ubiquitous nfi-a isoform appeared to be weaker. nfi-a bs reduced l <dig> gene activity to less than one-third of control values . repression was concentration-dependent, suggesting a specific effect . moreover, we investigated a mutated form of nfi-a bs , which lacked the entire activation/repression domain. nfi-a bs del should therefore be able to bind to dna, but exhibit a severely reduced ability to activate or repress target genes  <cit> . in line with these expectations, expression of the truncated nfi-a bs led to only a slight reduction of l <dig> transcription . summarizing, our data show a repressive influence of nfi-a bs on l <dig> gene expression, which can be reverted by impairing nfi-a's trans-regulatory abilities.

discussion
the cell adhesion molecule l <dig> plays a crucial role in mammalian nervous system development, but regulation of its expression at the transcriptional level is only partly understood. here, using emsa and antibody supershift experiments, we showed that the site-specific transcription factor nfi-a specifically interacts with a full nfi recognition site in the first intron of the murine l <dig> gene. the interaction is very strong, as shown by competition analysis. this high affinity is in accordance with a previous in vitro study, in which the nfi consensus binding motif was determined by pcr-mediated random site selection  <cit> . we also observed an electrophoretic mobility shift using extracts from cells not transfected with nfi-a expression plasmids, probably caused by expression of endogenous nfi proteins. the respective bands were much weaker when nfi-a was overexpressed, either due to a limiting input or due to a down-regulation of endogenous nfi-a by forced nfi-a expression.

chip analysis confirmed that the brain-specific isoform of nfi-a  binds to the regulatory region of the mouse l <dig> gene in vivo as well. by contrast, we did not observe reproducible binding of the ubiquitous nfi-a isoform  to this genomic region in vivo, although the in vitro interaction of nfi-a st with the full binding site in l <dig> was at least as strong as the one of nfi-a bs. this difference might be caused by the different binding reaction conditions in the two assays. alternatively, post-translational modifications could be a reason for the different behavior of nfi-a st and nfi-a bs in the two assays, in particular phosphorylation, which has been implied in regulating nfi activity by several studies  <cit> . whereas for emsa, extracts from cho cells were used, chip was performed using n2a cells. it is thus tempting to speculate that phosphorylation of crucial amino acid residues differs between nfi-a bs and nfi-a st in n2a cells, causing a different affinity to the l <dig> gene regulatory region. differences in protein phosphorylation or other modifications might also explain why the apparent molecular weights of nfi-a bs and nfi-a st differed slightly more than one would expect from their amino acid composition. finally, it should be noted that eight half binding sites for nfi proteins can be found in the  <dig> bp immediately upstream of the full site. nfi-a binds to such pentanucleotide sequences with a reduced affinity  <cit> .

in order to understand how binding of nfi-a to the l <dig> regulatory region influences l <dig> expression, we performed reporter gene assays in mouse neuroblastoma  cells. nfi-a bs caused a reduction in l <dig> gene activity to approx. 30% of control level. in this context, it is noteworthy that only the brain-specific isoform significantly interacted with the endogenous l <dig> gene regulatory region. moreover, we could nearly abolish repression of l <dig> transcription by nfi-a bs by deleting nfi-a's transregulatory domain. to our knowledge, these results are the first experimental evidence for a specific role of nfi-a bs in the regulation of a neuronal gene.

how could nfi-a activity at the l <dig> gene regulatory region be regulated in a physiological context? several studies suggest that nfi activity is modulated by nfi phosphorylation  <cit> . in our case, nfi-a could be inactivated by phosphorylation, leading to enhanced l <dig> expression. however, there is no direct evidence that phosphorylation affects nfi activity.

interactions with other site-specific transcription factors might also regulate transactivation/transrepression by nfi-a. nfi proteins physically interact with ttf- <dig>  <cit> , oct- <dig>  <cit> , ski  <cit> , and cbp  <cit> . binding of nfi-a to such factors could alter its inhibitory influence on l <dig> transcription initiation. remarkably, the hpd element, which is responsible for stimulation of l <dig> expression by pax- <dig>  is located in the same part of the l <dig> gene as the full nfi binding site identified in our study  <cit> . in addition, binding of the homeodomain proteins barx- <dig>  <cit>  and hoxa- <dig>  <cit>  to the l <dig> gene is also mediated by the hpd element. this might implicate a functional interaction between nfi transcription factors and pax- <dig>  barx- <dig>  or hoxa- <dig> in regulating l <dig> expression.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our data suggest that nfi-a is a repressor of mouse l <dig> gene activity. a role for nfi-a in regulating l <dig> expression during development is plausible, as expression of both genes starts around embryonic day  <dig> in the developing nervous system of the mouse  <cit> . in addition, kallunki et al.  <cit>  have proposed a second silencer element in the first intron of the l <dig> gene that functions together with the nrse to regulate l <dig> expression. nfi-a, binding tightly to its recognition motifs in this intron and repressing l <dig> expression, could be part of the proposed silencer. it may prevent l <dig> expression at inappropriate stages or cell types, like glia of the central nervous system, consistent with the recently demonstrated importance of nfi-a for glial cell differentiation  <cit> . as both l <dig> and nfi-a are crucial for brain development in humans  <cit> , further investigations on regulation of l <dig> expression by nfi-a, for instance cell type-specific analyses of nfi-a deficient mice during development, are likely to significantly extend our knowledge of human brain formation.
