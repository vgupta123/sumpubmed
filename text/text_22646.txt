BACKGROUND
plants are exposed to widely varying environmental conditions and because of their sessile nature they can only survive and thrive by adapting to the changes in their surroundings. thus, higher plants have the ability to adapt to periods of stress by employing specific responses underpinned by defined modifications of their cellular processes. phospholipase d  plays an important role in the regulation of diverse cellular processes in plants, including abscisic acid signaling, programmed cell death, root hair patterning, root growth, freezing tolerance and other stress responses  <cit> . pld hydrolyzes phospholipids into a head group alcohol and phosphatidic acid , which is an important intracellular messenger in plants, microorganisms and mammals  <cit> .

the gene encoding pld was first identified in plants more than  <dig> years ago  <cit> , but did not receive detailed attention until the 1980s  <cit> . multiple pld genes encoding isoforms that could be classified into different subgroups with distinct biochemical, regulatory and catalytic properties have now been identified. six arabidopsis plds  have been characterized molecularly and biochemically and can be differentiated depending on their requirements and/or affinities for ca2+, phosphatidylinositol  <dig> -bisphosphate  and free fatty acids  <cit> . the predominant isoenzyme is the α-type pld, which can be detected in both the leaves and seeds of plants and is responsible for the majority of the baseline pld activity found therein. pldα does not require phosphoinositides for its activity when assayed in the presence of mm levels of ca2+ ions. it exhibits optimum activity at ph values between  <dig> and  <dig> and at high, non-physiological ca2+ concentrations between  <dig> and  <dig> mm  <cit> . in contrast, the β, γ, δ and ε pld isoenzymes from arabidopsis show their highest activity at μm ca2+ concentrations and require the presence of pip <dig> to be fully active  <cit> . the activity of plant pldζ appears to occur independently of ca2+ ions, but requires pip <dig> to selectively hydrolyze phosphatidylcholine. in rice, an additional isoenzyme, pldφ, has been identified but poorly characterized as of yet  <cit> . the pld gene family encodes proteins with a number of cellular functions. for example, it has been suggested that pldβ is involved in the regulation of seed germination and may act as a negative regulator of defence responses and disease resistance in rice  <cit> , whereas pldδ has been shown to play an important role in drought-induced hydrogen peroxide synthesis, responses to freezing and uv irradiation, and in the reorganization of microtubules at plasma membrane  <cit> .

despite these apparent differences in their biochemical functions, all the eukaryotic plds share the presence of an n-terminal phospholipid-binding region and two highly conserved c-terminal domains where two catalytic hxkxxxxd  motifs interact to promote the lipase activity  <cit> . the plant pld family can also be divided into two further subfamilies  based on the composition of their n-terminal phospholipid-binding domains. the c2-pld subfamily comprises plds containing a c <dig> domain in their n-termini, while the n-termini of those of the pxph-pld subfamily contain both a phox homology  domain and a pleckstrin homology  domain. the c <dig>  px and ph domains have been implicated in protein-protein interactions, but perhaps their best described function involves their ability to modulate membrane targeting of proteins. the c <dig> domain of the c2-plds mediates the localization of soluble proteins to membranes by binding phospholipids in a ca2+ dependent manner  <cit> , while the px and ph domains of the pxph-plds have been shown to mediate membrane targeting and are closely linked to polyphosphoinositide signalling  <cit> . the c2-plds only exist in plants, whereas the pxph-plds exist both in plants and other organisms such as caenorhabditis elegans and homo sapiens. presumably, the genes encoding the c2-plds and their progenitors have been lost from the evolutionary lineages leading to animals and fungi  <cit> . furthermore, one additional small pld subfamily  exists in which members comprise plds possessing an n-terminal signal peptide in place of the usual c <dig> or pxph domains and the resulting specific cellular localizations may relate to their particular physiological functions in modulating plant growth, development and defence  <cit> . the isoforms α, β, γ, δ, and ε are c2-plds, the ζ isoform is a pxph-plds and the φ isoform is a sp-plds.

the pld gene family had been well studied in arabidopsis and rice. however, there is far less information about this family for woody plant species such as poplar and grape. the recent provision of draft genome sequences for poplar and grape offered the opportunity to investigate the pld gene family in these species. in this study, we first identified the pld gene family members in poplar and grape and then performed detailed evolutionary analyses of these identified genes in comparison with those existing in arabidopsis and rice.

RESULTS
pld gene family in poplar and grape
in order to identify members of the pld gene family in poplar and grape, the corresponding sequence information from arabidopsis was used to perform multiple searches of the relevant dna databases using the blast and tblastn algorithms, keyword searches and protein domain searches. the poplar and grape sequences returned by such searches were confirmed as encoding plds by using the programs pfam and smart. following this strategy, we identified  <dig> genes encoding plds in poplar   and  <dig> pld genes in grape . these numbers where similar to the number of pld genes present in the rice  and arabidopsis  genomes. since there was no standard annotation assigned to these newly identified genes, we assigned each of them an identity based on the order of their location on each of either the poplar or grape chromosomes.

*pseudogene

based on the presence of c <dig>  px and ph motifs within their n-terminal domains, all the pld family members in poplar and grape were assigned to two main subgroups, c2-plds and pxph-plds. additionally, one gene encoding an sp-pld with an n-terminal signal peptide replacing the c <dig>  px and ph domains was identified for each of these species. corresponding sp-pld genes were also found in other species, including caenorhabditis elegans , dictyostelium discoideum , homo sapiens  and rice .

chromosomal location of pld genes on poplar and grape genomes
chromosomal location analyses showed that pld genes of poplar and grape were dispersed throughout the respective genomes. five poplar pld genes were localized to unassembled genomic sequence scaffolds and thus were not mapped to any particular chromosome. in poplar, chromosomes i, ii, vi and xviii were found to possess two pld genes each, and each of chromosomes iii, v, x, xiii and xiv to possess a single pld gene . for grape,  <dig> pld genes were found to be present on  <dig> of the  <dig> chromosomes; chromosomes ii, v, xii, xv and xviii were all found to possess one pld gene each, whereas chromosome iv, ix and xi possessed two pld genes each .

phylogenetic relationships of pld gene family in poplar and grape
in order to classify the pld genes identified for poplar and grape and investigate their evolutionary relationships, their derived protein sequences and those of arabidopsis and rice  <cit>  were subjected to phylogenetic analyses. one rice pld gene, ospldκ , was excluded from the analysis since it appeared to encode a protein missing one hkd domain at its c-terminus, indicating that this gene may be a pseudogene or constitute either a sequencing or assembly error. after excluding other cases of such pseudogenes or incorrectly assembled genes, a total of  <dig> pld genes were used in the analyses,  <dig> from poplar ,  <dig> from grape,  <dig> from arabidopsis and  <dig> from rice  <cit>  . a phylogenetic tree based on protein sequences was constructed using the neighbor-joining  method with p-distance and complete deletion option. for statistical reliability, we conducted bootstrap analysis with  <dig> replicates. the nj phylogenetic tree showed that all the pld genes from the four higher plants divided into  <dig> well-supported clades . among these, the previously classified β and γ isoforms clustered closely together and were not explicitly separated from each other. accordingly, the tree clades were classified into six subgroups, α, β/γ, δ, ε, ζ and φ . among these, the α subgroup constituted the largest clade containing  <dig> members, and the β/γ subgroup formed the second largest clade containing  <dig> members . additionally, the β/γ and δ subgroups further clustered forming a larger clade and implying that they originated from a common ancestor by frequent gene duplication. among these subgroups, the α, β/γ, δ, ε comprised c2-plds while the ζ and φ subgroups comprised pxph-plds and sp-plds. interestingly, although phylogenetically members of the ε subgroup comprised c2-plds, they appeared somewhat divergent from this class of plds and were indeed intermediary between the c2-plds and pxph-plds. distinct from the other c2-plds, pldε appeared to possess the c <dig> structural fold, but this contained none of the acidic amino acid residues thought to be involved in ca2+ binding, suggesting that the phospholipid binding of pldε is less ca2+-dependent than the other c2-plds  <cit> . this feature of the pldε c <dig> domain appeared to be conserved between poplar, grape and arabidopsis. surprisingly, pldε does not appear to exist in rice.

structural analyses can provide valuable information concerning duplication events when interpreting phylogenetic relationships within gene families. thus, the exon/intron structure of each member of the pld family was analyzed . the number of exons determined for members of the pld gene family ranged from  <dig> in ospldα <dig> to  <dig> in ptpld <dig>  most members within the individual subgroups shared similar intron/exon numbers and predicted coding sequence  lengths, consistent with the phylogenetic classification of the plds into the subgroups depicted in the left panel of figure  <dig>  for example, both β/γ and δ subgroups included members with 9- <dig> exons with cds lengths of between  <dig> to  <dig> codons, consistent with the observation that they originated by continuous gene duplication. interestingly, the genes vvpld <dig> and vvpld <dig> appeared longer than the other members of the β/γ and δ subgroups because of the presence of a single long intron that contained repeated retrotransposon elements  <cit> . similarly, members of the α and ε subgroups possessed 3- <dig> exons, with some introns extended by retrotransposon elements, suggesting that they also had a common ancestor. members of the ζ subgroup which comprised pxph-plds, were distinct from the c2-plds clade in that they possessed between  <dig> to  <dig> exons , suggesting an independent evolutionary lineage. similarly, all members of the pxph-pld φ subgroup had  <dig> exons, also implying they originated via an evolutionary path separate to that of the c2-plds. thus, the phylogenetic and gene structure analysis suggested that the  <dig> pld subgroups originated from  <dig> ancestors via a series of gene duplications.

pld genes from each of the subgroups were found in all four species of the higher plants examined with the exception of members of the two small subgroups, ε and φ, which were absent in the rice and arabidopsis genomes, respectively. presumably, the main subgroups of the plant pld gene family were established before the dicot-monocot lineage parted and before further division of the dicotyledonous non-woody and woody herbaceous lineage. the majority of the pld genes from poplar  and grape  clustered more closely together in the phylogenetic tree than they did with those from arabidopsis and rice , suggesting that two woody plants had a closer evolutionary relationship than with the non-woody herbaceous dicot and the monocot  <cit> . five pairs of poplar pld genes  formed  <dig> well-supported subclusters  , indicating that they were evolutionarily very closely related. each pair of genes in each of the  <dig> subclusters had very similar structures , indicating that they originated from relatively recent gene duplications. four of these five subclusters also clustered relatively closely with a similar grape pld gene. at least one pair of grape pld genes  clustered sufficiently closely to suggest that they too arose from a recent duplication event. this grape subcluster also clustered closely with a pld gene from poplar. collectively, these results indicate that frequent gene duplications occurred following the divergence of the poplar and grape species and that in poplar this resulted in a rapid expansion of the size of the pld gene family.

evolutionary patterns of pld gene family in arabidopsis, rice, poplar and grape
segmental duplication, tandem duplication and transposition events such as retroposition and replicative transposition are the main reasons for gene family expansion  <cit> . two tandem pld gene duplications have previously been identified in arabidopsis  and rice   <cit> . chromosomal location analyses of the pld gene family in polar and grape showed that the majority of the genes appeared randomly scattered throughout the genome with the exception of one pair of grape pld genes  which were tightly co-located and thus most likely resulted from a tandem duplication . this suggests that tandem duplication is not a major contributory event leading to the expansion of the pld gene family in higher plants. thus, we hypothesized that, at least in arabidopsis, rice, poplar and grape, segmental duplication and transposition events may have played a more leading role in the evolution of the pld gene family.

to validate this hypothesis, we first selected  <dig> paralogous pld gene pairs from the phylogenetic tree  and subsequently explored the degree to which the protein-coding genes flanking each paralogous pair were similar. there were  <dig> pairs of paralogous pld genes identified in the phylogenetic tree for poplar . the identities of the genes flanking both sides of all  <dig> pairs of the paralogous poplar pld genes were found to be highly conserved , suggesting that all of the paralogous pld genes in poplar arose from segmental duplication events. similarly, in rice the protein-coding genes flanking each of the three pairs of pld paralogous genes identified  were found to be conserved . to better explore the mechanisms of the pld gene family expansion in grape, a phylogenetic analysis of only grape pld genes was used to identify paralogous gene pairs . two additional gene pairs  were thus identified and protein-coding gene identity was found to be highly conserved in the regions flanking the genes vvpld <dig> and vvpld <dig>  similarly, in arabidopsis one pld gene pair  with conserved protein-coding genes in their flanking regions was identified .

taken together, these findings indicate that the mechanisms underlying the gene duplications that have contributed to the expansion of the pld gene family differ between the four higher plants examined. in poplar, segmental duplication accounted for the majority of the gene duplications identified. in evolutionary terms, most of these poplar pld gene duplications appeared to have occurred relatively recently and may be associated with novel functional divergence and adaptation. however, in arabidopsis, rice and grape, both segmental duplication and transposition events appear to have contributed to the duplication of the pld genes. it is worth noting that some  <dig> % of the grape genome is composed of repetitive/transposable elements  <cit> . thus, it is prudent to propose that transposition events could have been an important factor governing the expansion of pld gene family in this species.

to estimate the evolutionary dates of the segmental duplication events, ks was used as the proxy for time and the conserved protein-coding genes flanking the pld gene pairs were thus subjected to ks calculation . the protein-coding genes flanking the  <dig> pairs of duplicated genes in poplar had very consistent mean ks values , suggesting that the segmental duplication events in this species occurred within the last  <dig>  to  <dig>  million years. this time period is subsequent to the time at which the evolutionary lineage of poplar and arabidopsis divided, circa 100- <dig> million years ago , and is consistent with the time  when a recent large scale genome duplication event is thought to have occurred in poplar  <cit> . the implication is that, relative to other species, the rapid expansion of the pld gene family in poplar resulted from higher order genome level processes.

the pld gene segmental duplication in grape was estimated to have occurred about  <dig>  ma , which is similar to when this was observed in poplar. the observation that there are fewer pld genes in grape compared to poplar may be due to the fact that grape experienced two genome wide duplication  events during evolution compared to three in poplar  <cit> .

for rice, the segmental duplication event was estimated to have occurred between  <dig>  to  <dig>  ma, which is subsequent to the time of divergence of the monocots and eudicots , but precedent to the time of the origin of the grasses   <cit> . the earliest observed segmental duplication event occurred in the pld genes of arabidopsis around  <dig>  ma. it is interesting, therefore, that despite similar levels of gwd, arabidopsis has comparably fewer pld genes than poplar. it is likely that this may due to the fact that the arabidopsis genome has subsequently suffered a high level of gene loss  <cit> .

functional divergence and driving forces for genetic divergence
site-specific shift rates  reflect the difference in the evolutionary rate of change of specific amino acid sites in proteins following gene duplication  <cit> . in order to detect the type-i functional divergence occurring in the plds, we determined the differences in the site-specific evolutionary rates of amino acid changes between the c2-pld and pxph-pld clades  using the program diverge. the results showed a significant evidence of type i functional divergence between the c2-plds and pxph-plds . when the threshold values of posterior probability  were set to either  <dig>  or  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> amino acid sites, respectively, were determined to be associated with the functional divergence of the c2- and pxph-plds .

positive darwinian selection has been reported to be associated with gene duplication and functional divergence. to explore whether positive selection drove evolution of the pld gene family, the coding regions of thirteen pld gene paralogs from arabidopsis, rice, poplar and grape were subjected to sliding window analyses. the nonsynonymous /synonymous substitution  ratio  is generally used to identify positive selection. a dn/ds  ratio > <dig>  < <dig> and =  <dig> indicates positive, negative, or purifying selection, and neutral evolution, respectively  <cit> . we calculated the dn/ds ratios for all the paralogs depicted in the phylogenetic tree reported in figure  <dig> with a sliding window of  <dig> bp and a moving step of  <dig> bp. the resulting pairwise comparison data showed that all the paralogous genes have dn/ds ratios of < <dig> except for the comparisons ospldα <dig> vs. ospldα <dig> and ospldβ <dig> vs. ospldβ <dig> , strongly suggesting that the pld gene family had mainly experienced strong purifying selection pressure. here, the action of such purifying selection on the duplicated poplar pld genes supports the observation that the rapid expansion of the pld family in this species resulted from higher order genome level processes. the gene pair, ospldα <dig> and ospldα <dig>  clustered closely together  and exhibited very similar exon/intron structures , suggesting that they were derived from relatively recent gene duplication event. the gene pair ospldβ <dig> and ospldβ <dig> also appeared to be similarly derived. pairwise comparisons between ospldα <dig> and ospldα <dig> and between ospldβ <dig> and ospldβ <dig> exhibited ω values > <dig> in some regions, especially in the n termini of the proteins , suggesting that a more recent episode of positive selection has occurred after the gene duplication event.

to further investigate the evolutionary selection pressures acting on the plds, a site-specific model was formulated using the codeml program of paml  <dig>   <cit>  with sequences from the c2-, pxph- and sp-pld clades. consistent with the pairwise comparison results, when using the robust codon-substitution model in paml, purifying selection was also determined to have acted on the c2-plds . such a selection pressure may indicate that strong functional constraints have a bearing on the evolution of the c2-plds, supporting the notion that this group of the plds have important and essential roles in the regulation of plant cellular processes. conversely, the concept that purifying selection is the main evolutionary mode of amino acid change in the c2-plds, along with the fact that the majority  of duplicated pld genes belong to this clade, implies that c2-pld gene duplication is unlikely to be associated with the formation of plds of either novel or divergent function.

in contrast, positive selection was observed to have occurred during the evolution of the pxph-plds and sp-plds. weak  and strong  positive selections were determined to have acted on the pxph-plds and sp-plds, respectively. although not reaching significant levels , one  and  <dig>  positively selected amino acid sites were identified in the pxph- and sp-plds, respectively .

plants possess relatively few pxph- and sp-pld genes in comparison to the numbers of c2-pld genes found in their genomes . thus, the positive selection that has acted on the pxph- and sp-pld genes may imply that their functional diversification has resulted from the need to adapt to a changing environment.

domains and motifs analyses in pld gene family
the proteins encoded by the newly identified poplar and grape pld genes were subjected to protein domain analyses. the program hmmpfam in hmmer  <cit>  was used initially to identify the major domains of the pld proteins. such domain analyses for arabidopsis and rice plds has been previously performed  <cit> . here, the analyses showed that the all the plds in poplar and grape possessed the two characteristic and structurally conserved hkd domains essential for their lipase activity. as in the case of arabidopsis and rice, the poplar and grape plds could be classified into the three subgroups , based on the presence of the subgroup-specific domains . as expected, in their n-terminal regions the c2-plds contained one c <dig> domain while the pxph-plds contained both px and ph domains and an n-terminal signal peptide was identified in each of the sp-plds .

such domain search tools are suitable for defining the presence or absence of roughly recognisable domains, but they are unable to recognize either smaller individual motifs or more divergent patterns. thus, we used the motif search tool meme/mast to mine for more detailed motif information  in the plds of the four higher plants examined. the thirty motifs identified by meme were annotated by interproscan  <cit> . the result showed that, except for motifs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the majority of these domains were functionally associated with pld activity . for analytical convenience, we divided the data into parts covering three regions of the plds: the n-terminal region before the first hkd domain, the middle region including the region in and between the two hkd domains, and the c-terminal region after the second hkd domain .

the n-terminal region of the c2-plds contained  <dig> motifs, compared with  <dig> motifs in the same region of the pxph-plds . four motifs found in the n-termini of the c2-plds  appeared specific to this pld clade  and have been suggested to take part in the formation of an eight βstrand switch involved in ca2+-binding  <cit> . motifs  <dig> and  <dig> appeared to be specific to the px domain and motif  <dig> to the ph domain of the pxph-plds , and are thought to be associated with the binding of phosphatidylinositol lipids  <cit> . one observed exception was atpldγ <dig> that contained an additional motif,  <dig>  in the c <dig> domain. additionally, in ospldα <dig>  ptpld <dig>  ptpld <dig>  vvpld <dig>  atpldα <dig>  atpldε and atpldγ <dig> the c <dig> domain appeared to have lost either one or two of the four motifs mentioned above that are associated with the binding of ca2+ . the n-terminal region of the c2-plds, the region behind c <dig> domain  usually included the  <dig> motifs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  a degree of loss of some of these motifs was observed in some of the c2-plds from each of the four species examined. for example, atpldε, vvpld <dig>  vvpld <dig>  ptpld <dig>  ptpld <dig>  ptpld <dig>  ptpld <dig> and ospldα <dig> appear to have lost either one or both of motifs  <dig> and  <dig> . in contrast, no motif loss was observed in the pxph-plds, possibly due to the small number of members of this subgroup and the relatively small number of motifs in the n-terminal region of these plds. both the c2-plds and pxph-plds shared two conserved motifs,  <dig> and  <dig>  implying a crucial role for these in pld function.

the middle region of the plds contained  <dig> and  <dig> motifs in the c2-plds and pxph-plds, respectively. there appeared to be a relatively higher level of conservation in this region between the c2-plds and pxph-plds as they shared  <dig> motifs . the middle region of the c2-plds and pxph-plds started from the c-terminal ends of motifs  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, and ended with motif  <dig> that formed the hkd <dig> domain. the c-terminal sequences of motifs  <dig> and  <dig> are identical and, together with motif  <dig>  formed the hkd <dig> domain . thus, these two sections of the middle region appeared identical in both the c2-plds and pxph-plds . comparative sequence alignment of the two hkd domains revealed that the hkd <dig> domain sequence was relatively more diverse than that of the hkd <dig> domain . both the hkd <dig> and hkd <dig> domains contained three highly conserved amino acids , implying that these have a key functional importance within these domains. it would appear that the two hkd domains have co-evolved within the pld family. phylogenetic analysis of the hkd <dig> and hkd <dig> domains, respectively, produced two trees that exhibited similar topology  to that revealed by the same analysis of the pld gene family. the hkd domain trees clustered similarly into  <dig> subgroups, with gene members clustering in an almost identical fashion to that observed when the full length plds were so analysed.

three other motifs  in the middle region were also shared by both the c2-plds and pxph-plds. motif  <dig> contained a regular-expression sequence "gprpwhdhgpadvltnferwrkgglvk"  which is thought to form the binding site of pip <dig>  variations in the sequence of this motif exhibit different pip <dig> binding affinity  <cit> . sequence alignment of motif  <dig> from the individual plds showed that  <dig> %  of the amino acid sites were highly conserved with  <dig> of them being fully conserved, suggesting that they may play an essential role in the binding of both c2-plds and pxph-plds to pip <dig> . motif  <dig> contained a regular-expression sequence "iyienqf" . the seventh amino acid of this regular-expression sequence, phe , appeared in all pxph-plds, but was often substituted by tyr  in the c2-plds . this short sequence was only found in the pld family members, and has been postulated to increase the rate of catalysis and ensure substrate specificity  <cit> . this suggests that the sequence "iyienqf" may be almost as critical as the hkd motif for pld activity  <cit> . in addition, motif  <dig> was also found in both the c2-plds and pxph-plds . four amino acid sites in this motif were shown to be highly conserved, especially the eighth amino acid, tyrosine, which was fully conserved. with the exception of these four conserved amino acid sites, the remainder of motif  <dig> exhibited a high degree of sequence polymorphism.

apart from these shared motifs, the c2-plds and pxph-plds possessed a number of clade-specific motifs within their middle regions. the c2-plds had  <dig> such motifs  and the pxph-plds one motif,  <dig> . the c2-pld-specific motif  <dig> contained a core triplet of amino acids, "erf", followed by a highly conserved hydrophobic region, "vyvvv" . in atpldα <dig>  this motif was reported as being able to bind to the gα subunit of the arabidopsis heterotrimeric g protein  <cit> . when the sequences of motif  <dig> from the different c2-plds were aligned, the erf triplet appeared to be relatively more conserved than the "vyvvv" region. however, mutations that have occurred in ospldα <dig>  atpldγ <dig>  and ospldδ <dig> changed the second residue of the erf triplet from the basic amino acid r into the non-charged amino acids s, n and q, respectively, implying a possible change in the ability of these plds to bind to the heterotrimeric g protein gα subunit  <cit> .

in the c-terminal region, the c2-plds contained  <dig> motifs  and the pxph-plds  <dig> motifs  , thus sharing the single motif  <dig> 

overall,  <dig> motifs  were shown to be shared by both the c2- and pxph-plds subgroups, implying that they are likely to be necessary for pld function. the majority of these conserved motifs appeared to exist in the middle region of the plds, strongly suggesting that the two hkd domains in this region play a key role in the lipase activity of the plds.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have provided a genome-wide identification and analysis of the pld gene family in poplar and grape. eighteen and  <dig> members of the pld gene family were identified in poplar and grape, respectively. phylogenetic and gene structure analyses showed that the pld gene family can be divided into  <dig> subgroups  and that these  <dig> pld subgroups originated from  <dig> original ancestors through a series of gene duplications. phylogenetically, the majority of the pld genes from poplar  and grape  clustered particularly closely, suggesting a close evolutionary relationship between these two species. five pairs of duplicated pld genes were identified in poplar, more than those identified in grape, suggesting that frequent gene duplication occurred after the species diverged resulting in a rapid expansion of the pld gene family in poplar. the majority of gene duplications in poplar appeared to have been caused by segmental duplication, distinguishing it from the other three plant species, arabidopsis, rice and grape, where both segmental duplication and transposition events appeared to have contributed to the duplication of the pld genes. furthermore, the pld gene duplications in poplar were estimated to have occurred between  <dig>  to  <dig>  ma, substantially later than the time when duplications occurred in the other three plant species . adaptive evolution analysis showed that purifying selection has driven evolution of the c2-plds, whereas positive selection has contributed, at least in part, to the evolution of the remaining plds, especially after gene duplication.

the pld gene family is divided into two main subfamilies, c2-plds and pxph-plds, and one smaller subfamily, sp-plds. motif analyses show that the c2-plds and pxph-plds generally contain  <dig> and  <dig> motifs, respectively. among these,  <dig> motifs were shared by both the c2- and pxph-plds subfamilies, implying that they may be necessary for pld function. the majority of these shared motifs exist in the middle region of the plds, suggesting that the two hkd domains also play a core role in pld activity.

this detailed analysis of the pld gene family in these two woody plants has provided the data that will form the basis for future hypothesis-driven experiments involving either loss- or gain-of-function studies aimed at clarifying the role of the different plds in the growth, development and survival of poplar and grape. thus, this new knowledge of the pld gene family in these species may lead to the possibility of modulating pld gene expression and function in order to control specific aspects of the physiology and development of woody plants.
