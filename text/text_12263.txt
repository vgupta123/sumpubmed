BACKGROUND
a metabolic network represents the transition or transformation of chemical compounds, where enzymes are represented as edges, and chemical compounds are represented as vertices. with the recent developments of pathway database: kegg pathway  <cit> , much more information on chemical compounds and the roles of enzymes in biological systems has become available. in particular, many secondary metabolites found in plants are known to have roles in the defenses against pathogens, and have been attracting attention of researchers for more than a decade  <cit> . however, the organism-specific metabolic networks are not complete, and there are many "missing enzymes" whose existence are known but their functions are unknown. for identifying the characteristics of those missing enzymes, assignment of ec  numbers to the enzymatic reactions plays a key role, since the ec number represents a hierarchical categorization of enzymes with respect to the enzymatic reactions they catalyze. so one can assign ec numbers to enzymatic reactions based on the knowledge from similar reactions first, then look up candidate enzymes in the same ec category. the process of assigning ec numbers is done manually by the joint commission on biological nomenclature  of the international union of biochemistry and molecular biology  and the international union of pure and applied chemistry , however, this assignment process is so slow and many enzymes are still unannotated. for example, figure  <dig> shows a part of a terpenoid biosynthesis pathway, but there are many enzymes whose ec numbers are not yet assigned .

fulfilling such missing ec numbers on a pathway can be casted as a multi-class classification problem given a pair of substrate and product as an input and the corresponding ec number as an output. kotera et al. proposed an automatic ec number assignment system "e-zyme" for metabolic reactions  <cit> . yamanishi et al. recently reformed the engine of e-zyme by introducing multi-layered matching and weighted majority voting  <cit> . however, e-zyme is still based on the detection of maximum common subgraphs between chemical compounds, so the shift of a large chemical group is not correctly detected  <cit> . also, the e-zyme system is a rule-based method and does not allow approximate matching, which results in poor coverage. in many cases, e-zyme rejects a query because none of the rules matches  <cit> .

in this paper, we propose to represent a metabolic reaction as a reaction graph, where each vertex corresponds to a chemical compound, and an edge between two chemical compounds corresponds to their relationships in reaction. a reaction graph is a 'graph of graphs', because each node contains a graph representing a chemical compound. to evaluate the similarity of two reaction graphs, we use marginalized graph kernels  <cit>  in a recursive way. first, we compute graph kernels between every pair of chemical compounds and then use it as a node kernel for an upper-level graph kernel. in our experiment based on the kegg/reaction database, our reaction graph kernel in combination with kernel nearest neighbor showed 83% accuracy for classifying  <dig> reactions into  <dig> classes. furthermore, we exhaustively extracted missing enzymatic reactions in the plant's secondary metabolism in the kegg database. among the  <dig> reactions extracted, we could assign ec numbers to  <dig> reactions with the help of an expert from the kegg team. the performance of our method is compared with e-zyme on this external validation set. reaction graph kernel successfully assigned ec numbers to  <dig> ec classes,  <dig> ec subclasses and  <dig> ec subsubclasses. on the other hand, e-zyme could assign ec numbers to only  <dig> ec classes,  <dig> ec subclasses and  <dig> ec subsubclasses, due to its low coverage. the biochemical grounds for manual assignments are shown together with the individual prediction results of reaction graph kernels and e-zyme.

RESULTS
reaction graph and reaction graph kernel
an example of metabolic chemical reaction is represented by   

given such a chemical reaction, a task is to predict the ec number of the enzyme catalyzing the reaction. in this case, the enzyme is secologanin synthase , which turns a substrate  into a product  with nadph as a cofactor. however, if the information on the enzyme is not available, we need to look up the entries in the database whose reactions are similar to the reaction of interest. a reasonable similarity metric is a key to solving this problem.

as a canonical representation of chemical reactions, we propose to represent metabolic reactions as reaction graphs. a reaction graph consists of vertices, which are compounds in a reaction, and edges which denote the relationships between compounds. the edge labels are chosen from either 'main', 'leave', 'cofactor', 'transferase' or 'ligase' based on the categorization in the kegg/rpair database. we additionally introduced a 'group' edge which connects all the compounds on the substrate side of the reaction, and all the compounds on the product side of the reaction. an example of reaction graph corresponding to equation  is presented in figure  <dig> 

to evaluate the similarity between two reaction graphs, we use random walk kernels  <cit>  in a recursive way. we first compute all the pairwise similarities of the vertices  using random walk kernels. then the compound-wise similarities are used as the label matching probabilities for the upper-level graph kernel. the details of random walk kernels are described in the methods section.

leave-one-out prediction of missing ec numbers
in order to evaluate the reaction graph kernels, we collected metabolic reactions from the kegg/reaction database. following the pre-process used by  <cit> , we did not use reactions which  do not have ec numbers,  include chemical compounds whose structures are not available,  have classes  <dig> and  <dig>   have only one reaction in the same subsubclass. this pre-processing resulted in  <dig>   <dig> reactions in  <dig> classes,  <dig> subclasses, and  <dig> subsubclasses.

in this experiment, we withheld one reaction from the database, and predicted its ec number using all the other reaction-enzyme pairs. for the prediction, we used the nearest neighbor approach based on the reaction graph kernels. for the calculation of the reaction graph kernels, we used chemcpp  with the "non-tottering" option  <cit> . the random walk parameter of the lower-level and upper-level graph kernels were selected from { <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> }, respectively, and  <dig>  was used for both kernels, since it performed best in the experiments.

in reality, it is not often the case that the whole reaction graph of a query is known, so we considered degenerated settings, namely, rpair and main-pair. in the rpair setting, only reactant pairs are used, where the reactant pair information is obtained from kegg/rpair database figure  <dig>  in the main-pair setting, only main-pairs are used for prediction figure  <dig> 

the leave-one-out accuracy is reported in table  <dig>  in the table, we denote the degenerated settings as rpair and main-pair, and the non-degenerated setting as full-edge. clearly, predictions up to the second digit  and to the third digit  are more difficult. we did not test up to the fourth digit, since the last digit is often used just as a serial number  <cit> . we observed that additional edges in the reaction graphs help improve the classification performance. notice that rpair corresponds to the same setting as that of e-zyme, but the use of full-edge turned out to be strongly advantageous in discriminating small changes in similar lower class reactions. according to  <cit> , the e-zyme system has similar precision, as long as they provide an answer. however, its coverage is much lower than our method, as shown in the next subsection.

predicting ec numbers of unannotated reactions in plant's secondary metabolism
in order to further evaluate the proposed method, we performed a blind test, where we tested only reactions whose ec numbers are not yet assigned in the secondary metabolism of plants. first we collected metabolic reactions from the kegg "biosynthesis of secondary metabolites - reference pathway" data. from the resulting  <dig> reactions, we removed  <dig> reactions which are either non-enzymatic reactions or multi-step reactions whose systems are too complicated, based on an expert's judgement. then we tested the e-zyme and reaction graph kernels on the remaining  <dig> reactions.

e-zyme returned answers to only  <dig> queries, and the coverage was only  <dig> %. this is because e-zyme is a rule-based method, and can only match very similar reactions. reaction graph kernels allow approximate matching, and returned answers for all the  <dig> reactions. the performance on the blind test is reported both for e-zyme and reaction graph kernels in table  <dig>  reaction graph kernels could assign more number of correct ec numbers than e-zyme. however, e-zyme achieves slightly better accuracy. this is because e-zyme rejects queries which are too difficult to predict. it is worth noting that reaction graph kernels can also reject queries and achieves higher accuracy at the cost of coverage.

a list of newly annotated reactions is presented in additional file  <dig>  together with prediction results of e-zyme and reaction graph kernels . for reaction graph kernels, the z-score  is calculated so that one can find a candidate with a saliently higher score than others. the biochemical grounds for the manual assignment of the ec numbers are presented in the "comments" column. since the enzyme nomenclature and the scheme of ec number classification had been published  <cit> , we can infer the plausible ec numbers from given information of reaction formula. as can be seen in additional file  <dig>  some reactions progress in multiple steps and have several correct ec numbers. however, neither reaction graph kernels nor e-zyme considers such situations, which remains for future research.

CONCLUSIONS
we proposed an alternative method for assigning ec numbers to unknown enzymatic reactions based on reaction graph kernels which measure similarity between reaction graphs. on a blind test predicting missing ec numbers in plant secondary metabolism pathway, we demonstrated that reaction graph kernels collected more number of accurate potential ec numbers than e-zyme.
