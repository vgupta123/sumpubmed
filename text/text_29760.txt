BACKGROUND
the huperziaceae consist of two genera, huperzia and phlegmariurus, with a total of about 150species worldwide  <cit> . the huperziaceae grow very slowly, normally requiring fifteen to twenty years of growth from spore germination to maturity  <cit> . many studies have investigated the natural products in huperziaceae plants, including lycopodium alkaloids, triterpenes, flavones and phenolic acids, some of which possess pharmacological activities  <cit> . among these compounds, the lycopodium alkaloids, especially huperzine a , were originally isolated from huperzia serrata and have been investigated extensively and intensively  <cit> .

huperzia serrata  trev. is a member of the huperzia genus. phlegmariurus carinatus  ching, also known as club moss, is a member of the phlegmariurus genus  <cit> . h. serrata and p. carinatus are good candidate model plants for studying the biosynthetic pathways of lycopodium alkaloids since they accumulate various types of lycopodium alkaloids including lycopodines, lycodines and fawcettimines, some of which are valuable for pharmaceutical applications  <cit> . in particular, hup a, which belongs to the lycodines, has been used not only as an anti-alzheimer's disease  drug candidate in china due to its selective inhibition of acetylcholinesterase , but also as a dietary supplement in the usa  <cit> . whole h. serrata plants are the original source of hup a production. p. carinatus is commonly characterized as low, evergreen and coarsely moss-like, has a close taxonomic relationship with h. serrata and also produces hup a across the entire plant  <cit> . given their great health benefits and economic value, these plants are in danger of extinction in china due to extensive collection for hup a production  <cit> . to protect the huperziaceae from extinction and to support efforts to produce hup a, cultivation and in vitro propagation have been investigated  <cit> . however, the long-term and efficient protection of these plants will depend on research into the molecular mechanisms of lycopodium alkaloid biosynthesis and further research is required in that field so that hup a can be produced using biotechnological approaches.

several recent studies identified a type iii polyketide synthase  and its corresponding gene in h. serrata  <cit> . a proposed biosynthesis pathway for the synthesis of hup a and related lycopodium alkaloids consisting of pelletierine coupled with 4paa was reported by ma and gang   <cit>  based on previous studies  <cit> . initially, l-lysine is decarboxylated by lysine decarboxylase to form cadaverine. the subsequent reactions on the intermediates include a series of oxidations, decarboxylations and n-methylations that lead to the production of hup a and related lycopodium alkaloids  <cit> . cytochrome p450s are proposed to catalyze the oxidative modifications of the intermediates  <cit> . however, the complete biosynthetic pathways of these alkaloids  have yet to be elucidated. genomic and transcriptomic knowledge is currently restricted to ten h. serrata and three p. carinatus nucleotide sequences available in genbank . the limited genetic information available on these plants and our desire to identify genes involved in hup a biosynthesis led us to analyze the transcriptomes of h. serrata and p. carinatus. the goal of this study was to analyze and compare the transcriptomes of h. serrata and p. carinatus using high-throughput sequencing of expressed sequence tags  to discover functional genes, especially those involved in the biosynthesis of bioactive compounds and transcriptional regulation.

est analysis is a cost-effective and rapid tool for the isolation of genes. it provides a route for the identification of novel genes and it allows characterization of the transcriptome in various tissues  <cit> . ohlrogge and benning   <cit>  reviewed the discovery of genes involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites using est analysis. est sequencing has also been used to establish phylogenetic relationships and identify simple sequence repeat  analysis. est-ssrs have revealed polymorphisms not only within the source taxon, but in related taxa as well  <cit> . recently, a "next-generation" high-throughput sequencing method based on the roche  <dig> genome sequencer  flx platform has emerged as a cost-effective approach that is well adapted to the analysis of the transcriptomes of both model and non-model species  <cit> . not only can the  <dig> sequencing technology identify a large number of expressed sequences, but it can also discover new genes via deep sequencing, effectively revealing the expression of many rare transcripts.

this report describes a 454-est analysis of h. serrata and p. carinatus and discovers a large number of candidate transcripts that have significant sequence similarities to cytochrome p450s, methyltransferases and dioxygenases, all of which might be involved in lycopodium alkaloid biosynthesis in the huperziaceae plants. other genes involved in serratane  and flavonoid biosynthesis as well as hormone biosynthesis and signal transduction were also found. furthermore, ssrs were detected among the h. serrata and p. carinatus 454-est datasets. this 454-est analysis provides the first insight into the expressed genes of h. serrata and p. carinatus, the representative members of the huperziaceae family. potential genetic markers as well as sets of transcripts involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis  and transcriptional regulation were obtained.

RESULTS
454-est sequencing and assembly
we constructed two cdna libraries from a pool of mrna from the vegetative organs of h. serrata and p. carinatus using the smart technology. the two libraries were sequenced on a 454-gs flx titanium platform, a one-quarter plate run for h. serrata and a one-eighth plate run for p. carinatus. after initial quality filtering with the default parameters, these runs yielded a total of  <dig> mb from  <dig>  high-quality  sequence reads for h. serrata and  <dig> mb from  <dig>  hq sequence reads for p. carinatus . an overview of the sequencing and assembly processes is shown in table  <dig>  after removal of sequences shorter than  <dig> bp, a total of  <dig>   h. serrata and  <dig>   p. carinatus hq reads with average lengths of  <dig> ±  <dig> and  <dig> ±  <dig> bp, respectively, were used in the assembly . most of the reads were similar in length to the results from those studies  <cit>  and longer than those used in the previous 454-est studies  <cit> .

athe unique putative transcripts were annotated by blastx analysis against the ncbi nr database.

the length distribution for these reads is given in fig 1a, and it suggests that approximately 90% of the reads were between  <dig> and  <dig> bp in length. clustering and assembly using the gs de novo assembler software v <dig> . <dig>  led to the construction of  <dig>  and  <dig>  contigs from h. serrata and p. carinatus, respectively, with average lengths of  <dig> ±  <dig> and  <dig> ±  <dig> bp. among these,  <dig>   h. serrata and  <dig>   p. carinatus contigs with lengths longer than  <dig> bp were considered large contigs, the proportions of which were higher than the 8-27% reported in previous studies using  <dig> platforms  <cit> . the average depth of coverage for all h. serrata and p. carinatus contigs was  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold, respectively, which are lower than the coverage depths in previous studies  <cit> . the length distribution of the contigs from h. serrata and p. carinatus, summarized in fig 1b, demonstrates that the majority of contigs had lengths of  <dig> to  <dig>  bp. the relationship between the length of a given contig and the number of reads assembled into that contig was positive  <cit> . overall, these results indicate the potential for high-throughput sequencing based on the 454-gs flx titanium to improve sequencing efficiency in future transcriptome analyses. there were  <dig>  h. serrata and  <dig>  p. carinatus sequences considered to be singletons, with average lengths of  <dig> ±  <dig> and  <dig> ±  <dig> bp, respectively . in total,  <dig>  h. serrata and  <dig>  p. carinatus unique putative transcripts consisting of contigs and singletons were used for the annotation and subsequent analysis .

annotation of unique putative transcripts
the annotation approach was based on sequence similarity searches in databases. to detect any possible contaminating ribosomal rna sequences, all unique putative transcripts were subjected to a blastn search against the ncbi non-redundant nucleotide database, yielding  <dig>  h. serrata and  <dig>  p. carinatus well-identified sequences with e values ≤ 10- <dig>  these included only  <dig> and  <dig> ribosomal rna sequences from the h. serrata and p. carinatus 454-est datasets, respectively. to capture the most informative and complete annotations, all unique putative transcripts were first used in blastx searches against the swissprot database. approximately 20% of the unique putative transcripts  were thus annotated. then, all the unique putative transcripts were subjected to a blastx search against the ncbi non-redundant protein database, yielding  <dig>  and  <dig>  well-identified sequences from h. serrata and p. carinatus, respectively, with at least one hit with an e value ≤ 10- <dig> . altogether, only approximately 40% of the unique putative transcripts from h. serrata and p. carinatus showed significant sequence similarities to proteins in these databases, indicating that there is limited information about the genomes or transcriptomes of these ferns and their related species. in addition, this low proportion  of unique putative transcripts assigned annotations might be due to the following reasons:  some singletons might be junk sequences produced by  <dig> sequencing, leading to assembly difficulties and errors,  the advances of deep sequencing, which can discover novel genes with low expression levels,  the shortness of the sequence reads, resulting in inefficient annotation.

among the annotated unique putative transcripts, we found many transcripts that could be involved in the biosynthesis of lycopodium alkaloids and other types of bioactive compounds, including triterpenoids and flavonoids. these substantial 454-est datasets provide comprehensive information about the h. serrata and p. carinatus transcriptomes for the first time.

comparison between h. serrata and p. carinatus based on go and kegg assignments
gene ontology  assignments describe gene products in terms of their associated molecular functions, biological processes and cellular components. to assign putative functional roles to the unique putative transcripts from h. serrata and p. carinatus, we compared them to the arabidopsis proteome using blastx and used the go assignments of the arabidopsis proteome, producing assignments for  <dig>   h. serrata and  <dig>   p. carinatus sequences, respectively, matching  <dig>  and  <dig>  arabidopsis genes. the h. serrata and p. carinatus unique putative transcripts covered a similarly broad range of go categories . the go analysis identified well-represented categories within cellular components, including chloroplast, the plasma membrane and the nucleus. the sequences encoded a broad set of transcripts represented within the molecular function categories. the well-represented molecular function categories included transferase activity, hydrolase activity, nucleotide binding and transporter activity . the functions of the identified genes cover various biological processes. among these, other metabolic processes, protein metabolism, response to abiotic or biotic stimuli and transport were well-represented . three gene classes in biological processes  were overrepresented in the h. serrata library . the other ten gene classes were slightly more abundant in the p. carinatus library .

kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  analysis provides an alternative functional annotation of genes using enzyme commission  numbers for assignments based on the genes associated with biochemical pathways. overall,  <dig>  h. serrata and  <dig>  p. carinatus unique putative transcripts showed similarities to sequences in the kegg databases. of these sequences, only  <dig>  for h. serrata and  <dig>  for p. carinatus were assigned to biochemical pathways. the profiles of the genes from h. serrata and p. carinatus that were involved in biochemical pathways were similar . the kegg metabolic pathways were well-represented by  <dig>  h. serrata and  <dig> p. carinatus unique putative transcripts, most of which were related to amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, energy metabolism, lipid metabolism and the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites . these findings probably result from high levels of expression of essential housekeeping genes, causing them to be well-represented in an incomplete transcriptome sequencing effort. in particular, the biosynthetic pathways of several bioactive compounds were well-represented by  <dig> h. serrata and  <dig> p. carinatus unique putative transcripts in our 454-est datasets, totaling  <dig> h. serrata- and  <dig> p. carinatus-related ec numbers associated with the biosynthesis of alkaloids, flavones/flavonoids, phenylpropanoids, terpenoids and steroids . the kegg pathways of genetic information processing, protein families and cellular processes were well-represented by unique putative transcripts from h. serrata and p. carinatus 
. however, most of the unique putative transcripts  remained unassigned to any known biological pathway .

the distributions of gene functions and biochemical pathways  in the h. serrata and p. carinatus transcriptomes were similar, particularly in the categories of molecular function and metabolism. these annotations provide valuable resources for investigations of gene function, cellular structures and processes in these two species. the discovery of transcripts that might be involved in the biosynthesis of alkaloids, flavones/flavonoids, phenylpropanoids and terpenoids will facilitate the elucidation of bioactive compound biosynthetic mechanisms at the molecular level in the huperziaceae .

ssr detection and validation
microsatellites  have been used as a resource for random candidate markers in population genetics studies. to better understand the natural diversity of huperziaceae and to develop strategies for its sustainable utilization, we identified ssr motifs in our 454-est dataset. some of these est-ssrs were tightly linked with functional genes that may control certain agronomic characters, including bioactive compound biosynthesis. a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  putative ssr motifs from  <dig>   and  <dig>   ssr-containing unique putative transcripts were identified within the 454-ests of h. serrata and p. carinatus, respectively . the incidence of ssrs in the h. serrata  and p. carinatus  unique putative transcripts was lower than that in other plants such as apple   <cit> , but it was similar to that of some dicotyledonous species . the wide variation in the frequency of ssr motifs between different species results from the criteria used to identify ssrs during database mining  <cit>  as well as from considerable variation in the abundance of ssrs across taxa  <cit> . additionally, differences in the software used to detect ssrs might affect their frequency  <cit> . among the ssrs, dinucleotides  were the most abundant repeat units followed by trinucleotides , tetranucleotides , hexanucleotides  and pentanucleotides . the occurrence of ssrs in h. serrata and p. carinatus is different from their distribution in other organisms such as the medicinal plant e. sagittatum  <cit>  and cereal species  <cit> , where trinucleotide repeat units are the most dominant ssr, followed by di- and tetranucleotide repeat units  <cit> .

the relative frequency of repeats with different dinucleotide compositions was also biased towards one of four possible repeat classes in these two species . among the dinucleotide repeat classes, ag repeats were the most common dimer motif, followed by ac and at. cg repeats were very infrequent in these two plants. among the trinucleotide repeats, agc/cag/gca/tgc/ctg/gct was the largest repeat class followed by aag/gaa/aga/ctt/ttc/tct . the majority  of ssr-containing unique putative transcripts had a single ssr per sequence, while  <dig>  h. serrata and  <dig>  p. carinatus unique putative transcripts contained two or more ssrs per sequence. over 50%  of the ssrs were between  <dig> and  <dig> bp long . these unique putative transcript-derived ssr markers that were generated in the present study provide a valuable genetic resource for future studies of these two species and other related species.

twenty of the predicted ssr-containing sequences  from the h. serrata and p. carinatus 454-ests were selected for validation using pcr and sanger sequencing. a total of  <dig> sequences were amplified successfully including eight unique putative transcripts from h. serrata and eight from p. carinatus . among these, nine contig sequences from h. serrata and p. carinatus were amplified by pcr, and all of these were found to contain ssr motifs. by comparison, only seven singleton sequences were amplified, five of which contained ssrs . several singletons were not amplified successfully. the primers used to amplify these ssrs are listed in additional file  <dig>  because the transcripts selected for validation include several candidate genes encoding enzymes involved in bioactive compound biosynthesis, the ssrs confirmed in these analyses may be valuable for investigating the genetic determinants of biosynthesis gene expression. in summary, the successful experimental validation of the majority of the computationally predicted ssr motifs confirms the utility of mining 454-ests for genetic markers. the development of est-ssr markers in huperziaceae should greatly facilitate marker-assisted selection, germplasm breeding, adulterated species identification and genetic diversity studies in these cultivated medicinal species.

genes related to lycopodium alkaloid biosynthesis
both h. serrata and p. carinatus produce various types of lycopodium alkaloids, including hup a. in an initial attempt to discover candidate genes involved in lycopodium alkaloid biosynthesis, we constructed a cdna library from h. serrata leaves and used sanger sequencing to generate  <dig>  ests   <cit> . comparison of these hsests with the h. serrata 454-ests showed that all of the hsests were included in the 454-est dataset, reflecting the greater capacity of 454-ests for discovering genes.

lycopodium alkaloids originate from the coupling of the pelletierine and the 4paa/4paacoa pathways  <cit>  . in a first step, lysine decarboxylase decarboxylates l-lysine to form cadaverine. thus, lysine decarboxylase is proposed to be the first enzyme that participates in lycopodium alkaloid biosynthesis  <cit> . although investigations of this enzyme and its corresponding gene have not been performed in any huperziaceae plant, we obtained a full-length cdna sequence encoding this enzyme in a previous study  <cit> . unique putative transcripts encoding lysine decarboxylase were also present in our 454-est dataset . the subsequent reactions from malonyl-coa and Δ1- piperideine to pelletierine, the first general intermediate of lycopodium alkaloids, might be catalyzed by a diamine oxidase , a ketosynthase-type enzyme  or a decarboxylase   <cit>  . the second general intermediate of all lycopodium alkaloids is phlegmarine, which is formed from pelletierine and 4paa/4paacoa, involving also a decarboxylation step  <cit>  . the oxidative modifications of phlegmarine and lycodane are presumably catalyzed by cytochrome p <dig> or dioxygenase, and they produce a series of precursors of hup a  <cit>  . unique putative transcripts showing similarities to those of uncharacterized enzymes possibly associated with lycopodium alkaloid biosynthesis, including cytochrome p450-dependent monooxygenases , methyltransferases and dioxygenases, were found in the h. serrata and p. carinatus 454-est datasets . these candidate cyp450s presumably catalyze the oxidative modifications leading to the production of lycopodium alkaloids . of the unique putative transcripts,  <dig> h. serrata and  <dig> p. carinatus sequences were annotated as putative cyp450s belonging to various subfamilies .

in plants, cyp450s catalyze many different reactions involved in a wide range of biosynthetic pathways, including those leading to alkaloids, phenylpropanoids, hormones, terpenoids, sterols, lignins, fatty acids, pigments and the detoxification of herbicides  <cit> . although the results of several studies suggest progress in the isolation and characterization of cyp450s, identification of the range of functions of individual cyp <dig> proteins, which belong to diverse gene families and possess a variety of conserved domains, is a significant challenge for future research  <cit> . however, the identification of cyp72a <dig> from catharanthus roseus  <cit>  and cyp88d <dig>  from glycyrrhiza uralensis  <cit>  provide examples of efficient approaches and the problems that may be encountered in the determination of biochemical functions of cyp450s.

since lycopodium alkaloids are produced in both of h. serrata and p. carinatus, the relevant lycopodium cyp450s should be present in each of these two species. therefore, to narrow down the list of likely candidate lycopodium cyp <dig> transcripts from the putative cyp450s, unique putative transcripts encoding cyp450s present in both species and showing sequence similarity were considered. these include a total of  <dig> unique putative transcripts  encoding putative cyp450s . the  <dig> contigs of h. serrata were selected for the subsequent real-time pcr analysis. furthermore, due to the fact that the highest level of hup a in h. serrata is in the leaves and the lowest level is in the roots  <cit> , the genes involved in lycopodium alkaloid biosynthesis are expected to be expressed more abundantly in leaves than in roots. to assess changes in gene expression patterns on a functional level, the data were filtered by calculating the fold-change between the expression levels in different organs, and a comparison was made between leaves and roots. thus, twenty putative cyp450s that are more abundantly expressed in h. serrata leaves than in roots were evaluated using real-time pcr analysis as likely candidate cyp450s involved in lycopodium alkaloid biosynthesis . among the twenty putative cyp450s, the expression levels of hs <dig>  hs <dig>  hs <dig>  hs <dig>  hs <dig>  and hs <dig> were significantly higher in leaves than in roots  as showed in fig  <dig>  the selection method by real-time pcr analysis of the candidate cyp450s used in this study was similar to that used for the identification of cyp88d <dig> in g. uralensis  <cit> . cyp88d <dig> was identified after mining of est datasets and subsequent transcript profiling-based selection. the expression profile of cyp88d <dig> was consistent with the organ-specific accumulation pattern of glycyrrhizin  <cit> . the other  <dig> contigs detected h. serrata transcripts that were expressed more highly in roots than in leaves were not considered in our subsequent studies .

besides the above selection, the other potential candidate cyp <dig> selected method using a phylogenetic analysis between the full-length cyp450s from our 454-est datasets and other cyp450s from other plants which were associated with secondary metabolism biosynthesis was performed. more putative cyp <dig> transcripts were amplified and obtained the full-length cdna sequences using rt-pcr and/or the race approach based on the contig sequences including the unique putative transcripts which were showed in fig  <dig>  however, the amplifications of the unique putative transcripts presented in fig  <dig> such as hs <dig>  hs <dig>  hs <dig>  hs <dig>  hs <dig>  hs <dig> and hs <dig> from h. serrata using the race approach were unsuccessful. together, a total of seventeen full-length cyp450s from our 454-est datasets  were used in phylogenetic analysis. the phylogenetic relationship between these cyp450s and characterized cyp450s from other plants is depicted in fig  <dig>  three cyp450s  belong to a group with cyp <dig>  encoding secologanin synthase , which catalyzes the oxidative cleavage of loganin into secologanin  <cit>  . these candidate cyp450s were also expressed more abundantly in leaves than in roots , which is consistent with the organ-specific accumulation pattern of lycopodium alkaloids and thus they may play key roles in alkaloid biosynthesis. it is also noteworthy that the cyp <dig> of hs <dig> is phylogenetically close to these cyp450s  . aau <dig>  encoding -canadine synthase catalyzes the formation of the methylenedioxy bridge in berberine synthesis  <cit> . bab <dig>  encodes a methylenedioxy bridge-forming cytochrome p <dig> dependent enzyme, while adb <dig>  and aco <dig>  encode stylopine synthase, all of which are involved in -stylopine biosynthesis  <cit> . phlegmarine might be modified by an enzyme similar to the berberine bridge enzyme to form lycodane  <cit> . therefore, hs <dig> is a lead candidate for involvement in lycopodium alkaloid biosynthesis. in subsequent studies, we will clone the full-length cdna sequences for these candidates and assess their enzymatic activities in lycopodium alkaloid biosynthesis. in addition, according to the phylogenetic analysis, the cyp450s from one group  might be involved in flavone/flavonoid biosynthesis, and those in another group  might be involved in terpenoid biosynthesis .

the cyp <dig> enzymes involved in lycopodium alkaloid biosynthesis are neither well-characterized nor well-understood. thus, these candidate cyp450s generated in our 454-est datasets will be a valuable resource for cyp <dig> identification in h. serrata and p. carinatus. in addition, unique putative transcripts that show similarities to dioxygenases and methyltransferases are presented in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  and they will be screened using the transcript profiling-based selection method described above for selecting cyp450s. these genes will be further characterized for their biological functions in the biosynthesis of lycopodium alkaloids, which will allow for identification of specific enzymes and elucidation of the entire biosynthetic pathway of the lycopodium alkaloids based on the approaches of modern biochemistry and molecular biology.

genes related to terpenoid and flavone/flavonoid biosynthesis
the serratanes, a unique family of pentacyclic triterpenoids possessing seven tertiary methyls and a central seven-member c-ring, were isolated from plants of the pinaceae and lycopodium species  <cit> . previous studies have revealed the presence of serratane-type triterpenoids in the medicinal plants of h. serrata  <cit> . the mevalonate pathway  and methylerythritol phosphate pathway  play important roles in the biosynthesis of terpenoids by providing precursors for these processes. sequences representing enzymes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis, including most of the steps of the mep and mva pathways, were abundant in our 454-est dataset . unique putative transcripts with homology to known key enzymes in steroid biosynthesis were found in these ests, including transcripts for squalene synthetase, farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase, geranylgeranyltransferase, isopentenyl-diphosphate Δ-isomerase and squalene monooxygenase .

flavonoids, including anthocyanins and flavanols, are polyphenolic secondary metabolites derived from the amino acid phenylalanine and synthesized via the phenylpropanoid pathway  <cit> . these secondary metabolites possess important beneficial health attributes, probably due to their antioxidant activity  <cit> . the identification of genes specific to the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway and the isolation of flavone glycosides from h. serrata suggest that flavonoids, including anthocyanins and flavones, are constituents of this medicinal plant  <cit> . representative genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis were found by blastx searches for unique putative transcripts representing different enzymes in the pathway. there were multiple unique putative transcripts for genes in this pathway, including transcripts encoding cinnamate 4-hydroxylase, chalcone synthase, chalcone isomerase, nadh-dependent 6'-deoxychalcone synthase and flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase  . in the pathway for the production of anthocyanins, unique putative transcripts encoding leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase, anthocyanidin synthase and anthocyanidin 3-o-glucosyltransferase were also prominently found in the h. serrata and p. carinatus 454-est datasets .

genes related to growth and development
the huperziaceae are some of the oldest vascular plants, and they grow very slowly, usually in special habitats. some classes of phytohormones  and transcription factors might play key roles in the regulation of plant development and environmental responses in the huperziaceae plants.

phytohormones, such as auxin, gibberellins , abscisic acid , cytokinins, ethylene and brassinosteroids , play critical roles in the regulation of diverse aspects of plant growth and development as well as in environmental responses  <cit> . the biosynthetic pathways of hormones have been elucidated in several model organisms  <cit> . the 454-est database from h. serrata and p. carinatus contains sequences with homology to many known enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of phytohormones .

unique putative transcripts showing sequence similarities to gibberellin 2-beta-dioxygenase, gibberellin 3-beta-dioxygenase and gibberellin 20-oxidase, all of which are involved in ga biosynthesis, were found in the 454-est datasets from h. serrata and p. carinatus . there were multiple sequences for genes encoding abscisic acid 8'-hydroxylase in the catabolic pathway of aba from h. serrata and p. carinatus . in addition, unique putative transcripts with homology to 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase, which are involved in the biosynthesis of ethylene, were abundant in the h. serrata and p. carinatus 454-est datasets. additionally, unique putative transcripts with homology to cytokinin-o-glucosyltransferase and cytokinin dehydrogenase, which are involved in the biosynthesis of cytokinin, were also abundant in the h. serrata and p. carinatus 454-est datasets . some components involved in hormone signal transduction were also discovered, such as the gibberellin receptors gid1l <dig>  gid1l <dig>  gid1l <dig> and gid1; the ethylene receptor; the auxin response factor; and brassinosteroid insensitive 1-associated receptor kinase  <dig> . these genes might have essential functions in the regulation of development and/or environmental responses in h. serrata and p. carinatus.

transcription factors play key roles in the regulation of gene expression in response to developmental processes and environmental stress in plants  <cit> . in this study, we detected  <dig> h. serrata and  <dig> p. carinatus unique putative transcripts representing homologs belonging to different transcription factor  families, including the myb, homeobox, zinc finger, basic helix-loop-helix, bzip, wrky, aux/iaa, arf and b <dig> family proteins . the most abundant tf family in our datasets was the myb protein family, which is characterized by conserved domains. another highly expressed set of transcription factors was the homeobox family in our datasets. interestingly, unique putative transcripts encoding b <dig> domain transcription factors were expressed abundantly in p. carinatus  but were absent in the h. serrata 454-est dataset . this was a surprising observation, considering the fact that the two species are so closely related. it may be that the timing of material collection corresponded to a period of inactivity of these genes, which would explain the lack of the corresponding transcripts in the h. serrata 454-est dataset.

we also searched for transcription factor genes that are expressed in spatial and temporal patterns indicative of important roles in the regulation of secondary metabolite biosynthesis. several transcription factors involved in the regulation of terpenoid indole alkaloid biosynthesis genes have been isolated and studied  <cit> . some transcription factors serve as positive or negative regulators in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. the molecular functions of the transcription factors which were expressed abundantly in h. serrata and p. carinatus  potentially involved in biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and/or environmental responses will be characterized in a future study.

CONCLUSIONS
this collection of 454-ests from h. serrata and p. carinatus provides a significant resource for gene discovery in these medicinal plants. the results outlined here establish a rapid and cost-effective method for deep transcriptome sequencing using the 454-gs flx titanium platform. the 454-est datasets from h. serrata and p. carinatus provide a description of the expressed genes in these two species, which belong to different genera but the same family. in addition to finding a large number of genetic markers for studies of genetic connectivity and structure, we discovered candidate genes that provide the foundation for functional research on secondary metabolism and growth regulation in the huperziaceae. these unique putative transcripts are likely candidates for the biosynthesis of lycopodium alkaloids, terpenoids and flavones/flavonoids, as well as associated with developmental regulation and environmental responses. our initial h. serrata and p. carinatus 454-est analysis represents a substantial contribution that will increase the opportunities for specific gene discovery and pathway-based studies.
