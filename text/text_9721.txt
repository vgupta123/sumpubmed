BACKGROUND
parkinson’s disease  is the second most common neurodegenerative movement disorder, affecting approximately 1% of individuals older than 60 years  <cit> . the occurrence of pd will most likely double within the next two decades due to an increase in the aging population  <cit> . pd is caused by preferential dopaminergic neuronal cell death in the substantia nigra, resulting in a reduced level of dopamine in the striatum. by the time of clinical diagnosis this region of the brain has irreversibly lost 50–70% of its neurons compared to unaffected individuals  <cit> . despite pd being a complex and multifactorial disease, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are thought to be major causes of neurodegeneration in pd  <cit> . in both idiopathic and genetic pd, oxidative stress is thought to be a common denominator and the substantia nigra of pd subjects exhibit increased levels of oxidized lipids  <cit> , proteins and dna  <cit>  and decreased levels of reduced glutathione   <cit> .

l- <dig> -dihydroxyphenylalanine  remains the most common pd medication as it is converted into dopamine in dopaminergic neurons temporarily relieving motor symptoms. despite its widespread use there is clear controversy in the field. pre-clinical in vivo studies have shown that l-dopa can damage dopaminergic neurons due to oxidative stress and perhaps through other mechanisms  <cit> . studies have shown that direct intraniagral infusion of l-dopa in rats results in reduced dopaminergic neuron numbers  <cit>  whilst other studies have demonstrated that l-dopa increases the levels of nitric oxide in the substantia nigra and striatum  <cit> . in contrast, many in vitro studies have shown that l-dopa may be neuroprotective through decreased lipid peroxidation  <cit> . furthermore, studies have indicated that l-dopa can act as a neuroprotective agent reducing toxicity evoked by stronger oxidants  <cit> . indeed, whether l-dopa is neurotoxic, or has little to no effect on dopaminergic neuron survival, still remains unanswered  <cit> .

despite numerous studies, the molecular interplay between oxidative stress and l-dopa remains fragmented. in this study we have performed a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis -based proteomic study to gain further insight into the effects of l-dopa in response to h2o2-mediated oxidative stress in sh-sy5y neuronal cells. we show that l-dopa influences proteome changes in response to oxidative stress leading to a lowering of reactive oxygen species  and increased cell survival indicative of a role in neuronal cell protection.

RESULTS
cell morphology, viability and proteomic profiling of neuronal cells in response to h2o <dig> and l-dopa treatment
in order to provide a global overview regarding the mechanism in which l-dopa may influence toxic effects of h2o <dig> in neuronal cells we performed cell viability analysis and subsequent proteomic analyses using sh-sy5y cells. although primary neurons or dopaminergic neurons would be ideal for this study in relation to pd we selected sh-sy5y cells based on reproducibility and because they are dopamine beta hydroxylase active. sh-sy5y cells were grown under control conditions and were exposed to 2 mm h2o <dig>  200 μm l-dopa or a combination of the two treatments  for eight hours. cell morphology analysis  and cell viability assays  demonstrated that sh-sy5y cells exposed to l-dopa showed no effect on morphology or cell viability . by contrast, h2o <dig> exposure decreased cell viability, but this effect was reversed in response to co-treatment with l-dopa . this suggested that l-dopa might have a protective effect towards excess oxidative stress.figure  <dig>

based on these findings we then performed a set of proteomic analyses on sh-sy5y cells exposed to the same treatments as described above. the first experiment focused on the effects of h2o <dig> on the neuronal proteome where we compared the proteome profile of sh-sy5y cells under control condition  to cells treated with h2o <dig> . in this experiment we observed significant up-regulation of ten proteins  and significant down-regulation of six proteins  compared to control condition . in a second experiment we compared the proteome profile of cells exposed to l-dopa  to control cells and found one detectable protein  that changes in response to l-dopa exposure . finally, in a third experiment we compared the proteome profile from cells exposed to both h2o <dig> and l-dopa  to control cells  and observed up-regulation of five proteins  and down-regulation of four proteins . interestingly in this comparison spot  <dig> was detected in response to co-treatment with both h2o <dig> and l-dopa but not in the control . although l-dopa can auto-oxidize we did not include catalase in these experiments as our findings show that l-dopa treatment can reverse the decreased cell viability in response to oxidative stress suggesting the presence of the active form of l-dopa in our experimental conditions. detailed information on the number of spots detected in each gel is summarized in table  <dig> table  <dig>

we studied and classified the differentially expressed proteins according to their gene ontology  through uniprot  and quickgo . several biological processes and pathways were affected due to the treatment conditions. for instance the majority of protein changes in response to oxidative stress belong to the “cell motion ” category, most of which were reversed by l-dopa co-treatment. more detailed information regarding the differentially expressed proteins are illustrated in figure  <dig>  summarized in table  <dig> and discussed below.figure  <dig>

oxidative stress changes metabolic routes
glutathione is one of the main cellular antioxidants which prevents damage caused by ros  <cit> . the reduced form of glutathione is oxidized during the conversion of reactive h2o <dig> into h2o by glutathione peroxidase and the oxidized form can be reduced back to its original state via nadph and glutathione reductase. the main source of nadph in cells is through the pentose phosphate pathway .

we observed a dramatic decrease in the expression of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase  in all conditions treated with h2o <dig>  . gapdh catalyzes the conversion of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to d-glycerate  <dig> -bisphosphate as part of glycolysis. gapdh also acts as reversible metabolic switch under oxidative stress conditions where cells require excessive amounts of the antioxidant cofactor nadph  <cit> . indeed, it has been shown that oxidative stress causes an inactivation of gapdh which re-routes the metabolic flux from glycolysis to the ppp  <cit> . this phenomenon in turn allows cells to produce higher levels of nadph to overcome the oxidative conditions. combined with our findings showing h2o2-mediated down-regulation of gapdh, gapdh modulation may have neuroprotective potential  <cit> .

unlike gapdh, lactate dehydrogenase  is up-regulated in response to h2o <dig> exposure . this cytosolic enzyme, involved in oxidation-reduction, can catalyze the conversion of pyruvate to lactate in the absence of oxygen  <cit> . however, ldh can also perform the reverse reaction in oxidative conditions and generate nadh.

similar to the cytosolic routes, oxidative stress impacts the tricarboxylic acid  cycle as well as beta-oxidation of fatty acids in mitochondria. we detected substantial up-regulation of fumarate hydratase  in response to h2o <dig>  a member of the tca cycle that catalyzes the reversible hydration/dehydration of fumarate to malate . the tca cycle generates nadh, which can either be used in respiration or be converted to nadph via nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase . interestingly, the alteration of mitochondrial nucleoside-diphosphate kinase , that catalyzes the exchange of phosphate groups between different nucleoside diphosphates, also supports the involvement of the tca cycle in the oxidative stress response in neurons .

our analysis also showed up-regulation of 3-hydroxyacyl coa dehydrogenase , an oxidoreductase enzyme involved in beta-oxidation of fatty acids catalyzing oxidation of l-3-hydroxyacyl coa by nad + thus generating nadh in response to oxidative stress .

neurons respond to oxidative conditions by enhancing cell survival mechanisms
in the oxidative stress conditions tested we observed up-regulation of proteins involved in cell survival such as annexin a <dig>  peroxiredoxin- <dig> and park7/dj- <dig> .

annexin a <dig>  is known to be a calcium/phospholipid-binding protein that promotes membrane fusion  <cit> . this membrane-associated protein can regulate proliferation and apoptosis via the nf-κb signal transduction pathway  <cit> . annexin a <dig> can also directly improve cell survival by limiting excessive levels of ros during oxidative stress in plant cells. it has been demonstrated that annexin a <dig> from arabidopsis thaliana  is a redox sensor and displays peroxidase activity  <cit> . moreover rhee and co-workers have shown that, annexin i serves as a stress protein in hela cells and that annexins may constitute a new class of stress proteins  <cit> .

similarly, peroxiredoxin- <dig>  involved in redox regulation of the cell, is highly up-regulated  in response to h2o <dig> exposure . peroxiredoxins represent antioxidants with the capacity to mediate signal transduction in mammalian cells  <cit> . indeed, peroxiredoxin- <dig> can reduce h2o <dig> and short chain fatty acid, and phospholipid hydroperoxides  <cit> . moreover, it has been reported that retinal ganglion cells over-expressing peroxiredoxin- <dig> gain resistance against hypoxia-evoked generation of ros and ros-induced cellular insults by negatively regulating nf-κb-mediated death signaling  <cit> .

the substantial up-regulation of park7/dj- <dig> , involved in protecting cells against oxidative stress and cell death, is not entirely surprising . park7/dj- <dig> has numerous reported functions, including anti-oxidative stress reactions, transcriptional regulation, and mitochondrial regulation  <cit> . similar to annexin a <dig> and peroxiredoxin- <dig>  park7/dj- <dig> is also a stress sensor and its expression is increased upon oxidative stress and various other stresses  <cit>  playing a role in regulating the expression or stability of the mitochondrial uncoupling proteins slc25a <dig> and slc25a <dig> in dopaminergic neurons  <cit> . park7/dj- <dig> is also a transcriptional co-activator that protects against neuronal apoptosis and it has been shown that its cytoprotective action is through inhibition of the p53-bax-caspase pathway  <cit> . moreover, it is known that park7/dj- <dig> also enhances cell survival through the binding of cezanne, a negative regulator of nf-kappab  <cit> .

it is also interesting to note that cathepsin x , involved in cell death, is attenuated . this protein is a lysosomal cysteine proteinase and a member of the peptidase c <dig> family with both carboxy-monopeptidase and carboxy-dipeptidase activities  <cit> . it has been reported that α and γ enolases, showing neurotrophic activity, are molecular targets for cathepsin x and that cleavage of c-terminal amino acids of α and γ enolases by cathepsin x abolishes their neurotrophic activity affecting neuronal cell survival and neuritogenesis  <cit> .

down-regulation of cyclophilin d , the only human mitochondrial isoform of cyclophilins, is also notable . cyclophilin d is required for the formation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore leading to cell necrosis  <cit> . in addition, opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, orchestrated by cyclophilin d, underlies oxidative stress-induced axonal degeneration  <cit> . therefore attenuation of this protein in response to oxidative stress seems to play a pivotal role in cell survival.

cytoskeletal modifications by oxidative stress
treatment with h2o <dig> resulted in modification of cell morphology in the absence of l-dopa . indeed, the alteration of several structural proteins, in response to oxidative stress, indicates a rearrangement of the cytoskeleton. we observed up-regulation of all three members of the adf/cofilin family including cofilin- <dig> , cofilin- <dig>  and destrin, also known as adf or actin depolymerizing factor  . cofilins control actin polymerization/depolymerization in a ph-sensitive manner where they bind to actin filaments  and regulate actin cytoskeleton dynamics playing a critical role in the regulation of cytoskeletal organization and cell morphology  <cit> .

conversely, other actin binding proteins, such as tropomyosin alpha- <dig> chain  and tropomyosin alpha- <dig> chain  are down-regulated . these proteins bind to actin filaments in muscle and non-muscle cells and play a central role in muscle contraction and in stabilizing cytoskeleton actin filaments in non-muscle cells  <cit> .

the down-regulation of vimentin  under oxidative conditions is also remarkable . vimentin is attached to the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria and nucleus either laterally or terminally  <cit> . this cytoskeletal component plays an important role in anchoring organelles in the cytosol and is responsible for maintaining cell shape, cytoplasmic integrity, and stabilization of cytoskeletal interactions  <cit> . cells deficient in vimentin are therefore extremely delicate  <cit>  suggesting that the observed change in neuronal cell morphology in response to h2o <dig> may be due to the observed attenuation of vimentin .

l-dopa promotes reversal of oxidative stress responses
an interesting phenomenon that was observed in our treatments is the ability of l-dopa to reverse the effects of h2o <dig> on cellular morphology and cell viability . this reversal was also observed in terms of ros where l-dopa exposure reduced ros levels, in the presence of h2o <dig>  down to levels observed in control cells . indeed, all the h2o2-induced protein alterations, affecting the cytoskeleton, were restored to baseline by supplementing the h2o2-containing media with l-dopa  . furthermore, the induction of mitochondrial enzymes under oxidative stress condition , nucleoside-diphosphate kinase  and 3-hydroxyacyl coa dehydrogenase  was abolished in response to l-dopa exposure .figure  <dig>

effects of l-dopa
only cells exposed to l-dopa under oxidative stress conditions show significantly elevated expression of a 60-kda heat shock protein , a mitochondrial protein with cytoprotective functions  <cit> . this observation suggests that l-dopa can mediate mitochondrial associated cell survival mechanisms as has been previously reported when exposing postnatal mesencephalic cultures, grown on glia monolayers, to l-dopa in excess of 100 μm  <cit> . this heat shock protein contributes to the anti-apoptotic hsp60/procaspase- <dig> complex and enhances cell survival  <cit> . it has been observed that mild hsp <dig> deficiency primarily affects neuronal and/or glia cells, whereas more severe hsp <dig> deficiency affects all tissues  <cit> .

in addition to its effects on the cytoskeleton and mitochondria, l-dopa seems to participate in a cell survival mechanism triggered by oxygen deprivation through induction of the hypoxia up-regulated protein  <dig> , a chaperone involved in protein folding  <cit> . we observed detectable levels of this protein only in the presence of l-dopa regardless of the oxidative stress conditions  suggesting that l-dopa may aid hypoxia condition in cells. it has been shown in rat astrocytes that orp <dig> is induced by hypoxia within 24 hours, augmented further during early re-oxygenation, and thereafter decreasing to baseline levels by 24 hours in normoxia  <cit> . furthermore, the hypoxia-mediated induction of orp <dig> appears specific as stress conditions such as heat shock, h2o <dig>  cobalt chloride, 2-deoxyglucose, or tunicamycin does not affect orp <dig> levels  <cit> . interestingly, exposure to dopamine has similar orp induction effects as hypoxia in pc <dig> cells  <cit> . in the catecholamine synthesis pathway dopamine is the first catecholamine synthesized from l-dopa where norepinephrine and epinephrine are formed by further metabolic dopamine modifications . the conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine requires oxygen, thus the higher level of oxygen consumption due to l-dopa exposure may cause cellular hypoxia and therefore induction of orp <dig> with its concomitant cytoprotective effects.figure  <dig>

our findings, combined with previous data, suggest that although l-dopa appears to influence neuronal cell survival pathways, this is most probably an indirect effect through the induction of endogenous antioxidant mechanisms  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
there is clear controversy surrounding l-dopa effects associated with oxidative stress  <cit> . using a 2de-based proteomic study we have shown that oxidative stress changes neuronal metabolic routes and affects cytoskeletal integrity. interestingly, l-dopa reverses some of these h2o2−mediated effects at the cell morphology and cell viability level , at the ros level  and at the protein level . exposure to l-dopa may aid hypoxia condition in cells and therefore induction of orp <dig> with its concomitant cytoprotective effects. however, l-dopa exposure may simply evoke endogenous antioxidant mechanisms  <cit>  and it cannot be ruled out that l-dopa has direct ros scavenging action  <cit> . our study sheds light on the molecular interplay linking oxidative stress and l-dopa in neuronal cells. furthermore, the data presented here highlights the complex nature of l-dopa in pd, demonstrating that additional studies are required that addresses l-dopa action in the context of appropriate experimental design and choice of model mimicking pd.
