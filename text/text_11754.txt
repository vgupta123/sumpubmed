BACKGROUND
telomerase, which adds repeated telomere sequences to chromosome ends, is a ribonucleoprotein enzyme that includes an endogeneous rna  which acts as a template and a reverse transcriptase , and are crucial molecules  <cit> . telomerase activity has been detected in immortalized and tumor cells and its strong expression represents an important difference between normal and cancer cells  <cit> . although it is thought that telomere maintenance is predominantly due to telomerase activity  <cit> , which is mainly regulated by htert expression in the presence of htr  <cit> , some gaps exist in the steps between immortalization, carcinogenesis, and cellular senescence  <cit> . therefore, these unknown steps must first be fully identified before translational applications are possible  <cit> . as several reports have indicated that human chromosome 10p carries a set of genes involved in regulating telomerase activity  <cit> , we performed microcell-mediated chromosome transfer, radiated microcell fusion, and bacterial artificial chromosome  transfer assuming loss of heterozygosity , and examined telomerase expression in transfectants to determine whether htr- and htert-regulating genes are located on 10p <dig>  <cit> . after we determined the telomerase regulatory regions on chromosome 10p <dig>  using dna markers, we confirmed that the chromosomal fragments containing the regions induce senescence in the transfectants  <cit> . we then identified that radiated chromosomal fragments containing d10s <dig>  induced senescence in transfectants, and performed the sequencing of  <dig> bac clones containing d10s <dig>  <cit>  , exon trapping using the bac clones  <cit> , northern blotting, and rt-pcr before cloning several full-length genes. one of the genes we cloned was named rgm <dig> , and showed stronger gene expression in cancerous lesions than in normal liver.

we used the rna interference  method, which is a sequence-specific post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanism triggered by double-stranded rna , to cause degradation of mrnas homologous in sequence to dsrna and to effectively inhibit gene-specific expression  <cit> . because dsrna transfection is a common strategy for suppressing genes of interest, the small interfering rna  technique is an excellent gene-specific method for determining the function of the targeted gene by inhibiting its expression  <cit> . after focusing on rgm <dig>  among the genes cloned on 10p14– <dig> for further analyses, we examined the telomerase regulatory function of rgm <dig> using the overexpressing cassette and the gene-specific sirna.

in this report, we present a summary of our cloning research and introduce functional analyses regarding the identified gene regulating htert mrna.

RESULTS
screening of bac library and transfection into hmc-li7
we investigated the  <dig> bac clones using a sequence-tagged-site marker  by pcr, based on previous reports  <cit> . from these studies, we determined that the  <dig> bac clones  contained d10s <dig> 

whole sequencing of h- <dig> and exon trapping
approximately 90%~95% of the bac clone h- <dig> sequence and supercontig were determined . d10s <dig> was regarded as the sequence on 10p <dig> . we reconfirmed that the sequence and supercontig were derived from the original bac clones by southern blotting and pcr, and  <dig> exons were thereafter identified ). we performed a computer analysis for each contig, and the endosequences of the  <dig> bac clones and the exon sequences we trapped showed that they closely overlapped each other ).

northern blot analysis and one-step real-time rt-pcr
using a probe against each exon sequence , northern blotting was performed, which demonstrated that several exons showed a very faint signal . in particular, a very faint single hybridization signal in human multiple tissue northern  blot  migrating at about  <dig> bp was determined for rgm <dig>  one-step real-time rt-pcr showed a very low expression rate, that is, less than  <dig>  copies per  <dig> ng of total rna extracted from human organs ). in normal liver, approximately  <dig> copies per  <dig> ng of total rna of transcripts were expressed. in contrast, the study on human primary hepatocyte cultures, including nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments in  <dig> hepatoma cell lines , indicated that hepatoma cells expressed rgm <dig> at much higher levels than normal human hepatocytes ). in  <dig> hepatomas, the expression rate was higher  than in the  <dig> adjacent noncancerous lesions   ).

5' & 3' race and cdna library screening
5' and 3' race was performed using liver c dna libraries . screening of the cdna libraries yielded a clone with a full sequence length of  <dig> bp. a comparison of the cdna sequence with the genomic sequence from h- <dig> revealed that the gene of interest was extended across  <dig> kb. the cdna named rgm <dig> consisted of  <dig> exons and the rna was not poly-adenylated ). the sequence with about 40% of the gc ratio is shown in fig 3-, indicating that this gene might be a noncoding rna  gene, as shown in fig 3-. pcr-single strand conformation polymorphism  and sequencing showed that the gene had no mutations other than a one-base addition at the last site of exon  <dig> in  <dig> normal liver tissue samples  and no mutations in  <dig> tumor cell lines . although the cdna showed no homology with either additional human loci except for the endogeneous locus, or mouse genome, the mirna predicted to be digested from rgm <dig> by dicer matched at least  <dig> mirnas in the mirna database  . although their functions remain unknown because we have not fully clarified whether rgm <dig> is actually processed by dicer in vivo, given that it can be processed by dicer in vitro. on the other hand, a motif search predicted no motifs in the rgm <dig> gene. because this gene generated no protein, the secondary structure of rgm <dig> was drawn based on the structure provided at  ). moreover, because the full-length rna was digested by dicer enzymes, 20– <dig> bp sharp bands could be observed, indicating that nucleotides generated from rgm <dig> rna may be mirnas ).

the effects of downregulating rgm249
in many htert- or htr-regulating molecules reported previously, only two factors, htert and ribosomal protein l <dig> , were transcriptionally suppressed in the hepatoma-derived cell lines  transfected with full-length rgm <dig> dsrna ) <cit> . to reconfirm the findings in dsrna method, the sirna method was performed. results showed that their expressions were suppressed in hlf cells transfected with stealth sirna ① ,).

rgm <dig> sirna suppressed more than 90% of htert mrna, approximately 50% of rpl <dig> mrna, and rgm <dig> transcripts ) unlike htr expression. however, rpl <dig> expression in cells transfected with stealth sirna ① was weaker  than in those transfected with full-length dsrna ). sirna ① + ② had less efficient knockdown due to the interaction between both sirnas. these findings are consistent with our results obtained from dsrna induction, an experiment performed under conditions of almost negligible cytokine storm. a similar result was obtained about  <dig> hours after transfection.

subsequently, we examined the inhibitory effect of shrna transfection. compared with lacz shrna, we found that rgm <dig> shrna and mt-1rgm <dig> shrna significantly downregulated htert mrna ). otherwise, no significant differences were observed, except for the effect on rgm <dig> mrna. similar to transfectants that received rgm <dig> sirna, telomerase activity in transfectants with shrna was suppressed in the same manner as mrna expression, compared with that in transfectants with lacz shrna ). telomere length was not measured due to the small number of cells available and the relatively short observation period. no immunoreactive effects on tumor cell proliferation resulting from cytokine storm were recognized in the ge profile by microarray analysis, which resulted in ifn-β being downregulated twofold.

the effects of overexpressing rgm <dig> mrna
in the transfection of hlf or a <dig> cells showing rgm <dig> overexpression, as distinct from the transfection of other cell lines such as senescing or well-differentiated cells, htert mrna was significantly downregulated. in particular, the growth of a <dig> transfectants was strongly suppressed and they were induced to undergo senescence. on the other hand, htert mrna was upregulated in kmst cells, which was established by exposure to chemical oncogens . however, the expression of htr, β-actin, and rpl <dig> mrna showed no significant differences between mock transfectants and rgm <dig> transfectants in kmst cells, similar to the transcriptional level of c-myc, undifferentiated markers , and an initiation factor . additionally, the longevity and proliferation rate of transfectants were almost the same as those of the parental cells or mock transfectants. interestingly, we examined the effect of rgm <dig> shrna wrapped by cationized carriers on tumorigenesis in nude mice using local or venous injection, which resulted in more than 60% of the suppressive effect in vivo . facs analysis showed that rgm <dig> mrna expression introduced more than half of rgm <dig> prnat/u <dig> /neo/gfp-transfected populations into the preg <dig> phase ), senescence, and apoptosis ), compared with prnat/u <dig> /neo/gfp-transfectants. these phenotypic changes were similar to the effects of rgm <dig> shrna, compared with those of lacz shrna

loh in human hepatocellular carcinoma  is rare, except at 10q <dig> -qter, which is observed in 25% of hcc cases . however, relatively frequent alterations and deletions of chromosome 10p have been identified in human tumors, including glioblastoma multiforme  and malignant melanoma  <cit> . in gbm,  <dig> common distinct regions of chromosome  <dig> deletion have been frequently identified; one of them is the distal half of the short arm  <cit> , indicating that several distinct tumor suppressor genes may be present on chromosome  <dig> and may contribute to the progression of malignant tumors. structural alterations have only been observed in malignant melanoma , gastric cancer , and gbm . unexpectedly, rgm <dig> with low gc ratio on 10p <dig>  is potently mirnas-generating gene, as well as cancer-related gene.

it is well known that a mirna, generated from a mirna precursor gene, can act as a new regulator which induces cancer cell lines to adopt a suppressive phenotype, except for the tumor suppressor gene. because the phenotype we observed in a series of transfections with a chromosome  or bac was suppressed, this mirna might be a suppressor-mir or it might have demonstrated a mirna-directed inhibition. actually, rgm <dig> repressed htert mrna in a <dig> cells derived from gbm, moderately differentiated hcc , and poorly differentiated hlf. beyond 60s rpl <dig>  which we referred to in this study, several ribosomal protein mrnas changed their expression level after the introduction of sirna or shrna into cell lines or tumors inoculated in nude mice . in a mirna-mediated mrna repression study, rpl <dig>  of which greider et al. previously referred to as one of the binding protein to htr that is essentially required for telomere maintenance and telomerase activity in normal tissues and disease, showed no significant alteration in expression level, whereas it showed an obvious change in sirna-directed rnai with reproducibility  <cit> . we do not have any definite evidence that rpl <dig> functions in association with htert expression during carcinogenesis or in hypoxic tissues. however, while endogenous htr expression is regulated at the transcriptional level, htert is regulated by alternative splicing under hypoxic conditions  <cit> . it may be that rpl <dig> influences htert expression through htr expression. rgm <dig> dsrna repressed rpl <dig>  however, rgm <dig> sirna and shrna did not significantly repress rpl <dig> because of the high homology shared by  <dig> parts of the rgm <dig> sequence which are different from the functional sequence, which was used in sirna or shrna and corresponds to one part of the rpl <dig> sequence. eukaryotic initiation factor  <dig>  has long been known to bind to free 60s ribosomal subunits, preventing the assembly of translationally competent 80s ribosome particles  <cit> . similar to eif4e bound to argonaute <dig> , which regulates mrna expression by cleaving its mrna targets and competing with eif <dig> for the mrna cap  <cit> , eif <dig> may mediate sirna-directed rna interference rather than mirna-directed translational repression. this study indicates that the sequence focused for sirna or shrna has a key function in this gene, and that rgm <dig> may functionally have a close link to gene-mediated processes at the transcriptional level, such as rna biogenesis or gene regulation, and a link to ribonucleoproteins such as telomerase or rpl <dig>  as a result, rna molecules may induce suppressive or apoptotic events in cancer cells through an rgm249-related signaling pathway involved in a dna-, rna-, or protein-binding function 

mirna is physiologically generated by both drosha and dicer. we can not digest rgm <dig> mrna by drosha because drosha protein is now unavailable commercially. rgm <dig> rna processed by dicer, results in at least  <dig> small fragments of a product  related to rna species ). the sequencing of diced rgm <dig> mrna proved that the sequence we used for sirna or shrna was included in fig 3-. because the silencing of rgm <dig> induced the downregulation of htert expression, this gene may be involved in the oncogenic mechanism. in humans, ~ <dig> mirnas are predicted to exist  <cit> ; each of these is thought to have hundreds of targets, suggesting that mirnas play a critical regulatory role in cellular protein expression  <cit> . in various human cancers as well as in developmental timing and patterning, differentiation, organogenesis, and stress response, alterations of mirna profiles have been observed; these mirnas may act as oncogenes, leading to the specific dysregulation of their target gene transcripts  <cit> . although alterations in mirna expression have been described in cancer and may contribute to other disease states, it remains unclear what drives these alterations. our findings might pave the way for defining unknown crucial roles that mirnas located around this locus play in oncogenic regulation through htert regulation and, in particular, the role rgm <dig> may play during this process.

although the way in which rgm <dig> regulates htert remains unidentified, the physiological expression of rgm <dig> synchronizes the upregulation of htert mrna, and its excess expression using the rna-expression vector downregulated htert in specific cancer cells. moreover, its sirna or shrna suppressed htert. taken together, rgm <dig> may function negatively or positively, reversibly or indirectly on unknown mediators upstream of htert. using microarray analysis between transfectants with rgm <dig> sirna and those with lacz sirna , the comparative expression analysis demonstrated that atm and tp53lp were upregulated, although p <dig> status  in each cell line did not correlate with htert mrna expression, and ras and several transcriptional factors were downregulated. as described in fig  <dig>  rgm <dig> may have direct effects on several transcriptional factors. rapid stress induced by sirnas may induce upregulation of genes participating in both repairing action and apoptotic or growth inhibition induction. comparative proteome analysis would be useful to explain the detailed mechanisms underlying these processes. the overexpression of rgm <dig> in normal cells did not alter htert expression level, suggesting that rna-related molecules may be functionally different in normal cells and de-differentiated cells, and that a key molecule for uncovering the oncogenesis mechanism or a potential factor which could be applied as a therapeutic target may exist in the genome. the findings that both the overexpression and dsrna knockdown of rgm <dig> suppressed the expression of htert are problematic. in addition, this gene may be indirectly associated with htert because its overexpression may not always reveal a normal function and rgm <dig> micrornas are not predicted to bind to htert even with the use of available bioinformatics. moreover, this gene is not mutated or homozygously deleted even in hcc cells and tissues. based on the celera assembly, it seems to have one base  addition at position  <dig> of the first exon, however, single nucleotide polymorphisms are not specific to cancer. additional experiments such as promoter analysis are needed to elucidate the epigenetic network in which this gene works.

this novel noncoding gene is strongly expressed in poorly differentiated tumor cells. the genes  targeted commonly by both mirnas and sirnas in our study were mapk <dig> and prkca, which can induce htert upregulation ). representative genes  targeted by mirnas with expression upregulated more than twofold by shrgm249rna included dicer <dig>  high mobility group a <dig>  and gas <dig>  as well as hsa-mir-let 7b, 7d, 7e, 7f, and 7g targets. in particular, rgm <dig> might be implicated in oncogenic transformation through the inhibition of hmga <dig> interacting with let- <dig> mirna , )  <cit> . rgm <dig> was not detected in any 'mirtrons or polycistron' detection program, genome, or mirna database  <cit> . we are now considering med <dig> as a key molecule obtained from microarray analysis   <cit> . the mediator head module stimulates basal rna pol ii transcription and enables transcriptional regulation. the head subunits med <dig>  med <dig>  and med <dig> form a subcomplex  with  <dig> submodules. the highly conserved n-terminal domain of med <dig> forms one submodule that binds the tata box-binding protein  in vitro and is essential in vivo. beyer et al. reported that the downregulation of another mediator complex  expression in nih3t <dig> cells results in a significant induction of several genes associated with smooth muscle cell  differentiation and functions as a repressor of smc differentiation  <cit> . a mediator complex is essential for transcription induced by pol ii in eukaryotes and is required for the recruitment of the transcription machinery after chromatin remodeling  <cit> . med <dig> may also be involved in the repression of differentiation, transcription, and telomere elongation. microarray analysis revealed a strong upregulation of med <dig> , the rna polymerase ii mediator which functions as a coactivator involved in transcription regulation in nearly all rna polymerase ii-dependent genes, and other rna-related or dna-binding genes were upregulated . in transfectants with med <dig> sirna, both rgm <dig> and htert mrna were significantly upregulated ). med <dig> sirna transfected into a <dig> cells significantly upregulated htert mrna and rgm <dig> expression ). co-transfection by both med <dig> sirna and htert sirna upregulated only rgm <dig> mrna, suggesting that rgm <dig> may functionally locate upstream htert mrna, and med <dig> may closely interact with rgm <dig>  overexpressing rgm <dig> is carried out for the purpose of comprehending the possible suppressive effects of mirnas and depleting rgm <dig> is performed for the purpose of understanding the physiological function of this gene. our results suggest that rgm <dig> may not be a precursor gene such as onco-mir but is a suppressor-mir and might function to lower differentiation in its expressing cells by suppressing cell growth as an independent response to htert expression.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, the enhanced cell death in rgm <dig> transfectants likely resulted from an htert-independent mechanism or the presence of a mediator with crucial responsibility for oncogenesis, arguing that some other targets instead of htert might be the real players mediating these contradictory oncogenic and growth suppressive functions. it should be noted that mrna studies do not always reflect processes at the protein level of gene regulation.

further studies will be required to investigate these expression levels. several ncrnas in the exons we trapped might provide new insights into the coordinated and dynamic mechanisms of development, stress, transformation, and differentiation, resulting in the possible prevention of oncogenesis and suppression of tumor progression.
