BACKGROUND
porcine circovirus-like virus p <dig>  the smallest dna virus in terms of its genome size, was isolated from pigs with postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome   <cit> . its genome consists of a single-stranded, covalently closed circular molecule of only  <dig> nucleotides. electron micrographs showed that the p <dig> virion is a non-enveloped particle with a diameter of about 25 nm.

pmws, a swine disease that occurs worldwide, was first identified in a swine herd in canada  <cit> . it is characterized by progressive weight loss, respiratory symptoms, and jaundice, and has had a significant economic impact on the pig industry  <cit> . porcine circovirus type  <dig>  is considered the causative agent of pmws. pcv <dig>  a member of the genus circovirus in the family circoviridae, is a nonenveloped, icosahedral virus with a single-stranded circular dna genome of approximately  <dig>  kb  <cit> .

the overall dna sequence homology between the p <dig> isolates is greater than 99%, whereas the sequence homology between p <dig> and pcv <dig> isolates is  <dig> %— <dig> %, although p <dig> has high nucleotide sequence homology compared with pcv <dig> isolates. a phylogenetic analysis suggested that p <dig> isolates are closely related to pcv <dig> isolates.

epidemiological studies have reported that 19% of swine in china are p1-viremic  <cit> . data from pigs transfected with an infectious dna clone of p <dig> indicated that p <dig> can also cause pmws-like clinical disease in pigs  <cit> . the genomic sequences of a number of p <dig> isolates have been determined. p <dig> consists of three potential open reading frames  larger than  <dig> nucleotides , analyzed with the dnaman software. the genome of p <dig> is ambisense  <cit> , and orfs  <dig> and  <dig>  are encoded by the viral  strand, whereas orf <dig> is encoded by the viral  stranded. the genetic basis for p <dig> pathogenicity cannot be determined from the genomic sequences, although the genomic sequences of many p <dig> viral isolates have been determined. so far only a few transcriptional analyses of pcv <dig> have been reported, but up to  <dig> rnas have been detected  <cit> . nine of these rnas  of pcv <dig> have also been identified in these studies  <cit> . until now, no transcriptional analysis of p <dig> has been reported. to better understand the mechanism of p <dig> pathogenesis, it is essential to know how many genes it expresses. in this study, we detected and mapped eight virus-specific rnas in p1-transfected pk <dig> cells.

methods
p <dig> virus genomic dna
the full-length genome of the p <dig> virus jsnj was isolated from the serum of a piglet with pmws. all sample collection was conducted between december  <dig> and january  <dig> in jiangsu province, china. permission to collect the study samples was granted by the pig farms. all procedures involving animals throughout the study were approved by the committee on the ethics of animal experiments at the institute of veterinary medicine, jiangsu academy of agricultural sciences, china. the viral sequences were determined after the genome was amplified with pcr. the genome was digested singly bamhi, tandem dimers were ligated with t <dig> dna ligase, and the dimeric genomes inserted into the bamhi site of the pbluescript sk  vector . the cloned constructs were used for in vitro transfection assays.

cell culture and transfection
a pk <dig> cell line  <cit>  free of pcv <dig>  pcv <dig>  and mycoplasma contamination was maintained in rpmi  <dig> medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and  <dig> % penicillin–streptomycin in 5% co <dig> at 37°c. the cells were transfected with lipofectaminetm  <dig> , according to theprotocol recommended by the manufacturer. dna  was used to transfect  <dig> cells in six-well plates. the transfected cells and the culture media were harvested at different times  and frozen at −80°c before rna extraction. the psk vector control was used to check for any nonspecific responses, and no specific bands were detected with either northern blotting or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction .

rna isolation and preparation
total rna was extracted from the transfected cells with trizol reagent , according to the manufacture’s instructions. the quality of the rna template was assessed by the ratio of 28s:18s rnas on a denaturing formaldehyde agarose gel after it was stained with ethidium bromide. the rna concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at 260 nm.

the total rnas isolated at selected times for northern blotting analysis were not treated with dnasei, and the vector dna was used as an internal control. any residual dna was removed from the rna samples for both rt-pcr and the random amplification of cdna ends  with the turbo dna-freetm kit , according to the manufacture’s instructions. a control pcr reaction without the rt step was also conducted to ensure that the input p <dig> plasmid dna was completely digested by dnasei.

for rt-pcr, 1 μg of rna was reverse transcribed at 42°c for 1 h using avian myeloblastosis virus  reverse transcriptase and an oligo <dig> primer, according to the protocol of the manufacturer .

5′- and 3′- race products were generated from first-strand cdna synthesized from 1 μg of total rna in a 10 μl reaction mixture using the smartertm race cdna amplification kit , according to the manufacturer’s protocol. in this reaction, rna was reverse transcribed with smartscribe reverse transcriptase at 42°c for 90 min. the 3′-cds primer a or 5′-cds primer a and smarter iia oligonucleotide were used to synthesize 3′-race-ready cdna and 5′-race-ready cdna, respectively.

northern blotting analysis
single-stranded rnas were prepared by in vitro transcription using t <dig> rna polymerase. the p <dig> molecular dna clone was used as the template for pcr to generate the  and  p <dig> transcripts. the primer sets were probe r , and probef . two digoxigenin -labelled viroid-specific riboprobes were synthesized using the dig rna labelling kit  , as recommended by the manufacturer.

the rnas were separated with 1% formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis  and electroblotted  onto positively charged nylon membranes  by capillary transfer in 20 × saline sodium citrate  and immobilized for 2 h at 80°c. the membranes were prehybridized for 2 h at 68°c with roche dig easy hyb and then hybridized overnight at 68°c in dig easy hyb containing the denatured probe. after hybridization, the membranes were washed twice  in  <dig>  × ssc/ <dig> % sodium dodecyl sulfate  solution at 68°c, equilibrated for 2–5 min in washing buffer, blocked in blocking solution with gentle agitation for 1 h, incubated for 30 min in alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated anti-dig antibody, washed twice  in washing buffer, and incubated for 5 min in cspd® substrate . following the chemiluminescent detection procedure, the membranes were exposed to x-ray films for 10–30 min.

an rna molecular weight marker i, dig-labeled   was used as the size standard.

rt-pcr
pcr was used to amplify the cdna generated from about 20 ng of total rna in triplicate, in a final volume of 25 μl, using specific primers. an aliquot  of the reaction mixture was analyzed with gel electrophoresis after 35 cycles of amplification. the primers used for rt-pcr were 170f: 5′-tttgttatttggttggaagtaatcaatagt-3′; 462r: 5′-ccaggaggggggaccaacaaa-3′; 485f: 5′-aatctcatcatgtccaccgcccaggag-3′; 579r: 5′-ggcatcttcaacacccgcctc-3′; 288f: 5′-ggtcataggtttgggccgtgg-3′; 577f: 5′-gccatttttccttctccaacg-3′; and 36r: 5′-ttaatcttaagggccccccac-3′.

race
5′- and 3′-race pcr amplification were performed using the 5′-race-ready and 3′-race-ready cdnas, respectively. race-pcr was performed with the universal primer a mix  from the smarterrace cdna amplification kit, and the primers appropriate to 5′-race or 3′-race. the conditions for amplification were those recommended by the manufacturer: five cycles of denaturation at 94°c for 30 s, annealing-extension at 72°c for 3 min; followed by five cycles at 94°c for 30 s, 70°c for 30 s, and 72°c for 3 min; and finally, 25 cycles of 94°c for 30 s, 68°c for 30 s, and 72°c for 3 min. all the products were analyzed with gel electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels, purified after gel elution, cloned into the pmd-18 t vector , and sequenced. two controls were also used to exclude the possibility of nonspecific amplification. one control reaction was performed with only one viral-specific primer, and the other was performed with upm alone. no bands were amplified in either control.

the primers used for rt-pcr were 267f: 5′-cgggaggagtagttacatatggg-3′; 540f: 5′-tatatccgaaggtacgggagagg-3′; 536r: 5′-tcaaggctaccacagtcagaacg-3′; 640f: 5′-agtggatcctcatttagggtttaagtgg-3′; 299r: 5′-aaacctatgacccatatgtaact-3′; 343r: 5′-ccctgttattctagatgataactttg-3′; 425r: 5′-cccactacagaataagaaaggttaag-3′;248r: 5′-cttctcctaccactcccgttact-3′; 562r: 5′-cctctcccgtaccttcggatata-3′;541f: 5′-atatccgaaggtacgggagaggc-3′; 30r: 5′-ctaaagaccccccacttaaaccc-3′; and 285f: 5′-atgggtcataggtttgggccgtg-3′.

virus and expression of recombinant orf <dig> protein
the purified p <dig> virus was produced as previously described  <cit> . briefly, pk <dig> cells were transfected with the p <dig> dna clone and harvested at 96 h. the cells were frozen and thawed three times, and centrifuged in two rounds of cscl density gradient ultracentrifugation. the p <dig> virus was collected by aspiration and dialysis.

to construct an expression plasmid encoding the orf <dig> protein, orf <dig> of p <dig> was amplified by pcr using primers 5′-ggcggatccatgagatttaatattgacgac-3′ and 5′-atactcgaggccaaagctgattccttttg-3′ . the pcr products were cloned into the pmd-18 t vector, doubly digested with bamhi and xhoi, and cloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pet-32a  . the resulting recombinant expression plasmid was used to transform escherichia coli dh5α cells and was identified by restriction enzyme digestion and dna sequencing.

to express the cloned orf <dig>  e. coli bl <dig>  plys cells were transformed with the pet32a–orf <dig> plasmid. single colonies of transformants were grown in luria–bertani medium at 37°c to an optical density at 600 nm  of about  <dig> – <dig> , and isopropylthio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. after induction at 20°c for 12 h, the bacteria were collected by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min and lysed by boiling for 10 min. the fusion proteins from the whole-cell lysates and the virus purified by cscl gradient centrifugation were analyzed with sds polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  and immunoblotting, respectively. the rabbit anti-p <dig> hyperimmune serum used for immunoblotting was prepared as described previously  <cit> .

RESULTS
molecular cloning of the p <dig> genome
the complete genomic dna sequence of the p <dig> virus was isolated from the serum collected from a pig in china suffering from pmws using pcr and primer sets f and r, which each contain a bamhi site  <cit> . a p <dig> clone, designated p1/jsnj, was selected and sequenced. the genomic sequence of p1/jsnj was 648 nt long  and is presented in figure  <dig>  this sequence is more than 99% homologous to other p <dig> sequences in the genbank database. after restriction enzyme digestion and ligation with t <dig> dna ligase, the tandem dimers were inserted into the bamhi site of the psk vector.figure  <dig>

northern blotting analysis
this experiment was performed with two single-stranded riboprobes to determine the orientation and the relative abundance of the viral rnas. total cellular rnas isolated at the designated times after transfection were hybridized with the two riboprobes. probe f containing the dna sequence of nt 67– <dig> hybridized to the 380 nt rna corresponding to orf <dig> and the internal control fragment, indicating that orf <dig> is transcribed in the left-ward orientation. the 380-nt rna was observed from 12 h after transfection and increased in a time-dependent way. the 96 h sample gave the strongest signal . probe r containing the dna sequence at nt 576– <dig>  hybridized to the 350-nt rna  and the internal control band. the 12 h sample gave the strongest signal, but there was no obvious relationship between the amount of orf <dig> rna and time .figure  <dig>

pcr analysis
at least two virus-specific rnas were synthesized in pk <dig> cells transfected with a dimers of the p <dig> virus genome, as demonstrated with northern blotting. to explore the minor rnas synthesized from p <dig>  the rna samples were assayed with both rt-pcr and race. the pcr products were analyzed with gel electrophoresis under standard low-voltage conditions, and after the resulting dna fragments were separated, they were cloned into the pmd-18 t vector. at least six clones of each pcr product were selected for sequencing.

race analysis
the 5′- and 3′- race products were generated from a first-strand cdna template subjected to pcr amplification with 10× upm and the designed primers.

5′ initiation sites
orf <dig> and orf <dig>  pcr with upm and 267f generated two clones with a 5′-initiation site at nt  <dig> and four clones with a 5′-initiation site at nt  <dig>  we assumed that the former was used by orf <dig> and the latter by orf <dig> 

orf <dig>  the 5′-initiation site at nt  <dig> was detected in a band of about 150 bp after pcr with the primer pair ump and 540f.

orf <dig>  the 5′-initiation site  for orf <dig> was detected in a fragment of about 210 bp with pcr using the primer pair ump and 536r.

orf <dig>  pcr with upm and 640f generated three clones with the 5′-terminal nt at  <dig> 

orf <dig>  orf <dig> and orf <dig>  pcr with upm/299r, upm/343r, and upm/425r produced many bands. sequence analysis of the 110-bp, 130-bp, and 200-bp fragments showed that four clones had a 5′-initiation nt at  <dig>  three clones at nt  <dig>  and five clones at nt  <dig>  respectively. we assumed these sites were used by orf <dig>  orf <dig>  and orf <dig>  respectively .figure  <dig>

3′ poly sites
orf <dig> and orf <dig>  pcr with upm and 248r generated a 160-bp fragment that produced four clones with 3′-terminal at nt  <dig>  presumably, this poly site is used by orf <dig> and orf <dig> rnas.

orf <dig>  the 3′ poly site at nt  <dig> was identified from a band of about 120-bp after pcr with upm and 562r.

orf <dig>  the 3′ poly site at nt  <dig> was identified from a fragment of about 220-bp after pcr with upm and 541 f.

orf <dig>  the 3′ poly site at nt  <dig> was identified from the 140-bp band after pcr with upm and 30r.

orf <dig>  orf <dig> and orf <dig>  pcr with upm and 285f generated a 210-bp fragment that produced four clones with 3′-terminal nt at  <dig>  we inferred that this poly site is used by orf <dig>  orf <dig>  and orf <dig> rnas .figure  <dig>

discussion
whether the p <dig> virus is really a virus remains highly debatable in the circovirus research community. some in the field speculate that p <dig> may represent a replication-competent subviral particle of pcv <dig>  similar to another virus with a circular genome, ttv  <cit> . however, unlike the intragenomic rearrangement of pcv <dig> reported in our previous study  <cit> , the p <dig> virus contains exogenous dna fragments. until now, three recombinants of pcv <dig>  have been identified during molecular epidemiological surveys using pcr  <cit> . among these recombinants, we speculated that p <dig> is a recombinant virus formed between pcv <dig> and another virus . this notion may prompt the reevaluation of pcv <dig> and pmws and may also support the use of the same strategy to investigate the rnas of pcv <dig> and pcv <dig>  <cit> . its extremely small genome makes p <dig> a suitable tool for studying viral gene expression and replication. despite its very small genome, p <dig> still displays a very complex transcription model, with eight viral rnas identified in p1-transfected cells in this study. two major rnas  were easily detected with northern blotting; some rnas  were detected with pcr, and all eight rnas  were detected with race. of the two p1-encoded transcripts detected with northern blotting, one  is encoded on the viral  strand, and we believe that it is encoded by orf <dig>  the other abundant transcript  is encoded on the viral  strand, and we assume that it is encoded by orf <dig>  we have shown that p <dig> mrna is transcribed from both strands of the genomic molecule. orf <dig>  orf <dig>  orf <dig>  and orf <dig> are transcribed in the leftward direction, and orf <dig>  orf <dig>  orf <dig>  and orf <dig> are transcribed in the rightward direction.

the 5′ initiation site of orf <dig> is located at nt  <dig> and the termination site is located at nt  <dig>  the coding sequence starts at nt  <dig>  terminates at nt  <dig>  and encodes a protein of  <dig> amino acids. comparison of the deduced n-terminal amino acid sequence of orf <dig> with other proteins using the blast algorithm revealed extensive homology to the n-terminal domain of the pcv <dig> cap protein, although the c-terminal amino acid sequence is low because there has been a frameshift in the orf <dig> 

orf <dig> is initiated at nt  <dig> and terminates at nt  <dig>  the coding sequence starts at nt  <dig>  terminates at nt  <dig>  and completely overlaps orf <dig> transcribed in the opposite direction. the encoded protein has a sequence of  <dig> amino acids, with at least 86% sequence identity with the amino acid sequence of pcv <dig> orf <dig> 

orf <dig> is initiated at nt  <dig> and terminates at nt  <dig>  the coding sequence starts at nt  <dig> and terminates at nt  <dig>  the protein of  <dig> amino acids has at least 91% sequence identity with the amino acid sequence of pcv <dig> orf <dig> 

the 5′ initiation site of orf <dig> is located at nt  <dig> and the termination site is at nt  <dig>  the coding sequence starts at nt  <dig>  terminates at nt  <dig>  and completely overlaps orf <dig> in the same direction. a blast search of the genbank database showed that it shares homology with a putative phosphatase from streptococcus mutans .

orf <dig> is initiated at nt  <dig> and terminates at nt  <dig>  the coding sequence  of orf <dig> is between nt  <dig> and nt  <dig>  a blast search of the genbank database showed that it shares homology with an rna-dependent rna polymerase from a lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus , an enzyme that catalyzes the replication of rna from an rna template.

the 3′ termination sites of orf <dig>  orf <dig>  or orf <dig> are located at nt  <dig> and the 5′ initiation sites of orf <dig>  orf <dig>  and orf <dig> are located at nt  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. in orf <dig>  the coding sequence starts at nt  <dig> and terminates at nt  <dig>  in orf <dig>  the coding sequence starts at nt  <dig> and terminates at nt  <dig>  in orf <dig>  the coding sequence starts at nt  <dig> and terminates at nt  <dig>  the orf <dig>  orf <dig>  and orf <dig> proteins encode nine,  <dig>  and  <dig> amino acids, respectively. a blast search of the genbank database with the deduced orf <dig>  orf <dig>  and orf <dig> amino acid sequences generated too many strong matches to easily determine their functions.

the large number of orf <dig> transcripts suggests that it encodes a structural protein, e.g., a capsid protein. orf <dig> also contains a conserved amino acid sequence at the n-terminus resembling that of a major structural protein of pcv <dig>  so we investigated whether orf <dig> of the p <dig> virus is a structural protein. in this study, a viral structural protein of  <dig>  kda was identified in the purified p <dig> particles, similar to the expressed orf <dig> gene product. these results indicate that orf <dig> encodes a  <dig>  kda protein that is the major structural protein of p <dig> 

all the proteins encoded by the orfs of the p <dig> virus are small proteins, except that encoded by orf <dig>  even the products of orf <dig>  orf <dig>  orf <dig>  orf <dig>  and orf <dig> can be considered peptides. these small proteins are known to participate in a wide variety of cellular processess  <cit> . the discovery and clarification of these small proteins will help to establish the unique roles they play in the host and the virus.

CONCLUSIONS
despite the small genome of the p <dig> virus, its transcriptional pattern is very complex. although it is unclear whether most of these transcripts encode proteins, this study contributes to our knownledge of the biological properties of p <dig>
