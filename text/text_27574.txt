BACKGROUND
sinorhizobium meliloti is a soil bacterium that must survive and proliferate in various adverse conditions. s. meliloti is also able to establish a symbiotic partnership with medicago sativa leading to the formation of nodules. in nodules, the bacterium differentiates in bacteroids and fixes atmospheric nitrogen. within the soil and during nodulation, s. meliloti copes with various stresses imposed by the environment  <cit>  or by plant responses to bacterial invasion  <cit> . while nodulation is a close association between plant and s. meliloti, bacteria are initially recognised as intruders and induce an oxidative burst  <cit> .

an increased production of reactive oxygen species , including superoxides, h2o <dig> and organic hydroperoxides is an important component of plant defences  <cit> . in free living bacteria oxidative stress results from aerobic metabolism  <cit> , ros are produced as a result of the incomplete reduction of molecular oxygen  <cit> . hence, both in free living and symbiotic stages, s. meliloti produces enzymes to detoxify ros. only those that detoxify superoxide anion and h2o <dig> have been studied extensively superoxides are detoxified by two superoxide dismutases  <cit> , h2o <dig> by three catalases   <cit>  and a chloroperoxidase   <cit> . little is known about resistance to organic peroxides  in s. meliloti. ohps are generated as part of the active defence response of plants  <cit> . ohps are highly toxic. they participate in free radical reactions that generate more toxic ros by reacting with membranes and other macromolecules  <cit> . thus, detoxification of ohps is important for bacterial survival and proliferation.

bacteria possess two systems to protect themselves against organic peroxide toxicity. peroxiredoxines have been shown to be the main peroxide detoxification enzymes in eukaryotes and bacteria  <cit> . alkyl hydroperoxidase reductase  constitutes the best characterised member of peroxiredoxin family  <cit> . this enzyme is composed of a reductase subunit and a catalytic subunit reducing organic peroxides to alcohols  <cit> . the second class of ohp detoxification enzymes  is only found in bacteria  <cit> . the ohr  protein first discovered in xanthomonas campestris  <cit> , and osmc   <cit>  are hydroperoxide peroxidases catalysing the reduction of hydroperoxides into their corresponding alcohols  <cit> . both ohr and osmc are structurally and functionally homologous proteins. they are homodimeric with the active sites on either side of the molecule  <cit> . their active sites contain two highly conserved cysteines which are involved in peroxide metabolism  <cit> . despite this conservation of the proteins, osmc and ohr display different patterns of regulation and distinct physiological functions  <cit> . the expression of ohr is specifically induced by organic peroxides and not by ethanol and osmotic stress  <cit> , while osmc is not induced by organic peroxides; instead it is induced by ethanol and osmotic stress and controlled by multiple general stress responsive regulators  <cit> . the inactivation of ohr, but not osmc, reduces the resistance only against organic peroxides, and not to other oxidants  <cit> .

the expression of ohr is regulated by the organic peroxide-inducible transcription repressor ohrr, a member of marr family. structural data are available for ohrr of bacillus subtilis  <cit>  and ohrr of x. campestris  <cit> . ohr functions as a dimeric repressor that binds the ohr promoter region in the absence of organic peroxides. derepression results from the oxidation of a highly conserved active site cysteine that resides near the nh <dig> terminus of the protein  <cit> . b. subtilis ohrr contains only one cysteine; its oxidation leads to the formation of a mixed disulfide with a low molecular weight thiol, a cyclic sulfenamide, or overoxidation to sulfinic or sulfonic acids  <cit> . in other bacteria, like x. campestris, ohrr contains a second cysteine located on the cooh extremity of the ohrr protein . oxidation of the protein initiates by the formation of a sulphenic derivative of the reactive cysteine  followed by the formation of a disulfide bond with c <dig> of the other ohrr subunit  <cit> . while ohr homologues are widely distributed in bacterial genomes  <cit> , the role of ohr and ohrr was only studied in a few number of bacteria: x. campestris, b. subtilis, agrobacterium tumefasciens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptomyces coelicolor  <cit> .

in many bacteria, peroxide stress was studied only via h2o <dig> stress. in s. meliloti, h2o <dig> resistance has been extensively studied  <cit>  while ohp resistance is poorly understood. this study aims at evaluating the role of ohr and ohrr genes on ohp resistance in s. meliloti. the analysis of the biochemical properties of ohr and ohrr mutants and the expression pattern suggests that this system should play an important role in sensing and protection of s. meliloti from ohps.

RESULTS
identification of ohr and ohrr homologues in s. meliloti
blast search of s. meliloti genome for homologues of x. campestris ohr protein revealed two paralogues, sma <dig> and smc <dig>  showing  <dig> and 57% identity respectively with ohr of x. campestris. they possess conserved active site cysteines of ohr/osmc proteins  <cit> . sma <dig> is annotated as osmc. smc <dig> has been shown to be induced by peroxide stress  <cit> ; it is divergently located from a gene encoding a marr family regulator that has  <dig> and 45% identity with the ohrr regulatory protein of x. campestris and b. subtilis respectively. smc <dig> has been previously published as ohrr like repressor since it presents 40% identity with ohrr of x. campestris  <cit> ; the adjacent gene cpo  has been shown to encode a secreted peroxidase.

co-localisation on the genome of ohr and ohrr was found in all bacteria in which these genes were investigated  <cit> , suggesting that smc <dig> and smc <dig> encodes respectively ohr and ohrr proteins.

ohr mutant growth is inhibited by organic peroxides
in order to investigate the role of ohr  and ohrr  in oxidative stress defence, s. meliloti strains with an ohrr deletion or carrying an insertion in ohr were constructed. the ability of these mutants to resist exposure to oxidants was evaluated; neither of the two had any growth defect when grown aerobically in complete medium lb or in minimal medium gas. moreover they possessed the same plating efficiency as wild type strain.

the influence of organic peroxides on growth of wild type, ohr and ohrr strains was analysed by adding increasing amounts of t-butyl hydroperoxide  and cumene hydroperoxide  to lb medium and determining the maximal od <dig> nm reached by the cultures. a concentration of  <dig> mm tbooh abolished the growth of ohr mutant while the growth yield of ohrr and parental strains was unaffected. similarly  <dig>  mm of cuooh abolished growth of ohr strain but did not affect growth yield of ohrr and parental strains.

disk diffusion assays were used to determine if ohr and ohrr mutations affected resistance to ros. the ohr mutant was less resistant than its parental strain when challenged with organic peroxides as shown by the zones of growth inhibition:  <dig>  ±  <dig>  cm for cuooh and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  cm for tbooh versus to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  cm for wild type strain. in contrast, ohrr mutation did not affect the resistance of s. meliloti against tbooh and cuooh since inhibition zones were not significantly  different from those of wild type strain . the ohr-ohrr mutant behaved identically to the ohr mutant .

in other experiments, ohr and ohrr mutants were complemented by the moderate copy number plasmid pbbr1-mcs <dig> bearing wild type alleles of ohr  or ohrr . the empty vector did not affect the resistance of wild type or mutants against tbooh and cuooh. plasmid vector carrying ohrr+ allele also did not affect the resistance to ohps of these three strains. in contrast the introduction of pbbohr in ohr mutant dramatically improved resistance to both tbooh and cuooh . these results showed that ohr is important in the defence against organic peroxides in s. meliloti.

in comparison with parental strain, ohr and ohrr mutants were not significantly affected in resistance to h2o <dig> and menadione; inhibition zones were nearly identical for the three strains. no alteration of this resistance was observed after complementation of the mutations with pbbohr or pbbohrr. this result agrees with the role of ohr in other organisms and its specificity for organic peroxide resistance.

regulation of ohr and ohrr genes
the transcriptional activity of ohr and ohrr genes was assayed in strain r <dig>  carrying ohr::lacz and ohrr::uida transcriptional fusions in tandem with wild type copies of ohr and ohrr genes.

the expression of these fusions was analysed in lb medium and in the minimal medium gas. no difference was observed between both media. the expression of ohr::lacz and ohrr::uida was followed throughout growth till the late stationary growth phase. the expression of these two genes remained constant; no variation was observed after growth arrest. adding nacl to the medium during exponential growth or during stationary growth phase did not affect ohr or ohrr expression . such a result is expected for ohr and clearly differentiates it from osmc proteins that are induced by nacl  <cit> .

the influence of peroxides was analysed by introducing into the medium a concentration of peroxide that did not affect the development of exponentially growing cells. expression of ohr was induced 4-fold in the presence of  <dig>  mm tbooh, a 7-fold induction was observed with  <dig>  mm cuooh. the addition of  <dig> mm h2o <dig> resulted in a 2-fold induction of ohr .

induction of ohrr was also observed when cultures were exposed to tbooh and cuooh, induction ratios were lower than those observed for ohr gene. in contrast h2o <dig> did not affect ohrr expression .

ohrr regulates ohr expression
a plasmid bearing ohr::lacz transcriptional fusion  was introduced into the ohrr mutant and the parental strain. the expression of the fusion was analysed in lb medium in the absence of organic peroxides and  <dig> h after  <dig>  mm cuooh addition. in the absence of peroxide, the expression of ohr::lacz fusion was greater in the ohrr mutant than in the wild type strain . after cuooh addition, the expression of ohr::lacz was similar in ohrr mutant and parental strain . these results are in accordance with repression of ohr promoter by the ohrr regulator.

ohrr binds to ohr-ohrr intergenic region
the binding of ohrr to ohr-ohrr intergenic region was analysed by gel mobility shift assay. in a first attempt, a  <dig> bp dna fragment encompassing the entire ohr-ohrr intergenic region and ended at the initiation codons of ohr and ohrr, was used as a probe . two retarded bands were observed in the presence of ohrr . the intergenic region between smb <dig> and smb <dig>  was used as a negative control. no specific binding of ohrr protein to this dna fragment was observed .

we took advantage of restriction sites located within the ohr-ohrr intergenic region to define further ohrr binding site. apoi cleaved once this fragment giving a  <dig> bp and a  <dig> bp fragment. in the presence of ohrr protein the longer fragment produced two shifted bands . two hpaii sites are located within ohr-ohrr intergenic region; hpaii cleavage produced three fragments of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bp. in the presence of ohrr, the intensity of the  <dig> bp fragment decreased and two retarded bands were observed . thus ohrr binding sites are located within the  <dig> bp hpaii fragment. none of the dna fragments generated by bsshii  or msei  were shifted in the presence of ohrr . the unique bsshii and both msei sites are located within the  <dig> bp hpaii region, which suggests that ohrr binding site is located within the  <dig> bp msei fragment or overlaps its extremities and overlaps the bsshii site.

two imperfect palindroms  are located within the  <dig> bp hpaii region. moreover msei and bsshii sites overlap these motifs. motif  <dig>  and motif  <dig>  look like the ohrr binding site gcaatt-aattcg found in other bacteria  <cit> . motif  <dig> and motif  <dig> are adjacent as observed for ohrr binding sites of b. subtilis  <cit> , a. tumefaciens  <cit> , s. coelicolor  <cit>  and x. campestris  <cit> .

to further analyse ohrr binding,  <dig> bp dna fragments containing in their centre  <dig> nt corresponding either to motif  <dig> or motif  <dig> were synthesised. the ohrr protein was found to bind to both fragments. mutations were introduced in motif  <dig> to confirm the importance of this sequence. the modification of gc to aa or aaa to ccc in one half of the palindrome abolishes the binding of ohrr to the dna fragments .

modulation of ohrr activity by oxidation
s. meliloti ohrr protein contains two cysteine residues conserved at the same position than in ohrr of x. campestris, allowing the possibility to form inter-subunit disulfide bonds upon oxidation.

purified ohrr was treated with cuooh, h2o <dig> or dtt and the products were analysed by non reducing sds-page . in the presence of dtt, s. meliloti ohrr protein migrated as a band of an apparent mw of  <dig> kda . incubation of the protein with cuooh or h2o <dig> led to the formation of a band of  <dig> kda corresponding to the dimeric form. the formation of the dimer was reversed by an excess of dtt. thus, as observed in x. campestris  <cit> , the oxidation of ohrr induces a reversible bonding between the two subunits of the protein .

binding of ohrr to ohr-ohrr intergenic region was suppressed when  <dig> mm h2o <dig> was added to the binding mixture. binding was recovered after addition of an excess of dtt. thus only the reduced form of ohrr was able to bind dna .

ohr strain forms fix+ nodules in alfalfa
the sensitivity of s. meliloti ohr mutants to ohps is potentially relevant to symbiosis since legume root cells respond to rhizobial infection with an enhanced production of ros  <cit> . to test the effect of ohr mutation on nodulation and nitrogen fixation, one week old seedlings of medicago sativa were inoculated with either the s. meliloti ohr mutant or the parental strain. plants were grown in nitrogen-deprived medium. five weeks after the inoculation, plants were visually screened for nodulation by observing the root system. a highly efficient nodulation was observed on plants inoculated with either ohr or parental strains. no significant difference between dry weights of plant shoots was observed. the inoculated plants had green leaves and comparable number of nodules, whereas the non-inoculated control plants were smaller, with yellow leaves and significantly lower dry weight. nodules from plants inoculated with the ohr mutant were crushed and the bacteria recovered by plating on msy plates before assayed for gentamycine resistance and ohp sensitivity. all the randomly selected colonies that were analysed were able to grow on gentamycine-containing plates and behaved like the original ohr mutant. thus n2-fixing nodules formed on alfalfa were due to infection by the ohr mutant and not by revertants.

in order to analyse ohr and ohrr expression in planta, β-galactosidase and β-glucuronidase activity were visualised by light microscopy on entire and sections of nodules from r <dig>   infected plants . no staining was observed in root hairs or infection threads. nodule staining co localises with pink coloration of leghemoglobin, corresponding to nitrogen fixation zone . thus, in spite of the absence of a nodulation defect of ohr strain, both ohr and ohrr genes were expressed during nodulation. this result is in accordance with the detection of ohr protein in nodules in proteomic studies  <cit> .

discussion
in this study, we analysed the role of ohr and ohrr genes in s. meliloti. as many bacteria, s. meliloti must survive oxidative stress generated by the environment or during symbiosis. ros attack of cellular membranes generates a cascade of radicals leading to the formation of ohps  <cit> . moreover, ohps are produced by plants as part of the defence response against bacteria  <cit> . organic peroxides are potent effectors of ohr system in bacteria  <cit> .

ohr is not essential for nodulation. bacteria containing ohr mutations formed effective nodules, suggesting that s. meliloti does not undergo ohp stress during nodulation or that other enzymes detoxify ohp like ahpc  as described in x. campestris  <cit> . the redundancy of enzymatic activities was also described for catalases in s. meliloti; only strains affected at least for two catalases are compromised in symbiosis  <cit> . both ohr and ohrr are specifically induced by ohps and are expressed in nodules but no ohp detection was reported, so we could not exclude the existence of other compounds inducing ohr and ohrr.

like in many bacteria, ohr is located at the immediate vicinity of its regulator: ohrr . this orf encodes a regulatory protein of the marr family as all known ohrr regulators. the regulator ohrr is a dimeric regulatory protein that senses organic peroxides. two families of ohrr proteins exist; they are exemplified by ohrr of b. subtilis and ohrr of x. campestris. these two proteins share 40% amino acid identity and are structurally similar  <cit> . nevertheless, they differ in their peroxide sensing mechanisms. the b. subtilis ohrr protein family contains only one cysteine residue. depending on the oxidant, ohrr gives reversible oxidised derivatives or functions as a sacrificial regulator  <cit> . the x. campestris ohrr possesses another important cysteine . the initially oxidized cysteine  forms intersubunits disulfide bonds with the residue c <dig> on the second subunit of the dimer, leading to reversible inactivation of the protein  <cit> . the introduction of a second cysteine into b. subtilis ohrr  allows b. subtilis ohrr to function as x. campestris ohrr, protecting the protein against irreversible oxidation in presence of strong oxidants  <cit> . comparison of s. meliloti ohrr protein with that of b. subtilis and x. campestris shows that s. meliloti protein keeps similar amino acid identity with both proteins . s. meliloti possesses two cysteines at the same position than ohrr of x. campestris. we observed that protein oxidation led to the formation of a dimer and loss of dna binding, these phenomena are reversed by dtt in vitro. thus s. meliloti ohrr oxidation mechanism is similar to that described for ohrr of x. campestris.

the expression of ohr and ohrr was assayed at the transcriptional level. their expression was constant throughout growth and no induction during stationary growth phase was observed. similarly, osmotic stress did not induce ohr or ohrr expression. these observations match with the expression of these genes in x. campestris, a. tumefasciens, b. subtilis, p. aeruginosa and s. coelicolor  <cit> . as previously observed in these bacteria, ohr and ohrr genes of s. meliloti were induced by tbooh and cuooh. h2o <dig> was a poor inducer of ohr gene in s. meliloti. induction of ohr by h2o <dig> in other bacteria is contradictory. western analysis and gene fusion assays showed that ohr is not induced by h2o <dig> in a. tumefasciens, b. subtilis, p. aeruginosa and s. coelicolor  <cit>  and only x. campestris ohr is slightly induced by h2o <dig>  <cit> . transcriptomic studies of h2o <dig> stress response in b. subtilis  <cit>  and p. aeruginosa  <cit>  showed in contrast an ohr induction.

induction of ohr requires the oxidation of ohrr. we observed that s. meliloti ohrr is oxidized by h2o <dig> in vitro and did not bind to the operator when incubated with h2o <dig>  nevertheless, h2o <dig> is a poor inducer of ohr in vivo and is not an inducer of ohrr expression. h2o <dig> also causes a loss of b. subtilis ohrr binding to ohra promoter in vitro while in vivo derepression of ohra upon exposure to h2o <dig> was not observed  <cit> . the role of h2o <dig> in alfalfa during symbiosis is not restricted to plant defence against bacteria. it is also important for symbiotic process  <cit> . h2o <dig> is necessary for cell wall formation and infection thread rigidity  <cit> . production of h2o <dig> was detected in root hairs, infection threads, infection and senescence zones but not in fixing zone  <cit> . the expression of ohr and ohrr was detected only in nitrogen fixing zone, thus they are not expressed constitutively and they are not induced by h2o <dig> in planta. these data suggest that organic peroxides are produced in nodules so that ohr protein plays a role during nitrogen fixation.

CONCLUSIONS
resistance to organic hydroperoxides has not been previously analysed in s. meliloti. we have demonstrated that ohr protein is essential for s. meliloti to survive organic peroxide stress. the expression of ohr and ohrr genes in nodules suggests that the ohr protein participates in organic peroxides detoxification within the nodule.
