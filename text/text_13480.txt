BACKGROUND
bacterial pathogens can sense a variety of physical and chemical niche-specific cues enabling them to physiologically adapt and modulate virulence to survive and cause disease. to enable successful host-pathogen interactions it is increasingly recognised that bacteria must also respond to a diverse range of host effector molecules. the term "microbial endocrinology" was first used to describe the interactions of microbes with the neuroendocrine environment of their host  <cit> . catecholamine hormones like adrenaline and noradrenaline are released in the bloodstream and are involved in the regulation of a wide variety of host physiological processes. current data suggests that catecholamines can induce dna damage via production of hydroxyl radicals in the presence of iron  <cit> . more recently, adrenaline was implicated in the production of hydroxyl radicals in rat hepatocytes via an adrenoreceptor-mediated mechanism  <cit> .

there is evidence that non-neural cells like peripheral human t lymphocytes contain and are able to synthesize catecholamines from normal precursors in physiologic concentrations  <cit> . recently, bacterial lipopolysaccharide has been shown to induce production and release of adrenaline and noradrenaline by macrophages and neutrophils  <cit> . it was therefore suggested that the phagocytic system represents a diffusely expressed adrenergic organ  <cit> .

both adrenaline and noradrenaline are present in the gastrointestinal system where they mediate normal gut physiology  <cit> . during infection, plasma levels of catecholamines rise in an increase previously associated with the onset of infection  <cit> . there is evidence to suggest that general stress can alter levels of these hormones in the gut and could act as an environmental cue for pathogens  <cit> .

indeed, catecholamines have been shown to induce both gram negative and gram positive bacterial growth via the provision of iron  <cit> . noradrenaline affects production of the k <dig> pilus adhesin of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and also shiga toxin in e. coli o157:h <dig> thus influencing the virulence fitness of these pathogens  <cit> .

although catecholamines represent a eukaryotic cell signal to mediate a concerted organ function, bacteria utilise a different form of communication mediated by small molecules termed "autoinducers" in a process called "quorum sensing"  <cit> . briefly, bacteria produce and sense autoinducers  in a concentration-dependent fashion. upon achievement of a critical concentration of autoinducer, a signal is generated to regulate processes such as bioluminescence, antibiotic biosynthesis, plasmid conjugation, biofilm formation, dna uptake competence, sporulation, and virulence  <cit> . recently, a novel autoinducer, ai- <dig>  produced by e. coli and other gram negative bacteria was shown to act in synergy with adrenaline and noradrenaline to regulate e. coli genes involved in motility and virulence independently of enterobactin-mediated iron transport  <cit> . furthermore, α adrenergic antagonists were able to block these interactions suggesting sensory transduction through common receptors  <cit> .

in this report we dissect the global effects of adrenaline on the salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium  transcriptome. our data show that approximately  <dig> % of the transcriptome of the pathogen is significantly regulated by adrenaline. most of the genes affected represent those involved in transport but we also see alterations in genes encoding proteins of unknown functions. we also notice changes in levels of regulators and signal transduction genes.

the major feature of the s. typhimurium adrenaline response is the upregulation of genes involved in metal homeostasis and oxidative stress. prompted by the transcriptomic data we investigated the expression of the manganese superoxide dismutase , and the regulators of iron homeostasis  and oxidative stress . our evidence suggests that adrenaline provides an environmental cue to alert s. typhimurium against impending macrophage-derived peroxide stress as shown by the reduced ability of s. typhimurium lacking oxyr to survive in the presence of adrenaline.

furthermore we identified a downregulation of the pmrhfijklm operon which encodes a well characterised lipid a-modification system that provides resistance to the cationic antimicrobial peptide polymyxin b. we investigated the expression of the pmr locus and suggest adrenaline-mediated reduction in antimicrobial peptide resistance is mediated by the bassr two component signal transduction system.

the fact that adrenaline provides an environmental cue that alerts the bacterial defences against oxidative stress as well as acting in favour of the host by inducing a reduction in bacterial antimicrobial peptide resistance is a unique combination. this finding represents a novel insight concerning the role of hormones in pathogen-host interactions.

 restriction endonuclease sites are in bold.

transcriptomics experimental design and methodology
rna was isolated from cultures according to protocols described on the ifr microarray web site . briefly, two od units of culture was fixed by incubation on ice with a 1/ <dig> culture volume of 5% phenol and 95% ethanol to immediately stop rna transcription or degradation. cultures were centrifuged at  <dig>  rpm for  <dig> minutes, and the resulting pellets were frozen at -80°c. rna was subsequently isolated using an sv total rna system  following the protocols provided by the manufacturer. the quality of the rna was verified using an agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer , and the quantity was determined with an nd- <dig> spectrophotometer . microarray hybridisation and scanning were performed at the institute of food research,  norwich as described previously  <cit>  and according to protocols described on the ifr microarray web site . briefly, rna samples  from three biological replicates and two technical replicates were labelled with cy5-dctp and hybridized to the ifr salsa microarrays. cy3-dctp-labeled s. typhimurium genomic dna was used as a common reference in an indirect comparison type experimental design  <cit> . the ifr salsa microarrays comprise  <dig> genes from  <dig> different serovars of salmonella .

transcriptomics data analysis validation and in silico informatics
microarrays were scanned and fluorescence intensities quantified using genepix pro software, version  <dig>  . microarray features showing a reference signal lower than background plus  <dig> standard deviations were discarded. unequal dye incorporation was compensated by median centering . transcriptomic data from adrenaline containing lb cultures was normalised to data from lb cultures without adrenaline and significant differences at p ≤  <dig>  were determined using a parametric-based statistical test by adjusting the individual p-value with the benjamini and hochberg false discovery rate multiple test correction  <cit> . all expression data for genes discussed in the text have passed this filter and are therefore statistically significant. these tests are features of the genespring™  <dig>   microarray analysis software package which was used for both data visualisation and analysis. the analysis was based on statistically significant differences displaying greater than  <dig>  fold changes between lb cultures with and without adrenaline. in general transcriptomic data are filtered to only include equal to or greater than 2-fold differences, however less than 2-fold changes can also be biologically significant  <cit> .

construction of expression vectors
the luxcdabe operon was amplified by pcr from psb <dig> using primers lux <dig> and lux <dig> . the pcr product containing an engineered multiple cloning site  upstream of the lux operon was then ecori/eagi digested and ligated to ecori/eagi-cut pbr <dig> giving rise to pmk1lux. promoters were cloned using the ecori and bamhi restriction sites of the mcs of pmk1lux. for a list of promoter primers and plasmid constructs see table  <dig>

measurement of total fe
this was done as described by velayudhan et al., , with some modifications  <cit> . bacteria were grown overnight in lb , then subcultured in  <dig> ml fresh lb and grown at 37°c,  <dig> rpm for  <dig> h. adrenaline , propranolol  or h2o was added and incubation was continued for an additional  <dig> h. cells were harvested, washed twice in  <dig> ml of  <dig> mm edta, ph  <dig>  and twice in  <dig> ml of analytical grade water . the od <dig> and the volume of the cell suspension in the last wash were recorded. the final cell pellet was weighed and then solubilised by resuspending in  <dig>  ml of 30% ultra-pure nitric acid at 80°c for  <dig> h. the volume was increased to  <dig> ml with water before analysis by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy  using a unicam  <dig> series emission spectrometer . five replicas per condition were carried out. standard error bars are shown.

antimicrobial peptide assay
cells were evaluated for their ability to resist killing by the antimicrobial peptide polymyxin b. this was done as described by fields et al. , with some modifications  <cit> . bacteria exposed to adrenaline , propranolol  or water were aliquoted in a 96-well plate at a concentration of  <dig> ×  <dig> to  <dig> ×  <dig> bacteria per well, in  <dig> μl of a solution containing  <dig> % tryptone and  <dig> % sodium chloride. a  <dig> μl volume of antimicrobial peptide was added  and the plate was incubated at 37°c,  <dig> rpm for  <dig> h. samples were collected and viable counts performed by plating out different dilutions on lb plates. data are presented as colony forming units and represent the average of three independent experiments.

RESULTS
microarray analysis of salmonella adrenaline transcriptome
during infection bacteria come into contact with a wide range of host-derived molecules ranging from very small molecular weight compounds to peptides and proteins. adrenaline is produced by the host in specialised organ tissues  <cit> . recently it was shown that phagocytes and polymorphonuclear cells are capable of de novo production of catecholamines, and when exposed to lipopolysaccharide in vitro they release noradrenaline and adrenaline  <cit> . these findings stimulated our interest in investigating the effects of adrenaline on s. enterica serovar typhimurium. we used adrenaline at the concentration of  <dig> μm to reflect experiments previously performed by others  <cit>  and sampled at  <dig> minutes post-addition.

the transcriptomic data showed that the addition of adrenaline leads to a significant regulation  of  <dig> genes with alterations ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  fold . interestingly, more that 52% of the adrenaline-regulated genes were involved in transport and metabolism and approximately a third encoded proteins of unknown function .

the majority of the upregulated genes encoded components involved in iron transport, microcin, and oxidative stress resistance. most of the genes displaying decreased expression levels belonged to the bassr-regulated pmrhfijklm operon which encodes a lipid a modification system  <cit> .

among the downregulated genes was flgd, encoding a flagellar basal body rod modification protein, and invf, involved in salmonella pathogenicity island  <dig>  mediated type  <dig> secretion . we did not observe a significant difference in s. typhimurium motility or the spi- <dig> mediated t3s secreted protein profile during exposure to adrenaline . however in e. coli, studies performed to assess the role of catecholamines on the transcriptome have revealed significant changes in both motility and t3s genes  <cit> . this may reflect important biological differences between the two organisms under the conditions tested. in agreement with our observations these studies also identified upregulation of iron transport genes.

the transcriptomic results were validated by qpcr  and also by the use of luminescent transcriptional reporters and a range of phenotypic screens. we constructed promoter transcriptional fusions to investigate the oxidative stress response using soda  and the antimicrobial peptide resistance pmr operon  as described below.

transport systems affected by adrenaline in salmonella
the majority of adrenaline-regulated genes are involved in metal transport, uptake of siderophores and microcins . fhua and fhuc encode components of the hydroxamate-dependent iron transport system in salmonella spp. and are also the receptors for microcin j <dig>  <cit> . microcin j <dig> stimulates the production of reactive oxygen species such as superoxide ion  in bacterial cells, leading to damage via perturbation of the membrane respiratory chain  <cit> . in e. coli the ferric hydroxamate uptake receptor fhua transports siderophores in a tonb-dependent manner  <cit> . the exbbd system, participating in the tonb-dependent uptake of microcin j <dig> in e. coli and responsible for enterochelin and b colicin uptake  <cit>  is also significantly upregulated. induction of such systems may provide a valuable insight into the way adrenaline affects bacterial physiology to modulate host-pathogen interactions during infection.

two additional systems involved in manganese, sitab and iron transport, feoab,  <cit>  are also upregulated by adrenaline. the sitabcd locus encodes an important transporter of manganese and iron which is required for resistance to h2o <dig> and for full virulence of s. typhimurium in animals  <cit> . sita is also required for salmonella spp. virulence in macrophages by facilitating manganese transport  <cit> . bacterial accumulation of manganese forms the basis for an alternative catalytic detoxification of reactive oxygen species, the exact mechanism of which is not yet completely understood  <cit> . we hypothesise that intracellular manganese accumulation reflected an adrenaline-induced mechanism to aid pathogen survival. the downregulation of the s. typhimurium ftn gene encoding a ferritin involved in iron storage  <cit> , may mirror the perturbation in the general metal pool during exposure to adrenaline.

the superoxide dismutase, soda, gene is also significantly upregulated by adrenaline . the s. typhimurium manganese-cofactored superoxide dismutase  is involved in resistance to the early oxygen-dependent microbicidal mechanisms of phagocytes  <cit> . using a luminescent soda transcriptional reporter we observed a slight  but significant  increase in soda expression supporting the transcriptomic results and also highlighting the presence of increased oxidative stress by exposure to adrenaline . the effect was not blocked by addition of β-adrenergic blocker propranolol . we used a s. typhimurium strain lacking soda  to further characterise the importance of the superoxide dismutase in the response to adrenaline. we did not observe a significant change in the numbers of bacteria surviving exposure to  <dig> μm adrenaline when compared to the wild type sl <dig>  suggesting that soda is not essential for survival during exposure to adrenaline .

the above s. typhimurium transcriptional signature suggests a dual role for adrenaline. on the one hand, by inducing iron uptake systems, it serves as a warning probing the bacteria to adjust their metal ion transport in such a way as to resist looming oxidative stress but, on the other hand, facilitating increased susceptibility to microcin assault by increasing microcin j <dig> receptor content.

oxyr and not fur is essential for survival during adrenaline exposure
oxidative stress resistance in bacterial cells is mediated by enzymatic as well as non-enzymatic methods involving manganese  <cit> . oxyr is a positive regulator of a range of genes implicated in resistance to hydrogen peroxide  <cit> . fur fine-tunes the regulation of iron homeostasis by controlling iron transport  <cit> . having observed a significant upregulation of iron and manganese transporter genes by adrenaline, we examined the importance of fur and oxyr during salmonella exposure to adrenaline. exposure of sl <dig> fur to  <dig> μm adrenaline had no effect on its ability to grow in rich growth media suggesting fur-mediated functions are not important in the adrenaline response . however, sl1344oxyr survived significantly less in the presence of adrenaline when compared to wild type sl <dig> with the phenotype being blockable by the addition of the β-adrenergic blocker propranolol . to test if the effect was due to the ability of adrenaline to bind iron we treated sl1344oxyr with metanephrine, a natural methylated metabolite of adrenaline which is unable to bind iron  <cit> . addition of  <dig> μm metanephrine had no significant effect on the survival of sl1344oxyr supporting the role of adrenaline-bound iron in reducing the viability of the strain .

manganese rescues oxyr in the presence of adrenaline
we tested the ability of manganese to improve survival of sl1344oxyr treated with adrenaline by supplementing the growth medium with the metal. addition of  <dig> mm manganese fully restored bacterial survival back to wild type levels in sl1344oxyr treated with  <dig> μm adrenaline . the importance of manganese in alleviating the oxidative stress effect in cells is related to its ability to reduce the effects of the fenton reaction involving intracellular iron  <cit> . by a mechanism not fully elucidated yet, manganese acts as a natural free radical detoxifying agent reacting with superoxide and also hydrogen peroxide.

measurement of the total metal ion concentration in cells treated with  <dig> μm adrenaline as well as in the oxyr strain supports the hypothesis that adrenaline induces oxidative stress by promoting an increase in the intracellular iron concentration . we observe a 4-fold increase in the total iron concentration of cells treated with  <dig> μm adrenaline when compared to the water-treated control . furthermore, addition of β-adrenergic blocker propranolol blocks the adrenaline-mediated increase in the total iron concentration . sl1344oxyr has significantly increased total iron and reduced total manganese concentration when compared to sl <dig> . this fact in conjunction with the adrenaline-induced increase in intracellular iron may explain the reduced viability of sl1344oxyr upon adrenaline treatment and subsequent rescuing of viability with manganese . however, the role of propranolol in rescuing sl1344oxyr during exposure to adrenaline may be independent of manganese. this is highlighted by the reduction  in total manganese levels upon exposure to propranolol.

adrenaline may therefore induce oxidative stress via an oxyr-dependent pathway in a manner reversible by the β-adrenergic blocker propranolol and also by the non-enzymatic manganese-based oxidative stress detoxification system.

adrenaline reduces expression of the pmr locus and increases sensitivity to polymyxin b
lipid a is a structural component of the lipopolysaccharide  in the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria and plays an important role in bacterial pathogenesis  <cit> . polymyxin b, is a cationic antimicrobial peptide which binds to lipid a and damages the cell envelope  <cit> . resistance to antimicrobial peptides has been shown to contribute to persistence of s. typhimurium in a variety of niches ranging from the phagosomes within macrophages to the c. elegans intestine  <cit> . the pmrhfijklm operon encodes a set of proteins involved in lipopolysaccharide modification and resistance to the cationic antimicrobial polypeptide polymyxin b  <cit> . the resistance mechanism involves attachment of phosphoethanolamine and 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose moieties on lipid a reducing its net negative charge and limiting its interaction with polymyxin  <cit> . in s. typhimurium, the pmr locus is under the control of the bassr two component system  <cit> .

to further elucidate the effect of adrenaline on the pmr operon we constructed a transcriptional reporter fusion driving expression of the luxcdabe operon under the control of the pmr promoter. addition of adrenaline significantly  reduced expression from the pmr promoter mirroring the array results . the transcriptional downregulation of the pmr locus by adrenaline was fully reversible by the β-adrenergic blocker propranolol .

we hypothesised that a reduction in expression of the pmr locus would lead to increased sensitivity to the antimicrobial peptide polymyxin b. we tested the effect of adrenaline on the ability of salmonella to resist polymyxin b by incubating salmonella exposed to water or adrenaline to the antimicrobial peptide as detailed in "methods and materials". pre-treatment of salmonella with  <dig> μm adrenaline resulted in a significant reduction in bacterial survival during exposure to polymyxin b when compared to the water treated control . the adrenaline-induced reduction in the ability of salmonella to resist polymyxin b was also fully reversible by the β-adrenergic blocker propranolol .

the above data show a direct and reversible reduction of bacterial antimicrobial peptide resistance by a mammalian hormone and hence a novel "antibacterial" role for adrenaline. however, we note that salmonella may have adapted to this negative effect of adrenaline within mammalian hosts by increasing lipid a deacylation and palmitoylation, thus favouring survival via reduced tlr- <dig> receptor-based bacterial signalling  <cit> .

adrenaline-induced sensitivity to polymyxin b may be mediated via the bassr two component system
in enterohemorrhagic e. coli o157:h <dig> the qsebc two component system senses adrenaline and is required for full virulence in a rabbit animal model  <cit> . the e. coli response to adrenaline was shown to be blockable by an α-adrenergic antagonist  <cit> . in s. typhimurium the bassr two component system controls expression of the pmr locus and is implicated in the regulation of various other genes  <cit> . the identity at the amino acid level between the bass and qsec sensor kinases is 31% . based on this similarity and also on the observed effects of adrenaline on the pmr operon, we chose to further investigate the role of the sensory protein bass in the mediation of the adrenaline response.

we constructed a s. typhimurium sl <dig> strain lacking the membrane sensor kinase bass  and tested its ability to survive polymyxin b in the presence or absence of adrenaline. survival of sl1344bass was significantly reduced  in the presence of polymyxin b due to downregulation of the pmr locus as previously published  <cit>  . levels of polymyxin b resistance in water-treated sl1344bass were very similar to those observed in adrenaline-treated wild type sl <dig>  furthermore, although addition of the β-adrenergic blocker propranolol significantly improved the survival of sl <dig> to polymyxin b during exposure to adrenaline, survival of sl1344bass remained unaffected by the β-adrenergic blocker .

the above data support the hypothesis that adrenaline exerts its effect on the pmr locus via the reversible interaction of the β-adrenergic blocker with the bass membrane sensor in a manner similar to the interaction of adrenaline with qsec in e. coli. the low  amino acid sequence identity between bass and qsec may provide a clue as to why we observe β-blockage in salmonella as opposed to α-blockage in e. coli.

CONCLUSIONS
bacterial-host communication is increasingly being recognised as important in determining the outcome of infection. it is clear that bacterial pathogens encounter a wide range of host milieus, within which they must survive to successfully colonise and cause disease. salmonella can replicate and survive within the harsh environment of the macrophage  <cit> . our transcriptomic approach has revealed the response of salmonella to adrenaline highlighting its dual role in mediating host-bacterial interactions. systemic or macrophage produced adrenaline may therefore regulate the fine balance between the host and salmonella defence mechanisms, and impact upon the development of disease.
