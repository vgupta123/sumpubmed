BACKGROUND
plants continuously experience variations in environmental conditions on short  and long time scales . short term responses to dynamic environments require strict physiological regulation and are known as phenotypic plasticity. on evolutionary timescales, responses to a specific environment may result in adaptation to local environment through genetic differentiation of populations, which is known as local adaptation  <cit> . as a consequence of local adaptation, plant populations frequently show the best growth performance or fitness in  <cit>  or next to their habitat of origin  <cit>  and outperform populations from distant habitats  <cit> . potential genomic targets of adaptation to climate have been identified by linking single nucleotide polymorphisms  to local climate  or by identification of associations among snps and traits that are known to co-vary with climatic clines, e.g. bud set and cold resistance , carbon isotope discrimination  or cold hardiness .

with respect to the anticipated rapidly changing climate  <cit> , forest trees, which have long generation times, need to adjust their metabolism in response to changing abiotic factors  <cit> . global transcriptome analysis has been extensively used in studies with highly controlled conditions to characterize plasticity and diversity of gene expression metabolism in response to abiotic factors among different populations  and pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca  diverged about  <dig> million years ago  <cit>  and cover a wide natural range with contrasting environmental conditions along the pacific coast and the rocky mountains, respectively. local adaptation of douglas-fir populations growing in defined geographical areas  has been shown in several studies  <cit> . these characteristics make douglas-fir an ideal model organism to study the effect of local adaptation on transcriptome responses to environmental conditions.

in this study we aimed to 1) identify transcriptome dynamics in field-grown adult douglas-fir trees in response to temperature, water availability and photoperiod, 2) use overrepresentation analysis to reveal common functional themes in gene sets that respond to environmental factors, and 3) evaluate differences in transcriptome dynamics between provenances.

for this purpose we compared 50-year-old trees of two divergent douglas-fir provenances originating from contrasting environments in british columbia, canada at two contrasting common garden field-sites in southern germany. to our knowledge, this is the first genome wide assessment of the effect of abiotic environmental factors on the transcriptome responses of heterogeneous, locally adapted populations of mature trees, grown in contrasting natural environments.

variance components contributing to put expression variation
in a first step we used a linear variance components model to estimate the contribution of the environment and the genotype to the variation in put expression. expression variation driven by environment was investigated between the eight sampling time points across the two field sites  and between two field-sites . expression variation driven by genotype was investigated between provenances  and between individual trees . the log-transformed number of reads that aligned to each put was used as the dependent variable in  <dig> linear random effects models . for 25 % of all puts, at least 40 % of the variation in put expression was explained by tree followed by date  and provenance  . the least contribution to the variation in put expression was attributed to the field site .fig.  <dig> variance components of biological and environmental factors. proportion of total expression variation attributable to provenances , field sites , individual trees  sampling time point  for all detected  <dig> puts. a linear random effects model that comprises all above mentioned random effects was fit to all puts using the r package lme <dig>  variance components for each random effect were extracted and divided by the sum of all variance components and the residual variance



detection of differentially expressed puts between provenances and in response to environmental variation
the effect of environment , genotype  represented by provenance, or their interaction  on put expression was further investigated using linear mixed models . this analysis identified  <dig> puts that were differentially expressed between the two provenances ,  <dig> differentially expressed puts between sampling time-points , and  <dig> puts that were affected by the interaction of provenance and environment  .fig.  <dig> differentially expressed puts between provenances and sampling time-points. number of puts that are differentially expressed  between sampling time-points  or provenances and number of puts with significant interaction of provenances and sampling time-points



assuming that date integrates the effects of temperature, day length and water availability on put expression, we further analysed the direct effects of these environmental factors on put expression using a second set of linear mixed models . these models comprised proxies for temperature, day length and water availability. since absolute temperature data were correlated with day length, temperature was detrended by subtracting the four weak running average from air temperature on the day of sampling resulting in the new variable temperature. day length was represented as deviation of photo period from the length of the day at solstice  and total available soil water  was modeled using the forest water model wbs <dig> . we inspected correlation of all variables  and observed no strong correlation between temperature, daylength and taw. however site was strongly correlated with taw  and since the variance components analysis revealed that not much expression variance can be attributed to differences between the field sites  site was omitted from this second set of models.fig.  <dig> effects of environmental factors on put expression. x-y plots show soil water availability  temperature  and day length  during the course of the year. the corresponding bar plots show the values of the respective regressors taw, temperature and daylength that were used in the linear models. red and blue lines indicate the sampling time point in the common gardens in wiesloch and schluchsee, respectively. curves were smoothed using loess transformation. temperature shown in the bar plot  was centered to a 4 week running average while day length  was centered to the maximum day length of the year. day length in may was transformed to positive values to mimic the directed developmental processes occurring during a growing period. d standardized expression of puts that are significantly responding to taw, temperature or daylength in salmon arm  and cameron lake  relative to the environmental parameters



taw  was generally lower at the field site wiesloch during all sampling time-points  and low taw was often accompanied by higher temperature . the highest temperatures at both sites were recorded in july, when temperature exceeded the four week average by 7 °c in wiesloch. daylength in september did contrast with may, june and july, with day length in september being 3–4 h shorter than during may, june and july .

further analysis of the puts that responded to taw, temperature or daylength revealed the expression profile in response to each of the environmental factors . the relationship of expression levels of puts to any of the three environmental factors indicated a highly coordinated response over the entire range of taw, temperature or daylength . the expression profile of puts with a positive response clearly contrasted with the expression profile of puts with a negative response to each of the environmental factors. increases in taw corresponded with an increased expression of  <dig> puts  and a decreased expression of  <dig> puts. when temperature increased, we observed increased expression of  <dig> puts versus  <dig> puts showing the opposite response. an increase in daylength corresponded with increased expression of  <dig> puts compared to  <dig> puts with decreased expression.

the specific response to environmental factors  was also reflected by only  <dig> puts out of the more than 12 k differentially expressed puts that were effected by more than one environmental factor .fig.  <dig> variation in expression response to environment among provenances. a number of puts that are differentially expressed between provenances or responding to temperature, daylength or taw. b expression variation among provenances of puts that respond to environmental factors or are differentially expressed between provenances compared to all detected puts. c expression variation among trees of puts that respond to environmental factors or are differentially expressed between provenances compared to all detected puts. the red line in b and c indicates the median of expression variation in all detected puts. numbers at the whiskers of each box plot indicate the number of puts within a category



in addition to the low number of puts with provenance by environment interaction, only  <dig> puts out of the  <dig> puts that were differentially expressed between provenances were also differentially expressed in response to at least one of the three environmental factors included in our analysis . this set of  <dig> puts included  <dig> puts differentially expressed between provenances and in response to daylength,  <dig> puts differentially expressed between provenances and in response to taw, and  <dig> puts differentially expressed between provenance and in response to temperature.

the low number of puts that responded to climate and were differentially expressed between provenances coincided with reduced expression variation of these puts among provenances  and trees . this effect is particularly pronounced for puts that responded to temperature.

gene ontology categories overrepresented in differentially expressed puts
an overrepresentation analysis was performed to identify gene ontology  categories in the differentially expressed puts that showed a response to environmental conditions or showed differences between the provenances. using fisher’s exact test  we identified  <dig> go categories that were overrepresented in higher expressed puts when taw was low, in contrast to  <dig> go categories that were overrepresented when taw was high. for temperature we identified  <dig> go categories that were overrepresented in higher expressed puts when temperature was high and  <dig> go categories that were overrepresented when temperature was low. for daylength we identified  <dig> go categories that were overrepresented in higher expressed puts when daylength was longer, compared to  <dig> go categories that were overrepresented when daylength was shorter. a comparison of go ontologies between the two provenances revealed  <dig> go categories that were overrepresented in puts that were stronger expressed in provenance cameron lake compared to one single go category that was overrepresented in puts that were stronger expressed in provenance salmon arm .

for each regressor and direction of expression we chose the  <dig> most overrepresented go categories and investigated the biological functions of puts within each go category . we investigated the best hit in the arabidopsis thaliana peptide data base  and in the ncbi refseq data base of puts that we observed within the overrepresented go categories. the best hits in the tair <dig> data base as well as in the ncbi refseq data base are listed in additional file 3: table s <dig>  hits were ranked according to their absolute log <dig> transformed p-value from the test of differential expression. all functional descriptions in the next sections that are not followed by a citation were retrieved from the tair data base.fig.  <dig> go term overrepresentation analysis of puts that respond to environment or are differentially expressed between provenances. the top  <dig> go categories that were significantly overrepresented within puts that respond to temperature, taw, daylength or provenance are shown. redundant go categories have been removed using revigo  <cit>  with default parameters. numbers in columns indicate the amount of overrepresentation which is the number of significant puts within a go category divided by the number of expected puts within a go category and are only shown for significant overrepresentation of a go category . the p-value of fisher’s exact test is indicated by color intensity. red color indicates high overrepresentation of a go category within puts that are positively correlated with temperature and daylength, negatively correlated with taw or stronger expressed in cameron lake . blue color indicates high overrepresentation of go categories within puts that are negatively correlated with temperature and daylength, positively correlated with taw or stronger expressed in salmon arm . the dendrogram indicates the similarity of go categories in terms of shared puts among go categories, expressed by cohen’s kappa. numbers behind go categories indicate the hierarchy of the go graph, while more basal terms have smaller numbers



biological functions of differentially expressed puts that respond to taw
go categories related to starch metabolism, e.g. “starch biosynthetic process”, “starch metabolic process”, and nucleic acid metabolism, e.g. “rna metabolic process”, “nucleic acid metabolic process”, “gene expression”, “regulation of cellular macromolecule compound metabolic process” and “nucleobase-containing compound metabolic process”  were highly overrepresented in puts that were higher expressed when taw was low . puts within the go categories related to nucleic acid metabolism included homologs of the protein kinase wee <dig>  which negatively regulates the entry into mitosis  <cit> , the cdc <dig> related kinase afc <dig> , the wuschel-related homeobox gene family member wox <dig> , the apurinic endonuclease-redox protein arp  which is involved in dna repair, the splicing factor rsz <dig> , the nac domain transcription factor anac <dig>  whose mrna levels increase in response to abscisic acid in arabidopsis thaliana or the zinc-finger proteins ccch <dig> and ccch <dig>  that are involved in rna binding in the response to osmotic stress  <cit> .

within the go categories related to starch metabolism we identified homologs of the phosphoglucomutase pgmp , which controls photosynthetic carbon flow, the beta amylase bam <dig> , the starch branching enzyme sbe <dig>  , or the fructose 1– <dig> bisphosphatase fbp .

go categories related to intracellular transport, e.g. “golgi vesicle transport”, “vesicle mediated transport or “intracellular transport” , were highly overrepresented in puts that were higher expressed when taw was high . within these categories we detected homologs of the vacuolar sorting receptor vsr <dig> , the mate efflux protein , the membrane trafficking proteins syta and sytb , the udp glucose / udp galactose transporter utr <dig> , or the sucrose transporter suc <dig> .

biological functions of differentially expressed puts that respond to temperature
go categories related to oxidative and heat stress, e.g. “response to heat”, “response to hydrogen peroxide”  were highly overrepresented  in puts that were stronger expressed when temperature was high. puts within these categories were homologs to heat shock proteins . other proteins identified are involved in the acclimation to heat, e.g fkbp <dig> which is engaged in thermotolerance   <cit>  or the multiprotein bridging factor mbf1c  which interacts as a co-factor with bzip transcription factors  <cit> .

go categories related to control of gene expression, e.g. “regulation of cellular macromolecule biosynthetic process”, “negative regulation of gene expression”  were also overrepresented. these categories comprised homologs of ethylene responsive transcription factors with erf/ap <dig> domain  which are involved in various stress responses in plants  <cit> . we also identified homologs of hsf2a  which is an important heat shock transcription factor  <cit> . in addition to genes directly involved in control of gene expression, we also observed homologs of genes which are involved in chromatin modification  <cit> , such as the histone methyltransferase suvh <dig>  and otld <dig>   <cit> .

go categories “photosynthesis, light reaction”, “photosynthesis” and “generation of precursor metabolites and energy”  were highly overrepresented  in puts showing a negative response to high temperature. within these categories, we observed homologs of the triose phosphate/3-phosphoglycerate translocator ape <dig> , the large subunit of adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase adg <dig>  which catalyzes the first rate limiting step in starch biosynthesis, the cytosolic malate dehydrogenase c-nad-mdh <dig>  or the chloroplast protein phosphatase tap38/pph <dig>  which dephosphorylates the light harvesting complex of photosystem ii  <cit> .

biological functions of differentially expressed puts in response to daylength
go categories related to signalling and regulation, e.g. “regulation of cellular process”, “response to blue light”, “regulation of response to stimulus”, “signal transduction”, “response to hormone”  were highly overrepresented  in puts that were higher expressed under long day conditions. puts within these categories were homologous to the floral homeotic protein apetala <dig> , the homeobox leucine zipper proteins hb <dig> , hb <dig>  and hb <dig> , the flavonoid  <dig> hydroxylase  <dig> cyp75b <dig> , the lipoxygenase lox <dig> , the myb family transcription factor myb <dig>  or the inositol triphosphate  <dig> phosphatase  <dig> 5ptase <dig>  which regulates growth in seedlings  <cit> .

within the above mentioned go categories we also observed homologs of members of the flowering control network which is tightly coupled to sensing changes in the duration of photoperiod  <cit> . examples are gigantea , flowering locus t , phytochrome b  or leafy .

go categories “ribosome biogenesis” and “translation”  were highly overrepresented  in puts that were higher expressed when daylength decreased. however the puts that were most strongly differentially expressed in these conditions were found within the weakly overrepresented go categories related to gene expression, e.g. “nucleic acid metabolic process” or “gene expression”, and pyruvate metabolism, e.g. “pyruvate metabolic process” . puts within these go categories were homologous to the small hydrophobic protein rci2a , the histidine kinase phytochrome phye , the gata transcription factor gata <dig> , a member of the dreb subfamily a <dig> , the enolase eno <dig> , the thylakoid protein psb <dig>   <cit>  or the phosphatidylglycerol phosphate synthase pgp <dig>  which is involved in cold acclimation  <cit> . in addition we observed many nac domain containing transcription factors .

puts with homology to rci2a were also found in go category “osmotic stress” which was overrepresented as well . within this category we identified homologs of the cold regulated proteins cor <dig> and cor <dig> , the alcohol dehydrogenases adh and adh <dig> , rci2b  or the nadph dependent aldo-keto reductase akr4c <dig> .

biological functions of puts differentially expressed between provenances
go categories related to pigment biosynthesis or photosynthesis, e.g. “cofactor metabolic process”, “isoprenoid metabolic process”, “photosynthesis” or “plastid organization”  were highly overrepresented  in puts that were higher expressed in cameron lake than in salmon arms.

upregulated puts observed within the go categories related to photosynthesis included homologs of the blue light receptor npl <dig>  which mediates stomatal opening and chloroplast movement  <cit> , the protease deg <dig>  which is targeted to the chloroplast to repair damages of the photo system  <cit> , the chlorophyll a oxigenase cao  which enhances photosystem efficiency by increasing the antenna size of photosystems  <cit> , or the small subunit of rubisco . puts within go categories related to pigment biosynthesis were homologous to the phytoene synthase psy , the nadph thioredoxin reductase ntrc , the ferrochelatase  <dig> fc-ii , or the zeaxanthin epoxidase aba <dig>  which converts the photoprotective xanthophyll zeaxanthin into antheraxanthin and violaxanthin  <cit> .

only the go category “phenylpropanoid metabolism” was overrepresented in puts that were higher expressed in salmon arm . within this go category we identified puts that were homologous to the most basal enzymes of the phenylpropanoid pathway, e.g. the 4-coumarate ligase 4cl , the cinnamate- <dig> hydroxylase c4h , the o-methyltransferase omt <dig>  or the chalcone synthase tt <dig> .

discussion
a large part of the douglas-fir transcriptome responds to variations in environmental conditions in the field
we have investigated transcript expression in needles of adult douglas-fir trees growing under natural field conditions. we assessed differences in transcriptome dynamics in response to variations in environmental conditions but also variations in transcript abundance among individual trees and among two differentially adapted provenances. the alignment of our rna-seq data to our non-redundant douglas-fir put set using the unigene catalogues of  <cit>  allowed identification of  <dig> expressed puts. these 60 k puts correspond to  <dig> unique hits in the picea glauca gene catalogue  <cit> . we assume that these unique hits correspond to an equivalent number of unique gene loci which is in concordance with the number of expressed genes in pinaceae needle tissue  <cit> . despite stringent cut-off values , many picea homologs were differentially expressed in response to variations in environmental conditions: 15 % for taw, 10 % for temperature, 16 % for daylength and 82 % for date. a recent gene expression study conducted in pinaceae detected  <dig> of  <dig>  ortholog sequences among picea and pinus to be differentially expressed in response to environmental conditions in a growth chamber  <cit> , this being in the range of our estimates. the most comprehensive transcriptome analysis performed in oryza sativa under field conditions estimated that 43 % of all expressed genes respond to temperature, radiation and other macroenvironmental factors  <cit> . richards et al.  <cit>  detected variation in expression over time in almost all genes in two arabidopsis accessions that were grown in a natural environment. this indicates that a large part of expressed genes in leaf tissue responds to variations in natural environmental conditions.

puts that are differentially expressed in response to temperature and daylength reveal homology to genes controlled by heat stress and photoperiod
high temperature at the field sites clearly shaped gene expression in douglas-fir needles. we observed stronger expression of puts that are related to heat shock proteins and other heat stress related proteins like mbf <dig> when temperature was high, e.g. the ascorbate peroxidase apx <dig> or hsfa <dig>  <cit> . in addition we observed stronger expression of puts related to erf/ap <dig> family transcription factors that are also well known to be stronger expressed in response to stress  <cit> . in contrast, puts related to photosynthetic activity, sugar and energy metabolism were weaker expressed when temperature was high. notable examples are puts related to the triosephosphate/3-phosphoglycerate translocator ape <dig> which is a key component in transporting assimilated carbon from the chloroplast into the cytosol, or the adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase adg <dig> which is important in starch biosynthesis. reduced expression of genes involved in photosynthesis in response to temperature stress has already been described by  <cit>  in arabidopsis and by  <cit>  in arabidopsis, populus and glycine. taken together, the observed gene expression pattern suggests a highly conserved response to temperature in several herbaceous plants and trees such as poplar, and based on our data also in douglas-fir.

day length controlled more than 16 % of the transcriptome. major go categories that were overrepresented in puts that were more abundant when day length was long were “meristeme development” or “response to hormone stimulus” . upon deeper analysis, we observed many members of the gene network that controls flowering in angiosperms  <cit> .

exposure to short day length resulted in a complex response of the transcriptome. puts that were higher expressed when daylength was low displayed homology to proteins involved in cold acclimation like rci <dig> -a and -b  <cit> , adh  <cit>  or the nadph dependent aldo-keto reductase akr4c <dig>  <cit> . preparation for cold acclimation is associated with osmotic stress  <cit> . thus, it is not unexpected that we observed puts with homology to dreb <dig>  <cit>  or nac domain containing transcription factors that are known to be induced by dehydration stress  <cit> .

the most comprehensive study of cold acclimation in a natural environment has been conducted in picea sitchensis seedlings where the authors contrasted gene expression during october, november and december with late summer gene expression during august  <cit> . several transcripts with homology to proteins that are known to be involved in the adaptation to cold were identified in this study. although their sampling time-points did only partially overlap with ours, over 40 % of the best hits in the arabidopsis thaliana peptide data base observed in  <cit>  were also observed in the differentially expressed puts in response to daylength. this consistent pattern is remarkable as we used a different measurement method, used strict filter criteria to classify puts as significant, and used adult individuals of a different conifer species. examples for overlapping annotations are gi or rci2-a. interestingly, neither  <cit>  nor our study detected stronger expression of cbf/dreb transcription factors which are known to be essential for acclimation to low temperatures in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit>  when day length decreases.

reduced taw induced expression of transcripts related to starch metabolism, a conserved response to reduced water availability in plants
in response to low taw, go categories related to nucleic acid and starch metabolism were overrepresented, while go categories related to intracellular transport were overrepresented when taw was high . although no go categories related to osmotic stress were significantly overrepresented we observed upregulation of individual puts that are involved in osmoregulation. we observed homologs of the osmosensor hk <dig>  which is higher abundant in arabidopsis when osmolarity is especially high or low  <cit> , or to aquaporins which are involved in handling osmotic stress  <cit> . in particular the aquaporins tip <dig> , pip <dig>  , and pip <dig>   were identified. compared to the response to reduced day length, fewer specific indicators for osmotic stress were identified. however, we identified several homologs representing general stress responses when taw was low. we observed puts with homology to the ap2/erf domain containing transcription factors erf- <dig> , dear <dig>  and ebp . ap2/erf domain containing transcription factors are involved in general stress responses but are also involved in osmotic stress  <cit> . in addition we observed homologs of the copper/zinc superoxide dismutase csd <dig>  which is known to be expressed in drought stressed plants  <cit> , the nadph dependent thioredoxin reductase ntrc  and the protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase pora  which protect the chloroplast against oxidative damage  <cit> . these annotations are indicators for a certain amount of stress that the trees were confronted with during june and july at the site wiesloch when taw was low.

transcription factors that are typically not known to be involved in the response to reduced water availability were also identified in the puts that were stronger abundant when water availability was low. examples are the helix-loop-helix protein cib , the transcriptional repressor myb <dig>  which is involved in the response to uv-b  <cit>  or sig <dig>  which is expressed in response to high light  <cit> .

in contrast to the responses to heat and changes in photoperiod, gene expression responses to decreases in water availability are less uniform among different experiments conducted in the same species and organ  <cit> . this is because the experimental manipulation of water stress is far more difficult to control than the manipulation of photoperiod and temperature. nevertheless, an increase in starch metabolism under conditions of water shortage was also observed under conditions of mild drought stress in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . a recent meta-analysis also revealed that enhanced expression in response to drought is conserved among species including oryza sativa, arabidopsis thaliana, triticum aestivum or glycine max  <cit> . pinheiro and chaves  <cit>  and prasch and sonnewald  <cit>  did also report downregulation of genes related to intracellular transport in arabidopsis thaliana which is consistent with our data. we also observed overrepresentation of the go category “cell growth” in puts that were higher expressed when taw was high . thus, our results indicate reduced cell growth and proliferation when water availability is low. this has also been reported for arabidopsis thaliana by  <cit>  and  <cit> . indicators for the reduced growth are homologs of wee <dig> which negatively regulates the entry into mitosis  <cit>  that were higher expressed when taw was low.

in contrast to the response to high temperature, no go categories related to photosynthesis were overrepresented in puts that were weaker expressed when taw was low. this indicates no effect of low water availability on photosynthetic related gene expression. this phenomenon has also been reported by  <cit>  in arabidopsis thaliana.

the two provenances cameron lake and salmon arm differ in constitutive expression of transcripts related to photosynthesis
the effect of environment on the global transcript expression was high, nonetheless expression differences between the provenances were rather small, since only  <dig> puts were differentially expressed between the provenances. the weak expression differences between the provenances were not only indicated by the low number of differentially expressed puts, but also by the generally small variation in put expression levels among provenances  and a high variation in expression among trees . these findings are consistent with reports by  <cit>  who detected only about  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts between provenances from contrasting habitats in picea sitchensis, or by  <cit>  who reported weak genetic variation in the metabolite abundance among multiple douglas-fir families.

despite their small number, the transcripts that are differentially expressed between the two provenances are likely responsible for differences in adaptive traits. for example, puts that were observed in higher abundance in cameron lake were related to photosynthesis. examples are homologs of the serine/threonine kinase npl <dig> , which can act as a blue light photoreceptor and is involved in controlling of stomatal opening  <cit> . overexpression of npl <dig> resulted in enhanced photosynthetic activity and growth in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . other examples are the protease deg <dig>  which is targeted to the chloroplast to repair damages of the photosystems  <cit>  or the chlorophyll a oxygenase cao which enhances the efficiency of the photosystems by increasing the antenna size of photosystems  <cit> . the higher expression of these genes might translate into a generally higher photosynthetic activity in cameron lake.

moreover, it has been frequently reported from common garden experiments that water use efficiency  is higher in coastal than in interior dougals fir  <cit>  and  <cit> . this is a counterintuitive observation, since one would expect that interior douglas fir provenances from higher altitudes would generally be better adapted to episodic water limitations, which is often associated with increased wue. aitken et al.  <cit>  and zhang et al.  <cit>  suggested that the location of the experimental sites must have an influence on wue. however, the observation that npl1/phot <dig>  which controls stomatal opening and hence wue, is higher expressed in the coastal provenance cameron lake indicates that higher wue in a coastal douglas fir provenance might result from an increased ability for regulating stomatal behavior and mediating higher wue.

interactions of provenance and environment
the effect of the interaction among provenance and date which represents the genotype by environment interaction , was surprisingly low with only  <dig> puts showing a response . only three of these puts were homologous to arabidopsis thaliana genes: a calmodulin binding protein , an armadillo repeat protein  and a subunit of the cytochrome oxidase cox <dig> . due to the small extent of the gxe effect we did not further investigate interactions among provenances and the individual environmental regressors  because we expected those interactions to be even weaker. weak gxe effects on the transcriptome dynamics were also observed in field-grown seedlings of arabidopsis thaliana from contrasting habitats  <cit> . in addition, there is also evidence that transcript levels of only a small number of genes are influenced by eqtl x environment interactions in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> .

puts that responded to environment  showed a lower variation of put abundance among provenances  and trees  compared to all detected puts. thus, the small gxe effect in our data from field-grown adult douglas-fir trees suggests that plastic transcriptome responses to variations in environmental conditions are strongly conserved both at the tree and provenance level. these findings are supported by results from  <cit>  who observed that 74 % of the genes that respond to variations in environmental conditions in a growth chamber experiment also displayed conserved expression patterns in picea and pinus despite the large divergence time of both species . most notably, in our experiments the expression of puts that responded to temperature varied less among provenances and trees compared to all other environmental factors . previous experiments performed in growth chambers comparing glycine max, arabidopsis thaliana and seedlings of populus trichocarpa revealed that transcriptome dynamics in response to high temperature are conserved across these angiosperm species  <cit> . nevertheless, the observation that there is such a small variation in the response to high temperature among mature field grown trees and provenances of a conifer species is striking and highly relevant for foresters for adapting forests to climate change. overall, the small gxe effects indicate that local adaptation has a rather small effect on the ability of douglas-fir trees to modulate gene expression and their ability to deal with novel climates. it seems that differences in gene expression between the provenances , indicated by  <dig> differentially expressed puts and overrepresentation of go categories including photosynthesis and secondary metabolism, by far outweigh the importance of gxe effects in the two provenances included in our study. nevertheless we only investigated a rather small number of genotypes, and only over one growing season. thus, it would be important to assess if the genes that contributed here to the plastic response to environment between the two provenances will be also involved among larger groups of populations and larger temporal scales.

CONCLUSIONS
whole transcriptome responses to natural and highly variable environmental conditions were studied in adult douglas-fir trees representing two populations from contrasting habitats. we investigated the correlation of transcript abundance with regressors that represented high temperature, photoperiod and water availability. functional annotation and overrepresentation analysis revealed that douglas-fir transcript regulation was similar to other species, indicating the high conservation of transcript expression in response to environmental cues. thus our data set represents a rich repository of validated transcriptional responses to the main abiotic parameters of a natural and highly variable environment.

almost no transcripts with divergent plastic expression responses between the provenances were observed. in addition, the transcripts that responded to environmental cues varied less among trees and among provenances compared with expression variations in the transcriptome. in contrast, we observed a substantial constitutive differentiation in gene expression activity related to photosynthesis and secondary metabolism between both provenances. therefore we assume that local adaptation in pseudotsuga menziesii is unlikely to be driven by divergent transcriptional short-term responses to environment among populations, suggesting that local adaptation is not reflected in short-term responses and instead determines long term physiological and metabolic processes.
