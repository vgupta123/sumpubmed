BACKGROUND
huntington’s disease is an inherited autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor dysfunction, psychiatric disturbances, and progressive dementia  <cit> . hd is caused by an unstable cag repeat expansion in the gene encoding huntingtin  on chromosome  <dig>  leading to an extended polyglutamine  stretch in the amino terminus of the htt protein  <cit> ; the disease is therefore associated with a mutant form of the htt protein that contains  <dig> or more glutamine residues. the presence of pathologic expanded hd alleles is detected by diagnostic testing in compliance with the standards and guideline for clinical genetics laboratories; other scalable-throughput screening assay by pcr-mca  <cit>  or chimeric primed pcr   <cit>  are developed and represent an attractive alternative to classical molecular screening method.

pathogenesis arises mainly from mhtt expression, which leads to the formation of toxic soluble protein oligomers and insoluble aggregates  <cit> , contributing to the disruption of multiple intracellular pathways involving mitochondrial dysfunction  <cit> , oxidative stress  <cit> , transcriptional dysregulation  <cit> , autophagy  <cit>  and metabolic impairment  <cit> . nevertheless, loss of wild-type htt function may also have a role in hd  <cit> .

several efforts are made to correlate the dysregulation of these pathways  <cit>  with hd, providing solid platforms to describe disease progression. the pathology onset and severity significantly correlate with polyq length  <cit> , although environmental modulators and associated gene-environment interactions also influence disease progression  <cit> . moreover hd is characterized by general brain atrophy and neuronal cell loss  <cit> , which starts from the striatum and cortex, extending to other subcortical brain regions  <cit> . whilst mhtt expression in the cns  <cit>  is the primary pathological hallmark in hd development  <cit> , the presence of abnormalities in several other compartments  <cit>  provide a source of accessible tissue for htt quantification potentially to monitor disease progression and treatment efficacy. here, we report the development of a robust and simple elisa assay that is sensitive enough to detect differences in endogenous htt levels in blood from hd patients at different stages of disease, highlighting its potential suitability for monitoring both disease progression and therapeutic intervention in clinical trials.

RESULTS
protein purification and quality control 
recombinant human htt full-length protein carrying a 3xflag tag at the n-terminus and a polyq stretch of  <dig> glutamine residues  was produced using an inducible cell clone 293/t-rex® q138-cre-rl <dig>  expressing intracellular htt protein upon doxycycline induction  <cit> . to maximize yield and avoid significant degradation of the protein, induction times ranging from  <dig> to 96 hours were tested on small scale samples. we chose an induction time of 24 hours for the htt-q <dig> large scale preparation, since at that time htt expression was stable. figure 1a shows a typical result of the protein purification process. purified htt-q <dig> showed an apparent molecular weight of ~ <dig> kda in agreement with the calculated value of 348 kda. recombinant protein was recognized by anti-flag antibody in cell lysate and efficiently captured by the same antibody immobilized onto the resin. subsequently, it was eluted from the resin, by the competing flag-peptide; typically, we were able to obtain ~ <dig> μg of htt-q <dig> from  <dig> × <dig> cells with a purity of more than 90%, as evaluated by coomassie stained nupage gels. the identity of the purified protein was confirmed by western blotting using anti-htt specific antibodies . tandem mass spectrometry analysis of purified protein samples, digested with three different enzymes , identified  <dig> unique peptides of the protein, which corresponded to a sequence coverage of 86% and confirmed the purity of htt-q <dig> 

selection of antibodies for the htt-elisa
several commercially-available antibodies , raised against epitopes that were not overlapping with the polyq region, were selected on the basis of their declared properties and literature description, with the aim of developing an elisa sandwich assay able to quantify htt protein in biological matrices  irrespective of its polyq expansion. the performance of each antibody as a capturer was assessed using purified htt-q <dig> as the standard protein and anti-flag-hrp conjugate as the detection antibody. signal to background reading ratios were evaluated comparing four dilutions of each capture antibody against the standard curve, composed of concentrations ranging up to 5000 pg/well. the 4e <dig> and 3e <dig> antibodies were the most efficient, detecting htt quantities up to 50 ng/well, reaching 18-fold signal-to-background ratio at saturation. the same procedure was then applied to select the best detection antibody. the most suitable was ep867y and this was chosen together with 4e <dig> as the capture antibody to form the final htt-elisa. subsequently, the assay conditions were optimized in terms of the concentrations of primary, secondary and hrp-conjugated antibody, incubation times and blocking agent to determine the maximally sensitive and stable assay conditions. these were 4e <dig> at 1 μg/ml, ep867y at 1 μg/ml and blocking with bsa 1%. under these conditions, the assay showed a dynamic range of five orders of magnitude , with a 19-fold signal-to-background ratio. ten serial dilutions of htt-q138were used to generate standard curves in all subsequent analyses. assay validation has been performed using ten independent experiments, obtaining intra-plate %cv below 10%, inter-assay %cv lower than 20%, lloq  of  <dig>  fmol/well and accuracy within a 10% error. in each case, the standard curve was fitted with four-parameter sigmoid model and threshold for r square above  <dig>  was set as acceptance criterion. an example of standard curve is presented in figure 1c.

mutant and wild type htt quantification in mammalian cell extracts
total lysates of induced and non-induced rl <dig> cells, were used to establish the sensitivity and specificity of the htt-elisa on complex matrices. since we were interested in quantifying only the soluble protein, a centrifugation step in lysates preparation was introduced to avoid any interference from htt aggregates. this was adopted for all subsequent analyses. htt-q <dig> expression induced by 24 hours treatment with 1 μg/ml doxycycline was detected by our assay, showing an approximately 500-fold increase in htt protein expression by these cells . we also assessed the sensitivity of the assay for wild-type htt relative to the mutant form, even though both molecular species should be detected with the same sensitivity . we therefore verified the antibodies performance for the two proteins using total lysates of hek  <dig> cells transiently transfected with plasmids encoding for 3xflag-full length htt with either a stretch of  <dig> or  <dig> glutamine residues. 24 hours after transfection, cell lysates were analyzed by western blotting with anti-htt h <dig> and by our htt-elisa assay . the quantification of soluble htt levels was in agreement with the densitometric quantification of western blot analysis of the same samples , demonstrating that the elisa method was able to detect wild-type and mutant protein with the same sensitivity.

pharmacological assay validation
as inhibitors of hsp <dig> have been demonstrated to modulate mhtt steady state levels in cellular systems  <cit> , we decided to validate our assay by assessing the detection of soluble htt in complex matrices following pharmacological modulation. firstly we verified that co-expression of hsp <dig> with wild-type and mutant htt significantly increased the levels of htt detected by the assay in total cell lysates . this effect is exerted at protein level, as no increase in either htt-q <dig> or htt-q <dig> mrna was observed by real-time qpcr and paradoxically, htt-q <dig> mrna was reduced . for pharmacological modulation, cells were treated for 24 hours with nvp-auy <dig>  a small molecule known to be a potent hsp <dig> inhibitor  <cit> . upon modulation of hsp <dig> activity, we observed a significant reduction in soluble htt protein irrespective of the presence of the expanded polyq stretch . interestingly this treatment not only reduced the soluble protein, but also induced the expression of its mrna as shown by rt-pcr analysis . in summary, the pharmacological validation of the assay demonstrated its capacity to detect, in a significant manner, small variations in soluble htt levels induced by inhibition of an enzyme modulating protein degradation.

htt detection in blood cells
a bioassay designed to measure soluble htt level multiple times over long periods of time in clinical trials requires a minimally invasive procedure to obtain suitable material for analysis. therefore, we chose pbmcs, as they are easily obtained from a patient’s blood sample. preliminary experiments using lysates of fresh pbmcs obtained from 6 ml of pooled rat blood allowed us to measure htt at a concentration of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm . this demonstrated that the sensitivity of the assay was sufficient to quantify native protein using 100 μl/well of total lysate without using any sample enrichment procedure. to verify the suitability of the assay for the quantification of the htt protein in specimens similar to those commonly available in clinical trials, we analyzed lysates from frozen human pbmc pellets. the complete set of samples, five subjects of each group, included healthy volunteers, premanifest and hd patients at early, moderate and advanced disease-stage. to ensure assay reproducibility, in vitro aggregation of high molecular weight htt protein was prevented by processing each pbmc sample as described in the methods section. soluble htt levels and total protein content were subsequently measured and results were expressed for each sample as ratio between htt quantities and total protein content . htt quantification was repeated in independent experiments, loading all the samples to be compared on the same plate to avoid inter-plate effects. the outcome of these series of experiments clearly demonstrated that hd patients have significantly lower levels of soluble htt in their pbmcs compared with healthy controls. this negative modulation is even more evident when symptoms of the disease become manifest, suggesting altered htt processing and clearance  <cit>  as the disease progresses.

discussion
the site of the disease-causing mutation in the htt gene responsible for hd was identified twenty years ago  <cit> . since then, efforts have focused on the study of htt and its role in pathogenesis, identifying the etiology of the disorder, treating and preventing motor symptoms, and managing a range of neurologic and behavioral complications  <cit> . the investigation has been challenging due to the high molecular weight of the htt protein, its heterologous expression, and the tendency to aggregate  <cit> . consequently, research has been directed at truncated forms  <cit>  instead of the full-length protein. however, recent studies have started to examine the presence of the native full-length protein in human brain  <cit> , leading to the generation of more physiological models of hd pathology  <cit>  and suggesting that full length htt may also be pathogenic in hd  <cit> , thus boosting pharmaceutical research into drugs augmenting htt clearance. the development of the assay is driven by the necessity to quantify in a precise and sensitive way the full length htt protein in multiple biological matrices. during the development of the assay, we were able to identify suitable sandwich detection reagents from a wide selection of commercially available monoclonal antibodies against different epitopes of the full-length htt protein. importantly, the selected antibodies recognized not only the human htt, but also the rodent homologue, facilitating quantification of the endogenous protein in animal models. our elisa has been demonstrated to be capable of detecting both the wild-type and mutant htt protein with comparable sensitivity and to be very robust as the assay has been repeated over a period of more than two years, by different operators using several antibody lots giving always comparable results. the assay produced results in keeping with published data detecting a pharmacological modulation of hsp <dig> activity by means of its effect on soluble htt levels in cultured cells. the analysis of human samples indicates that levels of soluble htt in pbmc cells was quantifiable using our assay without any need of enrichment and that it was possible to detect different levels of the protein in healthy controls compared to hd patients. in fact, the decline in soluble htt levels has already been shown to inversely correlate with disease-related aggregated htt  <cit> . interestingly, soluble htt levels in premanifest mutation carriers are closer to those in hd patients with manifest disease than in healthy volunteers. we therefore speculate that the assay could be used as a valuable tool to monitor htt concentrations longitudinally and to assess the efficacy of htt lowering compounds in clinical trials and also in preclinical phase of the disease. despite the interest of htt quantification in peripheral tissues, only one assay, a tr-fret for the detection of total and mutant htt, has been published  <cit> . this homogeneous assay employs non-commercial antibodies and does not reveal differences in total htt protein when comparing hd patients with healthy controls. the discrepancy of the results of the two assays could be explained in terms of different techniques, antibodies and analytes solubilization procedures used.

CONCLUSIONS
the results presented here demonstrate that this htt-elisa is able to reliably detect the variation of htt levels following pharmacological manipulation of an enzyme known to act on the steady-state levels of the protein. further, it can differentiate between peripheral cells isolated from healthy controls and hd patients at different disease stages. this assay has recently been applied in a phase 1b clinical study performed at different sites, and represents a quick, easy and reliable tool to monitor the effects of potential therapeutics for hd in observational and clinical trials.
