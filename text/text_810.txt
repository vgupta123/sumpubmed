BACKGROUND
sesamum indicum  is an ancient crop with a mid-range genome size of ~357 mb, and contains high concentrations of oils and proteins with medicinal value. however, this species is prone to waterlogging, and is particularly susceptible to many fungal and bacterial diseases, such as stem and root rot, fusarium wilt, powdery mildew and others. these biotic and abiotic stresses can lead to lower overall yields, with outputs strongly associated with growth conditions. to overcome environmental stresses and improve yields, abundant germplasm along with genetic information are required for plant-breeding programs  <cit> , and characterization of genome-wide patterns of allele variation and linkage disequilibrium ensure the detection of reliable phenotype–genotype associations and signatures of molecular selection  <cit> . india, china and korea are the leading countries for sesame germplasm collection, preservation and research  <cit> . in china, ~ <dig>  strains of sesame have been deposited in the national gene bank of china . in korea, >  <dig>  variants have been preserved in the gene bank of the rural development administration  located in suwon, korea  <cit> , and in india >  <dig>  variants have been archived in the national bureau of plant genetic resources . however, few studies have examined the genetic diversity of the sesame germplasm on a genome-wide scale due to a lack of genomic information and an absence of suitable biomarkers  <cit> .

sesame is the most common cultivar of the genus sesamum, which contains more than  <dig> species of flowering plants. unlike sesame, the majority of species in this genus have not been domesticated, with significant divergence in polyploidy levels  <cit> . as most of these wild species are native to sub-saharan africa, sesame was originally believed to have originated in africa; however, domesticated sesame has since been shown to have originated on the indian subcontinent  <cit> . further investigation into the evolution of sesame has been hampered by the absence of detailed molecular data across multiple sesame strains.

completion of the sesame reference genome provides an essential resource for exploring the genetic variation of wild and domesticated s. indicum . here, we analyzed  <dig> resequenced sesame strains collected from  <dig> countries at a coverage of ≥ 13-fold. from these data, we have constructed the first haplotype map for sesame, which provides insight into the genetic diversity of sesame across multiple strains. these data can be used for the development of genome-wide association studies, and in turn facilitate the mapping of genes associated with both simple and complex traits.

RESULTS
phenotype diversity of resequenced sesame strains
we manually selected  <dig> sesame strains for genome resequencing, including  <dig> from its presumed origin sites of india and africa,  <dig> from china,  <dig> from the united states and  <dig> each from afghanistan, the united arab emirates, korea, myanmar, the philippines and viet nam . these strains exhibited a wide range of phenotypes, including determinate and indeterminate growth habits, tall and short plant height, early and late flowering, different seed coat color, single and triple flowers per leaf axil, uniculm and branching style, and others. the distant geographic relationships and wide phenotype variation made these strains an ideal model for exploration of the genetic diversity of cultivated sesame .figure  <dig>

landscape of the genetic diversity of sesame
to identify large-scale polymorphisms and better understand the genetic structure of the sesame germplasm, each of the  <dig> sesame strains were re-sequenced, generating more than  <dig> gb of filtered data at a coverage depth of ≥ 13× for each strain . all sequence reads were aligned against the reference genome of “zhongzi no. 13”, which has an effective genome length of 274 mb , using the bwa software  <cit> . the mapping rate across different strains varied from  <dig> % to  <dig> %, for an average of  <dig> %. the mapping result is consistent with that from the gatk software .

using a stringent pipeline, we identified an average of  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphisms  per strain using the samtools software  <cit> , ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . overall, snp rates ranged from  <dig>  × 10- <dig> to  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  respectively, with g:a, a:g, c:t and t:c substitutions being the most common . by combining snp across all strains, we identified  <dig> , <dig> unique snps, for a population snp rate of  <dig>  × 10-3 bp- <dig>  we next employed gatk software to call and calculate the snp population, which resulted in generation of a total of  <dig> , <dig> population snps. the concordance rates between gatk and samtools ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> % with an average of  <dig> % for the  <dig> linkage groups  . sanger sequencing showed that the snp calling accuracy rate was ~ <dig> % . these results indicated that the majority of snps detected here were reliable. of these snps,  <dig> % were located within gene coding regions with  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % in the 5′ untranslated region , coding sequence  and 3′utr, respectively . the top three snp rates were detected in strains  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  which originated in india, myanmar and the united arab emirates, respectively; thus these regions may harbor a more diverse sesame germplasm.table  <dig>

although sesame is traditionally considered a self-pollinating plant, it is also subjected to crossed pollination by insects such as butterflies and bees. this is consistent with the observed rate of heterozygosity ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> %, with an average of  <dig> % . five of the  <dig> chinese cultivars  exhibited lower heterozygous rates  compared to both mean levels and other non-chinese strains. the unusually high heterozygosity rates for strains  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> suggest that these strains are more attractive to insects; however, more trivial explanations, such as sequencing and alignment errors, cannot be ruled out, especially in the repeat regions.

population snps were used to calculate two commonly used population genetics statistics: population diversity  and watterson’s estimator of segregating sites . the average π and θw values across all  <dig> strains were  <dig>  and  <dig>  per kb, respectively, which are lower than that of rice  <cit>  but higher than chickpea   <cit> , watermelon   <cit>  and soybean  <cit>  . we observed numerous consecutive slide windows along with the pseudomolecules  that contained fewer than normal snps, and in turn lower π and θw values , indicative of an uneven distribution of genetic diversity along sesame pseudomolecules. we examined the genome for the highest and lowest polymorphic regions  and found that the number of genes in the highest polymorphic regions was smaller than in the lowest regions  , similar to other species, such as chickpea  <cit> . many of the genes in the highest polymorphic regions were related to environmental adaptability, including stress response pathways . these genes may offer a valuable resource for the study of biotic and abiotic stress in sesame. it is also interesting to note that despite the greater number of genes in the lowest polymorphic regions, only five genes were enriched in two gene ontology  terms, all of which were associated with basic biological functions; i.e., ribosome binding .figure  <dig>

we next used the mapped reads that met all pair-end requirements, but contained alignment gaps in one end of the contig to detect short indels  in each strain. the overall number of indels detected was inversely proportional to the length of the indel . the numbers identified across all  <dig> strains ranged from  <dig>  -  <dig>  , for a total of  <dig>  unique indels . similar to snps, the distribution of indels along the genome was not uniform, with high-density regions strongly associated with regions containing high snp density . among these indels, the numbers of insertions and deletions were similar . homozygous indels were found at a rate more than  <dig> -fold that of heterozygous indels. of these indels,  <dig> % were located in intergenic regions,  <dig> %  in cds and  <dig> % in utrs, respectively.

structural variation  was originally defined as insertions, deletions, dna inversions and other sequence rearrangements greater than 1 kb in size  <cit> . with sequencing now becoming routine  <cit> , the operational spectrum of structural variants has widened to include much smaller events  <cit> . in the present study, we detected svs between 10 bp and 1 mb using the software package breakdancer v <dig>   <cit>  set to default parameters. we found  <dig>  -  <dig>  svs per strain  across all  <dig> strains when compared to the reference genome . for these svs, deletion events outnumbered insertions at a rate of nearly two to one . outside of indels, the rates of other svs, including dna inversion, intrachromosomal translocation and interchromosomal translocation were relatively low, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  . the majority of svs were between  <dig> - 1000 bp in size, with longer variations  less abundant, especially those longer than 10 kb , consistent with that seen in sorghum  <cit> .

the effect of variations on genes
dna sequence changes within genes plays a pivotal role in morphology and plant evolution. of the  <dig>  annotated genes in sesame genome ,  <dig> %  were found to contain one or more snps in comparison to the reference genome. furthermore,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % , and  <dig> %  of genes contained snps in their cds, 5′utrs, and 3′utrs, respectively. these genes were categorized into  <dig> molecular function groups, with 30% associated with the terms protein binding, hydrolase activity and atp binding; however, all genes with predicted hydrolase activity contained snps only within their cds regions . further analysis identified  <dig> genes with snps in their cds regions that were significantly enriched  for the biological processes cell death and apoptotic process . the  <dig>  non-synonymous and  <dig>  synonymous snps identified in coding regions represent a non-synonymous-to-synonymous substitution ratio of  <dig>  , similar to that of sorghum   <cit> , but higher than that of arabidopsis thaliana   <cit>  and lower than that of soybean   <cit>  and rice   <cit> . go term enrichment for genes with non-synonymous snps were strongly associated with cell death, apoptosis, and defense response , particularly those genes encoding disease resistance proteins, udp-glucosyltransferase or the proteins containing leucine-rich repeats and nb-arc domains . these results are indicative of a higher rate of mutation in genes involved in biotic stress responses, consistent with the theory that plant-pathogen interactions result in the diversification of pathogen-associated molecular pattern recognition receptors  <cit> .

coding region snps located in key structural locations can lead to significant changes in protein morphology, and in turn cause changes in overall protein function. within the  <dig> sesame strains examined, we identified  <dig>  snps associated with the formation of premature stop codons and  <dig> stop codon to non-stop codon mutations. start codon to non-start codon mutations were observed in  <dig> genes, along with an additional  <dig> splice site mutations . most of these large-effect snps were located on the proximal ends of the pseudomolecules  . annotation of these four large-effect snps categories revealed different patterns of functional enrichment. for example, start codon to non-start codon mutations were found primarily in genes involved in transport, apoptosis, and defense response, while splice site mutations were more common in genes associated with cellular metabolism, oxidation-reduction, organic substance metabolism, and nitrogen compound metabolism . among the four types of large-effect snps, premature stop codons were particularly interesting, as these mutations are often associated with loss of function. the majority of the mutations were found in genes associated with the go biological processes related to adversity, including cell death, apoptosis, and defense response .

despite the fact that most snps were detected in cds regions, cds regions accounted for only  <dig> % of the  <dig>  indel mutations, lower than both the 5′ and 3′utrs . the number of genes containing indels in the 5′ and 3′ utrs decreased as indel size increased from  <dig> to 5 bp, but the cds indels increased significantly in 3-bp indels, similar to that observed in sorghum  <cit>  . this enrichment of 3-bp indels is to be expected, as indels that are not multiples of 3 bp result in frame shifts and are usually fatal. finally, we analyzed the distribution of indels on the basis of gene ontology, and found they were similar to snps resulting in premature stop codons, with statistically significant enrichment  in genes involved in cell death, apoptosis, and defense response .

genetic relationships among the  <dig> sesame strains tested
when considering whether sesame was first cultivated in africa or on the indian subcontinent  <cit> , it is important to investigate the effects of geography on sesame genetic diversity. a phylogenetic tree containing all  <dig> sesame strains was constructed using the neighbor-joining method. this analysis revealed the highest degrees of relatedness among the chinese strains, with strains originating in other countries spread throughout . this interwoven nature of sesame strains derived from different geographic locations was also evident based on principal component analysis  . indistinct groups were observed using the bayesian clustering software structure  <cit>  with k changing progressively from  <dig> –  <dig> .figure  <dig>

as this study did not include any relatives or wild species of sesame, definitive conclusions regarding the origins of sesame are not possible. however, the phylogenetic relationships observed among the  <dig> sesame strains shed some light on the evolution of sesame. the three strains from india, myanmar, and the united arab emirates exhibited higher genetic distances relative to the other strains . according to the vavilov center of diversity theory, which states that richer genetic diversity is observed in the location where a plant was first domesticated  <cit> , these results suggest that sesame originated on the indian subcontinent.

high linkage disequilibrium in sesame
ld patterns are necessary to determine mapping resolution when designing association studies  <cit>  and interpreting association peaks  <cit> . to estimate the ld of sesame, we calculated r <dig> between pairs of snps using haploview  <cit>  and found that it decayed to ~ <dig>  from an initial value of  <dig>  over the course of ~150 kb . the ld decay estimate of sesame is comparable to that of self-pollinated soybean   <cit> , but higher than that seen in a. thaliana   <cit> , indica rice   <cit>  and foxtail millet . it was also significantly higher than that of cross-pollinated plants such as sorghum   <cit>  and maize   <cit> . the high ld of sesame makes it not only a good plant for studying the effects of extreme ld in genomic and population structures  <cit> , but also suitable for gwas with relatively few polymorphic markers.

bulked segregant analysis for the candidate sites of the number of flowers per leaf axil in sesame
bulked segregant analysis  is a rapid method that allows for the detection of markers in specific genomic regions  <cit>  and has been successfully applied to detect quantitative trait loci  or genes for various traits in rice  <cit> , maize  <cit> , and wheat  <cit> . in combination with high-throughput sequencing technology, bsa has been used to identify a novel xylose utilization gene from saccharomyces cerevisiae. here, we employed the bsa method to explore candidate genes that may be responsible for the number of flowers per leaf axil. this phenotype is an important agronomic trait in sesame as it plays a role in the predicted yield. the  <dig> sesame strains were classified into two groups based on mono-flower versus triple-flower  . we identified  <dig> genes with coincident snps between the two pools. of these genes,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> contained snps in the cds, 5′utr and 3′utr, respectively . go term annotation associated these genes predominantly with atp binding, zinc ion binding, nucleic acid binding and heat shock protein binding. of particular interest were six adenylate isopentenyltransferase  homologs , which were significantly enriched in the zeatin biosynthesis pathway . zeatin is a member of the phytohormone family of cytokinins, which is known to be involved in a variety of processes associated with the growth and development of plants, including promotion of lateral bud growth and stimulation of cell division to produce bushier plants  <cit> . the present results suggest that itp genes may also play a role in the number of flowers per leaf axil of sesame by mediating zeatin biosynthesis. however, further studies using transgenic models or two-parent crossing populations are required.figure  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
next-generation sequencing is rapidly increasing our understanding of genetic variation in crop plants  <cit> . this study provides the first comprehensive resequencing analysis of the high oil crop sesame. the availability of these data, generated from  <dig> strains originating from  <dig> countries, provides insight into genetic variation of the sesame germplasm genome and facilitates a broad range of functional and evolutionary studies including on genome evolution, population genetics, marker-assisted breeding and gene identification. the identification of high ld in the sesame genome indicates that marker-assisted breeding is a better choice for sesame improvement. the data presented here provide new evidence supporting the hypothesis that sesame originated on the indian subcontinent. in both coding and noncoding regions, we identified hundreds of thousands of polymorphisms, which provide an important resource for both evolutionary genetic and functional studies. of particular interest are genes harboring non-synonymous mutations, including large-effect snps, which are likely to mediate interactions with the environment. this study also suggested that the itp genes might play a role in determining the number of flowers per leaf axil of sesame. however, further studies are required to fully understand the functional relevance of the genetic variations identified in this study.
