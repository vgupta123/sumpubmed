BACKGROUND
flowering at an appropriate time is crucial for seed maturity and reproductive success in all flowering plants. multiple flowering promotion pathways that respond to both environmental cues and endogenous factors have been evolved in plants to properly regulate flowering time. in the model plant a. thaliana, the photoperiod and vernalization pathways monitor seasonal changes in day length and temperature. these two pathways are responsible for initiating flowering in response to long days or prolonged cold temperatures . the autonomous pathway, together with the gibberellin acid  pathway, integrates signals from the developmental state of the plant and promotes flowering constitutively  <cit> .

in the photoperiod pathway, constans  is the key protein and its expression is regulated by gi , which is under the control of the circadian clock  <cit> . during long days, co protein accumulates to high enough levels to promote floral transition, and as a result, up-regulates the expression of ft  to initiate flowering  <cit> . both the vernalization pathway and autonomous pathway promote flowering through repression of the expression of flc , a central repressor of flowering in a. thaliana  <cit> . flc is activated by fri , a transcription factor with coiled coil motifs  <cit> . natural a. thaliana winter annuals contain the dominant alleles of fri and require vernalization, which represses flc expression, for flowering  <cit> . vernalization represses the expression of flc by regulating the chromatin status of the flc locus, and the underlying mechanism of this regulation was discussed in several critical reviews  <cit> . in contrast to winter annuals, natural rapid-cycling accessions do not have the functional fri. flc is suppressed constitutively by the so-called autonomous pathway genes, including fca , fy , fpa , fve , ld , fld , and flk   <cit> . among these autonomous pathway components, fca, fpa, fy and flk participate in the rna regulatory process in controlling flowering  <cit> , whereas ld, fve, and fld are involved in the regulation of the chromatin modification state  <cit> .

fld encodes a plant ortholog of the human lys-specific demethylase  <dig>  protein. fld functions in histone h3k <dig> demethylation and h3/h <dig> deacetylation to repress the expression of flc  <cit> . in vivo, fld is a sumoylation target of siz <dig> , an e <dig> ligase in arabidopsis. sumo conjugation to fld inhibits its repression activity for flc expression and is required for full activation of flc in a fri background  <cit> . recently, zhang et al.  <cit>  reported that fld expression is regulated by brz <dig>  in a cyp20- <dig> dependent manner. hence fld may mediate brassinosteroid-controlled flowering regulation in arabidopsis. fld physically interacts with hda <dig> to act synergistically in controlling the flowering of a. thaliana  <cit> . in a. thaliana genome, two other fld homolog, lsd1-like <dig>  and lsd1-like <dig> , act in partial redundancy with fld to repress flc expression. however, ldl <dig> and ldl <dig> act independently of fld in the silencing of fwa , a homeodomain-containing transcription factor. the fwa gene is silenced in the sporophyte and only expressed in the female gamete and extra-embryonic endosperm tissue in a maternal-imprinted manner  <cit> .

soybean is a typical short-day plant and the photoperiod sensitivity of different soybean cultivars is associated with their distribution range. hence, soybean is also a short-day model plant for studying photoperiod response, and much progress has been made in identifying functions of the genes in the photoperiod pathway in soybean. to the best of our knowledge, at least ten ft homologs were experimentally identified in the soybean genome  <cit> . among these ft homologs, gmft2a and gmft5a are thought to be the florigen in soybean, and their expressions are regulated by the phya-mediated photoperiodic regulation system  <cit>  as well as the classical maturity locus e <dig> encoding a novel plant transcription factor, which plays a pivotal role in controlling soybean flowering  <cit> . ectopic expression of gmft2a and gmft5a in a. thaliana resulted in premature flowering  <cit>  and gmft2a over-expression in soybean resulted in precocious flowering independent of photoperiod  <cit> . co has four homologs in soybean, gmcol1a, gmcol1b, gmcol2a and gmcol2b, and each of them can fully complement the late flowering effect of the co mutant in a. thaliana  <cit> . gigantea has three soybean homologs, gmgi1a, gmgi <dig> and gmgi <dig>  whose responses to circadian clock and photoperiod are different from each other  <cit> . gmgi1a is the classical maturity locus e <dig>  who has multiple functions involved in the circadian clock and flowering  <cit> . hence, although soybean is a short-day plant, which is different from a. thaliana, the photoperiod pathway seems to be conserved between these two species  <cit> .

based upon the draft sequence of the soybean genome  <cit> , homologs of autonomous pathway genes were also identified from the genome through bioinformatics analysis  <cit> . however, study on this group of genes has been limited. in this paper, the functions of the soybean fld ortholog, gmfld, were tested experimentally. heterologous expression of gmfld in a. thaliana resulted in early flowering of the transgenic plants and could partially complement the late flowering phenotype of fld mutants. in the gmfld transgenic a. thaliana , flc transcript levels decreased and the floral integrator genes ft and soc <dig> increased significantly. in the complementing transgenic lines, both histone h <dig> lysine <dig> trimethylation  and h <dig> acetylation decreased around the transcriptional start site of flc. our results suggest that gmfld is a functional soybean ortholog of fld and may play an important role in the regulation of the chromatin modification state in soybean.

RESULTS
soybean has four fld homologs
in a. thaliana, fld has other two homologs: ldl <dig> and ldl <dig>  these homologs act redundantly with fld to repress flc transcription  <cit> . by searching the ncbi soybean genome database using the arabidopsis fld protein sequence, four fld homologs  were found: loc <dig> , loc <dig> , loc <dig> , and loc <dig>  with identity of 73%, 57%, 53% and 52% respectively. the deduced amino acid sequences of these four genes were then blasted against the a. thaliana proteome database , and the results show that loc <dig>  has the highest homology to the arabidopsis fld , loc <dig>  and loc <dig>  are more similar to ldl <dig> , and loc <dig>  is more related to ldl <dig> . phylogenetic analysis with fld homologs from different plant species show that plant lsd <dig> homologs are divided into three subgroups: loc <dig>  is clustered with the arabidopsis fld, loc <dig>  is in the ldl <dig> cluster, and loc <dig>  and loc <dig>  belong to ldl <dig> cluster . hence, loc <dig>  is designated as gmfld, loc <dig>  is designated as gmldl <dig>  and loc <dig>  and loc <dig>  are designated as gmldl1a and gmldl1b, respectively.figure  <dig> 
phylogenetic tree of fld homologs from soybean and other plant species. the phylograph was generated by the neighbor-joining method using mega  <dig>   <cit> . bootstrap analysis was performed in  <dig> sampling replicates.



both gmfld and gmldl <dig> contain the swirm and amine oxidase domains  that are characteristic of the lsd <dig> group of histone demethylases  <cit> . the swirm and amino oxidase domains in gmfld and gmldl <dig> are organized in the same pattern as those in the arabidopsis fld and ldl2: swirm domain is at the n terminal while the c terminal contains the amine oxidase domain . however, in addition to the swirm and the amino oxidase domains, both gmldl1a and gmldl1b proteins contain new domains that are not present in the arabidopsis: ldl <dig>  ldl <dig> and fld . gmldl1a contains a nda-binding- <dig> domain between the swirm domain and the amino oxidase domain, while gmldl1b contains taxi-n and taxi-c domains at the n-terminal in front of the swirm domain. the nad-binding- <dig> domain is involved in coenzyme binding  <cit> , whereas the proteins containing taxi domains are associated with proteolysis of phytopathogen xylanase secreted by the pathogen to degrade plant cell wall during plant pathogen infection  <cit> . in addition, both gmldl1a and gmldl1b differ from the arabidopsis ldl <dig> in that the soybean genes have intron  according to the annotations at ncbi and jgi databases . taken together, gmldl1s probably diverged in functions from their counterpart ldl <dig> during evolution.figure  <dig>

gmfld and gmldl <dig> exhibit different expression patterns from their arabidopsis counterparts: fld and ldl2
as noted above, among soybean homologs of fld, gmfld and gmldl <dig> are more conserved in domain type and organization pattern than ldl1a and ldl1b. this suggests that the functions of gmfld and gmldl <dig> may be conserved in soybean. we thus examined whether gmfld and gmldl <dig> expressions in soybean have similar patterns with that of the arabidopsis fld and ldl <dig>  figure  <dig> shows that the transcripts of both genes could be detected in all tissues tested, including roots, hypocotyls and epicotyls, cotyledons, leaves, young pods, and flowers. this indicates that both genes are widely expressed in soybean. however, the transcript levels vary among different organs. the transcript abundance of both gmfld and gmldl <dig> was high in cotyledons, roots and pods, moderate in seedlings, hypocotyls and epicotyls, and flowers, and very low in true leaves, including unifoliate and trifoliate leaves . interestingly, levels of both gmfld and gmldl <dig> transcripts were also very low in the shoot apex , which is very different from previous reports showing that the arabidopsis fld and ldl <dig> are preferentially expressed in shoot apex  <cit> .figure  <dig>

both gmfld and gmldl <dig> proteins are localized in nuclei
as putative histone demethylases, gmfld and gmldl <dig> should function in the nucleus. however, a bioinformatics prediction at http://psort.hgc.jp/form.html showed that only gmfld has putative nuclear localization sites  and may localize in the nucleus, while gmldl <dig> was predicted to localize in the mitochondrial matrix space or cytoplasm. hence, a transient expression assay was performed to examine the subcellular localization of gmfld and gmldl <dig>  the constructs 35s::gmfld-yfp and 35s::gmldl2-yfp were used respectively to co-transform rice protoplasts with 35s::ghd7-cfp, a marker for nuclear localization  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows that yellow fluorescent protein  signals of both gmfld and gmldl <dig> were clearly overlapped with cyan fluorescent protein  signals, and no significant fluorescence signals were detected in the cytoplasm. this indicates that both gmfld and gmldl <dig> are localized in the nucleus. this subcellular localization pattern is consistent with the putative functions of gmfld and gmldl <dig> as histone demethylases.figure  <dig>

gmfld but not gmldl <dig> promotes flowering in a. thaliana
since gmfld and gmldl <dig> showed different expression patterns from their arabidopsis counterparts fld and ldl <dig> , we examined whether gmfld and gmldl <dig> could function as a flowering time control, similar to the arabidopsis fld. gmfld and gmldl <dig> cdss driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus  35s promoter were introduced into a. thaliana  to assess flowering phenotype of transgenic plants. the transgenic t <dig> plants expressing gmfld flowered significantly earlier than wild type plants , and the early flowering phenotype was also observed in the progenies of the t <dig> plants . in contrast to gmfld, the transgenic plants overexpressing gmldl <dig> did not show significant changes in flowering time .table  <dig>

gmfld complements the late flowering phenotype of fld mutant
since gmfld could promote flowering in the arabidopsis wild type background, we further checked whether gmfld could rescue the late flowering phenotype of the arabidopsis fld mutant. the 35s::gmfld construct was introduced into the fld mutant and in the t <dig> generation, most gmfld transgenic plants flowered as early as the col wild type plants . homozygous single-copy transgenic lines were screened from these early flowering transgenic plants for further analysis. flowering phenotype scoring showed that the progeny plants consistently flowered much earlier than the fld plants, but not as early as the col wild type plants . the fld mutants produced approximately  <dig>  ±  <dig>  leaves  before flowering while transgenic plants produced only  <dig>  ±  <dig>  leaves, and col wild type plants produced  <dig>  ±  <dig>  leaves. the lifecycle of the transgenic plants were also shortened. this was observed by evaluating the time when flower buds became visible or when flowers started to open . these results reveal that gmfld could partially complement the phenotype of the fld mutant. as expected, gmfld transcript could only be detected in those phenotype-complementary transgenic lines , whereas in those non-complementary transgenic plants , gmfld transcripts could not be detected although the transgene does exist in these transgenic t <dig> plants .

gmfld promotes flowering in a. thaliana through repressing flc transcription
in a. thaliana, fld promotes flowering through repressing flc transcription  <cit> . to assess whether gmfld promotes flowering through the same mechanism, the transcript levels of flc and the floral integrator genes, ft and soc <dig>  acting downstream of flc in the transgenic a. thaliana  were analyzed. in the transgenic plants in col background, flc transcript level decreased significantly while ft and soc <dig> were up-regulated, the soc <dig> level were especially increased . similar trends were observed in the transgenic plants in the fld background . hence, gmfld promotes flowering in a. thaliana through repressing flc transcription as its a. thaliana counterpart fld does. taken the above results together, our experiments demonstrate that gmfld is a functional homolog of the arabidopsis fld.

gmfld decreased the levels of histone h3k4me <dig> and h <dig> acetylation at the flc locus
in a. thaliana, fld represses flc transcription through affecting the state of h3k <dig> methylation and h <dig> acetylation  <cit> . so we examined the modification state of h3k <dig> and h <dig> in flc chromatin in the transgenic plants that rescued fld mutant phenotype. in the gmfld complementing plants, the level of h3k4me <dig> near the transcriptional start site  was significantly decreased, and was about half of that in the fld plants. however, we did not find significant changes in the level of h3k4me <dig> modification in other regions tested  , which is consistent with previous reports  <cit> . hence, gmfld could recover at least partially the h3k <dig> methylation levels of flc chromatin in the fld mutant. the acetylation level of h <dig> in the region around the flc transcription start site was also decreased significantly, whereas no obvious change was found in the p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> regions tested . these results suggest that gmfld represses flc transcription possibly through decreasing the modification levels of h3k4me <dig> and h <dig> acetylation in flc chromatin.figure  <dig>

discussion
soybean is a typical photoperiod-sensitive crop and photoperiod is an important factor that determines its flowering time. hence, since the whole genomic sequence of soybean was released  <cit> , the functions of many photoperiod pathway genes, including gmfts, gmcos and gmgis, have been identified and characterized  <cit> . however, little is known about the functions of autonomous pathway genes in soybean, although most of the a. thaliana autonomous pathway genes have more than one orthologs in soybean as predicted by bioinformatics analysis  <cit> . in this report, the functions of fld homologs in soybean were studied by using bioinformatics, genetic and molecular tools. our results provide solid evidence to support the function and evolution of autonomous pathway genes in plants.

gmfld is a functional homolog of fld
in a. thaliana, fld plays a major role in promoting flowering, while ldl <dig> and ldl <dig> play a minor role and act redundantly with fld  <cit> . in palaeopolyploid soybean, both fld and ldl <dig> only have a single ortholog, gmfld and gmldl <dig> respectively, and both have functional domains arranged in the same pattern as that in the arabidopsis fld and ldl <dig> . notably, gmfld could complement the late flowering phenotype of the a. thaliana fld mutant plants . in the transgenic plants, flc expression is down-regulated and the downstream floral integrator genes soc <dig> and ft are up-regulated . to our knowledge, no fld homologs from other plants have been experimentally identified and characterized, although the homologs of several other autonomous pathway genes, including osfca and osfve of rice, bvfve and bvflk of beta vulgaris, and zmld of maize  <cit> , were studied. among them, only bvflk and osfve could complement the late-flowering phenotype of arabidopsis flk or fve mutant through flc repression  <cit> . our chip assay further demonstrates that gmfld is involved in the regulation of the chromatin modification state at flc locus . hence gmfld operated in the transgenic a. thaliana in the same manner as the native fld does  <cit> . although flc orthologs were not identified in leguminous plants previously  <cit> , a recent comparative genomic analysis of soybean flowering genes indicated that soybean has an flc homolog, gmflc   <cit> . whether gmflc is the target of gmfld and  other autonomous pathway genes is unknown at present. however from our results, it is reasonable to propose that gmfld may repress its target gene expression through regulation of the chromatin modification state to control flowering in soybean. our results suggest that fld and gmfld are functionally related regulators of the chromatin modification state and provide the first experimental evidence for evolutionary conservation of fld function between arabidopsis and soybean.

functional conservation and divergence of fld homologs in soybean
fld was identified to physically interact with hda <dig>  a histone deacetylase involved in gene silencing, to function synergistically in chromatin modification  <cit> . in the complementing transgenic plants, both the h3k4me <dig> and h <dig> acetylation levels decreased as compared to those in the fld mutant . this result suggests that, in addition to its histone demethylase function, gmfld may also interact with histone deacetylase to affect histone acetylation in chromatin. however, in our preliminary study, interaction between gmfld and the soybean hda <dig> homologs was not detected by yeast two-hybrid analysis . furthermore, the expression pattern of gmfld in soybean is somewhat different from that of fld in a. thaliana. the arabidopsis fld is preferentially expressed in apical meristem regions of roots and shoots, but the transcript level of gmfld is very low in the shoot apex of soybean . the key function of fld in a. thaliana is to promote flowering through repressing the expression of flc, which is epigenetically silenced by vernalization  <cit> . different from a. thaliana, soybean does not require vernalization to induce flowering. therefore, it is conceivable that gmfld probably has additional functions other than flowering control in soybean. further characterization of the soybean gmfld will be performed in our future work.

in a. thaliana, ldl <dig> acts redundantly with fld and ldl <dig> to repress flc expression, and ldl <dig> also has overlapping function with ldl <dig> to repress sporophytic expression of fwa  <cit> . however, ldl <dig> itself plays a minor role in promoting flowering of a. thaliana, and loss-of-function ldl <dig> mutants do not have significant phenotypic changes  <cit> . this may explain why heterologous expression of gmldl <dig> in a. thaliana did not result in significant flowering phenotype changes. based on its sequence similarity with ldl <dig> , nuclear localization  and expression pattern similar to that of gmfld , we propose that gmldl <dig> is the functional ortholog of ldl <dig> and probably acts redundantly with gmfld to repress the gene expression in soybean. however, its biological roles in soybean still require further investigation. soybean appears to have two ldl <dig> orthologs, gmldl1a and gmldl1b. interestingly, gmldl1a and gmldl1b gained additional functional domains during evolution. the occurrence of taxi-n and taxi-c domains in gmldl1b also suggests functions in pathogen resistance  <cit> .

functional divergence of autonomous pathway genes
autonomous pathway genes were originally identified from a group of a. thaliana late flowering mutants and their homologs apparently exist widely in plant kingdom  <cit> . as for fld, two homologs were identified in the genome of physcomitrella patens , a cryptogam without floral transition. this suggests that some fld homologs may play pivotal roles in other developmental processes other than flowering. in cells, autonomous pathway components are involved in chromatin modification and rna processing, which play important roles in multiple physiological processes such as growth and development, response to abiotic stress, etc.  <cit> . therefore, it is not surprising that some autonomous pathway genes have additional functions in regulating growth and developmental processes other than flowering. for example, double mutant plants, fpa fld, fpa fve, and fpa ld showed pleiotropic effects on growth rate, chlorophyll content, leaf morphology, flower development, and fertility  <cit> . furthermore, some experimental evidence show that both fca and fve play a role in thermosensory flowering pathway  <cit> , whereas fy is involved in the development of seed dormancy and aba sensitivity in a. thaliana  <cit> . on the other hand, some orthologs of the a. thaliana autonomous pathway genes from other species appear to have diversified in function and/or acting mechanism. rice fca homolog osfca could partially rescue the late flowering phenotype of the arabidopsis fca mutant, but through the activation of soc <dig> rather than flc down-regulation. the osfca also does not have a negative feedback to regulate the osfca mrna level as the arabidopsis fca does  <cit> . in addition, osfca has interaction partners in rice, including ossf <dig>  osfik <dig> and osmads <dig>  <cit>  that were not identified in arabidopsis. bvfve <dig> of sugarbeet showed 72% amino acid identity to fve, but could not complement the phenotype of the arabidopsis fve mutant  <cit> , whereas maize zmld not only failed to complement the ld phenotype, but resulted in other developmental defects in a. thaliana  <cit> . taken the above together, the biological functions of autonomous pathway genes are complex and it is of great interest to probe the biological functions of autonomous pathway components in other plants in addition to a. thaliana. our present data provide the first evidence for evolutionary conservation of the components in the autonomous pathway of flowering in soybean.

CONCLUSIONS
in soybean, fld has four homologs, gmfld, gmldl <dig>  gmldl1a, and gmldl1b. gmfld is a functional ortholog of the arabidopsis fld and may play an important role in regulation of the chromatin modifying state in soybean. gmldl <dig> is a functional ortholog of ldl <dig> and may function redundantly with gmfld in soybean.
