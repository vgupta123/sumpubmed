BACKGROUND
l-arginine metabolism is more complex than the majority of other metabolic pathways in living organisms. this is due to  the occurrence of a biosynthetic branch point at the level of carbamoylphosphate, a precursor for l-arginine and pyrimidine biosynthesis,  the fact that l-arginine is a potential precursor of polyamines,  the fact that l-arginine can be a precursor of 4-aminobutyrate, having a role as neurotransmitter in mammals,  the function of l-arginine as a precursor for nitric oxide, acting as an abundant signal molecule in bacteria, mammals, and plants, and  the existence of an impressive variety of l-arginine-degrading pathways in eubacteria and archaea. compared to heterotrophically-growing prokaryotes, l-arginine has specific additional roles in cyanobacteria, because some strains have an alternative carbon dioxide fixation pathway with carbamoylphosphate as the first carbon dioxide fixation product. this pathway leads to the formation of l-citrulline and subsequently to l-arginine  <cit> . moreover, a number of cyanobacteria is able to synthesize the polymer cyanophycin , which consists of an aspartic acid backbone with l-arginine residues being attached to the β-carboxyl group of aspartate by isopeptide bonds  <cit> . cyanophycin has been shown to have a complex dynamic metabolism, which is not yet completely understood  <cit> .

l-arginine serves as a source of nitrogen, carbon, and energy through a variety of catabolic pathways in archaea and eubacteria  <cit> . in eubacteria, six major l-arginine-degrading pathways have been described . the first enzymes of these six pathways are an arginase, an l-arginine deiminase, an l-arginine decarboxylase, an l-arginine amidino-transferase, an l-arginine succinyl transferase, and an l-arginine oxidase/dehydrogenase, respectively. heterotrophically growing bacteria contain either only one of these pathways or have multiple catabolic pathways, as e.g. shown for several pseudomonas species  <cit> . in pseudomonas putida and pseudomonas aeruginosa four l-arginine-degrading pathways are functional. the l-arginine succinyl transferase pathway and the l-arginine deiminase pathway serve as major routes of l-arginine catabolism under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively. in addition, an l-arginine oxidase/dehydrogenase pathway also contributes to l-arginine catabolism under aerobic conditions. the role of a fourth pathway, the l-arginine decarboxylase pathway, still remains somewhat unclear. although it may provide ammonium from l-arginine, it does not seem to play a major role in l-arginine utilization as carbon source. it may have its major function in the biosynthesis of the polyamines agmatine and putrescine  <cit> .

the understanding of cyanobacterial l-arginine catabolism is scarce and only a few studies on l-arginine-degrading enzymes exist. this work includes the detection of arginase and l-arginine deiminase activity in anabaena cylindrica   <cit> , anabaena variabilis  <cit> , aphanocapsa pcc  <dig>  <cit> , and nostoc sp. pcc  <dig>  <cit> . in synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> two genes encoding ureohydrolase-type enzymes  have been identified using bioinformatic tools  <cit> . l-ornithine was detected as a major initial product of l-arginine degradation. based on the detected products, a model of l-arginine catabolism with a putative arginase as the first enzyme has been proposed  <cit> . in this model l-arginine degradation via arginase is suggested to lead to l-ornithine as first product and subsequently to the production of l-glutamate, and also l-proline. since l-citrulline and a minor amount of argininosuccinate were also detected as products, an urea cycle-type pathway, besides an arginase pathway, was included in the model  <cit> .

in the two closely related strains synechococcus elongatus pcc  <dig> and pcc  <dig> an l-amino acid oxidase  with a high specificity for basic l-amino acids and with l-arginine as preferred substrate has been partially characterized  <cit> . recently, such an enzyme has also been identified by enzymatic activity tests in synechococcus cedrorum pcc  <dig>  <cit> . the aoxa genes in synechococcus elongatus pcc  <dig> and pcc  <dig> have also been identified  <cit> .

since l-arginine catabolism in heterotrophically growing eubacteria is very diverse and since the knowledge on l-arginine catabolism in cyanobacteria is rather limited, the genomes of  <dig> cyanobacterial strains were screened for the presence of genes encoding putative l-arginine-degrading enzymes in order to obtain an overview on l-arginine catabolism in cyanobacteria. we chose synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> as a model organism and validated the results of our bioinformatic analysis for this strain with a transcript analysis. we chose synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig>  because results on the products of l-arginine degradation have been published more recently  <cit> .

RESULTS
evaluation of  <dig> cyanobacterial genomes for the presence of genes encoding enzymes of l-arginine-degrading pathways
we used a bioinformatic approach to analyze  <dig> cyanobacterial strains with fully sequenced and annotated genomes for the presence of genes encoding putative enzymes being involved in the degradation of l-arginine. among the marine cyanobacteria, the genomes of six prochlorococcus and six synechococcus species as well as the genomes of two n2-fixing species  were investigated. the investigated freshwater cyanobacteria included three mesophilic strains, synechococcus elongatus pcc  <dig>  synechococcus elongatus pcc  <dig>  and synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig>  and three thermophilic strains, thermosynechococcus elongatus bp- <dig>  and two synechococcus yellowstone species. the latter two thermophilic strains are capable of n2-fixation with a diurnal rhythm. moreover, three heterocyst-forming n2-fixing species anabaena variabilis atcc  <dig>  nostoc sp. pcc  <dig>  and nostoc punctiforme pcc  <dig> as well as gloeobacter violaceus pcc  <dig>  a strain which lacks thylakoid membranes, were investigated. the origins of the evaluated cyanobacterial genome sequences are listed in table  <dig>  sequences of genes encoding enzymes involved in l-arginine degradation in various archaea and heterotrophically growing eubacteria were used to identify corresponding genes in cyanobacteria . the results of the bioinformatic analyses of the  <dig> cyanobacterial genomes are given in tables  <dig> and  <dig> 

*jgi, joint genome research institute; doe, department of energy usa; whoi, woods hole oceanographic institute; mit, massachusetts institute of technology; tigr, the institute for genomic research. the strain prochlorococcus marinus ss  <dig> corresponds to prochlorococcus marinus subsp. marinus str. ccmp  <dig> and strain prochlorococcus marinus med  <dig> corresponds to prochlorococcus marinus subsp.pastoris str. ccmp  <dig> or ccmp  <dig>  nostoc sp. pcc  <dig> is synonymous to anabaena sp. pcc  <dig> as well as anabaena cylindrica. n.d. = not detected.

a sequence from synechococcus sp. yellowstone b ja-2-3b'a 2– <dig> was used to screen for l-arginine amidinotransferase sequences. the screen for l-arginine oxidase/dehydrogenases was performed with the aoxa sequence from synechococcus elongatus pcc 6301/pcc  <dig> 

l-ornithine is formed from l-arginine by the enzymes arginase or l-arginine amidinotransferase. it is also formed in the 2nd reaction of the l-arginine deiminase pathway. enzymes a <dig> and e <dig> are identical enzymes and both represent a 4-aminobutyrate transaminase. enzymes a <dig> and e <dig> are identical and both represent a succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase . enzymes a <dig> , b <dig>  and c <dig> represent ureohydrolases, and the same gene is  annotated as an agmatinase , an arginase  or a 4-guanidinobutyrase . the genes encoding the enzymes c <dig> and d <dig> are annotated as l-arginine amidinotransferase as well as l-arginine deiminase . n.d. = not detected.

in total, we found evidence for the presence of five putative pathways for l-arginine catabolism in the investigated genomes. these are an l-arginine decarboxylase pathway, an arginase pathway, an l-arginine amidinotransferase pathway, an l-arginine deiminase pathway, and an l-arginine oxidase/dehydrogenase pathway. these pathways are outlined , and the accession numbers of the corresponding genes are given as supplement in tables  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  no evidence has been found for the presence of an l-arginine succinyl transferase pathway.

l-arginine decarboxylase pathway
one or several genes encoding l-arginine decarboxylase-type enzymes, which catalyze the formation of agmatine from l-arginine, are present in all investigated cyanobacteria . a putative agmatinase that converts agmatine to putrescine and urea is present in nineteen cyanobacterial strains. no such gene was identified in crocosphaera watsonii wh  <dig>  synechococcus elongatus pcc  <dig>  synechococcus elongatus pcc  <dig>  thermosynechococcus elongatus bp- <dig>  and gloeobacter violaceus pcc  <dig>  these strains, with the exception of crocosphaera watsonii wh  <dig>  convert agmatine to putrescine via an agmatine deiminase and an n-carbamoylputrescine hydrolase. since in none of the investigated cyanobacteria a putrescine oxidase or a putrescine transaminase encoding gene has been found, we consider the l-arginine decarboxylase pathway to be mainly responsible for the synthesis of the polyamines agmatine and putrescine as well as for production of ammonium from l-arginine. putrescine can subsequently be converted to spermidine or spermine. evidence for the utilization of putrescine by γ-glutamylation like in e. coli  <cit>  was not found. however, since transaminases frequently show broad substrate specificity, we can not entirely exclude that a rather unspecific transaminase, which is not annotated as a putrescine transaminase, catalyzes the conversion of putrescine to 4-aminobutyr aldehyde. the subsequent dehydrogenase that converts the aldehyde to 4-aminobutyrate is present in  <dig> of the  <dig> investigated strains. such an enzyme is absent in synechococcus sp. wh  <dig>  the two enzymes, which catalyze the conversion of 4-aminobutyrate to succinate  are present in all  <dig> strains. however, since 4-aminobutyrate also is an intermediate of the l-amino oxidase/dehydrogenase pathway and can additionally be formed by decarboxylation of l-glutamate, the presence of genes encoding the latter two enzymes not necessarily implies that a complete l-arginine decarboxylase pathway is present. therefore, the question whether the l-arginine decarboxylase pathway only provides polyamines and ammonium or also allows for utilization of l-arginine as c-source can not be answered on the basis of the bioinformatic considerations.

a phylogenetic tree of the l-arginine decarboxylases, which are present in the investigated cyanobacterial genomes, is given  and shows that the cyanobacterial l-arginine decarboxylases cluster into four distinct groups. the clusters marked in green and yellow exclusively contain l-arginine decarboxylases of the marine non-n2-fixing strains, while the red and blue clusters contain l-arginine decarboxylases of freshwater cyanobacteria and of the two marine n2-fixing species crocosphaera watsonii and trichodesmium erythraeum ims <dig>  it should be pointed out that in species with more than several l-arginine decarboxylase the corresponding enzymes always group into two different clusters. thus, the marine as well as the fresh water cyanobacteria seem to have two distinct types of l-arginine decarboxylases.

it has previously been shown by sandmeier et al.  <cit>  that amino acid decarboxylases in general can be subdivided into four different groups. these groups seem to be evolutionary unrelated to each other. in these subdivisions, the groups iii and iv contain decarboxylases with specificity for basic l-amino acids. in addition, there is evidence that e. coli has two different l-arginine decarboxylases – a biosynthetic and a biodegradable form. the biodegradable l-arginine decarboxylase  is only induced in large amounts when cells are grown in rich medium containing l-arginine, while the biosynthetic enzyme  is expressed constitutively  <cit> . on the basis of this classification, the red and green clusters  contain l-arginine decarboxylases being more similar to group iv l-arginine decarboxylases, while the blue and yellow clusters contain l-arginine decarboxylases with higher similarity to group iii l-arginine decarboxylases. the similarity of the biodegradable and the biosynthetic l-arginine decarboxylase of e. coli to selected marine and fresh water cyanobacterial l-arginine decarboxylases is presented in table  <dig>  e.g. the l-arginine decarboxylases slr <dig> and slr <dig> of synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> in the red cluster have a higher similarity to the biosynthetic l-arginine decarboxylase  of group iv than to the biodegradable l-arginine decarboxylase p <dig> of group iii. in contrast, sll <dig> of synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> has a higher similarity to p <dig>  than to p <dig>  . thus, it is likely that the green and the red cluster  contain l-arginine decarboxylases of the biosynthetic-type, while the yellow and blue clusters contain l-arginine decarboxylases of the biodegradative type.

p <dig> represents a biodegradable and inducible l-arginine decarboxylase ; p <dig> represents a biosynthetic and constitutively expressed l-arginine decarboxylase  in e. coli  <cit> . score values were calculated with the clustalw software  <cit> . the l-arginine decarboxylases in the yellow, blue, green, and red cluster are identical to those l-arginine decarboxylases given in fig.  <dig> 

arginase pathway
urea is released from l-arginine by an arginase in the arginase pathway, and the resulting l-ornithine is further catabolized to l-glutamate by l-ornithine transaminase and Δ1pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase . in the presence of urease, urea is further degraded to ammonium. the arginase pathway seems to be widely distributed among the investigated cyanobacteria. genes encoding the putative second and third enzyme of this pathway, the l-ornithine transaminase and the Δ1pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase, are present in all  <dig> investigated cyanobacteria. a gene encoding a putative arginase is only present in  <dig> of the investigated genomes . such a gene is absent in crocosphaera watsonii wh  <dig>  synechococcus elongatus pcc  <dig>  synechococcus elongatus pcc  <dig>  thermosynechococcus elongatus bp- <dig>  and gloeobacter violaceus pcc  <dig>  the likely absence of an arginase-type enzyme in five of the investigated  <dig> cyanobacterial strains is somewhat surprising, since arginases have been shown to be present in all so far investigated higher plants  <cit> . however, since plant-type arginases represent a distinct group of ureohydrolases  <cit>   and localize in mitochondria  <cit> , they may have originated from the predecessor organism, which gave rise to the evolutionary lineage of mitochondria.

l-arginine amidinotransferase pathway
in addition to arginases, l-ornithine may also be synthesized by l-arginine amidinotransferases . a gene for such an enzyme was detected in the n2-fixing species nostoc sp. pcc  <dig>  nostoc punctiforme pcc  <dig>  anabaena variabilis atcc  <dig>  trichodesmium erythraeum ims  <dig>  crocosphaera watsonii wh  <dig>  synechococcus yellowstone sp. ja-2-3ba' , and in the non-n <dig> fixing cyanobacteria synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig>  thermosynechococcus elongatus bp- <dig>  and gloeobacter violaceus pcc  <dig> . three of the five cyanobacteria without an arginase-type enzyme have a putative l-arginine amidinotransferase-type enzyme . thus, synechococcus elongatus pcc  <dig> and pcc  <dig> are probably the only cyanobacterial strains among the  <dig> investigated ones, which are unable to form l-ornithine from l-arginine. interestingly, they have a very active l-amino acid oxidase  with high specificity for basic amino acids and a preference for l-arginine, utilizing molecular oxygen as an electron acceptor  <cit> .

l-arginine deiminase pathway
the l-arginine deiminase pathway is widely distributed among eubacteria and archaea  <cit>  and has also been discovered in a few primitive eukaryotes, e.g. in giardia intestinalis  <cit> , trichomonas vaginalis  <cit> , and tritrichomonas foetus  <cit> . however, it has so far not been detected in multi-cellular organisms. the l-arginine deiminase pathway consists of three enzymes and catalyzes the production of atp in its final enzymatic step. the first enzyme of this pathway is an l-arginine deiminase, which irreversibly converts l-arginine to l-citrulline and ammonium. the second and third enzymes are an l-ornithine transcarbamoylase and a carbamate kinase, respectively . a gene encoding a putative l-arginine deiminase was detected in the n2-fixing species nostoc sp. pcc  <dig>  nostoc punctiforme pcc  <dig>  anabaena variabilis atcc  <dig>  trichodesmium erythraeum ims  <dig>  crocosphaera watsonii wh  <dig>  and synechococcus yellowstone sp. ja-2-3ba' 2– <dig> as well as in the non-n <dig> fixing cyanobacteria synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig>  thermosynechococcus elongatus bp- <dig>  and gloeobacter violaceus pcc  <dig> . this gene is the same as the one being annotated encoding a putative l-arginine amidinotransferase . an l-ornithine transcarbamoylase is present in all investigated cyanobacteria. since the majority of the investigated cyanobacteria have two genes encoding a putative l-ornithine transcarbamoylase, it is likely that they contain a catabolic and an anabolic enzyme  <cit> . surprisingly, a carbamate kinase, which catalyzes the last step of the deiminase pathway, has only been detected in synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig>  an l-arginine deiminase activity has previously been detected in anabaena cylindrica  <cit> , anabaena variabilis  <cit> , nostoc sp. pcc  <dig>  <cit> , and aphanocapsa pcc  <dig>  <cit> .

l-arginine oxidase/dehydrogenase pathway
the fifth putative l-arginine catabolic pathway starts with an l-arginine oxidase/dehydrogenase-type enzyme. in this pathway l-arginine is converted to succinate via 2-ketoarginine, 4-guanidinobutyrate, and 4-aminobutyrate with a concomitant production of ammonium, carbon dioxide, and urea . ten out of  <dig> cyanobacterial species have one or two gene encoding an l-arginine oxidase/dehydrogenase , which is similar to an l-amino acid oxidase that is present in the two closely related strains synechococcus elongatus pcc  <dig> and pcc  <dig>  <cit> . the corresponding l-amino acid oxidase of these two cyanobacteria is encoded by the aoxa genes yp_ <dig> and zp_ <dig> for synechococcus elongatus pcc  <dig> and pcc  <dig>  respectively, and has been purified and partially characterized. this aoxa has a high specificity for basic l-amino acids as substrate with a preference for l-arginine. aoxa converts l-arginine to 2-ketoarginine and ammonium and utilizes oxygen as electron acceptor. when hydrogen peroxide is not removed by hydrogen peroxide decomposing enzymes, 2-ketoarginine is converted to 4-guanidinobutyrate in a non-enzymatic reaction. seven of the  <dig> cyanobacteria, which have a putative l-arginine oxidase/dehydrogenase, also have a gene encoding a putative 4-guanidino butyrase , while the enzyme is absent in synechococcus elongatus pcc  <dig>  synechococcus elongatus pcc  <dig>  and gloeobacter violaceus pcc  <dig>  the genes encoding the two enzymes which convert 4-aminobutyrate to succinate  are present in all investigated cyanobacteria. the fact that 4-aminobutyrate is also an intermediate in the l-arginine decarboxylase pathway and can additionally be formed by decarboxylation of l-glutamate might explain the presence of these two enzymes even in those cyanobacteria that do not have an l-arginine oxidase/dehydrogenase. an l-arginine oxidase/dehydrogenase pathway, converting l-arginine to 4-aminobutyrate, was first described on the basis of detected products for streptomyces griseus  <cit>  and is also present in pseudomonas putida  migula p <dig> atcc  <dig>  however, the first enzyme has not yet been characterized biochemically  <cit> .

l-arginine succinyl transferase pathway
we did not find evidence for the presence of an l-arginine succinyl transferase pathway in the genome sequences of the investigated  <dig> cyanobacterial strains. this pathway is suggested to be mainly limited to those heterotrophically growing eubacteria that have the ability to use l-arginine as both, a nitrogen and a carbon source  <cit> .

problems related to the bioinformatic analysis
all  <dig> investigated cyanobacterial genomes have a putative l-arginine decarboxylase pathway and one or several additional l-arginine-degrading pathways. these can either be an arginase pathway, an l-arginine amidinotransferase pathway, an l-arginine deiminase or an l-arginine oxidase/dehydrogenase pathway. thus, all investigated cyanobacteria have at least two putative l-arginine-degrading pathways. however, the performed similarity searches do not always allow a statement whether all enzymes of the corresponding pathways are present and whether the gene products have indeed the enzymatic activity that has been assigned to them on the basis of the corresponding similarity searches and domain predictions. no matter what similarity search results suggest, a proof is only provided by activity measurements with purified enzymes. therefore, uncertainties related to this aspect will be briefly discussed with respect to the enzymes being annotated as ureohydrolases  <cit>  and enzymes being annotated as l-arginine amidinotransferases or l-arginine deiminases. the latter two types of enzymes belong to the family of guanidino group modifiers  <cit> .

ureohydrolases
the bioinformatic evaluation of the  <dig> cyanobacterial genome sequences suggests the presence of  gene encoding an arginase, an agmatinase, or a 4-guanidino butyrase in  <dig> cyanobacterial genomes. five cyanobacterial species have neither an arginase- nor an agmatinase- nor a 4-guanidino butyrase-encoding gene . arginases, agmatinases, and 4-guanidino butyrases release urea from l-arginine , agmatine  or 4-guanidino butyrate , respectively. all three types of enzymes belong to the group of ureohydrolases , require the cofactor manganese, and might have an identical evolutionary origin. this implies that an ancient enzyme with broad substrate specificity has progressively been evolved to gain narrower substrate specificity during evolution. therefore, it is extremely difficult to annotate these genes correctly with respect to the nature of their true substrate  <cit> . according to sekowska et al.  <cit> , we constructed a phylogenetic distance tree  with  <dig> sequences of arginases or agmatinases  as well as the sequences of two arginases from arabidopsis thaliana and the sequences of cyanobacterial ureohydrolases . the eukaryotic non-plant arginases cluster in one group , while the majority of the cyanobacterial enzymes form two clusters containing either the enzymes from marine cyanobacteria  or from freshwater cyanobacteria . the two plant arginases form a separate group  <cit>  and are more closely related to agmatinases  than to the arginases from non-photosynthetic organisms of the red cluster. the green cluster contains 4-guanidino butyrases from pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas putida  and the cyanobacterial enzyme sll <dig> of synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig>  as well as the enzymes of synechococcus sp. cc  <dig>  synechococcus sp. wh  <dig>  and synechococcus sp. wh  <dig>  the similarity of these cyanobacterial enzymes to known 4-guanidino butyrases  <cit>  suggests that these enzymes also have a 4-guanidino butyrase activity . since all other cyanobacterial ureohydrolases group into two separate clusters , it is likely that they do not represent 4-guanidino butyrases, but represent either an arginase or an agmatinase or an enzyme with both activities – albeit with different substrate affinities. it has been shown that the two arginases of lycopersicon esculentum , which have an arginase activity, also have a very low agmatinase activity   <cit> . since the blue cluster contains sll <dig> of synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig>  which has been shown to encode an agmatinase  <cit> , it is likely that at least some of the enzymes in the blue cluster are true agmatinases. to further investigate the real activity of the putative cyanobacterial ureohydrolases, the expression of the corresponding proteins in e. coli is required to allow activity measurements as was done for sll <dig> and sll <dig> of synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig>  although originally being annotated as arginases, neither sll <dig> nor sll <dig> have arginase activity  <cit> . sll <dig> has been shown to have agmatinase activity, while sll <dig> has neither arginase nor an agmatinase activity  <cit>  and thus, most likely is a 4-guanidino butyrase .

n.d. = not detected. *these ureohydrolases are annotated as arginases, as agmatinases as well as 4-guanidino butyrases. the  in table  <dig> for a <dig> , b <dig>  and e <dig> refers to an identical gene, because the gene annotation does not distinguish between arginases, agmatinases, and 4-guanidino butyrases. a classification is only possible in a few cases, in which enzymatic activity has been measured or the similarity values are very high to already biochemically well-characterized enzymes .

l-arginine deiminases and l-arginine amidinotransferases belong to a superfamily of enzymes that catalyze the modification of guanidino groups. the number of amino acid residues, the molecular mass, and the calculated isoelectric point is given. moreover, the similarity of the selected reference enzymes to sll <dig> from synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> is given. values for % identity and similarity to sll <dig> were determined with the emboss pairwise alignment algorithm  <cit> . the percentage identity and similarity does not include weakly similar amino acid residues.

identification of genes encoding enzymes of l-arginine catabolizing pathways in synechocystis sp. pcc 6803
we chose synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> as a model organism to present more details on the enzymes of the l-arginine-degrading pathways and to validate the bioinformatic results by a transcript analysis. the reason for choosing this cyanobacterium is based on previously published results, showing that synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> possesses a very effective uptake system for l-arginine  <cit> . moreover, several products of l-arginine degradation have already been identified  <cit> . in addition, substantial differences in the utilization of l-arginine as sole n-source in the growth medium have been observed between synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> wt and a psbo-free synechocystis mutant  <cit> .

synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> contains genes encoding enzymes of a putative l-arginine decarboxylase pathway, an l-arginine deiminase pathway, and an l-arginine oxidase/dehydrogenase pathway .

the letters with numbers in parenthesis behind the enzyme names correspond to those given in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  and fig.  <dig>  in synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> the gene slr <dig> has similarity to l-ornithine transaminases and to 4-aminobutyrate transaminases. the l-ornithine transferase  and the 4-aminobutyrate transferase  both belong to the group of class iii aminotransferases , which explains why the same gene slr <dig> is annotated either as l-ornithine transaminase or as 4-aminobutyrate transaminase. the gene slr <dig> has similarity to the Δ1pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase  and to succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase . both enzymes belong to the nad-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenases , which explains why the same gene slr <dig> is either annotated as Δ1pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase or succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase thus, it can not be decided in a bioinformatic approach whether the gene products slr <dig> and slr <dig> are components of the l-arginine deiminase pathway or the l-arginine oxidase/dehydrogenase pathway or of both pathways. n.d. = not detected.

three genes, sll <dig>  slr <dig>  and slr <dig>  encoding enzymes with similarity to l-arginine decarboxylases, are present. as shown in table  <dig>  sll <dig> has a higher similarity to the biodegradable than to the biosynthetic l-arginine decarboxylase of e. coli. in contrast, slr <dig> and slr <dig> have higher similarity to the biosynthetic than to the biodegradable enzyme. moreover, two genes, sll <dig> and sll <dig>  encoding proteins with similarity to ureohydrolases, were detected. sll <dig>  but not sll <dig>  has been shown to have agmatinase activity, catalyzing the synthesis of putrescine  <cit> . however, no true putrescine oxidase or putrescine transaminase encoding genes were found in the genome of synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig>  therefore, the l-arginine decarboxylase pathway may mainly serve as a route for polyamine biosynthesis and for the production of ammonium from l-arginine. this assumption is in agreement with results obtained for pseudomonads, which were shown to an l-arginine decarboxylase pathway  <cit> .

sll <dig> has the common features of an l-arginine amidinotransferase as well as of an l-arginine deiminase. however, since l-arginine amidinotransferases are predominantly involved in antibiotic or toxin synthesis in prokaryotes, it is more likely that sll <dig> is an l-arginine deiminase. this is supported by the fact that sll <dig> has a slightly higher similarity to sequenced l-arginine deiminases than to l-arginine amidinotransferases . the highest similarity of sll <dig>  exists to the l-arginine deiminase arca from giardia intestinales . thus, sll <dig>  is substantially larger than the average l-arginine deiminases of primitive eukaryotes  or of heterotrophically growing prokaryotes  . in contrast to the bacterial enzymes, the l-arginine deiminase of synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig>  also has two putative transmembrane helices in the c-terminal region between the amino acid residues  <dig> to  <dig> and between the amino acid residues  <dig> and  <dig> . the prediction was carried out with three different software packages .

like all other investigated cyanobacteria, synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> has an l-ornithine transcarbamoylase , but it is the only species among the investigated strains, which has a gene encoding a carbamate kinase . this enzyme shows an intriguingly high degree of similarity to carbamate kinases from other eubacteria. sll <dig>  has an overall similarity of 71%  to the carbamate kinase arcc from enterococcus faecalis  and an overall similarity of 82%  to arcc from pseudomonas aeruginosa  . thus, it is likely that the second possible route for l-arginine degradation in synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> is an l-arginine deiminase pathway leading to synthesis of l-citrulline and subsequently to l-ornithine, carbon dioxide, ammonium, and atp . l-ornithine becomes further metabolized to l-glutamate by an l-ornithine transaminase  and a Δ1pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase  . this pathway also leads to the synthesis of l-proline via a Δ1pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase , and l-proline can be converted back to this intermediate by a proline oxidase   <cit> .

the third possible route of l-arginine catabolism in synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> may be an l-arginine oxidase/dehydrogenase pathway. the gene slr <dig> encodes a putative l-arginine oxidase/dehydrogenase, sll <dig> and sll <dig> encode putative ureohydrolases, slr <dig> and sll <dig> encode putative 4-aminobutyrate transaminases, and slr <dig>  sll <dig>  and slr <dig> encode putative succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenases. thus, l-arginine becomes degraded to succinate, carbon dioxide, and ammonium, via 2-ketoarginine, 4-guanidinobutyrate, and 4-aminobutyrate. since the ureohydrolase sll <dig> groups with known 4-guanidino butyrases , and the heterologously expressed enzyme has neither an arginase nor an agmatinase activity  <cit> , this enzyme may indeed be a 4-guanidino butyrase. an alignment of the enzyme with the biochemically identified 4-guanidino butyrase of pseudomonas putida strain f <dig>  is given .

the first enzyme of the l-arginine oxidase/dehydrogenase pathway  in synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> has 58% similarity  to an l-amino acid oxidase  from synechococcus elongatus pcc  <dig>  encoded by the aoxa gene   <cit> . this enzyme catalyzes the oxidative deamination of basic l-amino acids with a preference for l-arginine. an alignment of slr <dig> with aoxa of synechococcus elongatus pcc  <dig> is given and shows that slr <dig> has a dinucleotide-binding site   <cit>  like the aoxa enzyme . thus, slr <dig> may also be a fad-containing enzyme. since we were never able to detect an l-arginine oxidizing activity with utilization of molecular oxygen in intact cells or cell extracts of synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> so far , it is more likely that slr <dig> interacts in a complex not yet understood way with the electron transport chain. this is in agreement with the fact that the enzyme has two hydrophobic regions possibly being transmembrane helices. we would like to also point out that synechococcus elongatus pcc  <dig> has an additional gene encoding a protein called aoxb , which has 59% similarity  to aoxa  <cit> . aoxb has not yet been characterized biochemically. slr <dig> of synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> has a higher similarity to aoxb  than to aoxa . it should also be mentioned that the genomes of different pseudomonas species contain a gene encoding an enzyme, which has similarity to slr <dig> . the similarity of slr <dig> to the enzyme of p. fluorescens corresponds to 47% . all these enzymes contain a dinucleotide-binding gxgxxg motif and thus, are likely fad-containing dehydrogenases and not aminotransferases  <cit> . for pseudomonas putida  migula p <dig> atcc  <dig> the rodwell group has indeed suggested that an l-amino acid oxidase is the first enzyme degrading l-arginine via 2-ketoarginine, 4-guanidinobutyrate, and 4-aminobutyrate to succinate  <cit> .

detection of transcripts for l-arginine-degrading enzymes in synechocystis sp. pcc 6803
the bioinformatic evaluation suggests the presence of three putative l-arginine-degrading pathways in synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig>  these putative pathways are an l-arginine decarboxylase pathway , an l-arginine deiminase pathway , and an l-arginine oxidase/dehydrogenase pathway  .

for detection of the corresponding transcripts, synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> was cultivated with nitrate or with l-arginine as sole n-source and with an illumination of  <dig> μmol photons m- <dig> s- <dig> for three days. these growth conditions were similar to those published previously  <cit>  for experiments to determine products of l-arginine degradation. the growth curves and the chlorophyll content are given in fig.  <dig>  synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> grew about equally well with nitrate as with l-arginine. total rna was isolated from the corresponding cultures and was applied to rna slot-blot hybridization with selected dig-dutp-labeled gene-specific dna probes . equal length, concentration, almost equal gc-content of the probes, and equal exposure time allowed for semi-quantitative comparison of mrna levels of all five investigated transcripts: sll <dig>  sll <dig>  and slr <dig> encoding isoenzymes of l-arginine decarboxylases, sll <dig> encoding an l-arginine deiminase, and slr <dig> encoding an l-arginine oxidase/dehydrogenase. the transcript level for the three l-arginine decarboxylase-encoding genes was low when the cells grew with nitrate and did not or only slightly increase when the cells grew with l-arginine as sole n-source. a low steady-state mrna level was also observed for sll <dig> transcript , which encodes an agmatinase-type enzyme  <cit>  – the second enzyme in the l-arginine decarboxylase pathway. this implies that the l-arginine decarboxylase pathway probably has its only function in polyamine biosynthesis and does not represent a major pathway for l-arginine degradation in synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> when cells grew with l-arginine as sole n-source.

as shown in fig.  <dig>  the transcript levels for the l-arginine deiminase  as well as for the l-arginine oxidase/dehydrogenase  were substantially higher than for the three l-arginine decarboxylase isoenzymes. the steady-state transcript levels for these two enzymes were as high in nitrate-grown cells as in l-arginine-grown cells. this suggests that these two genes are transcribed constitutively. the same is true for the transcripts of the subsequent enzymes of the two pathways with the exception of the carbamate kinase transcript . the mrna for the carbamate kinase was lower than for the other enzymes and the steady-state transcript level was found to be highly increased in l-arginine-grown cells.

CONCLUSIONS
the bioinformatic evaluation of  <dig> cyanobacterial genomes suggests the presence of an l-arginine decarboxylase-, an arginase-, an l-arginine amidinotransferase-, an l-arginine deiminase-, and an l-arginine oxidase/dehydrogenase pathway in the investigated cyanobacteria . all investigated strains contain an l-arginine decarboxylase pathway, which most likely mainly facilitates polyamine biosynthesis. since extracellularly added putrescine has been shown to be toxic, at least for some cyanobacteria  <cit> , it is unlikely that this pathway is a major pathway for l-arginine degradation. in addition to the l-arginine decarboxylase pathway, one or two further l-arginine-degrading pathway is  present, which is either an arginase pathway, an l-arginine deiminase pathway or an l-arginine oxidase/dehydrogenase pathway. although an l-arginine amidinotransferase pathway can not be excluded entirely, this pathway is rather unlikely to have a major function in l-arginine degradation, since l-arginine amidinotransferases seem to mainly function in antibiotic and toxin production in prokaryotes  <cit> .

an interesting result of the bioinformatic analysis is the observation that the cyanobacterial l-arginine deiminases, being present in nine cyanobacterial strains , are substantially larger than the corresponding enzymes from non-photosynthetic eubacteria . further, they seem to be bound either to the cytoplasmic or the thylakoid membrane. in bacteria it has been shown that the l-arginine deiminase pathway is regulated in a rather complex way in dependence of the l-arginine and oxygen concentration, the redox poise, and/or energy status of the cell  <cit> . on the basis of the larger size and the predicted membrane association of the cyanobacterial l-arginine deiminases, the regulation of the l-arginine deiminase pathway in cyanobacteria maybe even more complex than in bacteria. this has also to be seen under the aspect that this pathway leads to atp synthesis in the last enzymatic step providing an additional substrate-level phosphorylation site.

the second rather unexpected observation is the presence of a putative l-arginine oxidase/dehydrogenase pathway in ten cyanobacteria . the first enzyme of this pathway has similarity to an l-amino acid oxidase, catalyzing the oxidative deamination of basic l-amino acids with a preference for l-arginine and with oxygen as electron acceptor in synechococcus elongatus pcc  <dig> and pcc  <dig>  this pathway has not yet been investigated in detail. however, preliminary results, which had been obtained with synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig>  suggest that the first enzyme of this pathway does not represent an l-arginine oxidase with oxygen as electron acceptor, but rather represents an l-arginine dehydrogenase, which interacts in a complex not yet understood with the electron transport chain. an interaction of amino acid dehydrogenases with the respiratory electron transport chain has previously been shown for e. coli  <cit> .

in addition to the overview on l-arginine-degrading pathways in  <dig> cyanobacteria, we have performed a more detailed evaluation of the pathways in synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig>  this investigation provided evidence that synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> has three putative l-arginine-degrading pathways, being an l-arginine decarboxylase pathway, an l-arginine deiminase pathway, and an l-arginine oxidase/dehydrogenase pathway. an arginase pathway does not seem to exist, since the two proteins, originally annotated as arginases, do not possess an arginase activity  <cit> . transcript analyses revealed that the mrna levels for the three isoenzymes of l-arginine decarboxylase  and also for the agmatinase sll <dig> were rather low in synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> in nitrate- or l-arginine-grown cells. thus, this pathway probably has its major function in polyamine biosynthesis. in contrast, the transcript levels for a putative l-arginine deiminase pathway  and an l-arginine oxidase/dehydrogenase pathway  were high whether l-arginine or nitrate was the n-source, suggesting that these two pathways are the major l-arginine-degrading pathways and that they are expressed constitutively. the only exception is the carbamate kinase, whose transcript was found at elevated levels in l-arginine-grown cells. the lack of a substantial up-regulation of these transcripts, when cells were transferred from a nitrate-containing medium to an l-arginine-containing medium and an illumination of  <dig> μmol photons m- <dig> s- <dig> light, suggests that these pathways, besides having a function in the utilization of extracellular l-arginine, have a role in the complex dynamic metabolism of cyanophycin, which is not yet fully understood  <cit> . such a functional l-arginine deiminase pathway would account for the products of l-arginine degradation identified in synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig>  <cit> . the bioinformatic evaluation in combination with the transcript analysis suggests that synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> has an unusual l-arginine deiminase and an unusual l-arginine oxidase/dehydrogenase as the major l-arginine-degrading enzymes. an extended biochemical investigation of these two enzymes and the corresponding pathways is required before a statement can be made on how these two pathways are integrated in the overall c- and n-metabolism in synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig>
