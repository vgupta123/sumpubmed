BACKGROUND
variants in single bases of dna sequences yield single nucleotide polymorphisms , among which non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms  occurring in protein coding regions lead to amino acid substitutions in protein products, potentially affect protein functions, and are closely related to human inherited diseases. hence, predicting potential effects of non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms and their resulting amino acid substitutions on protein functions is of central importance in modern pathological and pharmaceutical studies  <cit> . recently, increasing amounts of amino acid substitutions occurring in human proteins have been detected and collected in various databases such as the swiss-prot database  <cit> , the human gene mutation database   <cit> , and the online mendelian inheritance in man+  database  <cit> . stand alone data sets such as the unbiased laboratory mutagenesis data derived from experiments on the e. coli lac repressor  <cit>  and the bacteriophage t <dig> lysozyme  <cit>  are also available. with these data sources, the prediction is typically based on a set of features derived from the sequence and structural properties, as well as the phylogenetic information of the proteins containing the substitutions. for instance, chasman and adams derived sequence and structure-based features from a structural model and the phylogenetic information  <cit> . sunyaev et al. analyzed amino acid substitutions on the basis of protein three-dimensional structure and multiple alignments of homologous sequences  <cit> . ferrer-costa et al. characterized disease-associated substitutions in terms of substitution matrix, secondary structure, accessibility, free energies of transfer from water to octanol, etc.  <cit> . saunders and baker created mutation models by means of a variety of structural and evolutionary features  <cit> . krishnan and westhead used the physicochemical classes of residues, sequence conservation score, secondary structure, solvent accessibility, and buried charge, etc.  <cit> . ng and henikoff utilized the sequence conservation and the blosum amino acid substitution matrices  <cit> . with a set of features ready, the prediction is conventionally performed by making use of either the standard machine learning methods such as the decision tree  <cit> , the support vector machines  <cit> , the random forest  <cit> , the statistical and classification models  <cit> , or certain specifically designed methods such as the sift   <cit> .

no matter what kind of method is used, the quality of the features plays an important role in predicting the potential effects of given amino acid substitutions. to construct these features, amino acid substitutions were mapped to protein 3d structures  <cit> ; evolutionary properties were measured from statistical models  <cit> ; secondary structure and accessibility were computed from various prediction programs  <cit> ; database annotations were also included  <cit> . however, the availability of protein or homologous proteins' structures limits the scope of the applications of these methods. in addition, most of these prediction methods are complicated and the prediction results are difficult to interpret, because a large number of complicated features are used and many of them rely heavily on other computational models. although in some methods simple features were used with some specifically designed statistical models  <cit> , the prediction accuracy is not as high as those methods using combined multiple features  <cit> .

a good feature set should contain as few features as possible, while each feature should have clear physicochemical meaning and is easy to be interpreted in biological terms. to achieve these objectives, we derived a novel feature set  based on three physicochemical properties  of amino acids, three relative frequencies of occurrences of amino acids in the secondary structures  of proteins with known secondary structural information, and the evolutionary profile of the protein containing the substitution. we compared the quality of the proposed feature set with other more complicated ones by applying the decision tree  <cit> , the support vector machine  <cit> , and the random forest  <cit>  to the experimental amino acid substitution data of the e. coli lac repressor  <cit>  and the bacteriophage t <dig> lysozyme  <cit> , as well as to a wide range of human amino acid substitutions collected in the swiss-prot database. the results showed that our simple yet interpretable feature set was superior to other published ones  <cit>  in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic  curve , the balanced error rate , and the matthews' correlation coefficient .

although existing machine learning methods could make predictions, they acted like "black boxes" in that they were not capable of capturing physicochemical principles behind the predictions. in many circumstances, however, these hidden principles were of more importance since they could reveal how amino acid substitutions affected protein functions and why some amino acid substitutions would result in diseases. in order to explore these principles and associate amino acid substitutions with biological knowledge, we would use rule induction methods to automatically search rules for amino acid substitutions. these rules should be  interpretable, consisting of a small set of simple features;  high-quality, with very few exceptions; and  general, capable of explaining a significant number of substitutions.

in this paper, we considered rules as sub-regions  in the feature space composed of amino acid substitutions. more specifically, the boxes were defined in terms of the feature intervals. a previous method for finding boxes in the feature space was the patient rule induction method   <cit> , which searched for optimal boxes using a steepest-ascent approach and was intuitively referred to as a "bump hunting" method. when applied to our problem, the prim had drawbacks in that the imbalance between the numbers of data samples in different categories was not considered, and some redundant features in the boxes should be manually removed and the quality of the resulting boxes significantly decreased. to overcome these shortcomings, we incorporated a new criterion called the discrimination power to take the imbalance between the numbers of data samples in different categories into consideration, and developed a novel simulated annealing bump hunting strategy which made use of the simulated annealing method to automatically discard redundant features while extracting high quality rules. we validated this strategy using heterogenous experimental amino acid substitutions occurring in both the e. coli lac repressor  <cit>  and the bacteriophage t <dig> lysozyme  <cit> , and showed that our approach could extract rules with comparable converge and accuracy but much better interpretability as those extracted by the original prim method. we then applied our strategy to annotated human amino acid substitutions collected in the swiss-prot database and successfully identified several rules which could be interpreted using physicochemical terms and were consistent with the current biological knowledge. we further applied the induced intolerant rules to unclassified human amino acid substitution data, and the results showed that these rules could cover a large portion of data samples and most of the covered samples showed good agreement with predictions made by either the support vector machine or the random forest. beyond the highly confident predictions, these rules more importantly revealed the physicochemical principles behind the covered amino acid substitutions and explained why these substitutions would result in diseases.

RESULTS
data sources
a large number of amino acid substitutions occurring in human proteins have been collected in the swiss-prot protein database  <cit> . in version  <dig>  , the swiss-prot database contained  <dig>  amino acid substitution entries in  <dig>  human proteins, with each substitution being annotated as "disease", "polymorphism", or "unclassified". for a clear and concise presentation, we would refer to amino acid substitutions with the annotation "disease" as intolerant ones and those with the annotation "polymorphism" as tolerant ones. in this paper, we studied human proteins having at least  <dig> homologous proteins in the pfam database  <cit>  , and focused on the substitutions occurring in known protein domains. in total, we collected  <dig>   <dig> intolerant substitutions,  <dig>   <dig> tolerant substitutions, and  <dig>  unclassified ones in  <dig>   <dig> human proteins.

in order to validate the proposed feature set and the simulated annealing bump hunting strategy, two sets of experimental amino acid substitution data for the e. coli lac repressor  <cit>  and the bacteriophage t <dig> lysozyme  <cit>  were used. in these data sets, the effects of amino acid substitutions on the function of the corresponding protein were rated and classified to four categories. in the case of the lac repressor, the four categories were "+" , "+-" , "-+" , and "-" . in the case of the t <dig> lysozyme, the four categories were "++" , "+" , "+/-" , and "-" . following the definition used by chasman and adams  <cit> , as well as by krishnan and westhead  <cit> , substitutions falling into the "no effect" category were treated as tolerant ones, and substitutions in the other categories were regarded as intolerant ones. in total, for the e. coli lac repressor, we collected  <dig>  intolerant substitutions and  <dig>  tolerant ones. for the t <dig> lysozyme, we collected  <dig> intolerant substitutions and  <dig>  tolerant ones.

prediction of the experimental amino acid substitutions
we first show that the proposed feature set can outperform other published feature sets in the prediction of potential effects of experimental amino acid substitutions occurring in the e. coli lac repressor  <cit>  and the t <dig> lysozyme  <cit> . we performed 10-fold cross-validation experiments using both the support vector machine and the random forest with the proposed feature set on the substitution samples, calculated the area under the roc curve , the minimum balanced error rate , and the maximum matthews' correlation coefficient , and compared them with other published results. detailed descriptions regarding the prediction methods and the definition of the criteria are presented in the method section.

the cross-validation results using our feature set  are shown in table  <dig>  first, we can see from the table that for the experimental substitutions occurring in homogenous proteins, our feature set works well with both the support vector machine and the random forest. when working with the random forest, the discrete form of our feature set can produce an auc of  <dig> , a ber of  <dig> , and a mcc of  <dig>  for the experimental substitutions occurring in the e. coli lac repressor, suggesting that about 88% of the substitutions can be predicted accurately. when working with the support vector machine, the results are slightly worse, but the continuous form of our feature set can still predict about 85% substitutions accurately. for experimental substitutions occurring in the t <dig> lysozyme, we obtain similar results. second, the results show that our feature set can also work well for experimental substitutions occurring in heterogenous proteins. when applied to the mixed samples occurring in both the e. coli lac repressor and the t <dig> lysozyme, the random forest with the discrete form of our feature set can produce an auc of  <dig> , a ber of  <dig> , and a mcc of  <dig> , suggesting that about 85% of the substitutions can be predicted accurately. thirdly, we notice that in our studies, the random forest works slightly better than the support vector machine with our feature set in terms of the auc, the ber, and the mcc.

we compared the cross-validation results using our feature set with those obtained by the sift  and another published feature set . as a sequence homology-based method, the sift can achieve bers of 33% and 34% for experimental amino acid substitutions occurring in the e. coli lac repressor and the t <dig> lysozyme, respectively. by comparison, the continuous form of our feature set can achieve corresponding bers of 14% and 17% when working with the random forest , respectively. these results suggest that our feature set can outperform the sift in the prediction of potential effects of experimental amino acid substitutions occurring in homogenous proteins. the published feature set by krishnan and westhead  <cit>  uses  <dig> features, including  <dig> sequence based ones , sequence conservation score at the mutated position, molecular mass shift on mutation, and hydrophobicity difference), and  <dig> structure based ones . when working with the support vector machine, this feature set can achieve bers of 27%, 29%, and 28% for experimental amino acid substitutions occurring in the e. coli lac repressor, the t <dig> lysozyme, and the mixture of them, respectively, while the continuous form of our feature set can achieve corresponding bers of 15%, 18%, and 19%, respectively. when working with the decision tree, the published feature set can achieve bers of 16%, 20%, and 21% for experimental amino acid substitutions occurring in the e. coli lac repressor, the t <dig> lysozyme, and the mixture of them, respectively, while the continuous form of our feature set can achieve corresponding bers of 16%, 18%, and 19%, respectively. these results suggest that our feature set can work as good as or outperform the published feature set  <cit>  in the prediction of potential effects of experimental amino acid substitutions occurring in both homogenous and heterogenous proteins.

prediction of the disease related amino acid substitutions
we performed 10-fold cross-validation experiments using both the support vector machine and the random forest with the proposed feature set on amino acid substitutions occurring in highly heterogenous human proteins and collected in the swiss-prot database, and compared the results with other published results .

the published method  <cit>  used a complicated feature set. for every substitution pair, they directly used two three-dimensional structural information predicted by the environment program  <cit> , one secondary structural information predicted by the stride program  <cit> , and one statistical score calculated by the sift program  <cit> . their feature set also included another feature derived from the prediction results of these programs, and the wild-type amino acid identity. altogether, they used six features. five of them were three-dimensional structural or statistical ones, and needed to be calculated using other programs. due to the limited availability of three-dimensional structural information, only a small fraction of available substitutions  in the swiss-prot database could be considered in their method. in contrast, our proposed feature set used only sequence information and evolutionary profiles, and did not depend on any other prediction programs. consequently, we could predict more substitutions  in a wider range of  human proteins.

for comprehensive measures, figure  <dig> shows the roc curves for the support vector machine  and the random forest  using the proposed continuous form of our feature set. when compared with the sift and the method used by bao and cui , we can see clearly that both methods using our feature set produce better roc curves , indicating that the proposed feature set is superior to both the sift and the feature set presented in  <cit>  in terms of comprehensive prediction power . for the discrete form, the auc is  <dig>  for the support vector machine and  <dig>  for the random forest, and the roc curves  are similar to those using the continuous form.

more specifically, we compared the two criteria for a certain single decision threshold, as shown in table  <dig>  when working with the support vector machine, the continuous form of our feature set leads the sift  by about 4%  in ber and about  <dig>   in mcc. when working with the random forest, the continuous form of our feature set leads the sift by about 5%  in ber and about  <dig>   in mcc. similar results are obtained when comparing the discrete form of our feature set with the sift. these results suggest that our feature set can outperform the sift in the prediction of amino acid substitutions occurring in human proteins. when comparing our results with those obtained using the feature set proposed in  <cit> , we can see from the table that for both prediction methods using the proposed feature set, the bers are much smaller while the mccs are much larger than the corresponding method using the feature set presented in  <cit> , indicating that our feature set are much better than the published one.

correlation and relative importance of the proposed features
for better understanding of the relationship between the proposed features, we calculated the pairwise pearson's correlation coefficients between the proposed features  based on the amino acid substitutions occurring in human proteins and presented the  correlation matrix in figure  <dig>  we divided the features to  <dig> groups according to their definitions in the method section, and named these groups at the top of the matrix. first, we can see from the matrix that the two evolutionary conservation scores  have very weak correlations with other  <dig> features. second, for the original amino acid group , the window-sized group , and the column-weighted group , features derived from the same  properties  show medium positive correlations, as illustrated in region  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in the matrix. third, the relative change features  show strong positive correlations with the substitution features derived from the same properties  and strong negative correlations with the original, the window-sized, or the column-weighted features , as illustrated in region  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. finally, as shown in region  <dig> in the matrix, the relative change features derived from the same properties show strong positive correlations . we also calculated the correlation matrix for the discrete form of the proposed features based on the amino acid substitutions occurring in human proteins and observed similar results . these observations, though can be intuitively explained from the definitions and calculation schemes of the features , provide us informative understanding and quantitative measurement of the relationship between the proposed features and can be used as evidences in the future feature selection procedure.

we then evaluated the relative importance of the proposed features using the scheme included in the random forest and presented the results in figure  <dig>  in the random forest, the raw importance of a feature is calculated by randomly permuting the values of the feature in the out-of-bag  cases, calculating the difference of classification errors between the original and the permuted cases, and averaging this difference over all the trees in the forest  <cit> . to make the measurement of importance more understandable, a normalization procedure is further applied to the raw importance of each feature by dividing the raw importance with the maximum raw importance over all the features . consequently, the relative importance of every proposed feature  is obtained. for the continuous form of the proposed features , we can see that the two evolutionary conservation scores  are of the most importance. the column-weighted group  and the substitution-column group  have similar importance and follow the evolutionary score group. for other groups of features, the order of importance is the substitution-original group  > the original group  > the substitution-window group  > the substitution group  > the window-sized group . for individual features, the first  <dig> most important features are ordered as x <dig> > x <dig> > x <dig> > x <dig> > x <dig> > x <dig> > x <dig> > x <dig> > x <dig> > x <dig>  on the one hand, all of the  <dig> features except for x <dig> in this order are calculated with the evolutionary conservation scores , revealing the significant importance of the evolutionary information in the prediction of potential effects of amino acid substitutions. on the other hand, the frequent appearances of the features derived from the molecular weight , the hydrophobicity scale , and the relative frequency in turns  in this order suggest the importance of these properties in the identification of human disease related amino acid substitutions. for the discrete form of the proposed features , the results show that the relative importance of the window-sized, the column-weighted, and the relative change features are not as good as their continuous forms, suggesting that the discretization procedure causes information loss for individual features. when looking at the order of the top  <dig> most informative features , we confirm the importance of the evolutionary information , the molecular weight , the hydrophobicity scale , and the relative frequency in turns .

validation of the simulated annealing bump hunting strategy
a merit property of the discrete form of our feature set is that every feature has strong physico-chemical meaning, which enables us to induce interpretable rules to explain the biological principles behind amino acid substitutions. we first validated the proposed simulated annealing bump hunting strategy using the heterogenous experimental amino acid substitution data. we randomly divided the mixed substitution samples occurring in the e. coli lac repressor and the t <dig> lysozyme into a training set  and a test set , applied the simulated annealing bump hunting strategy to the training set, and evaluated the resulting rules on the test set. as an example, table  <dig> lists ten rules  extracted by the simulated annealing bump hunting strategy. from the table, we can see that the extracted rules have comparable coverage , accuracy , and discrimination power for the training and test set, suggesting that our strategy is capable of extracting general rules. for example, for intolerant rules, the simulated annealing bump hunting strategy extracted a 1-feature rule with a coverage of  <dig>  and an accuracy of  <dig>  from the training set, while the same rule have a coverage of  <dig>  and an accuracy of  <dig>  when evaluated using the test set.

we also made a comparison between the simulated annealing bump hunting strategy and the original patient rule induction method , which was implemented in the supergem software  <cit> . some candidate rules  are shown in figure  <dig>  from the figure, we can see that the rules extracted by the simulated annealing bump hunting strategy have comparable coverage and accuracy but much better interpretability  as the rules extracted by the original prim method. for example, for intolerant rules , the simulated annealing bump hunting strategy extracted a 5-feature rule with a coverage of  <dig>  and an accuracy of  <dig> , while the original prim method extracted a  <dig> feature rule with comparable coverage and accuracy. similarly, for tolerant rules , the simulated annealing bump hunting strategy extracted a 4-feature rule with a coverage of  <dig>  and an accuracy of  <dig> , while the original prim method extracted a  <dig> feature rule with comparable coverage and accuracy.

amino acid substitution rules
we applied the simulated annealing bump hunting strategy with the discrete form of our feature set to the human amino acid substitution data and extracted several rules which were consistent with current biological knowledge. as examples, figure  <dig> presents a group of three intolerant rules which uses conservation scores and provides us general understanding regarding the intolerant substitutions. detailed descriptions regarding the notations and definitions of the features are presented in the method section.

rule  <dig> in figure  <dig> says that for a substitution pair, if the substituted amino acid never appears in the column  of the pfam multiple sequence alignment, the substitution is very likely to be intolerant. this rule uses a single feature  and covers 29%  data samples with an accuracy of 88% and a discrimination power of  <dig> .

rule  <dig> in figure  <dig> says that for a substitution pair, if the substituted amino acid rarely  appears in the corresponding column of the pfam multiple sequence alignment, the substitution is very likely to be intolerant. this rule uses a single feature , covering  <dig> %  data samples with an accuracy of 92% and a discrimination power of  <dig> .

rule  <dig> in figure  <dig> says that for a substitution pair, if the original amino acid very abundantly  appears in the corresponding column of the pfam multiple sequence alignment, the substitution is very likely to be intolerant. this rule uses a single feature , covering 14%  data samples with an accuracy of 95% and a discrimination power of  <dig> .

these rules can be understood as follows. in the pfam multiple sequence alignments, homologous proteins are aligned according to their functional units . hence, amino acids appearing in a certain column of an alignment would be those that are crucial in maintaining the protein function. on the contrary, amino acids rarely appearing in a certain column of an alignment would very likely be irrelevant to the protein function. therefore, in rule  <dig> and rule  <dig>  when an amino acid is substituted by another amino acid which never or rarely appears in the multiple sequence alignment, the function of the protein could hardly be maintained. in rule  <dig>  the very abundant appearance of the original amino acid in the multiple sequence alignment indicates that the amino acid is crucial in keeping the protein function. therefore, when the amino acid is substituted, the protein would very likely be malfunction.

the second group of three rules uses physicochemical features and provides us specific understanding regarding the intolerant substitutions for individual amino acids, as illustrated in figure  <dig> 

rule  <dig> in figure  <dig> says that if a cysteine is substituted, no matter what kind of amino acids it is substituted to, the substitution is very likely to be intolerant. this rule uses a single feature , covering  <dig> %  data samples with an accuracy of 91% and a discrimination power of  <dig> . the cysteine is the only amino acid capable of forming disulfide bonds, and the disulfide bridges between cysteines within a polypeptide support the protein's secondary structure. therefore, when a cysteines is substituted, the structure would be destroyed, and the protein would lose its function.

rule  <dig> in figure  <dig> says that when a glycine is substituted, if the evolutionary profile medium or highly prefers turns , the substitution is very likely to be intolerant. this rule uses  <dig> features , covering  <dig> %  data samples with an accuracy of 95% and a discrimination power of  <dig> . this rule can be understood from two aspects. first, the glycine is the smallest amino acid. therefore, when a glycine is substituted by any other  amino acids, there might not be enough space to hold that amino acid, and thus the secondary structure of the polypeptide would be destroyed. as a result, the protein would lose its function. second, the glycine is one of the amino acids most prefer turns . hence, when the turn structure is important to the protein function  and a glycine is substituted, the function of the protein would very likely change.

rule  <dig> in figure  <dig> says that when an amino acid is substituted by an arginine, if the evolutionary profile is acidic , and the substituted amino acid  has a medium to strongly negative change in hydrophobicity versus the evolutionary profile , the substitution is very likely to be intolerant. this rule uses  <dig> features , covering  <dig> %  data samples with an accuracy of 93% and a discrimination power of  <dig> . this rule can be understood from the following aspects. first, the arginine is the most alkalic  and most hydrophilic amino acid. second, an acidic evolutionary profile indicates that amino acids with small pi values are crucial to the protein's function. thirdly, the substituted amino acid  having medium to strongly negative change in hydrophobicity scale suggests that hydrophilic amino acids are the majority in the homologous proteins . therefore, when an arginine replaces the original amino acid, the above second and third conditions are violated, and thus the function of the protein would be destroyed.

the third group of three rules uses both the conservation scores and the physicochemical features, and provides us specific understanding regarding the tolerant substitutions, as illustrated in figure  <dig> 

rule  <dig> in figure  <dig> says that if the substituted amino acid appears in the multiple sequence alignment with a rather high frequency , the substitution is very likely to be tolerant. this rule uses a single feature , covering  <dig> %  data samples with an accuracy of 81% and a discrimination power of  <dig> . this rule can be thought of as the opposite of the previous rule  <dig> and rule  <dig>  amino acids appearing in a certain column of a pfam multiple sequence alignment would be those that are crucial in maintaining the protein function. therefore, when an amino acid is substituted by another amino acid which appears in the multiple sequence alignment with a rather high frequency, the function of the protein could possibly be maintained, and the substitution is likely to be tolerant.

rule  <dig> in figure  <dig> says that if the original amino acid appears in a hydrophilic local environment  and the substituted amino acid appears in the multiple sequence alignment with a relatively high frequency , the substitution is very likely to be tolerant. this rule uses  <dig> features , covering  <dig> %  data samples with an accuracy of 74% and a discrimination power of  <dig> . the understanding of this rule is similar to the previous rule  <dig>  amino acids appearing in a certain column of a pfam multiple sequence alignment would be those that relate to the maintenance of the protein function. hence, when an amino acid is substituted by another amino acid which appears in the multiple sequence alignment with a relatively high frequency, the function of the protein could possibly be maintained, and the substitution is likely to be tolerant.

rule  <dig> in figure  <dig> says that when one of the amino acids in the set of {w, v, g, l, i} is substituted by one of the amino acids the set of {v, i} , if the substituted amino acid has a neutral change in molecular weight against the original one , the substitution is likely to be tolerant. this rule uses  <dig> features , covering  <dig> %  data samples with an accuracy of 77% and a discrimination power of  <dig> . the principle behind this rule is that when amino acids are substituted by other amino acids having similar physicochemical properties, the structure of the protein is likely to be maintained, and thus the function of the protein is likely to be kept.

prediction of the unclassified amino acid substitutions
we further applied the support vector machine and the random forest with the discrete form of our feature set to predict potential effects of unclassified amino acid substitutions in human proteins. we first used the 10-fold cross-validation experiments to determine the decision threshold for each method so that the balanced error rate  could be minimized in the experiments, and then applied each method with the corresponding decision threshold on the unclassified data to make predictions. the results are shown in figure  <dig> 

within the  <dig>  unclassified amino acid substitutions, the support vector machine predicted  <dig>  as intolerant and  <dig>  as tolerant, while the random forest predicted  <dig>  as intolerant and  <dig>  as tolerant.  <dig>  substitutions were predicted as intolerant and  <dig>  were predicted as tolerant by both methods. these overlapping predictions were therefore with high confidence.

we also applied the six intolerant rules induced by the simulated annealing bump hunting strategy in the previous section to the unclassified data. in total, the six intolerant rules covered  <dig>  data samples, and  <dig> out of them were also predicted as intolerant by both the support vector machine and the random forest. besides,  <dig> samples covered by these rules were also predicted as intolerant by one of the prediction methods. only  <dig> samples were not predicted as intolerant by either method. these statistics suggested that the induced interpretable rules were general , and were of very high quality . more importantly, beyond the highly confident predictions, these rules also revealed the physicochemical principles behind the covered amino acid substitutions and explained why these substitutions would be intolerant.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
most contemporary studies aiming at predicting potential effects of amino acid substitutions made use of complicated and not widely available properties of amino acids and proteins. to overcome these limitations, we proposed a feature set based on three physicochemical properties of amino acids, three relative frequencies of amino acids in the secondary structures of proteins with known secondary structure information, and two evolutionary conservation scores. we applied three machine learning methods  with our feature set to experimental amino acid substitutions occurring in the e. coli lac repressor and the bacteriophage t <dig> lysozyme, and showed that the methods using our feature set could achieve preferred prediction results in terms of the area under the roc curve, the balanced error rate, and the matthews' correlation coefficient. we further applied the support vector machine and the random forest with our feature set to a large number of amino acid substitutions occurring in highly heterogenous human proteins, and showed that our feature set could be applied to a much wider range of human proteins and the prediction methods using our feature set were superior to those using the existing more complicated feature sets.

although existing methods could produce reasonable predictions, they were not capable of capturing physicochemical principles behind the predictions. in many situations, however, these hidden principles were of more importance because they could uncover how amino acid substitutions affect protein functions and why some substitutions would result in diseases. in order to explore these principles, we used a novel designed rule induction method called the simulated annealing bump hunting strategy to automatically extract interpretable rules for amino acid substitutions. the induced rules were either consistent with current biological knowledge or providing new insights for the understanding of the physicochemical principles behind amino acid substitutions.

one limitation of our feature set is that we currently use the pfam multiple sequence alignment to extract evolutionary information for the query protein sequence. as a result, we are limited to deal with amino acid substitutions occurring in known protein domains. this limitation can be overcome by using some other multiple sequence alignment method such as the psi-blast and clustalw instead of the pfam. another limitation of our feature set is that the number of features is large, and some of them are highly correlated. although good results have been achieved, integrating feature selection mechanisms in prediction methods could further improve the prediction performance. this demand is especially urgent when using the support vector machine as the prediction method. a third limitation is regarding how to perform fair and comprehensive comparisons between feature sets and prediction methods proposed in different literatures, especially when the training and test samples are of different sizes and from different data sources. although this direction is not the focus in this paper, it would be of great importance and necessity in developing a general benchmark system using unified statistical criteria in our future work.

as for the simulated annealing bump hunting strategy, there exist two free parameters . although free parameters incorporate more flexibility into the method, they make the computational burden heavier . how to design an automated mechanism to guide the determination of these free parameters remains an ongoing study. also, although the nine presented rules could be well explained, there exist some other rules which are not easy to be interpreted by current biological knowledge, especially when the rules contain many features. how to simplify our feature set to make the rules more interpretable forms another research focus.

despite the limitations, we showed that our results were reasonably good. when using our feature set with the support vector machine and the random forest, we obtained better roc curves and smaller  prediction error rates in the cross-validation experiments. when applied to unclassified data, the six induced intolerant rules could cover a large portion of data samples, and most of the covered substitutions were also predicted as intolerant by either the support vector machine or the random forest. more importantly, beyond the highly confident predictions, these rules could also reveal the physicochemical principles behind the covered samples and explain why these substitutions would cause diseases.
