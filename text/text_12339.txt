BACKGROUND
expression microarrays are powerful tools for disease diagnosis, prognosis and treatment  <cit> , offering unparalleled insight into the function of the entire genome and the dynamic interactions among genes. two common platforms are oligonucleotide and cdna microarrays. oligonucleotide microarrays are generated by either robotic deposition of pre-synthesized oligos or in situ synthesis of ~25-mer oligo probes ontosolid slides  <cit> , while cdna microarrays are created by spotting long strands of amplified cdna sequences, such as expressed sequence tags   <cit> .

specific hybridization is the desired type of hybridization between a probe and the target sequence that comes from the same transcript. by contrast, cross-hybridization may occur between parts of the probe and target sequences that do not come from the same transcript as the probe. cross-hybridization can be a significant contributor to false-positive noise in array data and is known to happen in both oligo and cdna microarray platforms. duplex stabilities and re-association kinetics for nucleic acid hybridization is complex, and many factors are involved. experimental conditions such as hybridization temperature, salt concentration, viscosity of the solvents, ph value are important. concentration, complexity, lengths, and gc contents, as well as the secondary structures of nucleic acids are also critical. a comprehensive review can be found in  <cit> .

hybridization in solvents is different from that on solid surfaces, and different surfaces and platforms have different properties. several studies have been conducted to model the expression intensities using binding kinetics based on physical properties or oligo composition in the popular oligonucleotide microarrays made by affymetrix  <cit> . cross-hybridization is an especially severe problem for cdna microarrays because of the lengths of the probes  <cit> . because predictions of binding free energy cannot yet be achieved for longer sequences, the models developed for oligo arrays cannot be generalized to cdna microarrays. several univariate studies have attempted to correlate the hybridization intensities and sequence characteristics between the probe-target pair for cdna or dna microarrays using genomic sequences  <cit> . most of these studies  <cit>  reached the same  conclusion that sequences sharing a high degree of identity have a higher chance to cross-hybridize. another approach to studying cross-hybridization is to investigate the relationships between contiguous pairing segments and hybridization intensity  <cit> . all these studies acknowledged some exceptions that could not be accommodated by their univariate analyses. to the authors' knowledge, no systematic multivariate predictive modeling has been attempted for cdna microarray hybridizations.

a field relevant to the microarray cross-hybridization issue is the design of short interfering rna  sequences  leading to rna interference . in particular, the selection of effective sirna sequences that minimize off-target silencing effects is a topic of great interest in computational and functional genomics  <cit> . as in the field of cdna array analysis, these reports point to the fact that more studies focus on the hybridization between short sequences  rather than on cross-hybridization between long sequences.

specific signal quantification is crucial for correct interpretation of microarray experiments, and probe selection has been the major task for array design in the past decade  <cit>  to avoid cross-hybridization. however, the number of probes spotted on both oligo and cdna arrays increases dramatically as the technology advances, and cross-hybridization almost becomes inevitable. a computational method validated by proper experiments to quantify platform-specific cross-hybridization is needed to derive correct quantification of sequence-specific signals. the challenge is that cross-hybridization is the result of complex interactions between multiple target and probe sequences on the arrays . it seems very difficult to attack this problem in generality at this point. therefore, as a first step toward understanding this complex phenomenon of a many-to-many relationship, we propose to investigate a simplified system with hybridization between one target and multiple probes spotted on the arrays; that is, to quantify the hybridization of one target to many probes .

a dataset of cyp <dig> pcr products spotted on microarrays following the experimental design proposed in  <cit>  was used for our model development. the genes in the cytochrome p <dig> family are known to have varying degrees of sequence similarities, thus making them good candidates for studying cross-hybridization phenomena on microarrays  <cit> . because hybridization is influenced by sequence characteristics as well as many experimental factors, the experimental/hybridization conditions, such as target/probe concentration, salt concentration, and hybridization temperature, were kept consistent throughout this study.

the immediate goal of our current research is to identify efficacious sets of sequence features for predicting hybridization between probe-target pairs in a multivariate fashion and to determine how different factors synergistically influence hybridization. our ultimate goal, which reaches beyond the scope of this paper, is to estimate specific hybridization features after correcting for false-positive cross-hybridization.

RESULTS
a dataset of cyp <dig> pcr products spotted on microarrays  <cit>  was used to validate the proposed multivariate approach. thirty-one different cdnas from the cyp <dig> family  were hybridized individually with each of  <dig> arrays. triplicates were generated, for a total of  <dig> arrays. the target/probe concentrations and other experimental conditions  were constant across arrays. details of the experiments and array manufacturing processes are described in methods and  <cit> .

twelve potential predictors were included in the model . the pairwise correlations between all pairs of variables and hybridization intensities  were summarized in result  <dig>  in additional file  <dig> . as expected, some of the variables were correlated. the probe-target pairs with more most-contiguous-base-pairs  and long overlaps  often had higher intensities  than others .

multivariate models
three multivariate methods, multiple linear regression , regression tree  analysis, and feed-forward artificial neural network  analysis were performed to predict hybridization . the results from these analyses were compared with that of the third-order polynomial regression, using percent identity  as the sole predictor, as proposed by xu and collaborators  <cit>  . five-fold cross-validation  was performed to estimate the generalized errors  <cit>  for all types of models so that the estimated errors were directly comparable. models with all possible combinations of  <dig> potential predictors  were fitted and evaluated in each cv fold, and the model with the minimum sum of square errors was selected when p variables were included in the model . in the case of a closed-form solution for the model identification procedure , one-step cv was performed. otherwise, two-step cv was performed: first-step cv to make decisions on the most appropriate internal model complexity and second-step cv to estimate the generalized errors of the final model .

third-order polynomial regression 
the third-order polynomial model using percent identity  as the single predictor  <cit>  was significant . the polynomial terms were statistically significant, and the point estimates were β^0

multiple linear regression 
a total of  <dig>   multiple linear regression models  were computed, and the model with the minimum sum of square errors at a given subset size p was selected . the cv errors of all subset sizes were estimated . the multiple linear regression with minimum cv errors  contained two variables . the most parsimonious model within one standard error of the minimum cv errors, the model with p =  <dig>  was chosen  <cit> . its only variable was the most contiguous base pairs  . the regression coefficients were estimated using the full dataset after the model subset size was decided. the regression model was significant . the transformed hybridization increased  <dig>  units as the most contiguous base pair increased by one unit. the residuals were examined, and no obvious pattern was detected to suggest model violation.

regression tree 
a total of  <dig>  large trees was grown for each of the five cv training sets . each large tree was then pruned. the first-step cv was performed to compute the cost for each subtree. the smallest tree within one standard error of the minimum-cost subtree was selected  <cit> . the model with the minimum sum of square errors at a given subset size p was selected . the generalized errors were estimated in the second-step cv . the model with minimum cv errors was the model of subset size  <dig>  and it was also the most parsimonious model within one standard error . the models of subset size  <dig> were not all the same across the five cv training sets , and the majority  contained x <dig>  and x <dig> . we therefore fitted the model using the entire dataset with x <dig> and x <dig> to derive the optimal regression tree. this subtree partitioned the feature space into five decision regions . node  <dig> at the root is the most contiguous base pairs , which can separate strong hybridizations from others. when there are more than  <dig> contiguous base pairs, the transformed hybridization intensities were stronger than  <dig>  . the space became dichotomized three times  after the first node, by the target gc content . that is, target gc content influenced the hybridization levels in a nonlinear fashion. the residuals were examined, and no obvious pattern was detected.

artificial neural network 
the first-step cv for early stopping was performed to select the appropriate number of hidden nodes to avoid overfitting for the  <dig>  models in each training sets . the model with the minimum sum of square errors at a given subset size p was selected . the generalized errors were calculated in the second-step five-fold cv to decide the appropriate number of variables to retain in the models . the model with minimum cv errors was of subset size  <dig> . the most parsimonious model within one standard error  was the model with four predictors . the majority contained variables x <dig> , x <dig> , and x <dig> , and x <dig>  . two exceptions were the models having x11replaced by x <dig> . this variable substitution is not surprising because x <dig> and x <dig> are linearly highly correlated . interestingly, the rank correlation is much lower than the linear correlation . the target gc content and lengths influenced the hybridization intensities in a nonlinear fashion in addition to the effects of the most contiguous base pair. the residuals were examined with respect to the predictor, and no obvious pattern was detected.

model comparisons
comparison of cv errors among models showed that the multivariate models were superior to the univariate third-order polynomial model proposed earlier  <cit> , and indicated that more than one variable was important for hybridization prediction . regression trees and artificial neural networks improved the prediction by including additional nonlinear effects . the cv correlation provides a summary measure of prediction quality . the selected regression tree using the most contiguous base pairs  and target gc content  outperformed all other chosen models  =  <dig> , p < <10-4; see table  <dig> in additional file 1).

discussion
dna microarrays are widely used for transcriptomic profiling, where the expression of thousands of genes is monitored simultaneously. the correct interpretation of all such microarray experiments depends on reliable and specific signal quantification.

we combined a systematic variable selection scheme with multiple competing multivariate models to improve current predictability of hybridization models for cdna microarrays. variable selection progression using five-fold cross-validation clearly showed that neither the sequence percent identity , the variable identified in previous univariate studies  <cit> , nor the e-value , the variable heuristically used to measure hybridization potentials for arrays  <cit> , was the most predictive independent variable. instead, we found the most contiguous base pairs  to be most predictive when only a single variable was selected . prior to our final analysis using all  <dig> potential predictors, x <dig> to x <dig>  we had performed a preliminary analysis using the first  <dig> potential variables, x <dig> to x <dig>  for all three multivariate models with the same systematic search scheme. the results were fairly consistent with what we found using all  <dig> variables, with the noticeable exception that the most contiguous base pair, x <dig>  was replaced by the smith-waterman alignment score, x <dig>  for all three models, mlrs, rts, and anns . this variable substitution is to be expected because x <dig> and x <dig> are linearly highly correlated . the performance of the most parsimonious models for all methods of our final analyses, which included variable x <dig>  was slightly improved over the preliminary analyses, which used variable x <dig> . although both anns and rts do not have closed-form solutions, the consistent results yielded by the models using  <dig> or  <dig> variables showed the robustness of this method we used.

our result showed that the most contiguous base pair  and target gc content  were the most predictive predictors in the selected regression tree , and it resonates with the finding by wren et al.  <cit> , but with significant improvements. wren et al. only used one predictor, the most contiguous hydrogen bonds, in their model while we examined the relationships between all possible combinations of potential predictors and hybridization. they found that signals above background levels begin at ~ <dig> hydrogen bonds  and become prominent after ~ <dig> hbs  <cit> . as expected, the most contiguous hydrogen bond is highly correlated with the most contiguous base pair  in our study . the selected regression tree in our study showed that hybridizations were strong when more than  <dig> contiguous base pairs were found between probe and target pairs . using the same hydrogen bond conversion , the hydrogen bond numbers for  <dig> base pairs segment are between  <dig> and  <dig>  after separation at node  <dig>  in the regression tree, target gc content  was found to influence hybridizations in a nonlinear fashion by further dichotomizing the decision space three times . node  <dig> separated the second highest intensities with the remaining according to whether gc content exceeds 60%, supporting the intuition that targets having higher gc content have higher hybridization strength with probe sequences. the remaining two nodes divide the remaining space into three regions. the need of nonlinearities in hybridization model is not surprising because there is no straight forward prediction algorithm for prediction of secondary structure or folding energy for long sequences, such as the target sequences in our study. however, folding energy of sequences is generally correlated to gc content as illustrated by the high correlation found in probe gc content and estimated probe folding energy . the nonlinear relationship between target gc content and hybridization may reflect the complex effects and interactions between secondary structure of target sequences and the hybridization between probe and target sequences for microarrays.

predictability of the model could be improved in the future, for instance, by accounting for thermodynamic features, as it is sometimes done for oligonucleotide arrays  <cit> . efforts are also under development to improve the computation speed for large dataset  <cit>  and accommodate the constraints of unequal lengths between probe/target sequences and for long sequences in real world data  <cit> .

recently, after "jaw dropping" discordant results  <cit>  among array platforms were reported  <cit> , reproducibility across-platform has become a research topic of intense interest  <cit> . one of the contributing factors to the inconsistencies across platforms is thought to be due to the intrinsic differences of each array platforms  <cit> . the systematic multivariate approach proposed here can easily be applied to understand platform-specific hybridization processes, and this can potentially improve the comparability across platforms.

the major limitation of our model development is the use of a small dataset. at this point, the analysis of a relatively simple and small system seems to be the only way forward. our proposed method should thus be seen as the first step toward understanding more fully the complexities surrounding cross-hybridization in other, larger systems. the hope behind our work is that scientists will begin to generate larger and more generalized datasets with hybridization between many targets and probes , so that better and more widely applicable models may be developed in the near future.

CONCLUSIONS
we proposed and validated a systematic strategy using multiple competing multivariate models to select critical sequence characteristics and quantify their relationship with hybridization on microarrays. the multivariate models outperformed the currently used univariate model in all cases. the most contiguous base pairs and the target gc content were found to be significant predictors of hybridization. our systematic approach offers a quantitative method to correct for cross-hybridization signals on microarrays and shows the benefit of modeling nonlinear interdependencies between predictors and hybridization intensities.
