BACKGROUND
baculovirus has been used widely to express recombinant proteins in insect cells and larvae  <cit> . autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus  has been the most commonly used baculovirus for recombinant protein production  <cit> . baculovirus infection can be divided to three distinct phases, early, late and very late phase. while budding virus  is produced in the late phase, the occlusion derived virus  form is produced in the very late phase. the bv form has a width of  <dig> nm and a length of 250- <dig> nm  <cit>  has been used as a nanoparticle  <cit>  in a baculovirus surface displaying system. odv form can also be used as nanoparticles, because odv-polyhedrin particles are resistant to heat and light inactivation, whereas bv is more sensitive to environment. cultured insect cells are used to produce and amplify recombinant acmnpv, which means that large-scale cultivation of insect cells is also needed to produce recombinant baculovirus particles. by contrast, silkworm bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus  was recently used for the large-scale production of recombinant proteins and baculovirus particles owing to its ability to infect silkworm larvae and pupae  <cit> . silkworms can rapidly produce a high level of recombinant proteins and baculovirus particles with bmnpv bacmids  <cit> . for example, ~ <dig>  mg of purified human α <dig> -sialyltransferase was obtained from only  <dig> silkworm larvae injected with recombinant bacmid harboring α <dig> -sialyltransferase gene  <cit> . predicted amino acid sequences of corresponding orfs of bmnpv are closely related to those of acmnpv   <cit> .

once established, the baculovirus display system can be used to produce baculoviruses displaying functional peptides, receptors and antigens that enable the delivery of heterologous gene expression in mammalian cells and tissues, as well as the production of antibodies and vaccines  <cit> . baculovirus has an envelope protein  that comprises an n-terminal signal peptide, a mature domain, a transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic domain at its c-terminus. heterogeneous peptides and proteins can be displayed on the surface of baculovirus envelope by fusion with either the full-length gp <dig> or its transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains  <cit> . some transmembrane proteins can be also displayed on the surface of baculovirus without fusing with any domain  <cit> . several enzymes and receptors can be displayed with its native form  <cit>  and receptor-displaying baculoviruses are used for specific protein-protein interaction detection and the expression cloning of cd <dig> cdna from cdna expression libraries by magnetic separation. as an alternative baculovirus display system, baculovirus capsid display has been also established by fusion with a nucleocapsid protein, vp <dig>  for transduction imaging  <cit> . the baculovirus display system is also becoming more important in the life sciences as an addition to the baculovirus expression system.

recently, many studies have reported that human prorenin receptor , and its mechanism of binding to renin/prorenin, involves the generation or action of angiotensin, leading to numerous cardiovascular diseases  <cit> . consequently, the development of hprr receptor blockers is currently receiving considerable attention. also, an understanding of the functional properties of hprr through detailed biochemical and biophysical analysis is required. in a previous study, hprr fused with gfpuv at its n-terminus  was expressed and purified from the fat body of silkworm larvae infected with recombinant baculovirus  <cit> . however, the binding capacity of purified gfpuv-hprr to human prorenin was reduced compared with that before purification. possible reasons might be that the protein structure is broken or that the recognition sites become buried inside the molecule during purification. in the current study, we attempted to display gfpuv-hprr on the surface of bmnpv and to purify the baculovirus particles from silkworm larval hemolymph using size-exclusion chromatography . purified baculovirus particles were characterized and used to detect the interaction of gfpuv-hprr and human prorenin by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay .

RESULTS
improvement of purification efficiency of bmnpv particles
as detailed in a previous report  <cit> , hprr-displayed bmnpv  was produced in silkworm larvae and purified by sec. its sec recovery efficiency was ~35% and decreased by 4% with ultracentrifugation to concentrate the baculovirus particles. final bmnpv particle concentration was  <dig>  ×  <dig> pfu ml- <dig>  <cit> . in the current study, bmnpv-gfpuv-hprr was produced and purified using the same methods as detailed in  <cit> . gfpuv-hprr was detected in purified bmnpv-gfpuv-hprr particles, but not in purified protease negative bmnpv-cp--ggt <dig> particles, which harbor the gene encoding human β <dig> -n-acetylglucosaminyltransferase  <dig> fused with the gene encoding gfpuv  instead of the gene encoding gfpuv-hprr   <cit> . the faint band  found on analysis of the purified bmnpv-cp--ggt <dig> particles is likely to represent an, as yet, unspecified molecule. this kind of band could sometimes be detected using anti-flag. the estimated molecular weight of the gfpuv-ggt <dig> fusion protein is ~ <dig> kda, larger than that of gfpuv-hprr , indicating this band is not derived from ggt <dig>  recovery of bmnpv-gfpuv-hprr particles was 29% using sec.

to improve the recovery efficiency of bmnpv-gfpuv-hprr, bmnpv-gfpuv-hprr particles were suspended with pbs containing  <dig> % each of the detergents triton x- <dig>  tween  <dig> and pf- <dig>  after ultracentrifugation. using purification, the recovery efficiency of baculovirus particles was  <dig> % without detergent. using pbs containing  <dig> % of each detergent as a suspension buffer after ultracentrifugation, particle purity and the recovery efficiency improved. for example, when pf- <dig> was used purity was increased higher  <dig> times to that of hemolymph, but recovery efficiency was low . using triton x- <dig> the recovery ratio was approximately ten times more than for pbs alone and particle purity was  <dig> times more than that of hemolymph .

sephacryl s- <dig> chromatography was then performed using pbs containing each concentration  of triton x- <dig> or tween  <dig>  the recovery efficiency of bmnpv-gfpuv-hprr particles was improved in the presence of detergent. for example, in the presence of  <dig> % triton x- <dig>  its efficiency was 86%, which was threefold more than using pbs alone .

* this purification protocol was repeated several times and typical result is shown.

however, its recovery efficiency decreased in the presence of  <dig> % triton x- <dig>  which indicates that a high detergent concentration was deleterious to bmnpv particles. to confirm this effect, purified bmnpv particles were treated with each concentration  of triton x- <dig>  in the presence of 1% triton x- <dig>  gfpuv-hprr amount in the pellet fraction was lower than that of  <dig>  or  <dig> % treatment . proteins were solubilized less under the  <dig> % tritonx- <dig> treatment compared with the  <dig> % or 1% triton x- <dig> treatment. however, as the concentration of triton x- <dig> was increased, more amounts of gp <dig> and other proteins were solubilized into the supernatant fraction. it was previously reported that gfpuv-hprr was not solubilized from the microsome fraction of silkworm fat body efficiently by triton x- <dig>  <cit> . considering the result of table  <dig>  <dig> % tritonx- <dig> treatment are milder to baculovirus envelope than  <dig> % or 1% triton x- <dig> treatment.

confirmation of surface display of gfpuv-hprr on the bmnpv particles with proteinase k
to confirm the surface display of gfpuv-hprr on the bmnpv particles, purified bmnpv-gfpuv-hprr particles were treated with proteinase k . if gfpuv-hprr was displayed on the surface of the bmnpv particles, it would be degraded by a less amount of proteinase k than would the vp <dig> protein, which is a nucleocapsid protein localized inside bmnpv particles. in the presence of  <dig>  μg proteinase k, vp <dig> was detected, but hprr was not , suggesting that displayed gfpuv-hprr on the surface of bmnpv particles had been degraded. in the presence of  <dig>  or  <dig> μg of proteinase k, hprr and vp <dig> were both degraded.

quantification of gfpuv-hprr displayed on the surface of bmnpv particles
to quantify gfpuv-hprr displayed on the surface of bmnpv particles, an elisa technique was used. bmnpv-gfpuv-hprr particles were immobilized in the wells and hprr was detected by elisa . bmnpv-cp--ggt <dig>  which does not display hprr on the surface of bmnpv particles, was used as a negative control. first, hprr purified from insect cells  <cit>  was used as a standard and a calibration curve of hprr was made. a liner relationship was observed between  <dig> and  <dig> ng of hprr with a correlation coefficient of  <dig>  . absorbance was higher for bmnpv-gfpuv-hprr than for bmnpv-cp--ggt <dig>  indicating that bmnpv-gfpuv-hprr was displayed on the surface of bmnpv particles . based on this result,  <dig>  ng of gfpuv-hprr was displayed on the surface of  <dig> ng of bmnpv-gfpuv-hprr proteins and ~ <dig> % of total proteins in bmnpv-gfpuv-hprr was gfpuv-hprr. this value was similar to that calculated by densitometry from the results of a western blot .

application of gfpuv-hprr displaying bmnpv to protein-protein interaction detection
previously, sakihama et al. reported that specific interactions between cd2-displaying acmnpv particles and cd58-displaying acmnpv particles could be detected by elisa and that baculovirus surface display technology was therefore applicable to protein-protein interaction detection  <cit> . the binding of hprr to its ligand, human prorenin, was detected using bmnpv-gfpuv-hprr particles by elisa. human prorenin was immobilized on the wells and then incubated with purified bmnpv-gfpuv-hprr particles . gfpuv-hprr displaying on the surface of bmnpv particles bind to human prorenin immobilized onto the plate, and then are detected by elisa using mouse anti-flag m <dig> and hrp-conjugated anti-mouse igg as primary and secondary antibodies . significant absorbance of bmnpv-gfpuv-hprr was detected compared to only a buffer or bmnpv-cp--ggt <dig>  which does not display hprr on its surface. this result indicates that bmnpv surface display is applicable to protein-protein interaction detection; in addition elisas based on this bmnpv system could be used in the screening of hprr blockers.

discussion
baculovirus has been used widely for recombinant protein production, and recently as a surface display system. some transmembrane proteins are displayed on the baculovirus surface without any fusion with the baculovirus envelope protein  <cit> . baculoviruses that display transmembrane proteins on their surfaces are suitable for use in elisas, for the expression cloning of a gene from a cdna library and for making proteoliposomes  <cit> . in particular, baculovirus particles can be used as probes for the expression cloning of receptors and ligands from cdna libraries using magnetic sorting and flowcytometric analysis  <cit> . this method enabled the cloning of cd <dig> cdna from a human t-cell cdna library using cd <dig> displaying acmnpv particles.

previously, we reported the production of high titers of bmnpv displaying hprr in silkworm larvae  <cit> . when the bmnpv-gfpuv-hprr particles were purified by sephacryl s- <dig> column chromatography without using detergent, the recovery yield of particles was only 30%  <cit> , which was similar to that of this work . in the current study, we were able to purify hprr-displaying bmnpv particles from the hemolymph of silkworm larvae with high recovery in the presence of  <dig> % triton x- <dig> . in the case of virus-like particles , these can be stabilized and prevented from aggregation and precipitation by using non-ionic detergents and other compounds  <cit> . our results suggest that the high level of recovery of baculovirus particles in the presence of triton x- <dig> might result from inhibition of particle aggregation by triton x- <dig>  moreover, non-ionic detergents can prevent the adsorption of protein to surfaces  <cit> . in our experiments, the optimal use of a non-ionic detergent contributed the high recovery of baculovirus particles. however, when a higher-than-optimal amount of detergent was used , the displayed protein was solubilized . these results suggest that the deleterious effect of high detergent concentration during purification of bmnpv-gfpuv-hprr particles was caused by the loss of envelope proteins on the surface of the particles. in table  <dig>  although protein concentration of triton x-100-suspended fraction was the same as that of pbs-suspended one, purity of triton x-100-suspended bmnpv particles and recovery ratio were 11% higher than that of pbs-suspended ones. this suggests that the presence of  <dig> % triton x- <dig> is effective for the purification of bmnpv particles from silkworm larval hemolymph.

aggregation is a major problem in the production, purification and concentration of viruses  <cit> . it has also been reported that virus instability is due to the aggregation of virus particles, which results in their precipitation  <cit> . to obtain high titer of virus stocks, viruses have to be concentrated. however, such high titers are prone to aggregate during purification and concentration steps. in the current study, we were able to purify high titers of bmnpv particles displaying hprr from the hemolymph of silkworm larvae without aggregation in the presence of  <dig> % triton x- <dig> and to omit the concentration step. silkworms can produce higher titers of baculoviruses than cultured cells, sf- <dig> and sf- <dig> cells. the method of using silkworm larvae and sec in the presence of triton x- <dig> is therefore useful for the high-titer preparation of functional bmnpv particles displaying heterogeneous transmembrane proteins or ligands.

in this study, ~3% of total proteins of bmnpv particles were displayed as gfpuv-hprr. gp <dig> is a major protein in the envelope of baculoviruses. the display of heterogeneous proteins and peptides can be also achieved by the fusion with gp <dig>  <cit> . more hprr can be displayed by the fusion with the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of gp <dig> than with those of hprr because of the abundance of gp <dig> in the baculovirus envelope. the envelope glycoprotein of human immunodeficiency virus  can be incorporated into hiv virus-like particles by the replacement of its native transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains with those of gp <dig>  <cit> . the cytoplasmic domain might be important for incorporating the hiv envelope protein into the lipid bilayer of envelope viruses and virus-like particles and for it to stably reside in its envelope. the cytoplasmic domain of the transmembrane domain might be also important for displaying on the surface of baculovirus particles.

displaying gfpuv-hprr on its surface was detected by elisa using mouse anti-flag m <dig> and hrp-conjugated anti-mouse igg antibodies without solubilization and purification of hprr. gfpuv-hprr on the surface of bmnpv particles was confirmed as an active form by binding to human prorenin immobilized onto the plate. however, accuracy of elisa was not high enough, because of small difference of detected absorbance between bmnpv-gfpuv-hprr and negative control . this elisa can be improved by using anti-gp <dig> antibody as a primary antibody because gp <dig> is displayed on the surface of bmnpv particles far more than gfpuv-hprr. moreover, this elisa has to be improved for more precise binding analysis. for example, the activation of human prorenin by its binding to hprr might be detected by immobilization of the hprr-displaying bmnpv particles onto the plate. this elisa is simple and convenient compared to previous method  <cit>  and a new elisa for the analysis of hprr and hprr blockers screening can be established based on bmnpv surface display system.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown here that the bmnpv surface display system can be utilized in protein-protein interaction detection. a large-scale production of bmnpv particles can be performed using silkworm larvae and high titer of bmnpv particles can be purified from hemolymph using sec with a high recovery ratio. this bmnpv-silkworm system could be used for the efficient and effective application of baculovirus particles as nanoparticles because of the scale on which baculovirus particles can be produced and the low cost and simple protocol of that production.
