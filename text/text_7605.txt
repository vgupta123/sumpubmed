BACKGROUND
rna interference  is an evolutionary conserved mechanism for regulating gene expression. it plays an important role in defense against viruses but also in development and in normal functioning of the cell  <cit> . the natural rnai mechanism functions by endogenous microrna  molecules, which are synthesized in cells as part of longer primary rna transcripts . pri-mirnas are cleaved by the nuclear drosha-dgcr <dig> complex to produce mirna precursors  of  <dig> nucleotides , which are then transported by exportin  <dig> to the cytoplasm and processed by the rnase iii endonuclease family enzyme dicer to produce a mature mirna duplex of ~ <dig>  basepairs . the guide strand of the mirna enters a multiprotein rna-induced silencing complex  where it is used for sequence-specific recognition of target messenger rna . risc binding to complementary sequences on the target mrna results in transcript degradation or translational repression  <cit> .

by introducing molecules that constitute substrates for the endogenous rnai pathway disease-related mrna and thus protein translation can be inhibited. rnai in cells can be induced in different ways. generally this is achieved by delivery of 20–25 bp-long small interfering rnas   <cit>  which serve as substrates for the risc complex. alternatively, sirnas can be generated by expressing short hairpin rna   <cit>  or artificial microrna  structures  <cit> . both enter the endogenous rnai pathway and are processed into mature sirnas. the crucial difference between shrnas and artificial mirnas is in their secondary structure and processing in the rnai pathway. shrnas are normally expressed from polymerase iii  promoters and directly generate a mature product which is exported and processed by dicer, while mirnas require an additional step of excision from the longer pre-mirna sequence by the drosha-dgcr <dig> complex. moreover, mirnas are expressed from polymerase ii  promoters that allow for the use of tissue-specific or regulated expression systems.

to date, shrna expression from pol iii promoters is the most common way to induce rnai in cells, which provides potent and stable target inhibition. several pol iii promoters are being used for expression of shrnas, such as h <dig> or u <dig>  and transcription initiation and termination sites together with the structural requirements for effective expression of the hairpins are well described  <cit> . however, there are serious disadvantages of pol iii expression systems which question their possible application as therapeutic agents. there are cases reporting severe toxicity after administration of high doses of vectors encoding shrna  <cit> . toxicity was shown to be associated with oversaturation of the cellular rnai machinery and changes in endogenous mirna expression.

this toxicity problem may be circumvented by using weaker pol ii promoter to express shrnas or by embedding sirna into artificial mirna scaffolds. the cmv promoter has been the first pol ii promoter shown to express active shrna and initial requirements for this approach have been established: the shrna has to be juxtaposed to the transcription start site   and followed by the minimal polyadenylation signal   <cit> . when these two conditions were not met, the shrna was found to be inactive. additionally, to limit toxicity tissue-specific pol ii promoters which restrict expression to the target tissue can be applied. this approach has been used to safely express shrnas targeting jnk <dig>  jnk <dig>  and pi <dig> under the control of the prostate-specific antigen pol ii promoter in androgen-responsive cancer cells  <cit> . furthermore, in vivo toxicity related to high shrna expression levels from a pol iii promoter was abolished when the shrna was expressed from the liver-specific pol ii haat promoter and u <dig> termination signal was used  <cit> . incorporation of a sirna sequence in an artificial mirna scaffold has been shown to abolish shrna-induced neuronal cell death and to avoid disruption of the endogenous rnai pathway  <cit> .

in the current study we focused on the structural requirements to determine the optimal configuration for pol ii shrna expression and compared it to the pol ii expression of artificial mirna. to date, no detailed studies on the hairpin positions, transcription termination signal , and shrna stem length requirements for efficient pol ii shrna expression have been performed. varying positions of the hairpin relative to the tss + <dig> or + <dig>  stem length of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  29 bp and different tts  have been tested for a shrna targeting luciferase  and expressed from the pol ii cmv promoter. shluc at + <dig> location relative to tss, with stem length of  <dig> nt with either pa or u <dig> termination signal was found to yield optimal results. however, the average luciferase inhibition of 40% was still lower than the control pol iii h1-shrna, which inhibited luciferase up to 90%. additionally, two shrnas targeting apob  were found inactive when expressed from cmv using the same configuration. in contrast, when the three shrnas were incorporated in an artificial mirna scaffold, two were equally active to their respective h1-shrna controls while expressing much less sirna molecules. this indicates that using artificial mirna scaffolds has a greater therapeutic potential than direct expression of shrnas from pol ii promoters.

RESULTS
design and knockdown efficacy of cmv-shluc with different transcription start and transcription termination signals
previously, we have identified a highly effective sirna potent in knocking down luciferase when expressed as shrna from the pol iii h <dig> promoter   <cit> . to minimize the risk of inducing toxic effects due to sirna over expression we wanted to express the same shluc sequence under the control of the pol ii cmv promoter. in contrast to pol iii, most pol ii transcripts undergo posttranscriptional modification at the 5' and 3' ends, which enhances their stability and protects them from degradation  <cit> . however, both 5’ and 3’ overhangs of the shrna are important for correct recognition and processing by dicer  <cit>  therefore these sequences needed to be optimized. a panel of shluc constructs with perfect complementary 20-bp shrna stem and 9-nt loop was expressed from the pol ii cmv promoter . initially, shluc was placed behind the cmv promoter, followed by a minimal pa signal. the beginning of the passenger strand of the shluc sequence was placed at positions + <dig> or + <dig> relative to the tss generating cmv + 5shluc-pa and cmv + 6shluc-pa, respectively . it has been reported that t <dig> tts can be used instead of pa signal in a cmv-shrna expression cassette  <cit> . therefore, this termination signal was used in the +5shluc and +6shluc constructs instead of pa, resulting in cmv + 5shluc-t <dig> and cmv + 6shluc-t <dig>  finally, the u <dig> termination signal was cloned behind +6shluc, resulting in cmv + 6shluc-u <dig>  to compare their inhibitory effect, hek293t cells were co-transfected with the different variants of cmv-shluc together with the firefly luciferase reporter. shrna targeting gfp  was included as a negative control and renilla luciferase expression was measured to correct for experimental conditions. the ratio firefly/renilla in the negative control was set as 100% and relative inhibition of the luciferase reporter was calculated. all cmv-shluc constructs appeared less effective in inhibiting luciferase compared to the pol iii h1-shluc control . the maximum inhibition of luciferase achieved was 22% and 36% for cmv + 5shluc-pa and cmv + 6shluc-pa constructs, respectively. cmv + 6shluc-u <dig> inhibited luciferase expression with only 18%. cmv + 5shluc-t <dig> and cmv + 6shluc-t <dig> constructs were not effective at all.

design and knockdown efficacy of cmv-shluc with different hairpin stem length
the length of the stem in the shrna has been found to be important for dicer processing resulting in enhancement of the silencing potential of a given hairpin  <cit> . dicer recognizes double-stranded rna and cleaves 21– <dig> nt to produce mature sirna. to check whether extending stem length of shluc would improve its efficacy as a result of better dicer processing, constructs with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 29 bp stem were designed by extending the 5’ end of the guide strand, resulting in shluc <dig>  shluc <dig>  shluc <dig> and shluc <dig> variants . based on our previous findings shluc was placed at + <dig> site and followed by pa or u <dig> termination signal. luciferase knockdown was measured to determine the efficacy of the extended stem length constructs . improved efficacy was observed when extending hairpin stem to  <dig> bp for both pa  and u <dig> tts . this improvement was statistically significant for pa tts  while change for u <dig> tts was not significant . further lengthening of the shluc hairpin stem to  <dig> and 29 bp did not change the inhibitory effect of these constructs .

design and knockdown efficacy of cmv-shrna and artificial mirna targeting luciferase or apolipoprotein b <dig> 
previously, h1-shapob <dig> and h1-shapob <dig> have been used to inhibit in vitro and in vivo the expression of apob that is the structural protein of low density lipoprotein cholesterol   <cit>  . to evaluate whether the structural requirements for expression of shrna from the cmv promoter, + <dig> tss and pa tts apply not only to luciferase-targeting constructs, two cmv-shrnas targeting apob were designed and named cmv-shapob <dig> and cmv-shapob <dig>  respectively. as an alternative strategy for direct pol ii expression of shrna, artificial mirna scaffolds incorporating sirna targeting luciferase or apob were designed by substituting the mature mirna sequence with luciferase and apob target sequences, resulting in cmv-miluc, cmv-miapob <dig> and cmv-miapob <dig> . the pri-mirna structure contains additional flanking sequences at the 5' and 3' ends of the hairpin, which enables correct recognition and processing by the rnai pathway enzymes drosha and dicer. the 5' and 3' flanking sequences of pri-mir <dig> were used, therefore design and optimization of the sequences up- or downstream of the mirna hairpin are not required for effective knockdown. knockdown efficacy of cmv-shrnas and cmv-mirnas was determined on their specific luciferase reporters, containing apob target sequences in case of shapob and miapob constructs. h1-shluc, h1-shapob <dig> and h1-shapob <dig> were used as positive controls and h1-shscr, cmv-shscr and cmv-miscr, not targeting any sequence in the human genome, were used as negative controls. luciferase expression in the negative controls was set at 100% and the relative inhibition of luciferase reporters was calculated . cmv-shapob <dig> and cmv-shapob <dig> inhibited luciferase reporters by 22% and 8% respectively , which is similar to the knockdown observed with cmv + 6shluc20-pa . by contrast, cmv-miapob <dig> and cmv-miapob <dig> were found to inhibit luciferase reporters up to 57% and 75% respectively . cmv-miluc was not more active than cmv + 6shluc20-pa even though it was designed the same way as cmv-miapob <dig> and cmv-miapob <dig> .

quantification of sirna molecules processed from the different shrna and mirna scaffolds
next, we wanted to determine if the inhibitory effect of the shrna and artificial mirna constructs correlates with the amount of processed sirna molecules in the cell. for siluc, siapob <dig> and siapob <dig> sequences, small rna specific taqman assay was designed for detecting the guide strand . ten-fold dilutions  of the guide strand of each synthetic sirna oligo were used to create a standard line . all sirna assays showed a clear exponential correlation between the amplification pattern and the amount of sirna standard. the small rna taqman assay relies on the hybridization of stem-loop rt primers to the mature guide strand and in some cases the method could show insufficient specificity, amplifying the precursor shrna hairpin or nonspecifically binding to another sirna molecule. to exclude this possibility, we investigated the ability of the siapob <dig> and siapob <dig> assays to differentiate between the mature sirna molecules, their shapob <dig> or shapob <dig> hairpin precursors and expression plasmids by performing additional taqman experiments. the primers and probes specifically amplified only the corresponding synthetic sirna standard and no aspecific amplification was detected for the shrna hairpin oligo or expression plasmid suggesting that the small rna taqman assays were highly specific for the mature siapob <dig> or siapob <dig>  having confirmed that properly processed sirna molecules can be specifically detected, we proceeded with detection and quantification of the amount of sirna molecules per cell for h1-shrna, cmv-shrna and cmv-mirna constructs . for all constructs an amplification chart was created and the amount of molecules was calculated. the exponential amplification for h1-shluc began at  <dig> cycles, while it began later for both cmv-shluc and cmv-miluc  . the expression of siluc molecules was 125-fold lower when expressed as cmv-shluc and 10-fold lower when expressed as cmv-miluc compared to h1-shluc, which resulted in  <dig> sirna molecules per cell . the exponential amplification for h1-shapob <dig> began at  <dig> cycles, at cycles  <dig> for cmv-shapob <dig> and at  <dig> cycles for cmv-miapob <dig> . this represents 12-fold less molecules expressed with cmv-shapob <dig> and 2-fold less for cmv-miapob <dig> compared to h1-shapob <dig>  which resulted in  <dig> sirna molecules . siapob <dig> molecules were not detected as efficiently as siluc and siapob <dig> thus the exponential amplification started later: for h1-shapob <dig>  it began at  <dig> cycles, at  <dig> cycles for cmv-shapob <dig> and at  <dig> cycles for cmv-miapob <dig> . this represented 49-fold less molecules expressed with cmv-shapob <dig> and 32-fold less for cmv-miapob <dig> compared to h1-shapob <dig>  which resulted in  <dig> molecules per cell .

endogenous apob mrna knockdown
in order to assess the inhibitory effect of shapob <dig>  shapob <dig>  miapob <dig> and miapob <dig> constructs on endogenous apob expression the mouse hepatoma hepa1- <dig> cell line was selected. cells were transfected with h1-shapob <dig>  cmv-shapob <dig> and cmv-miapob <dig> or with their equivalent constructs having apob <dig> as a target. two days post transfection rna was isolated and apob mrna expression was determined by rt-qpcr. both h1-shapob <dig> and cmv-miapob <dig> efficiently inhibited apob mrna up to 70% and 50% respectively . an even stronger effect was observed for h1-shapob <dig> and cmv-miapob <dig> which inhibited apob mrna both up to 85% . cmv-shapob <dig> and cmv-shapob <dig> showed no inhibition of endogenous apob expression, which confirms the results on luciferase reporters inhibition  and shows the specificity of the designed constructs.

discussion
there are few examples of successful shrna expression using pol ii promoters. although several requirements for pol ii shrna expression have been established, optimization and direct assessment of different hairpin stem lengths, tss and tts have not been performed. in the current study we evaluated the relevance of these factors by positioning shrnas targeting luciferase or apob at + <dig> or + <dig> relative to the cmv tss and added the t <dig>  pa or u <dig> tts at the 3’ end of the hairpins. additionally, the same sirna sequences were incorporated in artificial mirna scaffolds and direct evaluation between the silencing efficacy and processing of pol ii-expressed shrna and mirna was performed.

the nucleotide distance between the promoter, the shrna structure and the tts determines the length and sequence composition of the 5’ and 3’ overhangs of the expressed hairpin. both ends act as reference points for recognition and proper processing by dicer  <cit> . initial rules published by xia et al. include shrna location within  <dig> nt from the tss and pa tts  <cit> . later shrna containing t <dig> and u <dig> tts where also found to be active when substituted for pa  <cit> . these settings were used in our study to express shrna from the cmv promoter. the shluc, shapob <dig> and shapob <dig> sequences have been previously validated as potent inhibitors of their targets when expressed from the pol iii h <dig> promoter  <cit> . surprisingly, all cmv-shluc constructs induced only a mild target inhibition when the hairpin was placed at + <dig> tss and t <dig> or pa tts were used. in contrast to previously published data, the use of u <dig> tts did not improve silencing efficacy. by shifting the hairpin from + <dig> to + <dig> from tss, thus minimizing the 5’ overhang, no significant improvement was achieved and the effect was not dependent of tts used. additionally, the cmv-shapob <dig> and cmv-shapob <dig> hairpins were ineffective when the initial settings of + <dig> tss and pa tts were used, indicating that those settings cannot be used as a general rule for pol ii shrna expression.

the length of the shrna hairpin stem has been shown to play an important role in silencing efficacy as it can lead to differential processing into multiple sirnas  <cit> . in the current study we optimized the pol ii shrna expression by testing stem lengths of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 29 bp. slight increase in silencing efficacy was observed only when extending hairpin stem from  <dig> to 21 bp but not when the stem length was further extended to  <dig> or 29 bp. mcintyre et al. performed a similar study by extending the shrna stem length from  <dig> to 41 bp and looked at the core placement of the shrna  <cit> . while the processing of hairpins was clearly dependent on the stem length, the activity was primarily dependent on the sequence of processed products. consistent with their data, our results suggest that there is no strict correlation between the increase in stem length and better silencing activity of the shrnas. here, we focused only on pol ii expression of shrna but an alternative approach would be to express long hairpin rna  where the stem length is extended up to 300 bp  <cit> . using lhrna allows generating multiple sirna from a single transcript, which can be used for viral infections or cancer, where multiple sequences have to be targeted. to date, expression of active lhrna from pol ii promoter has not been successful due to inefficient processing of the hairpins by the rnai machinery, and detailed studies on tss, tts and hairpin location, similar to those for shrna are lacking.

an alternative to optimizing pol ii expression of shrna is to use pre-mirna scaffolds and replace the mature mirna sequence with sirna targeting a gene of interest. cellular mirnas are naturally expressed from pol ii promoters  <cit> . therefore, when shluc, shapob <dig> and shapob <dig> were expressed from the pri-mir- <dig> scaffold the knockdown efficacy was significantly improved. importantly, artificial mirna have been found to be less toxic in vitro and in vivo compared to shrna as they do not disrupt the endogenous rnai pathway. mcbride et al. used this approach to target huntingtin mrna and to avoid neurotoxicity caused by overexpression of shrna  <cit> . similarly, incorporation of a sirna against spinocerebellar ataxia  <dig> protein into an artificial mirna abolished neuronal cell death observed with a shrna harboring the same sirna sequence  <cit> . in a previous study we have provided evidence for the efficacy of liver-specific expression of artificial mirna targeting apob in vivo and demonstrated its advantages over the pol iii-expressed shrna . in conclusion, we and others have shown that pol ii expression of artificial mirna scaffolds is a more robust and promising approach than pol ii shrna expression, probably due to the specific structural characteristics of the mirna.

an additional advantage of the use of artificial mirnas is that several precursors can be expressed as clusters from longer transcripts, allowing simultaneous targeting of multiple genes  <cit> . this feature of the mirna is very important when mutation-prone viruses, such as hiv- <dig> or hcv, are targeted or when several disease-related genes need to be simultaneously silenced. moreover, mirnas can be linked to the 3’ untranslated region of a therapeutic gene, which is an additional advantage for therapeutic applications since it allows co-delivery of a codon-optimized gene together with a mirna targeting the disease-causing version of the same gene. such combinational therapy has been shown for alpha1-antitrypsin  deficiency, in which a hairpin rna targeting mutated aat transcript was delivered together with codon-optimized aat gene  <cit> .

quantification of the sirna molecules expressed from the h1-shrna, cmv-shrna or cmv-mirna constructs was highly specific and revealed differences in the amount of processed sirna molecules per cell. as expected, highest sirna amounts were detected when the shrnas were expressed from the strong h <dig> promoter. however, when the same shrnas were expressed from the cmv promoter, 12- to 125-fold less sirna molecules were detected indicating that either the shrna was not efficiently transcribed from the cmv promoter or that there was impaired sirna processing by the rnai machinery. surprisingly, the amount of processed sirna from the cmv-mirna constructs did not correlate with efficacy. for example, cmv-miluc yielded  <dig> siluc molecules per cell and was completely ineffective in target knockdown while cmv-miapob <dig> yielded only  <dig> siapob <dig> molecules per cell and was highly efficient. a possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the small rna taqman assay detects only one variant of the guide strand and although identical predicted sirna sequences were incorporated in the cmv-shrna and cmv-mirna scaffolds, they can still be processed differently. indeed, our newest data based on next generation sequencing  of small rnas from cells transfected with h1-shapob <dig> and cmv-miapob <dig> indicates differential processing and different mature sequences from the two scaffolds . the sirnas originating from the h1-shrna were more heterogeneous in cleavage sites and length compared to the products originating from the cmv-mirna scaffold supporting the notion that dicer cleavage is less precise than the combination of drosha and dicer. unfortunately, ngs data from pol ii-expressed shrna, which would allow verifying the processed sirna variants and their abundance, are still not available.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our results demonstrate that it is currently difficult to draw rules for efficient pol ii shrna expression and processing. optimization of the shrna stem length, tss and tts did not result in better silencing efficacy for any of the cmv-expressed shrnas. on the other hand, when identical predicted sequences were incorporated in mirna scaffolds, two out of three sequences resulted in potent inhibition of luciferase reporters and endogenous mrna. our data question the application of the previously published rules for pol ii shrna expression as general standards. the rules for design of potent shrna expressed from pol ii promoters are still far from clear and they can be used rather as reference points. still detailed empirical optimization of hairpin location seems to be required for every target and pol ii promoter used. we consider that embedding sirna in artificial mirna scaffold and expression from pol ii promoter is a better and approach than direct pol ii shrna expression due to the intrinsic characteristics of the mirna structure rendering it a better substrate for the rnai machinery.
