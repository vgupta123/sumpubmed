BACKGROUND
among eukaryotes, analyses of the human and mouse genomes revealed that more than 10% of the genes are arranged as bidirectional gene pairs that are separated by less than only  <dig> kb of genomic dna  <cit> . some of these gene pairs could have evolved from a common ancestral gene during its duplication. other gene pairs, however, do not have any genetic relationship between each other, and they are thought to play different biological functions within cells. it has been reported that the human pacpg-park <dig> gene pair  <cit> , the human prepl-c2orf <dig> gene pair  <cit> , the mouse surfeit surf1-surf <dig> gene pair  <cit>  and the mouse sars2-mrps <dig> gene pair  <cit>  are co-regulated by distinctive transcriptional factors such as nrf- <dig>  yy- <dig> or nf-y. the transcriptional regulation of many other eukaryotic bidirectional gene pairs, however, remains to be determined.

recently, we identified creld <dig> as a novel er stress-inducible gene by a microarray analysis of tg-sensitive genes in neuro2a cells and characterized the 5'-upstream promoter region of the mouse creld <dig> gene  <cit> . some pathophysiological conditions are reported to disrupt er functions  due to an accumulation of unfolded proteins  <cit> . the accumulation of unfolded proteins activates the expression of various genes through three resident er stress sensors, perk  <cit> , ire  <cit>  and atf <dig>  <cit> . the activation of these genes results in various outcomes . one of these er stress sensors, atf <dig>  directly regulates the transcription of the creld <dig> gene via the erse motif, an atf <dig> consensus sequence, located in its promoter  <cit> . the nucleotide sequence around the erse in the creld <dig> promoter is highly conserved within the mouse, rat and human genes. interestingly, further genomic analyses reveal that the alg <dig> gene, one of the mannosyltransferase genes  <cit> , is adjacent to the creld <dig> gene in a head-to-head configuration on the chromosome in some species. in this study, we first investigated the transcriptional regulation of the bidirectional creld2-alg <dig> gene pair as er stress-inducible genes. we especially focused on evaluating the role of the erse motif, which is located within the 360-bp intergenic region, in regulating the expression of both genes under er-stress conditions.

RESULTS
er stress induced the expression of both creld <dig> and alg <dig> mrnas in neuro2a cells
microarray analyses revealed that both creld <dig> and alg <dig> mrnas are induced in tg-treated cells as well as gadd <dig>  <cit> , tib <dig>  <cit>  and herpud <dig>  <cit>  mrna, which are known er stress-inducible genes . to verify the tg-induced expression of creld <dig> and alg <dig> mrnas in detail, neuro2a cells were exposed to  <dig>  μm tg for  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> h, and the expression of creld <dig>  alg <dig>  grp <dig> and gadd <dig> mrnas were measured by rt-pcr. as shown in figure 1a, creld <dig> and alg <dig> mrnas, as well as grp <dig>  <cit>  and gadd <dig> mrnas, were up-regulated from  <dig> to  <dig> h after tg-treatment. next we examined the effects of other er stress-inducing reagents , as well as serum withdrawal, on creld <dig> and alg <dig> mrna expression in neuro2a cells. like tg treatment, those with tm and bfa, but not serum withdrawal, induced creld <dig>  alg <dig>  grp <dig> and gadd <dig> mrna expression similarly .

neuro2a cells were treated with or without  <dig>  μm tg for  <dig> or  <dig> h. total rna was isolated from each cells and subjected to identify tg-inducible genes using microarray analysis as described in methods. representative genes are shown as ratio .

comparison of the intergenic sequences of the creld2-alg <dig> gene pair within the mouse, rat and human genes
next we analyzed the intergenic sequences of the creld2-alg <dig> gene pair within the mouse, rat and human genes. as shown in figure  <dig>  the nucleotide sequence of the mouse gene pair is highly homologous to that of the rat gene pair. the proximal promoter regions of the human and mouse creld <dig> genes, especially around the erse motif, are also well conserved. we then measured the basal promoter activities of the mouse creld2-alg <dig> gene pair by using luciferase reporter constructs inserted with either the entire intergenic region  or the intergenic region containing various deletion mutations in either direction. as shown in figure 3a, reporter constructs containing the entire intergenic region in either direction  showed the higher basal promoter activity. the activity of alg <dig> promoter  is still high in the absence of the erse motif, however a further deletion from position - <dig> to - <dig> in this promoter remarkably decreased its basal activity in neuro2a cells. furthermore, a deletion from position - <dig> to - <dig> in the creld <dig> promoter dramatically decreased creld <dig> promoter activity even though the erse motif is present. the deletion of a region around the erse motif  further decreased the promoter activity.

the role of the erse motif in creld <dig> and alg <dig> promoter activities under er stress condition
as shown in figure 3b, the mouse creld <dig> promoter containing the proximal region , but no deletion mutation construct of mouse alg <dig> promoter, was significantly activated by tg-treatment. consistent with our previous report, the creld <dig> promoter construct containing the longer intergenic region  showed higher basal promoter activity but a lower responsiveness to tg compared to the above-mentioned construct  . the creld <dig> promoter without the erse motif  had an even further diminished basal promoter activity and tg- responsiveness. next, we determined the effect of various mutations within the erse motif on the activity of the mouse alg <dig> promoter. unlike the creld <dig> promoter  and its point mutation constructs , the mutations in the alg <dig> promoter  did not affect the basal promoter activity and the responsiveness to tg . then, we evaluated the effect of the erse motif's direction on the responsiveness of the mouse creld2-alg <dig> gene pair to tg by using a pgl <dig> vector containing the sv40-promoter. the reporter constructs containing a partial intergenic region of the gene pair  in either direction responded to tg and atf6-overexpression similarly . interestingly, tg-treatment and atf6-overexpression stimulated the luciferase activity of the creld <dig> promoter  construct more effectively than the alg <dig> promoter  construct .

to study the unresponsiveness of the alg <dig> promoter  to tg, we prepared another reporter construct in which the middle intergenic region of the alg <dig> promoter  that contributes to the basal promoter activity is deleted . this construct , however, did not respond to tg . serial deletions of the 3'-end of the alg <dig> promoter lacking the middle intergenic region revealed that there is a suppressive site from position - <dig> to - <dig> in the alg <dig> promoter . deletion around three putative ets family binding sites   <cit>  from position - <dig> to - <dig>  in the alg <dig> promoter  also restored responsiveness to tg. yet, this same site iii deletion in the alg <dig> promoter containing the middle intergenic region  showed unresponsiveness to tg . to determine if there are other suppressive sites in this intergenic region, we prepared various deletion mutation constructs of the alg <dig> promoter and evaluated their responsiveness to tg. as shown in figure 7a, we identified two additional suppressive sites . we also found that the deletion of all three sites  was required in order to restore the responsiveness to tg. a mutation in either the nf-y binding site  of the erse motif  or a site 8-bp downstream of the erse motif  in the alg <dig> promoter showed that each nf-y binding site partially participated in its basal promoter activity. only the site in the erse motif in the alg <dig> promoter , however, are crucial to the responsiveness to tg as well as the creld <dig> promoter  . finally, we measured the promoter activity of the entire intergenic region of the creld2-alg <dig> gene pair in the both direction  after tg treatment or atf <dig> cotransfection. both promoter constructs only slightly responded to tg, but the deletion of the three suppressive regions  restored responsiveness to tg. furthermore, the basal promoter activities of these mutant constructs markedly decreased . atf6-overexpression enhanced the promoter activity of all of the above-mentioned constructs. the tg-responsive reporter constructs  also showed a further increase in their promoter activities by atf6-overexpression .

discussion
recently, we identified creld <dig> as a novel er-stress inducible gene and characterized its atf6-dependent transcriptional regulation using constructs containing the proximal region of the mouse creld <dig> promoter  <cit> . genomic analyses reveal that the alg <dig> gene  <cit>  is adjacent to the creld <dig> gene in a head-to-head configuration on the chromosome in some species. creld <dig> and alg <dig> genes are a bidirectional gene pair arranged less than  <dig> bp apart. the nucleotide sequences of this intergenic region are moderately conserved among the mouse, rat and human genes. furthermore, those regions around an erse motif in the creld2-alg <dig> gene pair are highly conserved . in this study, we demonstrate that the expression of creld <dig> and alg <dig> mrnas, and grp <dig> and gadd <dig> mrnas, which are well known er stress-inducible genes, was induced by three distinct er stress inducers . in regards to the promoter activity of the mouse creld2-alg <dig> gene pair, only the creld <dig> promoter containing just the proximal region  significantly responded to tg. additionally, the creld <dig> promoter containing the full intergenic region  decreased in responsiveness to tg, whereas its basal promoter activity markedly increased. in contrast, the alg <dig> promoters only slightly responded to tg even though some of the reporters contained the erse motif, which is 300-bp apart from the transcription start site of the mouse alg <dig> gene. the direction of the erse motif and its distance from each of the transcription start sites for the mouse creld <dig> or alg <dig> genes, however, appear to have no influence in these findings. therefore, it seems that the full intergenic region contains one or more unknown suppressive sites that interfere with the erse-mediating enhancement of the alg <dig> and creld <dig> promoter activities.

reporter constructs used in this study contain 5'-untranslated regions  of creld <dig> and/or alg <dig> gene. especially, reporter constructs containing the entire intergenic region of creld <dig> - alg <dig> gene pair contain the utr regions at both ends. however, the deletion of three suppressive sites  in each construct recovered the responsiveness to tg . therefore, it seems likely that each 5'-utr hardly influenced the corresponding promoter activity of the creld <dig> and alg <dig> promoter constructs in our assay system. creld <dig>  and alg <dig>  genes possess 5'-utr  and 3'-utr  respectively though their effects on transcription are not elucidated yet. further characterization of these regions would reveal regulations of creld <dig> and alg <dig> mrna expression.

using various deletion mutation constructs, we showed that three suppressive sites in the creld2-alg <dig> gene pair play a crucial role in interfering with tg responsiveness. interestingly, the deletion of all three of these suppressive sites was required in order to restore the responsiveness to tg . these results imply that these suppressive sites are not only important in maintaining basal promoter activity, but that they synergistically counteract the erse-mediated transcriptional activity . among these sites, the most proximal to the alg <dig> promoter contains a conserved response element that ets-family transcriptional factors recognize  <cit> . ets transcription factors consist of approximately  <dig> family members and share a highly conserved dna-binding domain. it has been reported that these factors are involved in regulating a variety of biological processes including development, differentiation and inflammation  <cit> . in the site ii, there are putative yy1-   <cit>  and maz-   <cit>  binding sites judged from some databases such as swissregulon , but the precise roles remain to be determined. on the contrary, we are unable to find any unique sequences in the sites i. further studies characterizing each of these suppressive sites  are required in order to understand the complex transcriptional regulation of the creld2-alg <dig> gene pair. jones pl et al. reported that murine manganese superoxide dismutase gene is regulated through a complex intronic enhancer involving c/ebp-β and nf-κb  <cit> . donati g et al. demonstrated that er stress triggers dynamic modification of chromatin components and transcriptional factors under er stress  <cit> . therefore, we should focus on other aspects such as local chromatin remodeling and histone modifications  within the creld <dig> and alg <dig> genes in addition to the 5'-flanking sequences in this intergenic region. furthermore, other approaches should be employed to elucidate the discrepancy between the expression levels of both intrinsic mrnas and the promoter activities of their full intergenic region under er stress conditions.

among the bidirectional gene pairs characterized in mammalian cells, surf1-surf <dig>  <cit> , reql4-lrrc <dig>  <cit> , pdcd10-serpini <dig>  <cit>  and thox-duoxa  <cit>  gene pairs seem to share their intergenic region equally because mutations in the transcription factor binding sites decline those promoter activities equally. in contrast, the transcriptional regulations of c2orf34-prepl  <cit> , sarsm-mrps <dig>  <cit>  and hand2-dein  <cit>  are asymmetric. according to the present study, the transcriptional regulatory pattern of the mouse creld2-alg <dig> gene pair belongs to the latter group. analyses of these bidirectional gene pair sharing a common intergenic region have mostly consisted of characterization without any stimuli. recently, zanotto e et al. reported that the sarsm-mrps <dig> promoter activity is modulated by mitochondrial stresses, especially mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, in a complex manner  <cit> . at this time, however, the significance and relevance of many bidirectional gene pairs under pathophysiological conditions are not well understood.

the mammalian alg <dig> gene is the ortholog of the yeast gene that encodes the dolichyl-p-man:man7glcnac2-pp-dolichyl α6-mannosyltransferase, and its mutation causes a congenital disorder affecting glycosylation in the er  <cit> . clinically, a child suffering from a point mutation in the alg <dig> gene has been reported to show severe symptoms such as psychomotor retardation, hypotonia, growth retardation, dysmorphic features and anoxia  <cit> . sequential protein glycosylation in the er is important in maintaining the quality control of glycoproteins through folding and er-associated protein degradation. moreover, its defects could also interfere with the intracellular trafficking and secretion of glycoproteins. therefore, suitable regulation of the alg <dig> gene should be required in order to maintain er homeostasis.

as the creld proteins have multiple egf-like domains, they are considered to be cell adhesion molecules  <cit> . it has been reported that missense mutations in the creld <dig> gene increases an individual's susceptibility to atrioventricular septal defects  <cit> , but the physiological roles of these family members remain poorly understood. in contrast to creld <dig>  creld <dig> lacks a transmembrane domain in the c-terminal region. ortiz et al. reported that the overexpression of creld <dig> impairs the membrane transport of acetylcholine receptor α4/β <dig> in xenopus laevis oocytes  <cit> . we recently demonstrated that the creld <dig> gene is one of the downstream targets of atf <dig> and that its product is predominantly localized in the er-golgi apparatus  <cit> . interestingly, the mouse model for multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, which specifically expresses a mutation in matrilin- <dig>  was reported to induce creld <dig> mrna expression and other er-stress inducible genes as the symptoms progressed  <cit> . according to these reports, creld <dig> seems to be involved in the folding, processing and transport of some proteins under pathophysiological conditions, though the precise role of creld <dig> remains to be determined. furthermore, we believe that the sharing of the erse motif in the creld2-alg <dig> gene pair may be advantageous in regulating er homeostasis under various er-stress conditions, even though it is unlikely that the creld <dig> and alg <dig> proteins function by directly interacting with each other.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we first demonstrate that both the creld <dig> and alg <dig> genes, which form a bidirectional gene pair, are potent er stress-inducible genes. our present results indicate that the creld2-alg <dig> gene pair could be asymmetrically regulated by multiple transcriptional factors in addition to atf <dig>  because the creld2-alg <dig> gene pair contains an evolutionally conserved erse motif, the cooperative induction of these genes may play important roles in confronting er stresses and in appropriately regulating er homeostasis and cell fates, together with other er stress-inducible genes . therefore, further characterization of the creld2-alg <dig> gene pair may provide new insights into the complex transcriptional regulation of er stress-inducible genes as well as into the onset and progression of various er stress-associated diseases.
