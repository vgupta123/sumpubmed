BACKGROUND
major histocompatibility complex  class ii molecules are important components of the immune system and play a critical role in processes such as phagocytosis. antigenic peptide binding by these molecules is a pre-requisite for triggering immune responses. the diversity in antigen recognition is achieved through hundreds of class ii alleles labelled by their serotypes, each differing from the others in terms of the residues at the binding site and their precise three dimensional arrangement.

the nature of binding site of an mhc class ii molecule  has an important bearing on the immune system of an individual  <cit> . mhc class ii molecules provide important clues in understanding autoimmune diseases  and susceptibility to pathogens. in the context of tuberculosis, it has been reported that different mhc alleles bind peptides from mycobacterium tuberculosis with different specificities, influencing an individual's susceptibility to infection  <cit> .

a thorough knowledge of the structure of the binding site is useful in designing or identifying peptide antigens for rational vaccine design. in addition, knowledge of similar or dissimilar sites aid in understanding peptide specificities. while a general appreciation of the differences between a pair of structures can be obtained through interactive molecular graphics software tools, a thorough characterization of the differences and their mapping to individual residues in the corresponding structures, and more importantly obtaining a quantitative perspective of the extent of similarities, necessarily requires a systematic method for their analysis.

we have recently reported a new algorithm pocketmatch  <cit>  based on alignment of sorted distance elements binned into point-type-pair bins. an important step that precedes pocket comparison is the definition of the binding site itself. in the previous study, all residues  that were present in a  <dig> Å zone around any atom of the ligand were taken to constitute the site. this approach though common, is rather simplistic and more detailed methods to define the binding site need to be explored to have more accurate site definitions. here we incorporate a new module for defining binding sites and apply it for a large scale comparison of binding sites in the mhc class ii molecules.

the modified algorithm is referred to as pocketmatch <dig> hereafter. further, we show that our algorithm is useful for classification of mhc class ii molecules based on binding site analysis. the algorithm captures the overall shape, detailed geometry and the chemistry at the binding sites. this analysis also aids in understanding peptide preferences by different alleles which may become the first step in the optimal design of allele specific antigens.

RESULTS
we report a new approach for a large scale comparison of binding sites in protein structures and apply it for comparing and classifying a set of  <dig> mhc class ii molecules. the method, which utilizes structural features of the whole site as well as of the sub-pockets, also serves as a high resolution framework to systematically understand similarities and differences among alleles. we have used this to identify automatically intra- and inter-allelic variations in the binding grooves of molecules in the data set, and to explore the structural basis for correlations with disease.

inter-allelic variations
to investigate similarities across mhc molecules of different types, one mhc molecule was selected from each of the  <dig> protein data bank  entries in the dataset, and all-against-all comparisons were carried out on this set of  <dig> molecules . binding site similarity scores  were computed for all the pairs of molecules both at the level of whole groove and sub-pocket levels. cladograms were generated to show similarities and differences in pm13scores across the dataset, both at the level of the whole groove, and at the level of the five sub-pockets . in addition to considering whole binding groove, it is important to know how the similarities of the sub-pockets  vary as these are the ones that determine peptide specificity.

some mhc molecules of the same type are in different branches of the cladogram calculated for the whole groove, however clustering at the sub-pocket level was more in line with the different mhc molecule types, particularly for the p <dig> sub-pocket. this suggests that the p <dig> sub-pocket is more structurally conserved within an allele, but difference occurs across alleles. the importance of the p <dig> sub-pocket has been noted in many studies .

some different mhc molecules are grouped together in the same branch in some of the sub-pocket trees. in these cases, the pm13scores highlight similarities that would otherwise be difficult to spot in a large dataset. these can be followed up by looking for independent observations about these similarities that have been reported in the literature. the matching alleles, corresponding pdb codes and pm13scores for pairs of sub-pockets are listed in , where the significance of the grouping of different alleles is discussed and supporting references are presented.

                              score
to analyze the net distribution of similarity scores with respect to each other for each of the five sub-pockets, a histogram is plotted for various bins of pm13scores . each bin corresponds to a range of pm13scores. for example, bin- <dig> corresponds to a pm13score range of [ <dig>  to  <dig> ); bin- <dig> to the range [ <dig>  to  <dig> ) and so on. the histogram shows that p <dig> and p <dig> score highly at bin  <dig>  corresponding to [ <dig>  to  <dig> ) of pm13score. the histogram gives an indication of the overall distribution of scores for each sub-pocket viewed in the context of others. this could possibly mean over-representation of data or true conservation of these two sub-pockets.

this analysis has implications for understanding subtle differences that otherwise go undetected and aid in understanding antigen recognition preferences by different alleles and range of antigens recognized by a given allele.

intra-allelic variations
some mhc molecules are present more than once in the pdb entries in the dataset . in these cases, pocketmatch <dig> can be used to highlight differences in the peptide binding sites in different structures for the same allele.

the sites are first compared by considering the whole binding grooves. in many cases, as expected, pm13scores are high, indicating strong similarities in the binding sites of a given allele. however, there are cases where pm13scores are low for different structures of the same molecule, for example different structures of dr <dig> and dr <dig> give similarity scores as low as  <dig>  . these differences can be explored by examining the individual sub-pockets within the binding grooves . while many pairs of corresponding sub-pockets score highly, indicating similarity in the structures of the sub-pockets, in some cases the scores are significantly lower. this can be due to differences in mhc side chain conformations giving rise to different sets of intra-site distances, or can be due to determination of which mhc atoms are accessible to a probe sphere and are thus included in sub-pocket calculations. sub-pockets highlighted by pocketmatch <dig> to be dissimilar can then be examined in detail to identify the reason for the low pm13scores. some examples of sub-pockets with low pm <dig> scores are illustrated in figure  <dig> 

a pair of molecules belonging to dr <dig> exhibited low scores  in their p <dig> sub-pockets. upon careful examination, we noticed that the p <dig> sub-pocket in 1dlh was wider and deeper with many more mhc atoms being included in the pocketmatch <dig> definition of the p <dig> sub-pocket. considering the set of dra*0101-drb1* <dig> structures, the largest difference is between the p <dig> pockets of  and  . the peptide residue at the p <dig> position is oriented very differently in these two structures -- in , an isoleucine is oriented away from the groove, whereas in  a leucine is oriented "across" the top of the groove. since the p <dig> peptide residue in  obstructs the p <dig> sub-pocket more than the p <dig> peptide residue in , this affects the set of mhc atoms that are selected for the sub-pocket comparison calculation, and thus reduces the pm13score .

the two independent molecules in the crystal structure of dq <dig>  differ from each other at the p <dig> sub-pocket ; the difference between the two molecules at the p <dig> position is noted by  <cit> . this analysis indicates that pocketmatch <dig> is sufficiently sensitive to capture subtle differences that exist among molecules belonging to the same allele.

correlation with disease: case studies
several mhc class ii alleles are known to be either positively or negatively associated with certain diseases, and this motivates studies to identify the reasons for disease susceptibility in terms of three-dimensional molecular structure  <cit> . for example, jones et al.  <cit>  review the structures of alleles that are known to be positively or negatively associated with various diseases, including narcolepsy and rheumatoid arthritis . we have used pocketmatch <dig> to examine the binding grooves of alleles discussed by jones et al.  <cit>  in connection with narcolepsy and ra, using experimentally determined structures from the pdb where these are available, and model structures when they are not . in case of narcolepsy, the pockets of the binding groove in the experimentally determined structure of hla-dq <dig>   , were compared to those in a model structure of hla-dq <dig>  . these molecules differ at only a few positions in the β chain. pocketmatch <dig> identified the p <dig> sub-pocket corresponding to the thr <dig> residue of the peptide to be the most dissimilar between these two structures . the residues ala13bβ and tyr26β in hla-dq <dig>  changed to gly13β and leu26β in hla-dq <dig>  in the neighbourhood of peptide residue thr <dig>  corresponding to p <dig> ; this difference is captured by the pocketmatch <dig> algorithm.

in case of ra, alleles hla-dr <dig> , hla-dr <dig>  and hla-dr <dig> are positively associated with the disease, while hla-dr <dig>  is neutral or negative  <cit> . the α chains of these four mhc molecules are the same , and sequence comparison of the β chains with clustalw  <cit>  gives sequence identities of -- dr <dig> :dr <dig>  = 95%, dr <dig> :dr <dig>  = 97%, dr <dig> :dr <dig> = 88%, dr <dig> :dr <dig>  = 96%, dr <dig> :dr <dig> = 85%, dr <dig> :dr <dig> = 88%. given that the whole sequence similarities are not sensitive enough to capture differences at the binding site levels, we use pocketmatch <dig> to compare the binding grooves and sub-pockets of the experimentally determined structures of hla-dr <dig>   and hla-dr <dig> , and model structures of hla-dr <dig>  and hla-dr <dig> .

pocketmatch <dig> gives low scores for the p <dig> sub-pocket . it has been shown by hammer and co-workers  <cit>  that the difference in residues  <dig> and  <dig> in the β chain of the dr <dig>  and dr <dig>  mhcs accounts for the difference in binding specificity of the peptides. the low p <dig> scores are in line with that study. the superposition of these two alleles is shown in figure 5b. the p <dig> peptide residue has gln70β and lys71β present in hla-dr <dig>  within  <dig>  Å of the residue whereas an asp at the position 70β and only glu71β are present in the case of the model built for hla-dr <dig> .

all-against-all pm13scores are presented in table 4b, c. the scores indicate low pm13score of  to others in the p <dig> region of the binding site. work by rosloniec and co-workers found that mutation of the residue at the p <dig> position to an alanine has affected t cell stimulation more with dr <dig> than with dr <dig>  <cit> . the involvement of p <dig> sub-pocket in peptide recognition specificity is also discussed in  <cit> . in carrying out these case studies, model structures have been a useful supplement to the set of experimentally determined mhc class ii molecules. we envisage future studies that make use of larger sets of model structures where the binding grooves have been modelled consistently using the same protocol  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
a strategy for automatically comparing mhc class ii binding grooves and sub-pockets based on their chemical nature and geometry is presented. comparisons are facilitated by a pre-processing step in which mhc-peptide complexes are extracted from pdb files, and chains and structurally equivalent residue positions are relabelled consistently. pocket similarity scores calculated by pocketmatch <dig> can be used as the basis for clustering pockets based on their structural and chemical characteristics.

the framework we report can be used to carry out large scale comparison of binding grooves and sub-pockets, both to highlight differences in the binding grooves of mhc molecules of the same kind, and to identify similarities in the binding grooves of different mhc alleles. investigations of mhc alleles associated with narcolepsy and rheumatoid arthritis demonstrate that binding grooves of alleles that are positively associated with an autoimmune disease can be compared with those that are known to be negatively associated with the disease. the structural variations among binding pockets identified by pocketmatch <dig> corroborate known disease associations. future applications of this systematic framework for understanding structural variations in mhc class ii molecules could have direct implications towards predicting epitopes and understanding peptide binding preferences.
