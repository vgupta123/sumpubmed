BACKGROUND
mirnas are endogenous ~22-nt noncoding rnas that impact molecular mechanisms through the regulation of mrna post-transcription and/or translation  <cit> . regulation of gene expression by mirnas requires direct interaction between the mature mirna and, most often, the 3’ untranslated region of target mrnas. changes in the expression pattern of a mirna can expose novel sets of genes to its regulatory influence  <cit> . the great current interest in mirnas reflects their implication in diverse developmental processes and in the pathogenesis of cancer, cardiac, immune-related, pulmonary and other diseases  <cit> . moreover, they are more stable, even outside a cell, compared to other long rna molecules as they are either packed into microparticles, or protected by associated rna-binding proteins  or lipoprotein complexes, which protect them from the rnases activity  <cit> . therefore, circulating mirnas can be present in serum and other body fluids during the pathogenesis of many disorders  <cit> . circulating and whole blood mirnas  profiles are thus of particular interest as promising non-invasive disease biomarkers .

over  <dig> mirnas have been identified in the equine genome with distinct subsets of mirnas differentially expressed in a tissue-specific manner  <cit> . for example, horse specific mirna in cartilage and bone have been already reported  <cit>  and the existence of hundreds of horse specific transcripts may suggest the existence of more horse specific mirnas  <cit> . due to their strong sequence conservation, a majority of equine mature mirnas have been perfectly matched to human mirnas  <cit> . the fact that many human mirnas have been associated with human diseases indicates the potential of investigating mirna profiles in equine pathologic conditions. however, the number of mirnas studied and annotated in the equine genome is still much lower  compared to human  or mouse  genomes, according to mirbase v. <dig>  <cit> . moreover, some mirna may be expressed in a breed-specific manner  <cit> .

current technology, i.e. small rna sequencing , is able to provide a comprehensive study to determine the precise extend of mirna profiles in horse. taking into account the specific biogenesis of mirna it is possible to distinguish short sequences that may be derived from degraded mrna and not from true mirna sequences  <cit> . the secondary structure of pre-mature mirna resembles a hairpin, which is then processed by the endonuclease dicer to form mirna duplexes. mirnas in either the 5’ or 3’ end of their precursors are loaded into an rna-induced silencing complex, which yields functional mirnas. the loop and star sequences are usually degraded and therefore the highest coverage of the reads is expected within the mature mirna region  <cit> .

in this study we used combined high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics methods to identify equine genome mirnas. mirna profiles were thoroughly analysed by combining small rna sequencing for multiple tissues to search for novel equine circulating and tissue-specific mirnas. we prepared a total of  <dig> srna-seq libraries from six solid tissues, blood and serum from equine samples. two different algorithms were applied to support the authenticity of the identified mirnas: mirdeep <dig>  <cit>  and the more stringent, mirdentify  <cit> . given the mirna’s fundamental role in transcriptional and translational regulation in different pathologies, we compared the expression profile of mirna derived from gluteus medius  muscle of healthy horses and horses affected with polysaccharide storage myopathy type i . we also hypothesized that the identification of differences in the serum mirna expression profile between warmbloods and ponies could reveal unique biomarkers of equine breeds.

RESULTS
small rna sequencing and mapping
we obtained small rnas reads derived from  <dig>  and  <dig>  libraries. solid samples were prepared from platysma, masseter and gluteus medius muscles, heart, liver, cartilage, bone and blood of  <dig> horses. mirna from the platysma and masseter muscles, heart and liver were extracted from  <dig> healthy horses of different ages and breeds . the hiseq samples included serum rna samples from  <dig> warmbloods horses and five ponies . more details are given in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

after quality filtering for low quality reads and trimming for adaptors sequences , hiseq data from serum consisted of a total of 12 m reads on average with mean per sequence quality of  <dig> in the phred scale  <cit>  per library. in these libraries, the size distribution followed the rna length distribution reported in other equine and bovine serum samples  <cit> , with the majority of the reads  falling into piwi-interacting rna region  and with a smaller peak  in the mature mirna region . on the other hand, after removal of low-quality reads, the flanking linker and primer sequences, solid data comprised 8 m reads on average with mean per sequence quality of  <dig> in the phred scale per library. the reads longer than 30 nt were filtered out to exclude short fragments potentially derived from degraded cellular mrna  and finally the majority of the reads  were 21–23 nt long.

all remaining small rnas from hiseq and solid data  were aligned to the equus caballus reference genome  with bowtie  <cit> . overall, 91 % of reads were mapped, but 336 m  were filtered out due to multiple mapping . after collapsing reads that had identical sequence ,  <dig>  unique sequences were obtained per library on average . only  <dig>  % of reads mapped to exonic regions of the protein-coding genes , 38 % mapped to 5’ untranslated regions , and 18 % mapped to introns . the fraction of reads mapped to repeat elements, rrnas, trnas, other noncoding rna and repeated-related regions ranged from  <dig> – <dig>  %.fig.  <dig> workflow of the mirna discovery analysis. the steps taken for the identification of  <dig> novel equine mirnas from a total of  <dig> srna-seq libraries

novel equine mirna discovery
two complementary algorithms were used to identify mirnas in equine tissues: i) mirdeep2; and ii) mirdentify. briefly, we used equine known mature and hairpin structure and human mature sequences as guidance ; and minimum mirdeep score of  <dig> . among  <dig> known equine mirnas expressed in our dataset , from  <dig> to  <dig> were expressed per library ). the number of known mirnas per library identified by mirdentify ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> . a total of  <dig>  regions in the equine genome expressed in the dataset met the mirdeep <dig> criteria and thus were considered as novel candidate mirnas by mirdeep <dig>  whereas only seven met the criteria of mirdentify. more than half of the novel mirnas predicted by mirdeep <dig>  and three mirnas predicted by mirdentify were identified only in a single library and were thus filtered out . the remaining  <dig>  novel mirnas were scored from  <dig> to  <dig>  . the four novel mirnas identified by mirdentify partially overlapped with known mirnas: the ecaub_novel-mir- <dig> was only two nucleotides shorter than eca-mir- <dig>  ecaub_novel-mir- <dig> overlapped the position of an ensembl predicted ensecag <dig>  whereas the ecaub_novel-mir- <dig> was identified on the opposite strand of the eca-mir- <dig>  and ecaub_novel-mir- <dig> was located in the region of another ensembl predicted ensecag <dig>  none of the final set of the novel mirnas identified by mirdentify was simultaneously identified by mirdeep <dig>  the range of novel mature sequences length was 19–25 nt with an average and median at 22 nt. an example of a novel mirna secondary structure with expression across tissues is shown in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> an example of novel mirna structure and expression across tissues. the secondary structure of ecaub_novel-mir- <dig> predicted with rnafold in a graphical  and vienna format . the mature mirna sequence is indicated in red. boxplots represent the expression levels of ecaub_novel-mir- <dig> across the  <dig> tissues studied 




when novel mirnas were added to known mirna set, the number of clustered mirna  increased from  <dig> to  <dig>  from which  <dig> could be identified among novel mirnas separately.

equine mirna expression
for the known and discovered putative mirnas, we investigated their expression levels in the small rna libraries. a total of  <dig>  unique combination of mature and hairpin sequences were expressed in our dataset . the mean expression of trimmed means of m values  of known  and novel mirnas ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  count per million , with an average of  <dig>  cpm per mirna. we then removed lowly expressed mirnas , as they seem to play minor roles in gene expression regulation . we detected  <dig> distinct mature mirnas  expressed from  <dig> unique hairpin sequences  by combining the results from the two approaches. in total, there were  <dig>  unique combinations  with variable expression levels  in at least one small rna library. among the  <dig> mature mirnas, we observed that mir- <dig> was the most abundant, together with a putative novel mirna identified in the opposite strand of mir- <dig>  which was given here an identifier name ecaub_mir_ <dig>  these two mirnas were highly expressed in serum and blood samples compared to other tissues  =  <dig> e- <dig> and  <dig> e- <dig>  respectively; additional file 3: table s2). the highest number of novel mirnas was identified on chromosome  <dig>  and only five novel mirna were identified on chromosome  <dig> . among the  <dig> novel mirnas,  <dig>  were transcribed from the sense  strand of the dna . after removal of the lowly expressed mirnas, the length of the final set of novel mature mirnas ranged from  <dig> to 25 nt with median at 22 nt.fig.  <dig> novel mirna distribution across chromosomes. the number of novel mirna identified per chromosome. unplaced scaffolds are shown as one chromosome “unplaced”




tissue/breed specific mirnas
mirnas expression patterns differ for specific tissues differentiation states and health status. multi-dimensional scaling mds showed that samples clustered according to the tissue , rather than by individual, thus prefiguring a relevant scenario to draw tissue-specific mirna expression profiles  <cit> .fig.  <dig> multi-dimensional scaling plot of the rna samples sequenced. the distances correspond to leading average  of the largest absolute log-fold-changes between each pair of samples  <cit> 




mirnas expressed at moderate to high level  in 90 % of libraries from the same tissue or breed  were considered as expressed in the particular group . from here on, we will refer to mirnas expressed in only one group as tissue/breed specific mirnas. subsequently, we further explored mirnas exhibiting differential expression between all muscle tissues together, blood and serum together, liver, bone and cartilage. the  <dig> mirnas  expressed at > 10 cpm on average in at least one tissue presented different expression distribution: almost half of the mirnas were expressed only in one tissue , 4 %  to 11 %  were expressed in a single tissue, and about 19 % in all the tissues: muscles, liver, cartilage, bone, and circulating  . the number of tissue-specific mirnas discovered was similar and ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  as shown in fig. 6a.fig.  <dig> tissue and serum breed-specific mature mirna. the venn diagrams show the number of known mature mirnas  and novel mirnas  moderately or highly expressed  in each condition: a tissue; b muscles; c circulating components; d breed 




among muscles, the heart muscle had the highest number of specific mirnas  . only  <dig> mirnas were expressed in all the tissues at the level of > 10 cpm on average and among those only  <dig> were novel mirnas. the group specific mirnas expressed at >100 cpm on average are listed in table  <dig>  as depicted in the fig.  <dig>  the mds plot revealed mirna expression dissimilarity between healthy gm and pssm gm. more precisely, we identified five mirnas expressed at the level > 10 cpm solely in pssm gm muscle: eca-mir- <dig>  eca-mir-20b, ecaub_novel-mir- <dig>  ecaub_novel-mir- <dig>  and ecaub_novel-mir- <dig>  the mir- <dig> was also expressed at >10 cpm level in bone and eca-mir-20b in bone and liver . however, none of the mirnas was significantly up- or down-regulated in pssm compared to healthy gm even at fdr <  <dig> .table  <dig> tissue-specific mirnas and their mean expression

close to one third  of the mirnas expressed in blood were also expressed in serum, whereas  <dig> mirnas could be detected only in serum . most of these serum-specific mirnas were expressed in both breeds , although we identified two mirnas expressed solely in warmblood  and  <dig> other solely in ponies . interestingly, among these serum-specific mirnas expressed solely in ponies was eca-mir- <dig> that was expressed at >100 cpm on average .

differentially expressed serum mirnas
mirnas that showed strong specificity between equus caballus subspecies were determined by comparing the expression between horse and pony serum. age and sex did not have effect on the mirna expression profile, with no significantly differentially expressed mirnas , apart from one mirna  that passed the lower significance threshold usually suggested for demirs  =  <dig> ; fdr =  <dig> ). the absorbance at 414 nm had a significant effect on the expression of eca-mir- <dig>  and eca-mir-486-5p  that was previously reported as haemolysis dependant  <cit> . we identified  <dig> differentially expressed  mirnas  between pony and warmblood serum at a stringent significance threshold fdr <  <dig> . more than half of them  were upregulated in ponies , including  <dig> novel mirnas . the remaining  <dig> mirnas were down-regulated , including  <dig> novel mirnas . the most significant up-  and down-regulated  mirnas in ponies related to warmblood are shown on fig. 7a-b.fig.  <dig> significantly differentially expressed mirna in the serum of ponies. normalized expression levels of the most up-  and down-regulated  mirna in pony compared to warmblood serum as well as eca-mir-200a  that is downregulated by hmga2




we next selected a total of  <dig> target-genes of eca-mir- <dig> using targetscan  <cit>  and performed gene set enrichment analysis with genecodis  <cit>  to assess their biological role. the only significant kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathway  <cit>  was glycolysis/gluconeogenesis , which encompassed four target genes: pyruvate kinase, muscle , glucose-6-phosphatase, catalytic subunit , dihydrolipoamide s-acetyltransferase , and aldolase a, fructose-bisphosphate .

the downregulated eca-mir- <dig> had  <dig> potential target genes reported by targetscan and these genes significantly enriched five kegg pathways, from which the most significant was the regulation of actin cytoskeleton  with seven genes: fibroblast growth factor  <dig>  and  <dig> , p <dig> protein -activated kinase  <dig> , integrin alpha  <dig>  , v-rck sarcoma virus ct <dig> oncogene homolog  , was protein family member  <dig> , and fyve, rhogef and ph domain containing  <dig> . the other significant pathways were: pathways in cancer ; adherens junction ; renal cell carcinoma ; and wnt signalling pathway .

discussion
despite high sequence conservation much less is known about equine mirnome compared to human or murine. therefore, in this study we examined the expression of known and novel mirnas in a comprehensive list of nine horse tissues using  <dig> small rna sequencing libraries derived from  <dig> horses. the identification of novel mirnas is limited by the fact that huge fraction of small rna-seq reads is filtered out due to multiple mapping to the reference genome . these short sequences with secondary structure  are often overlapping repeat regions  <cit> .

as a gold standard has not been established in the field of mirna discovery, we decided to use two reportedly well performing tools and combine the results. while  <dig>  mirnas were identified in our study by mirdeep <dig>  only four were identified by the more stringent mirdentify. the mirdentify does not use information on other species mirna annotations and usually results in lower number of mirnas predicted  <cit> . small overlap between those two tools is known and the stringent ten parameters of mirdentify discards 50 % of human annotated mirnas  <cit> . whereas all the four mirnas identified by mirdentify partially overlapped the known or ensembl predicted mirna genes, novel mirnas identified by mirdeep <dig> often spanned unannotated regions of the horse genome.

after removing lowly expressed mirnas, our dataset consisted of  <dig> novel mirnas , from which 49 % were transcribed from the sense strand, accordingly to known equine mirnas that are annotated equally on both strands . the highest number of novel mirnas was identified on the largest chromosome one, but also  <dig> novel mirnas were identified on unplaced chromosomes . the unplaced chromosomes are often neglected, as it is the least annotated region of the horse genome. a future equcab <dig> reference genome is believed to decrease the number of unplaced scaffolds and improve the quality of the reference genome. interestingly, we identified a putative novel mirna encoded by the mitochondrial genome that has been previously described in horse  <cit> , however, the mitomir was identified only in one heart sample and was excluded from further analysis.

our study aimed to identify tissue-/serum breed-specific mirnas and our definition of such mirnas presumed that specific mirna can be expressed at low level  in other tissues but it has to be expressed at least at the level of 10 cpm in 90 % of the samples of a particular tissue/breed. this approach differs from other studies that were based on quantitative reverse transcription pcr  or microarray data, where “yes/no” approach was taken. however, we hypothesize that since mirnas can be exported and transferred between the cells, they might appear in low amounts in other tissues that they do not originate from and where they are not directed to. moreover, it has been shown that only  <dig> mirnas were expressed in moderate to high levels  in human brain and most likely the moderately/highly expressed mirna play more important role in gene expression regulation .

with our approach, we identified mirnas that were expressed in a tissue- and breed-specific manner . we identified a group of  <dig> mirnas that were universally expressed at >10 cpm in 90 % of libraries across all the tissues studied . such a feature identifies this group of mirnas as a candidate universal reference to normalize mirna expression in normal horse tissues. the expression pattern and tissues distribution of these  <dig> mirnas suggest that they might be associated with biological fundamental functions in the cell, such as metabolism. we identified  <dig> mirnas that were expressed in specific tissues with minimal or no expression in other tissues we examined, suggesting more local function of these mirnas that are not exported outside the cell. for example, eca-mir- <dig> and eca-mir-133a were highly expressed primarily in muscles and we observed very little or no expression of these mirnas in other tissues. a total of eight serum-specific mirnas  were expressed in a tissue-specific manner, although they may derive from other tissues not analysed in the present study and therefore have to be treated with caution.

the heart tissue had the most specific mirnas among all the muscles . the cardiac muscle is highly specialized tissue and is a different type compared to other skeletal muscles evaluated in this study and therefore more specific mirnas were expected to be expressed in the heart tissue  <cit> . moreover, many mirnas have been already implicated in the cardiac development and diseases  <cit> . for such as limited number of libraries per group examined, several mirnas that were previously considered as “tissue-specific” in humans were not detected in our data. for instance, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> , mir- <dig> were not detected  in the heart tissue; mir- <dig> and mir-208a were not detected in skeletal muscles; mir- <dig> in liver; or mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> in bone  <cit> .

we also noticed that only less than half of the mirnas expressed in blood  were common with serum mirnas, suggesting that remaining 67 % of mirnas is expressed in blood cells and are not exported to serum . however, we need to take into account that the serum mirna set was derived from different horse breed and some additional breed specific differences may apply as we shown for serum samples in fig. 6d.

our study also provided an opportunity to re-visit and confirm tissue-specific mirnas previously reported in horses. interestingly only five novel cartilage/bone mirnas reported in  <cit>  have been also identified in this study, however, the mature mirnas reported here were slightly longer. interestingly two of them were not expressed  in either cartilage or bone, but in blood . from five most abundantly expressed novel putative mirna reported in equine plasma by lee et al.  <cit> , only one mirna was identified in our study in bone and blood tissues with a mature sequenced shorter by three nucleotides from 5’ end. from the  <dig> novel mirnas reported by kim et al.  <cit>  only  <dig> had exactly the same mature sequence as novel mirnas reported here. from the  <dig> putative novel mirnas included in the microarrays used by mach et al.  <cit>  only two had exactly the same mature sequence and further  <dig> had few nucleotides shorter mature sequence compared to the mirnas identified here . one of the reasons of such discrepancy is the different method used for putative novel mirna identification in all of those studies. moreover, a phenomenon of multiple isoforms  derived from the same precursor is known, where a pre-mature or mature sequence of a mirna is modified by an addition, edition, or subtraction of nucleotides  <cit> . for single mirna, even a total of about  <dig> isomirs, including combinations, can exist and consequently srna-seq can show/generate a large part of these isomirs  <cit> .

consistent with literature findings, mir- <dig> and mir-133b were characterized solely in muscle, where they promote differentiation or proliferation of myoblasts  <cit> . in addition, non-muscle-specific mirna involved in myogenesis  were broadly expressed  <cit> . nonetheless, from the  <dig> tissue-specific known equine mirnas reported in liver, colon or muscles, a total of  <dig> were expressed in our study and  <dig> of them were expressed at >10 cpm on average in at least one group. interestingly,  <dig> mirnas reported as tissue-specific in kim et al.  <cit>  were also expressed in all groups studied here, at > 10 cpm on average. from the  <dig> liver-specific mirnas reported by kim et al.  <cit> , only one was supported by our study with our definition of tissue specificity . on contrary, four of liver-specific mirnas reported here were reported in kim et al.  <cit>  as muscle  or colon-specific mirnas . it was not clear to us, how the authors determined the tissue specificity and there is a clear need to establish a common standard for future reference.

several recent studies have supported the possibilities for the use of mirna signatures as biomarkers for the detection of cancer, pregnancy and other diseases such as myopathies in humans and murine models. in our study, the expression of mirnas specific for pssm-gm-were not statistically differentially expressed relative to healthy animals, which most likely was due to low number of samples and/or general low expression of these specific mirnas.

because a significant genetic diversity  and structure between horse breeds has been described  <cit> , it is tempting to speculate that this genetic variability may result in different mirna synthesis and expression that may contribute to phenotypic variation between warmblood and ponies. in fact, we identified  <dig> demirs between warmblood and pony serum samples . the most significantly demir was eca-mir- <dig>  which was highly up-regulated in ponies compared to warmbloods . this mirna, which is highly expressed in liver  <cit> , was also expressed at the highest level in the liver samples . the human mir- <dig> is involved in glucose and lipid metabolism  <cit>  and it has been proposed as a therapeutic target for metabolic diseases  <cit> . ponies are known to be among breeds more prone to develop equine metabolic syndrome   <cit>  and therefore mir- <dig> may be of particular interest for unravelling the molecular mechanism of this disease. moreover, the pony serum specific mir- <dig>  also significantly upregulated in ponies , has been shown to be upregulated in patients with adrenocortical cancer  <cit> . this may suggest that eca-mir- <dig> might potentially increase the predisposition to metabolic diseases in ponies.

moreover, it was reported that high mobility group at-hook  <dig> gene  carries a snp associated with height in shetland pony  <cit> . hmga <dig> also down-regulates the expression of mir-200b  <cit> . both mir-200a and mir-200b were significantly upregulated in pony serum in our study with log2fc > <dig>  . therefore, we can speculate that impaired hmga <dig> has decreased capability to inhibit the mir- <dig> expression in ponies.

to confirm the breed specificity of the serum mirnas more serum samples from various horse breeds are necessary to analyse in terms of their mirna profile in future. however, this study shows clear differences in mirna profiles between ponies and warmbloods.

CONCLUSIONS
our srna-seq data and analyses of expression patterns in  <dig> different tissues presented a global view of tissue distribution of known and novel mirnas and the relation to their chromosomal locations. we identified  <dig> novel equine mirnas expressed in seven solid tissues, blood and serum. additionally, our approach evidenced that such data supported identification of specific mirnas as markers of functions related to breeds or disease tissues. for instance, we showed an increased expression of circulating serum mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> in ponies together with the predicted mirna target genes that are required in the control of energy metabolism. the increased expression of eca-mir- <dig> in ponies relative to warmblood suggested an increased predisposition to metabolic diseases in ponies. lastly, we were also able to identify mirnas not exported to the serum, which most likely have local function.
