BACKGROUND
a pair of neuronal scaffolding proteins, represented in humans by caskin <dig> and caskin <dig>  participate in signaling pathways involved in axon guidance and the creation of neuromuscular junctions. while mammals possess two caskin homologs, drosophila only possesses one form  that differs in domain composition and c. elegans has no homolog at all leading to the idea that the general role of caskins may be to provide more complex signaling outcomes in higher organisms by recruiting additional sets of protein partners  <cit> . typical for many scaffolding proteins  <cit> , caskin <dig> and caskin <dig> are composed entirely of protein-protein interaction domains including six ankyrin repeats, an sh <dig> domain and tandem sam domain . the c-terminal half of the protein, spanning over  <dig> residues and only partially conserved, is characterized by a proline-rich segment of unknown function  <cit> .fig.  <dig> domain organization of caskin <dig> and structure features of its sh <dig> domain. a caskin <dig>  unlike caskin <dig>  cannot bind the cask scaffolding protein due to the absence of a cask interacting domain . the caskin sequences diverge in a proline rich , ultimately ending with a conserved c-terminal sequence of unknown significance. b sequence comparison of the caskin <dig> and caskin <dig> sh <dig> domains. black dots indicate amide resonances that could not be assigned, characteristic of intermediate  motions. secondary structure of the caskin <dig> sh <dig> domain is shown below its sequence. six amino acids constituting the canonical binding cleft are colored. c cα superposition of the ensemble of lowest energy structures submitted to the protein data bank  d among the six amino acids in a typical peptide binding cleft, position  <dig>  and position  <dig>  are non-canonical. e a survey of binding clefts from sh <dig> domains in the protein data bank that vary from the typical compliment of aliphatic and aromatic amino acids exemplified by abl . from the survey, sh <dig> domains are observed to bear substitutions at one or more of the six positions 



caskin <dig>  and caskin <dig> by homology, were named by their ability to serve as ligands of the maguk protein, cask, a prominent signaling protein linked to calcium mediated signaling events, actin microfilament assembly, and synaptic communication through the neurexin cell surface receptor  <cit> . later structural studies of caskin <dig> revealed that the cask interaction domain , shared with x11/mint and located in a region between the sh <dig> and sam domains, was not present in caskin <dig>  thus, the namesake of caskin <dig> is misleading because it is unable to bind the calmodulin kinase domain of cask  <cit> . this distinction lead us to speculate that despite their organizational similarity, caskin <dig> and caskin <dig> may have diverged with respect to their scaffolding functions in neurons  <cit> .

owing to the prominence of cask in the development of neurological disease  <cit> , research to date has concentrated on caskin <dig> . in this report, we have concentrated on the caskin <dig> sh <dig> domain to explore the question of whether functional differences between caskin <dig> and caskin <dig> extend to the structural level. building upon the nmr solution structure of the caskin <dig> sh <dig> domain, we demonstrate that the typical binding cleft has two hydrophobic amino acid substitutions that do not affect the overall fold, but do affect thermostability and the ability to interact with peptides. these observations led us to consider that the caskin <dig> sh <dig> domain was non-functional. when hydrophobic amino acids were reintroduced, thermostability increased and high affinity binding was restored towards a peptide ligand of one of caskin2’s most homologous family members.

RESULTS
domain organization and sequence similarity
the caskin <dig> and caskin <dig> sh <dig> domains are located at the same position within each protein and are approximately 60 % similar . following the sh <dig> domain, caskin <dig> and caskin <dig> diverge in sequence, the notable differences being the lack of a cask interaction domain  in caskin <dig>  as well as the length and composition of a carboxy terminal proline-rich region. thus, depending on the perspective, caskin <dig> and caskin <dig> are simultaneously similar and different, and therefore warrant some caution when making functional assumptions about one protein in the absence of knowledge from the other.

structure of the caskin <dig> sh <dig> domain
we began this study with a nmr solution structure determination of the caskin <dig> sh <dig> domain to provide a high-resolution framework for exploring how the sh <dig> domain may interact with ligands and react to post-translational modifications. backbone atom precision for the ensemble of structures was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  Å, consistent with the number of experimental observations used in the structure calculation. complete statistics pertaining to the experimental observations and structural quality are presented in table  <dig>  from the ensemble of the lowest energy structures, the rt and n-src loops presented a high degree of disorder , presumably due to the absence of a ligand. experimentally, the decrease in backbone atom precision is manifested by missing backbone assignments  and short-range noe observations . a survey of the pdb for similar structures revealed the sh <dig> domains from human kiaa <dig> and yeast nbp <dig>  along with the well characterized sh <dig> domain from stam <dig>  <cit>  .table  <dig> restraints and statistics for the ensemble of  <dig> structures

the caskin <dig> sh <dig> domain peptide binding cleft
a typical sh <dig> domain presents a binding cleft comprised of six, nearly linearly arranged, hydrophobic amino acids. as shown in fig. 1d, the six amino acids in caskin <dig> are k <dig>  i <dig>  f <dig>  p <dig>  r <dig>  and y <dig>  notably, there is strong deviation at the first and fifth positions, denoted by k <dig> and r <dig>  since the side chains of the sh <dig> domain binding cleft are surface exposed, k <dig> and r <dig> do not affect the protein fold, and presumably, this is also the case for caskin <dig>  given that the binding cleft deviates at two positions from the typical set of amino acids observed in pxxp type sh <dig> domains like abl kinase  <cit>  and rxxk type sh <dig> domains like stam <dig>  <cit> , we hypothesized that the caskin <dig> sh <dig> domain might bind an unconventional peptide ligand. to answer this question, we performed four successive rounds of panning a 6xhis−-tagged caskin <dig> sh <dig> domain against a commercial bacteriophage 12-mer peptide display library . a comparison of eight peptides from the last round of panning revealed a pxx motif in many of the candidates . however, upon testing this motif with two chemically synthesized peptides and one reversed peptide as a control, we did not observe any binding in nmr based titrations suggesting that the library may have identified a very weak interaction. since the phage display method failed to identify a ligand for the caskin <dig> sh <dig> domain, it led us to consider that the caskin <dig> sh <dig> domain might be a non-functional remnant of the protein.

figure 1e presents a comparison of high resolution sh <dig> domain structures from the protein data bank with an emphasis on representatives having peptide binding clefts that deviate from the usual complement of aliphatic and aromatic amino acids, and consequently, have no ligands reported for them. the abl sh <dig> domain leads a set of sequences in fig. 1e as a point of reference and prototype for the typical array of aromatic and aliphatic amino acids that populate the six positions of the binding cleft. next to abl in the presentation is the run/tbc <dig> domain containing protein- <dig> sh <dig> domain  that swaps an aromatic/aliphatic pair at positions  <dig> and  <dig> of the cleft with a compensatory aliphatic/aromatic pair. a survey of the remaining representatives in the figure demonstrate that it is possible for each of the six binding cleft positions to tolerate a hydrophilic or charged amino acid substitution. the crk-ii sh <dig> domain represents the most extreme case with substitutions at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  loss of ligand binding in the crk-ii sh <dig> domain in the context of the full adaptor protein is consistent with a stabilizing function rather than a regulatory function in this domain  <cit> .

substitution mutagenesis of the caskin <dig> peptide binding cleft
a caskin <dig> sh <dig> domain double mutant  that we termed sh3-2x, was expressed to reintroduce a full complement of aromatic amino acids in the peptide binding cleft. using circular dichroism  spectroscopy, the sh3-2x protein demonstrated a 20 °c increase in its thermal denaturation midpoint . this observation suggests that aromatics in these two positions contribute to the stability of the sh <dig> fold. given the high degree of structural similarity to the stam <dig> sh <dig> domain in complex with a ubpy peptide  <cit> , we introduced four more substitutions into the sh3-2x framework to produce a full mimic of the stam <dig> interaction in the caskin sh <dig> domain. overall, this new mutant termed sh3-6x, contains two substitutions to reintroduce aromatics , two minor substitutions that maintain hydrophobicity  and two substitutions in the rt-loop  that provide important complementary ionic contacts to the ubpy peptide ligand in stam <dig>  since the sh3-2x mutant was a subset of the sh3-6x mutant, the expressed protein had a similar thermal denaturation midpoint of 70 °c . when tested against a class-iii ubpy peptide containing an rxxkp motif, high affinity binding  was observed  in the same order of magnitude as another class-iii sh <dig> domain gads with an slp- <dig> peptide ligand  <cit> . as expected, the wild type caskin <dig> sh <dig> domain had an over  <dig> fold less affinity for the ubpy peptide. while ultralow affinity sh <dig> domains with biological relevance have been reported, there is no evidence to suggest if caskin <dig> is among this group  <cit> .table  <dig> thermal denaturation midpoints of caskin <dig> sh <dig> domain mutants

fig.  <dig> an sh3-6x mutant  mimics the binding cleft of the stam <dig> sh <dig> domain in a caskin <dig> sh <dig> domain framework and consequently, high affinity towards a stam <dig> ligand  derived from the protein, ubpy. from direct curve fitting against a binding equation describing a 1: <dig> protein to peptide complex, the dissociation constants  of wild type caskin <dig> sh <dig> domain and 6x mutant are 39 ± 6 μm and 220 ±  <dig> nm, respectively



CONCLUSIONS
the nmr structure of the caskin <dig> sh <dig> domain demonstrates a variant ligand binding cleft populated with charged amino acids. based on this unique feature, we hypothesized that the caskin <dig> sh <dig> domain may bind a ligand that does not belong to any of the canonical, mainly proline-rich sequences that sh <dig> domains typically bind. since a phage display failed to identify a ligand for the caskin <dig> sh <dig> domain, we concluded that it may indeed be non-functional. increased thermal stability and ligand binding could be engineered back into the caskin <dig> sh <dig> domain sequence with relatively few amino acid substitutions. this results presented in the report emphasize the considerable versatility that sh <dig> domains, and signaling adaptor proteins, in general, have at their disposal.
