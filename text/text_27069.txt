BACKGROUND
the cytoskeleton plays a key role in modulating the morphological changes of cells and tissues, impacting both the resistance to deformation and the exertion of force by the cell  <cit> . in the central nervous system, thyroid hormones are thought to act as master regulators of tissue growth and cytoskeletal development  <cit> . thyroid hormone action can be mediated through traditional genomic mechanisms such as the regulation of transcription  <cit>  in association with co-activators and co-repressors  <cit> . however, a direct transcriptional regulation of cytoskeletal elements by thyroid hormone receptors has not been described. this suggests that thyroid hormones might act indirectly by controlling intermediary signaling cascades, which could coordinate the regulatory components of cytoskeletal formation  <cit> .

the sensory epithelium of the mammalian inner ear is an excellent model system to understand basic questions of cytoskeletal organization, as structural elements, such as actin and microtubules, facilitate the organization and architecture of this tissue. the auditory epithelium of the inner ear contains one row of inner hair cells and three rows of outer hair cells , which detect and amplify sound, and several types of non-sensory supporting cells, which withstand the mechanical stress of sound vibrations. in particular, supporting pillar cells , which form the fluid-filled tunnel of corti  <cit> , have a highly organized cytoskeletal network composed primarily of microtubules  <cit> . disruptions in the formation of this tunnel have been shown to negatively impact hearing function  <cit> . therefore, it is imperative that we understand the regulatory cues that facilitate normal structural development.

there is reason to suggest that thyroid hormone signaling has an important role in development of the cochlea. both the sensory and supporting cells in this epithelium have unique expression patterns of thyroid hormone receptors  <cit> , and deiodinase enzymes  <cit> , which control the availability of thyroid hormone. more recently, thyroid hormone transporters have also been localized to this sensory epithelium  <cit> , and the developmental expression profile contributes some control over the accessibility of ligand to the cell-specific targets. consistent with this hypothesis, deletion of all known thyroid hormone receptors leads to hearing impairment and inner ear cell structural defects, including malformation of cells in the organ of corti, and a collapsed tunnel of corti  <cit> . however, the factors that mediate development of the inner ear structures are largely unknown. in the cochlea, cytoskeletal formation, including the actin-based cuticular plate in ohcs  <cit>  and the dense 15-protofilament microtubule network in pcs  <cit>  that is mostly acetylated  <cit> , follows cell differentiation  <cit> . however, the signaling pathways mediating cell structural development are not well understood.

interestingly, mutations in some components of the fibroblast growth factor  signaling pathway cause inner ear structural defects that appear similar to those of the hypothyroid phenotype. in particular, mutations in fgf receptor  <dig>  lead to disruptions in tissue structure, including a collapsed tunnel of corti, and cause auditory defects in both mice and humans  <cit> . these disruptions have been attributed to both a lack of differentiation of pcs and malformation in pc microtubule development  <cit> . however, there must also be some regulation of fgf-receptor expression. one possibility that has been observed in other organ systems is the impact of thyroid hormone regulation of the fgf-signaling pathway. for example, thyroid hormone stimulates fgfr expression in undifferentiated cartilage  <cit> . furthermore, a thyroid hormone response element is present in the promoter region of fgfr <dig>  <cit> . together, these data suggest that fgf-signaling could act as an intermediary between thyroid hormone signaling and cytoskeletal development, and motivate further examination of thyroid hormone action specifically in the cochlea.

in this study, we examined the mechanism of thyroid hormone action on inner ear structural development. we found that hypothyroidism led to higher mrna expression of fgf-receptors relative to controls, leading to a delay in the down-regulation of fgfr <dig>  hypothyroidism also led to delayed ohc and pc differentiation, which may be mediated in part by the aberrant expression of fgf-receptors. finally, hypothyroidism disrupted ohc and supporting pc structure, and aberrantly stiffened embryonic and early postnatal epithelial cells. here, we show that the hypothyroid-induced cell stiffening may be mediated in part by the disrupted phosphorylation of cofilin, which has the potential to alter actin dynamics.

RESULTS
thyroid hormone levels regulate fgfr expression in the cochlea
to determine if fgf-signaling is modulated by thyroid hormones, we examined expression of two fgf-receptors, fgfr <dig> and fgfr <dig>  in cochleae from mice with altered thyroid hormone levels. to create a hyperthyroid condition, cochlear explant cultures were established at embryonic day  <dig>  and treated with triiodothyronine  for  <dig> or  <dig> days beginning after  <dig> hours in vitro. quantitative rt-pcr  data showed a two-fold decrease in fgfr <dig> and fgfr <dig> mrna levels at both time points . as endogenous thyroid hormone depletion takes considerably longer than thyroid hormone stimulation in culture  <cit> , we used pharmacological agents to deplete thyroid hormones during development in vivo. pregnant female mice were rendered hypothyroid with a combination of methimazole in the drinking water and low iodine feed, which has previously been shown to induce hypothyroidism in the cochlea in utero <cit> . to probe for changes in fgf-receptors, mrna was extracted from inner ear sensory epithelia. results from qpcr indicated significant increases in both fgfr <dig> and fgfr <dig> mrna levels under hypothyroid conditions at both embryonic day  <dig>  and postnatal day  <dig>  . however, by postnatal day  <dig> , while fgfr <dig> expression was six-fold greater in hypothyroid conditions relative to controls, fgfr <dig> expression was not significantly different from controls . these data are consistent with negative regulation of fgfr expression by thyroid hormones within the developing inner ear.


in order to localize the increase in expression of these receptors in the cochlea, we examined fgfr mrna expression by in situ hybridization in control and hypothyroid cochleae. at p <dig>  fgfr <dig> is localized to cell populations in both the greater epithelial ridge, a collection of cells medial to the sensory epithelium that gives rise to the inner sulcus  <cit> , and the lesser epithelial ridge, which is located lateral to the sensory epithelium and gives rise to the spiral ligament  <cit>  . in hypothyroid conditions, expression of fgfr <dig> appeared more intense at p <dig> relative to controls at basal and apical regions of the cochlear duct . expansion of the expression domain of fgfr <dig> was not observed. in contrast with fgfr <dig>  fgfr <dig> is normally initially expressed broadly within the sensory epithelium in progenitors that will give rise to both hair cells and supporting cells  <cit> , but by p <dig> is down-regulated in sensory ohcs of the more mature basal region of the cochlea and maintained in non-sensory supporting pillar and deiterâ€™s cells . at later developmental time points, fgfr <dig> expression in the apex resembles expression in the base  <cit> . in hypothyroid conditions, fgfr <dig> expression in the base persisted in ohcs at p <dig>  indicating a delay in down-regulation . taken together, these results show that hypothyroidism leads to a delay in development of the inner ear, and suggest that there may also be a delay in differentiation of both ohcs and pcs at postnatal stages.

as mentioned in the introduction, both gain and loss of function mutations in fgfr <dig> lead to deafness  <cit>  and prolonged fgf-signaling delays pc development  <cit> . since hypothyroidism leads to a delay in down-regulation of fgfr <dig>  we hypothesized that there may be delays in the maturation of this epithelium. one hallmark of differentiation is the formation and stabilization of junctional complexes, which in the cochlea are composed of adherens and tight junction proteins  <cit> , including zonula-occuludens  <dig> . in particular, zo- <dig> was recently characterized in this epithelium to be associated with maturation of ohc apical structure  <cit> . therefore, we examined the downstream effect of delayed maturation on immunofluorescence intensity of labeled zo- <dig> in control and hypothyroid cochleae. hypothyroid cochleae showed decreased immunolabeling of zo- <dig> relative to control conditions and this was most apparent at e <dig> , suggesting both a delay in differentiation and disruption to cell structure. to look more specifically at supporting cell maturation, expression of neurotrophin receptor p <dig> , an early marker of developing pcs  <cit> , was examined by immunohistochemistry in cochlear cross-sections. p75ntr is initially expressed in the cochlea at embryonic stages of development  <cit> , and is down-regulated postnatally, which allows for specific labeling of early developing pcs. confocal images revealed that the onset of p75ntr expression was not delayed at e <dig> or p <dig> . in contrast, at p <dig>  p75ntr expression in the base of the cochlea, which would normally be down-regulated, persisted in hypothyroid samples , consistent with a delay in maturation of this supporting cell type. together, these results suggest that cochlear development is delayed in the late embryonic period and pc development is delayed at early postnatal time points.


to further assess postnatal pc development, expression of s100-a <dig> protein was labeled and compared between cochleae in hypothyroid and control conditions. s <dig> proteins are initially highly enriched throughout the cochlear duct at embryonic stages  <cit> , and are later down-regulated in differentiated pcs after the first postnatal week. while s100-a <dig> immunofluorescence intensity appeared to be lower in hypothyroid than in control conditions at p <dig>  by p <dig>  s100-a <dig> immunofluorescence appeared higher in hypothyroid than in control conditions , which is consistent with the developmental delay observed in hypothyroid cochleae  <cit> . to quantify this difference, measurements of relative fluorescence intensity  were calculated and compared between hypothyroid and control conditions. in pcs, s100-a <dig> intensity decreased from 987â€‰Â±â€‰ <dig> a.u. in control conditions to 319â€‰Â±â€‰ <dig> a.u. in hypothyroid conditions at p <dig>  as was the case for the ohcs . later, at p <dig>  expression of s100-a <dig> was significantly increased from 609â€‰Â±â€‰ <dig> a.u. in controls to 1257â€‰Â±â€‰ <dig> a.u. in hypothyroid conditions  showing that disruptions in these cells persist at later postnatal stages. additionally, the relative fluorescence intensity of phalloidin in hypothyroid ohcs and pcs showed about a three-fold increase relative to control conditions .

finally, to assess late postnatal differentiation of pcs, we examined the relative immunofluorescence of cd <dig>  a protein that is restricted to supporting pcs at p <dig>  increases in intensity through p <dig>  <cit>  and is reported to be responsive to changes in thyroid hormone levels in the cerebellum  <cit> . confocal micrographs of cochlear cross-sections at p <dig> showed that cd <dig> fluorescence appeared lower in hypothyroid conditions relative to controls , suggesting that pcs maintain a sensitivity to thyroid hormone levels during postnatal development that may contribute to cell maturation beyond the effects of fgfr <dig>  taken together, these data suggest that hypothyroidism leads to a delay in the timing of pc maturation, as early markers of development that are normally down-regulated persist and late markers of development are delayed under experimental conditions. additionally, the corresponding delay in down-regulation of fgfr expression also suggests that some of these early effects are mediated through prolonged fgfr expression.

hypothyroidism disrupts microtubule formation in the cochlea
previous studies found that hypothyroidism reduces the presence of tubulin in the developing central nervous system  <cit> . furthermore, we observed a delay in the pattern of s100-a <dig> expression, which has been implicated in microtubule formation in vitro <cit> . therefore we asked if hypothyroidism also had consequences for the structural development of pcs and ohcs. to examine cellular structure, transmission electron micrographs were collected from cross-sections of control and hypothyroid cochleae. at p <dig>  control pc cytoplasm contained microtubules that are oriented longitudinally from the lumenal surface to the basilar membrane . in contrast, pcs from hypothyroid cochleae contained fewer microtubules . quantitative analyses of the distribution of microtubules after controlling for differences in cell width were calculated and compared between control and hypothyroid conditions. analysis revealed a significant decrease in the mean number of microtubules  per micron cell width in pcs in hypothyroid conditions . to confirm this result, horizontal sections from the lumenal surface of the pcs were also examined and fewer microtubules were observed in hypothyroid relative to control conditions . it is of note that the majority of microtubules at the lumenal cell surface of pcs in hypothyroid conditions localized to the lateral edge of the pc, whereas there were microtubules observed throughout the cytoplasm of control pcs . as there was also a significant increase in hypothyroid ohc phalloidin immunofluorescence , we investigated whether hypothyroid conditions would also lead to structural defects in ohc development. transmission electron micrographs indicated that hypothyroid ohcs were shorter and wider in comparison to controls at p <dig> . to quantify this difference, we measured the average cell width and cell length , and found a significant increase in ohc width: length ratio in hypothyroid cochleae . overall, the data suggest that hypothyroidism leads to microtubule-based structural defects in supporting pcs and morphological defects in sensory ohcs.


in pcs, microtubules are further refined through post-translational modifications such as acetylation  <cit> , which have consequences for both microtubule stability  <cit>  and cell structure  <cit> . to investigate the effects of hypothyroidism on microtubule stability, immunohistochemistry of acetylated tubulin was performed on whole mount cochleae from control and hypothyroid conditions. confocal image analysis showed that acetylated tubulin immunofluorescence, a marker for stable microtubules  <cit> , was almost undetectable in the pc region at p <dig> in hypothyroid cochleae . this was in contrast to control cochleae, which showed strong immunolabeling of acetylated tubulin in pcs . similar results were observed by p <dig> with lowered overall fluorescence intensity levels of acetylated tubulin in hypothyroid pcs relative to control conditions . ohcs at p <dig> also contained a microtubule-based kinocilium  <cit>  that was identified by the enrichment of acetylated tubulin . however, this structure was also observed under hypothyroid conditions , suggesting that hypothyroidism does not delay formation or completely disrupt microtubules in ohcs. finally at postnatal day  <dig> , there was an absence of acetylated tubulin compared to control in hypothyroid pcs and deiterâ€™s cells , a type of supporting cell with processes that interdigitate between ohcs. these results are consistent with a decrease in pc microtubule stability in response to hypothyroid conditions at all three time-points tested.


hypothyroidism stiffens outer hair cells and supporting pillar cells
previous cell and developmental biology studies suggest that the cytoskeleton plays a role in the control of cell shape  <cit>  and, more recently, in dictating cell mechanical properties  <cit> . the decreased microtubule formation , and alterations in microtubule stability  of pcs, along with changes in morphology of ohcs  raised the question of whether mechanical properties of these cells might also be altered in hypothyroid conditions. to test this hypothesis, we measured the mechanical properties of these cells in culture with an atomic force microscope . average youngâ€™s modulus , a measure of the cellular resistance to deformation, was calculated and compared between hypothyroid and control cochleae at late embryonic and early postnatal time points. we hypothesized that decreased cell structural development would lead to a decrease in youngâ€™s modulus. however, youngâ€™s modulus of ohcs actually showed a trend towards increased stiffness in hypothyroid conditions between e <dig> and p <dig>  with this difference becoming statistically significant at p <dig> . these results suggest that hypothyroid-related changes in cell morphology stiffen ohcs.


to examine the effects of hypothyroidism on the mechanical properties of developing pcs, we also calculated average youngâ€™s modulus for pcs in control and hypothyroid conditions. we found that in controls, pc youngâ€™s modulus was approximately five-fold higher between e <dig> and p <dig> . this corresponds to increased microtubule acetylation  <cit>  and suggests that increased cytoskeletal formation leads to cell stiffening. in contrast with controls, hypothyroid pcs were significantly stiffer at e <dig> and p <dig> . however by p <dig>  hypothyroid pcs showed significantly reduced youngâ€™s modulus relative to controls . in summary, these results indicate that hypothyroidism leads to a stiffening of ohcs and pcs early in development, and that at later time points hypothyroid pcs fail to develop mature mechanical properties.

actin is responsible for the aberrant increase in pillar cell and outer hair cell stiffness
the decreased stiffness of hypothyroid pcs at p <dig> is consistent with the observed decrease in microtubules  and lack of microtubule stability . however, the hypothyroid pc stiffening at e <dig> and p <dig> and ohc stiffening at p <dig> were unexpected. one possible explanation for this effect could be the increase in filamentous actin in response to decreased thyroid hormone signaling, as observed by the increased phalloidin fluorescence intensity . if actin mediates cell mechanical properties, then disruptions to the actin cytoskeleton should lead to decreased cell stiffness in hypothyroid conditions. to test this hypothesis, cochlear explants from control and hypothyroid animals were treated with latrunculin a, a cell-permeant toxin  <cit>  that sequesters actin monomers  <cit>  and depolymerizes actin filaments  <cit> . consistent with this mechanism, cochleae treated at p <dig> with latrunculin a showed decreased phalloidin immunofluorescence . in controls, a  <dig> minute incubation with latrunculin a resulted in a significant decrease in the average youngâ€™s modulus  of ohcs from  <dig> â€‰Â±â€‰ <dig>  kpa to  <dig> â€‰Â±â€‰ <dig>  kpa, while pcs in the same samples were not significantly different after treatment . this suggests that the disruption to ohc actin and reduced ohc stiffness does not also significantly disrupt pc youngâ€™s modulus. however, pcs maintained in hypothyroid conditions and treated with latrunculin a showed a significant decrease in youngâ€™s modulus at both p <dig>  from  <dig> â€‰Â±â€‰ <dig>  kpa untreated to  <dig> â€‰Â±â€‰ <dig>  kpa after treatment, and at p <dig>  from  <dig> â€‰Â±â€‰ <dig>  kpa untreated to  <dig> â€‰Â±â€‰ <dig>  kpa after treatment . ohcs maintained in hypothyroid conditions also showed a decreased youngâ€™s modulus in response to latrunculin a administration, which is similar to results observed in euthyroid conditions. however, the magnitude of the decreased ohc youngâ€™s modulus was much greater than in controls , suggesting a greater sensitivity to actin disruptions in hypothyroid conditions. these results suggest that pc surface mechanical properties in hypothyroid cochleae at e <dig> and p <dig> are mediated through changes in actin.


cofilin activity mediates changes in actin dynamics under hypothyroid conditions
the results presented above suggested a relationship in which thyroid hormone levels might be acting through fgfr-signaling to induce actin-based stiffening of hypothyroid ohcs and pcs. therefore, we explored possible direct regulation of actin-modulating proteins in response to activation of the fgf-signaling pathway. in particular, receptor tyrosine kinases have the potential to mediate actin dynamics by controlling the phosphorylation of cofilin  <cit> . cofilin, when not phosphorylated by phosphorylated-lim-domain kinase , can increase the turnover of actin leading to increased polymerization of actin filaments  <cit> . to examine the potential role of this pathway, total protein was isolated from control and hypothyroid cochleae and then probed with antibodies against phosphorylated and total cofilin protein. at e <dig>  hypothyroid cochleae appeared to have lower levels of p-cofilin relative to control . to quantify this difference, the average relative density  of labeled protein was calculated and compared between control and hypothyroid conditions. total cofilin was not significantly different between control and hypothyroid conditions . a similar pattern of p-cofilin at e <dig> was also observed at p <dig>  with p-cofilin decreased from  <dig> â€‰Â±â€‰ <dig>  a.u. in control to  <dig> â€‰Â±â€‰ <dig>  a.u. in hypothyroid conditions . as was the case for e <dig>  total protein levels of cofilin were not significantly different between control and hypothyroid cochleae at p <dig> and p <dig>  by postnatal day  <dig> , the relative intensity and average relative density of p-cofilin labeled proteins were now similar between control and treated conditions . these results are consistent with the hypothesis that hypothyroidism leads to prolonged fgfr expression and activation, which may have the effect of decreasing phosphorylation of cofilin and, as a result, to increasing actin stability.


while the static localization of actin filaments has long been understood to maintain cell shape and membrane tension  <cit> , the dynamics of actin treadmilling for cell maturation and mechanics are just beginning to be realized. in particular, the dynamic actin cytoskeleton is primarily controlled by actin-binding proteins that regulate nucleation, polymerization and disassembly  <cit> . specifically, the actin-depolymerizing factor, cofilin, has been shown to be necessary for actin filament assembly  <cit> . the results presented above demonstrated decreased cofilin phosphorylation during hypothyroidism. however, changes in specific cell types could not be determined. therefore, in order to localize the observed changes in p-cofilin in hypothyroid cochleae, the expression of p-cofilin by immunofluorescence in cochlear cross-sections at e <dig>  p <dig>  and p <dig> was examined. at e <dig>  expression of p-cofilin was observed only in the nuclei of ohcs and cells of the greater epithelial ridge, but was present in both the cytoplasm and nuclei of supporting pillar cells and cells of the lesser epithelial ridge . this pattern of expression persisted in both basal and apical sections of control conditions through p <dig> . in hypothyroid conditions, p-cofilin immunofluorescence appeared to be reduced in the sensory epithelium relative to controls at e <dig>  p <dig>  and p <dig> . in particular, a marked reduction in p-cofilin was observed in pc cytoplasm and in ohc nuclei at p <dig> and p <dig> . these data support a role for lower cofilin phosphorylation in the stabilization of actin in pcs under hypothyroid conditions. the localization of p-cofilin in ohcs indicates that phosphorylation takes place predominantly in the nucleus, which suggests that cofilin is active primarily in the dense actin meshwork of sensory ohcs, and may explain in part the differences in ohc and pc responses to hypothyroidism.


discussion
effects of thyroid hormone signaling in the inner ear may be regulated through prolonged fgf-signaling
our data support previous findings that thyroid hormone levels coordinate the timing of development in many target tissues, including the skeletal  <cit>  and central nervous systems  <cit> . however, the specific molecular pathways that mediate the effects of thyroid hormone are largely still unknown. thyroid hormones primarily regulate transcriptional activity through thyroid hormone receptors . based on similarity in phenotypes and existing data from other systems, we examined fibroblast growth factor receptors after altering thyroid hormone levels. in the organ of corti, decreased levels of thyroid hormone were shown to result in prolonged expression of fgfr <dig> and fgfr <dig>  respectively , suggesting that thyroid hormone receptors negatively regulate fgf-receptor expression in the developing cochlea. interestingly, fgfr <dig> has been shown to accelerate differentiation when inactivated in differentiating osteoblasts  <cit>  and a thyroid hormone response element has been identified in the promoter region of fgfr <dig> <cit> . in the organ of corti, it seems that fgfr <dig> regulates the timing of hair cell and supporting cell development as shown by experiments in which ectopic activation of fgfr <dig> delays differentiation of supporting cells  <cit> . the observation of similar delays in the down-regulation of p75ntr and s <dig> proteins  in differentiating cells in hypothyroid conditions is consistent with the idea that the maintenance of fgfr <dig> signaling mediates at least some of the effects observed in hypothyroidism of the cochlea. however, these data do not rule out an additional layer of regulation by thyroid hormones on fgf-signaling. indeed, thyroid hormone has been shown to play a role in heparin sulfate expression in the developing growth plate  <cit> , which suggests an additional pathway, through which thyroid hormone could enhance fgf-signaling. overall, these findings suggest that the timing of down regulation of fgf-signaling is important for the developing inner ear. however, the persistent expression of both fgfr <dig> and of fgf <dig>  the most likely cognate ligand for fgfr <dig> in the organ of corti, into adult stages, suggests that fgf-signaling may also have a continuous role in inner ear tissue morphology. while it seems reasonable to suggest that the mechanism to decrease fgfr3-signaling would be to decrease the presence of ligand  <cit> , we propose that thyroid hormones might also mediate fgf-signaling at this stage of inner ear development by regulating the level of fgf-receptor expression in the organ of corti.

using the drug methimazole, hypothyroidism was induced in utero to examine the cellular response to a lack of thyroid hormone in the organ of corti. thyroid hormone levels in utero are thought to be primarily from a maternal source and transmitted through the placenta  <cit> . methimazole transmission has also been shown to cross the placenta  <cit>  and to reduce the serum levels of thyroid hormone  <cit> . while the effectiveness of this drug has led to widespread use as a treatment in clinical cases of hyperthyroidism for adults and, in particular, during pregnancy  <cit> , methimazole is not without side effects. in less than 1% of human subjects, agranulocytosis, a lowered white blood cell count, and liver toxicity resulting in jaundice were reported  <cit> . however, considering the relatively limited time course of methimazole treatment in these studies, it seems unlikely that the treatment led to these side effects.

thyroid hormone may disrupt cytoskeletal formation through prolonged fgf-signaling
a key observation of the experiments described here was the alteration in cytoskeletal formation in response to hypothyroidism. while disruption of the cytoskeleton in cases of hypothyroidism has long been known  <cit> , the molecular basis for these effects is not yet fully understood. the results presented here suggest that fgf signaling may act as an intermediary, with prolonged fgf-signaling leading to disruptions in microtubule formation. in the case of microtubule structure, we extend existing research by providing two complementary mechanisms for this hypothyroid-induced structural defect. first, deletion of fgfr <dig> leads to decreased Î²-tubulin  <cit> , further supporting the relationship between fgf-signaling and microtubule number. second, the increase in s100-a <dig> in pcs is representative of elevated intracellular calcium levels  <cit> , which could directly impair microtubule formation and is observed in fgfr3-deficient mice  <cit> .

in addition to the microtubule disruptions in pcs , there also appeared to be a higher fluorescence intensity of phalloidin-labeled actin in hypothyroid conditions relative to controls. phalloidin, a member of the phallotoxin group of f-actin binding peptides, has been used to quantify the amount of f-actin in cells  <cit> . this probe has a diameter of 12â€“ <dig> Ã…  <cit> , which has the advantages of low steric hindrance to bind close to a 1: <dig> ratio  <cit>  and therefore does not compete with actin binding proteins  <cit> . this probe also has a similar affinity for both large and small filaments  <cit> , but does not bind monomeric g-actin. this is a limitation of the technique as it is not possible with only one probe to examine whether or not the ratio of f-actin-to-g-actin has been altered in hypothyroid relative to control conditions. however, the advantages of this probe support our conclusion that stronger phalloidin fluorescence intensity, combined with electron micrographs showing no apparent difference in cuticular plate thickness, suggests that there is a higher density of actin, which may cause in part measured stiffening at the lumenal surface of the cochlea.

there is increasing evidence that fgf-signaling mediates actin dynamics through signaling  <cit> , which may be the key link between hypothyroidism and the observed cell structural defects. indeed, fgf-signaling is necessary for the dynamic changes in actin remodeling that lead to invagination of the developing otocyst  <cit> . in the hypothyroid cochlea, fgf-receptors might mediate actin dynamics through activation of p21-activated kinases  or rock  <cit>  that can then phosphorylate limk to inhibit cofilin activity via phosphorylation  <cit> . the prolonged fgfr-expression shown in hypothyroid conditions coincides with a decrease in phosphorylation of cofilin , which is consistent with the role for this protein in the rate of actin filament turnover. since both increased actin filaments and decreased cofilin phosphorylation were observed in hypothyroid cochleae, these results are consistent with this proposed mode of regulation. this might in part explain the disruption to ohc morphology , which is interesting given that recently it has been proposed in other developing tissues that the rearrangement of actin filaments generally would produce a disruption in cell morphology  <cit> . additionally, disrupted p75ntr expression has also been shown to mediate actin dynamics through down-regulation of rho-gtp signaling  <cit> . since p75ntr expression appeared to persist in hypothyroid conditions at p <dig> , the contribution of fgf-signaling may also contribute indirectly through a p75ntr-dependent mechanism.

alterations in cytoskeletal dynamics may affect cell mechanical properties
ultimately, impaired functional ability of supporting pcs to resist deformation at p <dig>  is not exactly concomitant with the decrease in microtubule number observed in electron micrographs of hypothyroid pillar cells relative to controls. however, it is possible that the lack of acetylation observed at p <dig> , and not absolute microtubule number, contributes to the formation of the tunnel of corti by the pillar cells. it is also possible that a lack of acetylation has other effects on microtubule length and polymerization  <cit> . future studies directly disrupting acetylation, while also controlling for microtubule length and protofilament number, will add important in vitro data that can be brought back into microtubule-based cell structural assays to further support what has been shown here.

in the case of actin structure, the findings that hypothyroid ohcs and pcs are aberrantly stiffer than controls  and are increasingly sensitive to latrunculin a  implicate the actin cytoskeleton, rather than microtubule development, in hypothyroid-induced cell stiffening observed from e <dig> to p <dig>  in this study, atomic force microscopy  has been used to probe cytoskeletal structures in living cells without membrane disruption or fixation. while the cell membrane is an integral part of stabilizing the cytoskeleton, previous results have shown that membrane stiffness is negligible in eukaryotic cells relative to cytoskeletal stiffness  <cit> . furthermore, with increasing indentation depthâ€”in this study indentation was  <dig>  Î¼mâ€”the bulk of youngâ€™s modulus has been shown to be the result of cytoskeletal stiffness  <cit> , and in the case of the developing cochlea, reflects the stiffness of the actin mesh at the cell apex. indeed, by combining afm with live-cell fluorescence imaging techniques, it is possible to get single cell specificity. for example, after treatment with the cytoskeletal disrupting agent latrunculin a, the ohc but not the neighboring pc youngâ€™s modulus was decreased in cochlear explant cultures. overall, these afm data suggest that the calculated youngâ€™s modulus reflects cell surface mechanical properties, which are dominated by cytoskeletal components.

cell-specific responses to thyroid hormone may lend insight into cell structural development
while data presented here were only able to measure the consequences of disrupted actin dynamics in hair cells and supporting pcs, disruptions to actin dynamics could have broad consequences for many supporting cell types in the developing organ of corti. for example, the greater epithelial ridge is composed of columnar epithelial cells that undergo structural changes leading to the formation of the fluid filled space known as the inner sulcus  <cit> . while we know that these cells support synapse formation of sensory inner hair cells in the organ of corti  <cit> , the aberrant cell cytoplasm in this region may explain part of the pathology of hypothyroidism. by localizing phosphorylated cofilin expression in control and hypothyroid cochlear cross-sections , we observed not only the aberrant defect in the sensory epithelium, but also the cell-specific differences in phosphorylated cofilin expression throughout the cochlear duct. cofilin phosphorylation has also been observed to mediate actin dynamics in a number of developing systems  <cit> . the relationship between hypothyroidism and cell-structural defects in the developing cochlea might prove to be the basis for additional studies of morphogenesis in developing systems that rely on coordination by thyroid hormones  <cit> . future studies also examining actin dynamics under reduced thyroid hormone levels could lend insight into a mechanism by which developmental malformations to the structure and function of the organ of corti may be prevented.

CONCLUSIONS
we find that hypothyroidism leads to a delay in the down-regulation of fgf-receptors and to a decrease in microtubule formation and acetylation at early postnatal stages. while the lack of microtubules ultimately reduce supporting pillar cell stiffness, we find that hypothyroidism actually stiffens outer hair cells at p <dig> and pillar cells at e <dig> and p <dig> as a result of increased f-actin. our data also show that the increased dynamics of actin in these cells might be the result of hypothyroid-induced fgf signaling and a decreased phosphorylation of cofilin. together, these data implicate the sensitivity of cell structural development to thyroid hormones, and suggest that thyroid hormone signaling might coordinate the time-course of tissue morphogenesis.
