BACKGROUND
bovine anaplasmosis is one of the most important tick-borne diseases of ruminants worldwide. the disease is caused by infection of cattle with the obligate intraerythrocytic bacteria anaplasma marginale which is classified in the family anaplasmataceae, order rickettsiales  <cit> . the acute phase of the bovine anaplasmosis is characterized by anemia, icterus, weight loss, fever, abortion, decreased milk production and often results in death  <cit> . animals surviving the acute phase develop a lifelong persistent infection and can serve as reservoirs for mechanical transmission and biological transmission by ticks  <cit> .

anaplasmosis is endemic in tropical and sub-tropical regions where the disease constitutes a constraint to the cattle production. in europe anaplasmosis is endemic in several mediterranean countries including italy  <cit> , portugal  <cit>  and spain  <cit> , and has occasionally been reported in austria  <cit> , switzerland  <cit>  and hungary  <cit> . mechanical transmission of a. marginale is effected by blood-contaminated fomites, including hypodermic needles, castration instruments, ear tagging devices, tattooing instruments, and dehorning saws or by blood-contaminated mouthparts of biting flies  <cit> . biological transmission is effected by ticks and over  <dig> species of ticks have been incriminated as vectors worldwide  <cit> . while the one-host ticks, rhipicephalus  microplus and r. annulatus, were eradicated from the united states in the early 1940s, they are the main tick vectors in tropical and subtropical areas  <cit> . currently, dermacentor spp.  are the major tick vectors of a. marginale in the u.s.  <cit> .

a. marginale undergoes a complex developmental cycle in ticks that begins with infection of gut cells from infected erythrocytes ingested with the tick bloodmeal  <cit> . development of the final infective stage occurs in salivary glands from where the pathogen is transmitted to cattle. a major means of a. marginale transmission appears to be by male dermacentor ticks which become persistently infected. these males are intermittent feeders and can feed and transmit a. marginale multiple times as they transfer among cattle, thus effecting intrastadial transmission  <cit> .

the vectorial capacity of tick species for a. marginale in europe has not been well defined. recent reports of endemicity of anaplasmosis in european countries  <cit>  and of outbreaks in countries previously thought to be free of anaplasmosis, including switzerland, warranted studies on the role of putative tick vector  <cit> . the broad distribution range of d. reticulatus, which extends from the british isles to central asia  <cit> , as well as the expanded geographic distribution of this tick as recently reported in germany  <cit> , hungary  <cit>  and the netherlands  <cit> , warrants further study of d. reticulatus as a vector for a. marginale in europe.

RESULTS
infection and acquisition feeding
infection of calf no.  <dig> with the a. marginale zaria isolate was detected on day  <dig> post exposure  when the body temperature increased to  <dig> °c and depression and anorexia were observed. the percent reduction pcv was 50% and the a. marginale percent parasitized erythrocytes  was 6% . a. marginale infection was subsequently confirmed by msp <dig> pcr. after infestations of the calf on the day  <dig> p.i. with  <dig> male and  <dig> female d. reticulatus ticks when the ppe was  <dig> % , all female ticks and  <dig> of the male ticks attached and fed successfully. based on pcr testing of one salivary gland from each of the  <dig> male tick halves, the infection percentage was 30%. the presence of a. marginale colonies in salivary gland cells was confirmed by light microscopy examination  in the other half of the pcr positive ticks.

transmission feeding
male d. reticulatus ticks transmitted a. marginale zaria isolate to calf no.  <dig>  on day  <dig> p.i. the calf tested pcr positive. inclusion bodies were detected in erythrocytes on day  <dig> in giemsa-stained blood smears and the peak parasitemia was 2%. while minimal clinical symptoms of anaplasmosis were observed, the body temperature increased during the peak of parasitemia up to  <dig> °c, the percent reduction pcv was  <dig> %  and the mucosal membranes became pale. five out of  <dig>  ticks that were attached successfully were pcr positive for a. marginale.

verification of isolate identity
the a. marginale isolate genetic identity was confirmed by pcr in samples collected during persistent infection in calf, during replication and development in ticks and after subsequent transmission to the susceptible calf. subsequent sequencing of the msp <dig> and msp1α genes also confirmed the isolate identity since the msp <dig> and msp1α sequences were the same in all tick and cattle samples. the msp1α sequence of the zaria isolate contained two novel repeat forms which were labelled as  <dig> and  <dig> following the nomenclature of de la fuente et al. <cit>  .

discussion
a. marginale infection in cattle and wild ruminants was reported in several parts of europe, including the mediterranean countries of spain and portugal  <cit> , italy  <cit> , and occasionally in france  <cit> , the alpine region of switzerland  <cit>  and more recently in hungary  <cit> . however, the epidemiology of anaplasmosis in europe has not been thoroughly investigated and local vector species were not identified.

in the mediterranean region, several tick species have been incriminated as the potential biological vectors of a. marginale. hyalomma m. marginatum and rhipicephalus bursa were found on iberian red deer in spain that proved to be infected with a. marginale  <cit>  and these ticks were therefore listed as putative tick vectors. furthermore, a. marginale is endemic in sicily and has been reported elsewhere from italy, and several tick species have been identified in this area that may be vectors, including rhipicephalus turanicus and haemaphysalis punctata that were collected from a. marginale infected cattle  <cit> .

although anaplasmosis was reported in more northern latitudes, the tick vectors have not been identified. for instance, a. marginale was recently reported to be endemic in hungary and the predominant tick species present on cattle in the study area was d. reticulatus  <cit> . in the united states, several dermacentor spp. are known to be vectors of anaplasmosis  <cit> . while d. reticulatus is known to be a vector of babesia canis  <cit> , rickettsia slovaca  <cit>  and coxiella burnetii  <cit> , the vector competency of this tick for a. marginale has not been determined until now.

the a. marginale strain used in this study originated from zaria, nigeria. although bovine anaplasmosis occurs in large areas of africa and a few isolates from south africa have been characterized, this isolate from west africa had not been reported previously and proved to have unique msp1a and msp <dig> sequences. the a. marginale msp <dig> gene, which is a stable marker for the genetic characterization of strains, does not undergo antigenic variation when cycling between tick and mammalian hosts  <cit> . msp1a, encoded by msp1α, is involved in the adhesion and transmission of a. marginale by ticks and varies in the number and sequence of amino-terminal tandem repeats among geographic strains  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this research we have demonstrated the vector competency of male d. reticulatus as an experimental biological vector of a. marginale by intrastadial transmission. further studies are needed to confirm the vectorial role of d. reticulatus in europe by use of a. marginale isolates derived from naturally infected cattle and ticks from endemic areas. dermacentor spp. from a. marginale endemic regions should be studied, including d. marginatus which is commonly found on cattle and wildlife reservoir hosts.
