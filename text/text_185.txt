BACKGROUND
monogenic forms of permanent neonatal diabetes have revealed key aspects of the development and function of the insulin secreting beta cells  <cit> . mutations in perk  underlies the complex genetic disorder of the wolcott rallison syndrome, which includes permanent neonatal diabetes , exocrine pancreas deficiency, growth retardation, hepatic dysfunctions, and skeletal dysplasias  <cit> . all of the dysfunctions in wrs are mirrored in mice deficient for perk  <cit> , and detailed genetic studies in mice have shown that the diabetes is caused by the loss of expression of perk in the insulin secreting beta cells  <cit> , whereas the exocrine pancreas deficiency is caused by the absence of perk in the pancreatic acinar cells  <cit> . the initial interpretation of the molecular basis of these dysfunctions in humans and mice was based upon studies performed in vitro with cultured fibroblasts  <cit> . these studies showed that the catalytic domain of perk resides in the cytoplasm where it phosphorylates the translation initiation factor eif <dig> alpha, which results in either repression of global protein synthesis or activation of translation of specific mrnas encoding gene regulatory proteins. perk regulatory domain resides in the lumen of the er and is controlled by the binding of the er chaperone proteins, grp78/bip and grp <dig>  and calcium  <cit> . disturbances in the er such as er stress and accumulation of unfolded proteins, or normal physiological changes in calcium levels can activate perk  <cit> . based upon these studies it was proposed that pnd in humans and mice deficient in perk was caused by uncontrolled er stress and apoptotic cell death of the beta cells  <cit> . however a recent comprehensive analysis of the islet and beta cell development revealed that the cause of diabetes in perk deficient mice is due to failure to expand beta cell mass and defects in beta cell development and insulin secretion during the critical fetal and neonatal periods  <cit> . thus three distinct defects are seen in perk-deficient beta cells, which raises questions about the causal connection and progression of beta cell dysfunction. the chronic loss of perk expression over the four-week period between when defects in beta cell development are first seen during the fetal stage and the onset of overt diabetes three weeks after birth confounds resolving these questions and determining the molecular basis of the defects in perk-deficient mice. to investigate the acute effects of perk ablation we have expressed a dominant negative mutation of perk in the transformed ins <dig> 832/ <dig> beta cell line. we found that acute ablation of perk in 832/ <dig> beta cells mimics all of the defects seen in the beta cells of perk-deficient mice and detailed temporal studies suggest that defects in the function of the endoplasmic reticulum may give rise to the defects in beta cell developmental and proliferation.

RESULTS
ablation of perk in ins <dig> 832/ <dig> beta cells results in reduced insulin gene expression, insulin content, and insulin secretion
to investigate the acute effects of ablating perk expression, the transformed rat ins 832/ <dig> insulin-secreting beta cells  <cit>  were transduced with a dominant negative mutant of perk using the adenoviral vector  yielding addnperk-832/ <dig> beta cells. the addnperk transgene contains a c-terminal truncation of the kinase domain of mouse perk  <cit>  tagged with c-myc which was inserted into an adenoviral vector that contains a gfp marker to monitor transduction efficiency. an adenoviral vector expressing the e. coli lacz  denoted adlacz was used throughout as a control. after 24- <dig> hours post-transduction of addnperk, greater than 90% of the 832/ <dig> beta cells were successfully transduced as shown by expression of the gfp marker . the dnperk protein was detected  in transduced 832/ <dig> beta cells, and significantly ablated the activity of the endogenous perk as shown by reduced levels of phosphorylated eif <dig> alpha . ablation of perk resulted in a significant reduction of the insulin- <dig>  insulin- <dig>  mafa, and glut <dig> mrnas while the expression of other important genes in beta cell development and function including pdx- <dig>  neurod, and gck were nearly normal . in parallel to decreased insulin- <dig> and insulin- <dig> mrna expression, insulin content per beta cell was significantly reduced as a function of the dose of dn-perk transduced in the 832/ <dig> beta cells  mirroring the reduced insulin content of the pancreatic islets of perk ko mice  <cit> .

islets isolated from neonatal perk ko mice exhibited an almost complete ablation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion   <cit> . to determine if an acute deficiency of perk impacts insulin secretion, 832/ <dig> beta cells were transduced with addnperk. forty-eight hours post-transduction of addnperk-832/ <dig> cells showed a 3-fold reduction in insulin secretion in response to  <dig> mm glucose stimulation compared to 832/ <dig> transduced with the adlacz control . treatment of addnperk-832/ <dig> cells with tolbutamide, a katp channel blocker, also showed reduced enhancement of glucose stimulated insulin secretion compared to the control cells. treatment with diazoxide, a katp channel opener, blocked glucose-stimulated insulin secretion  in both genotypes as expected. we conclude that the reduced gsis is due to a combination of decreased insulin content as well from a partial reduction in katp-dependent insulin secretion.

proliferation of addnperk 832/ <dig> beta cells is reduced
the cell proliferation rate of addnperk-832/ <dig> and lacz-832/ <dig> beta cells was estimated by brdu incorporation. addnperk-832/ <dig> exhibited a 25% reduction in proliferation compared to adlacz-832/ <dig>  consistent with a general observation of the relative growth rates of these cells across several independent experiments . cell death, estimated as tunel positive cells, was low in both genotypes and not significantly different from each other .

accumulation of proinsulin in the er occurs in the absence of increased protein synthesis in perk deficient beta cells
proinsulin is co-translationally imported into the endoplasmic reticulum and rapidly enters the golgi complex  <cit>  where it accumulates in beta cells prior to its maturation and formation of insulin secretory granules  <cit> . in perk ko mice, however, a large fraction  of the beta cells exhibited grossly distended endoplasmic reticulum with a very high accumulation of proinsulin  <cit> ; these abnormal cells are denoted herein as impacted-er beta cells. acute ablation of perk in 832/ <dig> cells also resulted in appearance of impacted-er cells as characterized by a shift of the majority of proinsulin from the golgi complex to the endoplasmic reticulum . in contrast we have not observed impacted-er cells in the control adlacz-832/ <dig> cells  or in the pancreatic islets of wild-type mice .

when perk is highly activated by er stress it represses global protein synthesis  <cit> , and it has been speculated that the loss of perk function may result in derepressed protein synthesis and over accumulation of proteins in the er. conversely, we found that global protein synthesis rates were not elevated in addnperk-832/ <dig> cells  and proinsulin content was reduced, not increased . thus the over accumulation of proinsulin in the er is not due to over synthesis of proinsulin.

erp <dig> and grp78/bip expression are induced first after initiating acute ablation of perk followed by other changes in gene expression
to further explore the possible causes and consequences of proinsulin retention in er in perk-deficient beta cells, the expression of key er chaperone, trafficking, erad genes were examined in 832/ <dig> cells that had been transduced with a relatively low titer  of addnperk and in pancreatic islets isolated from neonatal  perk ko mice. using a lower titer of addnperk, ins <dig>  ins <dig>  and glut <dig> were expressed at normal levels , unlike that seen at high titers  and perk ko islets where these genes were significantly repressed compared to control. mafa mrna was significantly repressed in both addnperk-832/ <dig> and perk ko islets. the er chaperone genes erp <dig> and grp78/bip were substantially induced while most other er chaperones  and erad associated  genes were not significantly elevated . to determine the temporal pattern of the induction of these genes following acute ablation of perk, the mrna level of several genes was assessed at various time points after transduction of 832/ <dig> beta cells with addnperk . ins <dig>  ins <dig>  and mafa were not significantly reduced until  <dig> hours after transduction, whereas erp <dig> and grp78/bip were induced after only  <dig> hours. the beta cells of perk ko mice showed reduced expression of several cell-cycle and proliferation genes associated with a substantial reduction in beta proliferation  <cit> . cyclin a and cyclin d mrnas were also reduced in addnperk-832/ <dig> beta cells but not until  <dig> hours. the splicing of xbp- <dig> mrna is a sensitive indicator of the er stress response, and the over accumulation of proinsulin is predicted to elicit and an er stress response, but surprisingly neither beta cells in perk deficient mice or addnperk-832/ <dig> beta cells showed increased splicing of xbp- <dig> mrna . increased expression of erp <dig> in addnperk-832/ <dig> cells was also seen by immunohistochemistry earlier than the appearance of the impacted-er cells . we further tested the hypothesis that unrepressed global protein synthesis is responsible for the induction of the er chaperones erp <dig> and grp78/bip by treating addnperk-832/ <dig> beta cells with cyclohexamide, a potent inhibitor of protein synthesis. cyclohexamide did not block the induction of erp <dig> and grp78/bip in addnperk-832/ <dig> beta cells  and did not reduce or delay the appearance of impacted-er beta cells  thus arguing against this hypothesis.

the values represent the levels of specific mrnas in addnperk-transduced cells normalized to adlacz-transduced controls as determined by real-time quantitative rt-pcr. time points  indicate hours after transduction. the data are the average of two to five independent experiments. * p <  <dig> 

erp <dig> and grp78/bip are induced by the transcription factor atf <dig>  <cit> . although we could not readily detect the active nuclear form of atf <dig> in 832/ <dig> beta cells , we examined the processing of atf <dig> in the human embryonic kidney ad <dig> cell line co-transfected with plasmids bearing atf <dig> and dnperk or vector control and treated with dtt, an er stress inducer. as expected, atf <dig> processing was induced by dtt in control cells . however, in ad <dig> cells transfected with dnperk, the processed nuclear form of atf <dig> was present at relatively high levels in untreated cells and not further induced by dtt. as new protein synthesis is not required for the induction of erp <dig> and bip mrna expression following acute ablation of perk, post-translational processing of atf <dig> to its active nuclear form is consistent with the hypothesis that atf <dig> is responsible for their induction.

erp <dig> protein expression and oxidized state is increased in perk-ablated 832/ <dig> cells
erp <dig>  a family member of the protein disulfide isomerases , is localized in the er and plays a major role in quality control and folding  <cit> . these pdi enzymes are particularly important for er client proteins such as proinsulin that depend upon cysteine disulfide bonds for their folded structure. indeed we have found that erp <dig> was physically associated with proinsulin in 832/ <dig> cells . as seen for erp <dig> mrna levels, erp <dig> protein was elevated in addnperk-832/ <dig> beta cells and similar increases were seen for grp78/bip . in perk ko mice we found that the amount of erp <dig> was elevated  and became localized to large balloon-like structures in impacted-er cells . comparison of the erp <dig> localization seen in ihc images  to tem images of impacted-er beta cells  <cit>  suggest that these structures correspond to one of two types of distended er most similar to russell bodies  <cit> . these erp <dig> enriched structures were rarely observed in the addnperk-832/ <dig> cells.

the redox state of the pdi family of er folding enzymes including erp <dig> and erp <dig> is known to vary according to changes in the oxidative and functional states of the er. in addition to increased levels of erp <dig> protein, addnperk-832/ <dig> beta cells exhibited an increase in the oxidized isoforms of erp <dig> and erp <dig>  that were first seen at  <dig> hours post transduction and increased significantly by  <dig> hours.

discussion
despite the vast differences between the milieu and ontogeny of cultured beta cells and native beta cells in the endocrine pancreas, we found that the array of defects in the beta cells of perk ko mice  <cit>  were remarkably present following acute ablation of perk in the transformed rat ins <dig> 832/ <dig> beta cells. these defects include reduced cell proliferation , reduced expression of proinsulin and insulin, reduced glucose-stimulated insulin-secretion, and abnormal retention of proinsulin in the er leading some cells to have a highly distended er. that these defects underlie the cause of neonatal diabetes in perk ko mice, and by inference in humans with the wolcott rallison syndrome, was shown by the study of tissue-specific perk ko mice and the ability of a beta cell specific-perk transgene to rescue diabetes  <cit> . given the close correspondence of cellular pathology of the addnperk-832/ <dig> beta cells to the beta cells of perk ko mice, we were encouraged to take advantage of cultured beta cells to elucidate the molecular function of perk in regulating beta cell development and physiology.

acute ablation of perk, afforded by transduction of the dominant negative perk transgene, allowed us to determine the progress and order of the ensuing defects over time. as we had seen in perk ko mice, the expression of insulin synthesis genes ins- <dig>  ins- <dig>  and mafa) and cell cycle genes was reduced but the reduction in their expression lagged behind the induction of the er chaperone genes erp <dig> and grp78/bip thus suggesting that a perturbation in the er may result in repression of genes involved in beta cell function and proliferation. initial reports showing that loss of perk function resulted in neonatal diabetes in humans and mice  <cit>  suggested that the molecular defect was related to the function of perk in the regulation of the er stress - unfolded protein response . our extensive analyses of perk-deficient beta cells in mice  <cit>  and in addnperk-832/ <dig> beta cells in culture have not supported this hypothesis. the original hypothesis assumed that global protein synthesis would be derepressed as a direct consequence of the absence of perk, and that this would result in uncontrolled protein synthesis and overloading of the er culminating in apoptotic cell death  <cit> . although the er in perk-deficient beta cells show marked accumulation of proinsulin, we found that global protein synthesis was not elevated nor was there an elevation in the proinsulin content in beta cells. cell death did not increase, but instead cell proliferation was ablated. moreover, the expression of erp <dig> and grp78/bip was still induced in addnperk-832/ <dig> beta cells after blocking protein synthesis with cyclohexamide suggesting that their induction was not due to protein overload.

erp <dig> and grp78/bip are positively regulated and insulin gene expression is negatively regulated by atf <dig>  <cit> , and we found that the processed nuclear form of atf <dig> was substantially increased in perk-ablated ad <dig> cells. treatment of cells with brefeldin-a also induces the processing of the atf <dig>  <cit> , which is caused by relocalization of the s2p protease from the golgi to the er. we found that the s2p protease is indeed mislocalized in perk-ablated ad <dig> cells and is associated with er markers , which suggests that the increased basal level of the nuclear form of atf <dig> is due to mislocalization of the proteases that cleave precursor atf <dig> rather than by er stress. further studies are required to confirm the importance of these findings in insulin-secreting beta cells.

in addition to its role in repressing global protein synthesis during er stress, perk positively regulates the translation of atf <dig>  which in turn upregulates gadd153/chop  <cit> . mutations in these downstream genes, however, do not lead to diabetes in mice,  <cit>  thus arguing against the hypothesis that diabetes associated with perk deficiency is related to the role of perk in regulating the unfolded protein response. considerable evidence suggests that perk is important for mediating the er stress response in adult beta cells  <cit> , but we argue that the primary function of perk in beta cells is to regulate beta cell development and function during the fetal-neonatal period. interestingly ire <dig>  another mediator of the er stress response, has also been shown to have an important beta cell function by positively regulating insulin biosynthesis  <cit> .

we speculate that the impacted-er phenotype, characterized by gross distension of the endoplasmic reticulum and abnormal retention of proinsulin observed in perk-deficient beta cells, represents the extreme manifestation of er dysfunction. the induction of erp <dig> and grp/ <dig> mrna expression is the first hint of er dysfunction, and is followed by increased levels of these proteins and the oxidized isoform of erp <dig> and erp <dig>  the increased oxidized isoforms of erp <dig> and erp <dig> suggests that redox state of the er is abnormal or that the oxidation and reduction of protein disulfides is imbalanced. the formation of disulfide bonds is essential for the proper folding proinsulin and subsequent maturation of insulin  <cit> . the protein disulfide isomerase family including erp <dig>  pdi, and erp <dig>  mediate their oxidative protein folding functions by forming transient mixed disulfides with er client proteins  <cit>  such as proinsulin. in addition to catalyzing the proper folding of proteins in preparation for transport from the er to the golgi, the pdi enzymes participate in er associated protein degradation  by reducing thiols of misfolded proteins in preparation for retrotranslocation to the cytoplasm for proteosomal degradation  <cit> . recently forster and colleagues  <cit>  have shown that erp <dig> and pdi have opposing functions in the er. erp <dig> assists proper protein folding whereas pdi facilitates unfolding of misfolded proteins in preparation for proteosomal degradation. we propose that perk regulates the expression of key genes that encode er redox and protein folding functions in the insulin-secreting beta cells during the dynamic metabolic changes that occur during the developmental transitions through embryonic, fetal, neonatal, and juvenile stages. perk enzyme activity is regulated through its er luminal domain via binding of grp78/bip complexed with calcium  <cit> . physiological changes in er calcium modulate perk activity  <cit>  as well as insulin secretion. the regulation of er calcium is coupled to the redox state of specific er proteins including serca, the major er calcium pump  <cit> . we speculate that perk acts as an er calcium sensor that couples er functions of folding, quality control, and protein trafficking that are intimately tied to the redox state of the er as a function of the dynamic changes in the physiological environment of the beta cell during the early developmental transitions.

CONCLUSIONS
we found that acute ablation of perk in the transformed 832/ <dig> beta cell line leads to reduced proliferation and reduced insulin gene expression, insulin content, and insulin secretion, demonstrating that acute ablation of perk recapitulates the major cellular and molecular defects seen in perk ko mice. in addition proinsulin accumulates abnormally in the er, which occurs after the elevation of two key chaperone proteins grp78/bip and erp <dig>  erp <dig> accumulates in a sub compartment of the er and its oxidized isoform is substantially increased. because the changes in the expression of grp78/bip and erp <dig> are the earliest changes observed after ablation of perk, we suggest that er dysfunctions give rise to defects in proinsulin trafficking, insulin secretion, and cell proliferation.
