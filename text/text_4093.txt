BACKGROUND
cardiac contractility is significantly enhanced by the dynamic phosphorylation of a number of sarcomeric proteins, including cardiac myosin binding protein c   <cit> . this highly modular protein, found in the c-zone of the sarcomere, is encoded by a gene which is frequently implicated in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy   <cit> , a common inherited cardiac disease characterised by hypertrophy of the ventricular muscle  <cit> . there are multiple isoforms of this protein; the cardiac isoform differs from its skeletal counterparts by containing an extra immunoglobulin-like  domain  at the amino terminal, a charged residue-rich insertion in domain c <dig> and three phosphorylation sites in a motif between the second and third igi domains , known as the mybpc motif or m-domain. originally thought to have only a structural role, cmybpc has been shown to play an important role in the regulation of cardiac contractility  <cit> , for which the n-terminal region of the protein appears to be crucial. upon β-adrenergic stimulation, three sites within the mybpc motif are phosphorylated by protein kinase a  and calcium/calmodulin-activated protein kinase , the phosphorylation of this region of mybpc then leads to rearrangement of the myosin crossbridges and thick filament structure  <cit>  such that cardiac contractility is increased  <cit> .

however, since these kinases regulate a broad range of cellular responses, their compartmentalization in close proximity to their sarcomeric targets is required to facilitate control over which proteins are phosphorylated in response to second messenger signalling  <cit> . at the same time, co-compartmentalization of enzymes or proteins that generate or terminate these second messenger metabolites, such as the phosphodiesterases  which degrade camp and cgmp, with the relevant responsive kinases helps to optimise the precision and speed of response to second messenger signaling  <cit> . compartmentalization of kinases in general is achieved by either direct docking of the kinase on the target protein, or by anchoring of the kinase to, or close to, the target via an adaptor protein, named a-kinase anchoring proteins or akaps in the case of pka  <cit> . although a camk has been found to co-purify with cmybpc  <cit> , the mechanism of co-compartmentalization of cmybpc and pka has never been described and very little is known about sarcomeric akaps in general.

in this study we identified myomegalin  isoform  <dig>  a pde4d-interacting protein  <cit> , as a binding partner of pka, the cmybpc n-terminal region, as well as other pka-targets, and show that mmgl meets all the requirements for classification as a novel sarcomeric akap, with important implications for regulation of cardiac contractility during adrenergic stimulation.

RESULTS
interaction of trisphospho-cmybpc with mmgl
as the interactions of the n-terminal region of cmybpc under its various phosphorylation states appear to be integral to the regulatory role of cmybpc in contractility, we aimed to gain further insight into the interactions of the trisphosphorylated form of the n-terminal region of cmybpc. thus, we used a construct of c1-c <dig> in which the serines in the three phosphorylation sites of the mybpc motif had been replaced by glutamic acids , mimicking the trisphosphorylated state, as bait in a y2h cardiac library screen.

during successive rounds of nutritional and colorimetric selection,  <dig> putative interactors of ppp were identified, which were able to activate the his <dig>  ade <dig> and mel <dig> reporter genes in the presence of the ppp bait, but not in the presence of heterologous baits . of these, three in-frame prey plasmids encoded isoform  <dig> of pde4d-interacting protein, also known as myomegalin  . this putative interaction between mmgl and the n-terminal of cmybpc was intriguing, as the former protein is known to anchor pde4d to particulate structures; pde4d, in turn, is known to hydrolyze camp and thus to attenuate pka-driven phosphorylation  <cit> . furthermore, it has been shown that some adaptor proteins can anchor both pka and pde4d  <cit> , raising the possibility that mmgl may be anchoring pka to at least cmybpc in the sarcomere as an akap; hence this interaction was prioritized for further investigation.

3d-fluorescence microscopy indicated that cmybpc and mmgl isoform  <dig> colocalize in the cytoplasmic  region of differentiated rat cardiac h9c <dig> cells . exposure of the cells to the adrenergic agonist isoproterenol led to an increase in co-localization of the two proteins, as evidenced by the increased yellow staining during fluorescence microscopy of such cells .

furthermore, in order to verify that it is the c1-c <dig> region of cmybpc that interacts with mmgl isoform  <dig>  specifically, and does so in the absence of the gal <dig> regions of the y2h bait protein, we used in vitro co-immunoprecipitation assays. we also used these assays to assess whether trisphosphorylation of the mybpc motif within this region was crucial to the putative interaction. both the native c1-c <dig> and a trisphospho-mimic of the c1-c <dig> region interacted with mmgl isoform  <dig> in the absence of the y2h gal <dig> domains , suggesting that the interaction can take place whether or not the mybpc-motif is phosphorylated. interaction between cmybpc and mmgl isoform  <dig> was further confirmed in a cellular environment by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation of these tagged proteins in h9c <dig> cells .

mmgl binds to pka regulatory subunits
as the primary characteristic of an akap is the ability to bind at least one pka regulatory subunit, we investigated the possibility that mmgl functions as an akap by using y2h-based direct protein-protein interaction assays to determine binding between mmgl and the two cardiac-expressed regulatory subunits of pka. both regulatory subunits  interacted with mmgl, as assessed by growth and light colour of the colonies on quadruple dropout nutritional selection medium, compared to relevant controls .

further support for this finding was garnered by co-localization studies using 3d-fluorescence microscopy: we demonstrated that mmgl isoform  <dig> occurs in the same 3d-subcellular region as the two pka regulatory isoforms in h9c <dig> cardiomyocytes .

to further verify physical interaction between mmgl and these pka isoforms in a cellular context and in the absence of gal <dig> domains, we performed pull-down assays in differentiated h9c <dig> cardiomyocytes. as commercial antibodies against mmgl/pde4dip are not able to detect isoform  <dig>  the smallest isoform of this protein, we used an antibody directed against dsred to detect a dsred-tagged version of mmgl isoform  <dig> in these assays. in this way, endogenous prkar1a and prkar2a were shown to immunoprecipitate dsred-mmgl, and vice versa , indicating physical interaction of mmgl with these two pka regulatory isoforms.

mmgl binds to additional pka targets
we further investigated the function of mmgl isoform  <dig> by using it as y2h bait to screen a cardiac cdna library in order to identify its additional binding partners. thirteen in-frame putative mmgl-interactors were identified that activated all three nutritional reporter genes in the presence of the mmgl bait, but not in the presence of heterologous baits . as we were primarily interested in the possibility of mmgl acting as a sarcomeric akap, proteins with defined vesicular localizations were not considered of primary interest for follow-up in this study; these included the mitochondrial protein cox5a, the proteosome 26s subunit and the endosomal protein snx <dig>  of the remaining ten putative mmgl interactors, six encoded cardiac troponin i  .

further support for the validity of these interactions was provided by finding that mmgl occurs in the same 3d-subcellular region as all five of the putative interactors identified in the y2h library screen, viz. cardiac ankyrin repeat protein , copper metabolism gene murr <dig> domain  <dig> , α-enolase , β-enolase  , and cardiac troponin i  , in differentiated cardiomyocytes.

moreover, in pull-down assays, exogenous, fluorescently-tagged mmgl and endogenous eno <dig>  eno <dig>  carp and ctni reciprocally co-precipitated each other . as commd <dig> had a similar mobility to antibody light chains, which interfered with detection of these proteins in western blots, a gfp-tagged fusion of this protein was expressed in h9c <dig> cells for pull-down assays. in these assays, exogenous gfp-commd <dig> immunoprecipitated exogenous dsred-mmgl, and vice versa . thus, western blot analysis data supported the proposed interaction of mmgl with eno <dig>  eno <dig>  carp, ctni and commd <dig> 

ctni is a known pka target  <cit> , while the remaining four putative interactors were shown to be likely targets using phosphomotif finder http://www.hprd.org/phosphomotif_finder; we therefore investigated the effect of isoproterenol stimulation of the h9c <dig> cells on co-localization, using the most frequent, and sarcomeric-located, putative interactor, ctni, as example. treating h9c <dig> cells transfected with dsred-mmgl/gfp-ctni with isoproterenol resulted in significantly more 3d co-localization between these two proteins, as shown in figure 5b and 5c, compared to non-treated cells.

thus, our results strongly suggest that mmgl interacts with both pka regulatory isoforms, as well as with each of the prioritized five putative prey interactors identified in the y2h screen, in a cellular milieu, and in the absence of the gal <dig> domains.

effect of mmgl knockdown
in order to evaluate the role of mmgl in cmybpc phosphorylation, we assessed the expression of the different phosphorylation isoforms of cmybpc, in the context of sirna-mediated mmgl knockdown. typically, interference with akap-functioning is commonly more noticeable on the target protein only after adrenergic stimulation  <cit> , thus we also tested the effect of mmgl knockdown in the presence of adrenergic stimulation. of four sirnas tested, rn_rgd:708410_3_hp sirna   was found to provide optimal knockdown of mmgl  in h9c <dig> cells ; thus mmgl  <dig> sirna was used in subsequent experiments to silence mmgl gene expression.

using western blots of 2-dimensional ief gels, we found that similar amounts of the mono- and diphosphorylated forms of cmybpc were expressed in untreated h9c <dig> cells, while lesser amounts of the un- and trisphosphorylated forms, relative to the other isoforms, were present . when these cells were exposed to increased cacl <dig> and isoproterenol, to activate camk and pka such that maximum phosphorylation of the mybpc-motif is likely <cit> , the relative amount of the trisphosphorylated form increases markedly, while the relative amount of unphosphorylated cmybpc decreased . in untreated cells lacking mmgl, all four forms of cmybpc are present, with amounts of mono- and diphosphorylated forms similar and exceeding the amounts of un- and trisphosphorylated forms, similar to what was seen with untreated, wild-type cells. however, adrenergic stimulation in the presence of mmgl knockdown resulted in very low expression of all isoforms . this finding is compatible with previous findings of an inverse relationship between phosphorylation of cmybpc and its proteolytic degradation, suggesting that phosphorylated cmybpc is protected against proteolytic cleavage, whereas absence of phosphorylation results in increased degradation of the protein and reduced levels of cmybpc in the cell  <cit> .

discussion
myomegalin has been characterized as a protein with the properties of a scaffold or structural protein that is expressed at high levels in skeletal and cardiac tissue, suggesting an important function in muscle, and which interacts with a camp-specific phosphodiesterase  <cit> . however, the precise function and interactions of this protein, and its five isoforms, have been largely unknown. we here describe how the smallest mmgl isoform, isoform  <dig>  binds to known and predicted pka targets in the cardiac myocyte, including some sarcomeric proteins, viz. cmybpc, ctni, eno <dig>  eno <dig>  carp and commd <dig> . moreover, we show that mmgl isoform  <dig> interacts with two regulatory subunits of pka . together these results describe mmgl isoform  <dig> as a novel sarcomeric akap, which, like makap  <cit> , is involved in assembling a pka/pde camp signalling module.

in addition to interacting with both types of regulatory subunits, viz. ri and rii, which qualifies mmgl isoform  <dig> as a dual-specific akap  <cit> . mmgl also meets the three other criteria for classification as an akap: by verifying its interaction with its proposed binding partners, we demonstrate that the targeting domains contained within the proposed akap participates in protein-protein interactions  <cit> . further, it has previously been shown that mmgl is a phosphodiesterase 4d-interacting protein  <cit> , thus, it meets the criterion for being able to coordinate multiple signalling pathways by anchoring additional signalling enzymes  <cit> . lastly, we have shown in other y2h screens that cmybpc also binds to commd <dig> , here shown to be a mmgl interactor, while commd <dig> itself also binds to eno <dig> and snx <dig> . this strongly suggests that mmgl is part of a larger, multiprotein unit  <cit> , and that mmgl isoform  <dig> may function as a vital link in signaling between upstream activators and numerous downstream targets  <cit> .

co-compartmentalization of both pka and pde4d is crucial for maintaining specificity of adrenergic signaling, and for maintaining contractility in cardiac cells  <cit> . we here established an important and novel link between pka and pde4d co-compartmentalization at the sarcomere level, and cmybpc phosphorylation, and hence, regulation of cardiac contraction. the mechanism of docking of pka to cmybpc for phosphorylation of the mybpc motif has previously not been elucidated; this study strongly suggests that mmgl isoform  <dig> anchors pka to the n-terminal region, viz. c1-c <dig>  of cmybpc. the interaction between mmgl isoform  <dig>  pka, pde4d and the n-terminal region of cmybpc therefore sheds light on how second messenger responses are regulated in this particular part of the sarcomere.

we also found that β-adrenergic stimulation led to greater co-localization of myomegalin with both cmybpc and ctni in live cardiomyocytes, as evidenced by the increase in yellow staining during fluorescence microscopy in figures  <dig> & <dig>  respectively. thus, although mmgl is apparently present within the sarcomere under normal conditions, this implies that under adrenergic stimulation, and consequential increased intracellular levels of camp, pka is dynamically recruited by mmgl isoform  <dig> to distinct sarcomeric locations. this translocation of mmgl to the sarcomeric region is therefore compatible with a mechanism that would lead to increased phosphorylation of cmybpc and ctni, which is known to form part of the cardiac cellular stress response that leads to increased cardiac contraction  <cit> . furthermore, given mmgl's known interaction with pde4d  <cit> , the mechanism for termination of the second messenger response, by degrading camp, would also be on site; lower levels of camp may then cause this multiprotein complex to dissociate again.

the knockdown studies of mmgl further suggests that mmgl not only acts as an akap at the mybpc motif, but by implication plays a role in cardioprotection during adrenergic signaling. although, in the presence of mmgl, all phosphorylation isoforms of cmybpc are expressed well in h9c <dig> cells, and the level of the trisphosphorylated cmybpc is increased in such cells under conditions of β-adrenergic stimulation as is to be expected, knockdown of mmgl under adrenergic conditions dramatically reduced cmybpc expression . the latter finding suggests that when mmgl expression is reduced, cmybpc phosphorylation is hindered, rendering the protein vulnerable to cleavage by proteases and reducing cmybpc protein levels in the cell, as described by others  <cit> . typically, annulment of the effect of an akap is commonly more noticeable on the target protein only after adrenergic stimulation: for instance, the studies of mcconnell et al.   <cit>  and fink et al.   <cit>  showed no significant difference in the level of phosphorylation of key cardiac proteins between wild-type cardiomyocytes and those in which akap function had been impaired with the ht <dig> peptide. however, upon isoproterenol stimulation, dramatically decreased levels of pka phosphorylation of all these proteins was observed in ht31-transfected cells compared to isoproterenol-stimulated wild-type cells. fink et al.   <cit>  also demonstrated that akaps regulate phosphorylation of these pka targets, including ctni and cmybpc, in response to β-adrenergic stimulation, although it has been unknown which akap/s are responsible for the phosphorylation of these two proteins up until our study. thus, it appears that mmgl is an essential part in the β-adrenergic pathway leading to trisphosphorylation of cmybpc and protection of the protein against degradation and normal sarcomeric integrity, which in turn is essential for normal physiological cardiac function, as well as cardioprotection during ischemia-reperfusion injury  <cit> .

the subcellular localization and functions of some of the putative pka targets identified via the y2h library screen suggest that mmgl may act as akap in regions outside the sarcomere as well. although some of the identified interactions, such as those with cmybpc and ctni, certainly occur within the sarcomere, associations with the other identified interactors  do not necessarily occur within the sarcomere, nor do they necessarily all occur concurrently. in fact, a multiprotein subunit in the sarcomere consisting simultaneously of all identified mmgl-ligands would most likely sterically hinder crossbridge formation, and is therefore improbable. however, interaction of mmgl with proteins such as commd <dig>  carp, eno <dig> and eno <dig> may facilitate control of efficient pka phosphorylation of these proteins; the protein-protein interactions and/or activation of these proteins may thus be regulated.

although this study prioritized investigation of the interaction between the n-terminal of cmybpc and mmgl, the other putative interactions of this region of cmybpc should be further explored. the absence of cmybpc as a prey in the mmgl y2h library screen is most likely explained by the known absence of cdnas representing the n-terminals of large proteins in oligo dt-primed libraries, while the absence of prkar1a and prkar2a may relate to the stringency of selection during heterologous bait-matings during this y2h screen  <cit> .

interaction between myomegalin, pka and cmybpc or ctni is also relevant to understanding of hcm patho-aetiology, as both of the latter proteins cause hcm when defective. it is known that point mutations in the c1-c <dig> region and in the mybpc motif lead to hcm  <cit> ; a potential mechanism for this may be involve disruption of binding between mmgl and cmybpc. such disruption would have consequences for pka-phosphorylation of the cmybpc motif , implying a poison-peptide mechanism underlying disease, as well as maintenance of sufficient cmybpc levels within the sarcomere, particularly under conditions of adrenergic stress, implying a haplo-insufficiency mechanism. point mutations in ctni may have a similar patho-aetiology. it could be further speculated that, mutations in mmgl could similarly lead to inadequate binding of pka and/or its sarcomeric partners, which might affect cmybpc or ctni phosphorylation and hence affect adaptation of cardiac contractility to adrenergic stimulation. future studies could therefore consider mmgl as either a candidate causal gene or a potential modifier gene for hcm.

CONCLUSIONS
this study shows that myomegalin isoform  <dig> is a novel sarcomeric akap, which forms part of a multiprotein complex that functions in camp signalling. it is particularly relevant to phosphorylation of cmybpc and ctni, and therefore, is of significance in the regulation of cardiac contractility in both health and disease.
