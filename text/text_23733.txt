BACKGROUND
t cell mediated production of cytokines, such as tnf-alpha, interferon-gamma  and interleukin - <dig>  has been reported to influence the severity of dengue infection  <cit> . the mechanisms of t cell activation are mostly focused on the classical pathway, that is activation via binding of specific t cell receptors  and mhc molecules  <cit> . however, t cells may also be activated after stimulation by 'bystander' or tcr-independent signaling, for example by cytokines or novel activating receptors  <cit> . bystander t cell activation has been demonstrated in models of viral infection such as herpes simplex virus, lcmv and hiv leading to proliferation of memory t cells and subsequent production of cytokines, which can induce protection or pathology  <cit> . in addition to virus infection, our studies have identified ifn-γ producing bystander cd8+t cells in response to intracellular bacteria and showed that these t cells produced ifn-γ within  <dig> h  <cit> . the mechanism of bystander ifn-γ activation depends on pro-inflammatory cytokines, mainly il- <dig> and il- <dig>  <cit> .

dengue viral infection is the cause of dengue fever  and the more severe dengue hemorrhagic fever   <cit> . secondary infection by dengue virus of different serotypes to the primary infection in children aged less than  <dig> years is significantly associated with severe dhf  <cit> . previous studies have revealed that a storm of pro-inflammatory cytokines is released during acute infection  <cit> . these observations suggest that bystander t cell activation might possibly occur in dengue infection.

in this study, we aimed to investigate the existence of bystander t cell activation in healthy children living in endemic areas who might be vulnerable to reinfection with dengue virus and at risk of developing dhf  <cit> . we examined ifn-γ production, which is the established indicator for bystander t cell activation  <cit> , after restimulating with inactivated dengue viral antigens in vitro. bystander t cell activity was demonstrated by resistance to cyclosporin a , which is a substance known to inhibit t cell activation via the tcr-dependent pathway  <cit>  in addition, we described the kinetics of bystander t cells and cytokines involved in ifn-γ-derived t cell activation. the description of immune profiles in this study highlights bystander activation in natural dv infection of healthy people in an endemic area and emphasizes that the immune responses to dengue virus are more complex than anticipated.

RESULTS
healthy thai schoolchildren could produce ifn-γ in response to inactivated dengue virus serotype  <dig> in vitro
ifn-γ was selected for determination as a marker of bystander t cell function in this study. the mechanisms of ifn-γ production, triggered via tcr-dependent or independent pathways, were investigated by treatment with csa, which is known to inhibit t cells via a tcr-dependent pathway. blood samples from  <dig> healthy thai schoolchildren aged 13- <dig> years were co-cultured with control stimulators  and a combination of il- <dig> plus il- <dig> cytokines) or den <dig> in the absence or presence of csa for  <dig> h. the cultured supernatants were assayed for ifn-γ by sandwich elisa.

the positive control stimulators induced significantly higher ifn-γ than the medium control . in this study, the reduction of ifn-γ levels  was defined as csa sensitive or ifn-γ triggered via the tcr-dependent pathway, and csa resistant levels were defined as ifn-γ triggered via the tcr-independent pathway. as expected, in the control stimulation, ifn-γ induced by pha, but not il- <dig> plus il- <dig>  was significantly inhibited by csa treatment  indicating that csa sufficiently inhibited ifn-γ triggering via the tcr-dependent but not the cytokine receptor dependent pathway. interestingly, ifn-γ induced by den <dig> stimulation was also significantly inhibited by csa . moreover, the remaining ifn-γ levels after adding csa were also significantly higher than medium plus csa control .

inhibition by csa treatment in response to den <dig>  pha and il- <dig> plus il- <dig> stimulation was  <dig>  ±  <dig> % ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> %, respectively . these results implied that ifn-γ induction by den <dig> was mainly activated by the tcr-dependent pathway  and to a lesser degree by tcr-independent signaling .

to validate whether csa does indeed inhibit all tcr-stimulated ifn-γ activation, a mhc class i-restricted t cell epitope control of pooled peptides  of cytomegalovirus, epstein barr virus and influenza virus  was included in a small study with five whole blood samples from healthy school children stimulated with medium control, den <dig>  pha and cef in the presence or absence of  <dig>  μg/ml of csa. the results clearly showed that csa could completely inhibit ifn-γ induction by cef stimulation, but it partially inhibited ifn-γ induced by den <dig>  these results confirmed that csa could inhibit all ifn-γ production from tcr-dependent activation .

moreover, we have previously titrated csa concentration to test the ability of ifn-γ inhibition. ifn-γ induced by pha, which is the strongest ifn-γ stimulator, was inhibited by csa in a dose-dependent manner and maximum inhibition occurred at  <dig>  μg/ml of csa and remained constant at higher doses. this effect could be detected at time points  <dig> and  <dig> h after incubation . these results revealed that csa at this optimal concentration was able to inhibit t activation, via tcr-dependent activation, in both polyclonal and antigen-specific t cell activation.

identification of ifn-γ+ cells that responded to den2
to identify the types of immune cells that responded to dengue virus in the presence or absence of csa, the intracellular sources of ifn-γ were characterized by four-color flow cytometry. eighteen children who had strong ifn-γ responsiveness were followed up to determine the ifn-γ producing cells. the collected whole blood samples containing  <dig> ×  <dig> lymphocytes/ml were co-cultured with medium and  <dig> ha  units den <dig> for  <dig> h in the absence or presence of csa prior to cell staining.

in flow cytometric analysis, total cell populations were analyzed by side scatter and forward scatter plotting. then, the small lymphocyte population was first gated and shown as region r <dig>  total ifn-γ+ cells were then gated and shown as region r <dig> . the types of ifn-γ+ cells were then analyzed by the combination of tri-cd <dig>  fitc-cd <dig> and pe-cd <dig> or pe-cd <dig> and compared in the presence and absence of csa .

the results revealed that den <dig> stimulation induced total %ifn-γ+ cells significantly higher than medium controls, and approximately 43%  were inhibited by csa . adding csa resulted in the reduction of total %ifn-γ+ cells, and the proportions of ifn-γ+ lymphocyte subsets were slightly changed  by the decrease of natural killer  and increase of t cells. moreover, the results clearly demonstrated that some cd4+ and cd8+t cells resisted the effect of csa, suggesting that dengue virus induces bystander t cell activation in vitro .

the ifn-γ producing immune cell types in response to den <dig> stimulation consist of nk cells , cd4+t  and cd8+t  cells, respectively. interestingly, the distribution of csa resistant or bystander cd4+t cells ranged from  <dig> to 59%  and cd8+t cells ranged from  <dig> to 39% , respectively . of note, due to the shortage of blood samples in this experiment, only  <dig> of  <dig> blood samples were studied in the presence of csa and stained for nk cells. these results indicated that bystander  t cells and nk cells could contribute equally to the production of ifn-γ in responses to dengue virus in vitro.

the additional analysis of nk cell surface markers clearly demonstrated that cd3-cd56+cd16+ cells were also sources of ifn-γ  .

kinetics of bystander t and nk cell activation
to describe characteristic of activated bystander t cells, the kinetics of ifn-γ production of those bystander t cells were compared with innate nk cells and activated specific t cells. blood samples from seven schoolchildren were studied after  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h stimulation . the results revealed that ifn-γ+ cells could be detected as early as  <dig> h and most of seven samples showed similar kinetics of bystander cd4+, cd8+t and nk cells . one particular sample  showed a cd8+t predominant response with almost no cd4+ t cells. these results demonstrated the similar characteristics of bystander t cells in producing ifn-γ in addition to nk cells in response to dengue virus. in contrast to bystander cd4+ and cd8+t cells, specific cd4+ and/or cd8+t cells, were not detected as early as  <dig> h in five of seven samples  . the proportion of bystander and specific t cells from  <dig> samples, however, was equal after  <dig> h culture . taken together, these results indicated that innate immune cells  were rapidly induced in the early response and were followed by specific t cells to produce ifn-γ in response to dengue virus.

il-12-dependent pathway mediated t cell to produce ifn-γ
previously, proinflammatory cytokines such as il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> have been reported to elicit bystander t cells to produce ifn-γ  <cit> . to confirm that anti-cytokine neutralizing antibodies are, in fact, capable of inhibiting the cytokines at the concentrations used, the whole blood samples from healthy donors were treated with three-fold serial concentration of anti-il- <dig>  anti-il- <dig> and anti-il- <dig>  for  <dig> minutes before stimulation with heat-inactivated burkholderia pseudomallei, a strong bystander or cytokine-dependent t cell inducer as shown previously by our group. after  <dig> h, the cultured supernatants were harvested and examined for ifn-γ level by elisa. the results showed that all three anti-cytokine neutralizing antibodies could decrease ifn-γ induction by b. pseudomallei in a dose-dependent manner. therefore, the concentration of these antibodies at  <dig> μg/ml was used in the following den <dig> experiments .

to investigate these cytokines in ifn-γ production in response to dengue virus, the effects of neutralizing antibodies to these cytokines were investigated. eleven whole blood samples from healthy adult blood donors were studied by adding neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to human il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig>  and testing the culture supernatants for ifn-γ by elisa. the results revealed that adding anti-il- <dig>  but not anti-il- <dig> nor anti-il- <dig>  resulted in the statistically significant reduction of ifn-γ in response to dengue virus stimulation. these results revealed that ifn-γ was mainly activated by the il-12-dependent pathway. additionally, ifn-γ was completely inhibited by the combination of anti-il- <dig> and csa treatment suggesting synergistic effects of il-12-dependent and tcr-dependent pathways . three representative donors were then selected to characterize the intracellular sources of ifn-γ by flow cytometry using the protocol described above. the results showed that, as for the blood samples from children, the major ifn-γ producing cells were nk, cd4+t and cd8+t, respectively . additionally, the distribution of bystander vs. specific cd4+ or cd8+t cells was not significantly different . to determine effect of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies on the ifn-γ producing subpopulation, two representative samples were studied. results showed that anti-il- <dig> and csa could decrease ifn-γ producing cells derived from both cd4+ and cd8+t cells and the synergistic effect of the two pathways was also observed. cd4+t cells were equally sensitive to anti-il- <dig> and csa whereas cd8+t cells were less sensitive to anti-il- <dig> than csa . in contrast to t cells, nk cells were more sensitive to anti-il- <dig> than csa, as suggested in one case where nk cell markers were included and approximately 34% of ifn-γ production from nk cells was inhibited by csa, while anti-il- <dig> was able to inhibit ifn-γ production up to 75%. these results confirmed that there were bystander t cells that could produce ifn-γ via an il-12-dependent pathway in response to dengue infection.

discussion
in this study we first demonstrated that healthy thai schoolchildren could produce ifn-γ in response to dengue virus serotype  <dig>  which is the predominant serotype and the major cause of dhf  <cit> . then, we highlighted the major finding that bystander cd4+ t and cd8+ t cells responding to dengue virus could account for approximately 50% of immune components producing ifn-γ via the tcr-independent pathway as demonstrated by their resistance to csa . the contribution of these innate and/or adaptive immune components was demonstrated by the study of time kinetics, and the results clearly showed that the kinetics of bystander t cells were similar to those of nk cells and, in most cases, were in contrast to specific t cells. these results suggest a key function of innate immunity composed of nk and bystander t cells in rapid responses to control early dengue virus infection.

determination of bystander t cell activation by using csa treatment has been previously used by our group and others  <cit> . moreover, the studies using neutralizing antibodies for il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  <cit> , or blocking antibodies for their receptors  <cit>  has confirmed that bystander t cells and nk cells could be activated by these cytokines. our studies clearly demonstrated that there were cd4+ and cd8+ t cells resistant to csa treatment in healthy children's blood samples responding to dengue virus. these bystander t cells were strongly activated via an il-12-dependent pathway as demonstrated by neutralization of anti-il- <dig> but not anti-il- <dig> or anti-il- <dig>  additionally, no synergistic action between il- <dig> and il- <dig> or il- <dig> could be observed suggesting that the activation of t cells via il- <dig> alone was sufficient to produce ifn-γ. paganin et al. have reported that il- <dig> alone primes both cd4+ and cd8+t clones for high ifn-γ production, and the principle mechanism is the ability to prime t cells during th <dig> clonal expansion  <cit> . in addition to il- <dig> alone, t cells also secrete ifn-γ in a tcr-independent manner after stimulation with the pro-inflammatory cytokines; il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> or the synergistic actions of il- <dig> and either il- <dig> or il- <dig>  <cit> . however, csa could inhibit some ifn-γ producing nk cells. this unexpected effect of csa on nk cells has also been demonstrated by wang et al. the co-culture of peripheral blood nk cells subpopulations with csa can decrease proliferation of cd56dim nk cells  but not cd56bright nk cells   <cit> . our studies have shown that cd56dim nk cells produced ifn-γ in cell culture. therefore, csa might affect this nk cell subpopulation.

in addition, cd16-cd56+ nk cells, cd3-cd56+cd16+ nk cells, cd3+cd56+ nkt cells, cd3-cd8+ cells and cd3-cd4+ cells were also found to produce ifn-γ in this study. azeredo et al., have shown the increase of cd3-cd56+cd16+ , cd3+cd56+  during acute dengue infection  <cit> . our findings supported the idea that those cells could respond by ifn-γ production against dengue virus at least in an il-12-dependent manner. it has also been reported that nk cells control early dengue virus infection via antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity  <cit> . in light of recent evidence, the barrier between innate and adaptive immunity seems to be blurred  <cit> ; our study offers the possibility of investigating this novel concept of host immunity in dengue infection.

one study of immune responses of volunteers who had received the live attenuated monovalent dengue vaccines reported that restimulating memory cd4+ t cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells with homologous inactivated dengue serotype resulted in the highest ifn-γ production whereas stimulation with heterologous serotypes resulted in the alteration of ifn-γ to tnf-alpha production  <cit> . another study from the same group reported that dengue virus-reactive cd8+t cells showed differences in both proliferation and cytokine production responding to heterologous viral serotypes. restimulation of these cd8+ t cells with dengue serotype  <dig> variant of ns4b epitope  <dig> and dengue  <dig> variant of ns4a epitope  <dig> resulted in the greatest cytokine production  <cit> . moreover, mongkolsapaya et al. have reported that cross-reactive dengue specific cd8+ t cells seemed to show suboptimal degranulation but also high ifn-γ and tnf-alpha production  <cit> . these results implied that specific t cell responses might lead to high levels of ifn-γ production whereas cross-reactive t cell responses alter cytokine profiles and contribute to disease severity. in respect of our studies, ifn-γ induced by den <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were also investigated. however, the ifn-γ induced by these antigens was much less than den <dig> stimulation. these results might reflect the activation of den2-specific t cells. however, relative contribution of specific vs. cross-reactive vs. bystander t cells to immunopathogenesis of dengue infection requires further investigation.

nevertheless, the pre-existing immunity which protects or increases disease severity during secondary infection has not been well defined. the previous prospective study of thai schoolchildren has revealed that the higher degree of activation of pre-existing ifn-γ responding to any of the four serotypes correlated with the subsequent hospitalization of children aged 7- <dig> years  <cit> . the ifn-γ induction in our study generally showed higher levels than the previous study of mangada et al.; this could be due to the fact that all cellular functions in our study were performed in whole blood samples freshly collected within  <dig> h to avoid any decreased activities by the cryopreservation process of frozen samples. in addition, among  <dig> healthy school children in this study,  <dig> were seronegative and  <dig> were seropositive for igg anti-dengue antibody. however, bystander ifn-γ production from these two populations was not different. thus the degree of total or bystander ifn-γ production may be further studied as a potential predictor for dhf of sufficient severity to require hospitalization.

this study focused on bystander ifn-γ production in responses to inactivated dengue viral antigens in vitro using the same dengue viral preparation as for currently available commercial antibody assays. unfortunately, a non-infected control from the same commercial source was not available for confirmation of antigen specific activation. since it was prepared from suckling mouse brain, no animal laboratories could provide the control brain tissues without a proper license. thus, ifn-γ induced by another source of inactivated antigens, cultured supernatants of c6/ <dig> mosquito cells infected with dengue viral serotype  <dig> , was compared instead . inactivated culture supernatants of mock-infected c6/ <dig> cell lines showed no ifn-γ induction and the inactivated supernatants of den2-infected c6/ <dig> cells could stimulate cells to produce ifn-γ to higher levels than the medium control. much less ifn-γ was induced by inactivated cultured supernatants than by mouse extracts. however, regression analysis of ifn-γ induced by two antigens showed that bystander but not specific ifn-γ levels were correlated . these results strongly supported the observation that dengue antigens could trigger bystander ifn-γ production in vitro.

CONCLUSIONS
we have defined the bystander activation of t cells in responses to dengue infection, mediated by il-12-dependent pathways existing in healthy thai schoolchildren. these bystander t cells play a major contribute to the ifn-γ production in response to dengue virus in vitro. these immunological responses may be involved in immunopathogenesis of dengue hemorrhagic fever and provide basic information on immune cell profiles in children living in endemic areas with potential use for dengue vaccine development.
