BACKGROUND
members of the genus rickettsia are obligate intracellular, gram-negative, bacteria. these bacteria are surrounded by a crystalline proteic layer  <cit> , also referred to as s-layer, which represents  <dig> to  <dig> % of their total protein mass  <cit>  and is made of immunodominant surface protein antigens   <cit> . prior to rickettsia genome sequencing, two spas, i.e. rompa  <cit>  and rompb  <cit> , were identified in rickettsia species. these two high molecular weight proteins are major antigenic determinants eliciting an early and dominant immune response in patients infected with rickettsiae  <cit> . recent studies suggested that these two proteins are involved in adhesion to host cells  <cit> . this assumption is supported by the presence of conserved repeated peptide motifs which are common in some adhesive proteins from other species  <cit> .

rompa and rompb are encoded by the ompa  <cit>  and sca <dig>   <cit>  genes, respectively. sequence analyses readily identify the presence of a highly conserved autotransporter β-barrel domain  at the c-termini of the protein products. proteins carrying this domain are collectively designated as "autotransporter proteins", and have been described in many gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . the autotransporter domain forms a β-barrel pore in the bacterial outer membrane, and allows the amino-terminal part  of the precursor to be exported across the outer membrane of the bacterium, and later be released following cleavage of the autotransporter domain. theoretical molecular masses of the predicted proteins derived from ompa and ompb genes exceed those experimentally measured for rompa and rompb, respectively  <cit> , implying the cleavage of the autotransporter domain from their precursors. indeed, such a post-translational processing was demonstrated for rompb for which a ≈30-kda peptide is cleaved from the c-terminus of the protein  <cit> . another gene, annotated as sca <dig> , previously named gene d  <cit>  and known to encode a 120-kda intracytoplasmic protein, has a passenger domain similar to those of ompa and ompb. however, it lacks the autotransporter domain  <cit> .

based on the sequences of nine rickettsia genomes, we have recently identified another  <dig> autotransporter genes exhibiting structures similar to those of ompa and ompb  <cit> . members of the paralogous sca gene family are diversely degraded and distributed among rickettsia species, with numbers of complete genes ranging from two in r. prowazekii to  <dig> in r. felis  <cit> . among the  <dig> sca genes, only three are present in all nine rickettsia genomes, i.e., sca <dig>  sca <dig>  and sca <dig> . however, we have previously demonstrated that sca <dig> was not amplified in r. canadensis  <cit>  and that sca <dig> was fragmented in r. prowazekii and not amplifiable in r. canadensis  <cit> . as a consequence, none of the previously studied sca genes, despite their demonstrated usefulness for identification of these bacteria, may serve to identify all rickettsial isolates. likewise, no current phylogenetic study based on sca genes included all rickettsia species.

of the  <dig> rickettsial autotransporter proteins putatively encoded by the  <dig> sca genes, only rompa and rompb have been detected by sds-page or western-blotting in r. conorii  <cit>  as well as sca <dig> in r. japonica  <cit> . curiously, neither ompa nor ompb are conserved in all validated rickettsia species, despite their seemingly important roles in adhesion to host cells  <cit> . no protein product has been identified yet for the other sca genes, raising the question as to whether those genes are functional. by rt-pcr, we recently observed that sca <dig> was transcribed in r. conorii  <cit> . in this study, to further characterize the sca family of genes, we studied the sca <dig> gene, the only gene together with ompb and sca <dig> present in the nine rickettsia genomes  <cit> . by comparing sca <dig> gene sequences from all  <dig> validated rickettsia species, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of rickettsia species and analyzed more precisely the evolutionary forces that acted on sca <dig>  in addition, as ompb and sca <dig> are expressed, we also examined the transcriptional status of the sca <dig> gene in r. conorii.

RESULTS
sca <dig> sequences
orthologous genes of the r. conorii sca <dig> gene in the genomes of r. prowazekii, r. typhi, and r. felis, were readily identified with the use of blastn, tblastn, and blastp homology searches. in r. prowazekii, the sca <dig> gene was split into three consecutive orfs .

sca <dig> fragments were amplified from all tested rickettsia species. all negative controls remained negative. the size of sca <dig> genes ranged from  <dig>  bp for r. bellii to  <dig>  bp for r. japonica. all studied species exhibited distinct sca <dig> sequences, which were deposited in genbank under the accession numbers reported in table  <dig>  the global pairwise nucleotide sequence identities of sca <dig> varied from 57% between r. prowazekii and r. canadensis to  <dig> % between r. sibirica and r. parkeri. this variation is greater than that observed for the  <dig> s rdna  and glta genes , previously studied for all rickettsia species  <cit> . this variation is also greater than that observed for sca <dig>  which exhibits pairwise identities ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  %  <cit> . thus sca <dig> appeared to be more divergent at the nucleotide level among rickettsia species than sca <dig>  the g+c% of sca <dig> sequences ranged from  <dig>  % for r. prowazekii to  <dig>  % for r. helvetica. differences among rickettsia species consisted of nucleotide substitutions, insertions and deletions, but not of variations in number of repeats as observed in ompa  <cit> . insertions and/or deletions were found in all studied species and varied in size and position according to the species. when translated into amino acids, sca <dig> sequences were free from internal stop codons except r. prowazekii and r. canadensis. the overall pairwise amino acid sequence identities ranged from  <dig> % between r. canadensis and r. bellii to 97% between r. conorii and r. sibirica.

using the svarap software, we identified a 488-bp fragment at the 3'-end of the sca <dig> gene, in the autotransporter domain. with regard to the r. japonica sca <dig> sequence, this fragment was located between nucleotides  <dig>  and  <dig> . it was flanked by conserved sequences within which it was possible to identify the primer pair f1max: 5'-aagaggtytrtggatgcgt-3' and rmax: 5'-gayaatatattattytctttc-3'. the specificity of these primers was confirmed by comparison with sequences available in the genbank database. each of the  <dig> rickettsia species we studied had a specific fragment sequence, with pairwise nucleotide sequence identities varying from  <dig> % between r. belli and r. prowazekii to  <dig>  % between r. parkeri and r. africae. fragment sequences were deposited in genbank under the accession numbers reported in table  <dig> 

phylogenetic analysis
the phylogenetic relationships among rickettsia species were inferred in three steps. because the passenger domains of the sca <dig> proteins could not be aligned reliably owing to a high level of divergence between distant rickettsia species, we first reconstructed the phylogeny of the  <dig> species from the alignment of the autotransporter domains, which is much more conserved. the autotransporter domain alignment contained  <dig> amino acid sites. in this phylogenetic tree , the three major recognized rickettsia clades  were well separated with bootstrap value >75%. in addition, r. canadensis appeared to form a separate fourth deep branching clade. the spotted fever sub-tree was poorly resolved, with most branches having bootstrap values <75%. we realigned separately the sca <dig> proteins from spotted fever group  rickettsiae, including the passenger domain, and used them for phylogenetic reconstruction. after removing gaps and ambiguous positions, the sfg alignment contained  <dig> amino acid sites and  <dig> sequences. the sfg tree  was organized in three distinct clades. the first clade included r. felis, r akari, and r. australis; the second clade contained a single species, i.e., r. helvetica. the last clade contained all other sfg species, including r. conorii. this latter clade, poorly resolved, was therefore re-analysed separately. the alignment of the sca <dig> proteins from the latter clade contained  <dig> sequences and  <dig>  amino acid sites after gap removal. the resulting phylogenetic tree was entirely resolved with all branches supported with bootstrap values > 82%, except for the placement of r. honei with a boostrap support of 53% . two clusters supported by bootstrap values of 100% were observed, one including r. massiliae, r. rhipicephali, r. aeschlimannii and r. montanensis, and the other including all remaining species.

study of evolutionary forces
we carried out a sliding window analysis to highlight the local variations of sequence similarity along the protein sequences. two broad regions with different levels of sequence divergence could be distinguished . the first region, which encompasses the majority of the alignment , is characterized by a higher level of sequence divergence with  <dig> aa window not exceeding 86% of invariable positions and dropping at values as low as 60% at positions 127– <dig> and 325– <dig> . the second region from position  <dig> to the end, overlaps with the autotransporter domain and is more conserved with  <dig> aa window ranging from 78% to 98% of invariable positions. this heterogeneity of sequence divergence suggests different strength of selective constraints in the different domains of the sca <dig> protein.

to further characterize the variations of selective constraints along the sca <dig> protein sequence, models of codon substitutions were fitted to the aligned sca <dig> codon sequences to estimate the ω ratios . likelihood ratio tests were applied between nested models to select the one that best described the data . models m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig>  which account for variable ω ratio among codon sites are all significantly better  than model m <dig>  which accounts for a single ω ratio for all codon sites in the alignment. this confirms that selective constraints are not homogenous along the sca <dig> sequences. in addition, model m <dig>  significantly improved the likelihood over model m <dig> . interestingly, models m <dig> and m <dig> both predicted a class of codon sites with ω >  <dig>  suggesting that some amino acid positions are under positive selection. this result was further confirmed by the model m <dig>  which better fit the data than model m <dig> and predicted an additional class of codons with ω =  <dig> . note that model m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig> identified the same amino acid positions under positive selection. thus, the signal for positive selection was consistent whatever the evolutionary model considered . the predicted positively selected sites were mainly distributed within the internal passenger domain  except site  <dig>  which fall in the at domain. unfortunately, little is known about the sca <dig> passenger domain and no information is available on the 3-dimensional proximity of the positively selected sites. the c-terminal region encompassing the autotransporter domain was globally under stronger purifying selection . models m <dig> and m <dig> predicted that 44% and 45% of codon sites respectively  belong to codon categories with ω close to or higher than  <dig>  this suggests that a substantial fraction of amino acid sites in the passenger domain of sca <dig> proteins was under weak or positive selection. when estimating the ka/ks ratios by branch, we observed that the ratios were >  <dig> among sfg rickettsiae but <  <dig> between r. prowazekii and r. typhi, thus suggesting a different evolutionary pressure that acted on sca <dig> in sfg and typhus group rickettsiae.

rt-pcr assay
an rt-pcr product of 407-bp was obtained from r. conorii. negative controls remained negative. the sequenced rt-pcr product was 100% identical to the sca <dig> sequence from r. conorii.

discussion
we studied the sca <dig> gene in the  <dig> currently validated rickettsia species and demonstrated that this gene, the only sca gene present in all  <dig> species , is a useful tool for the identification and phylogenetic study of these bacteria.

we obtained unique sca <dig> sequences for each of the  <dig> studied species. we also observed that sca <dig> sequences exhibit a greater level of interspecies variablity than previously studied sca genes, thus making sca <dig> a potential identification tool for rickettsiae.sca <dig> loci exhibit diverse levels of conservation among rickettsia species. it is present as a complete gene in all studied species except in r. prowazekii and r. canadensis, in which it is present as a pseudogene. amiri et al. have previously demonstrated that the rate of gene degradation may vary among rickettsia species, with typhus group rickettsiae exhibiting a higher rate than spotted fever group rickettsiae  <cit> . in our study, we observed a higher degradation gradient in typhus group  than in spotted fever group rickettsiae . we have previously observed such variations for ompa, sca <dig>  sca <dig>  and sca <dig> . ompa is present as a pseudogene in r. felis and r. akari, as fragments in r. bellii  <cit> , and could not be amplified in r. helvetica, r. canadensis, and typhus group rickettsiae  <cit> ; sca <dig> is present as a pseudogene in r. helvetica and r. canadensis, and as remnants in typhus group rickettsiae  <cit> ; sca <dig> was split in r. prowazekii and could not be detected in r. canadensis  <cit> ; and sca <dig> was not found in r. canadensis  <cit> . all other sca genes are even less conserved among rickettsia species  <cit> . thus, sca <dig> is the only sca family gene to be present in all  <dig> validated rickettsia species. this specificity and the length of the gene prompted us to search for a gene fragment that could serve as an identification tool for all species. we identified a 488-bp fragment within the autotransporter domain whose sequence could distinguish all rickettsia species. this sequence fragment has the advantage of being amplified using a single primer pair , and thus may be a useful tool for both detection and identification of rickettsia species.

due to high levels of divergence between distant rickettsia species in their passenger domains, we based our phylogenetic analysis on a polyphasic approach. the sca1-based phylogenetic analysis of rickettsia species was well supported for most species . four clusters were identified and supported by elevated bootstrap values: one included the rickettsia species previously classified within the r. rickettsii group  <cit> ; a second was made of members of the r. massiliae group; a third incorporated members of the r. akari group; and the fourth group was made of members of the typhus group. by comparison with previous phylogenetic studies based on autotransporter genes or glta, involved in a central metabolic pathway  <cit> , we obtained similar organizations among sfg rickettsiae. obtaining similar phylogenetic reconstructions from the analyses of different genes with different functions suggests that the true phylogenetic organization of members of the rickettsia genus is close to that obtained in our study.

by comparing sca genes among nine rickettsia genomes, we have previously observed that five of the  <dig> sca genes  have evolved under positive selection  <cit> . however, this analysis was global and based on a limited number of species. herein, we conducted a detailed study using a sliding-window approach. this method showed that sca <dig> is divided into two domains undergoing different selection pressure . the 3'-end of the gene, highly conserved among species and encoding the autotransporter domain, was found to evolve under purifying selection. this is likely due to the complex structure of the β barrel pore, which involves numerous specific interactions between amino acids. amino acid replacements in the autotransporter domain may be more likely to be deleterious for the protein function. in contrast, the 5'-part of the gene, highly variable among species and encoding the secreted part of the protein, has evolved under weaker or neutral selection. in addition, we have shown here that some amino acid positions within the n-terminal domain have evolved under positive selection. the immune system of the host is known to drive positive darwinian selection for diversity of immuno-exposed proteins such as the porb gene of neisseria gonorrhoeae  <cit> . to date, only the rompa, rompb, and sca <dig> proteins have evidence of expression and are known to induce an immune response in humans  <cit> . the functional status of the other sca genes is still uncertain. several features of sca <dig> evolution suggest that this gene is functional in most of the rickettsia species belonging to the spotted fever group. first, if the process of degradation started before the separation of these species, we would expect the level of divergence to be homogeneous along the protein sequences. the fact that we could distinguish two regions with different levels of sequence divergence argues against the pseudogene hypothesis. in addition, the genic region corresponding to the autotransporter domain appeared to evolve mainly under purifying selection, which is characteristic of functional coding sequences. in addition, we observed that sca <dig> has evolved under distinct evolutionary patterns depending on the phylogenetic branches. in typhus group rickettsiae, sca <dig> has evolved under purifying selection whereas in other species, it has evolved under positive selection. whether this is linked to a difference in vector or host is unknown.

although sca <dig>  sca <dig> and sca <dig> are the most conserved sca genes among rickettsia species , only the latter two genes are known to be expressed. thus, we investigated the transcription of this gene, which is currently unknown. chao et al. could not find sca <dig> in the r. prowazekii proteome  <cit> . however, this may be explained by the fact that sca <dig> is a pseudogene in this species. using rt-pcr, we demonstrated that sca <dig> was transcribed at least in r. conorii. the molecular mass of the predicted mature sca <dig> protein in r. conorii being  <dig> kda, which is close to that of rompa, it is possible that the expression of sca <dig> has not been detected previously because of the lack of resolution of sds-page analyses. future efforts will be put to determine whether the transcription of sca <dig> is followed by its translation into a protein.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated that the sca <dig> gene, which encodes a putative autotransporter protein, is the only sca gene present in all rickettsia species. we identified a 488-bp variable sca <dig> fragment amplifiable using a pair of conserved primers that may be used as a detection and identification tool for rickettsia species. phylogenetic relationships obtained from the analysis of this gene are consistent with those obtained from the analyses of other genes, thus suggesting that this gene is undergoing similar evolutionary constraints. the sca <dig> gene, which is partially degraded in certain species, is undergoing a dual selection pressure and is transcribed into mrna in r. conorii, thus suggesting that it might be functional. however, as its putative protein product has not been detected as yet, further studies should aim at determining whether it plays a role in the immune response observed in patients with rickettsioses.
