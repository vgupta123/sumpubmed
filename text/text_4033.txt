BACKGROUND
to date, several high-throughput hla typing methods using next-generation sequencing  have been developed . in our previous study, we completely sequenced long-range pcr amplicons encompassing entire regions of each of the hla genes . pcr amplicons were subjected to transposase-based library construction and multiplex sequencing with the miseq sequencer. paired-end reads of  <dig> ×  <dig> bp enabled us to demonstrate phase-defined allele determination  in  <dig> hla homozygous samples,  <dig> hla heterozygous samples, and  <dig> parent–child families. our sequencing protocol and pipeline provided essentially complete phase-defined hla gene sequences; however, it required complicated and labor-intensive workflows especially in the library preparation step. most importantly, the method is not well adapted for processing multiple samples. in the present study, we developed a new library preparation method for ngs and applied it to  <dig> samples. long-range pcr products of hla-b spanning from promoters to 3′-utrs were prepared and sequenced with the miseq sequencer via transposase-based library preparation. in the previous protocol, although the dna amount of each library was strictly measured and the library size was validated using a bioanalyzer before the sequencing step, it was difficult to equalize the dna amount and molecular size of the libraries, resulting in variable numbers of reads in each sample. we observed dropouts of samples owing to insufficient reads. here, we developed a bead-based normalization for uniform sequencing  procedure using three steps of bead purification. benus can easily and precisely normalize the molar concentrations of up to  <dig> samples, not only simplifying the library preparation step but also permitting automation of hla typing using ngs.

RESULTS
pcr amplification of hla-band library preparation
we applied long-range pcr to amplify hla-b, which is known to be highly polymorphic. hla-b-specific amplification products were obtained from  <dig> individuals. all  <dig> pcr amplicons were subjected to transposase-based library construction using the nextera kit, which simultaneously fragments the dna and adds adaptors needed for multiplex sequencing. we developed protocol steps using altered ampure xp beads to normalize the molar concentrations of  <dig> samples. each pcr amplicon was subjected separately to transposase-based library construction, whereby a sample-specific index was introduced. the nextera kit can construct libraries of a broad size range. for phase-defined hla sequencing, a library range of 500– <dig>  bp is desirable. in the previous protocol  <cit> , the library size selection was achieved by cutting of agarose gel and checking using a bioanalyzer, which is a very laborious step, especially for preparing multiple samples.

our new method, benus, which is described in detail in the methods section, circumvents the gel cutting method and employs bead-based steps for library size selection as well as equalization of dna molar concentrations in up to  <dig> samples. more specifically, three bead steps were performed: first,  <dig> μl of altered beads suspended in 20% peg and  <dig>  m nacl solution was added to  <dig> μl of diluted pcr product, and the supernatant fraction containing the desired fragments  was collected. second,  <dig> μl of beads was added to the collected supernatant. desired fragments of larger than  <dig> bp were bound to the beads, while smaller fragments remaining in the supernatant were discarded . after these two steps, the desired dna fragments  were selected  . finally, 20-fold diluted beads were added to the size-fractionated library. small numbers of beads can bind saturated amounts of dna because bound dna is in proportion to the number of beads . eventually, the final dna size, concentration, and thereby molar concentration were equalized .figure  <dig> 
schematic workflow of benus. the benus method was constructed using two categories of method, size selection  and normalization of dna amount .  size selection using altered ampure xp beads. for size selection, two different bead ratio conditions were applied according to dna volume:  <dig> × bead ratio for < <dig>  bp fragment size and  <dig> × bead ratio for > <dig> bp. after bead selection, dna fragments ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp were bound to the beads.  normalization of dna amount using altered ampure xp beads dna fragments with target sizes ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp were selected for effective hla gene haplotype phasing. the size selection and dna amount also defined an actual molar concentration for bridge pcr to generate clusters in a flow cell, because dna fragments of over  <dig>  bp are not efficiently amplified. only one bead reaction condition was applied to normalize the amount of dna. this step enables a defined amount of dna to be bound to the diluted beads. this step enables a defined amount of dna to be bound to the diluted beads.



complete sequencing of hla-bfor  <dig> samples
the nextera-treated libraries from  <dig> hla-b pcr amplicons were subjected to ngs sequencing. the distribution of reads among the  <dig> multiplexed indexes ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> % as percentages of  <dig>  million reads and  <dig>  Â±  <dig> % on average. technical improvements in libraries preparation were clarified by comparison between our previous method, cutting of agarose gel followed by the bioanalyzer, and benus method. the distribution of respective read numbers by the previous method was  <dig> % to  <dig> % and the value by benus method was  <dig>  to  <dig> % . sequence reads of hla-b, were aligned to the reference sequence at an average mapped rate of  <dig> %, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> %. the average depth of the alignment before phasing was  <dig> × and the phased haplotype depth was  <dig> ×. of the  <dig> samples, heterozygous snvs and indels were not observed in  <dig> samples  indicating completely homozygous haplotypes. generally, miseq yields base errors at a rate of  <dig> % with pcr free library preparation  <cit> . in the result of these homozygous samples, the total error rate of sequencing reaction and pcr amplification was estimated to be as less than  <dig> %. in our simulated alignment result, the maximum error rates in 300× and 200× average depth were  <dig> % and 6%, respectively, and the minimum depth for complete phasing was approximately 800× average depth. we recognize phasing result is not only dependent on average depth but also on distance between two heterozygous snvs and long insert library covering the two heterozygous snvs. as a general method, we propose that sequence reads of at least 800× depth is valid for providing the phase-defined hla sequences with for high accuracy . all samples were completely phased by the phase-defined sequencing pipeline  <cit> , although six samples showed only  <dig> to  <dig> snvs in one exon: samples  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> had  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> heterozygous snvs in exon  <dig>  respectively. sample  <dig> had  <dig> heterozygous snvs in exon  <dig>  whereas sample  <dig> had one heterozygous snv in exon  <dig> . all the above samples were also phased using partial phasing . allelic imbalance as a result of pcr is manifested by skewed allelic calls after hla sequencing. allelic imbalance of the pcr amplification of hla-b was negligible, as judged by the ratio of sequencing depth between the two phased alignments; 1: <dig>  at the maximum and 1: <dig>  on average in heterozygous samples . consequently,  <dig> haplotype sequences of  <dig> individuals, which include  <dig> different haplotype sequences, were constructed as phased allelic hla-b sequences. in general, allelic imbalance after pcr amplification has been occasionally observed. evidently, this problem is not specific to ngs analyses. if capture, ngs, or the analytical step are causes of allelic imbalance, we would observe the discrepancy between our ngs typing and sso typing, which was not the case in the current study. the current protocol aimed at minimizing the disparity of each sample; this was achieved although not perfectly. the minimum depth could be important to obtain phase-defined sequences because lower depth could leave unphased region. however, complete phase-defined sequencing is dependent on the allelic type of the sample, thereby it is not easy to give an exact depth number to accomplish the sequencing in general. in the current study, the most important point of the current study was to obtain complete phase-defined sequences of  <dig> samples without any dropout, which was achieved using the current protocol.figure  <dig>

*phase defined sequencing pipeline.

after obtaining phase-defined hla gene sequences for  <dig> haplotype sequences, we attempted to assign hla allele numbers to these sequences by searching for known allele sequences in the imgt/hla database. we used phased hla-b haplotype sequences that spanned all of the intronic and exonic regions as queries against genomic and cds sequences in the database. the determined hla-b allele calls in all samples were consistent with pcr-sso and omixon target, although the pcr-sso determined hla allele numbers were limited to a 4-digit resolution.

CONCLUSIONS
we established a simple, high-throughput, high-resolution, and high-fidelity hla sequencing and genotyping method, as a combination of the nextera kit and our new benus method. we successfully applied our method for hla-b sequencing in  <dig> samples, without dropouts. by developing benus, it becomes feasible to construct multi-libraries without agarose gel size selection and dna density control of each library. this method would be greatly advantageous for clinical applications that require a user-friendly and cost-effective protocol, with high throughput and accuracy. our protocols open a way to prepare ngs libraries for large-scale hla gene sequencing and typing using an automated system.
