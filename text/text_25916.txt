BACKGROUND
micrornas  are small, non-coding regulatory rnas that affect gene expression by partial complementary pairing with target mrnas  <cit> . transcribed from genomic dna, pri-mirnas containing a long hairpin are further processed in the nucleus to the pre-mirna. then, after maturation in the cytoplasm they can exert their function leading to translational repression and/or mrna destabilization and degradation. these small rnas are synthesized in a multi-step process that involves several specific proteins and enzymes  <cit> . first, pri-mirnas are processed by a drosha/dgcr <dig> microprocessor complex subunit into 70–100 nt hairpin/stem-loop precursors . once exported from the nucleus by exportin- <dig> , pre-mirnas are cleaved by dicer <dig> to produce ~22 nt-long mirna/mirna* dimers. final maturation of mirnas and their proper functioning require assembly of a set of proteins/enzymes known as risc . dicer <dig> and its protein partners, hiv- <dig> transactivation response , rna- binding protein  <dig> , a trinucleotide repeat containing 6a , and members of the argonaute  family, are the main components of this complex. although the generally-accepted mechanism assumes that only a guide strand is incorporated into the risc and the opposite strand, known as mirna*  is degraded, there is evidence that the latter can also be functional  <cit> . finally, mature mirnas guide argonaute-containing complexes to target sites mainly in the 3’utr region of the given transcript, which inhibits gene expression. recent deep sequencing studies found that mirnas exist as populations of variants  of different lengths and nucleotide composition  <cit> .

studies in rodents  and in humans  <cit>  have demonstrated characteristic expression patterns of mirnas in the pregnant uterus, implicating them not only in proper progression of pregnancy but also in implantation defects or spontaneous fetal loss. chakrabarty et al.  <cit>  showed that during the peri-implantation period in mice, expression of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase  <dig> , an enzyme crucial for prostaglandin  synthesis, is regulated by mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir-199a*. xia et al.  <cit>  proved that activated blastocysts may influence endometrial expression of mir- <dig> during implantation in rats, while wang et al.  <cit>  provided evidence that mir-133a causes recurrent spontaneous abortion by reducing hla-g expression in humans. recently, wessels et al.  <cit>  using microarrays demonstrated differential patterns of canonical mirna expression in the pregnant and non-pregnant uterus, as well as in normal or arrested trophoblasts on day  <dig> of pregnancy in pigs. applying the same technique, su and co-workers  <cit>  analyzed mirna expression in the porcine endometrium during embryo implantation , placentation  and in mid-gestation , showing that some canonical mirnas targeted the well-studied genes which are critical for placenta development in pigs.

although a growing number of reports describe tissue- and time-specific mirna expression in the pregnant and cyclic uterus in different species, there is still a lack of precise data about the endometrial profile of canonical and non-canonical mirnas during the crucial periods of maternal recognition of pregnancy  and embryo implantation  in pigs. therefore, identification of mirnas as well as characterization of specific mirna-mrna interactions in the porcine endometrium is of great importance for understanding the role of these molecules in porcine reproduction. in the present study, by employing illumina deep sequencing, we identified hundreds of mirna sequences and their isomirs, which by regulating their putative target genes may play a role during early pregnancy in the pig. since generally rarer, 5’ end polymorphic isomirs may represent a significant proportion of the population of some mirnas we investigated in vitro whether 5’ isomir of mir-140-3p with shifted seed is indeed capable of conferring differential targeting recognition and thus has different functions in the porcine luminal endometrium. moreover, time- and reproductive status-specific changes in the expression profiles of ten synthesis/transport-related genes were evaluated in order to identify characteristic patterns of mirna biosynthesis regulation.

RESULTS
expression of mirna biosynthesis/transport related genes in the porcine endometrium
expression of analyzed genes  was assessed relatively to the geometric mean of the most stable genes – actb and ppib . the mrna expression of drosha was affected by day  and reproductive status . the highest drosha level in the cycle was observed on d <dig>  and then decreased slightly reaching the lowest levels on d <dig> . during pregnancy, mrna level for this gene was higher on d <dig> and on d <dig> . in almost all within a day comparisons expression of drosha was greater in cyclic than pregnant endometria  except day  <dig> where comparable levels were observed. dgcr <dig> expression was affected by day , but not the reproductive status . mrna level of this gene was the highest on d <dig> of pregnancy in comparison to other days , as well when compared to the corresponding day of the estrous cycle . in contrast, it was maintained lower on d <dig> of pregnancy . expression of xpo <dig> was significantly different between analyzed days  and dependent on reproductive status . in cyclic animals, the highest xpo <dig> mrna level was observed on d <dig> . high level of this gene was also noted on d <dig> when compared to d <dig> and d <dig> . on d <dig> and d <dig>  higher xpo <dig> mrna expression was noted in cyclic vs. pregnant animals . during pregnancy xpo <dig> expression was maintained at comparable levels except significant decrease on d <dig> . dicer <dig> expression was affected by reproductive status  but not day . during the estrous cycle mrna level of this gene was maintained at similar level. however, in pregnant animals mrna expression of dicer <dig> was increased on d <dig> vs. d <dig> . tarbp <dig> level was affected by day  and reproductive status . in endometria from cyclic animals expression of this gene was higher on d <dig> vs. d <dig>  and vs. d <dig> . during pregnancy, tarbp <dig> expression was maintained high on d <dig> when compared to other days of pregnancy . significantly lower expression of this gene was observed on d <dig> and d <dig> in pregnant animals vs. cyclic counterparts . tnrc6a expression was affected by day  but not the reproductive status. in cyclic animals tnrc6a expression was greatest on d <dig>  and subsequently decreased to reach the lowest levels on d <dig> . in pregnant animals, the lowest expression of tnrc6a was observed on d <dig> vs. d <dig> and d <dig> , and when compared to d <dig> of the estrous cycle . ago <dig> gene expression was affected by day  and the reproductive status . lower ago <dig> mrna expression observed on d <dig> of estrous cycle when compared to d <dig> , d <dig>  and d <dig> . on the other hand, the highest mrna expression of ago <dig> during estrous cycle was indicated on d <dig> when compared to other days . during pregnancy, ago <dig> mrna level was highest on d <dig> and gradually decreased on subsequent days , reaching the lowest levels on d <dig> . expression of this gene was decreased on d <dig> and d <dig> of pregnancy when compared to corresponding days of the estrous cycle . expression of ago <dig> was neither affected by day nor by the reproductive status . highest level of this gene in cyclic animals was observed on d <dig> vs. d <dig> . during pregnancy mrna level of ago <dig> did not differ significantly. expression of ago <dig> gene was maintained at comparable levels during the estrous cycle, while during pregnancy increased expression was observed on d <dig> when compared to other days . changed expression of ago <dig> on tested days  of the estrous cycle and pregnancy was indicated. low expression of this gene in endometria from cyclic gilts was observed on d <dig>  which gradually increased reaching the statistical significance on d <dig> . during pregnancy, ago <dig> level was higher on d <dig> in comparison to other days , and corresponding day of the estrous cycle .fig.  <dig> mirna synthesis and transport related molecules are differentially expressed in the porcine endometrium. a relative expression of ten genes related to mirna synthesis/transport. levels of drosha, dgcr <dig>  xpo <dig>  dicer <dig>  tarbp <dig>  tnrc6a and ago 1– <dig> genes are presented relatively to geometric means of actb and ppib. results are presented as boxplots with means ± sem. means with different superscripts differ significantly . * p <  <dig> , ** p <  <dig> , and *** p <  <dig>  indicate difference between reproductive states  within the same day . au – arbitrary units. b microphotographs illustrating immunofluorescent staining of dicer <dig>  and ago <dig>  proteins in the endometrial sections from d <dig> of pregnancy  and d <dig> of estrous cycle . lower panel shows negative controls; staining with mouse igg <dig> or nrs. dapi was used for counterstaining of the nuclei . nsb – non-specific binding , ge – glandular epithelium, le – luminal epithelium, s – stroma

overview of the sequences generated by illumina sequencing
average raw read counts obtained from illumina sequencing  ranged from  <dig> , <dig> on d <dig> of pregnancy up to  <dig> , <dig> on d <dig> of pregnancy. for instance, for d <dig> of the estrous cycle, number of reads, after applying phred quality score filtering  <cit>   was reduced from  <dig> , <dig> to  <dig> , <dig>  for  <dig>  sequences it was not possible to find adapter sequences, which resulted in reduction of total read count to  <dig> , <dig>  afterwards, sequences with length below 17 nt and sequences containing unknown nucleotides  were discarded. remaining  <dig> , <dig> valid sequences were collapsed, which resulted in the final number of  <dig>  unique sequences. in general, sequences obtained after pre-analysis for all libraries where characterized by length ranging from 17–31 nt with a predominant length of 22 nt, phred quality score from  <dig> to  <dig> and gc bases content per sequence around 40 % .

characterization of isomirs detected in the porcine endometrium
by aligning the valid, filtered sequences against the porcine genome   <cit> , mirbase v.  <dig>  <cit> , and nucleotide collection in ncbi blastn  <cit> ,  <dig> sequences  were annotated as mature mirnas and isomirs, found in pig or in other mammalian species . analysis aimed to characterize isomirs were performed only for the sequences known in the pig, which could be divided into the following groups: i) canonical, mature mirnas with isomirs , ii) only mature, canonical mirnas ; iii) only isomirs, without canonical form present in the dataset . in regard to the last group, additional step was performed and isomirs were described based on the presence of mature, canonical mirnas in the mirbase v.  <dig> . some sequences were excluded from further isomir characterization since it was not possible to annotate them to one canonical mirna . finally,  <dig> isomirs known in pig were included in the subsequent analysis. mir-10a-5p , mir- <dig>  and mir-140-3p  showed the highest numbers of isomirs. interestingly, numbers of reads for some isomirs were more abundant than for mature, canonical mirnas . modifications of the length were related to additions  and deletions  of nucleotides, present at 3’ or 5’ end, or at both ends simultaneously . modifications restricted to 3’ end accounted for 69 % of modifications , while modifications on 5’ end and both ends accounted for  <dig> and  <dig> sequences, respectively . the most frequent modification on 3’ and 5’ ends were del  with dominant del of 1 nt . the least frequently occurring modifications on the 3’ end were: add of 4 nt  and del of 6 nt , while on the 5’ end modifications applied only to two nucleotides . mirnas with the greatest number of modifications such as mir-10a-5p, mir- <dig> and mir-140-3p accounted for about 40–50 % of mean read counts for each group. moreover, isomir for mir- <dig>  with add of cytosine on 3’ end, had the highest number of reads  among all detected isomirs.fig.  <dig> modifications of mirna length expressed in the porcine endometria collected on different days of the estrous cycle or pregnancy. a percent of modifications affecting either 3’ end, 5’ end or both ends; b percent of additions and deletions on 3’ end, and percent of additions and deletions on 5’ end. c mean values of normalized read counts from all groups for reference/canonical mir-140-3p or its isomirs and sum of normalized read counts for each seed sequence. d expression of reference/canonical mir-140-3p  and its 5’ isomir with seed sequence ccacagg. mirna/isomir expression on different days of the estrous cycle and pregnancy  is presented as mean of normalized reads counts  ± sem. two-way anova analysis with bonferoni post-hoc test was performed on log-transformed values to find statistical differences. means with different superscripts differ significantly . ** p <  <dig> , indicate difference between reproductive states  within the same day



de mirnas and isomirs in endometrium of pregnant and cyclic pigs
normalization and statistical analysis performed with edger  <cit>  indicated that from  <dig> sequences,  <dig> were differentially expressed between all days of the estrous cycle  and pregnancy . log2-transformed fold change values ranged from − <dig>  up to  <dig> . the highest number of de mirnas was found between pd <dig> and cd <dig>  surprisingly no mirna reached the significant fdr level for comparison between the estrous cycle and pregnancy on d <dig> 

furthermore, for some sequences only isomirs or mature forms were differentially expressed, but for others both mirnas and isomirs showed altered patterns of expression. for instance, mir- <dig> was represented in our dataset by canonical mirna and  <dig> template 3’ isomirs of which only  <dig> showed significantly changed expression in pregnant vs. cyclic animals . among mirnas showing the highest number of isomirs, mir-140-3p was represented by canonical form,  <dig> isomirs of 3’ end and  <dig> isomirs with modified 5’ or both 5’ and 3’ ends . interestingly, canonical mir-140-3p and two 3’ isomirs showed similar expression pattern at different days of the estrous cycle or pregnancy . additionally, several mirnas/isomirs belonging to the same family, such as mir-23a/b or mir-148a/b also fallowed similar expression patterns . to check if mir-140-3p and its isomirs bearing the same sequence are differentially expressed and preserve expression profile of canonical sequence a sum of normalized read counts was subjected to further statistical analysis. interestingly, level of 3’isomirs and canonical mir-140-3p  was higher on pd <dig> vs. cd <dig> , cd <dig> vs. cd <dig> and vs. cd <dig> . moreover, highly expressed 5’ isomirs  fallowed similar expression pattern that was also true for combined read counts for both seed sequences .

unsupervised hierarchical clustering  and sota clustering were performed using only mature/canonical porcine or mammalian mirnas . more similar mirna expression pattern was observed for pd <dig> and cd <dig>  as well between pd <dig> and cd <dig>  the biggest distance calculated with pearson correlation coefficient was noted between pd <dig> and cd <dig> . according to the sota, de mirnas were grouped into  <dig> different clusters . several characteristic profiles could be observed. for example, in cluster  <dig> mirnas grouped , which levels were increased on pd <dig> and cd <dig>  and lower on pd <dig> and cd <dig> when compared to other analyzed days. cluster  <dig> consisted of  <dig> mirnas , which expression was elevated on pd <dig> and cd <dig>  and lower on cd <dig>  cluster  <dig> contained such mirnas as mir- <dig> and mir-34a, showing lower levels on pd <dig> in comparison to cd <dig>  for cluster  <dig> , expression profiles were characterized by elevated mirna levels on cd <dig> when compared with all other periods analyzed. venn diagrams  showed thirteen common mirnas up-regulated on pd <dig> in comparison to pd <dig> and pd <dig> . moreover, ten mirnas were found to be up-regulated  as well as down-regulated  on pd <dig> and pd <dig> comparing to pd <dig>  on the other hand, there was no mirnas commonly expressed between all comparisons presented, and only one mirna was found to be specifically up-regulated for comparison pd <dig> vs. pd <dig>  and pd <dig> vs. pd <dig> .fig.  <dig> mirnas/isomirs showing differential expression on d <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig> of the estrous cycle and early pregnancy. a dendrogram representing results of unsupervised hierarchical clustering  created with pearson correlation coefficient. rows indicate single mirnas, while columns represent different days of the estrous cycle and pregnancy. b clusters generated by self organizing tree algorithm  representing expression profiles of mature, canonical mirnas expressed in the porcine endometrium of pregnant and cyclic pigs. c venn diagrams demonstrating relations between de mirnas and isomirs for selected comparisons during pregnancy. marked up- and down-regulated mirnas were chosen for microarray validation by real-time rt-pcr. d relative expression of de mirnas selected for validation of illumina sequencing, using stem-loop real-time rt-pcr. mirna expression on different days of the estrous cycle and pregnancy  is presented relative to the reference let-7d-3p. two-way anova analysis with bonferoni post-hoc test was performed to find statistical differences. results are presented as boxplots with means ± sem. means with different superscripts differ significantly . * p <  <dig> , indicate difference between reproductive states  within the same day. au – arbitrary units



to confirm mirna profiles of several de mirnas found in sequencing, stem-loop real-time rt-pcr was performed. mirna expression profiles are presented relatively to the reference mirna let-7d  in fig. 3d. similar patterns as observed in sequencing data were observed for most of mirnas. higher levels of mir-23b were observed on pd <dig> vs. pd <dig> and pd <dig> . mir- <dig> expression was elevated on pd <dig> when compared to pd <dig> . increased levels of mir-30a-3p isomir  were observed on pd <dig> vs. pd <dig>  and on pd <dig> vs. cd <dig> . expression pattern for mir- <dig> was only confirmed for analyzed days of pregnancy, with decreased levels on pd <dig> vs. pd <dig> and pd <dig> . pcr miner analysis failed for mir- <dig>  since expression of this mirna was at the detection limit of the real-time rt-pcr method. nonetheless, when monitored in detail, expression of mir- <dig> was detectable exclusively in samples from pd <dig>  as it was observed in ngs data, except two samples with very few reads from cd <dig>  decreased levels of canonical mir-191-5p and its isomir - mir-191-5p del g  found to be significant on pd <dig> vs. cd <dig> in sequencing were not confirmed by real-time rt-pcr. using specific assays we also detected mir- <dig> and isomir mir-23a-3p del c , however their expression did not follow sequencing profile.

functional annotation and target prediction for de mirnas
unfortunately, most  of the freely available tools for mirna-mrna interaction predictions allow input of mirna names, but not sequences; thus cannot be used to adequate analysis of isomirs-mrna interactions. therefore, for biological processes and target prediction analysis  <dig> de mirnas with human identifiers were used in ingenuity pathway analysis . to expose more significant changes and processes in which de mirnas could be involved during the estrous cycle and pregnancy we selected pd <dig> vs. cd <dig>  pd <dig> vs. cd <dig>  pd <dig> vs. pd <dig> and pd <dig> vs. pd <dig> comparisons . top enriched processes for pd <dig> vs. cd <dig> comparison were those associated with cellular development , cell cycle , cell morphology  and mainly mir-205-5p was involved in this actions . when compared pd <dig> vs. cd <dig> the top processes affected were those related to cellular development , organismal development  and inflammatory response . several mirnas, which were related to abovementioned actions included mir-34a-5p, mir-205-5p, mir-30c-5p, mir-17-5p. cellular compromise , cellular development , cell cycle , and cell morphology  were among mostly enriched processes for pd <dig> vs. pd <dig> comparison. for pd <dig> vs. pd <dig> comparison, mir-23a-3p, mir-34a-5p, mir- <dig> were indicated as central molecules affecting cellular development , cell cycle , cell-to-cell signaling and interaction  or embryonic development . molecular pathways for selected comparisons were automatically generated in ipa and two examples are presented in fig. 4b.fig.  <dig> mirnas showing differential expression in porcine endometrium classified into various functions and pathways by ingenuity pathway analysis . a top molecular functions enriched with de mirnas for pd <dig> vs. cd <dig>  pd <dig> vs. pd <dig>  pd <dig> vs. cd <dig>  pd <dig> vs. pd <dig> and cd <dig> vs. c <dig> comparisons. the x-axis represents score for the likelihood  that genes belonging to a specific function category are affected in the specific comparisons. b networks representing molecules of interest differentially regulated in selected comparisons. the network is displayed graphically as nodes  and edges . the node color intensity indicates the fold-change expression of mirnas; with red representing up-regulation and green down-regulation of mirnas. the log <dig> fold change value and fdr for individual mirnas is indicated under each node. the shapes of nodes indicate the functional class of the gene product and the lines indicate the type of interaction, explained in the legend. all connections were integrated into the computationally generated networks on the basis of the evidence stored in the ipa knowledge memory indicating relevance for these networks



several mirna-mrna interactions revealed by the software indicated possible effects of mirnas action on genes crucial in pregnancy related events . for example, mir-23b was found to regulate progesterone  and estrogen  receptors, interleukin  <dig> receptor  and growth factors, such as fibroblast growth factor  <dig> . interestingly, vascular endothelial growth factor a  was found to be target for several mirnas, including mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-23b and mir- <dig>  among genes found to be putative targets for mir-27a were lif and its receptor , il6r or insulin growth factor  <dig> .table  <dig> selected pregnancy associated target genes for differentially expressed mirnas in the porcine endometrium


atarget prediction for de mirnas was done using ipa and mirwalk, which incorporate information from several algorithms such as: miranda, targetscan, mirdb, rna <dig>  pictar or diana-microt and mirwalk. mirna target genes identified by at least three of these algorithms were considered for analysis



overlapping expression of mirna and isomirs with different seed sequence found for mir-140-3p prompt us to predict putative targets for both seed sequences using targetscanhuman version  <dig>  or targetscanhuman custom version  <dig>   <cit> . fifty four common targets for canonical and non-canonical mir-140-3p  were found to regulate processes related to cell proliferation , apoptosis , cell differentiation , vasculogenesis , angiogenesis  or estrous cycle  as indicated by ipa .fig.  <dig> isomirs work cooperatively with canonical mirnas to affect putative targets gene expression in endometrial stromal cells. a venn diagrams demonstrating relations between targets identified for canonical and non-canonical mir-140-3p harboring different seed sequences. b top functional annotations organized into network representing common target mrnas regulated by canonical and non-canonical mir-140-3p. the network is displayed graphically as nodes  and edges . the shapes of nodes indicate the functional class of the gene product, explained in the legend. all connections were integrated into the computationally generated networks on the basis of the evidence stored in the ipa knowledge memory indicating relevance for these networks. c fold change expression of mir-140-3p and its 5’ isomir mimic transfected into endometrial stromal cells collected on d <dig> of pregnancy  is compared to negative control. let-7d-3p was used as reference for mir-140-3p and isomir mir-140-3p 5’ del u expression. mimics were used at  <dig> nm dose when added separately or  <dig> nm dose each when added simultaneously. d relative expression of canonical and non-canonical mir-140-3p putative target genes after mimics transfection into endometrial stromal cells from d <dig> of pregnancy . levels of acvr2b, kcma <dig>  sirt <dig>  lif and lpar <dig> genes are presented relatively to geometric means of hprt <dig> and actb. results are shown as boxplots with means ± sem. asterisks indicate significant differences, in comparison to the negative control . *p <  <dig> ; **p <  <dig> ; ***p <  <dig> 



regulation of gene expression by mir-140-3p and its 5’ isomir
since mir-140-3p was found to be differentially expressed in our data set and read count for its 5' isomir was about three times higher than canonical one we decided to test them further to answer the question whether sequence modifications of 5’ end of the canonical mirna may have a significant impact on putative target gene expression in porcine endometrial cells during pregnancy. we analyzed the effect of forced overexpression of porcine mir-140-3p and its isomir  on mrna levels of several putative targets in vitro. mirwalk  <cit>  and custom version of targetscanhuman custom version  <dig>   <cit>  were used to find putative targets for studied molecules, respectively. by generating venn diagram, we selected several genes, which were common or specific predicted targets for mirna or isomir .

because targetscanhuman and targetscanhuman custom consider matches to annotated human utrs and their orthologs in other species but not in sus scrofa, we also compared 3’utrs of five selected genes using the sscrofa  <dig>  genome assembly and the blastn search function. at least one highly conserved site was identified for acvr2b, kcnma <dig>  sirt <dig>  lif, and lpar <dig> .

transfection of mir-140-3p and its isomir proved to be efficient in primary porcine stromal cells . as demonstrated on fig. 5d, expression of acvr2b  was decreased in cells exposed to mir-140-3p . kcnma <dig>  predicted as a common putative target for mirna and isomir, was downregulated by all treatments . another common target sirt <dig> was affected only when mir and isomir were added simultaneously to the culture . expression of lif, predicted target for  <dig> ’isomir was decreased in cells transfected either with isomir alone  or mir-140-3p and isomir added simultaneously . interestingly, expression of lpar <dig> was not affected by any treatment.

discussion
endometrial receptivity acquisition, associated with altered gene expression, is essential for attachment of the conceptus and its firm adhesion to the luminal epithelium  <cit> . recently, mirnas have been recognized as substantial participants in pregnancy-associated events . here, we showed expression profile of genes involved in mirna synthesis and transport and we report a repertoire of mirnas and isomirs identified in porcine pregnant and cyclic endometria by deep sequencing analysis. a bioinformatic pipeline was developed to analyze raw data and annotate sequences to mirnas as well as to define in silico a potential role of mirnas expressed in the porcine endometrium. in vitro experiments proved that isomirs, i.e. mir-140-3p 5’ del u, are able to work cooperatively with canonical mirnas to affect putative targets gene expression in porcine endometrial stromal cells.

recently, we demonstrated pregnancy stage-dependent expression profiles of ten genes involved in mirna synthesis and transport in porcine conceptuses and trophoblast  <cit> . here, we expanded our investigation into expression profiles of drosha, dgcr <dig>  xpo <dig>  dicer <dig>  tarbp <dig>  tnrc6a, ago1- <dig> in the porcine endometrium across the estrous cycle and early pregnancy. it has been shown that estrogens and progesterone may regulate expression of mirna-synthesis-related genes as well as mirna expression  <cit> . bhat-nakshatri et al.  <cit>  proposed that this regulation may occur through steroid receptor-promoter interactions, with direct binding of esr <dig> to the regulatory regions of mirnas or mrna encoding genes containing mirnas. simultaneous estrogen and progesterone treatment in mice increased expression of drosha, dgcr <dig>  xpo- <dig> and dicer <dig>  <cit> . it was shown that this modulation occurs through cognate steroid receptors, since treatment with the respective antagonists, ici  <dig>  and ru- <dig>  reversed the stimulatory effect of these hormones on the expression of synthesis/transport-related genes. characteristic, status dependent profiles of genes involved in mirna synthesis and transport observed in the present study suggest possible steroid hormone regulations.

pre-ovulatory follicles in pigs intensely synthesize estrogen  <cit> , which triggers the luteinizing hormone  surge and prepares the female reproductive tract for conception. elevated xpo <dig>  tarbp <dig>  ago <dig> and ago <dig> levels around the time of ovulation coincide with increased estradiol levels in blood, whereas progesterone is maintained at a low level. on the other hand, by d <dig> gradually decreasing expression of drosha, dgcr <dig>  xpo <dig>  tarbp <dig>  tnrc6a and ago <dig> may be linked to reduced production of progesterone by cl in response to the luteolytic signal of endometrial pgf2α  <cit> . during pregnancy, porcine embryos produce and release in a biphasic manner large amounts of estrogen around d11-d <dig> and again between d <dig> and d <dig>  <cit> . although it is likely that endometrial gene expression during pregnancy is influenced by embryonic estrogen, concepti also produce cytokines such as ifn-γ and ifn-δ  <cit> , with the highest levels found on d <dig> of pregnancy  <cit> . after progesterone priming, ifns alone or together with estrogen may affect expression of many genes in the peri-implantation uterus  <cit> , including those involved in mirna synthesis and transport. in the present study, levels of drosha, dgcr <dig>  tnrc6a and ago <dig> in pregnant animals were lower on d <dig> and d <dig> compared to d <dig>  moreover, expression of drosha, tarbp <dig> and ago <dig> was also lower on d <dig> and d <dig> of pregnancy in comparison to corresponding days of the estrous cycle. although the mirna synthesis pathway in animals and plants has been well researched over the past decade, many questions have yet to be answered, including those about involvement of particular mirna synthesis and transport related proteins in generation of non-canonical mirnas.

recent studies applying deep sequencing in the pig were mainly focused on profiling mirna expression in regard to muscle development or fat deposition  <cit> . since early pregnancy events not only affect embryonic development but also the fate and quality of progeny after birth  <cit> , it is of great importance to trace the molecular pathways involved at the conceptus-maternal interface, especially in regard to mirna-mrna interactions. using high-throughput sequencing technology, we were able to reveal a wide range of mirnas and isomirs expressed in the porcine endometrium during the estrous cycle and pregnancy. although for a long time isomirs were linked to sequencing errors  <cit> , recently it has been shown that they can work cooperatively with canonical mirnas to affect various biological processes  <cit> . in our analyses aimed at characterizing isomirs, we focused only on template changes, whereas non-template  <cit>  ones were neglected. the number of modifications for annotated mirnas ranged from  <dig> up to  <dig>  with the highest numbers of isomirs found for mir-10a-5p , mir- <dig>  and mir-140- <dig> . interestingly, read counts for some isomirs were more abundant than for mature, canonical mirnas . modifications of length were related to add and del of  <dig> up to  <dig> nucleotides, and were present at 3’ or 5’ ends, or at both ends simultaneously. however, the majority of the variants produced resulted from differences in the 3´ terminus of the isomir.

stem-loop real-time rt-pcr was used to confirm mirna profiles of several de mirnas and isomirs found in sequencing. for example, isomir of mir-191-5p with a g deletion on the 3’ end  demonstrated a similar expression profile to canonical mir-191-5p. the isomir products can frequently be more abundant than the mirbase reference entry and in the case of mir-191-5p del g normalized read counts were 2– <dig> fold higher in comparison to canonical mir-191-5p. although del or add at the 3’ terminus of mirnas resulted in numerous length variations, the consequences of changes in the 5’ end could be more profound. this specific region bears a 6–8 nt long substring within the first 8 nt of the mirna  that is responsible for target recognition  <cit> . consequently, sequence modifications can cause a change in the seed region and affect the target repertoire of particular mirna. on the other hand, mirnas/5’isomirs originating from the same transcript may share several gene targets and therefore affect their expression in more specific manner.

as demonstrated, in our in vitro experiment transfection of cells with either mir-140-3p or mir-140-3p 5’ del u isomir or both added simultaneously significantly downregulated specific target genes as found in our in silico approach. however, in regard to certain targets inhibition of mrna levels could not be observed after 24 h from transfection. this could be explained at least partially by time dependent target regulation in response to mirna  <cit> . other results suggest that in the physiological conditions more complex interactions between mrna and mirna occurs influencing target recognition, including other context determinants outside of seed sites  <cit> . moreover, four types of seed-matched known to be selectively conserved  <cit>  have following hierarchy of site efficacy: 8mer > 7mer-m8 > 7mer-a1 > 6mer  <cit> . nonetheless, target prediction algorithms are still recognized as essential tools for discovery and characterization of mirna function because experimental data is still limited. as verified by our in vitro experiment, available prediction tools can be useful in deciphering complex gene regulation via mirna mediated mrna inhibition, which could be crucial for events occurring during the estrous cycle and pregnancy.

although in the present study read counts of several de canonical mirnas  were clearly lower than highly abundant mirnas  it seems likely that they still can sufficiently inhibit target genes, as mirnas select targets in a dose-dependent manner  <cit> . kozomara and co-workers  <cit>  showed that even though cellular concentrations of some mirnas differed by several orders of magnitude, yet induced similar repression of target mrnas. furthermore, many of de mirnas in the porcine endometria were co-expressed with their 3’ isomirs and other members of family  harboring the same seed sequence. thus, the cumulative concentrations of microrna/isomirs or mirnas from the same family may reach a level of biological activity or even multiple the effects.

functional annotation analysis provided insight into processes that might be affected by de mirnas. the top processes for pd <dig> vs. cd <dig> and pd <dig> vs. cd <dig> comparisons were linked to cellular development, cell cycle, inflammatory response, cell morphology or embryonic development, indicating the involvement of mirnas in tissue remodeling and preparation of the uterus for subsequent embryo implantation and placentation. among the molecules involved in these processes were mir-205-5p that could affect vegf expression  <cit>  or have an impact on the regulation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition by targeting the e-cadherin repressors zeb <dig> and zeb <dig>  <cit> , and mir-34a-5p that regulates apoptosis through the sirt1-p <dig> pathway  <cit> .

even though implantation in pigs is noninvasive, proteolytic activity of porcine embryos in vitro has been demonstrated  <cit> . moreover, culture medium conditioned by porcine embryos exhibited proteolytic activity that operated under acidic conditions  <cit> . physiological reduction of embryo invasiveness in pigs is accomplished via different protease inhibitors and a thick glycocalyx present on the surface of the endometrium  <cit> . in contrast, reduced expression of anti-adhesive molecules such as mucins on the endometrial surface is also required for embryo implantation  <cit> . here, we observed decreased expression of mir- <dig> in endometrium from d <dig> pregnant pigs in comparison to d <dig>  while on d <dig> the level started to increase. interestingly, mir- <dig> was found to inhibit invasiveness of cancer cells, reducing their migration via down-regulation of lim and sh <dig> domain protein  <dig> . moreover, bhat-nakshatri et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that expression of several mirnas, including mir- <dig>  is up-regulated in mcf- <dig> breast cancer cell lines after estrogen treatment. estrogen-dependent regulation of mir- <dig> levels in the porcine endometrium would be speculative; however, the profile of mir- <dig> expression observed in the current study corresponds to the biphasic synthesis of estrogen by porcine embryos  <cit> .

molecules synthesized by both embryos and the uterus may act locally in an autocrine, juxtacrine or paracrine manner or affect gene expression by distal tissues via endocrine pathways. an increasing body of evidence indicates that exosomes/microvesicles released by different cell types contain mirnas, which provide an alternative mode of cell-to-cell communication  <cit> . our recent study demonstrated that mir-125b, highly expressed in porcine conceptuses, can also be found in extracellular vesicles isolated from uterine flushings and is likely to regulate gene expression in endometrial epithelial cells  <cit> . a recent study by zhu et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that mir-23b by targeting tgfβ-activated kinase 1/map3k <dig> binding protein  <dig> , tab <dig> and an inhibitor of nf-κb kinase subunit α , suppresses activation of nuclear factor κ-b  and inflammatory cytokine expression induced by il <dig>  tumor necrosis factor α  or il1β. interestingly, rapid embryonic growth between d11-d <dig> in pigs is associated with increased il1β synthesis, while on subsequent days its expression decreases and uterine il1β content declines on d <dig>  reaching a nadir by d <dig> of pregnancy  <cit> . this cytokine not only stimulates embryonic growth or cell adhesion but also increases the activity of phospholipase a <dig>  <cit> , which is responsible for release of arachidonic acid from cell membranes, used for prostaglandin synthesis. interestingly, lower levels of mir-23b were observed on d <dig> in comparison to d <dig> in pregnant endometrium.

although pigs exhibit true epitheliochorial placentation that is distinct from that observed in humans or rodents  <cit> , blood vessel formation is equally imperative in all mammals to create a proper environment for exchange of nutrients, gases and metabolites between conceptuses and the endometrium. this process is tightly controlled by angiogenic factors, among which the most prominent is vegf  <cit> . in the present study, an altered expression profile of mir- <dig> was observed during pregnancy, with decreased levels on d <dig>  in the porcine endometrium, increased vegf expression was observed during pregnancy on d <dig> and d <dig>  <cit> , concomitant with intense blood vessel formation in the newly forming placenta  <cit> . wu et al.  <cit>  have already shown that mir- <dig> may directly affect expression of vegf, through recognition of its 3’utr region. under physiological conditions, angiogenesis is strictly regulated via actions of pro- and anti-angiogenic factors  <cit>  and a balance in their expression levels must be maintained for proper development of blood vessels in many tissues, including the endometrium.

recently, two independent studies in pigs  <cit>  demonstrated mirna expression in the porcine endometrium and implicated it in the regulation of embryo implantation or fetal loss. nonetheless, we emphasize that our approach provided new knowledge about mirna expression in the porcine endometrium, since deep sequencing analysis revealed a large repertoire of mirnas and isomirs during the estrous cycle and early pregnancy. wessels at al.  <cit>  showed that levels of  <dig> mirnas were increased and  <dig> decreased in non-pregnant  vs. day  <dig> healthy endometria. some of the identified mirnas, mir-27a, mir-30d, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  were also present in our dataset with similar expression profiles. su et al.  <cit>  analyzed mirna expression in endometrial samples but unfortunately they were collected on days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of pregnancy, which precludes comparison with our dataset.

CONCLUSIONS
a comprehensive catalog of transcriptome changes related to mirna synthesis occurring during the time of maternal recognition of pregnancy and conceptus attachment in pigs was revealed. bioinformatic analysis showed that micrornas via affecting number of pathways and specific processes such those related to cell-to-cell communication, cellular development, cell growth and proliferation might be involved in early pregnancy events, e.g. embryo implantation and placentation. moreover our in vitro approach proved that isomirs can be as much important factors regulating gene expression as canonical mirnas in porcine endometrial cells during pregnancy. nevertheless, many questions remained unanswered, including why such a big repertoire of isomirs exist in the porcine endometrium, how genes related to mirna synthesis could be responsible for generation of such a diversity in these small non-coding rnas, how changes in mirna/isomir content may affect female fertility? regardless of whether regulation of embryo-maternal interactions via mirna/isomir action is crucial or unique mechanism during early pregnancy, identification of mirnas and their modified counterparts in conjunction with indication of their possible role can advance our understanding of the mechanism underlying maternal recognition of pregnancy and embryo implantation in mammals.
