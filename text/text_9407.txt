BACKGROUND
expansins are encoded by a multi-gene family, and are composed of a superfamily of plant cell wall loosening proteins that induce ph-dependent wall extension and stress relaxation in a characteristic and unique manner  <cit> . expansins were first identified in studies investigating the mechanism of plant cell wall enlargement, and were isolated from cucumber hypocotyls  <cit> . recently, increasing numbers of expansins have been identified in other plant species, including oat  <cit> , tomato  <cit> , and maize  <cit> . according to the nomenclature proposed by kende et al.  <cit> , the expansin superfamily in plants may be divided into four subfamilies based on phylogenetic sequence analysis; these subfamilies are designated as α-expansin , β-expansin , expansin-like a , and expansin-like b . α-expansin and β-expansin proteins are known to exhibit cell wall loosening activity, and are involved in cell expansion and other developmental events; however, expansin-like a and expansin-like b are only known from their gene sequences  <cit> , with no experimental evidence about their activity on the cell wall being published  <cit> .

functional studies have shown that expansins are involved in many developmental processes, such as fruit softening  <cit> , xylem formation  <cit> , abscission   <cit> , seed germination  <cit> , and the penetration of pollen tubes  <cit> . the plant cell wall is composed of cellulose microfibrils, which bind to various glycans, including xyloglucan and xylan. the extension of the cell wall involves the movement and separation of cellulose microfibrils by the process of molecular creeping. α-expansinis hypothesized to promote such movement, by inducing the local dissociation and slippage of xyloglucans, whereas β-expansin is theorized to work in a similar manner on a different glycan, perhaps xylan  <cit> . however, no assays have demonstrated that expansins have hydrolytic activity or any other enzymatic activities  <cit> .

expansin proteins are typically 250– <dig> amino acids long, and contain two domains that are preceded by a signal peptide of 20– <dig> amino acids in length  <cit> . domain i has significant, but distant, homology to glycoside hydrolase family family- <dig>  proteins, including a series of conserved cysteines and a his-phe-asp  motif that makes up part of the catalytic site of family- <dig> endoglucanases  <cit> . domain ii is distantly related to group- <dig> grass pollen allergens  <cit> . domain ii is speculated to be a polysaccharide binding domain based on conserved aromatic and polar residues on the surface of the protein  <cit> . only the crystal structure of one bacterial expansin  <cit>  and the zea m  <dig> in maize  <cit>  have been solved.

the completion of soybean genome sequencing  <cit>  provides us with an opportunity to improve our understanding about the evolution, and other characteristics, of the expansin superfamily in this plant species. in this study, we identified the expansin genes in the soybean genome, and grouped them into four subfamilies. in addition, the expansion patterns of the expansin gene family in arabidopsis, rice, and soybean were examined. the results indicated that expansin genes in soybean are generated through tandem and segmental duplication. analysis of the transcriptome atlas of soybean expansin genes in different tissues under normal conditions indicated notable differential expression among subfamilies. this finding indicates the presence of broad functional divergence in this superfamily. critical amino acids that are responsible for functional divergence were detected. in addition, the location of the amino acid sites that are responsible for functional divergence and/or positive selection indicated the conservation of domain i and the c terminus. the results presented in this study are expected to facilitate further research on this gene family, and provide new insights about the evolutionary history of expansins.

RESULTS
genome-wide identification of the expansin gene superfamily in soybean
through soybean genome blast and online software identification, a total of  <dig> soybean expansin genes  were identified based on expansin nomenclature  <cit> . all of the  <dig> members contained the two domains  based on pfam and smart tests. proteins that have only one of these domains, or that did not have an integral open reading frame, were excluded. the protein sequences , coding sequences  , genomic sequences , and 1500 bp of the nucleotide sequences upstream of the translation initiation codon  were all downloaded from the phytozome database . in addition, the physical positions of the expansin genes were also obtained from the phytozome database, and were used to map them to their corresponding chromosomes . the results showed that, with the exception of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  expansin genes could be mapped on all chromosomes from  <dig> to  <dig>  chromosome  <dig> had the highest density of expansin genes, with nine members, whereas chromosome  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> contained no more than two expansin genes. to clarify which subfamily  these expansin genes belonged to, we employed mega v <dig>  to construct an unrooted phylogenetic tree using the neighbor-joining  method, using the entire expansin protein sequences of soybean, arabidopsis, and rice . since the expansin genes of arabidopsis and rice have already been classified, we were able to classify the soybean expansin genes according to the clustering exhibited on the phylogenetic tree. the soybean expansin genes were accordingly classified into the four known subfamilies: α-expansin , β-expansin , expansin-like a , and expansin-like b . on the basis of the nomenclature rules proposed by kende et al.  <cit> , we named the  <dig> expansin genes in soybean using their loci and the subfamily to which they belonged. basic information on all soybean expansins  is provided in additional file  <dig>  the  <dig> expansins in soybean are 218 ~  <dig> amino acids long, with a molecular weight ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> kd. all  <dig> expansins contain signal peptides of  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids in length, except for  <dig> members that lack signal peptides. the pi value ranges from  <dig>  to  <dig>  in the soybean expansin superfamily, with differences existing between exlb and other subfamilies. almost all of the members in the expa, expb, and exla subfamilies have pi values above  <dig> , while the pi values of most members in exlb are below  <dig> .

to obtain more information about the size characteristics of the four expansin subfamilies, we compared the expansin genes in five plant species . data on the sizes of the four subfamilies in arabidopsis and rice were obtained from a review  <cit> . in addition, we conducted genome-wide identification of the expansin gene superfamily in medicago truncatula and phaseolus vulgaris , following the same method used for the identification of the soybean expansin gene superfamily.  <dig> and  <dig> expansin genes were identified in the phaseolus vulgaris and medicago truncatula, respectively. we then classified these expansin genes into four subfamilies according to the phylogenetic tree . the results of the size comparisons of the subfamilies among the five species are shown in table  <dig>  the distribution of the expansin genes in the four subfamilies was rather uneven. in each of the five species, exla had the smallest subfamily size, while expa had the largest subfamily size . the two legumes, soybean and phaseolus vulgaris, had much larger exlb subfamilies  compared to just one member in both arabidopsis and rice. in contrast, the legume medicago truncatula only had one exlb member. in addition, the expb subfamily was much larger in rice compared to the other four dicot species.

phylogenetic and structural analysis of expansin genes in soybean
we performed a multiple sequence alignment  and constructed a phylogenetic tree of the  <dig> soybean expansin genes based on their deduced amino acid sequences . the expansin proteins from the same subfamily were clustered together. the phylogenetic classification was found to be consistent with the motif locations and exon-intron organizations among the four subfamilies.

as displayed schematically in figure  <dig>   <dig> types of motif  were detected. the type, order, and number of motifs were similar in proteins of the same subfamily, but differed to proteins in other subfamilies. in the expa subfamily,  <dig> %  of members shared the same eight motif components  in the same order, which was significantly different to that of the other three subfamilies in which the members lacked motifs  <dig> and  <dig>  moreover, motif  <dig> was present in all genes of all subfamilies, except expa. consequently, the motif distribution in expa was significantly different to that in the other three subfamilies, leading to the subfamilies expb, exla, and exlb having a closer evolutionary and phylogenetic relationship. however, most expansins  in the expb subfamily contained motif  <dig>  which was present in all expansins of the expa subfamily, but not in the exla and exlb subfamilies. this finding indicates that expa and expb have a closer evolutionary and phylogenetic relationship compared to expa with the exla/exlb subfamilies. therefore, it indicates that the motif locations of expansins belonging to the same subfamily are conserved, whereas divergence exists among expansins from the four subfamilies.

the exon-intron organization of the expansin genes in soybean was examined by comparing the predicted coding sequences  with their corresponding genomic sequences through the online software gsds , to obtain more insights about their possible gene structural evolution. because an atg sequence is located near to the first initiation codon of gmexlb <dig>  the software gsds recognized the subsequent atg as the initiation codon. thus, the exon-intron organization of this gene was preceded by a short 5′-utr, whereas in other genes it was not . our results showed that genes in the same family generally have similar exon-intron structures, with the same number of exons. for example, all genes from the expb and exla subfamilies contain four exons, most genes from the expa subfamilies contain three exons, while the genes from exlb families contain five exons. in turn, this finding supported the classification of the expansin genes in soybean. moreover, this result reflects the divergence in the gene structure of the four subfamilies. in addition, variations are present in the exon-intron structure of genes from the expa and exlb subfamilies, with several genes containing different numbers of exons. most of the expansin genes in the expa subfamily contain three exons, while the remainder contains two or four exons. this variation might have resulted from the loss or gain of exons over a long evolutionary period. furthermore, comparison of the exon-intron structure among genes from the four subfamilies indicated that the expb and exla subfamilies are more conserved compared to the expa and exlb subfamilies.

the results of the phylogenetic and structural analysis revealed that each of the four subfamilies was conserved, and that there was also broad diversification among subfamilies. the high degree of sequence identity and similar exon-intron structures of expansin genes within each family indicates that the soybean expansin superfamily has undergone gene duplications throughout evolution. as a result, the expansin gene families contain multiple copies that might partially or completely overlap in function, with the analysis of the soybean gene expansion and expression pattern in this study supporting this hypothesis.

analysis of expansin gene expansion pattern
gene duplications are considered to be one of the primary driving forces in the evolution of genomes and genetic systems  <cit> . duplicated genes provide raw material for the generation of new genes, which, in turn, facilitate the generation of new functions. segmental duplication, tandem duplication, and transposition events, such as retroposition and replicative transposition  <cit> , are considered to represent three principal evolutionary patterns. of these patterns, segmental and tandem duplications have been suggested to represent two of the main causes of gene family expansion in plants  <cit> . segmental duplications multiple genes through polyploidy followed by chromosome rearrangements  <cit> . it occurs most frequently in plants because most plants are diploidized polyploids and retain numerous duplicated chromosomal blocks within their genomes  <cit> . tandem duplications were characterized as multiple members of one family occurring within the same intergenic region or in neighboring intergenic regions  <cit> . in this study, we defined tandem duplicated genes as adjacent homologous genes on a single chromosome, with no more than one intervening gene. for this analysis, we focused on segmental and tandem duplication events. to gain a greater insight about the expansion pattern of soybean expansin genes in this huge gene family, we identified tandem duplicated clusters based on the gene locus, and searched the plant genome duplication database  <cit>  to locate segmentally duplicated pairs. we searched for contiguous expansin genes in both the sharing and neighboring regions. we found that  <dig> out of  <dig> genes  in this family are tandem repeats in soybean , indicating that tandem duplications have contributed to the expansion of this family. we also tested the hypothesis that segmental duplication events play an important role in the evolution of the expansin superfamily in soybean. we searched each soybean expansin gene in pgdd , and found that 68%  of genes are involved in segmental duplication . of interest, when we compared the  <dig> segmentally duplicated genes identified in our study with the results of du et al.  <cit> ,  <dig>  expansin genes originated from whole genome duplications , while the remaining  <dig>  expansin genes were singletons . this finding indicates that the remaining  <dig> segmentally duplicated expansin genes might be derived from independent duplication events. therefore, part of the expansin genes in soybean was retained after wgds. previous studies have suggested that the genes retained as duplicated pairs after wgd events tend to belong to specific classes, such as transcription factors and members of large multiprotein complexes  <cit> , which supports the results of the present study.

in parallel, we calculated the 4dtv of these tandem-duplicated gene pairs  using paml v <dig> . the 4dtv values ranged from  <dig>  for recently duplicated peptides, to  <dig> , for paralogs with an ancient evolutionary past. the results showed that all of the 4dtv values were around  <dig> , much larger than  <dig>  hence, we deduced that the tandem-duplicated gene pairs may have an ancient evolutionary past. as shown on the gene map, two large tandem-duplicated gene clusters from the exlb families are present on chromosome  <dig> and 17; thus, chromosome  <dig> is the chromosome with the highest density of expansin genes in soybean. obviously, the duplication events, particularly tandem duplication, might result in the uneven distribution of expansin genes on chromosomes, to a certain extent. in addition, we used ks as a proxy for time, and the conserved flanking protein coding genes to estimate the dates of the segmental duplication events. the mean ks values and the estimated dates for all segmental duplication events corresponding to expansin genes are listed in table  <dig>  the segmental duplication events in soybean appear to have occurred during two relatively recent key periods, 10– <dig> mya and 40– <dig> mya, except for the independent duplication events. these inferences are consistent with the ages of the soybean genome duplication events, which occurred at approximately  <dig> and  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . this is compatible with our result that  <dig>  of the expansin genes originated from wgds according to the data from du et al.  <cit> . therefore, our findings indicate that most of genes involved in segmental duplication are a result of whole genome duplication events, while the remainder may have arisen as a result of separate segmental duplication events.

overall, these results indicate that the expansin gene superfamily has expanded by both segmental and tandem duplication, particularly segmental duplication. furthermore, most of the genes involved in segmental duplication were retained after wgds.

expression analysis of expansin gene superfamily in soybean
the recently developed rna-seq web-based tools, which include gene expression data across multiple tissues and organs, allow for characterization and comparison of the gene transcriptome atlas in soybean. consequently, distinct transcription abundance patterns are readily identifiable in the rna-seq atlas dataset for soybean expansin genes. the rna-seq atlas data of soybean expansin genes  were downloaded from soybase . however, six expansin genes  lacked rna-seq atlas data, which might indicate that these genes are pseudogenes, or are only expressed at specific developmental stages or under special conditions. the rna-seq atlas analysis indicated that many of the soybean expansin genes exhibited low transcript abundance levels. we observed that the accumulation of expansin gene transcripts was associated with different tissues, and that the expression patterns differed among each expansin gene member . in soybean, 31%  of the analyzed expansins were constitutively expressed in all of the seven tissue types examined. this finding indicates that expansins are involved in multiple processes during the development of soybean. in contrast, most soybean expansins exhibited preferential expression. the rna-seq atlas data revealed that the majority  of soybean expansins exhibit transcript abundance profiles with marked peaks in only a single tissue type. this result indicates that these expansins function as cell wall loosening proteins, and are limited to discrete cells or organs. approximately 25% , 20%, 13%, 11%, 9%, and 7% soybean expansins exhibited the highest transcript accumulation level in root tissue, seed tissue, pod shell tissue, leaf tissue, nodule tissue, and flower tissue, respectively. the first reported root-specific soybean expansin gene  <cit>  has a high expression level in the root, and plays an important role in the root of soybean. according to the gene loci, it only corresponds to gmexpa <dig> . as shown in figure  <dig>  gmexpa37has a marked peak in the transcript abundance profile of root tissue only, which is consistent with previous research  <cit> . according to the libault atlas  <cit>  , gmexpa <dig> tends to be expressed in root hairs; hence, it might contribute to the development of root hairs. the wide expression of these genes indicates that expansin genes from soybean are involved in the development of all organs and tissues under normal conditions. although expansin genes might have general, overlapping expression in some instances, in other cases, expression might be highly specific, and limited to a single organ or cell type. some expansins were only expressed in a single tissue: seven genes  were only expressed in root; three genes  were only expressed in the seed; two genes  were only expressed in the flower; one gene  was only expressed in the nodule; and one gene  was only expressed in the leaf. our analysis indicated that these genes might be tissue-specific or, at least, preferentially expressed. interestingly, these results showed that more genes of the expansin gene superfamily might be specifically or preferentially expressed in the root. another heatmap  based on the libault atlas provided more information about the genes that were preferentially expressed in roots. the libault atlas focus on the below ground tissues and provide more information about the genes highly expressed in the underground tissues, especially in root, root hair, root tip.

in addition, expansin genes that were clustered in branches in the heatmap exhibited similar transcript abundance profiles. however, most of these genes were not clustered in the phylogenetic tree and were relatively phylogenetically distinct. only several small phylogenetic clades had largely similar transcript abundance profiles, and were marked on the heatmap in red outlined boxes . soybean expansins that have high sequence similarity and share expression profiles represent good candidates for the evaluation of gene functions in soybean. therefore, genes in the red outlined boxes may have a similar function in the same tissues. for example, gmexpa <dig> and gmexpa <dig>  which were clustered in the phylogenetic tree with high sequence similarity only expressed in the root tissue, which indicates that both genes may have the same function in the root tissue.

the transcriptome atlas indicated that all four subfamilies of the soybean expansin superfamily were differentially expressed, which may be associated with the divergence of the promoter regions of the expansin genes. promoters in the upstream region of genes play key roles in conferring developmental and/or the environmental regulation of gene expression  <cit> . thus, profiles of cis-acting elements may provide useful information about the regulatory mechanism of gene expression. a computational tool, plantcare  <cit> , was used to identify cis-acting elements in the 1500-bp dna sequence upstream of the translation initiation codon of expansin genes in soybean. four types of cis-acting element were found to be significantly abundant in the promoter region of the soybean expansin gene superfamily . the first type of cis-acting element enriched in the promoter region is the light-responsive element, which includes the g-box  <cit> , box  <dig>  <cit> , and box i  <cit> . the g-box appears to be the most abundant light-responsive element in soybean expansin genes, with a mean number of  <dig>  copies, while the g-box is less abundant in exlb  compared to the other three subfamilies. another class of cis-acting elements enriched in the promoter region of expansin genes is the plant hormone-responsive elements, including the tca-element  <cit> , tga-element  <cit> , and gare-motif  <cit> . the salicylic acid-responsive tca-element appears to be the most abundant hormone-related cis-acting element in soybean expansin genes, indicating that salicylic acid regulates the expression of some soybean expansin genes. the abundance of the tga-element and gare-motif in soybean expansin genes indicates that auxin and gibberellin also play roles in regulating soybean expansin gene expression. other elements are also related to auxin- or gibberellin-responsiveness, such as auxrr-core  <cit> , tga-box  <cit> , p-box  <cit> , and tatc-box  <cit> . these results are consistent with previous studies, which reported that some expansins are regulated by auxin  <cit>  and gibberellin  <cit> . the third most abundant cis-acting element class contains elements that respond to external environment stresses. we observed that most soybean expansin genes appeared to contain are  <cit> , mbs  <cit> , hse  <cit> , and tc-rich elements  <cit> . are is an element involved in anaerobic induction; hence, we speculated that the anaerobic regulation of expansin expression could be tissue or developmental stage depend. the drought-responsive element mbs is also abundant in the promoter region. with few exceptions, expansin genes contain at least one copy of this element . these results are consistent with the fact that expansin activities have been found to be influenced by various abiotic stressors, including drought  <cit>  and flooding  <cit> . circadian elements, which are involved in circadian control  <cit> , comprise the fourth class of cis-acting element that was abundantly found in the promoter region of soybean expansin genes. plantcare analysis showed that soybean expansin genes contain circadian elements, potentially indicating that expansin has a distinct diurnal expression pattern  <cit> . promoter analysis demonstrated the presence of a diversity of cis-acting elements in the upstream regions of the soybean expansin gene superfamily. this finding provides further support for the various functional roles of expansins in a wide range of developmental processes related to cell wall modification.

these results indicate that the  <dig> expansin genes in soybean display differential expression in the four subfamilies, either in the abundance of their transcripts or in their expression patterns under normal growth conditions.

functional divergence analysis of soybean expansin proteins
functional divergence among the subfamilies of the soybean expansin superfamily was inferred by posterior analysis using the program diverge v <dig> . the posterior probability  of divergence at each site was calculated to predict the location of certain critical amino acid sites   <cit>  that are highly relevant to functional divergence. in our study, two types of functional divergenence were estimated. type-i functional divergence refers to the evolutionary process resulting in a site-specific shift in the evolutionary rate after gene duplication, whereas type-ii functional divergence refers to the site-specific amino acid physiochemical property shift. these methods have been extensively applied to the research of various gene families, as they are not sensitive to the saturation of synonymous sites  <cit> . the estimate was based on the neighbor-joining tree constructed from all of the protein sequences of the  <dig> soybean expansin genes. in comparison, the subfamily exla, which contains only two members was excluded, because groups with less than four sequences cannot be analyzed using this method. pairwise comparisons of paralogous expansin genes from the remaining three subfamilies were carried out, and the rate of amino acid evolution at each sequence position was estimated. our results  indicate that the coefficients of type-i functional divergence  among the three expansin subfamilies were strongly statistically significant , with the θi values ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . hence, significant site-specific changes altered the selective constraints on expansin members of the superfamily, leading to subgroup-specific functional evolution after diversification. type-ii functional divergence  between the subfamilies  was evident with an θii value of  <dig>  , which is suggestive of a radical shift in amino acid properties. the coefficients of type ii functional divergence θ between expa/expb and expb/exlb were not that evident, with θii values smaller than  <dig> being obtained, but with high standard errors. hence, the relative importance of type-i and type-ii functional divergence appears to be different regarding the functional divergence of subfamilies of the soybean expansin superfamily.

sites in bold means they are responsible for both type-i and type-ii functional divergence.

furthermore, we predicted that some critical amino acid residues are responsible for functional divergence, with suitable cut-off values being derived from the qk of each comparison. given that too many functional divergence-related residues  were identified by diverge <dig> when the empirically qk value  <dig>  was used as a cutoff value, we used qk >  <dig>  to predict caass to exclude other sites for further analysis. as a result, a total of  <dig> caass were predicted through type-i functional divergence analysis, whereas  <dig> amino acid sites with fairly high probability  were identified through type-ii functional divergence analysis, which is indicative of a radical shift in evolution rate and amino acid properties to some extent. furthermore,  <dig> amino acids are crucial for both the type-i and the type-ii functional divergence, indicating that shifts in evolutionary rates and altered amino acid physicochemical properties co-occurred at the these amino acid sites. hence, these sites probably played important roles in functional divergence during the evolutionary process. in addition, we also noticed that the number of predicted sites  within each pair differs between type-i and type-ii functional divergence; namely, more caass were identified by type-ii functional divergence within each subfamily pair. hence, the functional divergence between the genes of the two groups is mainly attributed to rapid changes in amino acid physiochemical properties, followed by the shift in the evolutionary rate.

besides, in contrast with expa/expb and expb/exlb, expa/exlb had relatively larger coefficients of functional divergence  and much more sites that were related to functional divergence. hence, the functional divergence that exists between expa and exlb is more significant compared with that present in expa/expb and expb/exlb, although no biological or biochemical function has yet been established for any members of exlb  <cit> . in addition, we also deduced that a lesser degree of functional divergence occurred within expa/expb and expb/exlb based on the coefficients of functional divergence and the number of identified caass. hence, expb and exlb have a much closer phylogenetic relationship compared with expa and exlb, which was also indicated by the motif analysis. the motif analysis showed that the expa subfamily has a clearly different motif organization compared to the other two subfamilies, whereas the expb and exlb subfamilies shared similar types and numbers of motifs.

positive selection analysis
to test the hypothesis of positive selection in soybean expansin genes, we used the site model and the branch site model in the codeml program of the paml v <dig>  software package  <cit> . the substitution rate ratios of non-synonymous  versus synonymous  mutations  were calculated. the ka/ks ratio should be  <dig> for genes subject to neutral selection, < <dig> for genes subject to negative selection, and > <dig> for genes subject to positive selection  <cit> . in the site model, codon site models m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  and m <dig> were implemented, using likelihood ratio tests to test whether variable ω  ratios were present at the amino acid sites. m <dig> is the one-ratio model that assumes one ω ratio at all sites. in the discrete model , the probabilities  of each site were submitted to purifying, neutral, and positive selection, respectively, and their corresponding ω ratios  were inferred from the data. the beta model  is a null test for positive selection, assuming a beta distribution with ω between  <dig> and  <dig>  finally, the beta & ω model  add one extra class with the same ratio ω <dig>  <cit> . in our study, two pairs of models  were selected and compared . first, models m <dig> and m <dig> were compared, using a test for heterogeneity between codon sites in the dn/ds ratio value, in which twice the log likelihood difference, 2Δℓ =  <dig>  would indicate a strongly statistically significant result , reflecting large selective pressure on the soybean expansin superfamily; namely, soybean expansin has undergone strong positive selection. the comparison of m <dig> versus m <dig> revealed that none of the codon sites appeared to be under the influence of positive selection . in contrast, the comparison of m <dig>  and m <dig> , which is considered to be the most stringent test of positive selection  <cit> , indicated that ~ <dig> % codons fell within an estimated ω value of  <dig>  . on the basis of the bayesian posterior probabilities,  <dig> codon site candidates  for positive selection were identified from the m <dig> models. of these sites, eight positive selection sites were at the  <dig>  significance level, while the remainder was at the  <dig>  significance level. four amino acid residues  that were identified in the site-model were also responsible for functional divergence; namely, 172 l and 184g were responsible for type-i functional divergence, while 190s and 196p were responsible for type-ii functional divergence.

*sites were also found to be implicated in the functional divergence.

in the branch site model, ω is allowed to vary both among sites in the protein and across branches on the tree, with the aim of detecting positive selection that only affects a few sites along particular lineages  <cit> . the branches being tested for positive selection are referred to as the foreground branches, while the remaining branches on the tree are referred to as background branches. the beb method was implemented to calculate posterior probabilities  for site classes if the lrt indicates the presence of codons under positive selection on the foreground branch  <cit> . each soybean expansin subfamily was selected as a foreground branch, to test for positive selection. the results  show that divergent positive selection was detected among the four subfamilies. when expb, exla, or exlb were selected as the foreground branch, the foreground ω values were fairly large, and nearly all codon site candidates were identified; however, none of the codons had a posterior probability higher than  <dig> , except for 192 t, which had a posterior probability of  <dig>  when exlb was chosen as the foreground branch. no sites with posterior probabilities higher than  <dig>  were found when the expb or exla subfamily was chosen as the foreground branch. however, positive selection often acts on a few sites and in a short period of evolutionary time; hence, the signal may be swamped by widespread negative selection  <cit> . in contrast, when expa was chosen as the forebranch, the foreground ω value  was much lower, and a total of  <dig> sites  with posterior probabilities higher than  <dig>  being identified.

these results indicate divergent selective constraints on the four subfamilies. the expb and exla subfamilies are considerably more conserved compared to the expa and exlb subfamilies. furthermore, the expa subfamily might have been subject to the strongest positive selection among the four subfamilies, as the most highly significant positive sites were detected in this subfamily.

discussion
origin of the soybean expansin gene superfamily
recent research studies have assumed that 70% ~ 80% of angiosperms have undergone duplication events  <cit> . for example, 90% and 62% of arabidopsis thaliana and oryza sativa loci have undergone duplication events  <cit> . as an ancient polyploid, soybean has a highly duplicated genome, with nearly 75% of the genes present occurring in multiple copies  <cit> . the current investigation revealed the duplication pattern of the soybean expansin gene family. eleven genes were identified as tandem repeats, indicating that tandem duplication has also contributed to the expansion of the soybean expansin gene superfamily. in addition,  <dig> genes were found to have evolved from segmental duplication, indicating that segmental duplication probably played a pivotal role in expansin gene expansion in the soybean genome. the genome sequencing results revealed that whole genome duplications  in soybean occurred at approximately  <dig> and  <dig> million years ago , which is consistent with results of the present study. we inferred that expansion of the expansin gene family occurred along with wgd events, and that these genes were retained during evolution. previous research has indicated that rapid functional divergence and the biased expression of duplicated genes appear to be major factors promoting their retention in the genome  <cit> . in our study, significant functional divergence was identified among the four subfamilies, with duplicated genes exhibiting diverse expression. for instance, in one duplicated gene pair, gmexpa <dig> &gmexpa <dig>  the two genes were retained after genome duplication events, with only gmexpa <dig> being expressed in the leaf, indicating biased expression. similar cases have also been observed in other segmentally duplicated gene pairs, such as gmexpa <dig> &gmexpa <dig>  gmexpa <dig> &gmexpa <dig>  and gmexpa <dig> &gmexpa <dig>  these results further verified our hypothesis that most of the segmentally duplicated soybean expansin genes have been retained from genome duplication events. analysis of the expansion pattern of the expansin gene superfamily revealed that the soybean genome had undergone large-scale duplication. both segmental and tandem duplication are important contributors to the expansion of the expansin gene superfamily.

we also analyzed the expansion pattern of the expansin superfamily in arabidopsis  and rice . the results of the present study showed that 50%  of genes were involved in segmental duplication, while  <dig> %  of genes were involved in tandem duplication in arabidopsis. in comparison,  <dig> %  of genes were involved in segmental duplication and  <dig> %  of genes were involved in tandem duplication in rice. in soybean, 68%  of genes were involved in segmental duplication and  <dig> %  of genes were involved in tandem duplication. hence, we observed that both segmental and tandem duplication have played significant roles in the expansion of the expansin superfamily in soybean, arabidopsis, and rice. previous studies have revealed that genes encoding transcription factors and ribosomal components are significantly over-retained following tetraploidy  <cit> . however, genes influencing the stress response have an elevated probability of retention following tandem duplication  <cit> . expansin genes are associated with cell wall enlargement. however, while these genes are not transcription factors, ribosomal components, or genes that influence stress response, they have expanded through both tandem and segmental duplication, instead of just one form of duplication or the other. more intriguingly, we also noticed that the three species showed species-specific expansion patterns. for instance, segmental duplication seemed to be the predominant form of expansion of the expansin gene superfamilies of the two dicots, arabidopsis and soybean. in contrast, tandem duplication seemed to be the predominant form of the expansion way for the expansin gene family of the monocot, rice.

previous studies have shown that β-expansin genes are particularly numerous and abundantly expressed in grasses, but are also found in reduced numbers in dicots  <cit> . our results comparing the size of the expansin gene family in soybean, arabidopsis, and rice are consistent with these previous studies. the expb family in rice is much larger compared to that of soybean and arabidopsis. we also found that the exlb family is much larger in soybean compared with arabidopsis and rice. however, the expa family had the largest size in all three species. previous research has shown that major variations in family size and the distribution of most gene families are affected by tandem duplications and segmental duplications  <cit> . consequently, we compared the duplication events of the four subfamilies in the three species . major variation was exhibited among the subfamilies and species. the much larger size of the expb family in rice might have been caused by this family expanding at a different rate compared with that in the other two species. all of the genes of the expb family in rice were involved in segmental or tandem duplication; however, only four were involved in both segmental and tandem duplication, whereas only part of the genes of the expb families in soybean and arabidopsis were involved in duplication events. alternatively, from the perspective of adaptiveness, more genes of the expb subfamily in rice might be retained after duplication events, whereas the expb subfamily in soybean and arabidopsis were subject to large-scale gene loss, leading to fewer expb genes being retained. thus, the higher degree of expansion and retention of the expb family in rice caused it to become much larger. similarly, the higher degree of expansion and retention might also explain the much larger size of the exlb subfamily in soybean. our results indicated that tandem duplication was the predominant contributor to the expansion of the soybean exla subfamily and 74% genes in exlb that were involved in tandem duplication, and may be retained over a long evolutionary period. however, the genes of the exlb subfamilies in arabidopsis and rice were not involved in segmental or tandem duplication events. therefore, both segmental and tandem duplication events contributed to the ever-expanding exlb subfamily in soybean.

recent research has shown that zea m  <dig>  and orthologous group- <dig> pollen allergens in other grasses are highly abundant in pollen. these genes may induce extension only in grass cell walls, but are not effective on the walls of dicots, aiding the penetration of the pollen tube through the stigma and style by softening the maternal cell walls  <cit> . moreover, β-expansin genes are particularly numerous and abundantly expressed in grasses  <cit> . in this study, we deduced that the size of the rice expb subfamily has increased to adapt to specific functional needs during the long evolutionary timeframe. alternatively, more genes of the rice expb subfamily might have been subjected to a higher degree of post-duplication retention for important functions in rice development. in comparison, the genes of the expb subfamily of the other two species might have undergone large-scale gene loss during evolution. the even larger size of the exlb subfamily in soybean might also reflect adaptations to certain functions or environments. hence, the exlb members might have a special function in soybean development; however, experimental evidence has yet to establish their activity in the cell wall  <cit> .

functional divergence and positive selection analysis
gene duplications are considered to be one of the primary driving forces in the evolution of genomes and genetic systems  <cit> . typically, an amino acid residue is highly conserved in one duplicate gene, but highly variable in the other one  <cit> . amino acid site mutation is frequent, with the accumulation of mutations potentially contributing to the functional divergence of duplicated genes  <cit> . through the functional divergence analysis, critical amino acid sites  were detected. these sites are major contributors to the functional divergence among the four soybean subfamilies. rapid functional divergence and the biased expression of duplicated genes is expected to promote retention of the gene of the two homologs, or homoeologs derived from wgd  <cit> . in our study, the expansin gene superfamily has undergone large-scale gene duplication, with many genes being retained after wgd events. mutations of duplicated genes, and the subsequent selection constraints on them, are expected to lead to functional divergence. at the molecular level, amino acid changes that result in reduced fitness are removed by negative selection, whereas changes that increase fitness are retained by positive selection  <cit> . through positive selection analysis, amino acid sites that have undergone strong positive selection  were also identified. finally, we identified seven sites  that were responsible for both functional divergence and positive selection, indicating that these sites were important in the evolutionary history of the expansin gene superfamily in soybean.

we used the swiss-model  <cit>  to model the three-dimensional structure of gmexpa <dig> through homology-modeling, and labeled the seven critical amino acid sites on it. the 3d structure shows that 172 l and 196p are located on the surface where two domains come into contact . compared with the crystal structure of zea m  <dig>  <cit> , we inferred that 172 l may be involved in the contact of the two domains of the expansin protein, because it corresponds to 164 l of zea m  <dig>  which is located in a hydrophobic patch associated with the contact of the two domains, based on clustal comparison of the two sequences. consequently, we inferred that the non-polar residue 196p might also be involved in the contact of the two domains. it has been speculated that domain ii is a polysaccharide-binding domain, based on the presence of conserved aromatic and polar residues on the surface of the protein  <cit> . interestingly, four critical amino acid sites  are located on the surface of the protein ; hence, 190s and 192 t might participate in polysaccharide binding.

while we did not map the other sites responsible for just functional divergence and positive selection in this study, we analyzed the location of these sites based on the 3d structure of gmexpa <dig> . the number of amino acid sites in domain ii  responsible for either functional divergence or positive selection was clearly considerably greater than that in domain i, indicating the conservation of domain i compared to domain ii. this difference might be associated with functional adaptiveness. previous studies have shown that pollen expbs  have a marked loosening action on the cell walls of grasses, but not those of dicots; however, the reverse is true for expas. therefore, the two forms of expansin appear to target different components of the cell wall  <cit> . consequently, the putative polysaccharide-binding domain  might have evolved to adapt to different components of the cell wall, thus promoting functional divergence and much faster evolution.

no sites responsible for functional divergence and positive selection were found in the c terminus, indicating that the c terminusis stringently conserved. in contrast, six amino acid sites responsible for functional divergence and three amino acid sites responsible for positive selection were found in the n terminus, indicating that this terminus contributes to functional divergence. in addition, the expansins of the n terminus are subject to variation, which might facilitate the adaptiveness of expansins for different functional needs. the n-terminal extension in expb <dig> from maize contained a motif  that was consistently found, with only minor variation, in group- <dig> grass pollen allergens, but not in other expbs  <cit> . while the function of this n-terminal extension is unknown, it may contribute to protein recognition, transport, packaging, and the processing of the pollen secretory apparatus  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
previous studies have demonstrated that members of the expansin gene family play important roles in cell enlargement and a variety of other developmental processes. the results of the present study indicate that both tandem and segmental duplication have contributed to the expansion of the expansin gene family in soybean. species-specific expansion characteristics were identified by comparing the expansion pattern of the expansin gene families in arabidopsis, soybean, and rice. segmental duplication seemed to be the predominant form of expansion for the expansin gene superfamilies of the two dicots, arabidopsis and soybean. in contrast, tandem duplication seemed to be the predominant form of expansion for the expansin gene family of the monocot, rice. furthermore, positive selection might be the main driving force for the functional divergence of duplicated genes, which might be critical for facilitating plant responses to various stressors throughout their evolutionary history. in addition, divergent selection constraints might have influenced the evolution of the four subfamilies. the results of this study are anticipated to further our understanding about the evolutionary processes of soybean expansin genes, and to help enhance functional genomic studies of expansins in an important model system.
