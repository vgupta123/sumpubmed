BACKGROUND
pregnancy is a state of oxidative stress arising from increased placental mitochondrial activity and production of reactive oxygen species , including nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, and peroxynitrite, which have pronounced effects on placental function including trophoblast proliferation and differentiation and vascular reactivity  <cit> . the oxidant/antioxidant status affects the entire unit mother-placenta-fetus, but the disturbance of which during pregnancy may be one of the key downstream mediators that initiate programming of the offspring  <cit> . excessive free radical production may cause both lipid and protein oxidation and impair normal endothelial cell function  <cit> . in this regard, oxidative stress and/or low intake of antioxidant involved in the etiopathogenesis of the most frequent disorders in the gestational period, which was closely related to reproductive performance of sows  <cit> . consequently, supplementation with antioxidant in sow’s diet during late gestation and lactation periods is necessary.

as a natural polysaccharide, cos is the depolymerized product of chitosan, and has good solubility in water and various biological activities, including immune-stimulant  <cit> , anti-inflammatory  <cit>  and antioxidant properties  <cit> . numerous studies have shown that chitosan has beneficial effects on relieving the oxidative stress  <cit> . moreover, placenta, as the main interface between the mother and the fetus, has many functions to perform, including producing and secrete hormones and cytokines, and mediatting the transfer of nutrients, oxygen and waste products  <cit> . nutrients pass from the maternal to the fetal blood across the syncytiotrophoblast and the endothelium of the fetal capillaries, therefore main determinant of fetal growth is placental nutrient transport, which is essential for fetal growth and development  <cit> . jansson et al.  found the pregnant rats subjected to protein malnutrition during gestation down-regulated placental amino acid transport, which may contribute directly to the development of iugr  <cit> .

our previous study has found that maternal cos supplement increased birth weight and growth rate of piglets  <cit> , and postpartum upregulates cholesterol accumulation in suckling piglets  <cit> . therefore, we hypothesised that supplementation with cos in sow diets could affect the function of the placenta. the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of maternal supplementation with cos during late gestation on the antioxidant defense capacity and the amino acids transport in placenta.

discussion
it has been shown that pregnant sows had elevated oxidative stress during late gestation  <cit> . oxidative damage is a strong indicator of health status and wellbeing of animals in relation to stress, nutritional status, and disease. increased oxidative stress is responsible for impaired milk production, reproductive performance, and finally longevity of sows  <cit> . antioxidant defenses can be enzymatic and non-enzymatic, and enzymatic defense includes sod, cat and gsh-px, which act as a major part of antioxidant system  <cit> .

increased defense against oxidative stress of sows during gestation by supplementing with cos in diet was confirmed by an increase in total sod activity. sod is responsible for degrading superoxide radical into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, which is then degraded by cat. cos treatment could effectively increase the sod level, a natural power that can be quickly used by the cells as a defense against oxidative stress  <cit> . oxidative stress is described as an imbalance in the production of reactive oxygen species  and the ability of antioxidant defenses to scavenge them  <cit> . as the key ros metabolic biomarker, mda is from a series of reactions during lipid peroxidation caused by ros  <cit> . the plasma mda in the cos group, at least, partially was for the release of antioxidant enzymes, which scavenged excessive ros. from the results of plasma analysis on d  <dig> of gestation, we concluded that cos supplementation could improve anti-oxidative capacity of pregnant sows.

the placenta appears particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress because of its extensive cell division and high metabolic activity  <cit> . ros accumulation in placenta is limited by a range of major antioxidant, including mn and cu/zn-sod, cat, gsh, gsh-px, and vitamins c and e are present in the placenta  <cit> . although these antioxidants, such as vitamins e, c and β-carotenes, could transfer via placenta during the last days of gestation, the antioxidant system is still insufficient to scavenge the excessive ros  <cit> . the relative mrna levels of cu/zn-sod and cat in the placenta were significantly increased by cos supplement, which was similar to the results of plasma mda content and total sod activity during gestation. however, inconsistent results were observed in the contents of total sod and cat, which may be explained that cos supplementation just increased the transcription level of some antioxidant genes in the placenta of sows without severe oxidative stress.

previous study reported ucp2-null mice showed increased ros production in several cell types including macrophages  <cit>  and adipocytes  <cit> , indicating that mitochondrial ucp <dig> may limit oxidative stress by reducing ros production. it is unknown, however, whether ucp <dig> plays a similar role in placental tissue remains to be established. jones et al.  found that dexamethasone reduced ucp <dig> expression of placenta in the rat during late gestation in labyrinth zone  <cit> , and is consistent with similar effects observed in bovine mammary epithelial cell cultures  <cit> . consequently, the lower mrna level of ucp <dig> in the cos group may serve to enhance antioxidant protection in the late gestation placenta, and impact on placental nutrient metabolism, especially at times of increased energy demand  <cit> .

other than reduced ucp <dig> expression, the major pro-inflammatory il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and il-1β were decreased or presented a downtrend. similar results were observed in rats  <cit> , and mice  <cit> . several studies reported that oxidative stress status in obese women during pregnancy was always associated with a pro-inflammatory state  <cit> . hsp <dig> have been implicated in stress regulation, including heat shock, oxidative stress, and other environmental stresses  <cit> . in line with the relative expression of il- <dig> and il- <dig>  the relative mrna expression of hsp <dig> in placenta had a downtrend in the cos group, which was consistent with previous study that activation of hsp <dig> could mitigates inflammatory response of kidney  <cit> . these observation clearly indicated that cos supplementation in sow’s diet contributed reducing placental oxidative stress and inflammatory response, enhanced anti-oxidant defense capacity of placenta.

it has been demonstrated that mtor is a central integrator of various signals, such as growth factors, nutrients, energy, and stress  <cit> . as an essential serine/threonine kinase, mtor is a central regulator of cell growth and proliferation, which can directly phosphorylates the ribosomal p70s6k and the initiation factor 4e-bp <dig> to initiate translation of distinct mrnas  <cit> . for example, stimulating mtor signaling pathway could increase protein synthesis, and decrease protein degradation in porcine conceptus trophectoderm cells  <cit>  and porcine enterocytes  <cit> . it has been shown that mtor/4ebp <dig> could offer cellular protection during oxidant stress, and knockdown of 4ebp <dig> induces oxidative stress-induced apoptosis through a caspase-dependent pathway in human endothelial progenitor cells  <cit> . consequently, the abundance of mtor/4ebp <dig> may be the result of lower oxidative stress by cos supplementation in sow’s diet, and p70s6k being relative independent on the mtor pathway in this study.

the mtor pathway is regulated by a multitude of intracellular and extracellular signals, and is inhibited by hypoxia  <cit> , then significantly reduces the activity of placental amino acid transporters  <cit> . snat <dig> and pat are important amino acid transporters in stimulating mtor pathway  <cit> . in the present study, we found that the relative mrna levels of most of amino acid transporter eaat <dig>  pat <dig>  pat <dig> and asct <dig> in the cos group were increased or presented uptrend compared with that in the control group, which was consistent with previous report that mtor increased total amino acid transporter gene expression with enhanced surface expression in mouse lymphoma cells, and the great expression of amino acid transporter increased the mtor activity  <cit> . these observations are in line with our hypothesis that the mtor pathway in the placenta functions as a nutrient sensing pathway.

it has been shown that inhibiting the phosphorylation of mtor down-regulated the plgf mrna level   <cit> . in agreement with previous study, the relative mrna level of vegf-a in placenta was increased by cos supplementing. during pregnancy, vegf-a protein increases in the maternal circulation during pregnancy in humans  <cit>  and mice  <cit> . it has been shown that it was sufficient to cause embryonic lethality when the mrna level of vegf-a fall by half  <cit> . furthermore, vegf-a gene deletion in the conceptus itself may result in alteration placental gene expression, reduced fetal body weight, and higher maternal cardiac output  <cit> . in this study, cos supplement significantly increased the vegf-a mrna level in placenta, indicating that supplementation with cos in sow diets could affect fetal development by stimulating mtor pathway, involved in vegf-a.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, these observations suggested that maternal dietary supplementation with cos protected sows against oxidative stress by increasing plasma antioxidants and blocking inflammatory response, which may contribute to promoting placental amino acids transport by activating mtor signaling pathway. consequently, cos supplementation during late gestation may be an effective means in conforming the health of pregnant sows and nutrition transport from sows to fetus.
