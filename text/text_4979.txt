BACKGROUND
cell volume regulation occurs in a wide variety of tissues from kidney to brain  <cit> . although much is known about ion and water fluxes involved in many regulatory processes, no method has so far been designed to investigate potential volume changes in moving cells. light microscopy enables one to estimate the cellular volume via different techniques, ranging from extrapolation on the basis of the width and length of the cell  <cit> , changes in light intensity and light scattering  <cit> , various staining techniques  <cit>  to quantitative phase microscopy  <cit> . all these techniques fail when it is required to investigate the volume of a cell undergoing notable changes in shape such as occur during cell migration  <cit>  since they require constant parameters such as height or refractive index and some have additional disadvantages such as bleaching of the dye  <cit> .

a promising approach to circumvent these problems is to measure volume directly with a scanning probe microscope. direct measurements of cellular volume have been performed by scanning ion conductance microscopy  on cellular layers  <cit>  and single cells  <cit>  and by atomic force microscopy  on living and fixed cells  <cit> . the volume determined by sicm of cells forming a confluent layer has been validated by scanning confocal laser microscopy  <cit> .

volume determination by scanning probe microscopy assumes that cells are closely attached to the substrate and is mostly based on the height of every observed pixel  <cit> . when trying to investigate the volume dynamics of the somata of bipolar cells such as oligodendrocyte precursor cells , the dimensions as well as the lateral resolution of the scan have to be restricted in order to obtain an acceptable temporal resolution. for the investigation of neural cells exhibiting long extensions most scanning frames inevitably crop the extended cellular ramifications. this leads to errors in the volume determination of migrating cells since the fraction of the processes located within the scanning frame may vary in successively obtained recordings, as for the process located on the right side in figure  <dig> 

we have previously proposed a method for distinguishing between cellular somata and processes during investigations of the surface of oligodendrocyte cell bodies at different developmental stages  <cit> . here, every pixel exceeding a certain height was assigned to the cell soma. in cells undergoing marked changes in shape this method fails since it would result in different soma volumes if a cell flattens but performs a compensatory widening thus maintaining its volume. hence, to estimate volume changes of single bipolar cell somata changing their shape and position we have now developed a novel procedure that allows us to separate the cell soma volume from the extended peripheral membrane processes of bipolar cells.

RESULTS
the boundary delimitation algorithm  for approximating the basal area of the cell soma of bipolar cells was divided into four steps as depicted in figure  <dig>  opcs in culture generally have two long processes at opposite poles of an ellipsoidal soma, and move in the direction of one of them. whereas a single image does not allow the identification of the direction of movement it still allows the determination of the direction of the processes. we call this the "heading direction" of the cell. as the first step of the bda the heading direction of the bipolar cell, indicated by the angle drawn in figure 2a, was estimated and subsequently the cell rotated in order to position the heading direction of the cell parallel to the abscissa . second, the cell was divided into its front and rear parts at the level of the nucleus. third, starting at the nucleus, the contour of the soma was approximated by linewise  fitting of polynomials to the data for the frontal and the rear parts of the cell separately. the root of the fit for every single line, indicated by the red dot in figure 2c, was used to delimit the cell soma from the cell processes . a compressed archive of the matlab functions used to perform the bda as detailed in the following is available as additional file  <dig> 

approximation of the position of the nucleus
atomic force microscopy measurements on hippocampal neurons revealed that the higher parts of the cell body form a harder structure and correspond most likely to the nucleus  <cit> . in order to determine a single point that represents the location of the nucleus the following procedure was employed: we stained the nucleus using hoechst  <dig> dye and recorded an epifluorescence as well as a phase contrast image.

subsequently an sicm scan was performed and the relative position of the sicm scan was determined within the micrograph  <cit> . we then investigated the distance of the centroid of different horizontal sections through the sicm scans to the centroid of the hoechst-stained nucleus. the horizontal sections consisted of the areas that were covered by pixels pi =   exceeding a certain height t zmax, where t denotes a predefined threshold and zmax denotes the maximum cell height. to calculate the position of the centroid ct we reduced the z-coordinates of pi to boolean values zt,i = . the square brackets indicate a heaviside-like function that yields  <dig> if the enclosed condition is true and  <dig> otherwise  <cit> . furthermore, we assumed constant step sizes between the pixels and thus calculated the x-coordinate of ct, , as:   

 was calculated in the same manner.

we next investigated the distance between ct and the centroid of the hoechst  <dig> staining of the nucleus  for various thresholds t.

estimation of the heading direction of the cell
opcs display a bipolar phenotype terminating in two cell processes that are most commonly originating from the opposite ends of the cell soma. this enables one to approximate the heading direction θh of an opc by rotating a straight line   

through c <dig> as the approximation of a straight line through the nucleus. in order to determine the heading direction of the cell we considered the arcs from each pixel representing the cell to y let ϕi denote the smallest angle between pi and y and ri denote the distance from c <dig> to pi. then the length si of the corresponding arc is calculated as si = ϕiri. figure 4a illustrates the relations between the introduced angles, lines and points for two different pixels pi located at opposite sides of c <dig>  we now defined the angle θh, that minimized the sum of si  and thus matched the condition   

as the heading direction of the cell. here we assumed that pixels that exhibited a height of ≤ <dig> μm represented the cell culture dish rather than the cell. equation  was solved numerically by testing all angles  <dig> ≤ θ ≤ π in steps of ∆θ = 2π/ <dig> 

rotating and interpolating the data
after determining the heading direction of the cell data were rotated in order to position the cell parallel to the abscissa and translated such that c <dig> was shifted into the origin of the new coordinate system. we denote the axes of the new coordinate system as x'-, y'- and z'- axes and a rotated and translated pixel as , with j indicating the number of the pixel in the rotated scan. to determine the lateral extent of the rotated scan we considered the distances of the vertices of the original scan and y  or a straight line through c <dig> perpendicular to y  as illustrated in figure 4c. since the approximation of the single line boundaries of the cell soma required lines of data points parallel to the heading direction of the cell, we defined the grid consisting of the projections  of qj to the x', y' plane of the rotated and translated scan such that   

here  is the negative representation of the length  as a coordinate, Δx and Δy denote the step sizes of the original scan in the x- and y-directions, respectively, and the truncated square brackets represent the ceil and the floor functions  <cit> .

to obtain the z'- coordinate of a pixel qj we rotated its projection  into the original scan dataset by applying the inverse rotation matrix   

and subsequently re-translated it by . we refer to the resulting projection as . if  was located outside the original scan, we defined . otherwise we considered the four projections   that surrounded  as depicted in figure 5b. the z-coordinates of the corresponding pixels were known from the original data. each set of three out of these four projections defines a triangle as indicated by the dotted lines in figure 5b. in the following we refer to the four triangles as mk  and to the vertices of one triangle as  with l =  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  we selected l such that the right angle was located at  and furthermore such that  and . an example is shown in figure 5c. if and only if  was located inside mk the sum ζk of the angles at  to the vertices of mk amounted to 2π  <cit> .

we next considered the plane defined by the pixels mk,l that corresponded to the projections . the z-value zk of this plane at a position  is given by   

we now interpolated  as the average of  if  was located inside mk :   

approximation of the contour of a single data row
to trace the contour of the cell soma and thus to crop the processes we now considered every data row  separately. the corresponding y'-values were defined by equation . figure  <dig> shows sketches of the contours of two characteristic cell shapes; an almost circular cell body that is easy to distinguish from the cell processes  and a cell soma that protruded into the direction of one of the extensions . thus, as indicated in figure 6b, we assumed that a polynomial of third degree was convenient to approximate the cell soma contour but still suitable to crop the cell process.

to approximate both ends of the cell within a single data row at a fixed y'-level we subdivided the data into positive and negative, or frontal and rear, parts with respect to the corresponding x'-coordinates. in the following we describe the fitting procedure for the positive part, thus x' >  <dig>   was defined as the projection of qj to the x', z'-plane and furthermore  with p =  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> ... as the set of projections at a constant y' such that for all p >  <dig>   

furthermore, we defined  such that . this definition only included pixels with non zero z'-coordinates . in general n +  <dig> data points are needed to fit a polynomial of nth degree . furthermore, we assumed that the cell body is represented by the data points whose x'-coordinates are located close to zero. thus we additionally tested whether there was no gap within  and it therefore matched the condition   

otherwise, data points with x'-coordinates close to zero existed with z' =  <dig>  this most likely occured at the borders of the cell soma in ± y'-direction and was treated as a special case described later in this section.

to fit a polynomial of nth degree to the data we used the function fit from matlab's curve fitting toolbox that implements a least square algorithm  <cit> . it provides, among others, the value  that represents the goodness of the fit considering the number of data points that were approximated by the fit. we investigated the goodness of the fits to an increasing number r of data points. we refer to the subset of sy' that contains the first r elements as  and we denote the goodness of the fit to sr,y' as  additionally, we defined xy' to be the smallest, positive, non-complex root of the polynomial  that was determined by the function fit. we approximated the polynomial boundary of the cell soma for each line segment towards the direction of fitting as the xy' that matched the condition   

with r = n +  <dig>  n +  <dig> ..., pmax. here pmax denotes the largest index p of the projections included in sy' figure  <dig> shows examples of the fitting procedure for r =  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, with n =  <dig>  hence fitting polynomials of third degree. for r =  <dig> and r =  <dig>  fy' had no real root with a corresponding positive x'-coordinate, thus these fits were not taken into consideration. since   xy'  was used to approximate the cell soma boundary at the corresponding y'-level. note that the goodness of the fit to s <dig> y' was larger than those of all other fits that exhibited xy' but are not shown in figure  <dig> for clarity.

if the procedure failed to determine a cell soma boundary for the investigated set of data points sy' no r with a corresponding x y'  existed. we then defined the boundary to be xy' , if it existed. note that  is not defined  <cit> . if xy'  did also not exist we repeated the procedure with n : = n -  <dig> as long as n >  <dig>  thus fitting polynomials of a reduced degree. in all cases investigated this procedure led to detection of bordering pixels.

special cases of the fitting procedure
as indicated in figure  <dig> an error was returned if the investigated set of data points did not match the conditions listed in equation . in this case data points with a corresponding  existed within the first n +  <dig> data points in the fit direction. this most likely occurred at the borders of the cell soma in ± y'-direction. this special situation might occur under two conditions. in the first case the cell body approximates to a circular shape causing the boundary perpendicular to the direction of fitting to consist of only a few pixels. furthermore, the number of pixels available to the fitting procedure as depicted in figure  <dig> is decreased by the division of the cell into its frontal and its rear part. secondly, opcs in a later stage of development might exhibit small additional extensions that grow perpendicularly to the heading direction.

it was important to consider these cases in order to provide an errorless and thus automatic processing of the data. there are different strategies to determine the boundary of the cell soma at these locations depending either on the chosen degree of the polynomial fitted to sy' as well as whether potential extensions at these sides of the cell soma should be included or excluded from the soma approximation. the most restrictive and simple solution would be to omit and thus to crop these lines.

to obtain a more accurate fit and to include potential cell extensions at these sides we introduced three more functions: fitonepoint, fittwopoints and fitthreepoints that were executed depending on the number of data points with z' >  <dig>  we considered the set of pixels  that matched all conditions listed in equation  except one: the z'-coordinate was not tested, thus ty' might also include projections with z' =  <dig>  let  be the number of projections with a z'-coordinate exceeding zero. if n =  <dig> we executed the function fitbest. if n =  <dig>  n =  <dig> or n =  <dig> we executed the functions fitonepoint, fittwopoints or fitthreepoints, respectively. note that these functions might result in more than one boundary for the particular y' level, thus the resulting approximated cell soma might appear jagged.

the simplest case is n =  <dig> and the corresponding function fitonepoint. we refer to the non-zero data point as  and used the roots of a parabola through  as the boundary if u <  <dig>  otherwise the line was cropped.

let the two non-zero projections be  and  with u <v in the case of n =  <dig> . we first considered the case v - u =  <dig>  hence, the two points were neighbors. we fitted a polynomial of third degree to  and  and used its roots as the boundary in this case except if v =  <dig> and . in the latter case we cropped the structure assuming that it did not belong to the cell soma.

if v - u >  <dig> we only assigned  to the cell soma and approximated the contour of the cell soma by the roots of the parabola through  as in the function fitonepoint.

the most complicated case was n =  <dig>  we refer to the single projection with zero z'-coordinate as  in this case the approximation was performed differently for varying values of u. if u =  <dig> we considered the z'-coordinate of the projection . if  we assumed that the cell soma exhibited an asymmetric shape and applied the function fitbest. otherwise, if  we approximated the cell soma boundary for the particular y' by the roots of a polynomial of third degree fitted to .

if u ∈ { <dig>  3} we applied fitonepoint to the single, non-zero projection and fittwopoints to the two neighboring non-zero projections, respectively. if u =  <dig> we considered the z'-coordinate of the first point opposite to the direction of fitting, . if  we applied fitbest, otherwise we approximated the cell soma boundary at the current y'-level by the roots of a polynomial of third degree fitted to .

approximation of the volume of the cell soma
to approximate the cell soma volume we summed the z-coordinates of every pixel located within the approximated boundaries of the cell soma. this required that the height of every pixel located within the approximated cell soma boundary was known. hence, if a single delimitation of the cell soma was located outside the original scan we were not able to approximate the cell soma volume and the recording was discarded. this happened if the cell body was in part located outside of the sicm image or very close to its borders.

evaluation of the procedure
to evaluate the bda we simulated objects of known volume and applied the morphometric fitting procedure to investigate any potential effect of geometry on the volume determinations. we have previously determined the restrictions of scan size and resolution for the successful investigation of migrating opcs  <cit> . in brief, to image migrating opcs with a suitable frame rate using our present sicm the dimensions of the recordings had to be restricted to  <dig> μm squares with a lateral step size of  <dig> μm, limiting the sicm images to  <dig> pixels.

we first applied the bda to a hemisphere with a radius of r <dig> =  <dig> pixels  in a data set consisting of  <dig> pixels as depicted in figure 9a. the volume vcomp computed by the bda  was the same as the volume vsum calculated by summing the volume of the columns above each pixel.

we next compared the determination of the volume of an half-ellipsoid with the two methods. a possible effect of the direction of fitting was tested by applying the bda to an ellipsoid defined by the three radii rx, ry and rz with rx > ry and vice versa, as depicted in figure 9b and 9c . again, no difference was found between vcomp and vsum.

to investigate whether the bda in principle allows one to determine the volume of an object that flattens but maintains its volume by a compensatory widening we computed the volumes of an ellipsoid defined by the radii ry = r <dig>  rx = t r <dig> and rz = r0/t with  <dig> ≤ t ≤  <dig> in step sizes of Δt =  <dig> . figure 9g  shows the computed volume normalized to vsum for every investigated value of t. there is no difference between vcomp and vsum, thus vn =  <dig>  in contrast, the computed volume did not match vsum when it was determined by using the method that every pixel exceeding a predefined threshold was assigned to the cell soma  <cit> . the normalized volumes are displayed in figure 9g  for an absolute and a relative threshold. in the following we only consider the determination using a relative threshold since it is clearly visible that the use of an absolute threshold leads to increasing differences in the determination of the soma with increasing elongation of the ellipsoid. additionally, we observed no difference in the volume determined by the bda and vsum when varying ry instead of rx or when varying both lateral radii by defining rx = ry = t1/ <dig> r <dig> 

to simulate a bipolar cell we added extensions in ± x'-direction to a hemisphere of radius r <dig> as well as to the ellipsoids. images of the resulting objects are depicted in figure 9d-f. the height of the extension was chosen as r0/ <dig> and its width as  <dig> r0/ <dig>  every z-value at the corresponding positions was adjusted to r0/ <dig> if the z-value calculated by equation   was below r0/ <dig>  this avoids a gap between the half-ellipsoid and the extension but also increases the z-value of some pixels of the half-ellipsoid such that the volume differs from the volume vsum computed by summing the z-values of the mere half-ellipsoid as depicted in figure 9i. to our knowledge no exact definition exists describing where the cell soma ends and the cell process starts. at positions where the soma merges into the neurite a gradual decline of the soma and a corresponding increase of soma volume most likely occurs .

here we chose to use the calculated volume of the half-ellipsoid without extension as reference. since we calculated the soma volume by summing all z-values corresponding to pixels within the approximated soma boundary an overestimation of the soma volume at positions merging into the neurites  could be induced by the bda.

the approximated volume, normalized to vsum of the corresponding hemisphere or ellipsoid without extension, is shown in figure 9h. as expected, the bda  overestimates the volume with respect to vsum. in contrast, the approximation via the threshold method  <cit> , in this case applied using a threshold of r0/ <dig>  underestimates the volume with respect to vsum since it omits all sections of the ellipsoid with a height below the selected threshold. putative cell shape changes as depicted in figure 9e-g would result in detections of relative soma volumes as indicated in the gray boxes in figure 9h. erroneous changes due to different shapes are indicated by the arrows. both methods lead to almost similar errors  in the determination of soma volume changes.

since it is unlikely that the shape of the soma changes while the extensions maintain their shape we next investigated the impact of changes in the shape of the extensions. figure 10a shows the volume determined by the bda when applied to a hemisphere with adjacent extensions  of varying relative height h r <dig>  normalized to vsum of the hemisphere without extensions. as expected from the result shown in figure 9h, our method overestimates the volume with increasing height. an increase in the height of the extension from h =  <dig>  to h =  <dig>  results in an erroneous detection of a soma volume increase of about 6%. although the relation seems to be linear in the depicted range, it is more complex: a threefold increase in the height of the extension from h =  <dig>  to h =  <dig>  leads to an erroneous detection of a volume increase of about 9% whereas a threefold increase from h =  <dig>  to h =  <dig>  leads to an erroneous detection of a volume increase of about 3%. in contrast, the thresholding method  shows an underestimation of the soma volume that increases stepwise but maintains a constant volume over a range of heights. however, the stepwise decrease of the calculated volume and thus the determination of a constant volume over a certain range of heights results from the imprecision that occurs due to the rasterization of the sphere as shown by the investigation of a simulated scan with a tenfold resolution . an increase in the height of the extension from h =  <dig>  to h =  <dig>  results in an erroneous detection of a volume decrease of about 16% for the low resolution simulation and of 32% in the high resolution simulation. we observed similar results when performing the same investigation on the objects depicted in figure 9f and 9g with only slight differences in the amount of errors determined by the two methods.

we used h r <dig> as threshold in these investigations. note that the height of the processes of a live cell is much more difficult to determine due to the more complex and irregular shape and thus adds additional uncertainties to the determination of the soma volume.

application to live cells
we next applied the bda to determine soma volumes in sicm recordings of live cells that exhibited both a much more irregular shape than the simulated objects as well as extensions that might be more difficult to distinguish from the cell soma. the corresponding data is available as additional file  <dig>  figure  <dig> shows the results of the bda applied to four different opcs from rat brain. note that the cells were positioned along the diagonal of the scan field in order to include as many details of the cell ramifications as possible. whereas the cell somata depicted in figure  <dig> aa and ba approximate a circular shape the opcs shown in figure  <dig> ca and da exhibited a more elongated cell soma that merged into one of the processes. the determination of the heading direction of the opc shown in figure  <dig> aa selected the direction of the major process. note that this might not be true when the fraction of the minor process that is located within the scan area notably exceeds the fraction of the major process. this might not impair the determination of the cell soma from a single scan but might have an impact when investigating the soma volume of a cell that migrates along the major process.

in the second recording the cell changed its shape to be more circular and thus the determined basal area of the cell soma only shows a slight expansion as clearly visible by the comparison of figure 12ab and 12bb. note that it is known that migrating opcs show an average velocity of  <dig> μm/h  <cit>  and that migrating opcs show notable changes in shape  <cit> . the detailed analysis of the parameters of the cell shape and soma shows that the cell swelled by approximately 29% and that this swelling was dominated by an increase in cell height whereas the length of the soma decreased. most notably, this challenges the method to approximate the volume of a cell from light microscopic images by interpolation via the width and the length of its soma. this approximation, in contrast, would detect a slight cell shrinkage since the basal area covered by the cell soma was reduced as depicted in figure 12e. the separate consideration of the frontal and rear soma volume by dividing the cell soma at the level of c <dig> perpendicular to y  yields that the volume increase is dominated by an increase in the frontal volume . figure 12f summarizes the changes in the lateral dimensions as well as the changes of area and volume between both scans.

CONCLUSIONS
we provide a new algorithm to approximate the basal area of the cell soma for volume determinations of bipolar cells undergoing temporal changes in shape. simulations show that this method provides smaller errors in the detection of soma volume changes in moving cells than the method to separate soma areas from neurites via height thresholds  <cit> . we show that the algorithm can be applied successfully to detect soma volume changes of living oligodendrocyte precursor cells. additionally we demonstrate that the approximation of the volume using two-dimensional data such as cell body length and width may lead to erroneous results.
