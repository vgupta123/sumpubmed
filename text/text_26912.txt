BACKGROUND
complex behaviours are likely to be generated in part by how, where, when and by how much proteins are involved in neurotransmission. a key to understanding how such expression patterns are generated is to identify transcriptional regulatory domains for a particular gene. comparative genetics allows the identification of such domains  <cit>  and in this communication we have applied such a strategy to identify regulatory domains of the dopamine receptor d <dig> . the drd <dig> gene is involved in the regulation of social and cognitive phenotype of modern humans and it is preferentially expressed in the prefrontal and cingulate cortices  <cit> , key centres for processing of complex behaviour and cognition. in these regions, the drd <dig> protein acts as a regulator of dopamine levels, where mis-expression of drd <dig> has also been associated with the onset of cognitive, behavioural and personality disorders e.g., shyness, adhd, addiction and parkinson's disease  <cit> . several polymorphisms exhibiting cis regulatory properties have been identified in this gene. however, in spite of the interest in the drd <dig> gene and its potential importance for pharmacogenetics, the regulatory machinery behind appropriate spatial-temporal gene expression remains to be elucidated.

genome sequencing of diverse vertebrate species has permitted comparisons that reveal strong conservation of non-coding regions  between distantly related vertebrate species . such conservation has been suggested to indicate that a given ecr could act as either a cis regulator of gene expression, alter post-transcriptional modifications or both  <cit> . in vertebrates ecrs have been identified in many genes involved in development  <cit>  and behaviour  <cit> .

to search for ecrs that may play a role in regulating the drd <dig> gene expression, we conducted a multiple comparison of  <dig> vertebrate genomes at this locus using the ucsc browser . the transcriptional activity of the most conserved ecr  identified at the drd <dig> locus was tested in vitro. here we assessed the ability of this ecr fragment to support luciferase reporter gene expression in primary cultures of rat neonate cortical tissue. these cells were chosen for the analyses because prefrontal cortex  neurons have been reported to express the endogenous drd <dig> gene during prenatal and early postnatal development in modern humans  <cit> . the expression of the drd <dig> gene was also confirmed by rtpcr of cdna extracted from tissue sections .

furthermore, we assessed whether this d4ecr <dig> was subject to regulation by sp <dig>  a transcription factor which has multiple potential consensus sequences in this ecr and has been suggested as a candidate regulator for drd <dig> gene expression  <cit> . our data demonstrate that this bioinformatics approach is capable of identifying regulatory domains and the transcription factors that modulate them.

RESULTS
identification of an ecr in the drd <dig> gene of mammals
examination of the drd <dig> gene and flanking regions using the  <dig> way most conserved option of the conservation tool on the ucsc browser  revealed the presence of one strong ecr in its first intron . location is shown in figure 1a.

examination of the peak of conservation generated showed that a highly homologous sequence to that of the human d4ecr <dig> was found in  <dig> other  mammalian genomes: pan troglodytes , macaca mulatta , mus musculus , rattus norvegicus , cavia porcellus , echinops telfairi  and canis familiaris . due to the lack of sequencing across the d4ecr <dig> locus other vertebrate genomes, it was impossible to determine if this sequence was conserved across vertebrates.

the tfbs in the mammalian d4ecr <dig> sequences were identified by alibaba  <dig>  . briefly, alibaba is a program for predicting binding sites of transcription factors in an unknown dna sequence; it uses the binding sites collected in transfac . this analysis identified  <dig> conserved binding sites for different types of tfs between the human and mouse d4ecr <dig> . these tfs include: sp <dig>  gata <dig>  ap2alpha, oct <dig>  nf <dig>  gr and t3ralpha, whereby the most common binding site found in the d4ecr <dig> sequence was for the tf sp <dig> .

functional analysis of the human d4ecr <dig> demonstrated its ability to support differential luciferase expression in cultures of neonate frontal cortex
the potential transcriptional activity of a dna fragment including the human d4ecr <dig> was validated in a reporter gene assay . the d4ecr1p construct was able to act as an enhancer of pgl3p reporter gene expression in primary cultures of frontal cortex obtained from  <dig> and  <dig> day old male wistar rats. in these cell cultures, the activity supported by the d4ecr1p  was significantly higher than that supported by the unmodified pgl3p control plasmid .

d4ecr <dig> enhancer activity is regulated by overexpression of sp <dig> in vitro
the identification of multiple sp <dig> sites in the d4ecr <dig> sequence  may be of importance because this tf has been previously found to bind other proposed cis regulators of the human drd <dig> gene  <cit> . the co-transfection experiment  demonstrated that overexpression of sp <dig> can modulate the enhancer activity of d4ecr1p in dissociated cultures of neonate rat frontal cortex at age  <dig> days, whereby both concentrations of sp <dig> tested had a repressing effect on the transcriptional activity of the d4ecr1p.

in the graph the basal transcriptional activities of the d4ecr1p and pgl3p plasmids were normalised to 100% to express the effect of co-transfecting with sp <dig> as percentages of repression. in brief, sp <dig> was found to repress the activity of both the unmodified pgl3p and d4ecr1p constructs; however, this effect was only statistically significant for the d4ecr1p. . there was no significant difference in the levels of repression of d4ecr1p induced by the two concentrations of sp <dig>  in brief,  <dig>  μg of sp <dig> repressed the d4ecr1p activity in  <dig> %  and  <dig> μg of sp <dig> repressed d4ecr1p activity in  <dig> % .

discussion
this study aimed to identify potential transcriptionally active non-coding ecrs in the drd <dig> gene locus of mammals, using a comparative genomic analysis complemented and validated by reporter gene analysis. the analyses conducted demonstrated that there is at least one ecr in the drd <dig> gene of mammals  that exhibited transcriptional activity in frontal cortex cultures of neonate rat . furthermore, in our analyses the activity of the d4ecr1p construct was reduced in these cells when the tf sp <dig>  predicted to bind to the d4ecr <dig>  was over-expressed .

the results suggest that d4ecr <dig> could act as a regulator of drd <dig> gene expression in the cns. analysis of the in vitro regulatory role of the human d4ecr1p construct  showed that it supported high levels of reporter gene expression in cultures of neonate rat frontal cortex. we observed  that the transcriptional effects of the d4ecr1p were distinct in the cultures obtained from rats at different ages. this might be relevant as dopaminergic activity and drd <dig> mrna levels fluctuate during the first days of postnatal development in the cerebral cortex of rats  <cit> .

drd <dig> expression in the prefrontal cortex is constantly being modified in vivo in early postnatal development as demonstrated by previous reports . thus, it is possible that the d4ecr <dig> could be one domain that mediates such differences in regulation at this time, however there any many other regulators and domains that are likely to contribute to drd <dig> expression. the variation in the activity of the d4ecr1p at these times is likely to be caused by interaction with transcription and growth factors differentially expressed during this period of development. coincidentally, the expression of sp <dig> has also been documented to fluctuate in the first days of postnatal development in the rat cerebral cortex  <cit> .

the factors potentially binding to the d4ecr <dig> sequence  indicate potential regulatory pathways operating on d4ecr <dig>  in the present study, the tf with the highest number of binding sites found in the d4ecr <dig> sequence by alibaba  <dig>  was sp <dig> . potential sp <dig> binding sites have previously been reported in various positions within the human drd <dig> locus including: the  <dig> bp duplication and  <dig> bp deletion in the 5' region  <cit> ; upstream of the promoter region  <cit>  and in the  <dig> bp vntr of the 3rd exon  <cit> . the binding of sp <dig> to some of these elements has been confirmed in vitro by emsa  <cit> . furthermore, sp <dig> was found to be expressed in the frontal cortex of neonate rats and has been implicated in the regulation of dopaminergic systems in the rat brain  <cit> . for all these reason we addressed sp <dig> regulation of d4ecr <dig>  the results indicate that the d4ecr1p described here is also responsive to sp <dig> and could either individually, or in concert with the other predicted sp <dig> regulated domains in the drd <dig> gene modulate its expression . however, sp <dig> is not the only transcription factor that is predicted to modulate function directed by d4ecr <dig> and further work is required to address how these might interact to modulate the enhancer function.

CONCLUSIONS
the drd <dig> gene harbours a non-coding ecr region in its first intron which exhibits characteristics of a cis regulator of gene expression in mammalian neurons. furthermore, combination of comparative genomics and in vitro assays can be very helpful to identify novel regulatory elements in genes relevant to behavioural disorders and the transcription factors that regulate their function
