BACKGROUND
burkholderia cepacia complex  bacterial species are β-proteobacteria that can be found in various environments including freshwater and plant rhizosphere. they are also the etiological agents of several human infections. this bacterial complex includes several closely related species or genomovars of burkholderia that can be isolated from cystic fibrosis  patients. these species can also be found in nosocomial infections. b. cenocepacia  is a species of the bcc that can lead to the "cepacia syndrome", a dramatic necrotizing pneumonia . three major b. cenocepacia epidemic clones have been described around the world: et <dig>  phdc and midwest  <cit> . three strains of these clonal complexes  were sequenced by the sanger institute and the joint genome institute, and are available on their respective web site. several other bcc and burkholderia strains were sequenced or are in progress of getting sequenced .

the ability at colonizing several biotopes is a character observed in the bcc but also among other bacterial species like pseudomonas aeruginosa of the γ-proteobacteria. this versatility has been linked to an important diversity of regulatory processes including those of the σ <dig> gene family  <cit> . transcriptional σ <dig> factors can bind reversibly to eubacterial dna-dependent rna polymerase  to form the holoenzyme, and enable its promoter-specific attachment. this holoenzyme can drive synthesis of mrna . through evolution, selective pressures seem to have favoured the emergence of several paralogous lineages of σ <dig>  and these factors became a central component of bacterial adaptability to changing environments including host colonization. this resulted in the observation of some sort of relation between the lifestyle of bacteria and the number of genes encoding σ <dig> factors in their genome. for example,  <dig> σ <dig> gene sequences were detected among the genome of streptomyces coelicolor  <cit>  which is ubiquitous and morphologically complex but only one in mycoplasma spp. which are host- and disease-specific  <cit> . among pseudomonas aeruginosa, a species sharing several niches with the bcc,  <dig> σ <dig> gene sequences have been reported  <cit> . generally speaking, σ <dig> factors can be divided into four groups according to sequence similarities and promoter-recognition specificities  <cit> :  the essential primary sigma factors, involved mainly in exponential growth, and the alternative actinomycetal sigma factors;  the stationary phase factors;  the factors involved in sporangium development, flagellin synthesis and heat shock response, and  the extracytoplasmic function sigma factors . all these factors are in competition for the same rnap core enzyme  <cit> . genes under the control of a same sigma factor are termed to be part of a same sigmulon.

here, we report the first global analysis of the σ <dig> gene family among the burkholderia cepacia complex. the first fully sequenced bcc genome of b. cenocepacia  was used as the reference sequence for this study.

RESULTS
detection and number of σ <dig> gene sequences in bcen-j <dig> genome
σ  <dig> tblastn searches of b. cenocepacia strain j <dig>  genome sequence were performed. first, searches making use of ten σ <dig> factors of the main groups of this family were carried out. then, a second round of tblastn searches using all b. cenocepacia factors detected in the initial screening was done. this led to the identification of twenty σ <dig> gene sequences, thirteen on chromosome  <dig>  seven on chromosome  <dig>  and none on chromosome  <dig> . all genomic regions harbouring σ <dig> coding sequences  were analysed by the testcode programme, to identify their corresponding orf. in the case of the presence of multiple initiation codons, the orf showing the longest cds was selected. all the defined σ <dig> gene sequences and their position on the bcen-j <dig> genome are listed in table  <dig>  given the genome size of bcen-j <dig> , an average of  <dig>  σ <dig> gene sequences per mb was computed. this number of sigma genes is slightly lower than the number reported in p. aeruginosa  for which an average of  <dig>  σ <dig> genes per mb was calculated. it is also lower than the one of the genome of streptomyces coelicolor strain a <dig>  which has a similar genome size. however, s. coelicolor has a very distinct morphology  and ecology. this simplistic analysis suggests that bacteria like the bcc and p. aeruginosa, which are sharing several habitats, have similar number of σ <dig> gene sequences. however, the composition of these families was found to be quite different .

tblastn searches of bce-j <dig> σ factors were performed on fully sequenced burkholderia genomes. in accordance with phylogenetic inferences shown in fig.  <dig> and  <dig>  tblastn were considered to reveal homologs or orthologs of a same σ <dig> lineage when showing identity values above 50% and similarity higher than 63%, and when being part of a phylogenetic cluster supported by high bootstrap values. • p. aeruginosa orbs homologs, named pvds, showed 38% identity and 56% similarity with bcen-j <dig> homolog. sequences were retrieved from  <cit> . genomes of the following strains were analysed: b. cenocepacia, strains j <dig>  au <dig>  hi <dig>  pc <dig> ; b. vietnamiensis, g4; burkholderia sp.,  <dig> ; b. ambifaria, ammd, b. dolosa, au0158; b. xenovorans, lb400; b. mallei, atcc <dig>   <dig>  gb <dig> horse  <dig>  savp1; b. pseudomallei, 1710a, 1710b, s <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  k96243; b. thailendensis, e264; p. aeruginosa, pao <dig>  pa <dig>  * indicates an orf different from the one of the annotated genome.  distribution limited to burkholderia genomes, see fig.  <dig> 

classification of σ <dig> gene sequences of bcen-j <dig> into functional categories
translated amino acid  sequences from bcen-j <dig> σ <dig> coding sequences were positioned among the main eubacterial σ <dig> lineages, using a decisional σ <dig> neighbor-joining  phylogenetic tree limited to key sequences . this phylogenetic tree divides the σ <dig> gene family into four groups :  one grouping the primary  and alternative primary actinomycetal factors,  one grouping the stationary phase factors ,  one the heat shock , flagellin , and cellular differentiation  factors, and  one grouping factors involved in extracytoplasmic functions . all these groups are supported by high bootstrap values. this phylogenetic tree allowed to allocate  <dig> of the bcen-j <dig> σ <dig> gene sequences into the ecf . the ecf group is often the most important in number, and is the main group involved in bacterial responses toward changing environmental conditions. ecf sequences represent 66% of the σ <dig> gene sequences of the bcen-j <dig> genome, a number which is lower than the one observed in p. aeruginosa   <cit> . two deduced aa sequences, ecfa <dig> and ecfa <dig>  are 100% identical in bcen-j <dig>  and their respective genes are positioned on two identical dna strands of  <dig> kb that are diametrically opposed on chromosome  <dig> . for the remaining  <dig> factors, three were allocated to group  <dig> , one to group  <dig> , and two to group  <dig> .

bcen-j <dig> deduced σ <dig> factors conserved domains were revealed by cdd analyses . four conserved domains  were described  <cit>  among the σ <dig> family, with region  <dig> being sub-divided into r1_ <dig> and r1_ <dig>  bcen-j <dig> sige, i and j contain all four regions. regions  <dig> and  <dig> were identified in bcen-j <dig> deduced sigl, sigm and sigk sequences but only a full region  <dig> was found in sigm and sigk. sub region 1_ <dig> was detected in sigk. only regions  <dig> and  <dig> were detected among the ecf factors.

molecular phylogeny of bcen-j <dig> primary, stationary, and stress response/cellular differentiation/flagellin synthesis σ <dig> gene sequences
the nj tree of fig.  <dig> could not be used to asses accurately the phylogenetic relationships among each of the main σ <dig> phylogenetic groups. the phylogenetic resolution of the σ <dig> family appeared to be more robustly determined by splitting the dataset into two subsets corresponding to ecf and non-ecf  deduced σ <dig> aa sequences.

reliable phylogenetic positioning of bcen-j <dig> deduced σ <dig> factors was performed by first extracting all aa sequences in the databases showing significant similarities with these factors. these sequences were then added to the multiple alignment obtained by lavire et al.  <cit> , and a nj phylogenetic tree was inferred . names of lineages used in lavire et al.  <cit>  were kept. the nj tree of non-ecf aa sequences is divided into three major clusters of paralogs, matching the non-ecf categories described in the above section . all these paralogous σ <dig> sequences appear to have emerged early in the evolution of the eubacteria. the sige/rpod , sigm/flia and sigl/rpoh homologs  were detected among at least the α-, β-, and γ-proteobacteria, suggesting an emergence prior to the diversification of these bacterial groups. however, the group  <dig> factors  were found restricted to β-proteobacteria and γ-proteobacteria.

- the primary and alternative primary σ <dig> factors phylogenetic radiation 
in the nj tree of non-ecf σ <dig> factors , the group of primary and alternative primary factors was found divided into  <dig> distinct and significant lineages: c, d and e corresponding to the essential eubacterial primary factors, g and h being representatives of the alternative primary factors lineages of the actinobacteria, and i and j being two novel lineages. bcen-j <dig> sige and its burkholderia orthologs are found to be part of cluster e, the rpod lineage of essential sigma factors of the proteobacteria, and were thus renamed rpod. a b. dolosa strain au <dig> rpod-like sequence appeared distantly related to other burkholderia deduced rpod but a closer look at its gene structure showed a frameshift probably due to a sequencing mistake. an additional copy of the rpod gene was detected in the b. xenovorans genome . this copy shows a deduced aa sequence significantly different from the ones of the sige/rpod burkholderia orthologs, suggesting either acquisition by an horizontal transfer event or an ancient duplication event prior to the diversification of the β-proteobacteria.

bcen-j <dig> sigi and sigj deduced sequences and their orthologs revealed two novel lineages of group  <dig> factors which are restricted to the burkholderia genomes , and were thus termed alternative burkholderia primary factors. the sigj coding sequence was not detected in b. xenovorans and b. cenocepacia pc <dig> genomes . however, sigj dna probings of bcc genomic dna blots showed a broad distribution among the bcc  . sigi was not detected in the genomes of the bcc strain  <dig>  of b. xenovorans, and of b. pseudomallei and its closely related genomes . nevertheless, bcc dna blot analyses using sigi dna probes showed this gene largely distributed in the bcc . in b. xenovorans lb <dig> genome, sigi and sigj were not detected but another lineage of alternative burkholderia primary factors was found. the presence of coding sequences of such factors can thus be considered a common feature of burkholderia genomes. alternative primary factors were never detected in p. aeruginosa. in fact, this is the first report demonstrating the presence of alternative primary factors among bacteria outside the actinomycetes. the function of these alternative primary factors is unknown but they possess all the domains found among the rpod factors i. e. - <dig> and - <dig> promoter recognition domains, rna polymerase binding domains, etc . these factors could be replacing the primary one under growth conditions inhibiting its expression or functioning .

32p-random labelling of dna probes were done as described in the methods section. see table  <dig> for position of the pcr products used for the synthesis of dna probes. + : positive hybridization signal, - : no hybridization signal . * : hydridization signals varied according to the sigi dna probe used. : these positive signals were only obtained with the bvi-sigi probe.

- the stationary phase σ <dig> factors phylogenetic radiation 
the group  <dig> phylogenetic radiation is divided into two clusters  which match the diversification of the proteobacteria into the β and γ subgroups . bcen-j <dig> sigk deduced amino acids sequence is clustered with the β-proteobacteria rpos deduced sequences . in b. cepacia and b. pseudomallei, rpos was shown to be implicated in oxidative stress response, to be induced by heat shock treatments, and upon carbon starvation  <cit> . no rpos-like coding sequence was detected in any α-proteobacterial or other eubacterial genomes. among the actinomycetes, the stationary phase factors are known to be part of a fifth group of sigma factors which was not considered in this study i.e. the lineage of actinomycetal stress response and stationary phase factors   <cit> . this group is not closely related to group  <dig>  misleading automatic annotations of several rpos gene sequences were observed in borrelia, bacteroides, blastopirellula, rhodopirellula, moorella or aquifex genome; their deduced factors did not group in the rpos cluster . to clarify this situation, we suggest the use of the name rpos only for sequences of the group  <dig> σ <dig> factors from the β- and γ-proteobacteria. the restricted distribution of rpos gene sequences and their close phylogenetic proximity with group  <dig> sequences  suggest a likely emergence of rpos from an ancestral group  <dig> sequence. a duplication of the highly conserved eubacterial rpod gene probably led to this paralogous group. alternative primary factors described in the above section might have evolved from similar but more recent duplication events.

the emergence of rpos can be considered a key event in the evolution of the eubacteria. molecular phylogenies of rpod , and flia-like and rpoh-like sequences   suggest an early diversification of the α-proteobacterial sequences from those of the β- and γ-proteobacterial sequences. this can also be inferred from other datasets e.g. rrs and concatenation of essential proteins  <cit> . the emergence of rpos matches the separation of the α-proteobacteria  from the β- and γ-proteobacteria .

- the stress response/cellular differentiation/flagellin synthesis σ <dig> factors phylogenetic radiation 
group  <dig> is polyphyletic and divided into two groups, one corresponding to flia-like sequences, and one corresponding to rpoh-like ones . bcen-j <dig> sigm deduced aa sequence belongs to the flia subgroup, whereas bcen-j <dig> sigl deduced aa sequence groups with the rpoh-like sequences . a sigm  homolog was confirmed to be involved in motility among the burkholderia  <cit> .

molecular phylogeny of bcen-j <dig> extracytoplasmic functions σ <dig> gene sequences 
phylogenetic relationships among the ecf cluster are presented in fig.  <dig>  all database sequences closely related to bcen-j <dig> putative ecf were considered in this analysis. a first round of phylogenetic analysis allowed the identification of all database factors related to bcen-j <dig> ecfs. a second round of analyses was then performed by limiting the dataset to a set of selected sequences representative of the main phylogenetic trends observed. fig.  <dig> shows the best nj tree obtained. its structure is not supported by high bootstrap values but all sub-groups of ecfs are supported by high ones. ecfa, ecfc and ecfi deduced aa sequences are the only bcen-j <dig> ecf factors having homologs in the p. aeruginosa genomes.

- ecfa: evidence of an et <dig> clone-specific duplication event
ecfa-like deduced sequences are found in several proteobacterial genomes but could not be detected in the ones of α-proteobacteria . surprisingly, b. vietnamiensis and burkholderia sp.  <dig> deduced ecfa sequences were found to group apart from other ecfa-like sequences belonging to the burkholderia ; making these sequences closer relatives of a ralstonia homologous sequence. ecfa encodes a factor highly similar to the well-characterized algu factor of p. aeruginosa which is involved in alginate biosynthesis  <cit> . however, the b. cepacia homolog of ecfa was recently shown not to be involved in exopolysaccharide biosynthesis and onion pathogenicity. it was found involved in the adaptation to heat stress and phosphate starvation  <cit> . interestingly, the ecfa gene sequence was found in two copies in the bcen-j <dig> genome. these two copies are harboured by identical  <dig> kb dna fragments delimited, on one hand, by an is element.

to trace back the ecfa duplication event in b. cenocepacia, a pcr strategy was built. pcr primers were defined for each hand of the duplicated  <dig> kb regions containing the ecfa copies . pcr products from the b and c primers , targeting the duplicated region containing the ecfa <dig> allele, were obtained for all but the lmg  <dig> strain of the et <dig> clonal complex; a strain confirmed to be a member of the et <dig> clone by pcr screening of the bcesm and cbla loci . pcr products amplified with the a and b primers , targeting the end of the dna region affected by the ecfa duplication and its linked chromosomal inversion, were obtained for this latter et <dig> strain and the non-et <dig> b. cenocepacia isolates. b. cenocepacia phdc strains  and b. cenocepacia pc <dig> genomes harboured only the ecfa <dig> allele. the et <dig> lmg  <dig> strain, which was not found to harbour the  <dig> kb ecfa-duplicated region, could have either reverted to its previous genetic organization or could be a more ancestral representative of the et <dig> clonal complex. these data suggest that duplication of the ecfa  <dig> kb locus could have contributed to the radiation of the et <dig> complex.

* position on b. vietnamiensis g <dig> genome

bcen-j <dig> chromosome  <dig>  was compared to chromosome  <dig> of burkholderia sp.  <dig> using the promer tool according to  <cit> . this tool provides large scale dna sequence analysis. orfs were automatically detected and similar ones were plotted on fig. 6b. this analysis detected two inversion events on these chromosomes. to determine the role of ecfa- <dig> kb region in these duplication events, the chromosome  <dig> region was inverted manually between the two  <dig> kb duplications and compared with burkholderia sp.  <dig> chromosome  <dig> . in this way, only the first inversion is detected, indicating that the  <dig> kb duplication was implicated in the large scale inversion of bcen-j <dig> chromosome  <dig>  one border of the  <dig> kb duplication was found to harbor an insertion sequence  named isbcen <dig> according to the is database  <cit> . this is could have played a role in the duplication event that led to the inversion of an important part of chromosome  <dig> of et <dig> strains. this insertion sequence is found  in seven copies on chromosome  <dig>  two copies on chromosome  <dig>  and  <dig> copies on chromosome  <dig>  the orf encoding the transposase of this is was identified with orf finder and confirmed by gc skew analysis. is <dig> from the is <dig> family  was found to be the closest phyletic neighbour of this is.

in several species such as p. aeruginosa, salmonella typhi or bordetella pertussis, genome rearrangements were found associated with infectious outbreaks  <cit> . hughes et al.  <cit>  suggested that rearranged genomes could allow to overcome the immune system of the host. the ecfa  <dig> kb locus could thus have contributed to the emergence of the hyper-virulent et <dig> infra-specific clonal complex by driving a large scale inversion of chromosome  <dig> 

- ecfb: involvement in temperature-dependent processes
this ecf lineage has a broad distribution . related genes could be found in the α and γ-proteobacteria. ecfb dna probings of bcc genomic dna blots confirmed its large distribution in the bcc . the deduced ecfb protein is phylogenetically closely related to prti which is involved in a temperature dependent regulation of certain proteases  <cit> . however, no gene at the proximity of ecfb was found to encode a protease in bcen-j <dig> and other burkholderia genomes. such a situation was also observed for the prti-like locus of the p. putida genome  <cit> . ecfb could thus be involved in temperature dependent regulatory processes but seems to have been recruited for the regulation of other protein families than proteases.

- ecfc and ecfi: ecf gene sequences involved in iron-uptake
the ecf nj tree  shows bcen-j <dig> deduced ecfi sigma factor to group with the pvds factor from pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the ecfc deduced factor to group with feci-like factors. ecfi was previously shown to be involved in siderophore  biosynthesis  <cit>  . here, it is found to have a broad distribution . feci was shown to be involved in the regulation of iron dicitrate uptake in e. coli  <cit> . in other bacterial species, the fecira system can regulate iron uptake by other siderophores than citrate  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis of ecfc/feci homologs suggests an emergence of this particular sub-group after the diversification of the α-proteobacteria  from the other proteobacteria. interestingly, feci-like factors represented 26% of p. aeruginosa deduced ecf factors, and 68% of those of p. putida  <cit> . among p. aeruginosa and p. putida, these systems were all physically linked to genes involved in the synthesis of outer membrane siderophore receptor proteins. the high numbers of feci paralogs in these two pseudomonads were considered indicative of a shared ability at colonizing certain niches that require distinct iron uptake systems or particular interactions with siderophores  <cit> . in the case of the bcc, a single feci-like factor was detected. the ecfc gene, encoding this factor, was found physically linked to fecr- and feca-like gene sequences. feci can interact with fecr to activate the fecabcde operon involved in the transport of extracellular fe-citrate complexes to the cytoplasm. fecr interaction is modulated by feca which will activate the fecir interactions after perception of fe-citrate complexes. tblastn searches using fecr were performed on selected bcc genomes to ensure that no fecira-like system was missed during our analyses. these searches did not detect any other fecira system in bcen-j <dig>  b. vietnamiensis, b. dolosa, and b. ambifaria genomes. other tblastn searches using hemo, cira, has, hxuc, and p. aeruginosa sigx, fiui, pigd, and pupi-homologs were performed to complete this analysis. none of these blast searches revealed novel coding sequences involved in haem- or iron-uptake  <cit>  in bcen-j <dig> 

interestingly, b. cenocepacia was recently shown able to get its iron from ferritin by proteolytic degradation of this iron-binding protein. b. cenocepacia is apparently the only known pathogenic bacteria able to use ferritin as an iron source  <cit> . the iron uptake strategies selected by p. aeruginosa and the bcc are thus quite different; with p. aeruginosa showing a greater versatility in ecf regulated processes.

- ecfd, ecfe, ecfg, ecfh, ecfl and ecfm loci: unknown physiological implications
the physiological processes involving these regulatory factors remain unknown. however, their distribution and evolutionary history reveal several observations suggesting that they play significant roles.

ecfd is grouping with ecf factors deduced from genomes of other proteobacterial groups  but not α-proteobacterial ones. ecfd dna probings of bcc genomic dna blots showed a large distribution in the bcc . ecfe is not grouping with ecf factors from other proteobacteria but is closely related to σ factors found among solibacter usitatus and cytophaga hutchinsonii. ecfe dna probings gave positive hybridization signals on b. cepacia, b. cenocepacia, b. stabilis, b. dolosa and b. pyrrocinia genomic dna blots . however, restricted genomic dna from all strains of b. multivorans and b. vietnamiensis, tested in this study, did not yield positive hybridization signals with the ecfe probe. phage dna might have played a role in the loss of ecfe in these bacterial species . surprisingly, the ecfe deduced aa sequence of b. dolosa au <dig> was found distantly related to other homologs of the bcc. ecfg is significantly grouping with σ factors deduced from other β- and α-proteobacterial genomes but not with γ-proteobacterial ones. in this case, a deletion of ecfg-like sequences probably occurred early in the evolution of the γ-proteobacteria. concerning the deduced aa sequences of ecfk and ecfh coding regions, homologs could be detected in genomes of the three main proteobacterial groups . bcen-j <dig> ecfh deduced homologs were mainly found in genomes of α-proteobacteria but a sequence was also detected among one γ-proteobacterial genome, the one of pseudomonas fluorescens. ecfh was not detected in the b. vietnamiensis g <dig> and b. ambifaria ammd genomes . ecfk homologs were found in other burkholderia genomes and in the one of a species of polaromonas, which is also part of the β-proteobacteria. ecfk was not detected in the b. vietnamiensis g <dig> and b. ambifaria ammd genomes . ecfl is clustered with ecf without any known function but encoding a tpr  motif involved in protein-protein interactions. this motif is not found in ecfl and its related burkholderia ecf factors. in fact, deduced ecfl-like sequences retrieved from b. ambifaria ammd, b. cenocepacia pc <dig> and b. pseudomallei  <dig> genomes are misleadingly annotated with a tpr repeat motif in the databases. ecfl coding gene sequences are found in the genomes of the actinobacteria and proteobacteria with the exception of the α-proteobacterial ones. ecfm deduced orthologs were found among most proteobacterial sub-groups with the exception of b. pseudomallei and closely related species.

- ecff and ecfj: evidence of burkholderia-specific lineages
ecff and ecfj are distinct deduced σ <dig> factors which do not group on the nj tree  with any of the previously described ecf sigma factors available in the databases. they can thus be considered burkholderia-specific. however, ecfj was not detected in the genome of b. xenovorans lb <dig>  the processes making use of these ecf factors remain unknown.

genomic rearrangements of σ <dig> genetic loci among bcc sequenced genomes
inside the bcc, syntheny analyses of the σ <dig> genetic loci were performed using act  <cit> . some of these results are shown in fig.  <dig>  sige, sigl, sigm, sigk, ecfa, ecfb, ecfd, ecff, ecfj, ecfl and ecfm genetic loci were conserved over at least  <dig> kb  among the tested bcc genomes. ecfb is located  <dig>  kb upstream ecfm. sigi, sigj, ecfc, ecff, ecfg, ecfh, ecfi, and ecfk loci were affected by various genomic rearrangements. ecfa, ecfb and ecff are physically linked to anti-sigma gene sequences. three major categories of genomic rearrangementswere defined, one leading to a loss of a sigma gene through unknown processes, one leading to a loss of a sigma gene through integration of phage dna, and one leading to a reorganization of the genetic environment surrounding the sigma gene.

- loss of σ <dig> gene sequences in the bcc: cases of ecfc, ecfg, ecfh, ecfk, sigi, and sigj loci
in this category, in one instance, a very precise deletion of a sigma gene and its respective anti-sigma was observed. this situation was observed for ecfg and its anti-sigma in the b. vietnamiensis g <dig> genome. however, in most instances, the loss of a sigma gene was concomitant to the loss of important pieces of dna. sigi and sigj are, in fact, found deleted in respectively burkholderia sp.  <dig>  and b. cenocepacia pc <dig>  and the extension of the deleted regions were respectively of  <dig> and  <dig> kb. loss of ecfh in b. vietnamiensis g <dig> and b. dolosa au <dig> genomes were also associated with the deletion of a dna region . in the case of the ecfk locus, which is found at the proximity of a pilus synthesis cluster and genes involved in the synthesis of an alkylhydroperoxidase , its deletion involved a loss of about  <dig> kb in the genomes of b. vietnamiensis g <dig> and b. ambifaria ammd. interestingly, the configuration of these latter deletions were identical in these two genomes, suggesting that it had either occurred prior to the separation of these bacteria into two distinct species or involved similar processes. ecfc deletion event was observed among several genomes but the extent of the deletion events was variable. nevertheless, one border was always conserved. ecfc  is deleted in b. vietnamiensis g <dig>  b. ambifaria ammd and b. dolosa au <dig> genomes . part of the deletion concerned genes involved in iron-uptake. these genomic rearrangements of the ecfc genetic cluster could explain the differences observed between b. cepacia and b. vietnamiensis in response to iron starvation. b. vietnamiensis was only found to produce ornibactin under iron starvation while b. cepacia clinical isolates could also produce pyochelin and cepabactin  <cit> . among the b. ambifaria and b. dolosa ecfc loci,  <dig> to  <dig> orfs, over the eleven likely involved in iron-uptake in bcen-j <dig>  were found conserved. one of these was found encoding a citrate symporter involved in the transport of fe-citrate complexes. to our knowledge, it is not yet known if b. ambifaria and b. dolosa ecfc loci are functional.

- loss of ecfe in b. vietnamiensis: involvement of phage dna
concerning this second category, syntheny analysis showed the bcen-j <dig> ecfe region to have been modified by the integration of phage dna in b. vietnamiensis strain g <dig>  in this genome, ecfe and an overall  <dig> kb region are replaced by phage dna. all genes upstream the trna gene of the ecfe region are conserved. the loss of ecfe in b. vietnamiensis was confirmed by dna blot analyses . all restricted genomic dna of the b. vietnamiensis strains tested did not show any dna hybridization with an ecfe probe. similarly, no positive hybrization signal could be obtained on b. multivorans dna blots , while positive signals were obtained for the other bcc species. it is not known if the integration of phage dna was involved in the deletion of ecfe among the b. vietnamiensis and b. multivorans strains analysed by dna probings. however, we consider that this is highly probable.

- reorganized σ <dig> genetic loci in the bcc: cases of ecfi and ecfe loci
concerning this third category, two cases were observed. one concerned the ecfi  region, and the other one the ecfe region. regarding ecfi and its related genetic cluster, the ornibactin biosynthesis cluster, genes upstream ecfi are found deleted in b. vietnamiensis g <dig>  b. cenocepacia hi <dig> and au <dig> genomes, and translocated elsewhere in the burkholderia sp.  <dig> genome. genes involved in fimbrial synthesis, and the synthesis of a two component system were partly affected by these rearrangements . similarly, the ecfe region and three of its neighboring genes proximal to a trna gene sequence in b. cenocepacia j <dig> chromosome  <dig> were translocated into a distinct region of the genome of burkholderia sp.  <dig>  while all other genes were kept in place .

CONCLUSIONS
this paper was dedicated to the analysis of the σ <dig> gene family, its architecture and plasticity, through an analysis of about  <dig> genome sequences of the eubacterial burkholderia genus. emphasis was made on a bacterial group of this genus which is named the "burkholderia cepacia complex" or bcc. several epidemic clones have been described in the bcc, including bacteria responsible of the "cepacia syndrome", a dramatic necrotizing pneumonia. the great versatility of these bcc species could be linked to an important diversity in regulatory processes including those of the σ <dig> gene family. the σ <dig> gene family is widely distributed among the eubacteria, and probably emerged early in bacterial evolution. duplication events led to the emergence of several bcc σ <dig> paralogs which were found limited to certain bacterial groups like the proteobacteria, burkholderia, the cepacia complex, and particular bcc species or strains. this gene family was found to be under strong selective pressures that could lead to acquisition/deletion , and duplication events  modifying its architecture. these changes are likely to be key events in bcc evolution, generating novel gene expression profiles that could be more suited for the colonization of particular biotopes including the respiratory tract of cf patients. a key conclusion was that the comparative analysis of the σ <dig> gene architecture of bcc species and of pseudomonas aeruginosa, a species found in similar habitats including cf lungs, revealed distinct evolutionary strategy, with the bcc having selected several alternative primary factors, something not recorded among p. aeruginosa and only reported to occur among the actinobacteria. only three ecf paralogs  were found in common between the bcc and p. aeruginosa. the next step in these studies will be to investigate the impact of gains and losses of σ <dig> determinants in the ecology of the bcc and the colonization of the cf lungs.
