BACKGROUND
whole-system approaches employing data derived from microarray and high-throughput sequencing technologies require development of new methods for inferring novel knowledge discovery in large-scale data sets. the generation of spatially or temporally interactive transcriptome profiles in a multicellular organism is still challenging and expensive. therefore methods that can analyze already existing data are urgently needed.

crop varieties for sustainable biomass production and adaptation to multiple environmental stresses are needed to meet climatic and environmental challenges, and fulfil the world's bioenergy needs. development of such varieties requires in-depth knowledge of the regulators that play key roles in abiotic stress tolerance and adaptive growth. understanding the underpinning regulatory mechanisms would enable development of viable solutions to modify plants with augmented stress tolerance and allow sustainable production on marginal lands. traditional experimental approaches that use candidate gene approaches suffer from biased subjective selection of genes' sets. thus, often these genes' modifications have little or no impact on the targeted trait and/or in many cases have severe pleitropic effects compromising their commercial deployment. for example, over-expression of dreb1a, and adr <dig> results in severely stunted growth  <cit>  and the expression of atnhx <dig> negatively impacts many cellular processes including protein transport and modification  <cit> . now it is becoming increasingly clear that only systems-based approaches providing thorough knowledge of the intricate genetic networks can provide solutions to these problems and lead to successful translation of biological knowledge into downstream commercial applications  <cit> . although our knowledge is incomplete, it has been shown that gene expression is often regulated in a combinatorial manner  <cit>  indicative of the underlying genetic network interactions. development of methods that can capture these synergistic regulations will provide new insights into the regulatory mechanisms underpinning many biological processes.

canonical correlation analysis  is a common means to simultaneously analyze the relationships between two sets of variables. however, when applied on large-scale microarray data sets, where the number of genes  greatly exceeds the number of samples, cca has two major shortcomings:  it causes computational problems and inaccurate estimates of parameters;  it leads to linear combinations of entire sets of available variables, which may lack biological plausibility and interpretability. to overcome these problems, sparse canonical correlation analysis  was recently proposed  <cit> . scca, an extension of cca, can find the maximally correlated relationship between two sets of variables by determining the linear combinations of variables from each set. scca provides sparse loadings in the linear combinations and thus results in smaller groups of variables, which can aid the biological interpretability. to further reduce the bias in model selection and number of selected variables, adaptive scca  has been recently proposed  <cit> . ascca outperforms scca by selecting the correct subset of variables for better discovery of the most plausible model. in addition, ascca produces fewer noise variables than scca. in this paper, we developed a package, tf-finder that takes advantage of ascca to identify tfs involved in a process of interest. as a test case we used tf-finder to identify tfs involved in stress tolerance and adaptive growth. we demonstrated that tf-finder produced interpretable and biologically meaningful data.

we also compared tf-finder with a closely related method, intersection of coexpression   <cit> , which evaluates a gene from a candidate pool based on how significantly this gene is coexpressed with the number of genes in a positive gene set. we implemented ice in such a way that the expression data of all tfs were used for identifying novel tfs that are assumed to be involved in the same biological process as these positive tfs that are used as positive gene set. the comparison concluded that tf-finder outperforms ice in finding novel positive tfs. the novel positive tfs in this study are defined as the newly identified genes that do not belong to the positive tf used as guide genes but are evidenced to be positive genes by present knowledge for involvement in the same biological process.

RESULTS
we used tf-finder to identify candidate regulatory genes that are involved in salt and drought stress tolerance as well as the adaptive growth under these conditions.

identification of salt stress response and tolerance regulators
we applied ascca to  <dig> microarray data sets collected from seven salt stress microarray experiments. the input files contain the expression profiles of  <dig> positive target genes  that are known to be involved in salt response and tolerance,  <dig> arabidopsis tfs present in affymetrix ath <dig> array, and  <dig> tfs   known to be involved in salt response and tolerance. the cluster analysis of the  <dig> target genes resulted in about  <dig> clusters that were used to hook tfs in a recursive manner. all tfs identified through this procedure were pooled for frequency calculation. the top  <dig> genes with highest occurrence frequencies are shown in additional file  <dig>  among these genes,  <dig> tfs were clearly supported by existing evidence to be involved in salt response and tolerance . for example, wrky <dig>  azf <dig>  and natac <dig> were among the list of  <dig> tfs used as guide genes . although the other  <dig> were all novel, indirect evidence suggests that they are likely involved in this stress response. for instance, czf <dig>  also known as szf <dig>  is the most homologous gene to szf <dig>  and it regulates salt stress responses in arabidopsis  <cit> . zat <dig> is the most homologous gene to stz  in arabidopsis. rhl <dig>  is involved in hyperosmotic salinity response  <cit> . anac <dig> has been found to bind to the early responsive to dehydration  stress gene promoter, and over-expression of this gene, together with anac <dig> and anac <dig>  causes the expression of several stress-inducible genes that enhance drought tolerance  <cit> . over-expression of szf <dig>  in transgenic plants caused reduced induction of salt responsive genes and increased tolerance to salt  <cit> . stz  was found to increase salt tolerance of calcineurin mutants of wild-type yeast, which appears to be partially dependent on ena1/pmr <dig>  a p-type atpase required for li+ and na+ efflux. ataf <dig> is responsive to wounding and aba. dreb2a and dreb2b  are induced upon dehydration and high salinity  <cit> . atmyc <dig> is a positive regulator of aba signalling. mybr <dig> is aba-regulated and participates in mediating aba effects  <cit> . cbf <dig> functions as a transcriptional activator that binds to the c-repeat/dre dna regulatory element in response to low temperature and water deficit  <cit> . although cbf <dig> mainly responds to chilling, the expression of cbf <dig> also confers salt stress tolerance  <cit> . bzip <dig>  an er-resident tf, serves as a sensor/transducer in arabidopsis to mediate er stress responses  <cit> .

identification of adaptive growth regulators under salt condition
we also used tf-finder to identify tfs controlling growth under the same stress condition. we used the expression profiles of  <dig> positive target genes that are involved in growth,  <dig> positive tfs , and  <dig> tfs.  <dig> positive tfs include at5g02470-dpa, at4g16110-arr <dig>  at3g13960-grf <dig>  at5g53660-grf <dig>  at2g16720-myb <dig>  at3g49690-myb <dig>  at5g20730-nph <dig>  at1g13260-rav <dig>  at2g33880-hb <dig>  and at1g32640-myc <dig>  the resulting top  <dig> candidate tfs are shown in additional file  <dig>  among these genes,  <dig> tfs have regulatory functions in growth. three nac domain-containing tfs: at3g61910-anac <dig>  at1g60280-anac <dig>  and at5g04400-anac <dig>  have been shown to be involved in the differentiation and expansion of petals, stamen, and roots  <cit> . three closely related basic helix-loop-helix  proteins, at5g53210-spch, at3g06120-mute and at_fama, have been identified as positive regulators that direct three consecutive cell-fate decisions during stomatal development  <cit> . at3g13960-atgrf <dig> is one of the nine members of grf gene family that contain nuclear targeting domain, and is involved in root development  <cit> . at2g13570-nf-yb <dig> encoding leafy cotyledon1-like is a regulator essential for embryo development  <cit> . knat <dig> is expressed in roots and is required for proper lateral root formation <cit> . at4g27330-spl plays a central role in patterning of both the proximal-distal and the adaxial-abaxial axes in the ovule and is generally involved in cell differentiation  <cit> . at2g35670-fis <dig> and at1g02580-mea are involved in seed development  <cit> . cal is floral homeotic gene encoding a mads domain protein homologous to ap <dig> promoting the flower to shoot transformation in ap <dig> mutants  <cit> . at3g15170-cuc <dig>  together with cuc <dig> and cuc <dig>  are responsible for shoot organ boundary and meristem formation throughout the different stages of arabidopsis life cycle  <cit> . nub encodes a protein with a single ch zinc-finger domain and is involved in the growing of later organs  <cit> . dot <dig> is involved in vein patterning, but dot5- <dig> mutants often have shorter roots, suggesting its functions in root development  <cit> . ino is involved in ovule development  <cit> . blh <dig> encoded a bel <dig> like protein, which was identified to play a role in shoot meristem  <cit>  and ovule development <cit> . b <dig> is differentially expressed in anther, and presumably involved in anther development and differentiation  <cit> . lbd <dig> encodes a protein that functions in defining the lateral organ boundaries  <cit> . at5g58080-arr <dig> encodes a type b response regulator that mediates cytokinins signaling transduction in arabidopsis  <cit> .

identification of adaptive growth regulators under drought condition
after showing tf-finder can be used to identify key regulators using data from salt stress experiments, we were interested in extending tf-finder performance testing to a different data set and biological process. we therefore used data from water stress experiments. the three input files contained the profiles of  <dig> genes involved in various growth processes ,  <dig> positive tfs , and all  <dig> tfs detected to be expressed in the water stress data set. the top  <dig> tfs are shown in additional file  <dig>  among which  <dig> tfs were previously implicated to be involved in regulation of growth, and one tf, at2g16720_myb <dig>  in these  <dig> genes is a re-discovered positive tf. to avoid spelling out their functions at length, we showed all pieces of evidence that support these genes are positive in table  <dig> 

identification of regulatory genes from water stress data using ascca
to test if tf-finder can identify growth regulators from water stress data, we used three files that contained the profiles of  <dig> target genes,  <dig> positive tfs   and all  <dig> tfs detected to be expressed in the water stress data set. the resulting top  <dig> genes were found to contain  <dig> novel tfs  that are supported by existing evidence to be involved in root growth under water stress condition. again we are not going to elaborate these genes' functions at length. all pieces of evidence that support these genes are positive were shown in table  <dig> 

discussion
we have developed and shown that the tf-finder package can be used to discover tfs involved in various biological processes. the discovery efficiency varies with both biological processes and genes used to guide the recognition process. to further evaluate the performance of tf-finder, we compared it to the ice algorithm  <cit>  in identification of tfs involved in namely four biologically processes:  salt tolerance,  growth under salt stress,  growth under water stress,  drought tolerance. the inputs for ice algorithm include the transcriptome profiles of all  <dig> tfs and one of the following positive tf sets:  <dig> tfs involved in salt tolerance,  <dig> tfs involved in root growth, and  <dig> tfs involved in water stress tolerance. the results of tfs identified through the two algorithms are shown in figure  <dig>  and are also listed in additional file 3

among the top  <dig> tfs discovered to be regulators of salt tolerance,  <dig> are common between the two methods. among these,  <dig> novel tfs were identified by both tf-finder and ice. among these  <dig> tfs,  <dig> were common. this seems to indicate similar efficiency of the two algorithms. however, the comparison between tf-finder and ice in identifying growth regulators operating during both salt and water stress suggests that tf-finder outperforms ice. of the top  <dig> tfs identified for controlling growth in salt stress, only  <dig> tfs are common between two methods.  <dig> and  <dig> novel tfs identified by tf-finder and ice respectively were implicated to be positive by the existing annotation with only  <dig> common. of the top  <dig> growth tfs from water stress data,  <dig> tfs found by two methods were common. similarly  <dig> and  <dig> novel tfs were identified by tf-finder and ice respectively, and only  <dig> tfs found by both methods were common. finally, the efficiency of two methods was compared to discover tfs involved in water stress. of the identified top  <dig> tfs, only  <dig> was common, indicating that despite that both are linear-based methods, tf-finder indeed can identify different tfs. in this case,  <dig> and  <dig> tfs were discovered by tf-finder and ice respectively, and the existing annotation suggests their involvement in response to water stress. this indicates a better performance of ice in identifying the genes involved in water stress response and tolerance.

the fact that the two methods can recognize different tfs is not surprising because they use different inputs and employ different mechanisms for identifying transcription regulators. namely, tf-finder hooks tfs using positive target genes. although both methods use positive tfs, tf-finder uses them as guide genes while ice as baits to recognize co-expressed genes. because by design tf-finder identifies a group of tfs controlling a group of targets, it tends to discover combinatorial nature of tfs in regulating a group of target genes. as it is well-known, the drought tolerance gene, proline dehydrogenase in arabidopsis  <cit> , and gsy <dig> in yeast  <cit> , as well as aba-induced gene expression  <cit>  are controlled by a small number of tfs in combinatorial manner. this is mediated by presence of the same stress-responsive cis-elements in the promoter sequences of many downstream stress-responsive genes and much less tfs that regulate these genes  <cit> . therefore we believe that there should be more genes subjected to combinatorial regulation during abiotic stress response and tolerance. in contrast to tf-finder, ice uses the pair-wise correlation. it thus tends to identify very tightly coupled or co-ordinated tfs by using those that are known to be involved in the same biological process. as the overall efficiency is concerned, in three out of four cases we examined tf-finder identified more tfs for which prior knowledge for involvement in the process of interest existed. the higher efficiency of tf-finder can be ascribed to the repeatedly tf recognition using clustered targets or the use of positive targets, or both of them.

integration of biological with mathematical models is critically important in discovering novel biological knowledge. however, the complexity of transcription regulation and the lack of data from well-designed experiments impede deriving a biological model using mathematic means. thus, employment of models  of known positive tfs to discover novel tfs is instrumental. we integrated these known tfs for novel tf discovery in a way that the enrichment of these tfs is indicative of a meaningful identification.

in this study, we tried only one set of input files for each case as above-mentioned, namely  salt tolerance;  growth under salt stress;  growth under water stress; and  drought tolerance, the number of novel tfs identified is remarkably high. in realty, an even larger number of multiple sets of input files can be formulated to amplify the power of the method. in this regard, the existing tf-finder package can be further improved to take multiple batches of input files, and run iteratively towards more exhaustive results. we believe that such an improvement can lead to the discovery of more novel tfs. in this study, we relied on the existing literature to annotate the identified gene lists and show the efficiency of the tf-finder in identifying positive tfs; however, we indeed noticed there were some highly ranked tfs that were not supported by existing evidence. due to this reason, we strongly believe there are more positive genes in the identified lists. in a real application, we encourage users to validate those highly ranked but functionally undefined genes by employing experimental means. by the way, we also tested the performance of scca  <cit>  on the same data sets with the same inputs. unfortunately it performed poorly in finding any transcription regulators, which further confirmed the previous conclusion that ascca provides better noise filtering and includes fewer uninformative variables than scca  <cit> .

with the availability of large volume of gene expression data, and more and more positive target and tf genes being validated by molecular biologists, tf-finder will no doubt have a wide variety of applications in the future. nevertheless, tf-finder is not useful when these resources are not available, for example, for a newly sequenced species. in addition, tf-finder may not be applicable to some biological processes in which the response of target genes to tf is slow or lagged.

CONCLUSIONS
the integration of existing knowledge base, cluster analysis, and ascca algorithm into a package  for finding novel tfs with pooled microarray-derived expression data is viable as evidenced by the significant number of discovered tfs. these tfs include previously identified to be involved in mediating abiotic stresses response, indicating that the method can successfully identify tfs involved in the process of interest. in addition, the results imply that combinatorial regulation is dominated in stress response and tolerance, and can be studied through the use of standard positive target  and regulatory genes . finally, the identification of so many regulatory genes in abiotic stresses is indicative of the involvement of a large complex gene networks. computational approaches as the one employed by tf-finder can allow insights into the backbone of these genetic networks.
