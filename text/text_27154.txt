BACKGROUND
plant responses to water deficit are complex and employ a number of molecular players that act in concert to protect cells and macromolecules as the availability of water drops below critical levels. in arabidopsis, rice, and other species many drought stress-inducible genes have been identified and classified into two major groups  <cit> . the first group encodes proteins thought to mediate stress tolerance, and includes late embryogenesis abundant proteins  and chaperones, water channels, transporters and biosynthetic enzymes for compatible solutes , and enzymes that detoxify reactive oxygen species . the second group encodes regulatory proteins related to signal transduction, such as abscisic acid  biosynthetic enzymes, phospholipid metabolic proteins, and transcription factors  including aba response elements , dehydration response element binding factors , ethylene response factors , as well as kinases and phosphatases. despite this knowledge base, the exact transcriptional mechanisms through which plants respond to water deficit are not completely understood and can vary significantly with respect to the species, the severity of the applied water stress, and the tissue being studied  <cit> .

phenotypic responses to water stress are most easily studied in aerial tissues and thus much of the research in this area has focused on stem and leaf tissues. roots, however, act as the primary sensory tissue for soil water availability  <cit>  and upon desiccation roots transmit information to aerial plant tissues via chemical signaling, primarily mediated by aba  <cit> . many aspects of root-to-shoot signaling remain controversial, but it is generally agreed that aba is synthesized in the roots and released into the xylem for transport to the shoots, where it induces physiological changes, such as stomatal closure, reduced transpiration, reduced growth, and altered ethylene biosynthesis  <cit> . other factors, such as cytokinins and small peptides, also originate from roots and may influence shoot responses to drying soils  <cit> . in the roots themselves, aba has been implicated in promoting drought-induced rhizogenesis, altering the developmental program for lateral roots and root hydraulic conductivity  <cit> .

transcriptional profiling studies of above-ground tissues responding to drought stress are far more prevalent than similar analyses of root tissues, with most performed on angiosperms  <cit> . however, microarrays have been utilized to profile gene expression in water-stressed roots from arabidopsis  <cit>  rice  <cit> , wheat  <cit> , corn  <cit> , bean  <cit> , sorghum  <cit> , and alfalfa  <cit> . these studies have identified genes that generally correspond well with those identified in aboveground tissues, including differential expression of genes involved in aba metabolism, signaling, stress tolerance , membrane transport , transporters and biosynthetic enzymes for compatible solutes , and enzymes for detoxifying ros.

species of the genus populus are the most well studied in terms of providing differential expression data on responses to water deficit in trees. recent studies have examined relationships of the transcriptome drought response as it relates to species differences  <cit> , growth regulation  <cit>  and genotype  <cit>  with one study evaluating both roots and leaves undergoing gradual water deficit and recovery  <cit> . taken together, these studies demonstrate contrasting transcriptional responses to drought with respect to species, genotypic, and diel effects. studies using populus also suggest that some drought tolerance mechanisms in roots have been conserved during the evolution of arboreal and herbaceous angiosperms, for example, the down-regulation of plasma membrane intrinsic protein  aquaporins  <cit> . despite the fact that conifers are an important silvicultural species, the effect of drought stress on transcriptome dynamics in conifer roots is still unclear. however, transcriptional responses in water-stressed pinus species are being investigated using a number of different genomic approaches  <cit> .

the purpose of this work was to compare global transcript profiles in well-watered , drought-stressed , and drought-recovered  roots from loblolly pine . towards this objective we developed a collection of public genomics tools, including a set of ca.  <dig>  sanger ests from mostly root tissues, an annotated 26496-feature cdna microarray for pine , and optimized protocols for microarray analysis of pine tissues  <cit> . after validating the ptgen <dig> microarray, we identified  <dig> genes that are differentially expressed in drought-stress roots from p. taeda and demonstrated that the transcript population in p. taeda roots returns to the pre-drought state within  <dig> hours of cessation of the drought treatment. weighted gene correlation network analysis   <cit>  identified key molecular players in the root drought response, many of which indicate similarities between mechanisms of drought tolerance in the roots of gymnosperms and angiosperms.

methods
experimental design
root samples were collected from 10-month old ramets,  or propagules having root structures essentially indistinguishable from those of pine seedlings. propagules representing four genotypes  obtained from full-sib crosses of elite commercial germplasm were grown and harvested by the forest biology research cooperative  as described  <cit> . established ramets were planted in plastic pots  containing 100% acid-washed fine sand, and maintained in natural daylight in a greenhouse in gainesville, fl.

the study employed a randomized complete block, split-plot design, with genotype as the whole-plot factor and watering treatment as the split-plot factor. the drought-stress treatment  withheld water until water potential in pre-dawn needles reached - <dig>  mpa and needles showed visible wilting, which occurred within seven treatment days. the drought-recovery treatment  withheld water until water potential in pre-dawn needles reached - <dig>  mpa, followed by watering to pot capacity on day seven and a subsequent drought recovery period of  <dig> hours. the control treatment  propagules were watered to pot capacity every other day during the treatment period and harvested at the same time as the ds samples. mean water potential in pre-dawn needles on the ww plants remained at - <dig>  mpa ±  <dig> . tissue samples from the dr and ww plants were harvested concomitantly.

gene expression was evaluated in loblolly roots following one of three treatments . four biological replicates were investigated, with each replicate comprised of rna pooled from three individuals . labeled targets from each cdna synthesis were hybridized twice to monitor technical variation. microarray experiments employed a reference design  <cit>  to identify genes that exhibited treatment-specific differences in loblolly pine roots; the reference sample was comprised of total rna from p. taeda roots, shoots and needles .

quantitative pcr 
primer pairs were validated using a dilution series of p. taeda genomic dna  . validation reactions were conducted in duplicate and contained  <dig> ul genomic dna,  <dig> ul primer pairs , and  <dig> ul iq™ sybr® green supermix . cycling parameters and selection of primers for validation have been published previously  <cit> . cdna was synthesized using invitrogen super script iii first strand synthesis system for rt-pcr . optimal cdna concentration was determined empirically using primer pairs made for the actin act <dig> gene. the same gene was used to normalize all qpcr data. reactions were performed in triplicate and averaged. samples with threshold cycle  values ≥  <dig> or those where the standard deviation across a triplicate was ≥  <dig>  were considered failed reactions and re-run.

the ptgen <dig> microarray
cdna sequences for the ptgen <dig> microarray were derived from thirty-six cdna libraries constructed primarily from loblolly root, stem and needle tissues  <cit> . a total of  <dig>   cdna clones were amplified using  <dig>  um pslfor <dig> primer  and  <dig>  um pslrev <dig> primer . reactions were incubated at 95°c for  <dig> min, followed by  <dig> amplification cycles  and then incubated at 72°c for  <dig> min. all reaction products were verified by agarose gel electrophoresis. cdnas were re-suspended in spotting buffer  and printed on corning ultragaps™ slides  using a biorobotics microgrid ii spotter . the  <dig> probes in print plate # <dig> were re-spotted as plate # <dig>  for use in monitoring technical variation across the array. microarrays were printed by the vanderbilt microarray shared resource facility.

loblolly pine 3' est sequences have been assembled previously  <cit> . contig consensus sequence or est singleton sequence was used as the blastx query to databases including ncbi nr, uniprotsprot, uniprottrembl, uniref, tair, medicago truncutula database , and oryza sativa . returned annotations with e-values >  <dig> × 10- <dig> were ignored. a master annotation file for identification of ptgen <dig> probes has been included . blast2go was used to identify gene ontology  terms associated with differentially expressed genes  <cit> .

cdna synthesis, labeling, and hybridization
root samples were pulverized under liquid nitrogen using a spex model  <dig> freezer mill . total rna was extracted from sample tissues using a modified protocol of chang et al.  <cit>  and rna samples were dnase-treated using the ambion turbo dna-free™ kit . rna concentration was determined spectrophotometrically and agarose gel electrophoresis was used to ascertain rna quality and integrity.

synthesis of amino-allyl and amino-hexyl modified cdna used the invitrogen superscript™ indirect cdna labeling system kit . reactions contained  <dig> ug of total rna,  <dig> ul anchored oligo <dig> primer,  <dig> ul random hexamer primer, and were carried out at 45°c for 12- <dig> hr. modified cdna was purified on s.n.a.p™ columns , precipitated, and re-suspended in warm 2x coupling buffer. cy- <dig> and cy- <dig>  were suspended in  <dig> ul dmso and coupled to the modified cdnas, as per the manufacturer's instructions. cy-labeled cdnas were purified using published methods  <cit> , after which synthesis and labeling efficiency were monitored spectrophotometrically.

microarray processing and hybridization protocols have been described previously  <cit> . slides were incubated in a hybchamber™  containing  <dig> ul  <dig> mm dtt in the humidity wells. the entire apparatus was wrapped in foil and incubated at 48°c for 14- <dig> hr.

data analysis
microarrays were scanned using a proscanarray™ confocal scanner  equipped with  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm lasers. raw fluorescence data were processed using imagene, ver.  <dig>  . signal means were determined without background correction  <cit> . data filtration, log <dig> transformation, normalization , and statistical analyses were completed using brb-array tools  <cit> . duplicated probes on the array were treated independently during normalization and statistical analyses. spot signals were filtered as described previously  <cit>  and unigenes with ≥ 50% missing data were not included in the analysis. when necessary, missing values were imputed using the knnimpute algorithm   <cit> . differentially expressed genes were identified from paired comparisons of the three treatment groups  using a random variance test  <cit> . the false discovery rate  was set to  <dig>  and a cut-off minimum of  <dig> -fold was used. differentially expressed genes identified in the ds vs. ww comparison were used to extract the normalized log <dig> mean ratio data identified from drought-recovery samples. weighted gene co-expression network analysis was performed as described previously  <cit>  using an r-script modified for this analysis and a network threshold cut off of  <dig>  . cytoscape ver.  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  and networkanalyzer ver.  <dig>   <cit>  were used to visualize the global gene network and calculate topology parameters. candidate network drivers were identified by ranking nodes based on their degree index and also by comparing to index values determined for closeness, radiality and eccentricity.

RESULTS
array performance validation
slide-to-slide reproducibility was verified via a hierarchical cluster analysis  of all datasets from each treatment group  which showed a clear separation of clustering of the drought-stressed  samples from well-watered  and drought-recovered  samples. feature-to-feature reproducibility was verified via a correlation analysis of filtered log <dig> ratios for  <dig> probes that are replicated on the array. the average r-values determined for each sample  ranged from r =  <dig>  to r =  <dig> , with an overall mean correlation of r =  <dig>  .

quantitative pcr  was used to validate treatment-specific expression patterns of  <dig> differentially expressed  genes, eight of which were the most highly up- or down-regulated transcripts identified in this study, and eight of which were moderately expressed transcription factors . all tested genes exhibited expression patterns that were consistent across the two platforms; however, ptgen <dig> underestimated the expression ratios in some cases by more than 10-fold when compared to qpcr values. signal compression of fold-change ratios is a common phenomenon that has been demonstrated with both oligo- and cdna microarrays  <cit>  and has been attributed to the presence of cross-hybridization signals  <cit> .

effect of drought stress on the p. taeda root transcriptome
comparison of drought-stressed and well-watered roots identified  <dig> de genes ,  <dig> of which returned annotation results from blastx and blast2go . in addition to gene ontology  terms associated with cellular and primary metabolic processes, the third most abundant go category for the  <dig> de genes that mapped to at least one term was stress response . three other relevant go categories were associated with responses to chemical, abiotic, and biotic stresses. table  <dig> lists the twenty-five drought stress-induced genes having the highest log <dig> expression ratios. genes thought to encode a class iv chitinase, late embryogenesis abundant proteins , and dehydrins were among the most highly up-regulated genes; while seven genes had no apparent homology to any known proteins. many pine genes with apparent homology to other genes associated previously with plant stress responses in angiosperms and gymnosperms were up-regulated in drought-stressed roots, including those thought to encode chitinase, dehydrin, defensin, chaperones/hsps, water-deficit-inducible lp <dig>  galactinol synthase , glutathione peroxidase, thaumatin, sucrose synthase , and β-glucosidase . in particular,  <dig> de genes thought to encode leas were detected and  <dig> were up-regulated following drought stress, as were all  <dig> genes identified as dehydrins. leas and dehydrins were also identified as hubs for the predicted global gene network . genes that may be involved in the production of osmolytes were also up-regulated. for example, all de genes identified as sus , gols , or raffinose synthase  were up-regulated after drought-stress, as were genes thought to be involved in proline biosynthesis, e.g. pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase .

gthe average clustering coefficient can be used to measure whether the network exhibits modular organization  <cit> .

up-regulated de genes thought to encode regulatory proteins included aba-responsive protein orthologs, aminocyclopropane  oxidases and synthase, and several transcription factors. transcription factors  showing increased transcript abundance after drought-stress included genes with notable homology to drebs  and erfs , as well as tfs in the wrky , dof , bzip , myb , and nac  families. several of these are thought to be central players in signal transduction pathways involved in both drought and abiotic stress responses  <cit> .

of the  <dig> de genes,  <dig> were down-regulated in ds roots. these included genes thought to encode auxin-responsive proteins, and components of cell wall and carbohydrate metabolism . numerous genes encoding putative aquaporins were down-regulated after drought stress, as were genes with homology to histones, dirigent-like proteins, cellulose synthases , expansins, pectate lyases, senescence-associated proteins, subtilisin-like and aspartic proteinases, and xyloglucan endotransglycosidases. for example, of the  <dig> de genes thought to encode aquaporins , most fell into the plasma membrane intrinsic protein  subgroup and all were down-regulated, except an arabidopsis pip2- <dig> ortholog . only seventeen tfs were down-regulated and only two of those, ap2/erf  and wrky , have been previously associated with regulatory roles in drought response.

weighted gene correlation network analysis   <cit>  was employed to mine the  <dig> de genes for candidate regulatory genes. as would be expected for a biological system, our data predict a gene co-expression network that displays scale-free topology with inherent modular features . eleven co-expression modules  were identified . evaluation of expression patterns from individual network modules revealed groups ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> genes that displayed coordinated changes in their transcript populations during drought stress and drought recovery . as shown in figure  <dig>  node degree distribution for the pine gene network approximates a power-law distribution, which is a characteristic of scale-free networks  <cit> . network statistics demonstrate that the pine root gene network has properties found in other biological networks . for example,  <dig> nodes were connected by  <dig>  edges, representing  <dig> % of the total edges possible in the network. sparsely connected nodes in highly clustered areas are a common characteristic of the hierarchal architecture seen in many biological networks  <cit> . the average clustering coefficient as well as values determined for the shortest path length and smallest network diameter, are characteristic of network compactness and indicative of "small-world" networks that display high clustering and short path lengths  <cit> .

node centrality indices were determined and the degree topological index was used to identify putative drivers of the root co-expression network   <cit> . other network centralities used to rank node significance  supported the ranking determined with the degree index . a gene of unknown function is the most highly connected node in the network while other ranked nodes are for genes that appear to encode a thioredoxin , a nucleotide binding site-leucine-rich repeat protein  , and an inositol transporter . nodes with possible regulatory significance included those for a 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase , a zeatin-o-glucosyltransferase , and an aba-responsive-like protein .

transcriptome responses in drought-recovered roots
comparison of dr roots with ww roots identified only  <dig> de genes , whereas comparison of ds roots with dr roots identified  <dig> de genes . more than 70% of the genes in this latter set were also identified in the comparison of ds and ww roots . the data shown in figure  <dig> is consistent with the observation that the transcript populations in drought recovered and well-watered roots are far more similar than either is to the transcript population in drought-stressed roots. taken together, these results suggest that the root transcriptome in p. taeda seedlings can return to its pre-drought state within  <dig> hours of recovery from the applied stress. moreover, the drought-recovered plants  no longer displayed the wilting phenotype seen in drought stressed plants and dr root tips had changed from the totally brown appearance seen in ds roots to having copious numbers of white root tips characteristic of control roots .

sixty-four of the  <dig> de genes identified in the drought recovered samples were up-regulated and  <dig> of these had little sequence homology to known genes . significant overlap between drought-recovered and drought-stressed expression patterns was seen as  <dig> of  <dig> genes identified in dr roots were also identified in ds roots . these included multiple genes encoding apparent leas, chitinases, and β-glucosidases . possible regulatory genes identified in the drought-recovered sample include a two-component histidine-kinase response regulator protein , an ethylene-responsive rna helicase , a gibberellin-regulated protein , and tfs belonging to the wrky  and zinc finger  classes. with the exception of the gibberellin-regulated protein, putative regulatory genes identified in drought-recovered roots were also found in the drought-stressed roots where they all demonstrated increased expression. few genes showed reduced expression after drought recovery and only one, an α-pinene synthase, showed expression reduced > 2-fold. among the genes down-regulated in drought-recovered roots were ones thought to encode pinene synthases, a pectate lyase, a xyloglucan endo-transglycosylase, and a β-glucosidase. only five de genes were identified exclusively in drought recovered roots. these appeared to encode a ribosomal protein , a xyloglucan endo-transglycosylase , a gibberellin-regulated protein , and two unknowns.

discussion
ptgen <dig> microarray
the loblolly pine microarray  that is described here contains  <dig>  features, including  <dig>  distinct cdnas, making it the largest publicly available microarray for any conifer species. ptgen <dig> can also be used for gene expression studies in species other than p. taeda. for example, it has been used to evaluate transcriptome dynamics in staged embryos from p. pinaster  <cit> , and to compare expression profiles from several closely related pine and conifer species . the data presented here demonstrate the utility of ptgen <dig> in the evaluation of transcriptome responses in loblolly pine and identifies classes of genes whose expression profiles are consistent with results from previous drought studies in conifers and angiosperms. the cdna sequences printed on ptgen <dig>  as well as the contigs to which they belong, can be accessed at the fungen website  <cit> . ptgen <dig> chips, detailed protocols, complete annotation files, and the .gal file can be obtained by contacting the authors.

molecular basis of drought tolerance in pine roots
root transcriptome responses to drought stress were characterized by  <dig> % of the genes interrogated with ptgen <dig> being differentially expressed by at least  <dig> -fold. forty-nine percent of de genes were up-regulated and 51% were down-regulated, indicating that down-regulation of transcripts is likely a non-trivial aspect of the drought response in p. taeda roots. a similar percentage of de genes  were also observed in p. taeda needles after cycles of mild and severe drought stress, and an approximately equal number of transcripts were both up- and down-regulated during the early stages of mild and severe drought stress  <cit> . analyses of transcriptome responses to water stress in angiosperms, e.g. arabidopsis  <cit> , rice  <cit> , barley  <cit> , and grape  <cit>  identified 4-16% of the genes interrogated as being differentially expressed. this is in stark contrast to populus subjected to gradual drought stress where only  <dig> % of all genes and < 1% of root-responsive genes were differentially expressed at a ≥ 2-fold level  <cit> . using a 2-fold cut-off for our data, the percentage of de genes in drought-stressed pine roots is reduced to  <dig> % which is still significantly higher than the populus value. a complete explanation for this difference remains to be elucidated.

the complexity of transcriptome responses to drought stress makes comparisons among the number and type of de genes identified in previous studies difficult as some differences are no doubt due to the duration and severity of stress, the tissue under study, the experimental design, and the statistical treatment of data. nevertheless, the differential expression patterns seen for specific classes of genes in this study were generally consistent with what has been documented in other plant species subjected to severe water or salt stress. many of the drought stress responsive genes found in this study, whether identified by the number of probes representing them, their log <dig> values, or by gene network analysis, have previously been well documented in angiosperm drought responses. this suggests evolutionary conservation of the molecular mechanisms utilized by both gymnosperms and angiosperms for response to water deficits. in drought-stressed roots, the majority of de genes displaying increased transcript abundance fall into the tolerance or protective category of drought-responsive genes, probably because the root samples were so severely stressed at the time of harvest that genes involved in early sensory and regulatory responses were underrepresented.

numerous studies have addressed the physiological recovery from drought stress in pines and conifers  <cit> , but very little information is available on transcriptome responses during drought recovery. what is clear from this study is that the transcript population in drought-stressed loblolly roots can return to nearly pre-drought transcript population levels within  <dig> hours of removing the stress . of  <dig> de genes identified in dr roots, 93% were found to be expressed at elevated levels in ds roots. one gene that stood out in drought recovery was a gibberellic acid-binding protein. however, we did not see differential expression in any gibberellic acid 2-oxidase genes, even though these genes have frequently been reported as induced by stress conditions, including drought. gibberellic acid signaling could have relevance for drought tolerance through its effect on plant morphology. future studies that include multiple time points to more precisely pinpoint when drought recovery begins and how long it takes to complete would help identification of transcriptome changes that occur early in the recovery process.

candidate protection genes
a large gene family commonly seen in drought response studies is the late embryogenesis abundant  proteins, which includes dehydrins  <cit> . their precise function is unknown, but they are believed to be involved in a number of protective processes, including acting as hydration buffers, antioxidants, metal ion binding proteins, and both enzyme and membrane stabilizers   <cit> . studies have shown the induction of lea and dehydrin transcripts, as well as increased production of the encoded proteins, in response to osmotic stress  <cit> . lea gene expression was previously shown to be up-regulated in pine shoot and stem tissues responding to drought stress  <cit> . twenty-six of the  <dig> probes on the ptgen <dig> microarray that appear to encode leas or dehydrins showed their genes to be up-regulated in ds roots. three of these  were highly induced and found to be highly ranked in the gene network analysis. this supports the belief that leas play an important role in mitigating the effects of drought stress and also demonstrates the identification of an expected class of drought-responsive genes by ptgen <dig>  these results also suggest that involvement lea gene function in drought tolerance is conserved among seed plants.

compatible solutes  are small solutes  that are thought to protect cells by maintaining turgor pressure and stabilizing proteins and membranes under osmotic-stress conditions  <cit> . sugar-based osmolytes, such as sucrose and raffinose family oligosaccharides , are thought to be particularly important for reducing the effects of osmotic stress in plants  <cit> . de genes thought to encode sucrose synthase, galactinol synthase, and raffinose synthase were up-regulated in drought stressed roots. genes thought to be involved in proline synthesis also were up-regulated, while almost all genes identified as "proline-rich protein" were down-regulated.

desiccation-tolerant plants accumulate high concentrations of sucrose during dehydration which, in conjunction with leas and dehydrins, may act to stabilize drying cells through direct interactions with macromolecules and membranes  <cit> . in maize ear and tassel tissues, sus transcripts increased during water deficit stress  <cit> . in a. scabra, a thermotolerant grass species, increased accumulation of sucrose synthase in the roots was proposed to contribute to superior root thermotolerance by regulating sucrose metabolism  <cit> . analysis of differentially expressed ests has shown increased sus transcript levels as well as elevated of sucrose levels in water-stressed citrus seedlings  <cit> . interestingly, sus transcript levels were induced in water-stressed populus leaves, but were consistently repressed in roots during the early stages of water deficit  <cit> . up-regulation of sus gene transcripts in water-stressed pine roots may be related to either the generation of sucrose or to the regulation of hexose flux. for example, both white spruce  and jack pine  seedlings accumulated higher concentrations of sucrose in roots relative to stems after exposure to elevated salt concentrations  <cit> , while in arabidopsis, sucrose synthase was shown to control intracellular glucose levels and transitory starch biosynthesis  <cit> . similar alterations in sugar metabolism likely occur in pine roots as all genes on the ptgen <dig> microarray encoding putative invertases and hexokinases were up-regulated under drought stress. one suggested regulatory mechanism for sus is that its role in sucrose cycling impacts flux through the hexokinase reaction  <cit>  meanwhile, both hexokinases and cell wall invertases are thought to play key regulatory roles in assimilate partitioning during stress  <cit> .

up-regulation of sus genes could also be related to raffinose family oligosaccharide  biosynthesis. galactinol synthase catalyzes the first committed step in rfo synthesis, utilizing sucrose and galactinol as substrates and, thus, plays a regulatory role in carbon partitioning  <cit> . in arabidopsis, it was shown that gols <dig> is responsible for heat stress-dependent synthesis of raffinose  <cit> , while both gols <dig> and gols <dig> are up-regulated in response to drought treatment. over-expression of gols <dig> in transgenic arabidopsis leads to improved drought tolerance  <cit> . it also has been suggested that the osmoprotectant ability of galactinol and raffinose is due to their participation in ros scavenging, because both can competitively inhibit hydroxyl radical-induced formation of  <dig> -dihydroxy-benzoic acid  in vitro  <cit> .

an inositol transporter gene  was highly ranked in the network analysis, which could suggest a role in osmoprotection. myo-inositol is a substrate for conjugation with galactose to form galactinol. accumulation of myo-inositol and its methylated derivatives is correlated with drought tolerance  <cit> , and it has been hypothesized that increased transport of inositols and its derivatives may act to counter osmotic stress  <cit> . the large number of up-regulated de genes related to the biosynthesis and regulation of osmolytes in conjunction with an inositol transporter hub gene strongly suggests an important role for osmoprotectants in the response of pine roots to drought stress. physiological and biochemical studies will be needed to address this hypothesis more thoroughly.

aquaporins  are members of the major intrinsic protein  family involved in increasing water diffusion across membranes by raising hydraulic or osmotic permeability  <cit> . disparate expression patterns for these proteins in response to water deficit is common and this, in conjunction with the large number of aqp genes typically found in plants as well as their highly variable tissue-specific expression patterns, have confounded attempts to determine their specific roles in drought response  <cit> . transgenic plants that over-express a class of aqps called plasma membrane intrinsic proteins  have shown both increased and decreased drought tolerance  <cit> . in this study,  <dig> of  <dig> probes for pine aqps responded to drought stress. most fell into the pip category, and  <dig> were down-regulated . in arabidopsis subjected to gradual drought stress, aqps were generally down-regulated  <cit> , as was the case for pips identified in tobacco  <cit>  and populus roots  <cit> . thus, down-regulation of aqps in drought-stressed pine roots appears to follow a pattern similar to that seen in some angiosperms and may reflect a mechanism for water conservation via reduced membrane permeability that minimizes water efflux into the surrounding soil  <cit> .

candidate regulatory genes
apparent transcription factors  from classes known to play a role in drought and abiotic stress responses in plants via aba-dependent and aba-independent mechanisms were differentially expressed in water-stressed pine roots. genes encoding putative dreb <dig>  bzip, ap2/erf, myb, nac, and wrky tfs were all up-regulated. an apparent wrky tf displayed the highest log <dig> ratio of any tf identified in ds roots. interestingly, one of the most common drought response regulatory genes  was not seen among the de genes in either ds or dr roots. on the other hand, dreb <dig> tfs are more often associated with cold stress in plants  <cit> . whether the apparent dreb <dig> identified in water-stressed pine roots plays a similar role to dreb <dig> in other plants remains to be determined.

correlation network analysis did not identify any of the up-regulated tfs in water-stressed pine roots as hub nodes. however, network analysis did identify three up-regulated de genes that may have a regulatory role in pine root responses to drought stress, cardiolipin synthase/phosphatidyltransferase, 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase, and zeatin o-glucosyltransferase, which could influence phospholipid metabolism, aba synthesis, and cytokinin availability, respectively. the most likely explanation for why "classic" regulatory tfs, such as dreb <dig> and bzip, were not seen as highly ranked network hubs in this study is a matter of experimental design. by the time water-stressed roots were harvested they were so severely stressed that transcription network dynamics may have progressed to a point where genes were more likely to be involved in stress mediation than to response of the onset of water deficiency. this would explain why the majority of up-regulated hubs listed in table  <dig> identified genes encoding proteins involved in protection from ros-mediated cell death , transport , cell/macromolecule protection , and defense .

we identified an apparent wrky gene up-regulated in both drought stress and drought recovery that is a candidate transcription factor for the regulation of drought response in pine roots. wrkys comprise a large family of conserved plant tfs that are up-regulated in response to wounding, infection, and abiotic stress and that play multiple roles in developmental and metabolic pathways  <cit> . in arabidopsis and rice, co-regulatory networks have been identified for wrky genes involved in both defense and osmotic stress responses  <cit> . wrky tfs induced by drought stress have been identified in rice and pennycress  <cit> , while an arabidopsis wrky tf has been shown to play a critical role in both aba response and drought tolerance  <cit> . drought tolerance has been conferred on transgenic arabidopsis expressing rice and soybean wrky genes  <cit> . recently, a wrky tf was shown to participate in dehydration tolerance by binding to w-box elements of the galactinol synthase promoter in boea hygrometrica  <cit> . given that all galactinol synthase genes showed increased transcript abundance in drought-stressed samples, we can speculate that their expression in pine roots may reflect regulation by a wrky tf.

aba is considered something of a universal stress hormone in higher plants and it plays a central role in the regulation of responses to abiotic stress  <cit> . although the primary site for aba synthesis is generally considered to be the roots , recent studies have suggested that aba synthesis may also occur in shoot tissues  <cit> . both aba-dependent and -independent signaling pathways have been described in stress responses to drought, salinity and cold  <cit> . the gene 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase  catalyzes the first dedicated step and is the key enzyme in aba biosynthesis  <cit> . in transgenic arabidopsis, an nced gene was shown to increase endogenous aba levels resulting in enhanced drought tolerance  <cit> . in legumes and shrub species undergoing water-deficit induced stress, elevated nced gene expression has been correlated with concomitant increases in aba  <cit> . a gene thought to encode nced was up-regulated in drought stressed pine roots and ranked high as a network hub. a second hub gene related to aba signaling  was also identified from the network analysis. these observations are consistent with the regulatory role that nceds are thought to play in response to water stress in angiosperms and makes nced a logical choice for having a similar function in pine roots.

other translocated factors, such as cytokinins, may also originate in roots and modulate aba signaling to impact shoot responses to drought  <cit> . the importance of cytokinins in drought-induced changes of root morphology has been suggested based on their accumulation in drought-stressed tobacco roots  <cit> . in this study, a gene encoding an apparent zeatin-o-glucosyl transferase  was strongly up-regulated and was identified as a potential network regulator, while a second zog and a cytokinin oxidase displayed moderate increases in transcript abundance. over-expression of zog <dig> in transgenic tobacco resulted in increased total cytokinin content, although bioactive cytokinins did not change significantly  <cit> . o-glucosylated forms of trans-zeatin are protected from oxidases and dehydrogenases and may act as cytokinin storage forms that can be converted quickly to bioactive cytokinins by the action of β-glucosidases  <cit> . reducing bioactive cytokinin availability via glucosylation may be a regulatory mechanism for lowering the cytokinin:aba ratio in pine roots to lessen the stimulatory effect of cytokinins on root meristematic tissue.

correlation network analysis is a powerful method for mining complex "omics" datasets and the evaluation of gene networks often leads to identification of novel genes involved in particular processes or pathways, as well as identification of putative regulatory genes. in plants, this approach has seen increasing use, particularly in model species. for example, a genome-wide co-expression network in arabidopsis identified  <dig> functional modules, fourteen of which were associated with stress and defense  <cit> , and correlation networks in arabidopsis  <cit>  and rice  <cit>  have identified co-expression modules that allude to the involvement of dreb genes in the regulation of trehalose-6-phosphate. however, few studies prior to this have specifically targeted drought responses.

in the current study, a variety of apparent transcription factors of classes known to regulate drought and water-deficit responses in other plants were found among de genes in pine roots; however, none of these ranked highly in the network analysis. the most highly ranked network hub gene, although it is of unknown function, is of great interest. other highly ranked hub genes appear related to protective functions rather than regulatory roles. nevertheless, the apparent nced and zog genes identified in this study have not been reported previously to respond to drought stress in pines. the crucial role these genes likely play in the aba and cytokinin signaling pathways, respectively, should make them foci for future molecular investigations of water-stress responses in roots.

CONCLUSIONS
a  <dig>  feature microarray, ptgen <dig>  fabricated for use in loblolly pine and conifer transcriptomic studies was used to identify  <dig> de genes  in ds roots and  <dig> de genes in dr roots after a  <dig> hour recovery period. differential gene expression returned to a near normal pattern within  <dig> hours of drought stress recovery indicating that transcriptome recovery from severe drought is a fairly rapid process in pine roots. approximately 30% of de genes identified in drought-stressed roots and 25% of the up-regulated hub nodes identified by weighted gene correlation network analysis had no significant homology to any known or identifiable genes , demonstrating the need for continued gene identification and annotation efforts in this species. coordinated gene expression patterns, along with gene network analysis, helped to identify a number of candidate genes that are likely involved in both protective and regulatory capacities in pine root water stress responses. to our knowledge, this is the largest conifer array yet produced and the first example of correlation gene network analysis being used to assess transcriptional responses to drought in any tree species. this study clearly demonstrates the utility of the ptgen <dig> microarray for evaluating transcriptome dynamics in pine and has identified numerous genes that will be the subject of future study as we expand our understanding of drought responses in this important commercial tree species.
