BACKGROUND
cells of various tissues employ ubiquitination to regulate multiple proteins including cell cycle regulators, transcription factors, and membrane proteins  <cit> . despite the diverse nature of ubiquitinated proteins, ubiquitination occurs in a common three step process  <cit> . first an ubiquitin activating, or e <dig> enzyme, binds ubiquitin in an atp-dependent-process. second, ubiquitin is transferred to an ubiquitin conjugating, or e <dig> enzyme. third, an ubiquitin ligase or e <dig> enzyme catalyzes the transfer of ubiquitin to its substrate. there are three classes of e <dig> ubiquitin ligases, hect  e <dig> ligases, ring-finger e <dig> ligases  <cit> , and u-box e <dig> ligases  <cit> . whereas hect e <dig> ligases directly bind ubiquitin prior to catalyzing substrate ligation, ring-finger and u-box e <dig> ligases do not bind ubiquitin, they function as adaptors, providing a physical link between the e <dig> enzyme and the substrate, catalyzing the transfer of ubiquitin directly from the e <dig> enzyme to the substrate  <cit> .

nedd4l  is a member of the nedd4-like family of e <dig> ubiquitin ligases. the nine members of the nedd4-like family in humans share a common domain organization that is evolutionarily conserved in the s. cerevisiae e <dig> ligase ortholog, rsp <dig>  <cit> . each contains two to four ww domains, which mediate substrate interactions, and a carboxy terminal hect domain, that catalyzes ubiquitin ligation and mediates interactions with e <dig> enzymes  <cit> . additionally, each family member contains a c <dig> domain–functionally known for its calcium dependent lipid binding ability–at its amino terminus. the discovery of multiple promoters that generate transcripts that contain a start codon either upstream or downstream of the c <dig> domain, reveals that in humans and rodents, nedd4l can be expressed as a protein containing or lacking a c <dig> domain   <cit> . the evolutionary conservation of c <dig> containing or lacking nedd4l isoforms across multiple vertebrates could underlie functional variability that could differentially affect nedd4l substrates.

the epithelial sodium channel  is a heteromultimeric transmembrane ion channel consisting of alpha, beta and gamma  subunits that is a critical mediator of sodium absorption in the epithelium of multiple tissues. enac expression at the apical side of the epithelium lining the lumen of the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron  positions enac as the ultimate determinant of renal sodium excretion  <cit> . it is thereby a critical factor in blood pressure regulation  <cit> . indeed, loss- or gain-of-function in enac subunits accounts for rare mendelian forms of hypo- or hypertension  <cit> . pseudohypoaldosteronism type i  is an autosomal recessive form of hypotension that is caused by loss-of-function mutations in either the α-, β- or γ-enac subunit  <cit> . liddle syndrome, in contrast, is an autosomal dominant form of hypertension that is caused by gain-of-function mutations that alter or delete py motifs in the cytoplasmic tails of either the β- or γ-enac subunit  <cit> . these py motifs interact with ww domains of nedd4l  <cit> , and the py motif mutations cause gain-of-function by increasing the cell-surface expression of enac. liddle's mutations are consistent with increased enac activity at  <cit> , an increase in the number of channels in  <cit> , and reduced enac endocytosis from the membrane  <cit> . liddle's py motif mutations also inhibit camp-mediated rapid translocation of enac from intracellular pools to the cell surface stimulated by vasopressin binding to the v <dig> vasopressin receptors  <cit> . combining these observations with those that demonstrate that enac is ubiquitinated by nedd4l  <cit>  and that nedd4l and enac expression in the asdn overlap  <cit>  suggested a mechanism that underlies liddle syndrome. impaired interaction between enac and nedd4l due to mutated py motifs reduces nedd4l-mediated enac ubiquitination, thereby decreasing enac endocytosis from the plasma membrane, leading to abnormally high sodium retention and ultimately hypertension.

essential hypertension, a major contributor to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality  <cit> , involves multiple genetic and environmental determinants  <cit> . this complex etiology prompted genetic analyses of intermediate blood pressure phenotypes  <cit> . a significant linkage peak for postural changes in blood pressure on chromosome 18q from a study conducted by the hypertension genetic epidemiology network contains human nedd4l  <cit> . we previously identified a common single nucleotide polymorphism  at the last nucleotide of exon  <dig> in nedd4l that alters exon  <dig> splice donor site selection  <cit>  . whereas the g variant leads to splicing of distinct mrnas encoding protein isoforms that either contain or lack the c <dig> domain  and nedd4l-c <dig> respectively), the a variant only produces mrnas that encode nedd4l-c <dig> . subsequent association studies implicate the g/a variant in blood pressure variation and salt sensitivity  <cit> .

the implication of nedd4l in liddle syndrome, genetic linkage of nedd4l to a blood pressure phenotype, and evidence that ties the g/a variant to blood pressure variation and salt sensitivity, supported the hypotheses that nedd4l participates in blood pressure regulation and that genetic variation in nedd4l such as the g/a variant could contribute to individual differences to susceptibility to essential hypertension. we investigated the functional relevance of the g/a variant by examining the localization behavior of nedd4l-c <dig> and nedd4l-c <dig> in x. laevis kidney epithelial  cells in the absence and presence of a calcium stimulus. published evidence regarding the functional interactions between nedd4l and enac  <cit>  and the availability of two clonal a <dig> cell lines that stably expressed functional α- or β-enac subunit as egfp fusion proteins  <cit> , provided the rationale and a cellular model to test the effect of potential functional differences between nedd4l-c <dig> and neddd4l-c <dig> on the nedd4l substrates α- or β-enac. we report that nedd4l-c <dig> and neddd4l-c <dig> isoforms exhibit distinct subcellular distributions and exert differential affects on the intracellular transport of enac subunits that depend on the ubiquitin ligase activity of the hect domain. we propose a model to account for the potential functional impact of the g/a variant on sodium handling and blood pressure regulation involving nedd4l and enac.

RESULTS
nedd4l-c <dig> localizes to the cytoplasm while nedd4l-c <dig> localizes to the cytoplasm and early endosome
to address the potential functional significance of the g/a variant on nedd4l subcellular localization, nedd4l-c <dig> and nedd4l-c <dig> were tagged with enhanced green fluorescent protein , transfected into a <dig>  cells, and imaged by using live cell confocal microscopy. egfp-nedd4l-c <dig> exhibited a diffuse cytoplasmic localization, similar to egfp alone . in addition to this cytoplasmic localization, egfp-nedd4l-c <dig> exhibited a distinct compartmental localization . these phenotypes were independent of the n- or c-terminal fusion of the egfp reporter  and did not reflect differential degradation of the two isoforms in western blot experiments . the egfp-nedd4l-c <dig> compartments partially colocalized with the early endosome marker transferrin-texas red®  but not with other organelle markers tested . we therefore conclude that when transiently expressed, egfp-nedd4l-c <dig> localizes to the cytoplasm while egfp-nedd4l-c <dig> localizes to the cytoplasm and to early endosomal compartments in a <dig> cells.

the presence or absence of a c <dig> domain affects intracellular nedd4l targeting in response to an increase in intracellular calcium
to test the calcium-dependent lipid targeting capability of the nedd4l c <dig> domain, a <dig> cells were transfected with egfp-nedd4l-c <dig> and egfp-nedd4l-c <dig>  incubated in the presence of ca2+ and ionomycin, and imaged. the protein kinase c alpha  c <dig> domain fused to egfp served as positive control  for calcium-dependent plasma membrane targeting  <cit> . prior to ionomycin treatment, egfp-pkcα-c <dig>  egfp-nedd4l-c <dig> and the egfp control localized to the cytoplasm while egfp-nedd4l-c <dig> localized to the cytoplasm and early endosome . upon incubation with ca2+ and ionomycin, egfp remained in the cytoplasm while egfp-pkcα-c <dig> moved to the plasma membrane . egfp-nedd4l-c <dig> was unaffected by ca2+ . in marked contrast, egfp-nedd4l-c <dig> relocalized to numerous small structures . repeating the experiment at a higher data acquisition rate showed that egfp-nedd4l-c <dig> transited first from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane and then to similar small structures . the same mobilization pattern was observed when only the c <dig> domain of nedd4l was fused to egfp . however, the use of various organelle markers did not allow the identification of these structures as lysosomes , golgi , mitochondria , endoplasmic reticulum , early endosomes , or autophagosomes  . the absence of colocalization with transferrin-texas red® suggests that ca2+ mobilization did not target egfp-nedd4l-c <dig> to labeled early endosomal compartments, the organelle in which egfp-nedd4l-c <dig> partially localized .

nedd4l-c <dig> differentially regulates α- and β-enac subunits in response to an increase in intracellular calcium
observations of the intracellular localization and mobilization of nedd4l-c <dig> in response to changes in intracellular calcium raised the hypothesis that nedd4l-c <dig> may affect the intracellular trafficking of its substrate enac. this hypothesis was tested by employing two a <dig> cell lines that stably expressed either the α- or the β-subunit of enac fused to egfp  <cit> . because nedd4l-c <dig> but not nedd4l-c <dig> relocalized in response to an increase in calcium, the α- and β-enac stably-expressing-cell-lines were transiently transfected with nedd4l-c <dig> that was labeled with the red fluorophore, mcherry ). intracellular trafficking in response to ionomycin and ca2+ treatment was monitored by time-lapse confocal microscopy. in cells stably expressing α-enac-egfp, mcherry-nedd4l-c <dig> mobilization occurred in three distinct steps . first, mcherry-nedd4l-c <dig> moved from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane . second, mcherry-nedd4l-c <dig> transited to the periphery of some of the vesicles containing α-enac-egfp . third, mcherry-nedd4l-c <dig> moved back to the plasma membrane . despite partial photo-bleaching of the egfp fluorophore and fluctuation of the cellular monolayer, the localization of α-enac-egfp remained unaltered throughout the time lapse . in cells stably expressing β-enac-egfp, mcherry-nedd4l-c <dig> mobilization proceeded through the same three distinct steps observed above . a notable and consistent difference however, was that in the third step, β-enac relocated to the plasma membrane together with mcherry-nedd4l-c <dig> .

nedd4l-c <dig> trafficking of β-enac to the plasma membrane requires ubiquitin ligase activity
mutation of the hect domain catalytic cysteine residue to alanine abolishes nedd4l-mediated ubiquitination of α and β-enac  <cit> . to test whether relocation of mcherry-nedd4l-c <dig> with β-enac to the plasma membrane was dependent on mcherry-nedd4l-c <dig> ubiquitin ligase activity, the cysteine residue  was mutated to alanine to make the construct mcherry-nedd4l-c2-c943a. transfection of a <dig> cells that stably-expressed β-enac-egfp with mcherry-nedd4l-c2-c943a and time lapse confocal microscopy of live cells following the addition of ionomycin were performed as above . in response, mcherry-nedd4l-c2-c943a first moved from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane . then mcherry-nedd4l-c2-c943a transited to the periphery of some of the vesicles containing β-enac-egfp . unlike wild-type mcherry-nedd4l-c <dig> however, catalytically inactive mcherry-nedd4l-c2-c943a did not relocate to the plasma membrane . also unlike wild-type mcherry-nedd4l-c <dig> transfected cells, β-enac-egfp did not mobilize to the plasma membrane either .

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
the availability of two clonal a <dig> cell lines that stably overexpress functional α- or β-enac subunits as egfp fusion proteins, provided a relevant cellular model to test the effect of potential functional differences between nedd4l-c <dig> and neddd4l-c <dig> on the nedd4l substrates α- or β-enac. furthermore, using the a <dig> cell culture system allowed functional comparisons in the presence and absence of enac subunit overexpression. we report that nedd4l-c <dig> and nedd4l-c <dig> exhibit different subcellular localizations and distinct mobilization responses to a calcium stimulus. additionally, we report that nedd4l-c <dig> differentially affects short term trafficking of α- and β-enac subunits after a calcium stimulus. moreover, the effect of nedd4l-c <dig> on a segment of β-enac trafficking is ubiquitin dependent.

we observed that the presence or absence of the c <dig> domain affected the subcellular localization of nedd4l. nedd4l-c <dig> and nedd4l-c <dig> were labeled with egfp and transfected into a <dig> cells. whereas egfp-nedd4l-c <dig> localized to the cytoplasm, egfp-nedd4l-c <dig> localized to the cytoplasm and early endosome. although it is unclear what functional significance nedd4l-c <dig> localization to the early endosome may have, it is plausible that the absence of the c <dig> domain prevents or hinders nedd4l-c <dig> targeting to intracellular sites beyond the early endosome.

we observed the mobilization response of egfp-nedd4l-c <dig> and egfp-nedd4l-c <dig> following an increase in intracellular calcium. a <dig> cells that had been transfected with either fusion protein were incubated in  <dig>  mm ca2+ and imaged immediately after the addition of  <dig> μm ionomycin. the ca2+ concentration is within typical ranges of ca2+ concentrations that are used in studies that characterize intracellular c <dig> domain translocation  <cit> . while egfp-nedd4l-c <dig> did not respond to the ca2+ stimulus, egfp-nedd4l-c <dig> mobilized from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane and then to small intracellular compartments. these compartments were not targeted by transferrin texas red®, a marker of the early endosome, or other subcellular organelle markers used .

the availability of distinct a <dig> cell lines that stably express α- or β-enac, combined with the observation that like nedd4l-c <dig>  enac localizes in this overexpression system to unidentified intracellular compartments  <cit> , provided a means and rationale to test the effect of nedd4l-c <dig> mobilization on a well characterized substrate. because α- and β-enac were stably expressed as egfp fusion proteins  <cit> , nedd4l-c <dig> was tagged with the red fluorophore, mcherry. mcherry-nedd4l-c <dig> exhibited a similar calcium-dependent localization response in cells that expressed either α-enac-egfp or egfp-β-enac. this process occurred in three steps. first, mcherry-nedd4l-c <dig> moved from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane. second, mcherry-nedd4l-c <dig> transited to the periphery of some of the vesicles that contained enac subunits. third, mcherry-nedd4l-c <dig> moved back to the plasma membrane. mcherry-nedd4l-c <dig> did not affect the localization of α-enac-egfp. however, in cells that expressed egfp-β-enac, mcherry-nedd4l-c <dig> transited to the plasma membrane with egfp-β-enac in the third mobilization step.

ubiquitination is intimately involved in several aspects of the intracellular trafficking of various proteins  <cit> . we therefore tested whether the co-transit of nedd4l-c <dig> and β-enac to the plasma membrane in response to an increase in intracellular calcium was ubiquitination dependent. to ablate the ubiquitin ligase capability of nedd4l-c <dig>  the catalytic cysteine  <dig>  in the hect domain was mutated to alanine. c <dig> forms a thioester linkage with ubiquitin prior to substrate ligation and this association is required for substrate ubiquitination. the functional significance of c <dig> is supported by its conservation in nedd4l orthologs from humans to yeast. in the context of enac regulation, mutation of the catalytic cysteine to alanine abolishes nedd4l mediated β-enac ubiquitination  <cit> . in the mobilization response to an increase in intracellular calcium, mcherry-nedd4l-c2-c943a first transited from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane and then transited to the periphery of some vesicles that contained β-enac-egfp. however, unlike the mobilization response of wild-type mcherry-nedd4l-c <dig>  neither mcherry-nedd4l-c2-c943a nor β-enac-egfp subsequently transited to the plasma membrane.

the paradigm of e <dig> enzyme function within the ubiquitin system implies that e3s down-regulate or sequester their substrate targets. ubiquitination results in substrate transport to the proteasome and lysosome  or to endosomal compartments where proteins remain intact but sequestered until needed and recycled for future use  <cit> . it is not clear how our observation of mcherry-nedd4l-c <dig> and β-enac-egfp mobilization from intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane would facilitate nedd4l mediated enac down-regulation. since β-enac is active at the cell surface this inside-out movement propels β-enac towards its functional locale. this trafficking step may therefore correspond to β-enac mobilization from an intracellular pool or recycling. recent work using live-cell imaging and gfp-labeled enac subunits overexpressed in polarized kidney epithelial  cells, has shown that camp can stimulate rapid enac trafficking, more from replenishment than recycling, to the apical surface from an intracellular pool  <cit> . furthermore, this rapid camp-stimulated replenishment is dependent on the presence of intact py motifs because it is impaired by py-motif mutants of enac suggesting that the py motifs play a role in regulating exocytic trafficking of the channel. these results confirmed earlier work in rat thyroid cells demonstrating that camp stimulation of enac was dependent on the py motif in the cooh terminus of each subunit, with the most pronounced effect seen with a truncating mutation in the β-enac subunit  <cit> .

the observation here that neither catalytically inactive nedd4l -c943a) nor β-enac-egfp mobilize to the plasma membrane suggests that ubiquitination is necessary for wild-type nedd4l ) and β-enac-egfp co-transit to the plasma membrane. this result is surprising considering that ubiquitination of enac as well as myriad other proteins typically leads to internalization and functional down-regulation  <cit> . however, our observation of ubiquitin-dependent mobilization of β-enac by nedd4l-c <dig> provides a novel mechanism for the py motif-dependent enac mobilization from intracellular pools by camp. multiple reports suggest that intracellular calcium oscillations can be mediated by camp in renal collecting duct cells  <cit> . a camp mediated increase in intracellular calcium could trigger nedd4l-c <dig> mobilization and targeting of intracellular compartments that contain β-enac. subsequent co-transiting of nedd4l-c <dig> with β-enac from intracellular pools to the cell surface could occur in a py motif-dependent manner due to the requirement for interactions with nedd4l-c <dig> ww domains.

the observation that mcherry-nedd4l-c <dig> mobilizes to the plasma membrane independently in a <dig> cells that stably express α-enac  suggests that fluorescently labeled enac subunits may not be the only substrate that are ubiquitinated. future investigations that employ alternate experimental approaches should provide more detailed insight into the mechanisms of nedd4l and enac trafficking. likewise, the functional effects of the observed co-mobilization between mcherry-nedd4l-c <dig> and β-enac should be correlated with functional sodium transport studies.

the differential trafficking effect of nedd4l-c <dig> on α- and β-enac subunits is consistent with differential subunit trafficking observed in other contexts. in a <dig> cells an increase in the density of β-enac subunits, but not α- or γ-enac subunits, at the cell membrane in response to aldosterone and vasopressin stimuli has been observed  <cit> . aldosterone-mediated-regulation of enac occurs at least in part by activating the serum glucocorticoid-inducible kinase  <dig>   <cit> . subsequent phosphorylation of nedd4l hinders the interaction between nedd4l and enac thereby reducing the negative regulatory effect of nedd4l on enac  <cit> . in vivo vasopressin induces a significant increase of the β-enac subunit compared to the α-enac subunit in rat kidney  <cit>  as well. furthermore, a model that describes intracellular enac trafficking proposes that its subunits are transported individually, independent of each other, in a non-coordinate manner  <cit> .

the differential regulation of intracellular trafficking as a function of the presence or absence of a c <dig> domain may extend to other substrates of nedd4l, including the dopamine transporter   <cit> , and to other nedd4-like e <dig> ligases, including the nedd4l paralog nedd4- <dig> . moreover, nedd4-like proteins have been implicated in the process of viral budding due to the potential interaction between nedd4-like ww domains and viral late domains that contain proline-rich motifs  <cit> . viral pathogens could therefore exploit the differential trafficking behavior and intracellular localization between nedd4l-c <dig> and nedd4l-c <dig> to suit aspects of their pathogenesis. two recent publications indicate that nedd4l-c <dig> can more potently correct human immunodeficiency virus type  <dig>  release defects in 293t cells compared to nedd4l-c <dig>  <cit> . we observed that nedd4l-c <dig> localizes predominately to transferrin-labeled early endosomal compartments instead of the cytoplasm like nedd4l-c <dig> . a recent study demonstrated that hiv- <dig> localizes to transferrin-labeled early endosomal compartments  <cit> . perhaps the ability of nedd4l-c <dig> to correct more readily hiv- <dig> release compared to nedd4l-c <dig> is the result of the preferential localization of nedd4l-c <dig> to early endosomal compartments where hiv- <dig> is present, thereby facilitating interactions that promote viral egress.

our data support the hypothesis that the g/a variant impacts enac-dependent sodium handling in the asdn by affecting the relative synthesis of nedd4l-c <dig> and nedd4l-c <dig>  individual differences in the regulation of sodium balance mediated by this genotype may contribute modest but definite individual differences in the liability to develop essential hypertension through a sodium dependent mechanism. our cellular observations suggest a mechanism accounting for recently reported clinical correlations between the genotype of the g/a variant and responses to acute sodium loading as well as changes in blood pressure  <cit> . greater synthesis of the nedd4l-c <dig> isoform relative to the nedd4l-c <dig> isoform may favor apical recycling or mobilization from intracellular pools, thereby generating a greater apical density of enac channels in the asdn through regulation of the β-enac subunit, without concurrent effects on the α-enac subunit.

the cellular observations provide a framework for future investigations of the potential relationship between genetic variation in nedd4l affecting relative expression of c2-defined isoforms, subcellular trafficking and regulation of enac subunits, and whether and how such genetic variation can contribute to individual susceptibility to develop essential hypertension. it is of particular interest whether our observations relate to enac activity. electrophysiological experiments that would investigate amiloride sensitive sodium current in a similar tissue culture system would be a logical approach to resolve this issue. while we exploited published evidence regarding interaction between enac and nedd4l as well as the availability of a cellular model system  <cit> , the functional implications of c2-containing and c2-lacking nedd4l isoforms may extend beyond blood pressure control to other nedd4l mediated processes including viral pathogenesis  <cit>  and regulation of dopamine transport  <cit> .
