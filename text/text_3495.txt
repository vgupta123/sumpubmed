BACKGROUND
plant mitochondrial genomes are remarkable from both evolutionary and comparative genomics stand-points. like their animal counterparts, plant mitochondrial genomes generally are characterized as circular chromosomes  <cit>   that contain a variable number of genes interspersed within non-coding dna; however, this simplistic generalization belies the dynamic and complex nature of plant mitochondrial genomes  <cit> . not only is the overall structure mitochondrial genomes an oversimplification of their possible morphologies , but recent comparative analyses among flowering plants have demonstrated extensive fluidity in plant mitochondrial genomes  <cit> . the structure and evolution of angiosperm mitochondrial genomes are driven by extremely high rates of recombination and rearrangement, with major rearrangements detected even in hybrid plants  <cit> . paradoxically, mitochondrial genes are among the slowest evolving, and this rate paradox can be partially explained by dna repair mechanisms  <cit> . dna repair in the coding regions of the mitochondria is biased toward gene conversion, reducing the mutation rates within genes, whereas the more inaccurate break-induced replication  is common in the noncoding regions, leading to the expansions and rearrangements observed outside of genes . consequently, plant mitochondrial genomes vary remarkably both in size and composition within plant families and genera  <cit> , with genome sizes ranging from  <dig> kilobases in some algae to several megabases in certain angiosperms  <cit> . intraspecies comparisons suggest that plant mitochondrial genomes can be highly divergent even among different varieties of the same species  <cit> , and together with the observed genomic diversity within a single order of angiosperms  <cit> , further indicates the remarkable diversity in mitochondrial genomes among green plants  <cit> .

perhaps the two most surprising recent realizations regarding plant mitochondrial genome evolution are the extensive variability in mitochondrial genome size and the compositional changes that have led to this variability. plant mitochondrial genomes vary by an amazing 870-fold, from the ultra-compact, 12 kb  genome  of the alga polytomella capuana  <cit>  to the spectacularly bloated  <dig>  kb genome  of silene conica  <cit> . the evolutionary dynamics that underlie this remarkable variation are not fully understood; however, it is clear from several analyses that plant mitochondrial genomes are repositories for dna from myriad sources  <cit> . these not only include the nucleus and chloroplast genomes of the host species itself, but may also include sequences derived from the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes of other species  <cit> . much of this sequence is large  and repetitive in nature  <cit> , providing sufficient tracts of homology to promote the highly dynamic recombination evident in plant mitochondrial genomes . indeed, it is the high rates of sequence acquisition/loss and recombination that give plant mitochondrial genomes their reputation for rapid intergenic evolution, leading to low levels of non-genic homology among even closely related species  <cit> . furthermore, this propensity for recombination can have additional intriguing consequences, such as the generation of substoichiometic recombinant molecules  <cit> , variable chromosomal structures  <cit> , and novel cytoplasmic male sterility -inducing open reading frames   <cit> .

despite the extensive variation in sizes and structures of plant mitochondrial genomes, their coding sequences rank among the most slowly evolving genes known  <cit> . although considerable gene- and lineage-specific variation in rates of gene retention/loss exist for both protein and trna genes  <cit> , most sequenced angiosperm mitochondrial genomes have ~50– <dig> genes, including subunits of respiratory complexes, ribosomal rnas , and transfer rnas   <cit> , and a variable number of pseudogenized forms and/or copies of mitochondrial genes .

sea island cotton  is a new world allotetraploid  grown in many countries because of its superior quality fiber  <cit> . upland cotton , however, is more commonly grown because it is earlier maturing and has a higher yield potential, and accordingly it now accounts for about 90 % of world fiber production. sea island cotton  accounts for only approximately 5 % of present global commerce  <cit> . in addition to its superior spinning performance and unique high quality fiber characteristics, sea island cotton is a potential source of genes for resistance to verticillium wilt  <cit> . the objective of the present study was to complement earlier efforts  <cit>  to generate a high-quality sequence of the mitochondrial genome of g. barbadense. we provide this sequence and compare it to the mitogenome of g. hirsutum  <cit> , resulting in insights to the evolution of structural variation and new fields into mtdna duplicated copy gene.

methods
plant materials and mitochondrial dna extraction
mitochondria were isolated from week-old etiolated seedlings of “pima 90–53”, a variety of sea island cotton  whose seeds were obtained from hebei agricultural university  <cit> . mitochondrial dna was extracted from isolated organelles as reported  <cit> . briefly, the extraction protocol for the mtdna of sea island cotton was as follows:the seeds were planted in sand and the seedlings were kept in darkness to obtain etiolated seedlings. from these,  <dig> d-old etiolated seedlings were ground and used to isolate mitochondria.

ground seedlings were collected and further purified by centrifugation in a discontinuous sucrose-density gradient  in purification buffer  

the mitochondria band from the interface between 52 % and 36 % was carefully collected and washed with  <dig>  mol · l− <dig> sucrose buffer to obtain the intact mitochondrial fractions.

the mitochondrail fraction was lysed in cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide  for release of mtdna, and further purified by proteinase k digestion, phenol-chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation.



the plastid band was located in the interface between 36 % and 20 % sucrose, while the nuclei were precipitated to the bottom. pcr validation failed to detect nuclear contamination, but did detect partial contamination from plastid dna . to avoid contamination from chloroplast, we filtered the reads based on the sequence of gossypium barbadense chloroplast genome before assembly.

mitochondrial genome sequencing and assembly
isolated sea island cotton mitochondrial dna was cloned into whole-genome shotgun libraries using copycontrol fosmid library production kit  and sequenced to about  <dig> × coverage with solexa using paired-end, 90 bp read at beijing genomics institute . adaptor and contaminant sequences were removed from the raw reads and the clean reads were assembled using abyss  <cit> . since nuclear and chloroplast contamination is possible in the extraction procedure, blastn  <cit>  against nt/nr database was used to identify and remove contaminant contigs. in addition, known mitochondrial genome sequences of g. hirsutum  <cit>  and g. harknessii  were also used to identify mitochondrial-type contigs. contigs were ordered/oriented and gaps were closed via additional fosmid and bac sequencing. primers representing both conserved mitochondrial genes and scaffold terminals were used to screen both a fosmid library  <cit>  and a bac library  <cit> . twenty fosmid clones  and two bac clones were selected by this pcr screen and independently sequenced by solexa and  <dig> sequencing methods in bgi and shanghai majorbio bio-pharm biotechnology, respectively. the resulting clones were assembled with soapdenovo  <cit>  and newbler , respectively; these were then used to anchor and orient the previously assembled mitochondrial contigs into supercontigs. to close the remaining gaps, the known relationships of the fosmids were used to predict the order and orientation of contigs, and the remaining gaps were filled by la-pcr  using the primers listed in additional file 3: table s <dig>  these primers were also used to verify each contig joined.

genome annotation and sequence analysis
mitochondrial genes were annotated as reported  <cit> , using the genes annotated in the g. hirsutum mtdna as references. functional genes  were identified by local blast searches against the database, whereas trna genes were predicted de novo using trnascan-se  <cit> . a genome map  was generated using ogdraw  <cit>  and the repeat map was drawn by circos  <cit> .fig.  <dig> genome map of gossypium barbadense mitochondrial genome. the map shows both the gene map  and repeat map . genes exhibited on the inside of outer circle are transcribed in a clockwise direction, while genes on the outside of outer circle are transcribed in a reverse direction. the inner circle reveals the distribution of repeats in g. barbadense mt genome with curved lines and ribbons connecting pairs of repeats and width proportional to repeat size. the red ribbons represent > =  <dig> kb repeats and the blue lines represent repeats between 100 bp to  <dig> kb. the numbers give genome coordinates in kilobases



the newly generated g. barbadense sequence was aligned to the published g. hirsutum mitochondrial sequence  <cit> , and the values of ds and dn/ds were evaluated with paml <dig>  <cit> . pipmaker was used to identify repeated sequences within g. barbadense  <cit> , and repetitive dna from nuclear sources was identified using repeatmasker  and a custom, gossypium-enriched repeat database. dot matrix comparisons were generated between the mitochondrial genome of g. barbadense and those of arabidopsis thaliana, carica papaya, and g. hirsutum using the nucmer program of mummer with the parameters: 100-bp minimal size for exact match and 500-bp minimal interval between every two matches  <cit> . we used circos plots  <cit>  to show the collinear relationships between g. barbadense and g. hirsutum mitochondrial genome sequences. possible pseudogenes and non-functional trnas were predicted using previously published mitochondrial genomes, and the distribution of pseudogenes was drawn by program pheatmap in r. a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on  <dig> conserved mitochondrial genes  using maximum likelihood  method with the model gtr + g + i in mega <dig>   <cit> .

RESULTS
assembly of the complete g. barbadense mitochondrial genome
a total of  <dig> mbp  of clean reads was generated for the g. barbadense mitochondrial genome. these reads were initially assembled into  <dig> contigs , ranging in size from  <dig>  bp to  <dig>  bp. because repeated sequences hinder the assembly of these contigs into a single circular chromosome,  <dig> fosmid clones and two bac clones were sequenced and used to inform the order and orientation of these contigs. in addition, the previously published physical map of the g. barbadense mitochondrial genome was also used  <cit> . the order and orientation of contigs was confirmed and remaining gaps were filled using pcr . the sea island mitochondrial genome was assembled as a  <dig>  bp circular molecule with four large repeats  , similar to an earlier prediction of mitogenome size   <cit> .

comparative analysis of g. barbadense and g. hirsutum mitochondrial genomes
the mitochondrial genomes of g. barbadense and g. hirsutum  <cit>  are largely similar; however, as observed in other genera, many differences exist even between these closely related species . the size difference between the mitochondrial genomes of g. barbadense and g. hirsutum is about 9 %, representing almost 56 kb of additional sequence in g. barbadense. in terms of nucleotide composition, the two mitochondrial genomes are almost identical, with the gc content of g. barbadense and g. hirsutum being  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively. likewise, a similar number of genes were predicted for both, with g. barbadense having seven more functional genes annotated than did g. hirsutum , including  <dig> additional protein coding genes,  <dig> additional rrna genes, and one more trna gene, generating a slightly higher gene length in the g. barbadense than in the g. hirsutum mitochondrial genome . in total,  <dig> protein coding genes,  <dig> rrna genes, and  <dig> trna genes were predicted for g. barbadense. most of these genes were intact, even in the duplicate copies; however, both the sole nad <dig> and the rps <dig> copy displayed deviations from expectations for intact genes .table  <dig> general features of mitochondrial genomes of g. barbadense and g. hirsutum

a total of  <dig> protein-coding genes,  <dig> rrna-coding genes and  <dig> trna-coding genes were identified , in addition to  <dig> pseudogenes and  <dig> chloroplast-derived sequences. genes present in duplicate are denoted with a hyphenated number . a represents the second gene copy to g. barbadense




as with the annotated genes, the amount of chloroplast-derived sequence was similar between the two mitochondrial genomes, with g. barbadense having  <dig>  kb less identifiable chloroplast-derived sequence . in g. barbadense,  <dig> fragments ranging from 35 bp to  <dig>  bp in size, contribute  <dig>  bp of sequence to the genome  versus  <dig>  bp in g. hirsutum. most of the inserted sequences in both cases were either non-coding or were trnas. with respect to trnas, both have nearly the same set of trnas; however, g. barbadense has additional copy of trnd-cp, but lacks one of the five conserved cp-derived trnas  <cit>  .

together, the differences between the two cotton mitochondrial genomes attributable to gene or chloroplast-derived sequence represent a small fraction of the difference in genome size . as expected from the nature of plant mitochondrial genomes, the greatest difference was in the proportion of repeated sequences, with approximately  <dig>  times more sequence in g. barbadense derived from repetitive sequences than in g. hirsutum . interestingly, the amount of sequence attributable to identifiable transposable elements comprised only  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of the repetitive sequences detected in the g. barbadense and g. hirsutum mitochondrial genomes, respectively. the remainder of the sequence was unclassified repetitive sequences contained within the mitochondrial genomes themselves. as with nuclear genomes, gypsy elements comprised the largest fraction of the identifiable repetitive sequences, and followed by unclassified ltr-retrotransposons and transposable elements.

the presence and distribution of short repeats also distinguished the two mitochondrial genomes, with  <dig> and  <dig> repeats larger than 19 bp in g. barbadense and g. hirsutum, respectively . as in g. hirsutum, g. barbadense short repeats were typically small   <cit> . therefore, while the short repeats were more numerous, their small length had relatively little effect compared to the large repeats  . in fact, most of the genome expansion in g. barbadense is attributable to the largest repeat , contributing a full  <dig>  % of the genome, as well as several duplicated rrna genes . such large repeats have precedence in plant mitochondrial genomes, including, for example, a 120-kb repeat in maize  <cit>  and an 87-kb repeat in beta  <cit> . in total, the proportion of repeats in g. barbadense was nearly  <dig>  times that of g. hirsutum .table  <dig> frequency distribution of repeat lengths in the mitogenomes of g. hirsutum and g. barbadense

syntenic regions and rearrangement
syntenic regions were identified between g. barbadense and a. thaliana, c. papaya, and g. hirsutum, respectively. plant mitochondrial genomes are known to experience myriad synteny-disrupting rearrangements over short evolutionarily timescales, and, reflecting this, appreciable synteny was limited to the g. barbadense - g. hirsutum comparison . a set of  <dig> sequence blocks larger than  <dig> kb with high homology  were detected between the g. barbadense and g. hirsutum mitochondrial genomes, here named block  <dig> to block  <dig>  respectively . the sizes of these eight syntenic blocks ranged from  <dig>  kb  to  <dig>  kb . interestingly, after the four large repeats  were identified on the g. barbadense mitochondrial genome , we also found a short direct repeat “r08”  at the ends of large repeat r <dig> . interestingly, r <dig> is duplicated in g. barbadense whereas it exists as single copy in g. hirsutum, suggesting either a gain in g. barbadense or a loss in g. hirsutum. compared to the bordering syntenic block  <dig> and block  <dig> , the small repeats at the ends of r <dig> that might account for the large duplication event and supply some information on the origin of r <dig> since the divergence from a common ancestor. it bears noting, however, that the assembled circular map likely represents only one of several possible actual configurations of the genome. mitochondrial repeats frequently recombine, resulting in an equilibrium composed of multiple configurations . as both species of cotton probably include several isoforms, differing by repeat-based configurations. the placement of these repeats relative to other syntenic blocks suggest there exists interspecies reorganization during the evolution of g. barbadense and g. hirsutum. notably, however, the rearrangements detected between these two mitochondrial genomes did not disrupt gene clusters, which mostly were in syntenic regions. further sequencing of additional cotton mitochondrial genomes will be necessary to elucidate the extent and fluidity of genomic rearrangements in cotton mitochondrial genomes.fig.  <dig> dot matrix analyses between g. barbadense and g. hirsutum, c. papaya, a. thaliana  by whole genomic alignment. the blue and red lines refer inverted and direct syntenic regions, respectively

nucleotide-level changes in cotton mitochondrial genomes
synonymous substitution rates  of orthologous gene pairs serve as a useful measure of evolutionary distance  <cit> . the average ks values for  <dig> collinear mitochondrial gene pairs were  <dig>  for either g. barbadense or g. hirsutum versus c. c. papaya , about 1/10th the value for nuclear genes  <cit> . these data indicate the commonly observed low mutation rates for mitochondrial genes, likely because of efficient dna repair mechanisms  <cit> . these data, as well as paired t-tests  indicate that the two gossypium mitochondrial genomes have had equal mutation rates. dn/ds ratios for six genes  in both mitochondrial genomes were greater than  <dig> , suggesting that these genes may have experienced positive selection during divergence from the common ancestor of gossypium and c. papaya.fig.  <dig> distribution of ks values between two cotton mitochondrial genomes and c. papaya

pseudogenes in mitochondrial genomes of land plants
as mentioned above, the suite and synteny of genes was largely conserved between g. barbadense and g. hirsutum. likewise, both cotton genomes shared the relatively few potential pseudogenes. this is interesting because while complex i, iii, iv, and v genes  are generally universally conserved in land plant mitochondrial genomes  <cit> , pseudogenes also are ubiquitous  <cit> . to explore further the patterns of pseudogenization in mitochondrial genes, we analyzed all  <dig> currently sequenced mitochondrial genomes deposited in ncbi . this comparison revealed that:  pseudogenes may arise from any category of mitochondrial genes and from the chloroplast genome;  the frequency of pseudogenization  is highest for ribosomal protein genes, and lower for genes encoding subunits of the respiratory chain proteins. this is consistent with a prior analysis of pseudogene distribution of  <dig> protein-coding genes among  <dig> land plants mitochondrial genomes  <cit> , who also reported that pseudogenes mainly occurred in complex ii subunit of the respiratory chain  and ribosomal protein genes ;  some pseudogenes are lineage-specific ; and  the presence of multi-copy pseudogenes in some mitochondrial genomes , as observed here and in previously  <cit>  , may indicate further duplication during pseudogene formation. recent research has shown that some pseudogenized genes followed endogenous functional gene transfer to the nucleus  <cit>  leading to the gradual mutational degradation of the corresponding mitochondrial copies. in addition, the tendency for ribosomal genes to pseudogenized more frequently may be associated with three sets of translation systems in a single cell compartment that leads to more “gene replacement”  <cit> . analysis of additional mitochondrial genomes will help illuminate these trends.table  <dig> pseudogenes in  <dig> mitochondrial genomes sequenced

apossible pseudogenes,  two copies of pseudogenes, cp pseudogenes of chloroplast origin and gossypium species are given in bold

fig.  <dig> distribution of pseudogenes in  <dig> mitochondrial genomes sequenced of land plants. the scale of pseudogene number is depicted on the side, and ranges from  <dig> copies to  <dig> copies, with  <dig>  representing possible pseudogenes. the numbers 1– <dig> on the x-axis correspond to the number given to each mitochondrial genome 



rps <dig> gene transfer in pieces into the gossypium mitochondrial genome
like vitis, rps <dig> have partial duplicated copy in the mtdna of the gossypium. in both the mitochondrial genomes of g. barbadense and g. hirsutum, there was a duplicated copy of rps <dig>  which was nearly identical to its corresponding ortholog rps <dig>  horizontal gene transfer  into mitochondrial genomes is a propensity noted previously , however, the primary source of the divergent copy of rps <dig> is not from hgt but rather from the mtdna of gossypium itself. the full-length gene of rps <dig> in gossypium is  <dig>  bp, and contains two exons and one intron . in both gossypium mitochondrial genomes, however, rps3- <dig> is truncated at the end of the second exon . the missing part of this exon in rps3- <dig> was not found elsewhere in either cotton mitochondrial genome, even when using a relaxed blast of 1e− <dig> to 1e− <dig>  to explore the possibility that the latter half of this exon was copied within the cotton mitochondrial genome and then subsequently migrated to the nucleus, we used the published genomes of g. raimondii   <cit>  and g. arboreum   <cit>  as blast databases . interestingly, the latter half of exon  <dig>  was recovered from g. arboreum chromosome  <dig> , along with 755 bp of additional mitochondrial sequence derived from the flanking region of rps <dig> . the percent identity between the intact mitochondrial sequence and the nuclear copy is ~97 %, which is similar to the average difference in non-coding regions for nuclear genes in the a- and d- genome cottons. these observations are interesting for two reasons. first, the recovery of this mitochondrial sequence from the g. arboreum  only, which is also the model maternal progenitor for both g. barbadense and g. hirsutum  <cit> , suggests that this mitochondria to nuclear transfer occurred subsequent to the divergence of the a- and d- genomes of cotton, which is estimated to have been 5– <dig> mya; the level of sequence divergence suggests that the transfer occurred shortly after the divergence of the a- and d- lineages. second, the formation of rps3- <dig> was complex, involving both sequence duplication and intracellular transfer. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the sequence r2′  was duplicated , including part of rps <dig> transferred to nuclear genome, and the remnant sequences of r2′ remained in mitochondrial genome. these remnant sequences became rps3- <dig> and r <dig>  respectively.fig.  <dig> the putative origin mechanism of rps3- <dig> and r <dig>  a a structural comparison of rps <dig> and rps3- <dig> is shown in the top panel. exons are depicted as black bars, introns as straight lines, and the striped box indicates the exonic sequence lost in rps3- <dig>  locations for each of the exons are given in parentheses b the lower panel illustrates the possible formation mechanism of rps3- <dig> and r <dig>  a2: chr.  <dig> represents chromosome  <dig> in the g. arboreum genome and mt represents mitochondrial genome of g. barbadense, with the top mt graph indicating the arrangement before transferring and the bottom indicating the arrangement after intracellular transferring. the red rectangle and red bar indicate the transferred sequences from the mitochondrial genome to the nuclear genome, respectively. the blue bar represents the flanking sequences transferred along with the latter half of exon  <dig>  depicted again as a striped box. included in these graphs are the bordering regions between rp <dig> and r2′  and between rps3- <dig> and r <dig> 

fig.  <dig> alignment of rp <dig> from the g. barbadense mitochondrial genome and the corresponding transfer found in the g. arboreum nuclear genome. here, 1–755 bp in the alignment represents the 5′ flanking regions of rps <dig>  and 756– <dig>  bp consists of exon2- <dig> from the intact and transferred rps <dig> copy, respectively



patterns of trna presence in plant mitochondrial genomes
while plant mitochondrial genomes possess native trnas, nuclear-encoded trnas need to be imported from the cytosol to compensate for those that are missing . in both gossypium genomes, four  of the  <dig> trnas are absent from the mitochondrial genome, and therefore must be imported from the cytosol. to evaluate the patterns of loss of trnas during the evolution of plant mitochondrial genomes, we analyzed trnas in  <dig> land plant mitochondrial genomes . of the genomes analyzed, only the non-seed plants marchantia polymorpha, pleurozia purpurea and treubia lacunose have a complete set of trnas. patterns of presence/absence suggest that trna was lost early in the evolution of seed plants, while trnl, trnr, trnt, and trnv were lost during the evolution of the eudicots. interestingly, trnv exists in both gossypium and b. vulgaris; however, these may both represent subsequent gains, as blast comparison of the trnv copy in gossypium shows more than 99 % identity to the corresponding copy in the gossypium chloroplast . similar to the observation for the eudicots, trng was lost early during monocot evolution. finally, s. latifolia and p. dactylifera experienced rapid loss of large numbers of trnas  <cit> . overall, only trnc, trne, trnm, trnp and trny are present in all species evaluated, indicating that these trnas may be most conserved in plant mitochondrial genomes.fig.  <dig> the loss of trnas in  <dig> plant mitochondrial genomes. the phylogenetic tree was constructed based on nucleotide sequences of  <dig> mitochondrial genes including nad <dig>  nad <dig>  nad <dig>  nad <dig>  nad4l, nad <dig>  nad <dig>  nad <dig>  cob, cox <dig>  cox <dig>  cox <dig>  atp <dig>  atp <dig>  atp <dig>  atp <dig> and atp <dig> using maximum likelihood  method with the model gtr + g + i in mega <dig>   <cit> . the amino acids at the nodes represent the corresponding trna gene losses from mitochondrial genomes, and the arrow stands for trna loss in s. latifolia




CONCLUSIONS
mitochondrial genomes of plants are evolutionarily intriguing because of their highly conserved genic content and slow rates of genic evolution , features which contrast sharply with their highly labile genomic structure, genome size, dna repair mechanisms and recombination induced by different types and origins of repeated sequences. common evolutionary modifications of mitochondrial genomes include gene loss  <cit> ; intracellular, intergenomic transfers  <cit> ; sequence acquisitions, horizontal transfers from other, sometimes distantly related species  <cit> ; multiple sequence rearrangements  <cit>  and dna repair mechanisms . here we compare the mitochondrial genomes of two closely related allopolyploid cotton species, which diverged only 1– <dig> mya and share the same organellar ancestry  <cit> . despite the short divergence time separating g. barbadense and g. hirsutum, many of the hallmark features of mitochondrial genome evolution are evident, including differential genic content, gains/losses of multiple small and large repeats, and genome rearrangements, horizontal transfer, and the evolution of duplicated genes. we illustrate how phylogenetic analysis combined with divergence data can illuminate the timing of duplicated gene formation and of differences in mitochondrial trna and protein coding gene content. increasing insight into the mechanisms and functional consequences of mitochondrial gene and genome variation are expected as additional plant mitochondrial genome sequences become available.
