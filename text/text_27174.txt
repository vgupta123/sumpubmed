BACKGROUND
thermal adaptation is a widespread phenomenon in organisms that are exposed to variable and extreme environments. while some organisms may alter their distribution or behavior to avoid stressors and others may acclimate through physiological plasticity  <cit> , many species evolve adaptive responses to local conditions over generations through natural selection  <cit> . evolutionary adaptation to local environments has been demonstrated across a wide variety of taxa  <cit> , and is expected to play a critical role for species with limited dispersal capabilities. however, few studies have identified the underlying molecular mechanisms that have led to conspecific adaptation to thermal conditions.

molecular techniques such as rna-seq  <cit>  provide the opportunity to investigate transcriptional response to thermal stress and further identify mechanisms for thermal adaptation. patterns of gene expression under heat stress are important to determining evolutionary adaptation among conspecific populations that occupy various environments. multiple genes have been shown to be involved in heat tolerance across many species, including highly conserved heat shock proteins  that are upregulated under stressful conditions such as exposure to heat  <cit> . an adaptive heat shock response has additionally been shown to occur among conspecific populations that occupy variable environments  <cit> . however, many genes are known to have a role in regulating the effects of temperature and are likely to be involved in thermal adaptation  <cit> . thus, rna-seq provides the opportunity to investigate differential expression across the transcriptome and identify biological pathways involved in evolutionary response to thermal stress.

redband trout  occupy highly variable environments including both montane and desert streams and have been shown to be locally adapted to these different environments  <cit> . previous research has demonstrated an adaptive heat shock response among populations from different climates but also suggests that additional mechanisms are involved with thermal adaptation  <cit> . this species appears to have evolved a finely tuned heat shock response that likely requires additional genes to balance the short term  and long term  costs associated with thermal stress. given that oxygen delivery is limiting for fish under climate-related stressors  <cit> , genes involved in oxygen transport are expected to play a significant role. additionally, we expect that metabolic and immune pathways could be involved given the energy demands and potential for disease under chronic environmental stress  <cit> . therefore, this study tests for molecular response to heat stress across the transcriptome of ecologically divergent populations of redband trout that have evolved under local climate regimes.

in this study, desert and montane strains of redband trout and their f <dig> crosses were tested for differential gene expression under heat stress in a common garden experiment. we tested for both acute and chronic stress response by quantifying gene expression in fish that experienced diel water temperatures similar to desert environments that peaked near their thermal maxima  over the course of four weeks. tissues were collected from each strain of redband trout at multiple time points  to test for both acclimatization within each strain and evolutionary adaptation between strains. results are quantified to confirm the role of hsp genes in these fish, but also identify additional genes and biological pathways that are regulated to balance the costs of stress response in populations that have evolved to desert environments.

RESULTS
sequence alignment to reference transcriptome
a total of  <dig> lanes for eight pooled libraries provided  <dig>  billion quality filtered reads over all  <dig> samples. read numbers ranged from  <dig> - <dig>  m per sample, with an overall mean of  <dig>  m . read numbers were well balanced between treatment and control groups with  <dig>  billion and  <dig>  billion reads, respectively. trimmed 60 bp reads were aligned with a minimum criterion of 95% identity to the reference transcriptome at an average of  <dig> % and  <dig>  m reads per sample. mean percent alignment and mean number of aligned reads for each set of biological replicates ranged from  <dig> - <dig> % and  <dig> - <dig>  m, respectively . reads aligned to a total of  <dig>  unique contigs from the reference transcriptome. the mean percentage of aligned reads was not high , but this experience is common for non-model species  <cit> . trade-offs exist between aligning rna-seq data to an existing reference transcriptome versus de-novo assembly  <cit> . we chose a conservative approach by aligning to a published reference transcriptome  <cit>  that was assembled from multiple types of tissues under stress response which should be more representative than de-novo alignment with a single tissue type.table  <dig>

principal component analyses of overall gene expression data clearly showed that samples clustered by treatment or control condition and also that distinct clusters were present for the desert and montane strains, but the cluster for the f <dig> strain overlapped with the montane strain .figure  <dig>

differential expression
differences in gene expression were highly significant within each strain , with  <dig>  significant genes for the desert strain ,  <dig>  for f <dig> crosses , and  <dig>  for montane . as expected, a large number of total transcripts  were differentially expressed in the study  with  <dig>  transcripts occurring in common among all three strains, but the desert strain had a larger number of unique differentially expressed transcripts  than the montane  or the f <dig>  strain . strongly differentiated genes  were highly abundant in the desert strain  relative to the other two strains , particularly in upregulated transcripts .figure  <dig>

differences in gene expression were also observed over time as the number of significant genes consistently decreased with more days of exposure to temperature stress . the number of significant genes was  <dig>  at day  <dig> ,  <dig>  at day  <dig> ,  <dig>  at day  <dig> , and  <dig>  at day  <dig> . this trend was consistent with the expectation that the stress response would become reduced with chronic exposure to heat stress.figure  <dig>

gene ontology and enrichment with blast2go revealed that strongly differentiated genes in each strain  included several categories for each of biological processes, molecular function, and cellular components . within biological process, there were a total of  <dig> pathway categories at level  <dig> gene ontology, but nearly 70% of the genes were included in five categories: cellular process , metabolic process , response to stimulus , single-organism process , and biological regulation . within molecular function, there were a total of  <dig> pathway categories at level  <dig> gene ontology with over 75% of the genes in two categories: binding , and catalytic activity . within cellular components, there were a total of  <dig> pathway categories at level  <dig> gene ontology, with over 80% of the genes included in four categories: cell , organelle , membrane , and macromolecular complex . finally, many of the genes that were found to be differentially expressed relative to control fish in all strains and time points were stress response genes such as various hsp transcripts.figure  <dig>

patterns of gene expression for each strain over time were compared with results from qpcr assays for heat shock genes and were highly consistent with either rna-seq or qpcr data . specifically, expression patterns showed that heat shock genes were significantly lower for the desert strain at day  <dig> for all hsp genes and all strains had decreased gene expression from day  <dig> through the remainder of the experiment as shown previously  <cit> .

discussion
since thermal stress has broad biological effects on organisms, transcriptional response is expected to be highly diverse across several genes in ectothermic species such as redband trout. this study confirms that numerous genes are differentially expressed in redband trout under heat stress, and several pathways are involved. however, there were key pathways that contained a large proportion of differentially expressed transcripts including response to stimulus, metabolic processes, cellular processes, molecular binding function, and cell membrane function. these pathways correspond well with previous studies that demonstrate these as critical physiological components involved with of aquatic ectotherms exposed to elevated water temperatures  <cit> . in particular, several physiological studies have linked thermal tolerance with aerobic scope and emphasize the role of metabolic processes in thermal adaptation . the larger number of differentially expressed genes in the desert strain versus the other two strains suggests that a complex combination of genes has evolved for redband trout in their desert environment. it is also possible that a few genes with large pleiotropic effects could be responsible for the pattern observed.

evidence for acclimation to heat stress was extensive as the number of differentially expressed transcripts decreased by  <dig> % from day  <dig> to day  <dig>  results from this study elaborate on previous findings in redband trout that stress response genes are highly upregulated when exposed to heat stress  <cit> . multiple heat shock genes  were differentially expressed in all strains and time periods. however, an acclimation effect was evident as expression levels decreased over time in all strains. this is consistent with theories of acclimation to heat stress where organisms are able to moderate their heat shock response over time, as opposed to initial exposure where immediate survival is a priority  <cit> . however, the current results demonstrate that acclimation within strains occurs throughout much of the transcriptome and is not limited to heat shock genes.

more importantly, this study demonstrates that adaptive patterns of expression have evolved in ecologically divergent populations of this species. results from narum et al.  <cit>  specifically highlight the adaptive response of heat shock genes in redband trout, with lower hsp gene expression observed in desert versus montane strains. results in heat shock genes from the current rna-seq data corroborate the previous qpcr results and emphasize that warm adapted natural populations are likely to have evolved a specialized heat shock response that reduces physiological costs of hsp production. this result is consistent with the adaptive heat shock response observed in natural populations of other organisms such as killifish  and drosophila buzzatii  <cit> . this remains an important finding of this study and provides clarification regarding evolutionary adaptation of hsp gene expression in heat tolerant populations. however, many recent studies indicate that complex mechanisms are involved in thermal adaptation of aquatic ectotherms beyond heat shock response  and the effects of climate change are expected to further alter species’ range, phenology, and persistence  <cit> . genomic and physiological mechanisms for thermal adaptation can be important tools for conservation measures to enable long-term viability of wild populations  <cit> . specifically, this study helps to further identify genomic tools such as genetic screening with candidate genes that may be integrated with measurements of cardiac function  <cit>  in order to screen broadly across species’ range to predict the potential for adaptation under scenarios of climate change  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates that redband trout from a desert climate have a much larger number of strongly differentially expressed genes than montane and f <dig> strains in response to heat stress, suggesting that a combination of genes has evolved for redband trout to adapt in their desert environment. recent studies of physiological adaptation in aquatic ectotherms indicate that intraspecific thermal tolerance is set by limitations in aerobic performance, specifically the upper limit of heart rate to deliver oxygen to tissues . this is due to temperature dependent oxygen limitation in aquatic environments, a theory that has been well supported in many organisms  <cit> . in order to support this increase in cardiac performance, redband trout would need to differentially regulate genes from multiple pathways including those observed in this study . however, further studies that specifically link individual gene expression  <cit>  with physiological functions such as aerobic scope and heart rate are needed to further elucidate the specific mechanisms involved with thermal adaptation in this species. development of a reference transcriptome and genome that are more specific to this subspecies of o. mykiss would also provide better annotation of genomic architecture of various traits such as thermal adaptation.
