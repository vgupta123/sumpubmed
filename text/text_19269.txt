BACKGROUND
bisdioxopiperazines, including icrf- <dig>  razoxane ; icrf- <dig> and icrf-187), two stereo-isomers of raz, and icrf- <dig>  developed in the uk, were some of the earliest agents found against a murine spontaneous metastatic model  in  <dig>  <cit> . many papers and projects have dealt with their potential use and mechanisms since that time. three main mechanisms of bisdioxopiperazine action have been investigated, including assisting in radiotherapy,  <cit>  overcoming multi-drug resistance  of daunorubicin and doxorubicin to leukemias  <cit>  and inhibiting topoisomerase ii  <cit> . more importantly, raz has been licensed for cardioprotectant of anticancer anthrocyclines in more countries. since bisdioxopiperazines represents a unique family of antimetastatic agents that are structurally conservative in their pharmacological actions, two new derivatives, probimane  and mst- <dig>   <dig>  2- bis  ethane were synthesized at this institute in shanghai, china.  <cit> . apart from data of anti-tumor activity  <cit> , the pharmacological mechanisms of pro as raz, like the detoxication of adriamycin , induced cardiotoxicities and synergism with adr against leukemias were reported at henan academy of medicine, henan, china  <cit> . as the main researchers of pro, we reported some novel biological actions of pro, including the inhibition of the activity of calmodulin , a cell-signal regulator, which can explain anticancer actions and the combined cytotoxic effect of pro with adr  <cit>  inhibiting lipoperoxidation  of erythrocytes  <cit> , down-regulating sialic acid synthesis in tumors  <cit>  and blocking the binding of fibrinogen to leukemia cells  <cit> . mst- <dig>  as a licensed drug in japan since  <dig>  was permitted for direct use in leukemia chemotherapy, mainly against adult t-cell leukemia treatment  <cit> . structural formulae of the three bisdioxopiperazines are represented in figure  <dig> 

as a new bisdioxopiperazine, the pharmacological characters and features of pro are intriguing. increased understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of the two compounds is a first step for promoting applications of pro and mst- <dig>  therefore, in depth pharmacological evaluation was carried out. tumors studied are from  <dig> different organs of origin – two gastric tumor cell line , a lung tumor cell line , a colon cancer cell line , two mammary tumor cell lines , one hepatic tumor cell line , two leukemia cell line  and an uteric cervical tumor cell line . in addition, time- and concentration-dependent relations to classify the effectiveness of different therapeutic schedules and schemes of pro and mst- <dig> therapy have been addressed.

RESULTS
cytotoxic effects of pro and mst- <dig> against human tumor cell lines
data on the anticancer effects of pro using  <dig> human tumor cell lines in vitro are showed in figure  <dig> and table  <dig>  pro had anticancer effects in vitro at clinical acceptable concentrations  by mtt methods. the ic <dig> values of pro are  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm representing tumor cells of scg- <dig> and mkn-  <dig> , hct- <dig> , mda-mb- <dig> and mda-mb- <dig> , a <dig>  and hl <dig> and k <dig> , bel- <dig>  and hela cell  respectively . among these tumor cell lines, pro is more effective to scg- <dig> , a <dig>  and hl <dig> and k <dig> , the ic <dig> values being ≤ <dig> μm.

comparison of the cytotoxic effects of bisdioxopiperazines with other drugs
the cytotoxic effects against tumor cell lines  are included in table  <dig>  although ic50s of dox, vcr and 5-fu are lower than that of pro, the greatest inhibitory rates of pro at high concentrations are seen . no inhibitory difference between low and high concentrations of dox, vcr and 5-fu was observed . generally, the ld <dig> of vcr and dox in experimental animals and humans are dramatically lower than pro. these results suggest more difficult management and wider toxicities of these drugs in their application in the clinics, suggesting pro may avoid these drawbacks.

comparison of anti-tumor effects of probimane and mst- <dig> and their time- response relationships
cytotoxic effects  of probimane and mst- <dig> against tumor cells were compared .

in addition, the time- response curves indicate that the anti-tumor effects of pro increase to a climax over  <dig> days of drug exposure . the cytotoxic effects of pro persist or rise with time, whereas those of vcr, dox and 5-fu decrease after  <dig> h . ic <dig> of both pro and mst- <dig> reduces dramatically by  <dig> h from  <dig> h. . the reductions of ic <dig> for both agents pro or mst- <dig> depend on the cell line. ic <dig> ratios of pro and mst- <dig> for  <dig> days relative to  <dig> days against the most metastatic phenotype tumor cell line mda-mb- <dig>  are  <dig>  and  <dig>  times higher, and  <dig>  times for the medium metastatic phenotype of mda-mb- <dig> cells.

g <dig> and m phase arrests induced by pro or mst-16
our data shows that both probimane  and mst- <dig> can arrest tumor cells in g <dig> and m phases of the cell cycle. dose- and/ or concentration- dependency are observed in g <dig> and m arrests , and the arresting effect of pro on mda-mb- <dig> and hct- <dig> is only  <dig> times higher for mst- <dig> at equivalent concentrations. pro at  <dig> μm can increase g2/m accumulation from  <dig>  %  to  <dig>  % after  <dig> h .

chromosome segregation inhibition by pro and mst-16
chromosome linkages, aggregations and segregation in tumor cells were blocked by both pro and mst- <dig>  figure  <dig> and  <dig> show linkages and segregation blockade of chromosomes in cells treated with pro and mst- <dig> at  <dig> μm. despite this, chromosomes began to separate with each other, and their morphology became slimmer at lower concentration 1μm in both human mammary tumors of mda-mb- <dig> cells and mda-mb- <dig> cell lines in vitro. this chromosome poisoning action of pro, mst- <dig> and icrf- <dig> was seen at 1-  <dig> μm. in vehicle control group, chromosomes of tumor cells separated from each other very well. although we only show typically one or two cells, the chromosomal characteristics in each group have an overall consistency  in each piece of preparation from cell treated with pro, mst- <dig> and icrf- <dig>  they are common characteristics and phenotypes induced by the three compounds. in addition, there seems no difference in overall chromosome effects of pro and mst- <dig> at equivalent concentrations , suggests that pro and mst- <dig> act equally in this pathway.

discussion
increased understanding over the mechanisms of bisdioxopopiperazines can greatly improve their indications and narrow down contraindicates in clinical practice. the explanations for the anticancer actions of bisdioxopiperazine are currently focusing on anti-angiogeneses  <cit>  and tumor cell dna alterations caused by topoisomerase ii. generally speaking, most angiogenesis inhibitors often have low cytotoxicity and are ineffective against larger tumor masses, and are better combined with cytotoxic drugs clinically  <cit> . this work on the anticancer activity of pro and mst- <dig> shows that they act through the blocking of chromosomal segregation and g2/m phase arrests, causing complete inhibition of tumor cell division. pro, mst- <dig> and icrf- <dig> play similar roles at equi-molar concentrations. this pathway may be related to topoismerase ii inhibition  <cit>  as a possible mode of tumor growth inhibition, but is not suggested as a systematic approach through a cascade series. two findings in this study need further discussion;  the effective ranges of pro and mst- <dig> in the blocking of chromosome segregation, and causing g2/m phase arrests are 1-  <dig> μm, similar for pro and mst- <dig>  this suggests the two processes operate in the same course or cascade, and most possibly are directly linked;  cyto-toxicity test  showed that pro was more effective than mst- <dig>  lacking parallels in the effective dose ranges of pro and mst- <dig> between cyto-toxicities and chromosome segregation – induced tumor inhibition can be explained by the fact that these effects of pro and mst- <dig> do not strictly follow the same pathway given in figure  <dig>  stronger cytotoxic effects of pro against many other human tumor cell lines than original bisdioxopiperazines derivatives, especially on solid tumors, suggest some as yet undiscovered mechanism that pro may have, and pro may have better applications and require fewer drug combinations in the future.

this work shows that anticancer activities of pro against lung cancer and leukemia are relatively greater than against other tumor typies. cytotoxic and antimetastatic activities of pro against lung tumor models in vivo have also been found  <cit> . lung cancer is the most prevalent among all cancer categories, and is one of the deadliest cancers in the clinics. targeted at lung cancers, pro may offer better medical and economic benefits in the future.

for clinical chemotherapy, the paramount task is the balancing between treatment outcome and risks  <cit> . to optimize chemotherapeutic protocols containing bisdioxopiperazines, knowledge of its pharmacological parameters in terms of concentration- and time- responses are prerequisites. we found that pro and mst- <dig> might act and accumulate longer in tumor cells than most of anticancer drugs. the peak of cytotoxicity of both pro and mst- <dig> is on day  <dig>  and not usually on day  <dig>  this result and our early work of auto-radiography that pro  <cit>  persists longer in tumor tissues suggest that longer intervals may be used between treatments and less nursing responsibilities may arise, while maintaining high levels of tumor growth inhibitions. the long- term cytotoxic effects of pro and mst- <dig> are more obvious in high metastatic tumor cell lines, which can explain the selective effects of compounds to tumor metastases. early reports suggest that mst- <dig> needs to transform into icrf- <dig> to exhibit its anticancer effects  <cit> . this work proves that mst- <dig> does not degraded to icrf- <dig>  and has a lower cytotoxic effects against tumor cells than pro. yet mst- <dig> can maintain a high activity in the cascade of the proposed mechanism – chromosome segregation blockage and cellular g2/m phase arrest, leading to inhibition of cell division . it further suggests this mechanism is not a pivotal pathway for cytotoxic activity against tumors.

CONCLUSIONS
we suggest that pro has a wider spectrum of cytotoxic effects against human tumor cells than other bisdioxopiperazines, especially on solid tumors. the cytotoxic pathway of pro and mst- <dig> appears to be through chromosome segregation blocking and g2/ m phase arrests. pro may be more potent than mst- <dig>  high dose- and time- related responses of pro than vcr, 5-fu and dox are seen that suggest a selectivity by pro against tumor growth. it suggests that the family of bisdioxopiperazines may sustain their cytotoxic effects longer than other anticancer drugs.
