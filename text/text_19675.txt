BACKGROUND
about 90% of terrestrial plant species, including major crops such as rice, soybean, barley and wheat, assimilate co <dig> via the c <dig> pathway of photosynthesis. ribulose- <dig> -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase  acts as the primary co2-fixing enzyme of c <dig> photosynthesis, but its ability to use o <dig> as a substrate instead of co <dig> results in the energy-wasting process of photorespiration. the photosynthetic c <dig> cycle represents an addition to the c <dig> pathway which acts as a pump that accumulates co <dig> at the site of rubisco so that the oxygenase activity of the enzyme is inhibited and photorespiration is largely suppressed. c <dig> plants therefore achieve higher photosynthetic capacities and better water- and nitrogen-use efficiencies when compared with c <dig> species  <cit> .

c <dig> photosynthesis is characterized by the coordinated division of labour between two morphologically distinct cell types, the mesophyll and the bundle-sheath cells. the correct functioning of the c <dig> cycle depends upon the strict compartmentalization of the co <dig> assimilatory enzymes into either mesophyll or bundle-sheath cells  <cit> . phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase , which serves as the actual co <dig> pump of the c <dig> pathway, is specifically expressed in the mesophyll cells of c <dig> leaves. this enzyme is not an unique feature of c <dig> species; other pepc isoforms with different catalytic and regulatory properties are found in both photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic tissues of all plants where they participate in a variety of metabolic processes, e.g. replenishment of citric acid cycle intermediates and regulation of guard cell movement  <cit> .

the polyphyletic origin of c <dig> photosynthesis suggests that the photosynthetic c <dig> isoforms of pepc have evolved independently several times from non-photosynthetic c <dig> isozymes  <cit> . during the evolution of c <dig> pepc genes from ancestral c <dig> genes, changes in expression strength and organ- and cell-specific expression patterns must have occurred. while c <dig> pepc genes are highly expressed in the mesophyll cells of the leaf, the c <dig> isoform genes are only moderately transcribed in all plant organs  <cit> .

to investigate the molecular evolution of a c <dig> pepc gene we are using the genus flaveria  as a model system. this genus includes c <dig> and c <dig> as well as c3–c <dig> intermediate species  <cit>  and thus provides an excellent system for studying the evolution of the c <dig> photosynthetic pathway  <cit> . previous studies on the ppca <dig> gene of f. trinervia, encoding the c <dig> isoform of pepc, revealed that the strong mesophyll-specific expression is largely regulated at the transcriptional level and that the available  <dig> bp  of the 5' flanking sequences contain all the essential cis-regulatory elements for high and mesophyll-specific expression  <cit> . two parts of the ppca <dig> promoter of f. trinervia, a proximal region  up to - <dig> in combination with a distal region  from - <dig> to - <dig>  are sufficient to direct a high mesophyll-specific expression of a β-glucuronidase  reporter gene in transgenic f. bidentis  plants  <cit> . the orthologous,  <dig> bp comprising ppca <dig> promoter of the c <dig> species f. pringlei displays only weak activity in all interior leaf tissues in transgenic f. bidentis, but fusion of the c4-dr to this c <dig> pepc promoter leads to a confinement of gus expression to the mesophyll  <cit> . analysis of the c4-dr revealed that the 41-bp module mem <dig>  is responsible for the c4-characteristic spatial expression pattern of the ppca <dig> gene of f. trinervia. furthermore, it was shown that a high level of expression in the mesophyll requires an interaction of the c4-dr with the c4-pr. this suggests that quantity elements for an elevated expression of the c <dig> pepc gene are located within the pr of the 5' flanking sequences  <cit> .

using the yeast one-hybrid system, windhövel and colleagues  <cit>  identified four different proteins which bind to the pr of the ppca <dig> promoter of f. trinervia, but not to the corresponding part of the ppca <dig> promoter of f. pringlei. these proteins  belong to the class of zinc finger homeodomain proteins . two regions of the c4-pr specifically interact with the fthb proteins in vitro: an intron sequence within the 5' untranslated leader region and a dna fragment that is located upstream of the putative tata-box. to the latter one, the fthb proteins showed a much lower binding affinity  <cit> . homeobox proteins are known to act as transcriptional regulators of eukaryotic gene expression  <cit> , and the fact that the fthb homeobox proteins interact specifically with the pr of the ppca <dig> promoter of f. trinervia makes them prime candidates for transcription factors that are involved in the establishment of the c4-characteristic expression pattern of the c <dig> ppca <dig> gene.

in this study we have investigated the role of the proximal promoter region of the ppca <dig> gene of f. trinvervia with regard to its high and mesophyll-specific expression by transgenic analyses in the closely related c <dig> species f. bidentis. we demonstrate that the proximal promoter region of the ppca <dig> gene contains cis-regulatory elements that determine promoter strength. furthermore, we show that the deletion of an intron located in the 5' untranslated segment of ppca <dig> does not alter promoter activity in transgenic f. bidentis.

RESULTS
experimental strategy
we are interested in elucidating the molecular events that are crucial for the evolution of the high and mesophyll-specific expression of the c <dig> phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase gene  of the c <dig> plant f. trinervia. in this study we focus on the proximal promoter region  of the ppca <dig> gene with respect to its function in establishing the c4-characteristic expression pattern. we performed a comparative analysis of three different promoter-gus fusion constructs  in transgenic f. bidentis plants. f. bidentis is a close relative to f. trinervia, but in contrast to f. trinervia this c <dig> species is transformable by agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated gene transfer  <cit>  and was therefore chosen for these experiments.

construct ppca-prft-drft served as a reference because it was already known from previous experiments that a combination of the distal  and the proximal  promoter regions was sufficient to direct a high and mesophyll specific expression of a gus reporter gene in f. bidentis  <cit> . to find out if the pr of the c <dig> ppca <dig> promoter contains quantity elements conferring high expression in the mesophyll cells we designed construct ppca-prfp-drft. here, the c4-pr was exchanged for its counterpart from the orthologous ppca <dig> gene of the c <dig> species f. pringlei. deletion of the intron sequences in the 5' untranslated segment of promoter construct ppca-prft-drft resulted in the formation of construct ppca-prftΔintron-drft. thereby a putative binding site for the zf-hd proteins fthb <dig> to fthb <dig>  <cit>  was removed from the c4-pr. hence, this chimeric promoter-gus fusion could answer the question whether the intron-located putative binding site of the fthb proteins is necessary for the establishment of the c4-specific ppca <dig> expression pattern.

the proximal region of the ppca <dig> promoter of f. trinervia harbours cis-regulatory elements for a high level of pepc expression in the mesophyll
gowik et al.  <cit>  assumed that the pr of the ppca <dig> promoter of f. trinervia comprises cis-regulatory determinants conferring high levels of expression in mesophyll cells of c <dig> leaves. to examine whether the pr actually harbours such quantity elements we analyzed the gus expression patterns of constructs ppca-prft-drft and ppca-prfp-drft  in transgenic f. bidentis.

in f. bidentis plants that had been transformed with promoter construct ppca-prft-drft, gus expression was exclusively detected in the mesophyll cells of the leaves . this observation shows that the dr and pr of the ppca <dig> promoter together are sufficient for a high and mesophyll-specific expression of the linked gus reporter gene and therefore confirms the results obtained by gowik et al.  <cit> . replacement of the c4-pr by the corresponding region from the ppca <dig> promoter of f. pringlei ft) did not cause any alteration in the cellular gus expression pattern when compared to ppca-prft-drft; gus activity was still restricted to the mesophyll compartment . however, both chimeric promoters differed greatly in transcriptional strength. quantitative gus assays revealed that promoter activity was decreased by a factor of  <dig> when the c4-pr was substituted for the c3-pr . this clearly demonstrated that the c4-characteristic transcription-enhancing cis-regulatory elements must be located within the proximal region of the ppca <dig> promoter of f. trinervia. the low expression level of construct ppca-prfp-drft could be the result of an absence of transcription-enhancing cis-regulatory elements in the c3-pr, but it might also be caused by problems in the interaction of the c4-dr and the c3-pr.

the intron in the c4-pr is not required for the establishment of a c4-specific expression pattern of the ppca <dig> gene of f. trinervia
the 5' untranslated region of the ppca <dig> gene of f. trinervia contains an intron between positions - <dig> and - <dig> . introns are of prominent importance for the molecular evolution of eukaryotic genomes by facilitating the generation of new genes via exon-shuffling and by providing the possibility to create multiple proteins from a single gene via alternative splicing  <cit> . furthermore, it has been shown that introns can affect many different stages of gene expression, including both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms  <cit> .

here, we wanted to investigate whether the first intron of the ppca <dig> gene of f. trinervia is essential for establishing the c4-characteristic expression pattern. we therefore deleted the intron sequences from the c4-pr in construct ppca-prfp-drft, resulting in the formation of construct ppca-prftΔintron-drft . the histochemical analysis of transgenic f. bidentis plants demonstrated that the ppca-prftΔintron-drftpromoter was exclusively active in the mesophyll cells of the leaves . the quantitative examination of gus activity  also revealed no significant differences between ppca-prftΔintron-drft ) and ppca-prft-drft ). these data suggest that the 5' located intron of ppca <dig> does not contain any cis-regulatory elements that are essential for achieving high mesophyll-specific expression of a reporter gene. accordingly, the specific binding of the fthb proteins to this intron that was observed in vitro and in yeast one-hybrid experiments  <cit>  has no in planta relevance concerning the regulation of ppca <dig> expression in c <dig> leaves. however, our results do not necessarily indicate that the intron is completely dispensable for the regulation of ppca <dig> gene expression. it is known that c <dig> gene transcription is modulated by various metabolites such as sugar hexoses  <cit> , and we cannot exclude that the first intron of the ppca <dig> gene of f. trinervia might be involved in the metabolic control of gene expression.

comparison of proximal ppca promoter sequences from different flaveria species
as reported above, cis-regulatory elements for leaf-specific enhanced transcription of the ppca <dig> gene of f. trinervia could be allocated to the pr of the 5' flanking sequences, but their exact nature and localization was still unclear. to identify potential cis-regulatory enhancing elements, a sequence comparison between the pr of the ppca <dig> gene of f. trinervia and equivalent promoter sequences from other flaveria species was performed . this approach was chosen because it was already known from northern analyses of ppca transcript levels in different flaveria species that ppca rna amounts in leaves increase gradually from c <dig> to c <dig> species  <cit> . this is consistent with the important function of pepc during c <dig> photosynthesis. the c4-like species f. brownii and f. vaginata exhibited ppca rna levels that were comparable to those of the c <dig> plants f. bidentis and f. trinervia, and even in f. pubescens, a c3–c <dig> intermediate with rather poorly developed c4-characteristic traits, ppca transcript accumulation in the leaves was significantly higher than in the c <dig> species f. cronquistii and f. pringlei  <cit> .

searching for known plant cis-regulatory dna elements in the place database  <cit>  resulted in the identification of two distinct sequence motifs which might be involved in the regulation of ppca expression levels . both of them, a putative myb transcription factor binding site  and a ccaat box  <cit> , are present in all examined c3–c <dig>  c4-like and c <dig> species, but are missing in the two c <dig> species . thus, these sequences are prime candidates for transcription-enhancing cis-regulatory elements. ccaat boxes are common sequences that are found in the 5' untranslated regions of many eukaryotic genes  <cit> . they are able to regulate the initiation of transcription by an interaction of ccaat-binding transcription factors with the basal transcription initiation complex  <cit> . there is no unifying expression pattern for plant genes containing putative ccaat promoter elements, indicating that they may play a complex role in regulating plant gene transcription  <cit> . myb proteins, on the other hand, comprise one of the largest families of transcription factors in plants, with almost  <dig> different myb genes present in the arabidopsis genome  <cit> . to test the physiological importance of the putative myb and ccaat binding sites  it will be crucial to inactivate these sequences in construct ppca-prftΔintron-drft by site-directed mutagenesis and to investigate whether this results in a decrease of reporter gene expression in the leaves of transgenic f. bidentis plants.

when searching for quantity elements in the pr of the ppca <dig> promoter of f. trinervia, one should always keep in mind that high levels of reporter gene expression in the leaf mesophyll require the synergistic action of the distal and proximal promoter regions. the c4-pr alone exhibits very low transcriptional activity in all interior leaf cell types of transgenic f. bidentis  <cit> , indicating that the cis-regulatory elements for enhanced expression are only functional when the c4-pr is combined with the cognate c4-dr. one may speculate that a strong expression of the ppca <dig> gene in the mesophyll cells of f. trinervia depends on the interaction of trans-acting factors which bind to cis-regulatory elements within the pr with other transcription factors that are recruited to c4-specific cis-regulatory determinants in the dr. in the future, further dissection of the c4-pr of f. trinervia and expression analyses of additional dr-pr combinations from ppca promoters of different flaveria species in transgenic f. bidentis will be useful for uncovering the control of ppca expression levels in c <dig> leaves.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have demonstrated that the proximal region  of the ppca <dig> promoter of f. trinervia  harbours cis-regulatory elements conferring high expression levels in leaf mesophyll cells of transgenic f. bidentis . it was further demonstrated that the deletion of an intron in the 5' untranslated leader region does not affect the c4-specific ppca <dig> expression pattern and strength, indicating that the previously isolated zinc finger-homeobox transcription factors that specifically interact with this intron in vitro are not involved in regulating ppca <dig> expression levels. sequence comparisons resulted in the identification of potential cis-regulatory elements in the proximal part of the ppca <dig> promoter that might play a role in controlling ppca <dig> expression quantity. genetic manipulation of these sequences and subsequent analyses in transgenic f. bidentis will clarify whether they are able to direct high ppca <dig> expression levels in c <dig> leaves.
