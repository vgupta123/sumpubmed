BACKGROUND
calcium is one of the most important metals for life. calcium-binding sites in proteins play a wide range of roles including stabilizing protein structures or acting as cofactors in catalytic and regulatory processes <cit> . the most common configuration of calcium-binding sites is the ef-hand motif. other types of calcium-binding sites show great variation in coordinating residues, sizes and structural motifs. predicting and identifying calcium-binding sites in proteins are essential for understanding the roles of calcium in biological systems. unfortunately, there are no universally applicable sequence motifs for calcium binding, and so they are best recognized with structure-based methods <cit> .

existing methods for binding sites recognition can be classified into four types:  homology based annotation transfer methods  geometric methods,  energetic methods, and  methods using other criteria, including the characteristic distribution of chemical properties, the 3d motif, the surface accessibility, and the stability of proteins <cit> . we have previously presented a knowledge-based method, feature, which calculates physical and chemical properties in concentric shells around a potential binding site, with a bayesian score to predict its likelihood of ligand binding <cit> . feature has been applied to predict sites such as calcium-binding, zinc-binding, atp-binding and others <cit> . one advantage of feature is its sequence independence and thus it is able to recognize divergent binding sites based on the three-dimensional configuration of atoms in these sites.

feature has been applied to both static crystal structures as well as to multiple conformations generated by short  molecular dynamics simulations <cit> . feature has better performance in identifying calcium-binding sites when it is applied to multiple configurations produced by dynamic simulations. these results underscore the dynamic properties of many ligand-binding sites, including calcium. indeed, residues that coordinate a metal often undergo conformational changes upon binding <cit> . calcium binding often results in conformational changes and an increase in the stability of proteins  file as "unstructured" regions. more than 2/ <dig> of the crystal structures in the pdb contain unstructured regions <cit> . this frustrates the recognition of ligand-binding sites by methods, which depend on a 3d structure.

in this study, we combine previously published loop modeling methods with feature to predict calcium-binding sites in unstructured regions for which there is no crystallographic electron density  <cit> . the loop building and calcium recognition codes have both been validated separately. the contribution of this paper is to combine them and show useful results in recovering calcium binding sites in loops as long as  <dig> residues. we first validate the method by testing its performance on a set of calcium binding sites for which there is both a holo structure  and an apo structure  available in the pdb. many of the calcium-binding loops in the crystallographic apo structures do not adopt recognizable calcium-binding configurations. however, when we rebuild them, the calcium binding sites become clear. we then go on to predict calcium binding in a set of rebuilt loops. we predict calcium-binding sites that achieve high feature scores and further characterize these novel predictions, a subset of which we can validate using the literature.

RESULTS
feature scan of validation dataset
we are specifically targeting calcium ions that are coordinated by atoms in the protein structure and are not on the surface mediated by water. we anticipate that sites mediated by protein atoms are more likely to be specific. it would be interesting and significantly more challenging to predict calcium sites whose binding is mediated in large part by water molecules. using the  <dig> sites published in babor's work we derived a dataset of positive sites contains  <dig> calcium-binding loops of which structures of loop regions in both the apo and the holo forms have been resolved using x-ray diffraction  <cit> .

pdb id  and protein names are from pdb . pdb id and chain id are from pdb . the rmsd between the apo and the holo structures is given in column  <dig>  columns  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> list the information of calcium-binding loops, including the loop starting and ending residue numbers, and the loop sequence. the rmsd between calcium-binding loops in the apo and the holo structures is given in column  <dig> 

we compare the performance of feature on the holo structures, the apo structures, the apo structures of which the binding loops were removed , and the apo structures of which the binding loops  have been rebuilt using modeling methods. protein and calcium id are from pdb . feature scores that evaluate the probability of the likelihood of a site being calcium-binging are listed in column 2- <dig>  of the  <dig> pairs,  <dig> apo-loops have higher feature scores than the corresponding apo structures. bolded number indicates that feature identifies the calcium-binding site correctly using a score threshold of  <dig>  feature identifies  <dig> out of  <dig> calcium-binding sites in the holo structures. combined with modeling methods, feature identifies  <dig> out of  <dig> calcium-binding sites in the apo-loops. for comparison, feature identifies binding sites correctly in only  <dig> out of  <dig> the apo structures, and  <dig> out of  <dig> the apo-gaps. these results demonstrate that reconstruction of the calcium-binding loops in the apo structures allows feature to identify cryptic calcium sites effectively.

these results demonstrate that reconstruction  of the calcium-binding loops in the apo structures allows feature to identify cryptic calcium sites effectively.

as a negative control, we created a dataset of nonsites using the  <dig> pairs of apo and holo structures. the negative control contains a set of random selected loops  in the holo structures and the counterpart in the apo structures. the local environments surrounding nonsites never achieves scores compatible with calcium binding. the score of rebuilt loops  ranges from - <dig>  to  <dig> , indicating that the score cutoff of  <dig> is, indeed, highly specific   <cit> .

in summary, applying feature and modeling methods to the  <dig> apo-holo pairs of calcium-binding proteins demonstrates that our procedure can identify calcium-binding sites successfully even when structures of binding-loops are not well structured, and gives us confidence to make novel predictions. importantly, these predictions have a low positives  likelihood of being false, based on both our previous validations and our tests on these  <dig> pairs. we thus are confident that we can seek novel calcium binding sites.

predict calcium-binding sites in proteins of which structures of the binding loops have not been resolved experimentally
we scanned all proteins that share scop folds families with known calcium-binding proteins. the candidate dataset consisting of  <dig> pdb chains containing  <dig> structural gaps. we built structures for the  <dig> gaps using modeling methods. feature predicts calcium binding in the loop structures for  <dig> of these gaps, from which  <dig> non-redundant predictions were derived. these  <dig> predictions were further divided into three groups  according to the availability of experimental evidence: direct evidence in the literature, indirect evidence from similar known calcium-binding proteins, and truly novel predictions.

two predictions of which calcium binding have been observed experimentally near the predicted sites. column  <dig> lists protein name that is pdb code followed by the chain identifier. we build structures for gaps of which 3d structures are not presented in the original pdb files. information of these structures, referred as "loop", is given in column 3- <dig>  column  <dig> lists the distances between the predicted sites and the experimentally observed sites . column  <dig> and  <dig> list feature scores at the predicted sites in the structures where loop structures are missing  and the structures of which loop structures were rebuilt by modeling methods . these two are holo structures, but their calcium-binding sites are not completely structured. feature is able to identify these sites in the presence of the rebuilt loop structures.

column  <dig> lists protein name that is pdb code followed by the chain identifier. we build structures for gaps of which 3d structures are not present in the original pdb files. information of these structures, referred as "loop", is given in column 2- <dig>  column  <dig> lists the distances from the predicted sites to the rebuilt loops . column  <dig> and  <dig> list feature scores at the predicted sites in the structures where loop structures are missing  and in the rebuilt loop structures . ligands observed experimentally are listed in column  <dig> and the ligand ids are from pdb. column  <dig> shows the scop id of the holo structures. information of aligned counterparts for the binding loops is listed in column 10- <dig>  column  <dig> lists the distances from the calcium ions to the aligned loop counterparts . the percentage of residues aligned , the rmsd of the aligned regions, and the percentage of identical residues  are shown in column 13- <dig> 

column  <dig> lists pdb code followed by the chain identifier. we build structures for gaps of which 3d structures are not present in the original pdb files. information of these structures, referred as "loop", is given in column 2- <dig>  column  <dig> lists the distances from the predicted sites to the rebuilt loops . column  <dig> and  <dig> list feature scores at the predicted sites in the structures where loop structures are missing  and in the rebuilt loop structures . ligands observed experimentally are listed in column  <dig> and the ligand ids are from pdb. column  <dig> shows the scop id of the homologous holo structures. information of aligned counterparts for the binding loops is listed in column 10- <dig>  column  <dig> lists the distances from the calcium ions to the aligned loop counterparts . the percentage of residues aligned , the rmsd of the aligned regions, and the percentage of identical residues  are shown in column 14- <dig> 

we have found direct experimental verifications for ten  of the  <dig> non-redundant predictions . table  <dig> shows the two predictions in which calcium binding have already been observed experimentally near our predicted sites. they are 1nqg chain a residues 231- <dig> and 1dhk chain b residues 89- <dig>  in these two proteins, partial 3d structures for the predicted sites are available. after rebuilding the binding sites using modeling methods, feature identifies these two sites. table  <dig> shows eight predictions of which their holo structures have been identified through a homologous searching process by using program mammoth <cit> . the structural homologs of the eight predictions satisfy three conditions:  the percentage of residue aligned  of the structural alignments between the prediction and the corresponding homologous structures is higher than 95%,  the percentage of identical residues  is higher than 85%  and  the distances between the calcium-binding loop in the homologous counterpart and calcium ions  is shorter than  <dig>  Å. these matched homologous structures are essentially holo structures for our targets. interestingly, in some cases, the loop does not directly interact with the calcium ion, but residues in the loop contribute to the feature score. for example, the last row in table  <dig>  the minimum distance between the  predicted site to the loop  is  <dig>  Å. the predicted site directly coordinates with d <dig>  d <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig>  the residue k <dig> actually provides positive balance charges for the sites. the coordination of the predicted site in 1faj is the same as that in the holo structures 1i <dig> 

another example  is the apo structure of concanavalin a from canavalia ensiformis , of which loop 15- <dig>  is unstructured <cit> . a blind scan for calcium-binding sites in 1apn failed because loop 15- <dig> is unstructured. however, feature identifies this calcium-binding site correctly when the structure of loop 15- <dig> is rebuilt using modeling methods. searching for homologs, we found that the calcium-binding form concanavalin a has been resolved experimentally   <cit> . in the structure of 1val, four residues 10d, 14n, 19d and 24h coordinate a calcium ion and a manganese ion, but residue 19d cannot be located in the initial apo structure . the close-up view shows that the predicted site is similar with the calcium-binding site in 1val identified experimentally. the comparison also suggests that more than one metal ions bind to the predicted site.

the predictions in table  <dig> and  <dig>  figure  <dig> and figure  <dig> show the rediscovery of calcium-binding sites and they demonstrate our method's effectiveness.

we have also found indirect experimental verifications for  <dig>  of the  <dig> non-redundant predictions. table  <dig> shows the  <dig> predictions for which homologous holo structures have been identified . the structural homologs of the  <dig> predictions satisfy two conditions:  the pra of the structural alignments between the prediction and the corresponding homologous structures is higher than 80% and  the cadis is shorter than  <dig>  Å. further visual inspection confirms that the manner of calcium binding in the structural homologs and that in the predicted sites is similar.

a structural homolog of 1gih is the structure of rat tao <dig>  in complex with mgatp . the pra between 1gih and 1u5r is 81%. 1gih and 1u5r both possess a typical protein kinase two-domain architecture. the counterparts of unstructured loop 149- <dig>  in 1u5r are residues 174- <dig>  which constitute the activation loop of 1u5r. one calcium ion is observed near 181pser. in the original report on 1u5r one calcium ion is observed to bind the activation loop, but the role of the calcium is not addressed <cit> .

we consider the binding of homologous proteins to calcium to be strong evidence of correct prediction. table  <dig> and figure  <dig> show calcium-binding sites in homologous holo structures demonstrate our method's robustness. meanwhile such predictions provide novel functional insights into these proteins.

the remaining  <dig> predictions are novel sites in that their corresponding holo forms have not been experimentally tested . these sites are not recognized using the motif scan programs prosite and pfam <cit> . some of these sites are found in the protein-membrane interface or near the binding area of ligands other than calcium. the candidate proteins that we scanned share scop folds families with known calcium-binding proteins. it is common that one protein may bind to multiple calcium ions. in the experimentally solved structures of  <dig> proteins for which we made predictions, calcium binding was experimentally observed at sites other than our predicted new sites. in these cases, our "hits" may represent additional new calcium sites or false positives. for the other  <dig> proteins, calcium binding has not been observed experimentally, and so our hits would be functionally new predictions of calcium binding. a total of  <dig> of these  <dig> loops contain at leaset one asp or glu residue , which are generally important residues for binding calcium, as they can provide amino acid side chains with negatively charged carboxyl groups. we discuss two examples for which independent evidence suggests that our predictions are correct.

coordinates of the predicted calcium-binding sites and the structures of the calcium-binding loops generated using modeling methods for all  <dig> predictions are available at: http://helix-web.stanford.edu/pubs/bmc-sb-liu/.

discussion
our work uses the feature program for recognizing calcium sites, but can be used with any similar structure-based method. feature outperforms published methods in detecting divalent cation binding sites  <cit> . glazer et al. compared feature with another method for predicting ligand-binding sites . at a very low level of false positives  feature identified  <dig> out of  <dig> sites in holo structures and  <dig> out of  <dig> sites in apo structures; valence identified  <dig> out of the  <dig> sites in the holo structures and zero out of  <dig> the sites in apo structures. the key contribution of this work is the combination of modeling and machine learning to recognize probable functions in disordered protein regions. our method also produces a low-resolution structural model of the missing loops. our goal is not to predict the structure of a binding site or loop with crystallographic accuracy, but to demonstrate that the modeled loop can adopt a conformation consistent with calcium binding. we first showed that feature can recognize known ligand-binding loops that are rebuilt using modeling methods. we generated de novo loop structures using two separate strategies. the rmsds between the  <dig> rebuilt loops and the corresponding natural apo loop structure range from  <dig>  to  <dig>  Å; and those to the corresponding natural holo structure range from  <dig>  to  <dig>  Å. the rebuilt loops show good structural diversity. we demonstrated that a cutoff of  <dig> has very low false-positive rate, a critical feature for prediction. since biologists may pursue a prediction with experiments, it is generally more important to have a low false positive rate than a low false negative rate. on the other hand, false positives can lead to wasted experimental resources. false negatives are not typically tested and so although regrettable, do not generally consume resources. the trade off depends on the particular goals of the investigator, and so the cutoffs can be changed to accommodate different priorities for sensitivity and specificity.

at the cutoff of  <dig>  the rmsds between the feature-recognized loops and the corresponding natural apo loop structure range from  <dig>  to  <dig>  Å; and those to the corresponding natural holo structure range from  <dig>  to  <dig>  Å. thus, the modeling protocol produces diverse loops, and then feature identifies the subset whose configuration is compatible with calcium binding. table  <dig> shows two proteins  where the experimental apo structure shows strong calcium binding signal with feature, but none of the rebuilt loops show strong signal. thus, even though the model building generally works, it does not always generate variations that are compatible with calcium binding.

we went on to show that we can combine feature with modeling methods to find binding sites that are not completely resolved experimentally . we applied this procedure to the candidate calcium-binding proteins for which experimentally solved structures are incomplete, resulting in  <dig> novel predictions of calcium-binding sites. as discussed above, we selected a cutoff score that increases the likelihood that these calcium-binding predictions are correct. some of our predictions may nonetheless be false positives, but our analysis suggests that they are very likely to be functionally interesting regions of these proteins. for example, they may bind other cations or positively charged ligands. magnesium binding is very difficult to distinguish from calcium binding using "low resolution" methods such as feature, where features are averaged in shells of thickness  <dig>  angstroms. these sites display a variety of structural characters and have a broad range of functions, providing novel insights into the studies of calcium-binding proteins.

to further test the usefulness of our protocol, we have applied it to casp <dig> targets http://predictioncenter.org/casp8/. there is only one calcium-binding protein in the  <dig> casp <dig> targets, c-terminal domain of probable hemolysin from chromobacterium violaceum . we scanned  <dig> loops in 3ded, including six calcium-binding loops and  <dig> loops as negative controls. feature successfully identifies the six calcium-binding loops. for each positive prediction, we found multiple high feature scores in both crystallographic loops as well as our modeled loops. these high scores are distributed over a relatively large volume, most likely indicating more than one calcium ion in these loops. in fact, each pair of loops binds  <dig> calcium ions. none of the  <dig> loops  are predicted as false positive. these results demonstrate that our procedure can identify calcium-binding sites successfully even when the structures of binding-loops are rebuilt using modeling methods.

our prediction strategy focused on proteins with electron density gaps that are in scop families that bind calcium. we decided to focus on these to limit the number of gaps that we modeled and evaluated for this study, and because it increased the chance that our predictions would be biologically plausible and interpretable. it would certainly be possible to predict calcium-binding loops for all unstructured loops. interestingly, only  <dig> of the  <dig> highest hits were in proteins that already had resolved binding sites. these  <dig> predictions are thus for an additional calcium site. this is not at all unusual, as many proteins bind multiple calcium ions. the remaining top  <dig> predictions are all novel and would represent the first calcium-binding site in these structures.

the most well known calcium-binding site is the ef-hand sequence motif  <cit> . we scanned  <dig> different scop fold families known to bind calcium. about 2% of structures  in these  <dig> families contain ef-hand motif. our study focused on  <dig> structures with regions of poor  electron density. only  <dig> %  of the  <dig> structures contain ef-hand motifs. furthermore, only three loops that we modeled and scanned are within the ef-hand motifs. we successfully recognize the calcium-binding activity of these three loops: they are 1sl <dig>  1u5r and 1df <dig> . the paucity of ef-hand missing protein loops suggests that they tend to be stable, even in the absence of calcium. indeed, we find that both the apo and holo states of ef-hand form ordered structures; and so experimental 3d structures of both forms are usually available. the remaining  sites generally are not associated with good sequence motifs, and seem to show higher structural flexibility

we have observed that a considerable number of predictions adopt anti-parallel beta structures, but in different topologies, including beta-barrel, beta-sandwich and greek key. these proteins display a wide range of function roles, including photosynthesis , aggregation of acetylcholine receptors , membrane insertion as a responsible for anthrax . for these proteins, calcium ions are often predicted to bind the loops between beta-strands. these structures show structural homologies with the c <dig> domains, which form an eight-stranded anti-parallel beta-sandwich consisting of a pair of four-stranded beta-sheets. the c <dig> domain is often involved in calcium-dependent membrane targeting. calcium ions often bind in an indentation formed by the first and final loops of the membrane binding face of the c <dig> domain. newton et al proposed a model for calcium-dependent membrane binding by the c <dig> domain: calcium binding induces a conformational change in the c <dig> domain in order to expose functional groups responsible for membrane binding  <cit> . in these predicted sites found in the anti-parallel beta structures, loops are not observed in crystal structures due to their high flexibility. we proposed that calcium binding to these loops induces conformational changes, which contribute to the functional roles of the loops.

we note that  <dig> proteins of our  <dig> novel predictions bind to other ligands in addition to metal ions. in those cases, it is possible that calcium plays a role in regulating the binding of other ligands, as has been observed in some proteins <cit> . for example, calcium induces a conformational change in the ligand-binding site of the ldl receptor and maintains the cysteine-rich regions in a more folded, native state. in the absence of calcium, the ldl receptor does not have the proper conformation for ligand binding. consequently, only when the ldl receptor is exposed to calcium, it is competent to bind the ligand  <cit> . in our predictions, we have predicted that calcium binding regulates the binding of 1pu or other consequent activity changes to the cell division protein kinase  <dig>  . our prediction has been confirmed by the observation of its homologous structure 1u5r. a similar role of calcium binding is observed in one of the  <dig> novel predictions, mycobacterium tuberculosis reca . we therefore propose that these  <dig> proteins' activity may be regulated by calcium binding via allosteric effects.

CONCLUSIONS
we modeled and identified calcium-binding sites for which experimentally solved  structures are not available because they have high flexibility and lack ordered  structures. combining a machine learning site-recognition algorithm  with a de novo loop modeling technique enabled us to capture binding sites not apparent in a validation set of  <dig> apo structures. we not only predict the calcium binding function, but produce at least one structural conformation to support this prediction. the idea of improving models using functional information is attractive, and may be applicable to other structure modeling efforts, when functional information is available. from the  <dig> structural gaps in experimental structures, we made  <dig> non-redundant predictions of calcium-binding sites that achieve high feature scores. in these  <dig> predictions, ten predicted sites are confirmed by experimental evidence;  <dig> predicted are supported by indirect experimental evidence;  <dig> sites are novel predictions. in the  <dig> novel predictions, a large number of predicted sites adopt anti-parallel beta structures, which share structural similarity with the calcium-binding c <dig> domain. a total of  <dig> of our  <dig> predictions are in proteins that bind to other ligands, suggesting a role of calcium in regulating ligand binding in these proteins.
