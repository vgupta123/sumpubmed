BACKGROUND

clostridium difficile is a spore-forming, anaerobic gram-positive bacterium and the leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea worldwide  <cit> . infection usually occurs in hospitalised patients receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics  <cit> . like many bacteria, c. difficile possesses an s-layer  <cit>  which is proposed to have functions such as adherence and evasion of the immune system  <cit> . the s-layer of c. difficile is composed of two surface layer proteins , termed high molecular weight  slp and low molecular weight  slp, and is encoded for by a single gene, slpa, forming an slpa protein precursor .

the hmw slp is highly conserved in c. difficile, with up to 97% sequence similarity between strains  <cit> . the protein exhibits strong and specific binding to gastrointestinal tissues and human epithelial cells  <cit> . it has been shown that the hmw protein is most likely anchored to the cell wall, and “displays” the lmw protein to the external environment  <cit> . the lmw slp exhibits greater sequence variation between strains and, as the outermost component of the organism, is likely region exposed most to the host immune system. this high level of sequence variability observed in the lmw region of the s-layer is not surprising given the evolutionary forces exerted by host defences in response to infection  <cit> ; however evidence that such sequence differences in the lmw region influence the interaction of slps with the host is lacking.

recently, there have been conflicting reports regarding the predictability of severity of infection based on c. difficile ribotype  . the prevalence of severe and recurrent disease in response to “hyper-virulent” rts such as  <dig> and  <dig> , while other common rts such as  <dig> are not associated with increased virulence, suggests a potential link between ribotype and infection severity. these strains exhibit increased antibiotic and disinfectant resistance  <cit>  increased sporulation rates  <cit>  and other possible modes of action for virulence  <cit> . another recent study has shown antibody raised against slpa from c difficile strain  <dig>  does not cross react with slpa from ribotype  <dig>  <cit> . despite slpa being examined as a vaccine candidate  <cit> , problems may still arrive due to high sequence variability of the protein coding sequences for slps between strains. we propose that slps from different strains of c. difficile may be undergoing different selective regimes, and that this variability can induce variable immune responses with consequences for the observed spectrum of severity of clinical symptoms.

previously, we demonstrated a role for tlr <dig> in the host response to c. difficile  <cit> . specifically, we showed that slps from rt  <dig> activated tlr <dig> signalling, inducing the maturation of dendritic cells in vitro and subsequent t helper cell activation  <cit> . more recently, we have shown that  <dig> slps induce clearance responses in macrophages  <cit>  and other studies have also shown slps from rt  <dig> to effectively induce an immune response  <cit> . together these findings provide a mechanism for interaction between host and pathogen. however, the influence of slp sequence on the host immune response is currently unknown, and it is possible that sequence variation may modulate inflammatory response. here we pose the question: does variation in slp sequence play a role in the severity of c. difficile infection?

in this study we determine if the vast spectrum of symptoms from mild to severe that are observed across different rts of c. difficile could result from modulation of the immune response caused by sequence variation in the slpa gene that codes for the slps. we also explored the possibility that slps from specific ribotypes are under positive selection , all of which may affect the overall disease severity.

RESULTS
the relationship between slps of different ribotypes can be depicted on a robust phylogenetic tree
fully annotated slpa sequences were taken from previously published studies  <cit> . muscle  <cit>  was used to generate a phylogenetic tree of all sequences in our dataset . likelihood mapping tests were carried out on our alignment of  <dig> rt slpa genes. the results confirmed that sufficient phylogenetic signal existed in the dataset to generate a gene tree for slpa . the slpa gene tree was reconstructed using mrbayes v  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  and visualised using dendroscope  <cit>  . the phylogeny shows that the slpa sequence from hyper-virulent rt  <dig> ribotype is closely related to that of rt  <dig> fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of the slpa protein from  <dig> strains/ <dig> major ribotypes of c. difficile. each leaf on the tree refers to a specific ribotype, these are named by ribotype number as per convention. the branch numbering scheme is shown in grey. ribotypes with very short branch lengths are given as clusters at the tips of branches. all but three nodes had posterior probability value  =  <dig> : two of these values are shown in italics on the tree . the final exception was the node joining ribotypes  <dig> and  <dig>  where * denotes pp of  <dig> . lineages under positive selection are highlighted as follows; blue corresponds to positively selected sites detected in the hmw protein, and red corresponds to positively selected sites in the lmw protein. where known, the virulence/severity of disease associated with each ribotype is denoted by a red “+” for hypervirulence




slps from different ribotypes of c. difficile have evolved under different selective regimes, with highly virulent strains exhibiting signatures of protein functional shift
we performed two types of analysis on the slpa gene alignment and phylogeny to determine heterogeneous selective pressures: firstly we examined variation in selective pressures at the level of sites across the alignment , and secondly at the level of lineage/ribotype and site combined   <cit> . all likelihood ratio tests performed were standard for these models. the portion of the alignment representing the lmw protein-coding region was highly variable between strains. under the most statistically significant model,  <dig> amino acid sites were estimated to have undergone positive selection. as visualised on the 3-d model of lmw slp these sites are largely located within a loop-rich region in domain  <dig> .table  <dig> results of site-specific positive selection analysis of the slpa gene

the lineage site-specific analyses yielded a more complex story . positive selection was detected in the hmw protein-coding region on a number of specific lineages, an area of the gene that is highly conserved across the strains in the dataset . in total, eight branches show signatures of positive selection in the hmw protein, including rts  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  these rts have been under selective pressure to adapt, and given the function of the hmw protein, we speculate that the selective pressure at play here may have been for improved adhesion to the host epithelium. also there were  <dig> lineages  that showed evidence of positive selection in the lmw protein. there are relatively few sites in the lmw region under positive selection for these lineages. of particular interest here are the results for the lmw region on branch  <dig>  leading to rt  <dig> . rt  <dig> is of clinical importance due to the fact that it is hyper-virulent, and the presence of positively selected residues in the lmw region of its slp may be a contributing factor to its increased pathogenesis. there was no evidence of positive selection in either lmw or hmw regions in the most common rt  <dig> or indeed in rt  <dig> 

two potential recombination events were detected in the slpa sequence alignment . the first was between rt  <dig> and  <dig>  with a p-value of  <dig>  x 10− <dig>  this event corresponds to position 1– <dig> in the msa, i.e., almost completely within the signal peptide, and does not overlap with our signatures for positive selection. the second signal for recombination was detected between rt  <dig> and  <dig> between positions  <dig> and  <dig> on the msa, with a p-value of  <dig>  x 10− <dig>  this region of the alignment does indeed encompass several positively selected sites. caution must therefore be taken in interpreting these particular sites, however many other positively selected sites have been detected outside of this region.table  <dig> results of recombination analysis on the slpa msa

slps from different ribotypes of c. difficile have differential effects on the production of cytokines by macrophages
we tested our hypothesis that rt-specific sequence differences in slp influences the immune response by choosing the following  <dig> samples: rts  <dig> and  <dig> that have a number of sites under positive selection, and rts  <dig> and  <dig> could not find any positive selection acting on the slpa gene. we purified the slps of these  <dig> ribotypes from clinical isolates of c. difficile , sequenced them to confirm they were identical to the samples from the database, and investigated their effects on the production of cytokines by macrophages. sterile pbs was added to the macrophages as a negative control. exposure of macrophages to slps from rt  <dig> resulted in the production of levels of il-12p <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> that were similar to lipopolysaccharide  . the cytokine levels induced by rt  <dig> were almost identical to rt  <dig>  interestingly, activation of macrophages with rts  <dig> and  <dig> slps consistently induced higher levels of il-12p <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> and in the case of il-12p <dig>  a two-fold increase was observed relative to rt  <dig> . furthermore, rts  <dig> and  <dig> also induced higher levels of the chemokines mip-1α, mip <dig> and mcp than rts  <dig> and  <dig>  although it is important to note that in the case of rts  <dig> and  <dig> the expression was to a lesser extent than lps.fig.  <dig> slps purified by fplc induce variable cytokine secretion in macrophages. a slps from  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were purified by fplc and visualised by sds-page. gel images show crude undialysed s-layer, crude dialysed s-layer and purified slp from ribotype  <dig>  purified  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> slps can also be seen by the presence of two bands around 32 kda and 44 kda, representing the lmw and hmw slps respectively. b j <dig> macrophages were stimulated with lps  and slp  from ribotypes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> for a period of 24 h, and the control is pbs. supernatants were collected and cytokine levels were analysed by elisa. the two horizontal lines represent statistical significance between control cells and 001-stimulated cells, and between 001-stimulated and 027-stimulated cells respectively. the results show the mean  for n =  <dig>  *** p <  <dig> , ** p <  <dig>  and * p <  <dig>  determined by one-way anova test comparing all groups, with a newman-keuls post test, comparing all pairs of columns




slps from different ribotypes of c. difficile have differential effects on expression of cell surface markers on macrophages
next, we examined the effects of the slps on the expression of cell surface markers that are important for antigen presentation and interaction with other immune cells. there was a strong up-regulation of cd <dig>  cd <dig> and mhc ii expression on macrophages in response to lps . the slps from rts  <dig> and  <dig> also increased expression of cd <dig>  cd <dig> and mhc ii on macrophages, but to a lesser extent than lps, with rt  <dig> evoking the weakest response. cells stimulated with rts  <dig> and  <dig> induced a higher expression of cd <dig>  cd <dig> and mhc ii than either rts  <dig> or  <dig>  this increased expression in response to rt  <dig> and  <dig> slp remained less potent than lps stimulation.fig.  <dig> slps differentially modulate cell surface marker expression on macrophages. j <dig> macrophages were stimulated with slp from ribotypes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  for 24 h. lps  was used as a positive control. results show expression of the cell surface markers cd <dig> and cd <dig>  control cells are shaded in grey, slp-stimulated cells are labelled in blue, and lps-stimulated cells are labelled in red




slps from different ribotypes of c. difficile have differential effects on phagocytosis by macrophages
a key factor in the outcome of infection caused c. difficile is the effective clearance of the bacteria; therefore, we next examined the ability of slps from the four ribotypes to induce phagocytosis in macrophages. control cells stimulated with sterile pbs had a low level of phagocytosis at 30 min; less than 5% of the population contained beads . after 1 h, this had increased marginally to 7% and by 2 h, 25% of cells had phagocytosed the beads. phagocytosis was significantly increased for lps-stimulated cells, with 17%, 25% and 53% of macrophages phagocytosing beads at the 30 min, 1 h and 2 h time points respectively. despite being less potent than lps, rt  <dig> slp also induced phagocytosis. 9%,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of macrophages were phagocytosing beads at 30mins, 1 h and 2 h respectively. rt  <dig> slp induced a similar response to rt  <dig> slp at 30mins, with  <dig> % of macrophage phagocytosing beads. after 1 h this number had increased to marginally to  <dig> %, and 22% of cells were undergoing phagocytosis at 2 h. in contrast, rt  <dig> and rt  <dig> slp-treated cells displayed a similar level of phagocytosis to the lps controls at 30mins,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of cells respectively. at 1 h, rt  <dig> slp induced phagocytosis at a similar rate to rt  <dig> . rt  <dig> slp was more potent at this time point, with  <dig> % of cells undergoing phagocytosis. at 2 h, rt  <dig> and  <dig> slp were both less potent than rt  <dig>  with rt  <dig> being marginally lower at  <dig> % and rt  <dig> at  <dig> %. table  <dig> gives all percentages of phagocytosing cells in response to slp or lps.fig.  <dig> slps induce phagocytosis at variable levels in macrophages. phagocytosis of fitc-labelled fluorescent beads by j <dig> macrophages in the presence of lps and slp ribotypes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  cells were stimulated for 24 h with slp  or lps  and beads were then added . percentage of the cell population was measured by the quantity of fitc signal from the cells using flow cytometry

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
the surface layer proteins of c. difficile coat the exterior of the bacterial cell, and are likely the first point of contact with the host immune system. the  <dig> sequences in our dataset exhibit sequence variation for the slpa gene, particularly in the area encoding the lmw protein. in this study we tested for evidence of variation in selective pressure on the slps specific to particular rts. as positive selection has been shown to be synonymous with protein functional shift, we wished to test if this sequence variation, some of which is a result of positive selection on the slps, could potentially influence the host response  <cit> .

our phylogenetic analysis provided us with a sampling strategy for in vitro testing. we detected positive selection on multiple lineages of the slpa gene tree, and on both slp subunits . we found sequence signatures of positive selection in the hmw slp for rts  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  this well-conserved region of the gene is involved in binding to the gastrointestinal tract  <cit>  and this result potentially suggests an increased selective pressure for adherence properties in these rts. of particular interest were the sites of positive selection detected on the lmw slp. as previous studies have shown a role for the lmw region in initiating an immune response , these differences between rts may affect host recognition of the pathogen. additionally, we found two hyper-virulent strains, rts  <dig> and  <dig>  with positive selection mainly isolated to the lmw subunit.

from our phylogenetic analysis we can see the slp from rt  <dig> is most closely related to rt  <dig>  a common strain with moderate severity of infection  <cit> , however rt  <dig> displays more severe virulence  <cit> . this poses an interesting question, are there molecular signatures that we can identify in sequence data that may indicate severity of disease? indeed, we identified a signature of positive selection unique to the rt  <dig> branch and the majority of positively selected sites in rt  <dig> are in the lmw region of the slpa gene. we also identified positive selection acting on the lmw region of the slpa gene on branches leading to rts  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  of these ribotypes,  <dig> is the best characterised, and was previously associated with hyper-virulence  <cit> .

the majority of sites detected as positively selected were near the outer tip of the protein, an area easily accessible to immune cell receptors. the potential benefit inferred by these amino acid substitutions for the pathogen may be in modulating the host immune response by varying motifs essential for recognition. given that rts  <dig> and  <dig> are known to be hyper-virulent strains associated with increased inflammation and persistence of infection  <cit> , this sequence variation in the slps from rt  <dig> may affect the host immune response and impact pathogen clearance.

the downstream functions of these observed mutations cannot be predicted in silico, so we attempted to gain a greater understanding of any sequence variation in a series of in vitro experiments. we focused on rts  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  sequence differences exist between these four ribotypes, with positive selection in the slpa gene predicted for rts  <dig> and  <dig>  we hypothesised that the comparison between these ribotypes would provide insight into the importance of these mutated residues in the ability of slps to interact with, and subsequently activate, the immune response.

the ability of slps to induce macrophages to produce cytokines and chemokines is an important indicator of how potently they activate the immune system. we have previously shown that rt  <dig> slps activate macrophages and dendritic cells to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines  <cit>  and the profile of cytokines induced was comparable to that of lps stimulation. in this study we observed that slps from different ribotypes elicited distinct responses in macrophages. of the four ribotypes selected for the in vitro analysis, rts  <dig> and  <dig> did not display any evidence of positive selection in their slps. despite sequence differences existing between the slps of these strains, they induce similar responses from macrophages with similar levels of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il-12p <dig>  mip-1α, mip- <dig> and mcp.

slps from rts  <dig> and  <dig> induced a more potent inflammatory response, exhibiting up to two-fold increases in il- <dig>  il-12p <dig> and il- <dig> production relative to the slps from rts  <dig> and  <dig>  pro-inflammatory il-12p <dig> is known for its importance in bacterial clearance, helping to drive a th <dig> response in cd4+ t cells. indeed, il-12p <dig> knockout mice have been shown to be unable to clear infection of gram negative bacteria francisella tularensis  <cit> . conversely, pro-inflammatory il- <dig> has been shown to induce tissue damage during bacterial infection  <cit> . therefore, the higher levels of these cytokines induced by hyper-virulent rts  <dig> or  <dig> may contribute to increased inflammation and further tissue damage. chemokine production was also increased by rts  <dig> and  <dig>  indicating the potential for enhanced cell recruitment. the ability to recruit immune cells to the site of infection is important in mounting an efficient response to bacterial pathogens  <cit> , however increased macrophage recruitment can also result in inflammation and disease, which has been shown in c. difficile infections caused by the rts  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . slps from these ribotypes also induced higher levels of the anti-inflammatory il- <dig>  given the role of il- <dig> in the differentiation of regulatory t cells in suppressing inflammatory responses  <cit> , increased levels of il- <dig> may act to impair clearance mechanisms late in inflammation, allowing the bacteria to persist in the gut. il- <dig> has previously been shown to block resistance to pathogens  <cit>  and can directly inhibit phagosome maturation  <cit> . this correlates with our observation that rt  <dig> and  <dig> slps do not enhance phagocytosis rates relative to rt  <dig>  despite a heighted cytokine response. this may help to further explain the hyper-virulent state of rts  <dig> and  <dig> 

we demonstrate that macrophages stimulated with slps from rts  <dig> and  <dig> expressed higher levels of cd <dig>  cd <dig> and mhc ii than those induced by either rt  <dig> or  <dig>  this again provides evidence that slps from rts  <dig> and  <dig> induce a more potent inflammatory response in macrophages. once again we see little difference between the effect of  <dig> and  <dig> on the expression of these markers, even though there are sequence differences. the differences we observe in immune response between rt  <dig> and rt  <dig> may be influenced by very specific sites in the slpa gene. the ability of macrophage to phagocytose invading pathogens is a crucial determinant in clearance of disease  <cit> . we observed a similar trend in the cells’ ability to phagocytose in response to slp. the slps from our four rts activated the cells and induced phagocytosis in a similar fashion to lps. the rate at which cells phagocytosed however varied between ribotypes. slps from rt  <dig> induced the highest rate of phagocytosis relative to lps. slps from rt  <dig> induced the weakest phagocytic response, in line with the observed minimal cytokine responses. rt  <dig> slp induced similar, if marginally lower, levels of phagocytosis relative to rt  <dig>  despite rt  <dig> slp being a much more potent inducer of pro-inflammatory cytokines. as previously stated, the 027-induced increase in il- <dig> may account for this, rendering them no more efficient at activating macrophages to engulf and destroy the pathogen. the lack of enhanced phagocytosis in response to these potent rt  <dig> and  <dig> slps, along with increased cytokine production may suggest high levels of inflammation are beneficial in some way to the bacteria. indeed it has been shown that phagocytosed c. difficile spores can readily survive inside the phagosomes of macrophages  <cit> . this increased inflammatory state in the gut will increase tissue damage, and expose the pathogen to components of the extracellular matrix to which it can bind  <cit> , thereby allowing the bacteria to gain a greater foothold.

to fully understand the significance of the observed differences in immune response between slps from different ribotypes, further analyses, including the use of animal models, must be carried out. further expansion of the library of slps available for study will also allow comparisons between more diverse strains. this study clearly highlights the ability of slps to induce variable immune responses, and that slps purified from “hyper-virulent” strains seem to induce more potent inflammation. the slps from hyper-virulent strains  consistently caused macrophage to produce high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and cell surface markers. levels of phagocytosis for these two ribotypes were lower than lps-induced phagocytosis and comparable to rt 001-induced phagocytosis. this shows that despite greater induction of pro-inflammatory cytokine production, the slps from the hyper-virulent ribotypes studied do not activate macrophages to physically clear the bacteria at a greater rate than rt  <dig> 

we have detected evidence for positive selection in the slpa gene of several strains of the pathogen, and while we cannot directly correlate positive selection with increased inflammatory potency, the pattern of selective pressure observed warrants further investigation. additional experimentation examining the effects of site-directed mutagenesis on the predicted sites may elucidate the true role these mutations have on the host immune response. regardless of the role of positive selection, it is evident that slps isolated from these hyper-virulent strains do indeed modulate the host response, potentially for the benefit of the pathogen. inhibition of clearance will increase and prolong inflammation, resulting in epithelial tissue damage, allowing the pathogen to invade deeper, binding to extracellular matrix components as previously reported  <cit>  and leading to a colitis-type state in the gut, which is frequently observed in severe c. difficile infections  <cit> . these results suggest the importance of slps in disease susceptibility and severity, and that positive selection and protein functional shift in the slp protein may be playing a role in driving the emergence of hyper-virulent strains.
