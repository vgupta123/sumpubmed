BACKGROUND
aureobasidium pullulans  g. arnaud is a polyextremotolerant black yeast of considerable biotechnological importance, and it has exceptional stress tolerance and increasing medical relevance  <cit> . a. pullulans is well known for its production of pullulan, a neutral polysaccharide of repeating maltotriose units, which has numerous applications in medicine, pharmacy, the food industry, and other fields  <cit> . a. pullulans also produces a β-glucan that shows high reactivity to human igg antibodies  <cit>  and possible beneficial immunomodulatory effects  <cit> . a. pullulans has an unusually large spectrum of extracellular enzymatic activities  <cit> . several of these are of biotechnological interest, and include: amylases, cellulases, lipases, proteases, xylanases, β-fructofuranosidases, maltosyltransferases, mannanases, and laccases . at least some of these appear to have interesting traits that are different from their homologues in other species  <cit> .

a strain of a. pullulans is used for the production of a cyclic peptide that has specific antifungal activity: aureobasidin a  <cit> . due to its strong antagonistic activity against other microorganisms, a. pullulans is used as a biocontrol agent in agriculture  <cit> . additionally, a recent study reported that some strains of a. pullulans can produce an antibacterial compound, exophilin a, as well as high yields of liamocins, and heavy oils with previously unknown acylated mannitol structures, which have possible industrial applications as surfactants  <cit> .

the occurrence of a. pullulans is widespread in tropical, temperate and polar areas. it is frequently found in association with diverse plants, such as in the phyllosphere  <cit> , as an epiphyte or endophyte, on stored barley grain  <cit> , and in coconut water  <cit> . a. pullulans has also been found in numerous other habitats, some of which are particularly unusual, such as coastal hypersaline water  <cit> , glacial ice  <cit> , other polar environments  <cit> , polluted water  <cit> , refrigerated, frozen, salt-preserved and dried foods  <cit> , various indoor habitats , the surface of human skin  <cit> , aviation fuel tanks  <cit> , and the surface of synthetic polymers  <cit>  and of degrading polyurethane and pvc plastics  <cit> . a. pullulans has been reported to cause a variety of localised infections in humans, and even systemic infections, although very rarely . it has been suggested that this infection potential is at least partially supported by the production of extracellular enzymes  <cit> , and by the pronounced stress tolerance of a. pullulans <cit> .

aureobasidium pullulans has evolved an exceptional tolerance for a broad range of ecological conditions. it is considered a polyextremotolerant organism  <cit> , and it can survive hypersaline  <cit> , acidic, basic  <cit> , cold and oligotrophic  <cit>  conditions. some of the a. pullulans adaptations to stress  are associated with rigorous management of intracellular concentrations of alkali-metal cations  <cit> , synthesis of compatible solutes  <cit>  and of mycosporines  <cit> , and adaptation at the level of the membrane-lipid composition  <cit> . a. pullulans can also mitigate environmental stress by rapid dimorphic switching from small colourless yeast cells to thick-walled, heavily melanised, meristematic forms  <cit> .

the genus aureobasidium is a member of the order dothideales , and it comprises  <dig> taxa , with a. pullulans being by far the most studied of these. although the distinction of varieties and forms of a. pullulans has been suggested, the name a. pullulans is mainly used in research databases. the most recently described species of aureobasidium are a. leucospermi crous  <cit> , a. proteae  joanne e. taylor & crous  <dig>  <cit> , and a. thailandense s.w. peterson, manitchotpisit & leathers  <cit> .figure  <dig>

various loci have been sequenced in the past to infer the taxonomy and phylogeny of the taxa in aureobasidium, such as internal transcribed spacer  rdna, intergenic spacer  <dig>  translation elongation factor-1α, β-tubulin, and rna polymerase ii . based on a multilocus analysis of a worldwide selection of a. pullulans-like isolates, it was confirmed that the earlier described variety a. pullulans var. melanogenum hermanides-nijhov is distinct from a. pullulans  g. arnaud  <dig>  in addition, two new varieties have been described: a. pullulans var. subglaciale zalar, de hoog & gunde-cimerman, and a. pullulans var. namibiae zalar, de hoog & gunde-cimerman. a. pullulans var. aubasidani yurlova , which had been previously described due to its structurally unique polysaccharide, aubasidan, was synonymised with a. pullulans var. pullulans <cit> .

in  <dig>  the infraspecies classification of the varieties was retained in the redefinition of the species to prevent confusion linked to the use of new or additional epithets in applied fields  <cit> . nevertheless, substantial phenotypic differences in growth-temperature range, melanisation, and tolerance to nacl had already been observed among the varieties. a. pullulans var. pullulans is found mostly in mildly osmotic environments, it is frequently associated with plants, and it can tolerate up to 17% nacl , the highest salt concentration of all four of the a. pullulans varieties  <cit> . a. pullulans var. melanogenum has been isolated mainly from oligotrophic, aqueous environments, and it grows at 37°c, while the other varieties cannot. on the other hand, a. pullulans var. subglaciale is unique for its psychrotolerant nature  and its occurrence in glacial habitats in svalbard . finally, a. pullulans var. namibiae was named based on a single isolate from namib desert marble  <cit> . polymorphism is evident within a. pullulans, even within the varieties , and the species has been proposed as a model for the investigation of fungal phenotypic plasticity, because of the unique colony morphologies, the frequent changes in appearance and growth-temperature regimes, and the different nutrient requirements and morphological responses to light among its strains and varieties  <cit> .

the genome sequence of one strain of each of the above-described varieties of a. pullulans was obtained: a. pullulans var. pullulans, a. pullulans var. melanogenum, a. pullulans var. subglaciale , and a. pullulans var. namibiae . the results of the genome analyses performed are presented and discussed in the following sections.

RESULTS
the sequencing of the genomes of the four varieties of a. pullulans was aimed to uncover the genetic basis of their many interesting and useful traits. this included three aspects in particular:  their biotechnological potential ;  their exceptional stress tolerance ; and  evidence in favour of describing these varieties as separate species.

genome properties: sequencing and assembly of the genomes
the genome assembly sizes of the four sequenced varieties of a. pullulans were  <dig>  mb ,  <dig>  mb ,  <dig>  mb , and  <dig>  mb  . these are smaller than the sizes of all but one of the  <dig> dothideomycete fungi that were compared by ohm et al.  <cit> , and that had an average genome size of almost 39 mb.table  <dig>

aureobasidium pullulans var. pullulans contains more repetitive sequences than the other a. pullulans varieties. however, the level of the repetitive sequences is low across all four of these varieties , and cannot explain the differences in their genome sizes. a. pullulans var. pullulans is the most halotolerant of the four investigated varieties  <cit> , and it was isolated from hypersaline water. therefore, it is interesting to note that investigations of saccharomyces cerevisiae have revealed a tendency towards increased genome size as a response to high concentrations of salt  <cit> . an increased genome size was also observed for the extremely halotolerant black yeast hortaea werneckii, which has experienced recent whole-genome duplication  <cit> . however, the increase in the genome size of a. pullulans var. pullulans is less extensive, as its genome is only  <dig> % larger than the genome of its closest relative, a. pullulans var. subglaciale.

the numbers of predicted proteins  do not differ substantially from those observed in related fungi, where the average number of the predicted proteins in  <dig> related species that were analysed in a recent study was  <dig>  <cit> . the median number of introns in the predicted genes of a. pullulans varieties is two introns per gene, with a median length of 57 bp . between 80% and 90% of the predicted proteins are in all four of the a. pullulans varieties, while 16% to 19% of the proteins are duplicated .figure  <dig>

 biotechnological potential of the aureobasidium pullulansvarieties
synthesis of pullulan
pullulan is a linear α-d-glucan that is made of maltotriose units connected with α- <dig>  linkages, while the glucose units within the maltotriose are connected with α- <dig> -glycosidic bonds. this alternation of the bonds gives the molecule its distinctive physical properties: flexibility, solubility, adhesive ability, biodegradability, and the ability to form viscous solutions, and oxygen-impermeable and transparent fibres and films. pullulan thus has broad application value  <cit> . despite its economic importance, relatively little is known about the biosynthesis of pullulan. duan et al.  <cit>  proposed a biosynthetic pathway in which the key enzymes for converting glucose units into pullulan were α-phosphoglucose mutase, uridine diphosphoglucose pyrophosphorylase, and glucosyltransferase.

there are single-copy genes for phosphoglucose mutase and uridine diphosphoglucose pyrophosphorylase in all four a. pullulans varieties. this is expected, as both of these enzymes catalyse important metabolic reactions, and they have been evolutionarily conserved. the enzyme phosphoglucose mutase catalyses a key step in hexose metabolism: the interconversion of glucose 1-phosphate and glucose 6-phosphate. the enzyme uridine diphosphoglucose pyrophosphorylase catalyses the reversible formation of uridine diphosphoglucose from glucose 1-phosphate and utp. as described below, the predicted a. pullulans secretomes contain representatives of several carbohydrate-active enzyme  database families  <cit> , which include members with glucosyltransferase activities. thus all four a. pullulans varieties contain all of the putative enzymes that were proposed to be involved in the biosynthesis of pullulan by duan et al.  <cit> .

kang et al.  <cit>  showed that disruption of the putative pullulan synthetase gene  of a. pullulans  reduces its exopolysaccharide production to a pure β-glucan. each of the predicted proteomes of the four a. pullulans varieties contains one similar protein . all of these are predicted as being secreted. the low similarity scores can be attributed to the differences in annotation, as the pul gene prediction in genbank contains an atypically long intron  and its second exon lies in a poorly conserved region . when the annotation of the pul gene  was corrected to correspond to our annotation, it contained a one-nucleotide frameshift–insertion at nucleotide position  <dig> . after this was removed, the resulting protein-coding sequences and the predicted protein sequences were more than 70% identical. it is possible that the insertion in af <dig> was an artefact of the sequencing and that it led to the differences in the above-described gene annotation. if the pul gene is indeed involved in pullulan production, this observation is of significant importance.

synthesis of aureobasidin a and siderophores
strains of a. pullulans are used efficiently as biocontrol agents of post-harvest diseases  <cit> . not only numerous hydrolytic enzymes  <cit> , but also various antimicrobial compounds, such as exophilin a  <cit> , siderophores  <cit>  and aureobasidin a  <cit> , might have roles in the strong antagonistic effects of a. pullulans towards other species.

the antibiotic aureobasidin a is a cyclic nonadepsipeptide  <cit>  that shows strong fungicidal activity, including against candida species, cryptococcus neoformans, and some aspergillus species  <cit> . aureobasidin a has been shown to inhibit the phosphatidylinositol:ceramide phosphoinositol transferase that is involved in sphingolipid synthesis  <cit> . the synthesis of aureobasidin a is catalysed by the 11659-amino-acid-long biosynthesis complex that is encoded by the intronless gene aba <dig> of the a. pullulans strain r <dig>  <cit> .

the four sequenced a. pullulans varieties have not been tested previously for aureobasidin a production. however, their genomes do not include any homologues of the aba <dig> gene. this is not entirely surprising, as the production of aureobasidin a is not a universal trait of a. pullulans.

however, in a search for aureobasidin a synthase, a group of similar non-ribosomal peptide synthases was identified, although these proteins are substantially shorter than aureobasidin a synthase  and are most similar to synthases for siderophores. a. pullulans var. melanogenum and a. pullulans var. namibiae have one putative synthase for siderophores, whereas a. pullulans var. subglaciale has two copies, and a. pullulans var. pullulans has three.

siderophores are iron-chelating compounds with substantial biotechnological potential that are known to be produced by a. pullulans <cit> . siderophores have been reported to act as antimicrobials  <cit> . their presence is also in line with the oligotrophic nature of a. pullulans, as they are beneficial under conditions of iron-depletion. additionally, in other fungi, siderophores have roles in virulence, fungal–host interactions, and resistance to oxidative stress  <cit> .

secondary metabolite biosynthesis clusters
fungi produce a multitude of low-molecular-mass compounds, known as secondary metabolites, which have roles in a range of cellular processes, such as transcription, development, and intercellular communication  <cit> . many of these compounds have important applications as antibiotics or immunosuppressants  <cit> , and they are used in medicine or for plant protection  <cit> . genome mining investigations have indicated that the ability of fungi to produce secondary metabolites has been substantially underestimated, because many of the fungal secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters are not expressed under standard cultivation conditions  <cit> .

in a. pullulans var. pullulans, only nine secondary metabolite biosynthetic clusters were identified with antibiotics and secondary metabolites analysis shell . however, there are  <dig> clusters in a. pullulans var. namibiae, and  <dig> in each of a. pullulans var. melanogenum and a. pullulans var. subglaciale . these cluster numbers are surprisingly high, and although many cannot be assigned to production of a certain metabolite, their abundance suggests that the genomes of these a. pullulans varieties represent rich resources for secondary metabolite biosynthesis. in comparison, antismash predicted 45 t <dig> polyketide synthase/non-ribosomal peptide synthase/dmat gene clusters in penicillium chrysogenum,  <dig> clusters in aspergillus fumigatus <cit> , and a total of  <dig> putative gene clusters in a draft genome sequence of streptomyces ansochromogenes   <cit> . for example, lantipeptide biosynthetic clusters from a. pullulans var. pullulans, var. namibiae and var. melanogenum might be of particular interest. lantipeptides are post-translationally modified peptides that have antimicrobial properties. lantipeptides were initially believed to be produced only by gram-positive bacteria, but later studies revealed a much wider diversity of lantipeptide producers than previously appreciated   <cit> . although dozens of new lantipeptides have been isolated in recent years, bioinformatic analyses indicate that many hundreds more await discovery, owing to the widespread frequency of the lantipeptide biosynthetic machinery in the bacterial genome  <cit> .table  <dig>

secreted proteins
an unusually large spectrum of extracellular enzymatic activities has been described for a. pullulans, many of which are of considerable biotechnological interest . some of these, such as alkaline serine proteases, glucanases and chitinases, are also believed to have roles in the above-described antagonistic effects of a. pullulans against phytopathogenic fungi  <cit> .

the in-silico predicted set of secreted proteins comprises  <dig> proteins for a. pullulans var. pullulans ,  <dig> for a. pullulans var subglaciale ,  <dig> for a. pullulans var. namibiae , and  <dig> for a. pullulans var. melanogenum  . the proportion of the proteins that contain signalp  and tmhmm  sequences is comparable to that in other fungi  <cit> . the largest group of the secretory proteins are those similar to enzymes that are active against carbohydrates . most of these are glycoside hydrolases .table  <dig>

large enzyme groups are written in bold text. their subgroups are written in normal text.



all four of these a. pullulans varieties also contain a large number of enzyme families, the members of which are known to be involved in the degradation of plant material, as designated by  <cit> . these are discussed below.

the enzymes involved in the degradation of pectin are represented by three families of polysaccharide lyases , and the families of gh <dig> , gh <dig> , gh <dig>  and the carbohydrate esterases ce <dig> . the gh <dig> family  is only present in a. pullulans var. namibiae, although it is not recognised as secreted. no representatives of the polysaccharide lyases from the pl <dig> and pl <dig> families were identified.

in all four of these a. pullulans varieties we identified five out of seven protein families with members that are involved in  the degradation of cellulose . a. pullulans var. namibiae contains all of the  <dig> families that contain hemicellulases , while the other three a. pullulans varieties lack the gh <dig> family . this diversity is comparable to, and in some cases even larger than, other plant pathogenic fungi  <cit> , including those from dothideomycetes   <cit> , and it is larger than in most of the saprophytic fungi, especially in the case of the hemicellulases   <cit> .

although the sequence-based families of carbohydrate-active enzymes frequently group together enzymes of varying substrate specificities, they are nevertheless considered to be good reporters of fungal lifestyles, especially when considering broad substrate categories, such as cellulose, hemicellulose or pectin  <cit> . the richness of the enzyme families that are involved in the degradation of plant material is thus interesting in light of the epiphytic lifestyle of a. pullulans. when comparing individual varieties, proteins containing pfam protein family domains , which are characteristic for the gh <dig> , gh <dig> , gh <dig> , gh <dig> , and gh <dig>  families, are significantly enriched in a. pullulans var. pullulans compared to the other varieties , while the gh <dig> and gh <dig> families are depleted in a. pullulans var. melanogenum. this corresponds to the plant-related ecology of a. pullulans var. pullulans and to the largest phylogenetic distance between a. pullulans var. pullulans and a. pullulans var. melanogenum.

the numbers of genes and families of secreted proteases in the genomes of a. pullulans are also comparable to those found in the dothideomycete plant pathogens  <cit> . all of the subfamilies of the merops database of proteolytic enzymes  <cit> , which are expected to efficiently digest proteins and/or to work in inhospitable environments of the extracellular matrix , are represented in these predicted secretomes. the only exception is c <dig> protease, which is recognised as being secreted only in a. pullulans var. melanogenum, whereas the homologues from the other varieties are not. the family of scytalidoglutamic peptidases  contains even more representatives than in the analysed plant pathogens. aspartic proteases  and the a <dig> family  are enriched in a. pullulans var. pullulans.

the number of lipases in the predicted secretomes is relatively low, although the number of cutinases, which are enzymes that are important for the degradation of the plant cuticle, is in the range observed in related plant pathogens  <cit>  . however, some of the putative cutinases are not designated as secreted with the criteria used in the present analysis, so the actual number of these enzymes might be even higher.

tannases are another group of enzymes that are significantly enriched within the genome of a. pullulans var. pullulans. tannases, or tannin acyl hydrolases , catalyse the hydrolysis of ester bonds in the hydrolysable tannins and gallic acid esters. these enzymes are used industrially as catalysts in the manufacture of gallic acid, and they also have potential use in beverage and food processing  <cit> .

given the previously recognised substantial biotechnological potential of the large spectrum of the extracellular enzymatic activities of this fungus , which is confirmed here by the predicted secretome, their application should be brought to a new level with the availability of these genomic data. the wide array of enzymatic activities should also be considered when investigating the pathogenicity potential of a. pullulans. as already noted by chan et al.  <cit> , lipases, phospholipases, proteases and β-lactamases are important virulence factors that might have roles in a. pullulans as an emerging opportunistic human pathogen.

biodegradation of plastic and aromatic compounds
black yeast, including a. pullulans, are known for their ability to degrade aromatic pollutants  <cit>  and plastic  <cit> . in the a. pullulans ay <dig> strain, chan et al.  <cit>  reported the presence of genes coding for 2-monooxygenases and catechol dioxygenases  and depolymerase . there are two families of 2-monooxygenases in these four a. pullulans varieties. the larger of these has six representatives in each of a. pullulans var. pullulans and a. pullulans var. subglaciale, five in a. pullulans var. melanogenum, and four in a. pullulans var. namibiae. the second family contains only one representative in a. pullulans var. pullulans and a. pullulans var. subglaciale. a family of proteins with catechol  <dig> -dioxygenase activity is also present, with four representatives in a. pullulans var. melanogenum and five in each of the other three a. pullulans varieties. there are single-copy genes for poly-β-hydroxybutyrate depolymerase, an enzyme that can degrade polyhydroxyalkanoates  <cit> , in all four of these a. pullulans varieties. the presence of these genes underlines the considerable potential of a. pullulans for use in bioremediation or biodegradation processes.

major facilitator superfamily sugar transporters
the major facilitator superfamily  of sugar transporters is the largest group of secondary transmembrane carriers. this consists of  <dig> protein families, each of which is specialised for the transport of a certain type of substrate. they have different transport modes, from uniport, to solute:cation  symport and/or solute:proton or solute:solute antiport. most of these have  <dig> to  <dig> amino acyl residues, with two six-transmembrane segment repeat units  <cit> . according to the transporter classification  database  <cit> , two representatives in this group, the mfs family  and the glycoside-pentoside-hexuronide:cation symporter family , contain sugar-specific families of secondary active transporters. in eukarya, only two families of mfs sugar transport substrates are known, of which the sugar porter family  is the largest of all of the mfs families, with several hundred known members. the sugar porter family is diverse with respect to their substrate specificity, and they can work either as uniporters or as cation symporters. the other familiy of sugar transporters is the sialate:h <dig> symporter family   <cit> .

according to cafe analysis, proteins that contain the pfam domain, which is characteristic for sugar-transport proteins , are significantly enriched in the genomes of all four a. pullulans varieties. when comparing these varieties individually, the sugar-transport proteins are also significantly enriched in a. pullulans var. pullulans, while they are depleted in a. pullulans var. melanogenum. detailed analysis has revealed great diversity of these transporters . the sugar porter family contains from  <dig>  to  <dig>  predicted proteins, which is much higher compared to the  <dig> transporters of neurospora crassa <cit> , or the  <dig> of s. cerevisiae <cit>  . however, it is lower than the number of mfs sugar transporters in aspergillus nidulans  and aspergillus oryzae  . more than three quarters of the transporters in these four a. pullulans varieties are classified as sugar: h+ symporters , while in s. cerevisiae, more than half are uniporters  <cit> .table  <dig>

large transporter groups are written in bold text. their subgroups are written in normal text.



the high numbers of sugar transporters correspond to the nutritional diversity of a. pullulans, while the differences between the four a. pullulans varieties might reflect their ecological preferences. a. pullulans var. pullulans is most frequently associated with plants, and it thus has access to various sugars of plant origin. on the other hand, a. pullulans var. melanogenum has significantly fewer sugar transporters, and it is associated more with freshwater habitats, where simple sugars are not as readily available. it is also separated from a. pullulans var. pullulans by the largest evolutionary distance of all of these a. pullulans varieties. the most notable difference between these varieties is in the number of the putative maltose or α-glucoside: h+ symporters , as a. pullulans var. melanogenum has almost half the number of copies compared to the other varieties.

 polyextremotolerance
components of the high-osmolarity glycerol pathway
the mitogen-activated protein kinases  are involved in many cellular processes, such as stress responses and regulation of differentiation and proliferation, and they are highly conserved in eukaryotes. this system consists of three kinases that phosphorylate one another in a signalling cascade. one of the best-characterised is the high-osmolarity glycerol  pathway, which is a branched mapk signal-transduction system, the physiological role for which in fungi is primarily the mediation of cellular adaptation to increased osmolarity of the surrounding medium. the hog pathway is also required for adaptation to other stress conditions, such as oxidative, heavy-metal, and hot or cold stress  <cit>  and in the virulence of pathogenic fungi  <cit> .

the hog pathway in fungi consists of two major signalling modules. one is the mapk module that comprises mapk, mapk kinase , and mapkk kinase . the other module is a two-component phospho-relay system that is composed of hybrid sensor kinases, a histidine-containing phosphotransfer protein, and response regulators; this system senses and relays environmental signals, and subsequently activates the hog pathway  <cit> .

as expected, the main components  <cit>  in the four a. pullulans varieties are very similar to those in other fungi. these genomes contain one homologue of each kinase in the mapk module , one ste <dig> kinase homologue, and one homologue of all of the components in two sensory branches sln <dig> and sho <dig> . interestingly, a. pullulans var. pullulans and a. pullulans var. namibiae have two predicted homologues of ste <dig> or cla <dig> kinases , while the other two varieties have only one. one of the duplicated homologues is missing the pleckstrin-homology domain . this domain has roles in the recruitment of proteins to different cellular membranes, and thus enables the proteins to interact with other components of the signal-transduction pathways  <cit> . whether the observed difference has a role in the polyextremotolerance of a. pullulans remains a question for future studies.

genes involved in the biosynthesis of compatible solutes
stress tolerance is frequently associated with accumulation of small organic molecules that can act as protective compounds against different stress factors . in a. pullulans, exposure to high temperatures or high salt concentrations, or a combination thereof, leads to increased intracellular concentrations of the polyhydroxy compounds trehalose, mannitol and glycerol  <cit> . the concentrations of trehalose in a. pullulans increase in heat-stressed cells, and in simultaneously heat-stressed and salt-stressed cells, but not in cells subjected to salt stress alone. mannitol increases under all of the stress conditions that have been examined, while an increase in intracellular glycerol has only been detected in salt-stressed cells  <cit> . indeed, in response to a saline stress, glycerol is the most abundant compatible solute . in other microbes, glycerol, trehalose and other polyols are also very important for life in extremely cold environments  <cit> . this might also be the case in the psychrotolerant a. pullulans, however, the role of compatible solutes at low temperatures has not yet been studied in this species.

glycerol is synthesised from dihydroxyacetone phosphate, a glycolytic intermediate, via two reaction steps that are catalysed by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide -dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  and glycerol-3-phosphatase   <cit> . both of the genes that encode these enzymes required for glycerol biosynthesis are present in the genomes of all four of these a. pullulans varieties, as single-copy genes. the yeast s. cerevisiae and the halophilic basidiomycete wallemia ichthyophaga each have two copies of gpd  <cit> , while the extremely halotolerant h. werneckii has four, two of which can be attributed to a whole-genome duplication event  <cit> . the predicted gpd proteins from a. pullulans lack the n-terminal pts <dig> sequence that is important for peroxisome localisation, a trait also noted in other halotolerant fungi  <cit> . it was proposed that the constant cytosolic localisation of the gpd <dig> homologues is advantageous for the organisms that live in extremely saline environments  <cit> , as the osmoprotective role of gpd is dependent on the cytosol and nuclear fractions of this protein  <cit> .

the biosythesis of trehalose is a two-step process in which glucose 6-phosphate and udp-glucose are first converted to α,α-trehalose 6-phosphate by trehalose-6-phosphate synthase , and then to trehalose by trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase   <cit> . in ascomycota, mannitol is also synthesised in two steps: fructose 6-phosphate is first reduced to mannitol 1-phosphate by nad-dependent mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase , and then dephosphorylated to mannitol, by mannitol-1-phosphate phosphatase   <cit> . one copy of trehalose-phosphatase was found in each of the four investigated a. pullulans varieties, and two relatively dissimilar  trehalose synthases were identified. two proteins in each variety have predicted mannitol dehydrogenase activities. one is similar to the homologues that are crucial for mannitol biosynthesis in other fungi, while the other is probably involved in the first step in the catabolism of mannitol  <cit> . interestingly, no homologues of known fungal mannitol-1-phosphate phosphatases were found in any of these four a. pullulans genomes.

in the genomes of all four of the a. pullulans varieties, we identified a putative d-xylose reductase . d-xylose reductase converts xylose to xylitol, a sweetener compound. the production of xylitol is a commercially interesting process  <cit> , which has rarely been contemplated in a. pullulans <cit> .

melanin biosynthesis genes
the cells of a. pullulans produce a black pigment that has long been known to be  <dig> -dihydroxynaphthalene -melanin  <cit> . melanin is a high-molecular-weight, dark brown or black pigment that can be produced by numerous fungi  <cit> , and it has a known protective role under various stress conditions , and also under hypersaline conditions  <cit> . melanin is located in the fungal cell wall, either enmeshed within the structure of the cell wall, or as its outermost layer  <cit> . microbes predominantly produce melanin pigment via tyrosinases, laccases, catecholases, and the polyketide synthase pathway  <cit> .

dothideomycetes mostly produce dhn-melanin via the polyketide synthase pathway  <cit> . dhn-melanin biosynthesis starts with polyketide synthase, with acetyl coenzyme a or malonyl coenzyme a as a precursor. the polyketide synthase produces  <dig> , <dig> -tetrahydroxynaphthalene, which is reduced by hydroxynaphthalene reductase to form scytalone. dehydration of scytalone by scytalone dehydratase forms  <dig> ,8-trihydroxynaphthalene. in turn,  <dig> ,8-trihydroxynaphthalene reductase converts  <dig> ,8-trihydroxynaphthalene to vermelone, which is further dehydrated by scytalone dehydratase, to  <dig> -dhn. subsequent steps are believed to involve dimerisation of the  <dig> -dhn molecules, followed by polymerisation that is catalysed by p-diphenol oxidase  <cit> .

one melanin polyketide synthase gene was identified in each of these four a. pullulans varieties. this is in agreement with findings in the other dhn-melanin–producing fungi, which also have one melanin polyketide synthase . additionally, there are one of each of the trihydroxynaphthalene reductase-like gene and tetrahydroxynaphthalene reductase-like gene. each of the two reductases from these four a. pullulans varieties falls within either a trihydroxynaphthalene-like or a tetrahydroxynaphthalene-like group, as has been observed in other melanised fungi. one of the traits not expected is the presence of two scytalone dehydratase-like genes in all of the investigated varieties except a. pullulans var. melanogenum. these duplicated genes form two distinct phylogenetic groups. furthermore, our phylogenetic analysis of the scytalone dehydratases from these four a. pullulans varieties and the scytalone dehydratase sequences collected from the ncbi-nr protein database show the presence of two scytalone dehydratases in several other fungal species as well . these duplicated genes form two distinct phylogenetic groups: the larger one  contains scytalone dehydratases from known dhn-melanin–producing fungi, and proteins  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . the second cluster has two subclusters: one  contains the three duplicate proteins from a. pullulans var. subglaciale, a. pullulans var. pullulans and a. pullulans var. namibiae , together with both scytalone dehydratase proteins from fusarium, botryotinia and metarhizium. the other subcluster  contains proteins that produce bluish-green pigment through the dhn-melanin pathway  <cit> , and it has no homologues in the four a. pullulans varieties . this is the first report of several scytalone dehydratase genes and proteins in a single fungal species. thus, we have identified here genes that possibly encode essential components of the dhn-melanin biosynthesis pathway in all four of these a. pullulans varieties.

aquaporins
a large family of major intrisic proteins , which are membrane-channel proteins that are selective for the transport of water  or water plus glycerol , has been found in diverse life forms  <cit> . all of the aquaporins are transmembrane proteins with six transmembrane domains, and with their n-terminus and c-terminus in the cytosol. these are water channels that are 109-fold faster compared to ion channels and transporters. the presence of solute-permeable aquaporins represents a new concept in terms of absorption, not only because of the rate of the process, but also because of its osmotic implications  <cit> .

orthodox aquaporins mediate rapid and selective fluxes of water across biological membranes, and hence they have important roles in the osmoregulation of cells and organisms. aquaglyceroporins, on the other hand, facilitate transmembrane transport of small uncharged molecules, like polyols, urea, arsenite, and many more, thereby having roles in nutrient uptake, osmoregulation, and probably other processes  <cit> . petterson et al.  <cit>  divided the fungal aquaporins into four groups: one group of orthodox aquaporins, and three groups of aquaglyceroporins . a later phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> major intrisic fungal proteins by xu et al.  <cit>  also classified the aquaporin-like genes into four clusters, delineated by functionally characterised major intrisic fungal proteins: orthodox aquaporins, aquaglyceroporins, facultative fungal aquaporins, and x intrinsic proteins.

altogether,  <dig> aquaporin-like and aquaglyceroporin-like genes were identified in a. pullulans var. pullulans, a. pullulans var. melanogenum and a. pullulans var. subglaciale, and  <dig> in a. pullulans var. namibiae. these numbers are higher than those in other species: e.g., laccaria bicolor has six or seven aquaporins, and the numbers in other investigated fungal species have been reported to be even lower  <cit>  . therefore, the high number of aquaporin-like and aquaglyceroporin-like genes in the genomes of these four polyextremotolerant a. pullulans varieties is striking. such an abundance is typical for plants and mammals  <cit> , but not for fungi. our phylogenetic analysis of these a. pullulans aquaporin-like sequences and the sequences analysed by xu et al.  <cit>  shows that the major intrisic proteins from aureobasidium varieties cluster with orthodox aquaporins, or true water channels , with fungal aquaglyceroporins , and with facultative aquaporins  . as these water channels and osmoregulators enable sufficient water and/or compatible solute fluxes into and out of the cells under various osmotic conditions, the high abundance of aquaporins in these four a. pullulans varieties might be vital for survival and adaptability of these polyextremotolerant species in water-challenged environments. however, the possible beneficial effects of increased copy numbers of these proteins for survival in extreme environments have not been indicated previously. furthermore, as only the mips in model yeast species and mycorrhizal fungal species have been studied so far, the aquaporins from the fungal species that inhabit various extreme habitats  might have either high efficiency or unique mechanisms of aquaporin regulation  <cit>  that are still awaiting discovery.figure  <dig>

alkali-metal cation transporters
as a halotolerant species, a. pullulans has to maintain its intracellular cation homeostasis during changing and occasionally high environmental salinities. under such conditions, the maintenance of a high and stable k+ content and the elimination of toxic na+ ions is crucial for survival  <cit> . however, it is not clear if and how the number of alkali-metal cation transporter genes is correlated with the halotolerance of an organism. the genome sequencing of the extremely halotolerant black yeast h. werneckii revealed an extensive enrichment of genes that encode transporters of alkali-metal cations  <cit> . these appear to allow h. werneckii to maintain the very low internal na+ concentrations that are observed even at high external nacl concentrations  <cit> . on the other hand, genome sequencing of the most halophilic fungus known, the basidomycete w. ichthyophaga, uncovered only modest numbers of ion-transporter genes, and additionally showed that their transcription is relatively low and non-responsive to different salt concentrations  <cit> .

the analysis of these four a. pullulans genomes revealed several duplications of plasma-membrane transporters, but not of those located on the intracellular organelles . this is not entirely surprising, as the organelle membranes are protected by the relatively stable intracellular environment, rather than being exposed to the high extracellular fluctuations of inorganic salt ions  <cit> . from an additional analysis, which included the homologues from other dothideomycetes along with the sequenced genomes of the four a. pullulans varieties, it is clear that most of the duplications observed occurred in the relatively distant evolutionary past . three such events can be observed for the nha na+/h+ antiporter and the trk k+ importer, two for the pho na+/pi importer, and one for the ena na+ exporter, the tok k+ exporter and the acu k+ importer. cochliobolus heterostrophus still has representatives in almost all of the resulting subgroups , followed by a. pullulans var. melanogenum , a. pullulans var. pullulans , a. pullulans var. subglaciale , h. werneckii , cladosporium fulvum , and a. pullulans var. namibiae  .table  <dig>

s. cerevisiae contains two typical k+-transport systems: trk <dig> and trk <dig>  which are high-affinity channels for k+ uptake  <cit> , while the tok <dig> membrane-depolarisation-activated channel is for k+ efflux  <cit> . ena <dig>  ena <dig> and ena <dig> p-type atpases  and the nha <dig> antiporter, which is driven by a proton gradient, can also contribute to k+ efflux, although they are primarily known as exporters of na+. in a. pullulans, both trk and tok channels are duplicated . a. pullulans var. pullulans contains another homologue of trk that belongs to cluster  <dig>  which is still present in h. werneckii and c. heterostrophus, but not in other fungi analysed. the same is true for a. pullulans var. subglaciale, although its homologue is uncharacteristically short .

unexpectedly, in addition to trk, all of these four a. pullulans varieties contain two less-common k+ uptake systems : the hak h+/k+ symporters, which under some conditions appear to act as na+/k+ symporters  <cit> ; and the acu p-type atpases  <cit> , which are encoded by not one, but two relatively divergent genes in each of these genomes . both of these types of transporters are present in only a few other dothideomycetes. according to the predicted phylogeny, it is parsimonious to assume that both of these k+ uptake systems were present in the ancestor of h. werneckii and were lost later in the evolution of this by-far-the-most halotolerant of all of the species analysed. therefore, the primary purpose of the redundancy of these k+ uptake systems might not be adaptation to salt.

in other groups of transporters two duplications were observed in the above-mentioned nha na+/h+ antiporter, and one duplication in the ena na+ exporters . the smaller number of ena genes compared to nha  has already been noted for h. werneckii <cit> . two duplication events and the subsequent loss of genes  led to different numbers of pho na+/pi symporters in these individual a. pullulans varieties . in salty environments, the na+ gradient possibly represents an alternative energy source for the influx of pi <cit> .

the most halotolerant of all of the species that have been analysed, h. werneckii, contains the highest number of transporter genes , although it should be noted that the number is doubled due to the recent whole-genome duplication of h. werneckii <cit> . the second largest number of transporter genes is present in c. heterostrophus , which is not a halotolerant species , and is not found in hypersaline habitats. the high number of plasma-membrane k+ transporters of a. pullulans  is in even starker contrast with the most halophilic fungus known, the basidiomycete w. ichthyophaga. the latter has only one trk-encoding gene, and has no homologues of the tok, hak or acu transporters  <cit> .

when comparing only these four a. pullulans varieties, the most halotolerant a. pullulans var. pullulans has neither the highest number nor the largest diversity of transporters. furthermore, although in s. cerevisiae the ena pumps are the major determinant of salt tolerance , a. pullulans var. pullulans even has one ena gene homologue less than the other a. pullulans varieties. although the number of alkali-metal cation-transporter genes in a. pullulans is higher than in many related fungi, this difference is not particularly outstanding. it appears that the diversity and the total number of alkali-metal cation-transporter genes are  only approximate predictors of halotolerance.

only one gene for the plasma-membrane proton-exporting atpase pma is present in each of these four a. pullulans varieties. in contrast, h. werneckii has four copies of this gene, and their expression is salt responsive  <cit> . pma pumps are responsible for establishing the electrochemical gradient of protons across the plasma membrane, and through this, they supply the energy to the secondary active symporters and antiporters  <cit> , among which there are also those responsible for maintaining ion homeostasis under hypersaline conditions.

in addition to the pma pumps, other transporters might be responsible for the building of the electrochemical gradient of protons. type  <dig> microbial rhodopsins can function as proton pumps to establish the electrochemical gradient for atp production. this process has already been demonstrated in another dothideomycetous fungus, leptosphaeria maculans <cit> . an alternative way to build this proton-motive force would not only be useful in hypersaline conditions, as has already been proposed for the extremely halotolerant h. werneckii <cit> , but it might also be of importance in the light-exposed, oligotrophic biology of a. pullulans; e.g., to rapidly resume metabolism after cryptobiosis. the search for bacteriorhodopsins revealed at least two gene copies in the genomes of all four of the a. pullulans varieties . the copies within these genomes differ in terms of their spliceosomal intron numbers and positions. according to our reconstructed phylogeny, these bacteriorhodopsin copies with one and two introns formed monophyletic groups , and appear to represent old duplications before the split of the lineages within a. pullulans. however, a. pullulans var. melanogenum contains an additional third copy, suggesting either a recent duplication in this a. pullulans variety or a loss of a paralogue in the other a. pullulans varieties.

although bacteriorhodopsins from a. pullulans have not yet been used for biotechnological purposes, they can be considered for the many different applications that this family of proteins has; e.g., mainly for optical appliances, but also for therapeutic/medical applications and research, including in optogenetics and bioelectronics  <cit> .

 description of new aureobasidiumspecies
the genus aureobasidium  is a conglomerate of cosmopolitian taxa. the correct taxonomic distinction of the phylogenetic clusters of this genus is of great importance for their industrial applications and investigations of their medical relevance. the analysis of the kr distances between the genome pairs and the number of amino-acid substitutions per site of the aligned proteomes shows that the differences between these four a. pullulans varieties are comparable or larger than those observed between s. cerevisiae and three of its relatives, and especially its closest relative, saccharomyces paradoxus . substantial differences between the genomes of these four a. pullulans varieties were also observed when their scaffolds were aligned with mummer  <dig>  . thus, in combination with previous knowledge, this suggested an elevation of these four a. pullulans varieties to the species level.figure  <dig>

elevation of these four a. pullulans varieties to the species level
a revised concept for the species a. pullulans is presented here. these four varieties of a. pullulans are elevated to the species level based primarily on the phylogenetic analysis of their whole genome sequences, as well as on their phylogenetically relevant genes.

taxonomic markers for distinguishing the new aureobasidium species
species/varieties within the genus aureobasidium have most often been distinguished based on multilocus analyses of different regions of the rdna gene clusters. the its region has been most commonly used , although it is recognised as insufficient in certain genera  <cit> . based on the its rdna, the distinction of aureobasidium pullulans was possible, but the resolution based on other household genes was better  <cit> . therefore, the different household genes used earlier in the phylogenetic analyses of aureobasidium and of other genera were compared here. the selected genes encode for the following proteins: actin , β-tubulin , calmodulin , chytin synthase , nad-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , mini-chromosome maintenance proteins essential for initiation of eukaryotic genome replication , rna polymerase  <dig>  the largest subunit , rna polymerase  <dig>  the second-largest subunit , and translation elongation factor 1α . cal and chs are present in several different copies in these four aureobasidium taxa and are thus less appropriate for use in phylogenetic analyses. other markers were identified as single-copy genes in the genomes.

the overview of these genes – their length, number of exons/introns, possible candidate regions for phylogenetic markers in aureobasidium species, and markers/regions already used in the phylogenetic analyses of aureobasidium species are provided in table  <dig> table  <dig>

the sequences of act, gpd and mcm <dig> have not yet been used in phylogenetic studies of aureobasidium, although they represent appropriate candidate regions for such studies  <cit> . the positions of the introns in these genes are conserved in all four of the investigated genomes. to evaluate the usefulness of the listed gene exons and introns as barcodes for species identification or as phylogenetic marker loci, further analyses based on a larger set of aureobasidium strains are required.

comparisons of these loci show substantial differences among the sequenced aureobasidium species. the largest variation is observed in the gpd gene. the lowest pairwise distance is between a. melanogenum and a. namibiae , and the highest between a. subglaciale and a. melanogenum . the smallest variation among these studied genes is in the act gene, where the pairwise distances range from  <dig>  in a. melanogenum versus a. namibiae, to  <dig>  in a. pullulans versus a. melanogenum .table  <dig>

the genome sequences generated here also allowed the correct identification of two other ‘a. pullulans’ strains for which the genomes had been sequenced in the past and are publicly available. strain atcc  <dig> , which is of an unknown origin, but it has been used in numerous industrial applications, is confirmed as a. pullulans. the sequenced strain ay <dig>  which was isolated from a human patient  <cit> , is identified as a. melanogenum according to the above-presented species concept. the new species a. melanogenum also includes all other infection-causing ‘a. pullulans’ strains. of the other commonly used ‘a. pullulans’ strains, strain nrrl y- <dig> is one of the commonly used strains for pullulan production, and it is related to a. melanogenum. on the other hand, the strain r <dig>  which is used for aureobasidin a production, could not be reliably classified with the publicly available sequences, since in the phylogenetic analyses it was placed in a lineage separate from the here-described four species. the two aureobasidium strains that are sold as commercial agricultural biocontrol products  remain in the species a. pullulans – for this purpose it is important to note that the species a. pullulans does not contain any potentially opportunistic pathogens, as these are placed in the newly described a. melanogenum.

homothallic mat loci and evidence for sexuality
a possible teleomorph of a. pullulans, columnosphaeria fagi  m.e. barr, was suggested on the basis of the its sequence similarity  <cit> , although this was not further confirmed either by a multilocus analysis or by a single-spore re-isolation of the fungus. due to the lack of the recombination between the four previous a. pullulans varieties, it was concluded that a. pullulans is strictly clonal, although recombination within the four phylogenetic clusters of a. pullulans strains  was not definitively ruled out  <cit> . however, the redefinition of these varieties as the four aureobasidium species  implies that the lack of the recombination between the varieties might be simply a consequence of interspecific reproduction barriers and not a sign of asexuality. the genome sequences of the four reclassified aureobasidium species reveal additional details about their possible mating strategies.

the sexual reproduction of ascomycetous fungi is orchestrated by the presence of different arrangements of mating-type genes that encode the key transcription factors at one or more of the mat loci: the mat1-1- <dig> gene encodes a protein with an alpha <dig> domain, and the mat1-2- <dig> gene encodes a protein with a high mobility group  box  <cit> .

one mating type locus can be clearly recognised in each of the four investigated aureobasidium species. the mating-type locus in all four of these species has a conserved organisation, and contains one of each of the mat1-1- <dig> and mat1-2- <dig> homologues in opposite orientations . this structure of the homothallic mat locus, where two mat idiomorphs are linked but not fused on the same locus, is also present in some other dothideomycetes   <cit> . another set of genes in a syntenic region of all four of these aureobasidium species  might have the role of the second mating type locus, mat <dig> figure  <dig> 
configuration of the homothallic

there is an open reading frame of an unknown function between the mat1-1- <dig> and mat1-2- <dig> genes in three of the studied genomes, with the genome of a. subglaciale being the exception. in a. subglaciale, this open reading frame is still present as a pseudogene, but due to a substantial degeneration, its structure can be discerned only approximately. in sordariomycetes and eurotiomycetes, the mat locus frequently lies between the homologues of the s. cerevisiae apn <dig> and sla <dig> genes  <cit> . in the here investigated aureobasidium species, this is the case for the apn <dig> homologues ; while the homologues of sla <dig> are located on the same scaffold, they are separated from the mat genes by a substantial distance .

the single-copy homologues of other genes involved in mating were found outside of the mating loci, including g-protein-coupled receptor for alpha-factor  and a-factor , and the transcription factor that activates genes involved in mating or pseudohyphal/ invasive growth pathways . out of nine meiosis-specific genes listed by malik et al.  <cit> , five were identified . interestingly, the homologue of mer <dig>  a dna helicase that is involved in crossing over  <cit> , is present in three copies in a. melanogenum, and in two copies in a. pullulans, a. subglaciale and a. namibiae.

the roles of absent genes might be provided by alternative proteins. for example, the species a. pullulans contains two homologues of rad <dig>  which is a protein involved in the repair of double-strand dna breaks. this might replace dmc <dig>  which performs the same function, but only in meiosis. furthermore, the absence of the dmc <dig> homologue in sexual fungi is not unusual  <cit> .

according to their genetic design, all four of the aureobasidium species can be considered as homothallic , which implies that a single strain is capable of sexual reproduction even in an axenic culture. however, the existence of mating genes is not conclusive evidence for sexual recombination, as these genes might also have other roles, as has been reported in other species of fungi  <cit> . as a teleomorph of the previously recognised a. pullulans has not been described yet, the ability of these four aureobasidium species to undergo sexual reproduction needs to be confirmed experimentally.

CONCLUSIONS
aureobasidium pullulans, as it was previously defined, was considered a species of exceptional adaptability. this was reflected in its great phenotypic plasticity, polyextremotolerance, and the ability to survive across a wide variety of habitats. a part of this diversity can be explained by the relatively wide definition of this species. however, with the accumulation of new knowledge, it had become clear that smaller, well-defined groups of strains can be recognised within a. pullulans. these were initially described as varieties  <cit> , but this comparison of their genomic data shows that the differences between these varieties are large enough to justify their redefinition as four separate aureobasidium species: a. pullulans, a. melanogenum, a. subglaciale and a. namibiae.

even single strains of a. pullulans can show wide adaptability, and this is reflected in the great diversity of several groups of genes. this diversity can reach, or even surpass, the gene diversity of more specialised related species, even though almost all of them have larger genomes. the investigated genomes of these four aureobasidium species contain an abundance of different families of extracellular enzymes, which are important for the degradation of the plant cell-wall material. their diversity is comparable to the phylogenetically related plant pathogens. the differences in the abundance of the extracellular enzymes and also in the higher numbers of sugar transporters reflect the ecological preferences of the four studied aureobasidium species, especially for the plant-associated lifestyle of a. pullulans. furthermore, for example, all four of the aureobasidium genomes presented here have genes for the alternative k+ importers hak and acu, which are not found even in the extremely halotolerant h. werneckii or in the halophilic w. ichthyophaga. also, when considering the mating strategy, these four aureobasidium species appear to be more flexible than the specialised h. werneckii and w. ichthyophaga: the four aureobasidium genomes all contain a homothallic mating type locus, whereas h. werneckii is heterothallic, and w. ichthyophaga lacks the mating genes altogether.

the genome sequences of the described four aureobasidium species are expected to facilitate the exploitation of the substantial biotechnological potential of these fungi. for most of the interesting genes, at least four different genome copies are now available for study, with potentially different traits of the proteins that they encode. additionally, we propose the elimination of the decade-old annotation error in the putative pullulan synthase gene. furthermore, the genes for the degradation of a variety of compounds from plant polysaccharides to plastics and aromatic compounds should lead to more efficient industrial use of these aureobasidium species, as well as help in the selection or construction of the best strains for any given purpose.

the polyextremotolerant character of the investigated aureobasidium species indicates that they have efficient stress-combating mechanisms, some of which have been described here. these mechanisms can potentially be used in the future to improve the stress tolerance of economically important microorganisms or plants. last but not least, as the opportunistic human pathogens belong only to a. melanogenum, the phylogenetic redefinition of the previously recognised a. pullulans will facilitate the identification of the more problematic strains and help in limiting their use in applications in which they might represent potential health risks for workers or consumers.
