BACKGROUND
cellular responses to internal and external signals are mediated by the expression of specific genes or sets of genes, which are regulated by specific transcriptional factors  <cit> . therefore, the entry of transcription factors into the nucleus is critical to their role in gene expression. signals from cytokines and growth factors are transduced into the nucleus by the janus kinase -signal transducers and activators of transcription  signaling pathway  <cit> . jak-stat signaling is also involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, motility, and apoptosis in different organs  <cit> .

the binding of signal molecules to their receptors initiates activation of jaks, which increases their tyrosine kinase activity  <cit> . the activated jaks phosphorylate tyrosine residues on the receptor, which turns into a binding site for proteins that contain phosphotyrosine-binding src homology  <dig>  domains such as stats  <cit> . the stats bound to the phosphorylated receptor are then tyrosine-phosphorylated by jaks. these phosphorylated stats act as docking sites for other stats, which results in dimerization. activated stat dimers accumulate in the nucleus, bind to consensus dna-recognition motifs in the promoter regions of cytokine-inducible genes, and activate transcription of these genes  <cit> . stats are also activated by non-receptor tyrosine kinases such as v-src and receptor tyrosine kinases such as growth factor receptors  <cit> .

there are seven distinct stats in mammals  that participate in jak-stat signal transduction with different jaks . stat <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are expressed mainly in specific cell types and participate predominantly in host defense mechanisms; stat <dig> is critical for interferon  function and innate immunity  <cit> . for example, stat <dig> is selectively stimulated by ifn-gamma which has antiviral, immunoregulatory, and anti-tumor properties  <cit> . in mice lacking stat <dig>  all physiological functions associated with ifns are absent, leading to a remarkable sensitivity to viral infections and other pathological agents  <cit> . this important physiological activity of stat <dig> is expected to be conserved in fishes. indeed, ectopic expression of the zebrafish stat <dig> rescues ifn-induced signaling in a stat1-deficient human cell line, indicating that the ifn/stat1-dependent signaling pathway in mammals might be functionally and structurally conserved in fishes  <cit> . in support of this, hirame rhabdovirus -infected olive flounder have leukocytes with upregulated levels of mrna for the components of the ifn/stat1-dependent signaling pathway, such as interferon-inducible  <dig> k protein , cef- <dig>  and stat <dig>  <cit> .

recently, flounder interleukin- <dig>  ifn-alpha, ifn-beta, and type- <dig> cytokine receptors were cloned and characterized  <cit> , which suggest the presence of stat genes in this fish. in addition, a number of cytokines and growth factors have been cloned, and their activities have been successfully detected in rainbow trout and carp  <cit> . however, limited information is available on stat <dig> in edible fishes, despite recent efforts to understand ifn-mediated anti-viral activity in fish. in this study, we present for the first time the cloning and expression analysis of a olive flounder stat <dig> 

RESULTS
amplification of the sh <dig> domain
the stat <dig> molecule can be divided into seven functional domains: an n-domain responsible for dimer-dimer interactions, a coiled-coil domain responsible for protein-protein interactions, a dna-binding domain, a linker domain implicated in transcription, an sh <dig> domain responsible for receptor binding and dimerization, a tyrosine phosphorylation site, and a transcriptional activation domain  <cit> . among these seven domains, the sh <dig> domain shows the highest amino acid sequence similarity between various species and between stat families. for example, the stat <dig> sh <dig> domains of human and zebrafish show 82% identity.

this structural conservation of the stat sh <dig> domain in different species prompted us to clone stat <dig> from p. olivaceus. first we constructed three degenerative pcr primers that represent three highly conserved peptide sequences within the sh <dig> domains of zebrafish and human stat <dig>  and conducted degenerative pcr reactions. the strategy for degenerative pcr used in the experiments is depicted in fig. 1c. pcr product of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp were obtained from first round and second round pcr reaction, respectively. as a control, parallel pcr experiments were conducted with zebrafish cdna, and we obtained a similar result, a ~450-bp pcr product, with the same primers used for flounder . these results strongly suggest that the 800-bp pcr product encodes a partial sequence of flounder stat <dig> 

to confirm that the nested pcr product is flounder stat <dig>  we cloned and sequenced the pcr product. the cloned cdna was  <dig> bp and contained sequences that perfectly matched with the primers.

complete sequence of the flounder stat1
the complete cdna of the flounder stat <dig> gene was compiled by overlapping the sequences of the cloned cdna and the 5'-race and 3'-race pcr products. the flounder stat <dig> transcript consisted of  <dig>  bp, which translated into a 749-amino acid  open reading frame  that included an 103-bp 5'-untranslated region  and a 556-bp 3'-utr. the assembled full-length cdna sequence was entered in genbank under accession number ef <dig>  the flounder stat <dig> protein is the same size as that of zebrafish , similar to that of rainbow trout , and larger than that of crucian carp , which is missing  <dig> aa at the c-terminal end. the flounder stat <dig> protein contains the conserved domains of stat proteins; the n-terminal domain , coiled-coiled domain , dna binding domain , a linker , sh <dig> domain , and the transcriptional activation domain . the deduced flounder sequence contains a conserved tyrosine phosphorylation site  in the c-terminal activation domain. in addition, it contains the -e422e- and -v451vv- residues that are involved in dna binding activity  <cit> , -p719msp for serine phosphorylation  <cit> , and the arginine residue  that is required for sh <dig> phosphotyrosine binding  <cit> .

the amino acid sequence of the putative flounder stat <dig> was compared to known stats from different species . the overall similarity between the flounder stat <dig> and other stats was very high; snakehead stat <dig> showed the highest identity  and similarity  at the amino acid level. crucian carp stat <dig> showed the lowest 61% identity and 77% similarity . figure  <dig> shows the phylogenetic tree based on amino acid sequence similarity. flounder stat <dig> belonged to the same monophyletic group as snakehead stat <dig> . zebrafish stat <dig> and human stat <dig> were also included in the same monophyletic group. these results strongly indicate that the cloned dna in this study indeed encodes the ortholog of flounder stat <dig>  we also note that the flounder stat <dig> sh <dig> domain has been well conserved, and that it should play similar roles regulating stat <dig> activity. as mentioned previously, zebrafish stat <dig> can compensate for human stat <dig> in inducing ifn-mediated signaling pathways in stat1-deficient human cell lines  <cit> . because zebrafish and flounder stat <dig> have very high similarity , we expect that flounder stat <dig> also plays important roles in ifn-mediated immune activity in flounder.

northern blot analysis of flounder stat <dig> genes
we examined the mrna expression of flounder stat <dig> by northern blot analyses. as a control, zebrafish total rna was analyzed using zebrafish stat <dig> cdna as a probe. as shown in fig. 4a, we detected bands of approximately  <dig>  and  <dig> kb. according to a previous report, the former corresponds to stat <dig> and the latter to stat <dig> in zebrafish  <cit> . cross-reactivity of stat <dig> with stat <dig> mrna is possible because the probe was derived from a 465-bp pcr fragment from the conserved sh <dig> domain, which has  <dig> % nucleotide sequence identity between stat <dig> and stat <dig>  <cit> . similarly, we examined stat <dig> expression in flounder and observed a single ~3-kb message, which is almost the same size as the zebrafish stat <dig>  <cit> . considering the high sequence similarity in the sh <dig> domain of zebrafish stat <dig> and stat <dig>  we expected see an mrna band for stat <dig> but did not detect another band . although seven stat genes have been identified in mammals  <cit> , only stat <dig>  stat <dig>  and stat <dig> have been identified in zebrafish  <cit> , stat <dig> in rainbow trout and crucian carp  <cit> , and stat <dig> in pufferfish  <cit> . in zebrafish, only cdna clones containing stat <dig> were detected using a probe derived from stat <dig>  the presence of different forms of stat genes in other fish but failure in the detection of stat <dig> with the conserved sh <dig> domain probe in flounder suggests the possibility of finding more stat genes in flounder with low nucleotide sequence similarity.

expression of flounder stat <dig> in different tissues and developmental stages
some stats, including stat <dig>  are expressed in early stages of development, and null mutants for stat <dig> in mice are embryonic lethal  <cit> . in contrast, stat <dig> in vertebrates is dispensable for normal development  <cit> . early expression of mouse stat <dig> has been detected only in endothelial cells of decidual vasculature and decidual cells, which indicates maternal expression of this gene  <cit> . similarly, zebrafish stat <dig> gene expression was not detected by in situ hybridization before  <dig> days post-fertilization   <cit> . as shown in fig. 5a, flounder stat <dig> expression could be detected in all developmental stages, including the fertilized egg. also, expression of stat <dig> increased in accordance with development. increased mouse stat <dig> expression has been observed from postnatal day  <dig> to adulthood in the cerebellum and cerebral cortex. in our experiment, total rna was extracted from fertilized eggs and later developmental stages. therefore, the site of stat <dig> expression could not be determined and needs to be further characterized.

there are many reports of stat <dig> expression in different tissues or cells of vertebrates, but studies of expression of fish stat proteins in different tissues are limited. sung et al.  <cit>  observed the same expression of stat <dig> in different tissues. we analyzed the expression of flounder stat <dig> mrna using quantitative real time rt-pcr and in situ hybridization. as shown in fig. 5b, flounder stat <dig> was expressed in all tested tissues. however, there was a difference in expression level; expression was low in the liver, skin, and muscle, whereas it was high in the gill, spleen and kidney. this was further confirmed by in situ hybridization, which showed high expression of stat <dig> mrna in the gill, spleen and kidney . the tissues probed with sh <dig> domain probe showed blue appearance and there was no "hot spot" of stat <dig> expression in these tissues, and stat <dig> expression was detected in most cells in these tissues.

stat <dig> is involved in signaling pathways initiated by both ifn-α/β and ifn-γ, which are important to innate antiviral responses and adaptive cell-mediated immune responses, respectively. in both, stat <dig> is in an inactivated latent form in the cytoplasm and is activated by binding of ifns to their receptors. therefore, basal expression of stat <dig> is necessary for a prompt response to a signal. for example, higher basal expression of stat <dig> and stat <dig> in cardiac myocytes results in higher antiviral protection  <cit> . the gill is the front line of defense when fish encounter foreign substances, including pathogenic microorganisms. therefore, high expression of stat <dig> is necessary for prompt and efficient innate immune responses. similarly, spleen and kidney play important roles in the adaptive immune response of fish  <cit> , and high expression of stat <dig> can be expected. our results indicate that flounder stat <dig> is expressed throughout development and that tissue with high stat <dig> expression are involved in defense against pathogens.

CONCLUSIONS
flounder is one of the main edible fishes in asia and is also one of the most lucrative fishes in marine culture. however, many problems hamper the mass production of flounder through high-density culture. in particular, frequent mass mortality induced by viral and bacterial infections causes serious damage to the flounder industry. therefore, biological research on the immune system of flounder is highly important, not only for academic purposes but also for commercial and industrial purposes. we cloned flounder stat <dig> and found that the sh <dig> domain is conserved. our results suggest that flounder may use the highly specialized jak-stat pathway for cytokine signaling. further identification of ifn and isoforms of stat proteins will provide more detail about the signaling and immune responses of this economically important fish.
