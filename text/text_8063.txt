BACKGROUND
germline mutations in the gene encoding lkb <dig>  a serine/threonine kinase, results in peutz-jeghers syndrome , characterized by intestinal hamartomas and increased incidence of epithelial cancers  <cit> . inactivating mutations in lkb <dig> have also been found in sporadic human cancers, for example 34% of lung adenocarcinomas and 19% of squamous cell carcinomas  <cit> . many cervical cancer cell lines harbor lkb <dig> deletions and expression of lkb <dig> in the cervical cell line hela-s <dig>  is reported to induce a g <dig> cell-cycle arrest, in agreement with it playing a role as a tumor suppressor  <cit> .

lkb <dig> regulates several important biochemical pathways, including cell metabolism, cell cycle and cell polarity, but it is not clear which of these are responsible for its tumor suppressor activity. its ability to regulate metabolic pathways, such as enhanced uptake of glucose and fatty acid oxidation in response to a decrease in cellular atp levels, is probably the best understood pathway in mammalian cells  <cit> . in lower organisms, however, its ortholog par- <dig> is best characterized as a polarity determinant. par- <dig> was first identified in c. elegans as required for establishing the anterior-posterior axis during cell division of the zygote, while in d. melanogaster it regulates polarity establishment in the embryonic epithelium  <cit> .

the contribution of lkb <dig> to cell polarity in mammalian cells has not been extensively explored. the activation of lkb <dig> in an intestinal epithelial cell line, through over-expression of its adaptor protein strad, was reported to induce a polarized morphology in single cells, as visualized by the assembly of an actin-rich brush border on one side of the cell to form an apical-like surface  <cit> . further analysis has revealed that the mst <dig> kinase and the actin filament binding protein ezrin act downstream of lkb <dig> in the pathway leading to brush border formation  <cit> . since the polarized assembly of actin filaments is a key feature of all epithelial cells, the mechanism by which lkb <dig> interacts with the actin cytoskeleton is therefore of great interest. whether the loss of lkb <dig> seen in epithelial cancers contributes to the tumorigenic process through effects on the actin cytoskeleton remains an interesting possibility.

members of the rho gtpase family are important regulators of the actin cytoskeleton and of cell polarity and dysregulated rho pathways have been linked to the process of tumor progression  <cit> . rho and rac are required for the assembly of cell-cell junctions in a wide variety of epithelial cells, while cdc <dig>  through its interaction with the par6/atypical pkc polarity complex, is required for the establishment of apical-basal polarity  <cit> . so far there have been few reports linking lkb <dig> to rho family gtpases and actin. depletion of lkb <dig> in migrating non-small cell lung cancer cells, for example, affects cdc <dig> activity at the leading edge, though it is not clear if this directly influences actin filament assembly pathways  <cit> . intriguingly, tuberous sclerosis protein  <dig> , a protein that acts downstream of lkb <dig> to control mtorc <dig> activity, interacts with ezrin and can promote rho-dependent assembly of actin filaments when expressed in cells  <cit> . to explore the connection between lkb <dig> and actin filament assembly, we have introduced an lkb <dig> expression construct into hela-s <dig> cells, a cervical cancer cell line that lacks endogenous lkb <dig>  we have found this promotes actin fiber formation, through activation rho via the exchange factor dbl.

RESULTS
lkb <dig> expression induces stress fiber formation in hela-s <dig> cells
hela-s <dig> cells contain undetectable levels of endogenous lkb <dig> <cit> . to determine whether lkb <dig> can affect the organization of actin filaments, hela-s <dig> cells were transiently transfected with an lkb <dig> expression plasmid. as reported previously, lkb <dig> localizes in the nucleus and in the cytosol .  <dig> hours after transfection, the diffuse thin actin filaments present in control cells  were re-organized to form parallel stress fibers traversing cell bodies . visualization of cells with an anti-paxillin antibody revealed that control cells contain predominantly peripheral focal complexes . lkb <dig> expression induced more classical, elongated focal adhesions located in the cell body and associated with the ends of actin filament bundles . a small fraction of lkb <dig> was found to be associated with the plasma membrane .

lkb <dig> kinase domain is required for stress fiber and focal adhesion formation, but kinase activity is not
to explore the mechanism by which lkb <dig> induces stress fibers, constructs encoding a series of deletions or kinase dead mutations  were used. two kinase-dead lkb <dig> mutant constructs  were able to induce stress fibers as well as wild type lkb <dig> . mutant constructs lacking the kinase domain, however, lost their ability to form stress fibers . a construct encoding only the kinase domain of lkb <dig> , or a kinase dead, kinase domain  was sufficient to promote stress fiber formation in hela-s <dig> cells .

stress fiber formation requires rhoa
rho gtpases are important regulators of actin filament assembly and their involvement in lkb1-induced stress fiber formation was examined. hela-s <dig> cells were transfected with sirna smartpools targeting different rho family members  and  <dig> days later cells were re-transfected with a myc-tagged wild-type lkb <dig> expression construct. depletion of rhoa prevented stress fiber formation after lkb <dig> expression , but depletion of other rho gtpases had no effect . the effect of rhoa depletion by the sirna smartpool was confirmed using the  <dig> individual sirna duplexes  all of which efficiently depleted rhoa levels . co-transfection of a dominant negative form of rhoa  with lkb <dig> also blocked stress fiber formation , while dominant negative cdc <dig>  did not . rock  is an important rhoa effector involved in actin stress fiber formation  <cit> . cells expressing lkb <dig> were treated with the rock inhibitor y- <dig>  for  <dig> hours and this completely inhibited stress fiber formation as expected . these experiments suggest that lkb <dig> induces actin filament assembly through activation of a rhoa/rock pathway and that this is direct and not via activation of cdc <dig> or rac.

lkb <dig> expression results in activation of rhoa
to determine whether lkb <dig> expression induces activation  of rho, a rho. gtp- pulldown assay was performed on hela-s <dig> cell lysates using a gst-rhotekin fusion protein attached to agarose. expression of either wild type or kinase-dead lkb <dig> led to a 3- <dig> fold increase in rhoa.gtp levels, compared to control cells, whereas expression of the c-terminus of lkb <dig> had no detectable effect .

stress fiber formation requires the exchange factor dbl
guanine nucleotide exchange factors  catalyze exchange of gdp for gtp on rho gtpases to activate the conformational switch. the experiments described above raise the possibility that lkb <dig> activates a gef specific for rho  <cit> . of the  <dig> gefs encoded in the human genome,  <dig> have been reported to have activity specific for rho . hela-s <dig> cells were transfected with sirna smartpools targeting each of these gefs and two days later, cells were re-transfected with an lkb <dig> expression construct. depletion of one gef, dbl, efficiently blocked stress fiber formation induced by lkb <dig> . this effect was confirmed using two dbl individual sirna duplexes, both of which depleted endogenous dbl protein as judged by western blot analysis .

the lkb <dig> kinase domain interacts with dh/ph domain of dbl
the dbl protein consists of several recognizable domains, including a  <dig> residue dh domain  adjacent to a  <dig> residue ph domain  . this dh/ph motif is responsible for catalytic nucleotide exchange activity in rho family gefs. to determine whether lkb <dig> can interact with dbl, myc-tagged full length lkb <dig> was expressed in hela-s <dig> cells and immunoprecipitated with an anti-myc antibody or a control igg antibody. western blot analysis using an anti-dbl antibody revealed co-precipitation of endogenous dbl with lkb <dig> . similarly, immunoprecipitation of endogenous dbl with an anti-dbl antibody led to co-precipitation of myc-tagged lkb <dig> . next, different myc-tagged-lkb <dig> constructs were expressed in hela-s <dig> cells and immunoprecipitation reactions carried out with the anti-dbl antibody. both wild-type and kinase dead lkb <dig>  were found to co-precipitate equally well with endogenous dbl , but lkb <dig> constructs lacking the kinase domain did not .

to identify the region of dbl required for interaction with lkb <dig>  different dbl constructs  were expressed in hek293t cells as gst fusion proteins. the proteins were purified from cell lysates using glutathione-agarose beads. equal amount of beads were then incubated with lysates made from hela-s <dig> cells expressing myc-tagged wild type lkb <dig>  lkb <dig> was efficiently captured by dbl constructs containing the dh/ph domains , but not by constructs containing only the n-terminal regulatory sequences . we conclude that lkb <dig> interacts with the dh/ph region of dbl.

co-expression of lkb <dig> with strad leads to the formation of actin puncta
the lkb <dig> adaptor protein strad facilitates nuclear export of lkb <dig> and is required for full activity  <cit> . to determine the effect of strad overexpression, myc-tagged lkb <dig> and xpress-tagged strad expression constructs were co-transfected into hela-s <dig> cells. significantly more lkb <dig> was found in the cytosol of co-transfected cells than in cells transfected with lkb <dig> alone . in addition, actin filaments coalesced to form puncta , which were associated with phosphorylated ezrin . co-expression of strad with a d194a kinase dead lkb <dig> construct produced similar actin puncta . interestingly, the ezrin/actin puncta are localized on the dorsal surface of the transfected cells .

discussion
in addition to its well-studied role in the regulation of energy metabolism, the ability of lkb <dig> to promote cell polarity and actin filament organization is highly conserved across animal species. in drosophila, lkb <dig> mutations affect apical-basal polarity in a variety of epithelial tissues, including larval wing discs and the retina  <cit> . further analysis revealed that in some tissues at least, lkb <dig> acts through 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase  to phosphorylate myosin light chain  and lkb <dig> null mutant show similar disorganized actin as ampk null mutants. interestingly, the expression of a phospho-mimetic mutant of mlc was capable of rescuing the polarity defects seen in ampk-null flies implicating actin:myosin filament assembly as a major player downstream of lkb  <cit> . in agreement with this, the expression of strad, an activator of lkb <dig>  in mammalian epithelial cells promotes the assembly of an actin-rich brush border-like structure  <cit> .

given the importance of actin in lkb1-mediated polarity effects and given the importance of rho gtpases in actin filament assembly, we have looked for an interaction between lkb <dig> and rho gtpases. we introduced lkb <dig> into hela-s <dig> cells, which lack endogenous lkb <dig> and found that it promotes the assembly of actin filament bundles or stress fibers. these are characterized by their association with integrin-mediated focal adhesion complexes and by their dependence on rho kinase activity. lkb <dig> expression leads to an increase in the activation state of rho, and this is mediated by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, dbl. the overexpression of dbl has previously been shown to activate rho and cdc <dig>  but we found no evidence for cdc <dig> activation after lkb <dig> expression in hela-s <dig> cells. it is also interesting that the kinase activity of lkb <dig> is not required for the induction of stress fibers, although the kinase domain is. we do not know whether lkb <dig> interacts directly with dbl, or whether it is mediated through another protein. experimentally, constitutive activation of dbl can be achieved through deletion of the n-terminal  <dig> residues suggesting that the protein exists in an autoinhibitory state  <cit> . relieving autoinhibitory interactions is a common mechanism for activating rho family gefs; many have n-terminal sequences encoding recognizable binding sites for regulatory lipids or proteins. however, the mechanism by which dbl is physiologically activated is not known. it has been suggested that autoinhibition can be relieved through an interaction with ezrin, though it is not clear whether the interaction between ezrin and dbl is a cause or consequence of dbl activation  <cit> . our data suggest that autoinhibition of dbl may be relieved through binding of lkb <dig>  either directly or indirectly, to the catalytic dh/ph domain, rather than n-terminus.

interestingly, we found that when lkb <dig> is co-expressed with strad, the actin filaments coalesce into puncta associated with phosphorylated ezrin. these puncta are found on the dorsal surface of cells, somewhat reminiscent of the results reported earlier with strad expression in another epithelial cell line  <cit> . ezrin plays a major role in epithelial cells through its ability to act as a bridge linking actin filaments to the apical plasma membrane  <cit> . in addition phosphorylated ezrin has been reported to interact with dbl and activate rho in t-lymphoma cells  <cit> . in breast carcinoma cells, ezrin recruits and interacts with dbl at the plasma membrane, although in this case this results in activation of cdc <dig>  <cit> . we are currently exploring the relationship between ezrin, dbl and lkb <dig> in the context of epithelial morphogenesis.

CONCLUSIONS
we have found that lkb <dig> promotes actin filament assembly through an interaction with the rho exchange factor, dbl. we speculate that this may be an important pathway downstream of lkb <dig> in the establishment of cell polarity in epithelial cells. disruption of this rho pathway in cells of patients that lack lkb <dig> may disrupt the correct organization of actin:myosin filaments and have important consequences for the integrity of epithelial tissues.
