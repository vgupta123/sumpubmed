BACKGROUND
chinese bayberry is an important commercial horticultural crop. it has been cultivated for more than  <dig>  years in southern china, but is little known elsewhere. the production area is currently  <dig>  ha, with an annual production of  <dig>  million tons. the plant is diploid , generally dioecious, with the female plants cultivated for fruit
 <cit> , growing well on poor soils due to the association of nitrogen-fixing bacteria with the root system. it is rich in anthocyanins exhibiting a wide range of pharmacological properties, such as anti-inflammatory, antitumor and antioxidative effects
 <cit> .

there are four species within the genus myrica in china, namely myrica rubra sieb. & zucc., m. esculenta buch.-ham., m. nana cheval., and m. adenophora hance. m. rubra is widely distributed, with many local cultivars in the zhejiang, jiangsu, fujian and guangdong provinces and a few from guizhou, yunnan and hunan provinces. the best known cultivars are biqi and dongkui, both from the zhejiang province. although there are abundant germplasm resources, studies on genetics and breeding of the species are still in their infancy. molecular marker technology is a popular tool for breeding and genetic research, and with the construction of a genomic library,  <dig> polymorphic microsatellite loci have been developed in m. rubra <cit>  and  <dig> from an expressed sequence tag library
 <cit> . recently,  <dig> primer pairs have been temporarily developed by issr-suppression pcr
 <cit>  with gsg  <dig> as the primer for enriching microsatellite sequences. reports on the genetic diversity in chinese bayberry using ssr markers have also recently been published
 <cit> , but the number of markers for chinese bayberry is limited.

the reproducibility, multiallelicism, co-dominance, relative abundance and good genome coverage of ssr markers have made them one of the most useful tools for genetic diversity and linkage mapping. genomic ssrs and est-ssrs, considered complementary to plant genome mapping, have been reported in many fruit crops, such as walnut
 <cit> , cherry
 <cit> , apricot
 <cit>  and coconut
 <cit> . est-ssrs are useful for genetic analysis, but their relatively low polymorphism and the high possibility of no gene-rich regions in the genome are limitations to their use. in contrast, genomic ssrs are highly polymorphic and tend to be widely distributed throughout the genome, resulting in better map coverage
 <cit> .

with genetic maps serving as the basis for future positional gene cloning, making map-based cloning and marker-assisted selection possible, the development of more ssrs is essential. as sequencing technologies advance, whole-genome shotgun  sequences are becoming increasingly available. these dna sequences are valuable resources for ssr development in many plant species, such as rice
 <cit>  and papaya
 <cit> . in addition, they can be used to evaluate the frequency and distribution of different types of ssrs in the genome, and even help to estimate genome size and characters such as heterozygosis and repeats.

as a way of reducing the cost of genotyping research, schuelke
 <cit>  proposed a method for fluorescent dye labelling of pcr fragments with a sequence-specific forward primer: the universal fluorescent-labelled m <dig> primer, at the 5’ end, acts as the forward primer in a ‘one-tube’ reaction. as this method allows for high-throughput genetic analyses, with a high number of microsatellite markers widely used, we considered the possibility of using this approach for multiplex pcr, to improve the efficiency and save costs.

in this study, we mined and validated  <dig> ssr markers and describe their application for understanding the genetic relationship among  <dig> chinese bayberry accessions and other myrica species. these markers are useful for genotyping and genetic diversity analysis and linkage mapping of myrica rubra and other myrica species.

RESULTS
genome survey using whole genome shotgun data in chinese bayberry
wgs generated  <dig>   high quality sequence reads from two dna libraries  of the androphyte individual ‘c2010-55’. we used  <dig>  g raw data for k-mer analysis and heterozygous simulation. for the 17-mer frequency distribution , the peak of the depth distribution was about  <dig>  the estimated genome size was 323 mb, using the formula: genome size = k-mer count/peak of the kmer distribution. the minor peak at 1/ <dig> altitude of the main peak indicates the high level of heterozygosity in this genome . a total of  <dig>  contigs were assembled with a total sequence length of  <dig>  mb. the length of n <dig> was 295 bp in our assembly, and the longest contig and scaffold  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp, respectively.

frequency distribution of different types of ssr markers
a total of  <dig>  out of  <dig>  scaffolds  retrieved from the genome survey sequence contained  <dig>  ssrs , of which  <dig>  contained more than one ssr, and  <dig>  ssrs were present in compound format. among the derived ssr repeats, the di-nucleotide was the most abundant repeat, accounting for  <dig> % of total ssrs, followed by tri- , tetra- , penta- , and hexa-  nucleotides . there was a large proportion of both dinucleotides and trinucleotides while the rest amounted to less 2%. the average frequency of occurrence was about  <dig> % .

the ssr frequency of each motif is presented in additional file
 <dig>  the ssr motif consists of  <dig> types. among the repeat motifs of the dinucleotide, the ag/ct repeat was the most common, representing  <dig> %, followed by  <dig> % at repeats , and the predominant motifs of trinucleotide  repeats accounted for  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively .

polymorphism of ssr markers
we first designed and synthesised  <dig> ssr primer pairs from those scaffolds more than 2kb long. the majority of ssr loci were dinucleotide repeats , and the remainder trinucleotide. initially, the effectiveness of these primer pairs was detected in two cultivars  and m. cerifera through denaturing page , and  <dig>  of these were amplified successfully in biqi and dongkui, and  <dig>  in m. cerifera. the ssr loci  were identified as heterozygous loci either in biqi or in dongkui. subsequently, they were used to screen  <dig> accessions, and detected an average of  <dig>  alleles and from  <dig> to  <dig> alleles per locus .

the pic at each locus ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  with an average of  <dig>  loci. the pcr product size ranged from  <dig> to 274 bp. all the primers produced amplicons in agreement with the expected sizes. most of the ssr primers  showed significant deviation from hw equilibrium . partial correlation analysis showed that significant positive correlations existed between the repeat unit length and pic . this showed that these ssrs had high rates of transferability for m. adenophora  and m. nana  and low rates for m. cerifera , indicating that these markers are suitable for genetic diversity analyses in other myrica species.

one of the objectives of this study was to develop potential suitable ssr markers for genetic mapping using biqi and dongkui as crossing parents. we selected  <dig> heterozygous loci in biqi and  <dig> in dongkui :  <dig> primer pairs can be used together in linkage mapping of the planned f <dig> populations between biqi and dongkui.

genetic relationship analysis
the  <dig> accessions were divided into three groups , based on nei’s genetic distance coefficient
 <cit>  using upgma cluster analysis. the similarity among all the accessions varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> . at the species level, the upgma dendrogram produced clusters separating m. nana and m. cerifera into two distinct groups. the genetic similarity between m. cerifera and m. rubra was  <dig> , lower than the  <dig>  previously reported by xie
 <cit> . 

the main cluster ‘a’ included the subgroups a- <dig> and a- <dig>  subgroup a- <dig> includes  <dig> accessions, mainly from the cities of ningbo  and hangzhou , where the popular and dominant cultivar is biqi. this demonstrates that these natural elite seedling selections are truly distinct from the local cultivars. for their genetic relationships , the rare monoecious individual  is closely related to biqi, while the accessions ‘shuijing’ and ‘y2010-72’  are clearly separated in the cluster, with low genetic distance.

subgroup a- <dig> includes  <dig> accessions, with four from wenzhou, two from taizhou, and one each from the cities of hangzhou and ningbo, and the hunan, guangxi, guizhou and jiangsu provinces. this group includes the popular cultivar dongkui. the four accessions from wenzhou distributed in this cluster have genetic similarity. the accession ‘tongzimei’ from the hunan province is on an independent branch, showing that it is genetically distinct. ‘xiaolejiangchonghei’ and ‘m. adenophora’ grouped together, and are possibly in the same population. six androphyte accessions, distributed in group a, are close to cultivars of the same geographic origin.

the accessions ‘myrica nana’ from yunnan and ‘myrica cerifera’ from the usa were independently classified as the ‘b’ and ‘c’ group, indicating a distant relationship with cultivated myrica rubra.

discussion
our major aims were to find a large set of ssr markers for myrica rubra and understand the genetic diversity and relationship among representative cultivars, androphyate and related species. this research paves the way for constructing an ssr-based linkage map in myrica.

the genome characteristics of genusmyrica
shotgun sequencing is suitable for simple genomes, with no or few repeat sequences, such as chinese bayberry. for such genomes, the genome can largely be assembled simply by merging together reads containing overlapping sequence
 <cit> . we report the genome survey of chinese bayberry using whole genome shotgun sequencing. the 17-nucleotide depth distribution suggests a genome size of 323 mb, larger than peach , but close to our estimate of 250 mb from flow cytometry using rice as the reference . although the highly homozygous material was selected on a limited number of ssr loci assays, the actual heterozygous rate, as revealed by  <dig> new ssr markers, was very high . to overcome the key issue of heterozygosity and allow us to generate a high-quality genome sequence, we can use a unique homozygous form such as monoploid, derived using tissue culture or from nature and worth further study.

marker development for under-utilised fruit crops
ssrs have been widely used for high-throughput genotyping and map construction as they have the advantage of high abundance, random distribution within the genome, high polymorphism information content and stable co-dominance
 <cit> . they can be developed from either genomic or expressed sequence tag  libraries. although est-ssrs are useful for genetic analysis, their disadvantages of relatively low polymorphism and high concentration in gene-rich regions of the genome may limit their usage, especially for the construction of linkage maps
 <cit> . in this study, a total of  <dig> ssr primer pairs were designed from  <dig>  ssr sites, and  <dig>  primer pairs were effective. due to the self-complementary nature to form dimers, at/ta is not usually used to develop markers
 <cit> . our findings are in agreement with that published for peach, where the dinucleotide repeat motifs were also found to be the most common, and n as the most common repeat unit
 <cit> .

in the present study, the mean value of pic was higher than the previously reported  <dig> 
 <cit> , but the consistent relationship was observed between ssr polymorphism and repeat unit length. there are some reports of a positive relationship between degree of polymorphism and repeat unit length
 <cit> . however, those polymorphic ssrs that are homozygous in both parents cannot be mapped in f <dig> populations, although they are useful for mapping in f <dig> or backcross populations
 <cit> , while heterozygous ssrs can be used for mapping in f <dig> populations . the estimated number of ssrs that can be mapped in the f <dig> populations between biqi and dongkui was about 85%.

recently, based on mass sequence data of chinese bayberry obtained by rna-seq,  <dig>  unigenes were identified and approximately 80% of the unigenes  were annotated, which provides an excellent platform for future est-ssr development and functional genomic research
 <cit> .

high efficient test methods
normally, a universal m <dig> primer is labelled with one of a number of fluorescent dyes. the tailed primer provides a complementary sequence to the fluorescent labelled m <dig> primer, leading to the amplification of fluorescent pcr products, and then the pcr products of different sizes and/or labelled with different fluorescent dyes are mixed and tested
 <cit> . in this research, a multiplex pcr strategy was designed using the universal m13-tailed primer and three additional tail primers, designed arbitrarily, in presumed four-plex amplifications in single pcr, for a major reduction in cost and time. however, as only a few primer combinations were successful, most resulting in weak bands, we did the pcr individually and mixed the pcr products. further optimisation of multiplex pcr is needed to evaluate its general applicability.

evolution ofmyricaspecies
in this study, both cultivated species and wild species were analysed and their genetic diversity could easily be differentiated. m. nana and m. cerifera were clearly genetically distant to m. rubra. m. nana, also known as the dwarf or yunnan arbutus, is indigenous to the yunnan and guizhou provinces, and has a plant height of < 2 m. the juvenile period of fruit tree can be shortened for breeding purposes. studies on embryo culture in vitro of the f <dig> seeds of crosses between m. rubra and m. nana,
 <cit> , has shown good cross compatibility between m. rubra and m. nana, resulting in  <dig> % normal seeds with intact embryo. m. adenophora and m. nana grow as wild trees, with the fruit of m. adenophora only suitable for medical purposes and not edible.

our findings on the genetic similarity between m. adenophora and m. rubra, which are considered a progenitor-derivative species pair, are consistent with a previously published figure of  <dig> 
 <cit> . an earlier study observed little change in allelic diversity along the chronosequence and no evidence for heterosis, although there was a moderate change in genotypic diversity
 <cit> . the markers developed in this study can be very useful in future population structure analysis.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the genome size of myrica genus is small, about 320 mb. a large set of ssrs were developed from a genome survey of myrica rubra. the results suggest that they have high rates of transferability, making them suitable for use in other myrica species.

materials and methods
plant materials and genome survey
we selected an androphyte ‘c2010-55’ for the genome survey because it was the most homozygous  individual among  <dig> accessions. two dna libraries of  <dig> and 500 bp insert size were constructed and sequenced by illumina hi-seq  <dig> 

twenty-nine accessions of the cultivated species  and  <dig> related species , collected from different provinces in china , were used to evaluate the suitability of the ssrs for genetic distance analysis. young leaves were collected and frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to genomic dna extraction using ctab methods
 <cit> . dna concentrations were measured spectrophotometrically at 260 nm, and the extracts electrophoresed on 1% agarose to confirm the quality. the purified dnas were standardised at 40 ng/μl and stored at -40°c.

ssr identification and primer design
we used misa scripting language  to identify microsatellite repeats in our sequence database. the ssr loci containing perfect repeat units of 2- <dig> nucleotides only were considered. the minimum ssr length criteria were defined as six reiterations for dinucleotide, and five reiterations for other repeat units. mononucleotide repeats and complex ssr types were excluded from the study.

the ssr primers were designed using batchprimer <dig> interface modules . we selected  <dig> primers that met the following parameters: 110– <dig> final product length, primer size from  <dig> to 22 bp with an optimum size of 20 bp, and the annealing temperature was set at 60°c. the repeat units over eight were used.

tail- <dig>  tail- <dig>  tail- <dig> and tail- <dig> were added to the 5’ end of each  <dig> forward primers of pairs respectively. tail- <dig>  tail- <dig> and tail- <dig> were designed so that the primer size was 18 bp and the annealing temperature was 53°c. primers were synthesised by invitrogen trading  co., ltd. we primarily tested two cultivars  and m. cerifera for  <dig> ssr loci by page  to confirm their suitability. tail- <dig>  tail- <dig>  tail- <dig> and tail- <dig> labelled with one of the following dyes: ned, pet, fam, and hex, respectively.

polymerase chain reaction and gel electrophoresis
each 20 μl reaction mixture contained 10 × pcr buffer ,  <dig>  mm of each dntp,  <dig> pmol of each reverse,  <dig> pmol of the tail primer,  <dig> pmol of the forward primer,  <dig>  units of rtaq polymerase  and 40 ng genomic dna template. each primer pair had an interval of 20 bp according to the expected size of amplicons.

dna amplification was in an eppendorf mastercycler  programmed at 94°c for 5 min for initial denaturation, then  <dig> cycles at 94°c /58°c /72°c , followed by  <dig> cycles of 94°c /53°c /72°c . the final extension step was 10 min at 72°c. each pcr product was run on 1% agarose gel at 110 v for a quality check.

subsequently, pcr products were electrophoresed on 8% denaturing page, according to myers et al.
 <cit> , at 60 w in a sequi-gen gt nucleic acid electrophoresis cell  for 4 h, depending on the fragment sizes to be separated, and visualised by silver staining
 <cit> . genotypes showing one and two bands were scored as homozygous and heterozygous, respectively, and the results recorded and photographed.

multiplex pcr was designed and tested with products of different sizes and labelled with different fluorescent dyes. each 20 μl reaction mixture contained 10 × pcr buffer ,  <dig>  mm of each dntp,  <dig> unit of rtaq polymerase, 40 ng genomic dna template and a total of four primer pairs with  <dig> pmol of each reverse primer,  <dig> pmol of each tail primer, and  <dig> pmol of each forward primer. the pcr products were diluted, mixed with the internal size standard liz <dig>  and loaded on an abi  <dig> genetic analyzer. alleles were scored using genemapper version  <dig>  software .

data analysis
the raw genome sequence data was first filtered to obtain high quality reads, then assembled using soap  denovo software to contig, scaffold and fill in gaps. in addition, we used sspace software to build the scaffold. k-mer analysis was to help estimate the genome size and characters, such as heterozygosis and repeats.

the number of alleles , observed heterozygosity  and expected heterozygosity  were calculated using popgene version  <dig>  . chi-square test for hardy-weinberg equilibrium allele frequencies and polymorphism information content  was calculated using powermarker version  <dig> 
 <cit>  . microsoft office excel  <dig> was used to analyse the correlation. genetic similarity among all the accessions was calculated according to dice’s coefficients using nei's coefficient index
 <cit>  with the free tree  <dig> . <dig> 
 <cit>   software, and the dendrogram constructed using the unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic averaging  option. the confidence of branch support was then evaluated by bootstrap analysis with  <dig>  replicates. the dendrogram was printed using mega version  <dig>  software
 <cit>  .
