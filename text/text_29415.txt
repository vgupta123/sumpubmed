BACKGROUND
periodic spacing of a-tracts  with the dna helical period of ~10–11 bp is associated with intrinsic dna curvature  <cit> . in eukaryotes, this periodicity is a major component of the nucleosome positioning signal  <cit> . the dna sequence periodicity can influence properties of the chromatin and expression of the encoded genes. for example, the “hyperperiodic regions” of the caenorhabditis elegans genome are subject to particular types of histone modifications and contain mostly germ-line specific genes  <cit> .

strong periodic patterns with the characteristic period of ~10–11 bp were also detected in many prokaryotic genomes  <cit> . the biological role of the sequence periodicity and dna curvature in prokaryotes is not clear, although several possible roles or causes of the 10–11 bp periodicity have been proposed. zhurkin pointed out that a similar periodic signal can arise from amphipathic α-helices in proteins  <cit> . α-helices feature a helical period of about  <dig>  residues per turn, which in dna translates to an ~ <dig>  bp period. however, presence of the periodic patterns in both protein-coding and noncoding regions, as well as the extent of the periodicity beyond distances typical of α-helix lengths suggest that the sequence periodicity related to α-helices in proteins is not the only cause of the observed strong periodic signal in prokaryotic dna  <cit> . dna bending affects dna-protein interactions and curved dna segments are often associated with promoters, where they can influence interactions between dna and transcription factors  <cit> . the sequence periodicity could also promote a particular mode of supercoiling: herzel and coworkers proposed that ~11 bp periodicity found in most bacteria can relate to predominant negative supercoiling whereas ~10 bp periodicity of some archaeal genomes could promote positive supercoiling  <cit> . tolstorukov and coworkers analyzed clusters of periodically spaced. a-tracts in e. coli and other bacterial genomes, and proffered a hypothesis that the sequence periodicity-driven intrinsically curved segments contribute to the formation and stability of supercoiled dna loops that constitute bacterial nucleoid  <cit> . it is possible that the dna sequence periodicity in prokaryotes can play multiple roles, including facilitating transcription initiation, contributing to dna folding in the nucleoid, and promoting positive or negative supercoiling, but most likely to different extent in different genomes.

whereas earlier works focused on measuring the predominant period in a whole genome, we recently developed a technique that allows comparing the intensity of the periodic signal among different genomes or different regions of the same genome  <cit> . comparisons among more than  <dig> prokaryotic chromosomes revealed major differences in the intensity of the periodic signal among different genomes as well as varying levels of intrachromosomal heterogeneity  <cit> . in most prokaryotic chromosomes, a strong dna curvature-related periodicity is restricted to short chromosomal segments. by contrast, some genomes feature a persistently strong periodic signal covering majority of the chromosome length. finally, some genomes exhibit hardly any periodic signal at all. we attributed the differences to presumed organism-specific differences in nucleoid structure and also noted that intrachromosomal heterogeneity could be related to differences in gene expression in different sections of the chromosome  <cit> . we now extended the analysis of dna curvature-related sequence periodicity in prokaryotes to large bacteriophages. comparisons with chromosomal dna indicate that phages generally lack a strong periodic signal. moreover, chromosomes that contain prophages tend to have weaker or less persistent sequence periodicity, suggesting that the periodicity and concomitant dna curvature could also play a role in protecting the chromosome from phage integration.

RESULTS
strong periodic signals found in prokaryotic chromosomes are absent in bacteriophages
the distribution of the intensity of dna curvature-related periodic signal in sequences of  <dig> prokaryotic chromosomes and  <dig> large phages  is shown in figure  <dig>  top panel. the signal intensity is measured by the maxq* index . there is a clear distinction between chromosomes and phages in terms of sequence periodicity, with phages exhibiting lower maxq* values. comparisons among random sequences show that the differences between chromosomes and phages are not a simple consequence of differences in sequence lengths, as both randomized phage and chromosome sequences occupy approximately the same range of maxq* . in a separate test, we compared the  <dig> phages in our dataset with genome sizes between  <dig> and 200 kb with a collection of randomly selected chromosomal segments with lengths in the same 50–200 kb range. one such segment was extracted from each of the  <dig> chromosomes. the mean maxq* for phages was  <dig>  compared to  <dig>  in the random chromosomal segments of similar sizes. the difference is significant with p =  <dig>  by the mann–whitney u-test, confirming that the differences between the phages and chromosomes cannot be explained solely by different genome sizes.

phage dna undergoes processes that do not apply to chromosomal dna, most importantly packaging in the capsid. while different viruses utilize different dna packaging mechanisms, one common aspect is the spatial constraint of the capsid interior. to satisfy the spatial constraints, the dna is wrapped in rather regular tight loops that minimize the bending stress on the dna molecule  <cit> . extensive intrinsic dna bending could increase the stress from structural deformation imposed by tight dna packaging and the constraints related to dna packaging represent one possible scenario to explain the absence of strong sequence periodicity found in chromosomal dna.

chromosomes with a persistent periodic signal are less likely to contain prophages
the observation that phage genomes lack the dna curvature-related sequence periodicity led us to investigate whether there is any relationship between the sequence periodicity and presence or absence of prophages in a chromosome. of  <dig> chromosomal sequences surveyed by prophinder  <cit> ,  <dig>  were predicted to contain at least one integrated prophage, while the remaining  <dig> contained no predicted prophages. some prokaryotic chromosomes contain exceptionally persistent periodic signals throughout the chromosome  <cit> , here defined as having a maxmax score ≥  <dig>   <dig> of  <dig>  chromosomes with no prophages possessed exceptionally persistent periodic signals compared with  <dig> out of  <dig>  sequences with at least one integrated prophage. this difference is statistically significant  and indicates an increased likelihood that a genome with persistent periodic signal does not contain a prophage.

the significant relationship between the sequence periodicity and presence or absence of a prophage in a chromosome was further confirmed by comparisons of the values of max <dig>  max <dig>  and maxmax indices between the chromosomes with and without prophages using the mann–whitney u test . the max <dig>  max <dig>  and maxmax indices represent different ways to measure the persistency of a dominant periodic signal throughout a chromosome . to reduce a possible bias from inclusion of multiple strains of the same or closely related species we selected randomly only one strain of each species for the statistical test, and repeated the test  <dig> times. for max <dig> and maxmax indices, all  <dig> tests confirmed a significant difference between prophage-containing and prophage-lacking chromosomes , whereas  <dig> of the  <dig> tests yielded a significant difference in max <dig> values .

a we used a technique similar to the bootstrap test to reduce the data bias towards model organisms, which often have multiple sequenced strains of the same species. a single genome was randomly selected to represent each species in our dataset while all other genomes of the same species  were excluded from the subsequent analysis. the resulting dataset was divided into two groups based on whether the chromosome contained a prophage or not. the max <dig>  max <dig>  and maxmax indices in both groups were subsequently compared using the mann–whitney test. the test was repeated  <dig> times with different random selections of representative genomes. the table shows the number of tests that led to rejecting the null hypothesis when using a standard 5% probability cutoff.

a visual demonstration of the difference between chromosomes with and without prophages in terms of persistency of the sequence periodicity is provided in figure  <dig>  chromosomes with high maxmax values generally do not contain prophages. the plots in figure  <dig> also show that the chromosomes with one or more prophage tend to be larger than those with no prophages, and that no prophages were detected in genomes with extremely low gc content .

these results lead us to speculate that the sequence periodicity and dna curvature in prokaryotic chromosomes could play a role in protecting the genomic dna from phage integration. tolstorukov and coworkers  <cit>  hypothesized that curved dna segments in bacterial chromosomes promote nucleoid compaction and increase the stability of the dna complexes with architectural proteins. our subsequent analysis of sequence periodicity in prokaryotic chromosomes showed that most prokaryotic chromosomes contain alternating segments of strong and weak periodicity. we hypothesized that the heterogeneity of sequence periodicity could reflect structural heterogeneity of the nucleoid, where more structurally stable  sections characterized by strong sequence periodicity alternate with less stable  segments characterized by weak periodicity  <cit> . it is possible that rigid sections of the nucleoid are less susceptible to phage integration, and chromosomes with persistent sequence periodicity are  protected from phage integration. this notion is also consistent with our earlier finding that highly expressed genes tend to be located in non-periodic  segments of the chromosome  <cit> , as both transcription and phage integration likely require local unfolding of the nucleoid structure.

integration of multiple prophages could also in some cases decrease the persistency of the periodic signal in a chromosome because, as we demonstrated above, phages tend to lack the sequence periodicity. integrated prophages can comprise up to 10–20% of the chromosome size  <cit> , and additions of such an amount of non-periodic dna into a chromosome with otherwise persistent sequence periodicity could decrease the values of the max <dig>  max <dig>  and maxmax indices. however, this mechanism applies only to chromosomes with very high prophage content as integration of only a few prophages would have little effect on our measures of the persistency of the periodic signal.

intragenomic heterogeneity of sequence periodicity may affect the prophage integration sites
there are a few chromosomal sequences that do not fit the general pattern described above and contain a predicted prophage despite exhibiting a relatively persistent a-tract periodicity. we investigated the interplay of sequence periodicity and phage integration in the genomes of mycoplasma hyopneumoniae j  and campylobacter curvus  <dig>  , which contain one prophage each according to the prophinder search .

m. hyopneumoniae j possesses a remarkably strong and persistent periodic signal with the dominant period  <dig>  bp, which spans almost the entire genome and features only few non-periodic regions  <cit> . one such region  features a signal with a period 12–13 bp, but lacks the periodicity typically associated with dna curvature . in particular, this region lacks the ~ <dig>  bp periodicity, which is characteristic of the bulk of the chromosome . furthermore, this region coincides with the insertion site of a predicted prophage at position  <dig> – <dig>  bp. the c. curvus  <dig>  chromosome also possesses a strong and relatively persistent periodic signal with a predominant period ~ <dig>  bp. a predicted prophage resides at position  <dig> ,093– <dig> ,803 bp, which is located in a segment that lacks the periodicity characteristic of the bulk of the chromosome .

in the previous work, we proffered that the bacterial nucleoid consists of a mosaic of dna loops with strong sequence periodicity indicative of a more rigid conformation and regions of weaker periodicity, which likely confers a more flexible loop configuration  <cit> . we have also shown that highly expressed genes tend to be localized in regions of weak periodicity. we hypothesize that phages may prefer integrating in structurally more flexible regions of the chromosomes characterized by lower content of intrinsically bent dna, a weak sequence periodicity, and probably higher transcriptional activity.

CONCLUSIONS
several possible roles were proposed for dna curvature and concomitant sequence periodicity in prokaryotes but its exact biological function is not well understood. our comparisons of the a-tract periodicity between prokaryotic chromosomes and phages suggests that the dna curvature could help protect the chromosomes from phage integration, most likely as a consequence of its contribution to nucleoid compaction.
