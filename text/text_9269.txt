BACKGROUND
histoplasma capsulatum is a heterothallic ascomycete fungus requiring two mating types, phenotypically described as  and , to undergo mating  <cit> . organisms of  mating type have the mat1- <dig> idiomorph of the mating locus, while organisms of  mating type have the mat1- <dig> idiomorph of the mating locus  <cit> . the fungus is pathogenic, and organisms of  mating type may be associated with increased virulence. the organism causes acute pulmonary disease when inhaled into the lung  <cit> . individuals may also develop the disseminated form of the disease, which is usually controlled by activation of cell-mediated immunity in immune-competent individuals  <cit> . organisms of  mating type are found more frequently in samples from patients with pulmonary histoplasmosis; however, organisms of both mating types are represented equally in samples from patients with severe disseminated histoplasmosis and in environmental samples  <cit> . it is unknown whether the  mating type strain predominates in clinical samples due to host factors, or differences between organisms of opposite mating type. a single study examining virulence of  and  mating type strains has been reported; however, interpretation is limited by the inability to compare congenic strains of h. capsulatum  <cit> . mating occurs under appropriate conditions in the mycelial phase when hyphae arising from organisms of opposite mating type appose and generate a complex structure comprising of a net of short branching hyphae covered with coiled surface hyphae. within this specialized closed structure, the cleistothecium, cytoplasmic and nuclear fusion occur followed by successive rounds of meiosis and mitosis generating sac-like asci containing  <dig> ascospores, the end-product of sexual replication.

generation of congenic strains in h. capsulatum is challenging due to the low frequency of homologous gene targeting in the organism  <cit> , and because the organism rapidly loses mating ability in culture  <cit> . this limits the feasibility of gene replacement or backcrossing as methods for generating congenic strains. if the loss of mating competency could be overcome in laboratory strains of h. capsulatum, a variety of classical genetics techniques could be developed for use in this organism, including congenic strain construction. understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate mating could lead to the restoration of mating ability in laboratory strains of h. capsulatum. through this work, we generated a strain of h. capsulatum that can be used to examine molecular correlates of mating.

regulation of mating in fungi requires integration of multiple pathways in a complex developmental program. the pheromone response map kinase pathway is a central pathway in the mating response of many fungi  <cit> . in the model fungus saccharomyces cerevisiae, this pathway allows yeasts to sense a mating partner, and coordinates appropriate responses such as g <dig> arrest  <cit> . map kinase pathways homologous to the pheromone response map kinase pathway have been identified in several fungi including candida albicans  <cit> , neurospora crassa  <cit> , and paracoccidiodes brasiliensis  <cit> . there is also evidence in s. cerevisiae for a functional link between the pheromone response map kinase pathway and the map kinase pathway involved in cell wall integrity, as s. cerevisiae strains lacking the map kinase slt <dig> die after exposure to pheromone  <cit> . transcription factors present at the mating locus are additional regulators of mating in fungi such as cryptococcus neoformans and c. albicans  <cit> . the mat1-1- <dig> and mat1-2- <dig> transcription factors of h. capsulatum have previously been shown to be transcriptionally responsive to conditioned media enriched for pheromone  <cit> , indicating that these transcription factors play a role in the mating process of h. capsulatum as well.

we generated a laboratory strain, uc <dig>  which was capable of forming empty cleistothecia when paired with a fresh clinical strain of opposite mating type. unlike other strains of h. capsulatum, uc <dig> did not lose the ability to form cleistothecia over time. we hypothesized that understanding how uc <dig> gained the ability to form cleistothecia would explain how h. capsulatum strains lose the ability to mate over time. we sought to determine how uc <dig> gained the ability to form cleistothecia, and then determined that uc <dig> could be used to identify molecular events contributing to cleistothecia production in h. capsulatum. h. capsulatum is a dimorphic fungus, growing in the yeast phase at 37°c and in mycelial phase at room temperature. because mating occurs in the mycelial phase, these studies were performed using organisms growing in the mycelial phase.

the uc <dig> strain was originally generated by agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation and integration of the t-dna region from the vector pcb301-gfp-hyg into the strain g217b  <cit> . the strain g217b was isolated in  <dig>  <cit> , has been extensively passaged in the laboratory, and is itself unable to form cleistothecia. the uc <dig> strain, derived by transformation of the g217b strain, is thought to have gained the ability to produce empty cleistothecia due to a combination of the transformation procedure itself, and the site of t-dna integration. we used the uc <dig> strain to study cleistothecia formation by searching for differences between uc <dig> and its parent g217b, and we determined that the h. capsulatum homolog of protein kinase c  plays a role in cleistothecia formation.

RESULTS
characterization of cleistothecia-like structures formed by uc <dig> and uh3
the strain uc <dig> formed cleistothecia when paired with the fresh clinical strain uh <dig>  cleistothecia were visible to the naked eye at the periphery of the colony when mycelial scrapings of each strain were co-incubated on a-yem agarose at room temperature for one month. at 400-500×, the net-like hyphae forming the cleistothecia were visible, as were characteristic coiling hyphae radiating from the cleistothecia . these structures were not observed when uh <dig> was crossed with g217b, the parent strain of uc <dig>  uc <dig> formed cleistothecia-like structures in greater than 90% of confrontation assays within  <dig> weeks when paired with mat1- <dig> clinical strains passaged for less than  <dig> months. uc <dig> maintained the ability to form cleistothecia for more than  <dig> years after generation of the strain from strain g217b. no cleistothecia were formed when uh <dig> and uc <dig> were paired with uh <dig> and va <dig>  respectively, two clinical strains that had been passaged for several months in the laboratory, consistent with previous reports that loss of mating competence occurred after 5- <dig> months of continuous passage. the exact timing of the loss of mating competence of h. capsulatum g217b is unknown as the strain was first reported in  <dig> and has been maintained in culture since then. nutrient limiting media was required for cleistothecia formation, as uc <dig> and uh <dig> did not form cleistothecia on nutrient-rich hmm.

cleistothecia were partially dissected to determine whether asci, containing ascospores, had been produced by the crosses. the cleistothecia appeared empty, as no clusters of club-shaped asci were visible by light microscopy  or scanning electron microscopy   when structures were teased apart prior to visualization. only what appear to be microconidia were observed by sem when cleistothecia-like structures were dissected . alpha projections of z-stacks taken by confocal microscopy also showed no evidence of asci . additionally uh3-blast, a blasticidin resistant strain of uh <dig> was generated and crossed with uc <dig>  cleistothecia from this cross were dissected and transferred to plates containing hygromycin and blasticidin, where no growth was observed after several weeks. these results indicate that while the strain uc <dig> can form empty cleistothecia, it is unable to complete the mating process by producing asci and ascospores.

molecular comparison of uc <dig> and g217b
to determine molecular correlates of the ability to form cleistothecia, rna levels of gene products predicted to be involved in mating  were analyzed in uc <dig> and g217b. differences in expression of these genes could suggest the mechanism behind uc1's ability to form empty cleistothecia. genes analyzed included the mating locus transcription factor mat1-1- <dig> <cit> , a putative alpha pheromone , and a putative fus3/kss <dig> homolog, histoplasma map kinase- <dig> . rna levels of mat1-1- <dig> were undetectable in mycelial samples of g217b, but were elevated in uc <dig> . rna levels of ppg <dig> were also elevated in uc <dig> compared to g217b . in contrast, rna levels of hmk <dig> were similar in uc <dig> and g217b . rna levels of ste <dig> and ste <dig>  putative alpha and a pheromone receptors respectively, were also analyzed in uc <dig> and g217b. ste <dig> and ste <dig> were detectable in mycelial samples of uc <dig>  while only ste <dig> was detectable in mycelial samples of g217b . these results indicated that higher levels of mat1-1- <dig> and ppg <dig> as well as differences in expression of pheromone receptors might contribute to the ability of uc <dig> to form empty cleistothecia.

contribution of hygromycin phosphotransferase to cleistothecial formation
a series of experiments were performed to determine why rna levels of genes involved in mating were increased in uc <dig>  and to determine whether this had caused the strain's ability to form empty cleistothecia. the strain uc <dig> was generated by integrating t-dna from the vector pcb301-gfp-hyg into the genome of the strain g217b by agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation  <cit> . uc <dig> could have gained the ability to produce empty cleistothecia due to the site of t-dna integration, or due to elements present within the t-dna region itself. the effects of hygromycin phosphotransferase  gene expression from within the t-dna region were investigated first, because hph activity has previously been associated with increased virulence in the strain uc <dig>  <cit> . to determine whether hph expression was responsible for cleistothecia production by uc <dig>  cleistothecia production was tested using the strain uc <dig>  uc <dig> is a derivative of uc <dig> in which the hph gene has been excised from the integrated t-dna region by cre-mediated recombination  <cit> . rna levels of mat1-1- <dig> and ppg <dig> were still increased in uc <dig> compared to g217b . uc <dig> also still formed empty cleistothecia when paired with uh <dig> , indicating that hph expression is not necessary for cleistothecia production by uc <dig> 

effects of t-dna insertion on genes flanking site of integration
expression patterns of genes flanking the site of t-dna integration may have been altered in uc <dig> due to the insertion, and this might be responsible for the differences between uc <dig> and g217b. effects of the site of t-dna integration were analyzed in uc <dig> to investigate the cause of the differences between uc <dig> and g217b. it has previously been determined that the t-dna is integrated upstream of hcag  <dig> in the strain uc <dig>  <cit> . hcag  <dig> shares sequence similarity with the s. cerevisiae bem <dig> protein, a scaffold protein involved in polarity and also in the pheromone response map kinase pathway. rna levels of putative bem <dig> and of hcag  <dig>  the two genes flanking the site of t-dna integration, were analyzed. rna levels of hcag  <dig> were undetectable in g217b and in uc <dig>  rna levels of bem <dig> were increased in yeast phase uc <dig> and uc <dig> compared to g217b . in mycelial phase organisms, when cleistothecia formation occurs, levels of bem <dig> were increased in uc <dig> compared to g217b, but decreased in uc <dig> compared to g217b . these results indicate that expression of the genes immediately flanking the t-dna insertion site is not likely to be responsible for the ability of uc <dig> and uc <dig> to form empty cleistothecia.

effects of t-dna insertion site on cleistothecia formation
to further explore the contribution of the site of t-dna integration to the ability of uc <dig> to form cleistothecia, additional strains were generated with the same t-dna sequence integrated elsewhere in the genome. if the site of t-dna integration plays a major role in uc1's ability to form empty cleistothecia, then strains with the same t-dna region integrated elsewhere in the genome would not be expected to form cleistothecia. if elements present within the t-dna region are responsible for uc1's ability to form empty cleistothecia, then strains with the same t-dna region integrated elsewhere in the genome would still be able to form cleistothecia.

to distinguish effects of the site of t-dna integration on cleistothecia production from effects due to elements present within the t-dna region itself, four additional strains were generated in the g217b background: alt <dig>  alt <dig>  alt <dig>  and alt <dig>  these were generated by random integration of t-dna from the same vector, pcb301-gfp-hyg, into alternative locations in the genome of g217b by agrobacterium-mediated transformation. the site of agrobacterium-mediated integration has previously been shown to be random in h. capsulatum  <cit> . rna levels of mat1-1- <dig>  ppg <dig>  and bem <dig> were analyzed in these strains and compared to those of g217b, uc <dig>  and uc <dig>  rna levels of mat1-1- <dig> and ppg <dig> in strains alt <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were comparable to those of uc <dig> . however, the strains alt <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were unable to produce cleistothecia when paired with uh <dig>  these results indicate that the site of integration may play a role in the ability of uc <dig> and uc <dig> to form empty cleistothecia. this effect is independent of the increased mat1-1- <dig> and ppg <dig> rna levels in these strains, which may be due to elements within the t-dna region or to the agrobacterium transformation process itself.

effects of hph expression on mat1-1- <dig> and ppg <dig> rna levels
while hph expression is not necessary for empty cleistothecia production by uc <dig>  it could be responsible for the increased rna levels of mat1-1- <dig> and ppg <dig> observed in strains that contain the hph gene within the t-dna region. to determine the effects of hph on rna levels of mat1-1- <dig> and ppg <dig> in the strain alt <dig>  hph was excised from the integrated t-dna region in this strain by cre-mediated recombination. mat1-1- <dig> and ppg <dig> rna levels were decreased in the two cre strains tested compared to uc <dig> and the original alt <dig> strain . this indicates that the increase in mat1-1- <dig> and ppg <dig> rna levels is partly due to the presence of hph in the integrated t-dna region; however, this is not sufficient to induce cleistothecia production in the alt strains.

effects of agrobacterium-mediated transformation on mat1-1- <dig> and ppg <dig> rna levels
since integration of the t-dna region from pcb301-gfp-hyg into the genome is associated with increased rna levels of mat1-1- <dig> and ppg <dig> regardless of the presence or absence of hph expression, it was thought that the agrobacterium-mediated transformation process itself could be affecting the expression levels of mat1-1- <dig> and ppg <dig>  to further delineate the effects of agrobacterium-mediated vector integration on rna levels of mat1-1- <dig>  ppg <dig> and bem <dig>  two additional strains were generated in the g217b background: g217b-blast <dig> and g217b-blast <dig>  these were generated by random integration of the t-dna region from a different vector, pcb301-blast, into the strain g217b by agrobacterium-mediated transformation. rna levels of mat1-1- <dig> and ppg <dig> were elevated in g217b-blast <dig> and  <dig> compared to g217b, but levels were not elevated to those found in uc <dig> . rna levels of bem <dig> were similar between g217b-blast <dig> and  <dig>  and g217b . these results indicate that increased mat1-1- <dig> and ppg <dig> rna levels in uc <dig> and uc <dig> may be partially due to the agrobacterium-mediated transformation process, but again, these increases alone are not sufficient to induce cleistothecia production in the g217-blast strains.

overexpression of mat1-1- <dig> and bem <dig> in g217b
since strains that are capable of cleistothecia formation exhibited higher rna levels of mat1-1- <dig>  it was thought that increased expression of this gene could be contributing to cleistothecia production. to determine the effects of increased levels of mat1-1- <dig> expression on cleistothecia formation, the gene was overexpressed in g217b using the vector psk-tel-kan-hyg. bem <dig> was similarly overexpressed in g217b to further assess its role in cleistothecia formation. an irrelevant protein, kusabira orange, was expressed in uh <dig> to provide a hygromycin-resistant mating partner. proteins of the appropriate size were visible by western blot of protein extracted from strains overexpressing bem <dig> or mat1-1- <dig>  and then probed with anti-c-myc antibody . a uh3-kusabira orange strain was crossed with g217b-bem1* and g217b-mat1* strains on a-yem agarose containing hygromycin. no cleistothecia were observed after several months; however, the strains grew slowly on a-yem with the addition of hygromycin. predictably, mat1-1- <dig> rna levels were increased in the strain overexpressing mat1-1- <dig> . rna levels of ppg <dig> in this strain were also increased compared to levels in g217b, but not to the levels observed in uc <dig> . rna levels of mat1-1- <dig> were barely detectable in the strain overexpressing bem <dig> , but rna levels of ppg <dig> in this strain were elevated compared to levels in g217b . these results indicated that increases in mat1-1- <dig> or bem <dig> alone are not sufficient to induce cleistothecia production; however, the hygromycin present in the media may have inhibited cleistothecia production by inhibiting the growth of the organisms.

uc <dig> as a tool to study cleistothecia formation
although the precise mechanisms by which uc <dig> gained the ability to form empty cleistothecia remained unclear, the strain provides an opportunity to study cleistothecia production in h. capsulatum. since the pheromone response map kinase pathway plays a central role in the mating response of s. cerevisiae  <cit> , it was predicted to play a similar role in the mating response of h. capsulatum. hmk <dig>  a putative fus3/kss <dig> homolog, was silenced in uc <dig> to determine the role of the pheromone response pathway in cleistothecia formation of this strain. hmk <dig> rna levels were reduced to 25% of the levels found in a control strain . silencing hmk <dig> had no effect on cleistothecia production when uc <dig> was paired with uh <dig> . this indicates that either the pheromone response pathway is not involved in formation of cleistothecia, or that low levels of hmk <dig> are still sufficient to support cleistothecia formation. alternatively, the mechanisms that restored cleistothecia production in this strain could be suppressing the effects of silencing hmk <dig> 

to identify additional differences between uc <dig> and g217b that could play a role in cleistothecia formation, microarray analysis was performed comparing mycelial samples of uc <dig> and g217b. uc <dig> was used as the comparator to eliminate the differences attributable to hph activity. seven hundred and forty one predicted transcripts demonstrated greater than three-fold altered expression in uc <dig> compared to g217b. four hundred and thirty four transcripts were upregulated in uc <dig> compared to g217b while three hundred and nine transcripts were downregulated. using blast2go for blast analysis and assignment of functional annotation and gene ontology, no specific patterns of biological processes could be discerned between up- or downregulated genes . among genes with assigned molecular functions, genes associated with protein modification or gene regulation, such as transferases and phosphatases, accounted for 37% of downregulated genes in uc <dig> compared to g217b consistent with the suggestion that no single function results in the acquisition of the ability to form empty cleistothecia.

protein kinase c  levels were found to be increased  <dig> -fold in uc <dig> compared to g217b . the elevation on pkc <dig> rna levels identified by microarray analysis was verified by qrt-pcr in both uc <dig> and uc <dig> compared to g217b . pkc <dig> rna levels in three of the four strains with t-dna from the vector pcb301-gfp-hyg integrated at alternate sites were similar to those of g217b . to determine whether the increased pkc <dig> gene expression resulted in increased protein levels of pkc <dig>  cytosolic pkc <dig> was measured in mycelial cell lysates of g217b, uc <dig>  and uc <dig>  higher levels of pkc <dig> activity were measured in activated cell lysates of uc <dig> and uc <dig> compared to g217b . this indicated that increased levels of pkc <dig> in uc <dig> and uc <dig> may be contributing to the ability of these organisms to form empty cleistothecia.

to further explore the association between increased pkc <dig> levels and cleistothecia formation in h. capsulatum, pkc <dig> activity of uc <dig> and uc <dig> was inhibited by chelerythrine chloride to establish a link between pkc <dig> activity and the mating pathway. as previously mentioned, rna levels of ppg <dig> are elevated in uc <dig> compared to g217b. following exposure to  <dig> μm chelerythrine chloride, ppg <dig> rna levels decreased in both uc <dig> and uc <dig> . these results indicate a link between pkc <dig> activity and pheromone production in uc <dig> and uc <dig> 

discussion
loss of mating ability with continuous culture is not a phenomenon limited to h. capsulatum. strains of blastomyces dermatitidis  <cit>  and c. neoformans  <cit>  are also reported to lose mating competency with continuous culture. in one study, mating ability of c. neoformans decreased 67% after  <dig> mitotic generations  <cit> . loss of mating ability in cultured fungal organisms may be due to accumulation of mutations in genes that either regulate or are required for mating. the rate of spontaneous mutation has been correlated with loss of mating ability in c. neoformans  <cit> . it has been hypothesized that defects in the a. fumigatus mat1-2- <dig> regulatory region have led to defects in mating ability of the organism <cit> , however a. fumigatus has recently been shown to be mating competent under certain conditions  <cit> . the fact that uc <dig> gained the ability to form empty cleistothecia after a single integrative transformation event indicates that this is an unlikely explanation; however, mutation rates of genes involved in mating have not been analyzed as h. capsulatum strains are cultured. this study also did not address the possibility that uc <dig> gained the ability to form empty cleistothecia due to unidentified genomic rearrangement resulting from the transformation process.

alternative explanations for loss of mating ability in h. capsulatum strains are suggested by the microarray study comparing uc <dig> and g217b. one possibility is that epigenetic effects play a role in the loss of mating ability demonstrated by h. capsulatum strains over time. c. albicans white cells switch to the mating-competent opaque form at a higher frequency after being exposed to trichostatin a , a histone deacetylase inhibitor  <cit> . pre-exposure of g217b to tsa for  <dig> hours does not induce mating ability . the ku proteins, involved in telomeric silencing  <cit> , have also been demonstrated to bind to sites of internal loci and facilitate silencing  <cit> . ku <dig> rna levels were found to be decreased 3-fold in uc <dig> compared to g217b by microarray . this raises the possibility that the g217b strain may contain genes involved in mating or regulation of mating that have been silenced; however, further verification and studies are required in this area.

another possibility, suggested by pigmentation observed in the strains studied and supported by the microarray study, is that camp levels affect mating competency. the uc <dig> strain appears more pigmented on hmm plates at room temperature than the g217b strain . it has previously been reported that h. capsulatum strains lose pigmentation in addition to losing mating ability in culture, and the loss of pigmentation can be used to infer loss of mating competency, through unknown mechanisms  <cit> . two putative tyrosinase genes were upregulated in uc <dig> compared to g217b by microarray . this may indicate a link between camp levels and mating competency. camp levels have been shown to regulate melanin production in fungi such as c. neoformans, where high camp levels stimulate melanin production  <cit> , and ustilago hordei, where high camp levels inhibit melanin production  <cit> . high camp levels lead to the activation of pka  <cit> . this pathway has been implicated in control of mating in s. cerevesiae, where increased pka activity inhibits sporulation,  <cit>  and impaired pka activity leads to sporulation even under nutrient-rich conditions that would normally inhibit sporulation  <cit> .

further comparison of uc <dig> and g217b, as well as further verification of the microarray data presented here may uncover a molecular mechanism that explains the loss of mating ability in h. capsulatum. additionally, the strain uc <dig> can be used to study cleistothecia formation in h. capsulatum. the cleistothecia formed by the pairing of uc <dig> and uh <dig> appear empty. we were unable to detect the presence of asci or ascospores inside the cleistothecia, indicating that the mating process was arrested at some point. the strain uc <dig> is, therefore, unable to complete the mating process in spite of its ability to form cleistothecia. uc <dig> does not, however, lose the ability to form empty cleistothecia over time in culture, making it a unique strain that is well suited for studying the molecular and morphological stages of cleistothecia formation.

at this time, it is unclear whether or not hyphal fusion can occur between uc <dig> and uh <dig>  it is thought that hyphal fusion precedes cleistothecia formation during normal mating in h. capsulatum  <cit> , but hyphal fusion may or may not be required for the formation of coiling and branching peridial hyphae comprising the outer structure of the cleistothecia. it is, therefore, unknown at what point the mating process is arrested during the uc1/uh <dig> cross. the property of the strain uc <dig> to form empty cleistothecia when crossed with a freshly isolated mat1- <dig> strain affords the opportunity to dissect the relationship between hyphal fusion and the formation of the outer cleistothecia structure, as well as the contribution of each strain to the mating structure. although uc <dig> contains a functional gfp gene, its expression is under control of the calcium binding protein gene promoter and is therefore limited to expression in yeast phase organisms. because mating occurs in the mycelial phase, an additional derivative of uc <dig> expressing a fluorescent marker in the mycelial phase would need to be generated to answer these questions.

there is no clear pattern of pheromone and pheromone receptor expression under standard growth conditions in the h. capsulatum strains studied here. in s. cerevisiae, mata strains secrete a pheromone and express the alpha pheromone receptor ste <dig>  while matalpha strains secrete alpha pheromone and express the a pheromone receptor ste <dig>  <cit> . there are also, however, examples of fungi such as neurospora crassa in which both pheromone receptors are constitutively expressed  <cit> . in the current study, ste <dig> rna levels were elevated in the established laboratory strain g217b, while ste <dig> levels were undetectable. the fact that ste <dig> but not ste <dig> is detected in g217b would indicate that organisms of mat1- <dig> mating type are responsive to alpha pheromone. this would confirm previous studies, which showed mat1-1- <dig> rna levels in a clinical h. capsulatum strain were responsive to an extract enriched for alpha pheromone  <cit> . if mat1- <dig> strains respond to alpha pheromone, they would be expected to produce a pheromone. however uc <dig>  the strain capable of empty cleistothecia formation, produces elevated rna levels of alpha pheromone. the a pheromone gene has yet to be identified in h. capsulatum.

rna levels of both ste <dig> and ste <dig> are also detectable in uc <dig>  in a. fumigatus, strains of both mating types also express alpha pheromone and both pheromone receptors under a variety of conditions  <cit> . it may be that the correct combination of stimulation and growth conditions is required in these organisms to observe only one pheromone and pheromone receptor expressed exclusively in each organism of opposite mating type. incorrect expression of pheromone receptors has been shown to affect mating ability in s. cerevisiae, as mata cells also expressing a pheromone receptor do not undergo g <dig> arrest when exposed to alpha pheromone  <cit> . as pheromone receptor expression patterns differ between g217b and uc <dig>  this could play a role in uc1's ability to form empty cleistothecia, or in uc1's inability to form ascospores.

both rna and cytosolic protein levels of pkc <dig> are increased in uc <dig> and uc <dig> compared to g217b. pkc <dig> has not previously been directly connected to the pheromone response pathway in any fungal organism. pkc <dig> is connected to the pheromone response pathway through crosstalk in s. cerevisiae, where the cell wall integrity pathway and the pheromone response pathway are both activated by pheromone  <cit> . pkc <dig> is required for the crosstalk between the pheromone response pathway and the cell integrity pathway in s. cerevisiae, which is, in turn, required for mating  <cit> . our studies showed that silencing hmk <dig>  the predicted map kinase involved in the pheromone response pathway, had no effect on cleistothecia production in uc <dig>  it is possible that the pheromone response map kinase pathway plays a minimal role in cleistothecia production of h. capsulatum. the pheromone response pathway may be playing a greater role in other aspects of the mating process, such as ascospore formation. since the uc <dig> strain forms empty cleistothecia and the reasons for the lack of ascospore formation are unknown, it would be difficult to define the role of the pheromone response pathway in any aspect of mating besides cleistothecia production using this strain. future studies will, however, be able to address the role of the cell wall integrity pathway in cleistothecia production using the uc <dig> strain.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we generated a laboratory strain of h. capsulatum, uc <dig>  by insertional mutagenesis of a mating incompetent strain that was subsequently able to form empty cleistothecia with a recent clinical isolate. we determined that rna levels of genes involved in the mating process are increased in uc <dig>  and that the t-dna insertion site plays a role in the strain's ability to form empty cleistothecia. using uc <dig> as a tool to study cleistothecia production, we determined that pkc <dig> rna levels are increased in uc <dig> and uc <dig>  we established a link between pkc <dig> activity and pheromone production by showing that a pkc inhibitor decreases rna levels of ppg <dig> in uc <dig> and uc <dig>  pkc <dig> is tenuously linked with mating ability in other fungi, and further studies in h. capsulatum are required to provide evidence of a direct link between mating ability and pkc <dig> activity. future studies in cleistothecia production of h. capsulatum may provide a means to prevent or reverse the loss of mating ability as this organism is cultured in the laboratory.
