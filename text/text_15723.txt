BACKGROUND
esophageal cancer is the eighth most common and the sixth most frequent fatal human cancer in the world  <cit>  and the fourth most common incident cancer in china  <cit> . shanxi province, a region in north central china, has among the highest esophageal cancer rates in china and nearly all of these cases are esophageal squamous cell carcinoma . escc is an aggressive tumor which is typically diagnosed only after the onset of symptoms when prognosis is very poor. the  <dig> % 5-year survival rate is fourth worst among all cancers in the usa  <cit> . one promising strategy to reduce escc mortality is early detection. further, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying esophageal carcinogenesis and its molecular pathology will facilitate the development of biomarkers for early detection.

genomic instability is one of several mechanisms that can lead to gene dysregulation and has been thought to play an important role in the etiology of human cancers, including both histologic types of esophageal cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma and escc  <cit> . in previous studies using a variety of different methods we found that loh was common in esccs from shanxi province in north central china. these studies identified over  <dig> common loh regions, frequent copy number alterations , as well as numerous copy number neutral regions, which suggests that this cancer is characterized by genomic instability  <cit> . in addition, somatic mutations in several genes with critical roles in carcinogenesis  have been identified in escc patients with loh in regions that include the genes , indicating that a wide variety of dna alterations in numerous genes occur in the development of this tumor.

gene expression microarray technology is an important tool for evaluating tumor heterogeneity and has been successfully applied to identify subsets of tumors  with different clinical parameters such as survival, histological grade, invasive status, and response to therapy . in recent years, mirnas have emerged as a major class of regulatory genes, and one class of mirnas, conserved mirna, has targets which can now be predicted with confidence. it is thought that the role of mirnas is to control expression of target genes. thus, dysregulation of mirna is expected in human diseases such as cancer, which are attributed to dysregulation of gene expression in tumor suppressors and oncogenes . further, dysregulation of some mirnas has been related to patient survival in some cancers, including escc  <cit> . biallelic loss is thought to play a critical role in tumor pathogenesis, especially because of its influence on expression of affected genes  and related mirna, however, these relations have not been well studied in escc. since cancer is a complex disease, it is increasingly important that analyses combine the evaluation of alterations in dna and rna, including those that occur in both mrna and mirna, in order to better understand their potential interactions in the development of cancers.

it has become clear that human genetic variation ranges from single nucleotide changes at the sequence level up to multi-megabase chromosomal aberrations. of the molecular genetic changes that occur during the development of human cancer, alterations in snps are likely among the earliest or even the initial events that lead to genomic instability. while studying large changes  in tumor cells is informative, knowledge of the more numerous small alterations that occur at the nucleotide sequence level are equally or more critical to our understanding of the detailed process of carcinogenesis, particularly at its earliest stages. for example, biallelic loss in genes may cause double strand breaks which result in widespread structural rearrangements of the genome. however, how alterations of dna  influence gene expression remains largely unknown, especial for snps that are not in coding regions.

in the present study, we performed global profiling of alterations in dna as well as expression of mrna and mirna in tumors and their matched normal tissues from  <dig> escc cases. using these profiles, we identified genes with biallelic loss and examined their mrna expression and mirna targets as an initial step in understanding relations among these small alterations in nucleic acids in escc.

methods
case selection
this study was approved by the institutional review boards of the shanxi cancer hospital and the us national cancer institute . briefly, cases diagnosed with escc between  <dig> and  <dig> in the shanxi cancer hospital in taiyuan, shanxi province, pr china, and considered candidates for curative surgical resection were identified and recruited to participate in this study after obtaining written informed consent. none of the cases had prior therapy and shanxi was the ancestral home for all. cases ranged in age from  <dig> to  <dig> years  and were predominantly female . clinically, most cases had stage  <dig>  cancers and half had evidence of metastasis at diagnosis. the escc cases studied here were previously evaluated for loh and copy number alterations using genome-wide arrays  <cit> .

biological specimen collection and processing
venous blood  was taken from each case prior to surgery and germline dna from whole blood was extracted and purified using the standard phenol/chloroform method. tumor and adjacent normal tissues were dissected at the time of surgery and stored in liquid nitrogen until used. dna was extracted from micro-dissected tumor as previously described  <cit>  using the protocol from the puregene dna purification tissue kit .

rna was extracted from  <dig> of the micro-dissected tumors and their matched normal tissue pairs as described previously using the protocol from the purelink micro-to-midi total rna purification system   <cit> ; total rna from  <dig> cases was isolated by using the allprep kit  per the manufacturer’s instructions. rna quality and quantity were determined using the rna  <dig> labchip/agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer .

target preparation for genechip human mapping 500k array set
the affymetrix genechip human mapping 500k array set was previously performed in these patients . the set array contains ~ <dig>   and ~ <dig>   snps . a detailed gene chip protocol can be found at http://www.affymetrix.com/support/downloads/manuals/500k_assay_manual.pdf.

experiments were conducted according to the protocol  supplied by affymetrix, inc. . genotype calls were generated by gtype v  <dig>  software . paired germ-line and tumor dna from each case were run together in parallel in the same experiment . the geo accession number for these snp array data is gse <dig> 

probe preparation and hybridization for human genome u133a  <dig>  array
the affymetrix human genome u133a  <dig>  array is a single array used to interrogate expression of  <dig>  well-characterized human genes. array experiments were performed using 1-5ug total rna for each array as described previously  <cit> . we followed the protocol provided by the manufacturer to carry out reverse transcription, labeling, and hybridization. . rna from paired tumor and normal esophageal tissues were run together in parallel in the same experiment. the geo accession number for these expression array data is gse <dig> 

abi mirna expression array by rt-pcr
the taqman® low density array was used to determine microrna expression in this study, which employed the 9700ht fast real-time pcr system from abi. comprehensive coverage of sanger mirbase v <dig> was enabled via a two-card set of taqman® array microrna cards  for a total of  <dig> assays specific to  <dig> unique human mirnas. in addition, each card contains one selected endogenous control assay , five human endogenous controls  that are the most highly abundant and stably expressed across all tissues, and one negative control assay . card a focused on more highly characterized mirnas, while card b contained more recently discovered mirnas along with the mir* sequences.

rna from paired tumor and normal esophageal tissues were run together in parallel in the same experiment. the protocol followed the manufacturer’s manual at http://www <dig> appliedbiosystems.com/cms/groups/mcb_support/documents/generaldocuments/cms_ <dig> pdf. briefly, three ul of total rna  was added to  <dig> ul of rt reaction mix, which consisted of 10x megaplex rt primers, 100mm dntps with dttp, 50u/ul multiscribe reverse transcriptase, 10x rt buffer, 25mm mgcl <dig>  20u/ul rnase inhibitor, and nuclease-free h2o. the samples were run on a thermal cycler using the following conditions:  <dig> cycles of  <dig> °c for two min,  <dig> °c for one min, and  <dig> °c for one sec. all reactions were completed with a final incubation of  <dig> °c for five min. six ul of cdna generated from the thermal cycler was mixed with 450ul of 2x taqman universal pcr master mix with no amperase ung, and 444ul of nuclease-free h2o. 100ul of the reaction mix was added to each of eight fill ports on the taqman microrna array. the filled array was centrifuged twice at  <dig> rpm for one min, and then sealed with the eight fill ports removed. the array was run on the 7900ht rt-pcr system with sds software. the comparative ct method was used to determine the expression levels of mature mirnas. the geo accession number for these mirna data is gse <dig> 

genechip 500k array data analysis
probe intensity data from affymetrix 500k snp arrays were used to identify dna alterations in the present study. to avoid gender-related issues, snps mapped to either the x or y chromosome were excluded. affymetrix snp array data were first normalized using the gtype-probe set-genotype package included in affymetrix power tools version  <dig> . each tumor sample was individually normalized via the brlmm algorithm along with  <dig> blood samples. these blood samples were obtained from the  <dig> escc cases evaluated in the present study plus  <dig> healthy controls  who were all part of a larger case–control study of upper gastrointestinal  cancers conducted in shanxi province  <cit> . biallelic loss, including loss of both alleles in heterozygotes as well as homozygous deletions, was determined based on comparison of matched tumor versus germline dna. several criteria were used to determine biallelic loss as follows: 1) a snp with biallelic loss must have  a “no call” genotype call in the tumor sample;  a high quality genotype call in the normal sample; and  reduced copy number ; 2) analysis was limited to snps in genes ; and 3) analysis was limited to snps that fulfilled elements from criterion # <dig>  to  in at least  <dig> % of the  <dig> escc cases studied. analyses of loh and cn were described previously  <cit> .

human genome u133a  <dig>  array data analysis and relation between biallelic loss and mrna expression
for all of the affymetrix u <dig> array data, raw data sets  after scanning were normalized using rma as implemented in bioconductor in r , including background correction and normalization across all samples. for each sample, log <dig> fold changes in gene expression were calculated by subtracting the adjacent normal rma value from the corresponding tumor rma value.

to assess the influence of biallelic loss on expression, we performed the following steps:  first, genes assayed by the u133a microarray were mapped onto each biallelic loss segment of each sample. map locations of genes were taken from the affymetrix version na <dig> microarray annotation file.  we then performed two-sided unpaired wilcoxon rank sum tests comparing the log <dig> fold changes for a probe set in biallelic loss positive and negative samples. a p-value < <dig>  was considered significant.  finally, snps on the 500k microarray were mapped to the reference sequence for each expression probe set. average fold changes were used to relate mrna expression to dna biallelic loss.

abi mirna expression array analysis
rq manager integrated in software from abi was used to normalize the entire signal generated. expression level  was calculated when both tumor and normal samples had signals in the assays using dataassist software v <dig>  . signals for mirna that showed either in tumor only or normal only were dropped from analysis. fold change was calculated using the  <dig> -ΔΔct method. in the present study, the data are presented as fold change in the target gene expression in tumors normalized to the internal control gene  and relative to the normal tissue control . results of the real-time pcr data are represented as ct values, with ct defined as the threshold cycle number of pcrs at which amplified product was first detected. the average ct was calculated for both the target gene and mammu <dig> and the Δct was determined as  minus . the ΔΔct represented the difference between the paired tissue samples, as calculated by the formula ΔΔct 
= . the n-fold differential expression in the target gene of a tumor sample compared to its normal sample counterpart was expressed as  <dig> -ΔΔct. for each case, the frequency of dysregulated mirnas was calculated as the number of dysregulated mirnas divided by the total number of mirnas that showed signals in both tumor and normal. the criteria used to call an mirna dysregulated were fold changes ≥  <dig> or ≤  <dig> .

we used targetscan   and sanger mirbase  to identify conserved mirnas in the 3′ utr for affected genes, which are thought to be preferentially conserved.

we used median fold change for both mirna and mrna in our analysis of the relation between expressions of mirna and genes. correlations and p-values between selected variables were performed using spearman rank correlations and wilcoxon rank tests.

the overall average genotype call rate was  <dig> % in the present study for the  <dig> chips evaluated: average call rates for the 250k nsp chip were  <dig> % for both germline dna  and tumor dna , and average call rates for the 250k sty chip were  <dig> %  for germline dna and  <dig> %  for tumor dna.

we identified  <dig> snps that showed frequent biallelic loss, that is, in at least  <dig> %  of escc tumors . those  <dig> snps mapped to  <dig> genes and represent  <dig>  % of the total of  <dig> snps in those genes on our snp array. nearly all of the  <dig> genes represented by these snps were concentrated on just four chromosomal arms . table  <dig> summarizes biallelic loss frequencies for each of the  <dig> genes, including the number of cases with biallelic loss, the number of snps with biallelic loss in at least three cases, the number of snps mapped within the gene and present on the snp array, and the fraction of the snps with biallelic loss among all the snps in the gene. some of the genes shown in table  <dig> are known cancer-associated genes . genes affected by biallelic loss were relatively rare , and far less common than loh or copy number alterations in escc. however, such alterations could be more severe and consequently might have greater impact on tumorigenesis.table  <dig> description of genes with frequent biallelic loss in escc1

2no. snps with biallelic loss in  <dig> or more cases



we also examined our escc cases by the frequency of biallelic loss frequency among the  <dig> snps in the  <dig> genes with biallelic loss . fourteen cases had at least  <dig> snps with biallelic loss and were termed “higher biallelic loss cases”, whereas the remaining  <dig> cases had fewer than  <dig> snps with biallelic loss and were called “lower biallelic loss cases.” table  <dig> summarizes dna changes  among the  <dig> snps in the  <dig> genes with biallelic loss for each of the  <dig> escc cases. the number of snps affected by loh and copy number alterations varied widely among cases. the number of snps with biallelic loss was highly correlated with both the number of snps with loh  and the number of snps with copy number loss , but was not significantly correlated with either the number of snps with copy number gain  or the number of snps with copy number neutral loh .table  <dig> description of dna alterations in snps found in genes with frequent biallelic loss among escc cases1



1cases listed in order by no. snps with biallelic loss; cases with 100+ snps with biallelic loss = ‘higher loss cases’, <100 = ‘lower loss cases’



we also checked for microdeletions or biallelic loss regions on chromosomes  caused by continuous snps with biallelic loss, but were unable to identify any.

biallelic loss and expression of mrna and mirna
among the  <dig> genes with biallelic loss,  <dig> had probes represented on the affymetrix hu  <dig> array with signals in both tumor and normal tissues. we found that  <dig> of these  <dig> genes  had lower mrna expression levels in cases with biallelic loss than cases with no biallelic loss , including eight genes in which mrna expression was statistically significantly lower . for example, the mean fold change in mtap expression was  <dig>  in cases with biallelic loss versus  <dig>  in cases with no biallelic loss . eleven genes had expression levels that were the same or higher in cases with biallelic loss than cases with no loss . as an example, the median fold change for expression of adamts <dig> was  <dig>  in cases with biallelic loss compared to  <dig>  in cases without biallelic loss . although expression differences observed were modest, these results suggest that biallelic loss appeared to influence gene expression.fig.  <dig> mrna expression by biallelic loss status for  <dig> genes in escc. x-axis: names of  <dig> genes present on the affymetrix hu  <dig> a chip with a signal present in both tumor and matched normal tissues; y-axis: gene expression fold changes  in cases with biallelic loss  and in cases without biallelic loss 



expression of mirnas by biallelic loss status is shown in additional file 3: table s <dig>  the ratio of mirna expression in target genes with biallelic loss  was greater than one for  <dig> of  <dig>  mirnas and less than one in  <dig> of  <dig> .

mirna expression and target gene expression in genes with frequent biallelic loss
there were a total of  <dig> mirnas on the abi chips a & b in our analysis. two hundred sixty-eight mirnas were excluded from further analysis because of inadequate data , leaving  <dig> mirnas that showed signals in both the tumor and the normal tissues in at least  <dig> % of the  <dig> escc cases  for our analyses . we checked the conserved mirna targets in the 3′ utrs for the  <dig> genes with mrna results using http://www.targetscan.org/ and found  <dig> genes that could be targeted by one or more of the mirnas present on the abi mirna array. after further filtering , we had data available to analyze the relation between the expression of  <dig> mirnas  and  <dig> gene targets in our  <dig> escc cases . we found a relatively wide range of mirna expression levels among these gene targets . overall, in the  <dig> genes with biallelic loss that were evaluable, mirna expression levels were more often elevated  than mrna expression levels . when mirna and mrna were examined together, expression levels of  <dig>  mirnas were elevated  while their target gene expression levels were reduced . examples of interesting mirna-target gene pairs that showed this pattern were: expression of mir- <dig> was  <dig> -fold and its target gene adamts <dig> expression was  <dig> -fold; mir- <dig> was  <dig> -fold and its target gene suclg <dig> was  <dig> -fold; and expression of mir- <dig> was  <dig> -fold while its target foxp <dig> was  <dig> -fold. conversely,  <dig> mirnas showed reduced expression in both the mirna and its target gene. an illustrative example of this relation is the  <dig> -fold expression change for mir-133b <dig> -fold in its target gene iqgap expression. taken together, our results indicate that mirna expression levels varied widely. increased mirna most often was associated with reduced target gene expression, but reduced target gene expression was also frequently seen with reduced mirna in escc.

discussion
in the present study, we took an integrative approach by evaluating genes in relation to biallelic loss and expression of both mrna and mirna in escc cases using profiling data generated from arrays. we made several observations from our evaluation of these data. first, biallelic loss was relatively uncommon, but when it occurred it was concentrated in four chromosome arms, namely, 3p, 9p, 5q, and 4p. second, biallelic loss appeared to affect gene expression; nearly  <dig> % of genes in cases with biallelic loss showed reduced mrna expression compared to those without loss. third, although the relation was less clear than for mrna, biallelic loss also appeared to affect mirna expression. more informative future studies will need larger sample sizes so as to have more heterozygous snps for evaluation, and appropriate coverage of promoter regions, to confirm and expand our findings here regarding relations between snps with biallelic loss and expression of mrna and mirna.

distributions of mirna expressions were generally higher in cases with biallelic loss than in cases without loss. of  <dig> mirna-target gene pairs,  <dig> pairs  had higher mirna expression with biallelic loss than without, while  <dig> pairs  had lower mirna expression. finally, the effect of biallelic loss on the relation between mirna and mrna expression was complex. biallelic loss was most commonly associated with a pattern of elevated mirna and reduced mrna , but a pattern of both reduced mirna and mrna was also common .

in our study,  <dig> genes showed biallelic loss and half of these genes were located on chromosome 3p, our most common site of loss. the frequency of biallelic loss among the  <dig> genes on chromosome 3p ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> % . this region includes several tumor suppressor genes . our previous studies also showed high frequency of loh on chromosome 3p in escc  <cit> . taken together, biallelic loss, similar to loh, appears to play a role in the stability of chromosome 3p in escc. although most snps that show biallelic loss and/or loh are located in the non-coding regions of these genes, they may exert their effects via gene expression. for example, biallelic loss of chl <dig>  affected six of  <dig> snps, and the expression level of chl <dig> was reduced in cases with biallelic loss but elevated in cases without biallelic loss , while mirna-10a and mirna-10b expression levels, which both target chl <dig>  were higher in cases with biallelic loss than those without . interestingly, a previous study showed that mir-10b may play a causal role in inducing metastatic behavior  <cit> . we note that expression levels for some genes did not show big differences by biallelic loss status, or even higher expression levels in cases with biallelic loss than those without. one potential explanation for this finding is epigenetic alterations such as dna methylation changes.

our results indicate that escc tumors may be divided into two groups: those with high and those with low levels of genome instability as assessed by the number of snps with biallelic loss , suggesting that the genetic stability is variable, even among patients from a seemingly homogeneous population with extraordinarily high rates of esophageal cancer. our results also show that both mirna and mrna levels varied widely despite the fact that the esophageal cancer patients studied here were similar in many important ways   <cit> , suggesting that escc is incredibly complex and that there is significant heterogeneity among escc patients. this is likely one reason why tumors that appear similar can progress and respond to therapy in dramatically different ways. new insights gained from better understanding of case/tumor heterogeneity should be useful for predicting response to therapy  <cit> .

although several studies have evaluated biallelic loss/homozygous deletion within specific genes in tumors , including escc  <cit> , using techniques such as fish, only a few prior reports have used genome-wide techniques such as snp or comparative genomic hybridization  arrays to agnostically assess homozygous deletions in tumor cell lines or tissues. cancers evaluated for biallelic loss with array technology include prostate   <cit> , b-cell lymphomas   <cit> , and b-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia   <cit> . among the largest of these studies, guichard et al. used cgh arrays and recently reported that  <dig> % of  <dig> hepatocellular carcinomas had homozygous deletions  <cit> . twelve regions were recurrently altered, including most frequently loci at cdkn2a-cdkn2b , axin <dig> , and irf <dig> . to the best of our best knowledge, our study is the first report of biallelic loss identified in genes in escc cases using array technology.

we note that there are several limitations in the current study, most notably our small sample size. in addition, most of the snps identified with biallelic loss were in introns of genes, and our small sample size precluded detailed assessment of interactions among dna, rna, and mirna. a major strength of this study is that all  <dig> escc cases reported were evaluated using the same array platforms and every case had both tumor and normal tissue dna, rna, and mirna profiled using genome-wide methods, so that our comparisons are comprehensive and carefully controlled paired comparisons within the same case.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our results indicate that biallelic loss in escc is uncommon, but when it occurs it is localized to a few specific chromosomal regions and appears to influence mrna expression of affected genes, leading to complex patterns of expression of mirna and target genes in escc patients.
