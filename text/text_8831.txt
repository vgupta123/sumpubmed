BACKGROUND
spermatogenesis, a complex yet highly regulated developmental process of male germ cells, consists of three stages--the proliferation of spermatogonia, the meiosis of spermatocytes and the morphogenesis of spermatids  <cit> . the formation of the terminally-differentiated germ cells, the spermatozoa, requires a series of important processes that are unique to spermatogenic cells, including nuclear condensation, mitochondrial rearrangement, histone replacement by transition proteins and protamin, the shedding of residual bodies, and the formation of acrosomes  <cit> . it is not surprising that a large number of testis-specific genes are required for these events. in mice and rats, several high throughput gene expression datasets have revealed that a large number of genes are expressed to fuel spermatogenesis  <cit> . it is also estimated that about 4% of protein-coding genes in the mouse genome are specifically expressed in the mouse testis  <cit> .

ubiquitination of protein is an indispensable post-translational modification that serves as a component of the protein quality control system. it is also involved in diverse biological processes such as signal transduction, dna repair, transcriptional regulation in a protein degradation-independent way  <cit> . in principle, ubiquitination is a process containing three ubiquitin transferring reactions catalyzed by three corresponding enzymes. at first, the  <dig> -kda ubiquitin polypeptide is activated by the ubiquitin-activating enzyme  in an atp-dependent way. subsequently, this activated ubiquitin is transferred to the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme  via a thioester bond. in the end, the ubiquitin is transferred to a lysine residue of the substrate catalyzed by the ubiquitin-protein ligase   <cit> . substrate specificity is conferred by e3s, implying a much larger number of e3s in the genome than e1s and e2s. the mammalian genome encodes 1 ~  <dig> e1s, 10 ~  <dig> e2s and several hundred e3s  <cit> . there are three typical e <dig> families including the ring finger family, hect domain family and the u-box family  <cit> .

to our knowledge, approximate  <dig> e3s have been reported to be expressed in mammalian testes and most of them execute diverse functions at different stages of spermatogenesis . a dozen of e3s as well as associated complex play important roles in dna double strands break  and histone modifications during early meiosis. as examples, the expression of lasu <dig> complex and cul4a-crl <dig> is detected primarily in spermatogonia stage and involved in histone ubiquitination during meiosis  <cit> . an n-end rule pathway e <dig> ligase, ubr <dig>  plays a critical role in transcriptional chromosome inactivation via ubiquitination of histone h2a  <cit> . the majority of e3s that are highly expressed in haploid germ cells probably contribute to the morphogenesis during the formation of spermatozoa. for instance, march <dig> is a microtubule associated e <dig> and is involved in the organization and maintenance of the flagella of spermatozoa  <cit> .

although it has been known that the mammalian genome encodes a large number of e3s, the exact number is still not known particularly when higher specificity of mining is a major concern to the experimental scientists. moreover, how these putative e3s are expressed during mammalian spermatogenesis is still an open question. in the present study, we mined out putative e3s from the mouse and human genome, evaluated their expression in multiple tissues, particularly in the mouse testis at different stages. the ligase activity of selected e3s was confirmed by in vitro and in vivo assays. our list of e3s expressed during spermatogenesis provides a valuable source for future functional studies of the ubiquitination during mammalian spermatogenesis.

RESULTS
mining of e3s from the mouse and human genomes
to mine putative e3s from the mouse and human genomes, we first compiled all protein-coding genes from several microarray datasets  generated from gene expression profiling of multiple tissues and the est dataset from the unigene database  <cit> . as a result,  <dig> and  <dig> mouse and human genes were identified, respectively, and  <dig> genes were homologous genes  based on the homologene database annotation . we then searched all protein coding genes for domains/motifs in the pfam_ls and pfam_fs library  using hmmer  <dig> . <dig> software package  with most of the parameters being set to the default values. the e value of the hit was set to be no more than  <dig> . proteins containing the ring domain , the hect domain and the u-box domain were considered as typical e3s. as a result,  <dig> and  <dig> putative e3s were identified from the mouse and the human genome, respectively . among them,  <dig> putative e3s were homologues  between the two species . the proportion of homologues in the e <dig> set is significantly higher than expected from the number of general homologues of the mouse and the human genomes . we also identified the yeast homologues of the initial  <dig> mouse/human homologous pairs from  <dig> yeast e3s , and only  <dig> highly conserved e3s among these three species were found . these observations suggested that e <dig> genes are more conserved between the mouse and human genome. 

expression of e <dig> mrnas in the mouse testis
we next examined the mrna expression levels of e <dig> genes in the mouse based on four microarray datasets  and the unigene dataset. for each dataset, we defined  <dig> expression levels of an mrna in a particular tissue in the increasing order of tissue specificity—a , p , hp , ms , and sp . the level a/p is just based on a gene’s p/a call value determined by the affymatrix platform using the mas <dig> algorithm  <cit> . the other three levels were based on the comparison of the mrna’s z-score with three threshold values . the evaluations from different datasets were summarized by voting—a level value is assigned only when it is supported by no less than two datasets. a putative e <dig> is always assigned to the highest specificity group exclusively. as a result, we identified  <dig> p level e3s,  <dig> hp level e3s,  <dig> ms level e3s, and  <dig> sp level e3s in the mouse testis . compared with other tissues such as the liver, the lung, the muscle, the testis contains significantly more specific e3s . therefore, a large number of e3s are expressed in the mouse testis and a significant portion is specifically expressed. 

stage-specific expression of e <dig> mrnas during mouse spermatogenesis
we further studied the stage-specific expression of putative e3s during mouse spermatogenesis using three microarray datasets  derived from gene expression profiling of testis at different days postpartum or of different spermatogenic cell types  <cit> . genes that are 3-folds or more differentially expressed at one or more time point  were selected for further clustering analysis. based on visual inspection of the heat maps of the clustering analysis, three clusters of genes were identified according to the stages when their expressions start to increase. genes in group mi are expressed at a higher level at the mitotic division stage, genes in group me start to increase their expression level at meiotic division stage while genes in group pm start to increase their expression at the post meiosis stage. results from the three datasets were again summarized by voting—a gene was assigned to a particular group only if it was supported by  <dig> or  <dig> votes. as results,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> e3s were assigned to the mi, me, and pm groups, respectively, totaling up to  <dig> . by taking intersections of each of three groups with each of the sp, ms, hp, and p classes, it can be seen that the putative testis specific e3s increase their expression during or after meiosis. 

stage-specific expression of e <dig> proteins during mouse spermatogenesis
in a separate study, we examined protein levels in type a spermatogonia, pachytene spermatocytes, round spermatids, and elongated spermatids using the itraq mass spectrometry . thousands of proteins were identified in each cell type. we selected e3s from these detected proteins and examined their dynamic changes during spermatogenesis.  <dig> annotated e3s were found . the heat maps of the clustering analysis showed that these proteins could be separated into two groups according to the dynamic change of their expression. protein expression of group  <dig> is up regulated after meiosis while group  <dig> is on the contrary. meanwhile, we performed an rna deep sequencing in the same cell type . compared to itraq analysis, the expression patterns of most rnas were consistent with those of protein expression. the changes of a portion of proteins were lagging behind those of their rnas probably due to translation inhibition .

validation of mrna expression of selected putative e3s by rt-pcr
among the  <dig> putative testis-specific e3s,  <dig> have not been well studied. we selected  <dig> of them randomly and checked their mrna expression in  <dig> different tissues  using rt-pcr. as shown by figure 4a, majority were exclusively detected in the testis while the remaining one were expressed in the testis at much higher levels than in other tissues. these result indicated that our testis specificity evaluation of genes based on microarray data is highly reliable. examination of their expression at different days postpartum indicated that almost all of them were expressed at stages when haploid cells are generated . we further examined expression of some genes in isolated type a spermatogonia , pachytene spermatocyte , round spermatid  and elonged spermatid . the purity of the isolated germ cells all exceeded 90% as determined by morphological evaluation, and was also confirmed by measuring the expression of known marker genes that are either uniquely or highly expressed in each type cells . as shown by figure 4c, most of the e3s start their expression in either pacscs or rsts.

subcellular localization of putative e3s with or without transmembrane domains
a significant number of e3s have signal peptides and/or transmembrane domains  suggesting that they may anchor to the cell’s membrane system to execute their functions.  <dig> and  <dig> annotated e3s were identified with either signal peptide and/or tmd, respectively . as subcellular localizations of e3s help to understand their function, and no antibodies were available for in vivo studies, we decided to transfect cho cells with plasmid constructs of e3s fused to egfp to study their subcellular localization. we selected  <dig> e3s with tmd  and  <dig> without , and used mouse ubc <dig>  an endoplasmic reticulum-localized integral membrane e <dig>  as the reference  <cit> . cho cells were co-transfected with the egfp-e <dig> and the mmubc6-dsred constructs. subcellular localization of the fusion proteins were inspected under fluorescent microscope. as shown in figure 5b, rnf <dig> was only localized in the nucleus in a punctate manner. rnf <dig> and nsmce <dig> was localized both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm in a diffused manner, while rnf <dig> and znrf <dig> were only localized in the cytoplasm, co-localized well with mmubc6-dsred. the localizations of rnf <dig> and znrf <dig> were consistent with previous report  <cit> , indicating that our assays using the fluorescent fusion proteins were reliable for subcellular localization studies. 

in vitro and in vivo ubiquitin ligase activities of putative e3s
it was important to test whether the putative e3s indeed possess ubiquitin ligase activities in order to understand their function. however, due to the lack of antibodies to immunoprecipitate native e3s from testis or germ cell lysate, we decided to used recombinant protein and tagged protein immunoprecipitated from transfected cells to examine their enzymatic activity. three putative e <dig> genes  were cloned into the pgex-4t <dig> vector. gst fusion proteins were expressed and purified from e coli. in vitro ubiquitination assays were performed by including e <dig>  e <dig>  e <dig>  and ubiquitin. anti-ubiquitin  antibody was used to detect polyubiquitin chains. to screen the e <dig> with highest ubiquitin catalytic activity, three human and one mouse recombinant e2s  were tested. our results showed that ube2l <dig> has barely-detectable activity while ube2d <dig> has the highest activity . the polyubiquitin chain was formed when all reactants were added , while, it was not detected if any of the reactants were excluded. therefore, the ligase activity of the putative e3s was detected in a substrate-independent way.

the ligase activity of these e3s was also confirmed in hek 293ft cells transfected with plasmid constructs that gave rise to flag-tagged e3s and ha-tagged ub. cell lysate was subjected to immunoprecipitation  using the flag antibody conjugated beads and immunoblotted using the anti-ha antibody. as shown in figure 7a, poly  chains were detected for all tested e3s. it has been known that some e3s are first polyubiquitinated before they transfer the poly  chain to their substrates. to tell whether the poly  chain detected was from the e3s or any protein that was co-immunoprecipitated with the e3s, the cell lysate was first boiled with high concentration sds to disrupt any potential protein-protein interaction before immunoprecipitated with the beads. as shown in figure 7b, polyubiquitination was still detected with rnf <dig> and rnf <dig>  these results showed that some e3s promoted self-ubiquitination before their substrates were ubiquitinated. a potential role of self-ubiquitination of e3s is to regulate the ligase activity and recruit substrates during spermatogenesis  <cit> . our results also indicated that it was very likely that most, if not all, e3s identified by bioinformatics analysis were active enzymes. considering their different sub-cellular localizations as indicated by the transfection assays, it seemed that these e3s were involved in diverse molecular processes during spermatogenesis such as protein quality control, organelle turnover, chromatin remodeling, to name a few. 

discussion
in the present study, we conducted genome-wide search and annotation of putative e3s from several high-throughput expression datasets. we mined out putative e3s from protein coding genes whose expression have been examined in different tissues, and investigated their mrna and protein expressions in the mouse testis. according to microarray data, we discovered that a large number of putative e3s were expressed in the mouse testis and that some of them were specifically expressed there, which were confirmed by rt-pcrs. the protein expression patterns of  <dig> e3s were detected in different spermatogenic cells using the itraq ms technology . the e <dig> ligase activity of some selected proteins was confirmed by ubiquitin assays. these results indicated that our mining and annotation strategy was reliable and distinguished its self from some previous mining procedures purely based on sequence analysis.

according to a report by li et al. based on bioinformatics analysis, the human genome contains  <dig> putative e3s  <cit> . this number was derived from motif searching using the hidden markov models  for domains such as hect, ring/u-box, f-box, socs-box etc. it is known that most, if not all, hect and ring/u-box proteins are true e3s while those f-box-, socs-box containing ones are not necessarily a component of the e <dig> complexes  <cit> . therefore, we limited our searches by using only the hect and ring/u-box domains to reduce the false positive rate. indeed, li et al. used several datasets containing predicted transcripts and corresponding proteins of the human genome in order for the search to be comprehensive. however, we think for bench-working scientists, higher specificity is more important than higher sensitivity. accordingly, we only used protein-coding genes derived from the affymetrix expression genechips  and the unigene database as the target sets to be mined. as a result, we identified  <dig> putative e3s, of which  <dig> were the ring family members from the mouse genome. our  <dig> human e3s are not all covered by li’s  <dig> e3s. the intersection between our  <dig> human e3s and the  <dig> by li et al. is  <dig>  we found that the list of li et al. only contained  <dig> human e3s based on the hect and ring/u-box domains. therefore, our mining should be more specific than li et al. and also more sensitive if the same set of domains were used. moreover, we found that li et al. mined  <dig> more e3s based on only ring and u-box domains than we did. however, a manual curation of these  <dig> genes by us indicated that  <dig> actually did not contain the ring or u-box,  <dig> were pseudogenes,  <dig> was discontinued gene,  <dig> were e4s, and only  <dig> typical e <dig> was left.

the main goal of the present study was to profile the expression of e3s in the mouse testis during spermatogenesis. taking advantage of several multiple tissue microarray datasets, we rated the expression levels of putative e3s as  <dig> levels . the rating system was based on a supposed normal distribution of gene expression in different tissues and the final rate was determined by votes from different datasets. therefore, the rating was highly stringent as was confirmed by the rt-pcr results. almost all predicted testis-specific e3s were indeed specifically expressed in the testis. in addition, we found that majority of the putative e3s were expressed in the mouse testis, and the number of testis-specific e3s was much higher than in other tissues such as the liver, the lung, and the muscle. the stages-specific expression of e3s during mouse spermatogenesis indicated that most of the testis-specific e3s were expressed in spermatocytes and spermatids. as spermatocytes undergo meiosis and spermatids go through a number of unique processes such as acrosome formation, histone replacement, flagellum formation and shedding of most of the cytoplasm, it is reasonable that these cells need many tissue-specific e3s to catalyze the turnover of proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
we performed a mining of ubiquitin ligases in the mouse genome and analyzed their expression profile in the mouse testis systematically. the identification of a large number of homologous putative e3s between human and mouse suggests that these enzymes are highly conserved in the two species. our analysis reveals that  <dig> putative e3s are expressed in the mouse testis and  <dig> e3s are highly or specifically expressed. based on in vitro and in vivo essays, the ligase activity of several novel e3s expressed during the mouse spermatogenesis are confirmed. the lists of e3s expressed at different levels during spermatogenesis provide a valuable resource from which key factors regulating spermatogenesis could be identified.
