BACKGROUND
the vaginal microbiota of healthy women consists of a wide variety of anaerobic and aerobic bacterial genera and species dominated by the facultative, microaerophilic anaerobic genus lactobacillus <cit> . the activity of lactobacilli helps to maintain the natural healthy balance of the vaginal microbiota. this role is particularly important during pregnancy because abnormalities in vaginal communities, such as bacterial vaginosis  and aerobic vaginitis , have been claimed as important mechanisms responsible for preterm birth and perinatal complications  <cit> .

the association of lower genital tract infection with an increased risk of preterm delivery and preterm rupture of the fetal membranes has recently attracted great interest in the pathogenesis of such infection-related mechanisms  <cit> . earlier studies showed an increased rate of prematurity in women with bv, an alteration of the endogenous vaginal microbiota associated with decreased levels of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacillus species  <cit> . the mechanisms linking bv with preterm delivery have not been fully identified, but local immune response is hypothesized to be crucial. despite the notion that bv is a non-inflammatory condition, evidence exists that demonstrates altered levels of certain pro-inflammatory cytokines in women with bv  <cit> .

parturition is characterized by cervical ripening and myometrial maturation with subsequent uterine contractions leading to cervical dilatation and birth  <cit> . the process of labor displays many of the hallmarks of inflammation. acute inflammatory features, such as increased influx of leucocytes and elevated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, have been observed in cervical tissues and fetal membranes during both term and preterm labor  <cit> .

a potentially novel way to protect against infection-mediated preterm birth is to use probiotic bacteria, especially lactobacilli. probiotics, defined as “live microorganisms which, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host”  <cit> , are being studied for their ability to replenish vaginal lactobacilli and modulate immunity  <cit> . in addition, administration of probiotics to the mother during pregnancy and breast-feeding has been described by some studies as a safe and effective mode of enhancing the immunoprotective potential of the breast milk and preventing atopic eczema in the infant  <cit> .

in recent years, culture-independent techniques based on the analysis of rrna gene sequences have been developed, providing powerful tools to reveal the phylogenetic diversity of the microorganisms found within vaginal microbiota and to understand community dynamics  <cit> . in particular, pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis  has been successfully used to identify the bacterial composition of different ecological niches, including the vaginal microbiota  <cit> . real-time pcr is a powerful technique for the quantitative analysis of specific microbial populations belonging to complex ecosystems  <cit> . specific primers can be used to focus the quantitative analysis on a particular genus, species or strain of interest.

several bacterial species are known to colonize both the gastrointestinal and the reproductive tract, and the rectum has been suggested to play an important role as a source or reservoir for organisms that colonize the vagina  <cit> . on this basis, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of a dietary supplementation with the probiotic product vsl# <dig>  a mixture of lactobacillus, bifidobacterium and streptococcus strains, on the vaginal microbiota and immunological profiles of asymptomatic healthy women during late pregnancy. the dynamics of the vaginal bacterial communities prior and after probiotic ingestion were assessed by pcr-dgge and real-time pcr, while the modulation of the cytokine secretion in vaginal fluids was measured by luminex® immunoassay. although previous studies demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of vsl# <dig> in the management of gastrointestinal disorders, especially inflammatory bowel disease  <cit> , as well as the ability of the vsl# <dig> strains to colonize the gut environment  <cit>  and to modulate the immune response of the colonic mucosa  <cit> , this is the first study that investigates the indirect effects of this probiotic formula on the vaginal microbiota.

RESULTS
bacterial population profiling with pcr-dgge
pcr-dgge analysis with universal primers for bacteria  was used to investigate:  the stability of the predominant vaginal bacterial communities over a period of  <dig> weeks in the last trimester of pregnancy, from the 33rd  to the 37th  week of gestation, and  the influence of the oral consumption of the probiotic vsl# <dig> from w <dig> to w <dig> on the predominant vaginal microbiota .

dgge band profiles displayed a relatively low complexity for both probiotic  and control  groups, as assessed by the richness index. mean values of the richness index were  <dig>  at both w <dig> and w <dig> for c group and shifted from  <dig>   to  <dig>   for p group without significant variations between w <dig> and w <dig> 

pearson correlation was used to calculate the similarity index  between dgge patterns related to the time points w <dig> and w <dig> for each pregnant woman . the si median values of p group and c group were 73% and 79%, respectively. in particular,  <dig> women belonging to p group  and only one woman belonging to c group  showed si values lower that 50%. for each woman, significant differences between dgge profiles related to w <dig> and w <dig> were searched by wilcoxon signed rank test. no significant variations were detected between w <dig> and w <dig> in control women. significant differences  were found for 5/ <dig>  women belonging to p group . interestingly, women n.  <dig> and  <dig> were the same presenting sis < 50%. these data suggested a potential role of the probiotic formula in modulating the vaginal bacterial communities. the peak heights of the dgge densitometric curves were analyzed using the wilcoxon signed rank test in order to search for significant differences in single species abundances between w <dig> and w <dig>  no significant changes in species abundance were found for both p and c groups, even in women n.  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> 

cluster analysis showed that the dgge profiles related to the time points w <dig> and w <dig> clustered together for all the control women, except for the woman n.  <dig> . four supplemented women  showed w <dig> and w <dig> dgge profiles not closely related. however, the dgge patterns of the majority of the women administered with vsl# <dig> grouped according to the subject and not to the time point, revealing that the inter-individual variability was higher than the variability induced by the probiotic supplementation.

because of the importance of lactobacilli in the establishment of a healthy vaginal environment  <cit> , dgge analysis with lactobacillus-specific primer set  was also carried out. this analysis allowed us to investigate the variations in lactobacilli population occurring physiologically from w <dig> and w <dig> and potentially associated with the vsl# <dig> intake . 

richness indexes ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>   for p group and from  <dig>   to  <dig>   for c group. mean values of si were 79% and 80% for p and c groups, respectively . only  <dig> women included in p group showed sis < 50% . wilcoxon signed rank test highlighted significant differences between dgge profiles related to w <dig> and w <dig> for women n.  <dig> and  <dig>  accounting for 13% of women included in p group. comparing this percentage with the 33% obtained by dgge analysis with hda1-gc/hda <dig> primer set, the probiotic intake seemed to have a more extended impact on total bacteria than lactobacilli. notably, only for woman n.  <dig>  significant differences were found between w33- and w37-related dgge patterns for both hda1-gc/hda <dig> and lac1/lac2-gc primer sets.

the peak height analysis by wilcoxon signed rank test allowed us to identify a band, denominated l <dig> , which significantly changed after probiotic supplementation. sequencing of the dna extracted from this band revealed 100% homology with l. helveticus strains. the nucleotide sequence of this dgge fragment was deposited in ddbj nucleotide sequence database under the accession number ab <dig>  l. helveticus was found to be a representative species within lactobacilli population since it was detected in  <dig> women supplemented with vsl# <dig> and  <dig> control women, corresponding to a frequency of occurrence of  <dig> %. notably, a general decrease in the intensity of l. helveticus band was observed in p group while no variations were appreciable in c group.

cluster analysis showed that lactobacillus-specific dgge profiles related to the time points w <dig> and w <dig> were closely related for all control women and for the majority of women administered with vsl# <dig>  except for the subjects n.  <dig> and  <dig> .

quantitative variations of vaginal bacterial populations
quantitative real-time pcr  was performed to analyze changes in concentration of lactobacillus, bifidobacterium and streptococcus thermophilus, that were included in the probiotic vsl# <dig>  and gardnerella vaginalis, atopobium, prevotella and veillonella, that are important bv-related genera and species  <cit> . qpcr efficiency for all assays was between 90% and 110% and correlation coefficients for genomic dna standards were >  <dig> . the sensitivity of qpcr assays was  <dig>  × 10- <dig>   <dig>  × 10- <dig>   <dig>  × 10- <dig>   <dig>  × 10- <dig>   <dig>  × 10- <dig>   <dig>  × 10- <dig>   <dig>  × 10- <dig> ng of target dna for lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, s. thermophilus, g. vaginalis, atopobium, prevotella and veillonella, respectively. all subjects naturally harbored strains belonging to lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, atopobium and prevotella, as demonstrated by the presence of these genera in the vaginal samples collected at w <dig>  woman n.  <dig>  was the only exception lacking lactobacilli at both the baseline and after one-month intake of vsl# <dig> . g. vaginalis was found in two women belonging to c group  at both time points at the concentration of  <dig>  ×  <dig> ±  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ×  <dig> ±  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ×  <dig> ±  <dig>  ×  <dig>  and  <dig>  ×  <dig> ±  <dig>  ×  <dig> . s. thermophilus and veillonella were not detected in any pregnant woman enrolled in this study. statistical elaboration of qpcr data related to lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, atopobium and prevotella was performed to search for significant variations of these genera associated with the going on of pregnancy or the probiotic supplementation . no significant changes in the amounts of these bacteria were found between w <dig> and w <dig> in both p and c groups. however, in spite of the lack of statistical relevance, a weak modulation was observed for bifidobacterium and atopobium. regarding bifidobacteria , a physiological tendency to decrease was observed in vaginal samples of control women at the end of the study period . this trend seemed to be counterbalanced in women consuming vsl# <dig> since amount of bifidobacteria slightly increased during the supplementation period . an opposite trend was observed for atopobium . this genus increased at w <dig>  compared to w <dig>  in c group, while it remained constant after vsl# <dig> supplementation . 

immunological profiles
the effect of the probiotic intake on the vaginal immune response was evaluated by measuring the levels of  <dig> cytokines, chemokines and growth factors in the vaginal samples of the pregnant women belonging to p and c groups.

discussion
to our knowledge, this is the first study describing the effect of a probiotic mixture, orally consumed during the last trimester of pregnancy, on the vaginal microbiota and immune response. although several health-promoting activities of probiotics have been described in relation to the gut homeostasis  <cit> , less information is available regarding the interactions between orally administered probiotic bacteria and the vaginal microbial habitat.

the first step in ascertaining the influence of the dietary supplementation with the probiotic vsl# <dig> on the vaginal microbiota of pregnant women was the characterization of vaginal bacterial communities by using an integrated approach based on pcr-dgge and qpcr.

dgge population profiling, conducted with universal primers for bacteria and lactobacillus-specific primers, allowed us to investigate the variations of the predominant vaginal bacterial communities and lactobacillus species occurring both physiologically in the last trimester of pregnancy and potentially associated with vsl# <dig> intake. the influence of the probiotic intake in modulating the predominant bacterial populations and lactobacillus species could be hypothesized since significant differences between dgge profiles at w <dig> and w <dig> were found only in women belonging to p group. notably, the lower percentage of women belonging to p group who displayed significant differences in lactobacillus-specific dgge profiles between w <dig> and w <dig>  compared to the universal bacterial dgge patterns, suggested a major stability of lactobacilli population and a more extended impact of the probiotic vsl# <dig> on total bacteria than lactobacilli. however, no significant changes in single species abundances were found between w33- and w37-related universal dgge profiles. differently, the statistical analysis of the peak heights of the lactobacillus-specific dgge densitometric curves allowed us to identify a band, corresponding to l. helveticus, which significantly decreased after probiotic supplementation. strains belonging to l. helveticus are used as starter cultures in the manufacturing of a variety of fermented dairy products, to modulate flavor. the presence of l. helveticus in vagina, likely due to the migration from the gut, can be related to a diet rich in yogurt and cheese. this work is not the first describing l. helveticus in vaginal samples. stoyancheva et al.  <cit>  identified this species among several lactobacillus isolates from vaginal fluids of healthy bulgarian women in childbearing age by using three different molecular techniques, amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis, ribotyping and pcr with species-specific primers. the decrease of l. helveticus observed in our study could be due to a competition between the lactobacillus strains present in vsl# <dig> formula and dairy l. helveticus strains in colonizing vaginal environment.

cluster analysis showed that universal and lactobacillus-specific dgge profiles related to the time points w <dig> and w <dig> of the control women were closely related. also the dgge patterns of the majority of women administered with vsl# <dig> grouped according to the subject and not to the time point, revealing that the inter-individual variability was higher than variability induced by the probiotic supplementation.

the hypothesis of a positive action of vsl# <dig> on the vaginal microbiota of pregnant women was further supported by qpcr results, which suggested a role of the probiotic product in counteracting the decrease of the health-promoting bifidobacterium genus and the increase of the bv-related atopobium genus, that occurred in control women during late pregnancy. notably, group b streptococcus, which was found in two women  before the probiotic intake, was no longer found after the dietary supplementation .

the second step of the present research was the investigation of the vaginal immunological profiles of the pregnant women in order to search for correlations between the vsl# <dig> intake and changes in vaginal immune response. pregnancy has been referred to as a state of relative immune compromise. this notion has been related to both demonstration of depression of certain aspects of cell-mediated immunity and clinical observations of an increased severity of numerous infectious conditions in pregnant women  <cit> . on the other hand, preterm cervical ripening can be likened to an inflammatory process with cytokines as important mediators  <cit> .

bioplex immunoassay was used in the present work to measure levels of  <dig> cytokines, chemokines and growth factors in the vaginal samples of the pregnant women belonging to p and c groups. in group c a significant reduction at w <dig> was found for il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig> and rantes. il- <dig> is a key regulator in humoral and adaptive immunity. it has many biological roles, including the stimulation of activated b-cells and t-cell proliferation, and the differentiation of cd4+ t-cells into th <dig> cells. a regulatory role is also exerted by il- <dig>  in relation to pregnancy, il- <dig> decreases the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as il- <dig>  il- <dig>  tnfα, il-1β and prostaglandin e <dig> in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated fetal membranes  <cit> . both il- <dig> and il- <dig> are produced by th <dig> cells. il- <dig> and il- <dig> are hematopoietic growth factors that act as regulators of cell survival, proliferation and homeostasis of a variety of hematopoietic cells. rantes is a potent and versatile chemokine, capable of attracting monocytes, lymphocytes, basophils and eosinophils. this cytokine has been implicated in the regulation of the inflammatory response and recruitment of macrophages to the implantation site in early pregnancy  <cit> . however, no variations in rantes levels have been associated with preterm cervical ripening and labor  <cit> . immunological profiles related to women belonging to c group indicated that some fluctuations in vaginal immune-modulators occurred physiologically during the last trimester of pregnancy. in particular, it is noteworthy the decrease of il- <dig> and il- <dig>  important regulatory cytokines controlling the inflammatory reaction responsible for uterine contractions and cervical ripening at the labor time  <cit> . in p group a significant variation was registered only for the chemokine eotaxin, which decreased after probiotic supplementation. eotaxin selectively recruits eosinophils, and for this reason is implicated in allergic responses  <cit> . by comparing the data related to the two study groups, the following hypotheses could be formulated regarding the possible impact of the probiotic intake on cytokine secretion during late pregnancy:  probiotics counteracted the decrease of anti-inflammatory cytokine levels occurring in c group;  probiotics induced the decrease of a pro-inflammatory cytokine in p group, showing a global anti-inflammatory effect on the vaginal immunity. in addition, a stabilization effect on the vaginal immunity during late pregnancy could be attributed to the probiotic intake, since the percentage of women with modified amounts of immune-mediators decreased from 67% to 31% in relation to the dietary supplementation.

CONCLUSIONS
the impact of the oral intake of the probiotic vsl# <dig> on the vaginal microbiota and immune response of pregnant women was investigated by molecular fingerprinting techniques  and luminex® immunoassay. the major findings of this study are the following:  vsl# <dig> intake seems to be associated with a modulation of the predominant vaginal bacterial communities;  vsl# <dig> modulation of lactobacillus population appears to be related to variations of l. helveticus species;  a potential role of the probiotic product in counteracting the physiological decrease of bifidobacterium and increase of atopobium could be hypothesized;  the probiotic supplementation can be associated with a global anti-inflammatory effect on the vaginal immunity, with potential implications in preventing preterm birth.
