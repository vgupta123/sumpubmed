BACKGROUND
the pig is an important agricultural animal and is an excellent mammalian model for biomedical research  <cit> . h. parasuis is the etiological agent of porcine polyserositis and arthritis  characterized by fibrinous polyserositis, meningitis and polyarthritis, causing severe economic losses to the swine industry  <cit> . to date,  <dig> serovars of h. parasuis have been identified  <cit> . h. parasuis infection can be acute or chronic, depending on the immunological status of the herd  <cit> . the infection by h. parasuis has become an increasing threat to early-weaned pigs and in pig herds of high health status  <cit> .

the innate immune response in vertebrates is the first defense line against invading microorganisms. the main players in innate immunity are phagocytes such as neutrophils, dendritic cells and macrophages  <cit> . as a major component of the host innate immunity, macrophages have essential roles in host defense to infection, because they often mediate the killing of microbes as well as initiate, maintain and resolve host inflammatory responses by releasing cytokines and chemokines  <cit> . bacterial pathogens that overcome host defenses ensure their ability to survive and propagate  <cit> . the diversity of bacteria and the differences in their pathogenesis may lead to pathogen-specific responses of macrophages  <cit> . a greater understanding of the complex interactions, which occur between the macrophages and pathogen, could lead to the identification of the host defense strategies and the complementary pathogen evasion strategies  <cit> . the interactions between h. parasuis with porcine alveolar macrophages have been studied  <cit> , but the detailed mechanisms of how porcine alveolar macrophages response to h. parasuis infection are not well elucidated. the high throughput cdna microarray represents a powerful tool for analyzing the molecular events in bacteria-host cell interactions  <cit> . this technology has been useful in identifying changes in gene expression both in cultured cells and in whole organisms infected with pathogens  <cit> . in this study, we applied this high throughput cdna microarray assay to improve our understanding of the innate immune response of macrophages to h. parasuis infection.

RESULTS
clinical evaluation of infected pigs
in the challenge group, at  <dig> h post-infection, all three pigs had a rectal temperature of over  <dig> °c and displayed lateral recumbency or labored breathing. at  <dig> h post-infection, all pigs including three control pigs were euthanized by intravenous administration of an overdose of sodium pentobarbital. in the challenge group, severe fibrinous polyserositis, arthritis and meningitis were observed at necropsy. on the other hand, in the control group, three pigs remained clinically normal throughout the experiment and did not have lesions at necropsy. the detection of h. parasuis by bacterial isolation, nested pcr and lamp in different samples are shown in table  <dig>  the results indicated that the h. parasuis could be detected in the lymph nodes, lungs and spleen in all of the three pigs that challenged with h. parasuis serovar  <dig> sh <dig> strain. in contrast, h. parasuis could not be detected by the three methods in the control group.

a: if h. parasuis was not identified by culture due to contaminated overgrowth, presence of h. parasuis was checked by nested pcr and lamp on a colony sweep.

overview of differential expressed genes in pams
to investigate the dynamic gene transcriptional profiles of pams in response to h. parasuis infection, six microarrays were used in this experiment, corresponding to the rnas from pams of three h. parasuis infected piglets and three controls. the total rna samples were hybridized with affymetrix genechip porcine genome array, and the microarray data were analyzed using significance analysis of microarrays   <cit> . hybridization results indicated that  <dig>  and  <dig>  probes sets, corresponding to  <dig> % and  <dig> % of all probe sets, were detected in h. parasuis serovar  <dig> and mock-infected pams . after quantile normalization and statistical analysis,  <dig> transcripts were identified at sam |score| ≥  <dig>  furthermore, genes whose relative transcription levels showed a fold change fc ≥  <dig>  and sam |score| ≥  <dig> were considered to be up-regulated, and those with an fc ≤  <dig>  and sam |score| ≥  <dig> were considered to be down-regulated. in this study,  <dig> transcripts showed a level of expression that differed significantly from that of the control group with h. parasuis serovar  <dig> sh <dig> strain infected group. these included  <dig> genes annotated with david or by searching against the genbank database . among these,  <dig> genes were up-regulated and  <dig> genes were down-regulated .

the functions of the de genes were analyzed by molecular annotation system  <dig>  software http://www.capitabio.com <cit> . in the mas  <dig>  tool, the go terms and kegg pathways are ranked with statistical significance by calculating their p-values based on hypergeometric distribution  <cit> . go terms and kegg pathways with p-values less than  <dig>  are considered statistically significant  <cit> . among the  <dig> annotated genes, a total of  <dig> genes were grouped into  <dig> categories based on biological process gene ontology  terms with the p-values less than  <dig>  . several go terms were associated with the immune system. these were "inflammatory response" , "immune response" , "complement activation, classical pathway"  and "leukocyte migration" . particularly, the de genes associated with immune and inflammatory response suggested that they play roles in host defense response to h. parasuis infection . to gain insight into the different biological processes of h. parasuis infection, a pathway analysis by kegg database was performed on de genes   <cit> . the significant pathways mainly contained: cell adhesion molecules , cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction , complement and coagulation cascades , toll-like receptor signaling pathway , mapk signaling pathway , which suggested that the host took different strategies to activate immune and inflammatory response upon h. parasuis infection.

validation of microarray data by quantitative real-time pcr 
in order to confirm the statistical significance of our findings, we performed quantitative real-time pcr  analysis of the relevant genes in our original samples used in microarray study. eleven genes were selected for qpcr analysis. ten selected genes that were up-regulated in microarray also showed significantly higher expression in h. parasuis serovar  <dig> infected samples than in the control samples determined by qpcr analysis. the ppp1r13l gene that was down-regulated in microarray data also showed significantly lower expression in h. parasuis serovar  <dig> infected samples than in the control samples by qpcr .

string analysis of the relationships between de genes
string is a web-based interface that could predict protein associations which can mean direct physical binding and can also mean indirect interaction such as participation in the same metabolic pathway or cellular process on the basis of genomic context, high-throughput experiments, co-expression and data from the literature http://string.embl.de <cit> . de genes were analyzed using string for predicting network of proteins encoded by de genes. among the  <dig> annotated de genes,  <dig> genes containing  <dig> up-regulated genes and  <dig> down-regulated genes were eligible to string analyses when the sus scrofa database was chosen. in order to seek the possibility of the associations between de genes, the combined score of  <dig>  was chosen. the network of predicted associations for all of the de genes encoded proteins are shown in additional file  <dig>  some molecules are the key molecules that link to other proteins according to the string analysis. however, many proteins do not link to others, indicating that their functions are unrelated or unknown. as shown in figure 2a, a total of  <dig> de genes encoded proteins are associated with il-1β according to the textmining evidence, and they form the il-1β network. furthermore, the cd <dig> and sod <dig> are associated with il-1β according to the co-expression evidence. two of phagocytosis-related genes  are associated with a total of  <dig> de genes encoded proteins  according to the textmining evidence, and they form the phagocytosis network. furthermore, the il-1β, fgl- <dig>  ccl <dig> and fcgr2β are associated with cd <dig> according to the co-expression evidence.

identification of novel infection-related de genes
in order to identify novel candidates for disease-related de genes, we evaluated the de genes that were not highlighted in the kegg or string analysis. although the s100a <dig>  s100a <dig> and coronin 1a were not highlighted in the kegg or string analysis, they were found to play roles in the immune response  <cit> . these observations suggest that the three genes may be novel candidates for disease-related de genes.

among the three genes, coronin 1a has not been identified in pigs before. so we cloned and sequenced the porcine coronin 1a gene according to description of liu et al  <cit>  and the sequence was submitted to the genbank . the full-length cdna of porcine coronin 1a contains  <dig> bp and  <dig> amino acid residues. multiple sequence alignment with the identified coronin 1a of cattle, human, mouse, rat and the predicted coronin 1a of other species showed that the nucleotide sequence of the pocoronin 1a orf is  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % identical to that of panda, cattle, human, chimpanzee, northern white-cheeked gibbon, common marmoset, mouse and rat coronin 1a, respectively. at the amino acid level, the corresponding identities were  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. to define the molecular evolutionary history of pocoronin 1a, protein sequences from  <dig> vertebrates were obtained to construct a phylogenetic tree. phylogenetic analysis showed that pocoronin 1a belongs to the group containing the bos taurus sequence . structural analysis with the expasy server http://expasy.org/ indicated that the pocoronin 1a contains putative domains of trp-asp  repeats signature, trp-asp  repeats profile and trp-asp  repeats circular profile at the n-terminus .

expression analyses of s100a <dig>  s100a <dig> in pk <dig> cells stimulated with lps and poly 
in order to investigate the expression patterns of s100a <dig> and s100a <dig> under general conditions that mimic bacterial and viral infection, the immunostimulation assay was carried out in pk- <dig> cells by using the lps and poly  as the stimulators.

overnight cultures of pk- <dig> cells were treated with  <dig> μg/ml lps or  <dig> μg/ml poly  for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h. lps and poly  stimulation did not induce expression of porcine s100a <dig> until  <dig> h . lps stimulation induced expression of s100a <dig> at  <dig> h and  <dig> h, after which s100a <dig> expression dropped and plateaued for 24- <dig> h . after poly  stimulation, the expression of s100a <dig> reached the peak at  <dig> h, after which s100a <dig> expression dropped at  <dig> h, and the up-regulation of s100a <dig> was again observed at  <dig> h . these observations indicate that both lps and poly  can induce the expression of porcine s100a <dig> and s100a <dig> in vitro.

in vivo expression of s100a <dig> and s100a <dig> in pigs with systemic infection of h. parasuis
in order to understand the expression of the s100a <dig> and s100a <dig> in pigs with systemic infection of h. parasuis, the different tissues obtained from the h. parasuis infected pigs and the controls were selected for the qpcr analysis. our qpcr examination demonstrated that the increasing expression of s100a <dig> was observed in the lungs, spleen and lymph nodes of pigs infected with h. parasuis for  <dig> days . the expression of s100a <dig> in the lungs, spleen and lymph nodes had the same expression tendencies . however, in brain and heart of h. parasuis infected pigs, the expression of s100a <dig> and s100a <dig> did not show significant changes compared to the controls.

discussion
during infection, h. parasuis has to reach the lung and survive the host pulmonary defenses before invading the blood stream  <cit> . in the lung, bacteria have to confront alveolar macrophages, whose main roles include: ingestion of bacteria by phagocytosis, destruction of bacteria within phagolysosomes and recruitment of inflammatory cells to the site of infection via chemokines and acute-phase proteins  <cit> .

phagocytosis is a cytoskeleton-dependent process of engulfment of large particles, and macrophages could present a restricted number of phagocytic receptors that induce rearrangements in the actin cytoskeleton that lead to the internalization of the particle  <cit> . phagocytosis is a key mechanism used by macrophages to control virulent pasteurellaceae, such as pasteurella multocida, haemophilus parasuis, haemophilus influenzae, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae  <cit> . in this study, the cd <dig>  <cit> , hmox <dig>  <cit> , fcgr2β  <cit>  and abca <dig>  <cit>  genes, which were identified as de genes, were also found to be involved in the phagocytosis. meanwhile, the string analysis indicated that many de gene encoded proteins could interact with cd <dig> and fcgr2β molecules, suggesting that pams may upregulate these genes to facilitate the phagocytosis of h. parasuis or other cells to play their immunological roles.

one of the important mechanisms used by macrophage to play its immunological functions is to kill bacteria by the activation and recruitment of antibacterial effectors to the phagolysosome  <cit> . the fusion of phagosomes with lysosomes results in the formation of phagolysosomes  <cit> . in our study, we found two de genes that were related to the formation of phagolysosome, that is, smpd <dig>  <cit>  and coronin 1a  <cit> . interestingly, many groups have reported that the coronin 1a could prevent lysosomal delivery and allow the bacteria to survive intracellularly  <cit> . in the course of infection, h. parasuis has to survive from the host pulmonary defense, such as alveolar macrophages, to produce disease. in this way, the up-regulation of coronin 1a gene may facilitate the h. parasuis in producing the disease.

interleukin- <dig> beta  is an important inflammation-associated gene that is up-regulated in many microarray experiments  <cit> . interestingly, wilkinson et al reported that an increase in il-1β gene expression is observed in h. parasuis-infected lungs  <cit> . in our study, il-1β was also up-regulated in h. parasuis-infected pams. unsurprisingly, string analysis also revealed that many molecules encoded by up-regulated genes interact with il-1β and form the il-1β network. meanwhile, the pathway analysis indicated that il-1β is in some pathways, such as cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction , mapk signaling pathway , and toll-like receptor signaling pathway . ccl5/rantes plays an important role in regulating the movements of inflammatory cells to the infection sites  <cit> . many viruses, such as japanese encephalitis virus   <cit> , respiratory syncytial virus   <cit> , influenza virus a  <cit>  and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus   <cit>  have been shown to induce ccl <dig>  in addition, some papers have reported that the ccl <dig> could be induced in macrophages by bacterial infections, such as salmonella typhimurium infection, streptococcus pyogenes infection and lactobacillus rhamnosus infection  <cit> . interestingly, in our study, the up-regulation of ccl <dig> was observed in h. parasuis-infected pams, which suggested that ccl <dig> plays a role in the host response against h. parasuis infection. thus, during the h. parasuis infection, the pams mount a powerful inflammatory response in an effort to clear this pathogen. alternatively, the influx of inflammatory cells to the site of infection may provide additional host cells for h. parasuis infection. however, sustained or excessive production of inflammatory cytokines can have damaging consequences. to counterbalance inflammatory cytokines, anti-inflammatory cytokines are produced. anti-inflammatory cytokines include interleukin  <dig> , transforming growth factor β , and il- <dig> receptor antagonist   <cit> . wilkinson et al reported that the il-1β and its antagonist, il-1ra are both more highly expressed in "susceptible" animals challenged with h. parasuis  <cit> . in our study, tgf-β, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, was increased in h. parasuis infection group. during h. parasuis infection, anti-inflammatory signals may decrease the potentially damaging effects of proinflammatory cytokines on host tissue.

macrophage also effectively controls bacterial infection by producing of reactive species such as oxygen species and nitric oxide . sustained production of no endows macrophages with cytostatic or cytotoxic activity against viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, helminths and tumor cells. unsurprisingly, h. parasuis infection could cause up-regulated expression of a large set of genes involved in the nitric oxide production. these genes were: spr, rora, klrk <dig>  sod <dig> and il-1β  <cit> . the up-regulated genes related to the nitric oxide production may contribute to the pam for confronting h. parasuis infection.

the de genes that are related to phagocytosis, formation of phagolysosome, chemokines production, and nitric oxide production may help us to better understand the complicated mechanisms by which pams play their functions. another highlight of our study is the new identified candidate genes that may be implicated in the pathogenesis of glässer's disease. these genes could help to screen the potential host agents for reducing the prevalence of h. parasuis and further understand the molecular pathogenesis associated with h. parasuis infection in pigs. these genes are: s100a <dig>  s100a <dig>  caveolin  <dig> and ppp1r13l.

s <dig> a <dig> and s <dig> a <dig> belong to the s <dig> family that contained  <dig> ef-hand calcium-binding motifs  <cit> . two of s <dig> family genes  are dramatically up-regulated in spleen and lung following h. parasuis infection  <cit> . meanwhile, many other s <dig> family genes are up-regulated following different bacterial and viral infection  <cit> , suggesting that the s <dig> family genes play roles in the immune response to infections. in our study, the s <dig> calcium-binding protein a <dig> and a <dig> were up-regulated after h. parasuis infection when determined by microarray and qpcr. further immunostimulation analysis indicated that the mrna levels of s <dig> calcium-binding protein a <dig>  and s <dig> calcium-binding protein a <dig>  in porcine pk- <dig> cells increased within  <dig> h and were sustained after administration of lps and poly  respectively. we also found that the s100a <dig> and s100a <dig> genes were up-regulated in lungs, spleen and lymph nodes in h. parasuis infected pigs. interestingly, the kidney fibrosis  <cit> , liver fibrosis  <cit> , lung fibrosis  <cit> , cardiac fibrosis  <cit>  and peritoneal fibrosis  <cit>  are found to be related to the expression of s100a <dig>  glässer's disease is characterized mainly by fibrinous polyserositis, meningitis, and arthritis. in this way, we hypothesized that the increase expression of s100a <dig> may underlie fibrosis during h. parasuis infection in pigs. meanwhile, some reports indicated that s100a <dig> plays roles in cell proliferation and signaling transduction  <cit> . therefore, the s100a <dig> and s100a <dig> genes could be two novel genes related to h. parasuis infection.

caveolins are the major components and protein markers of caveolae that are 50- <dig> nm invaginations of membrane. the caveolin gene family includes three members in vertebrates, caveolin- <dig>  caveolin- <dig> and caveolin- <dig>  of which caveolin  <dig> and caveolin  <dig> have been detected in mouse macrophages  <cit> . caveolin  <dig> molecule is related to h. parasuis infection  <cit> . caveolin  <dig>  which localizes to the golgi complex but redistributes to plasma membrane, caveolae and rafts when co-expressed with caveolin  <dig>  is a potential key molecule related to the pseudomonas infection causing pneumonia in patients with cystic fibrosis and other immunocompromising conditions  <cit> . in our study, the caveolin  <dig> gene was highly expressed in pam isolated from the h. parasuis serovar  <dig> challenged group. therefore, in addition to the caveolin  <dig> gene, the caveolin  <dig> gene may be a novel candidate gene related to h. parasuis infection.

the nf-kappa b  signaling pathway is important in signal transduction during the innate immune response  <cit> . nf-κb signaling relies on the targeting of iκb  subunit to the proteasome to allow nf-κb to translocate from the cytosol to the nucleus where it activates gene transcription  <cit> . the ppp1r13l is mentioned as a novel inhibitor of nf-κb  <cit> . in our study, microarray and qpcr analysis indicated that the mrna of ppp1r13l was down-regulated significantly compared to control. the ipa network indicated that the ppp1r13l could directly or indirectly interacts with many molecules, such as micro rnas, transcriptions, enzymes, and cytokines , suggesting that ppp1r13l gene is an innate immune related gene that plays a role in pam during h. parasuis infection. the detailed mechanism of ppp1r13l gene in nf-κb signaling pathway in h. parasuis infected pam needs further studies.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first study focusing on response of porcine alveolar macrophages to haemophilus parasuis by using the affymetrix genechip porcine genome array. although great efforts have been made to understand the molecular basis of h. parasuis infection, the cellular response to h. parasuis infection is still largely unknown. the high-density cdna array technology to analysis of h. parasuis-infected pam could improve our understanding of the h. parasuis infection. our data show that a series of genes are activated upon h. parasuis infection. these genes are involved in inflammatory response, immune response, microtubule polymerization, regulation of transcript and signal transduction. particularly, some genes related to phagocytosis, formation of phagolysosome, chemokines production and nitric oxide production could contribute to explain the complicated mechanisms by which pam played its functions. some new identified genes may also provide implication on the pathogenesis of glässer's disease caused by h. parasuis.
