BACKGROUND
during expression of protein-coding genes, pre-mrnas are transcribed in the nucleus and undergo several rna-processing steps. the mature mrna is then exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm for translation. nuclear export of mrna composes one part of a larger network of molecular events that begin with transcription of the mrna in the nucleus and end with its translation and degradation in the cytoplasm. the trex  complex is conserved in evolution from yeast to man and is required for coupled transcription elongation and nuclear export of mrnas  <cit> . the trex complex in mammals and drosophila is composed of the tho  subcomplex   <dig>  thoc <dig>  thoc <dig>  thoc <dig> and thoc7), thoc <dig>  uap <dig> and aly/thoc <dig>  <cit> . however, the tho complex components are not essential for bulk poly  + rna export in higher eukaryotes  <cit> . furthermore, the nuclear export of only a subset of mrnas is affected by depletion of a member of the tho complex  <cit> . these data suggest that various nuclear mrna export pathways, which may be indicated by different adaptor rna binding proteins, exist in higher eukaryotes. recent data show that aly and thoc <dig> function in the tip associating protein -p <dig> mediated nuclear export of hsp <dig> mrna  <cit> . it was demonstrated that the depletion of thoc <dig> does not affect bulk poly + rna export, but does affect hsp <dig> mrna export in hela cells. interestingly, the deletion of thoc <dig>  a major conserved component of tho complex, causes apoptosis in transformed cells, but not in normal fibroblasts  <cit> . furthermore, the embryonic development of the conventional thoc <dig> knockout mice is arrested around the time of implantation  <cit> , suggesting that the tho complex may play an essential role in early development.

fms interacting protein  was originally identified as a substrate for the macrophage colony stimulating factor  receptor tyrosine kinase, fms  <cit> . fmip has been demonstrated to be a member of tho complex, thoc <dig>  <cit> . we have previously shown that depletion of thoc5/fmip by sirna or ectopic expression causes abnormal hematopoiesis and abnormal adipocyte differentiation in myeloid progenitor or mesenchymal progenitor cell lines, indicating that the tho-complex is essential for the differentiation process in mammals  <cit> .

in this study we show that thoc5/fmip is essential at an early stage of murine development. furthermore, using interferon inducible thoc5/fmip knockout mice we demonstrated that this gene is essential for survival. in these mice, bone marrow and spleen cells became apoptotic, hematopoietic progenitor cell numbers collapsed and the animals became anemic. although the thoc5/fmip gene was deleted in liver, kidney, and heart, pathological alterations to these organs were not observed. furthermore,  <dig> out of  <dig> thoc5/fmip depleted mice survived over two months by normal bone marrow cell transplantation with no apparent symptoms.

RESULTS
thoc5/fmip is essential at an early stage of mouse development
to examine the role of thoc5/fmip in vivo, we first generated a floxed thoc5/fmip allele  by recombination in embryonic stem  cells  <cit> . given that the thoc5/fmip gene spans  <dig> exons in a  <dig>  kb region on chromosome  <dig>  we adopted a targeting strategy where, by flanking exons iv and v with loxp sites, we could inactivate thoc5/fmip in a conditional manner . the deletion of exons iv/v of thoc5/fmip causes a frame shift of product and the truncated protein is expected to be only  <dig> amino acids long and lacking the thoc <dig> binding domain  <cit> . es cells were used to establish a thoc5/fmip flox strain . homozygous thoc5/fmip  mice were fertile and did not display any phenotypic or histological abnormalities, showing that the two loxp sites in the thoc5/fmip flox locus did not affect its function. first, we bred thoc5/fmip floxed mice to eiia-cre mice in which cre is ubiquitously expressed  <cit> . after generation of heterozygote mice , we bred f <dig> mice and generated f <dig> mice. we did not detect any thoc5/fmip-/- newborn mice from f <dig> mice. in addition, the genotype of  <dig> embryos collected between e <dig>  and e <dig>  was determined by the exon iv/v specific pcr analysis of genomic dna. of  <dig> embryos which we examined, none was thoc5/fmip-/- indicating that loss of thoc5/fmip causes embryonic lethality before e <dig> . among  <dig> embryos,  <dig> were thoc5/fmip +/+ and  <dig> were +/- which was the expected mendelian ratio . thoc5/fmip +/- mice were indistinguishable from wild type.

to examine thoc5/fmip depletion in adult mice, thoc5/fmip  and cre-deleter mice expressing cre-recombinase  under the control of the interferon-inducible mx promoter   <cit>  were crossed to obtain animals that carry the thoc5/fmip allele and mx-cre gene ).

thoc5/fmip expression is reduced in specific organs
the deletion mutation of thoc5/fmip was induced by poly  injection. we first injected six-week-old mx-cre thoc5/fmip   with  <dig> μg of poly  three times, at two to three day intervals. mx-cre thoc5/fmip  mice  were sacrificed before and two  injection), four  injection) and seven  injection) days after the first poly  injection and genomic dnas were extracted from liver, spleen and bone marrow. genomic dnas were used for the determination of exon iv/v deletion by pcr using 5'-tgctggcattgaactgtg-3' and 5'-cagcactggagcgggagatgt-3' . to our surprise, pcr product lacking exons vi/v  was detected in all organs after one × poly  injection in all cases .

then, we injected six-week-old mx-cre thoc5/fmip   and control thoc5/fmip  mice with  <dig> μg of poly  three times, at two to three days intervals. mx-cre thoc5/fmip   and control thoc5/fmip  mice were sacrificed at four and seven days after the first poly  injection and proteins were extracted from liver, spleen, kidney, lung, intestine, testicles and bone marrow. it has been reported that the treatment of the interferon mediated cre-inducible mice with poly  causes deletion of the target gene only in particular organs, such as liver and spleen, and to a lesser extent in heart and kidney  <cit> .

we examined, therefore, the thoc5/fmip protein level in liver, spleen, kidney, lung, intestine, testicles and bone marrow using thoc5/fmip specific antibody and western blot  <cit> . after poly  injection, the level of thoc5/fmip is reduced by approximately 80% in liver , kidney , heart  and bone marrow  within seven days in all mx-cre thoc5/fmip  mice. in contrast, in spleen, intestine, testes and lung, the level is not reduced .

deletion of thoc5/fmip gene causes death within two weeks
since conventional knockout mice died at the embryonic stage, we determined whether thoc5/fmip is necessary for postnatal mouse survival. we therefore injected three-day-old mice  with  <dig> μg of poly  three times at two-to-three-day intervals. mx-cre thoc5/fmip mice began dying three days after injection and then all died within  <dig> days after the first injection, whereas all control mice ) survived . we then injected  <dig> μg of poly  into nine-week-old mice  three times over a two-to-three-day interval. these mice began dying eight days after the first poly  injection and all of them were dead within  <dig> days , indicating that thoc5/fmip gene expression is essential for the survival of adult mice.

to determine the pathology underlying gene knockout-induced death we analyzed specific organs and determined the weight of body, liver and spleen of five to six-week-old mx-cre thoc5/fmip   and thoc5/fmip   mice before and after three times  <dig> μg poly  treatment. no significant differences were found in the weight of body or liver between poly -treated and -untreated mice or between mx-cre thoc5/fmip  and control thoc5/fmip mice seven days after poly  injection . although there was no depression of thoc5/fmip expression level, within seven days spleen weight of all mx-cre thoc5/fmip  mice dropped to 50%  of that in non-treated or control mice . we next examined the histopathology of organs from the same mice  injection), including, liver, heart, spleen and kidney.

although white and red pulp in spleen are clearly present, periarterial lymphoid sheath  which includes the t-cell cuffs around the arteries and b-cell follicles appear to be reduced in favor of a parafollicular lymphocytic population which is interspersed more evenly in the red pulp. throughout the organ, there are a few spots of proliferatively activated lymphoid cells . immunohistochemical staining using the cleaved caspase  <dig> specific antibody revealed that there were clearly more cleaved caspase  <dig> positive cells in clusters underneath the capsule  in mx-cre thoc5/fmip  spleen than in control spleen . in addition, no cleaved caspase  <dig> positive cells were observed in the red pulp, suggesting that some subpopulation of lymphocytic cells may be affected. furthermore, liver, heart, and kidney, from thoc5/fmip depleted mice were histologically normal throughout a  <dig> day period after poly  injection. although the liver looked pale in these mice, no abnormalities were observed and no cleaved caspase  <dig> positive cells were seen in this organ , suggesting that thoc5/fmip depleted mice may have anemia, and/or internal bleeding.

given the association of spleen with hematopoietic cells we then examined peripheral blood and bone marrow.

thoc5/fmip deletion causes severe leukocytopenia and anemia
blood was taken from the tail vein of five-to-six-week old mx-cre thoc5/fmip   and thoc5/fmip   mice on  <dig> , four ), seven ), and  <dig> to  <dig> days ) and examined. in agreement with previous reports, poly  injection induces slight leukocytopenia and thrombocytopenia in control mice within four days  <cit> , however  <dig> to  <dig> days after poly  treatment, the number of leukocytes and platelets in control mice returned to normal . in thoc5/fmip depleted mice, the number of leukocytes and platelets continued to decrease. after seven days, peripheral blood from most of the mice contained platelet numbers less than  <dig> × 103/mm <dig>  13%  of that seen in control mice after injection of poly . simultaneously, we observed subdermal bleeding in these mice and within  <dig> days after the first poly  injection, all mice showed a further reduction of leukocytes and platelets . in addition, the erythrocyte count, hemoglobin and hematocrit levels went down to  <dig> to  <dig> × 106/mm <dig> , 3- <dig> g/dl , 13% , respectively, suggesting that thoc5/fmip depleted mice died from hematological disorders such as anemia, and internal bleeding. these data also agree with the observation that liver and spleen in thoc5/fmip deleted mice appear pale.

depression of thoc5/fmip gene causes cell apoptosis in bone marrow, but not of hepatocytes
as severe leukocytopenia and anemia were observed in thoc5/fmip depleted mice, we examined the bone marrow cells after induced depletion of thoc5/fmip protein. bone marrow cells from five to six-week-old mice were flushed from femora zero, four or seven days after the first  <dig> μg poly  injection . cytospin preparations were stained by may grunwald solution and hematoxylin. although after four days we did not detect any difference in morphology of bone marrow cells, after seven days it became apparent that few hematoxylin-stained cells were present in samples from mx-cre thoc5/fmip mice . a high proportion of those cells that were present showed dense chromatin staining, reminiscent of apoptotic cells. to examine whether the cells that survived were apoptotic more than  <dig>  4', 6-diamidino-2-phenyindole  positive bone marrow cells were co-stained with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dutp nick end labeling  and dapi for each preparation. two and four percent respectively of dapi positive bone marrow cells in control thoc5/fmip mice are stained with tunel in the presence or in the absence of poly  treatment . in mx-cre thoc5/fmip mice, 15% of bone marrow cells are stained without poly injection, possibly as a result of the natural presence of interferons. after three poly  injections, only a few dapi positive cells are left and all remaining cells were stained with tunel , suggesting that deletion of thoc5/fmip causes bone marrow cell apoptosis. furthermore, no significant increase of tunel positive cells  was observed, suggesting that apoptotic cells may fail to stay in bone marrow or be phagocytosed. dna laddering, indicative of apoptosis, in bone marrow cells and hepatocytes was also examined. we detected dna fragmentation associated with apoptosis from the poly  injected bone marrow cells, but not from the liver of the same mouse .

many erythrocytes are still present in bone marrow after seven days. given their extended lifetime compared to white cells it is probable that the steady decrease in their numbers is due to decreased rates of blood cell production in the marrow.

the half life of erythrocytes in mice is about  <dig> days  <cit> . the extent of the effect we observe  argues for dysfunctional erythropoiesis as the causal effect. however both white cell and red cell numbers are depleted. therefore the lesion leading to death may be associated with hematopoiesis.

hematopoietic progenitor cell populations are depleted upon thoc5/fmip deletion
the marrow hypoplasia observed in mx-cre thoc5/fmip  mice after poly  injection led us to consider the effects on hematopoietic progenitor cells and a population enriched for primitive hematopoietic cells including long-term reconstituting cells. to examine hematopoietic progenitor cells, bone marrow cells were isolated from mice four days after poly  injection. since we could obtained more consistent data from mice treated with  <dig> ×  <dig> μg than mice treated with  <dig> ×  <dig> μg at this time point, we injected five to six-week-old mx-cre thoc5/fmip   and thoc5/fmip   mice with  at a two-day interval) in this experiment.

first we determined femoral cellularity which was found to be depressed in mx-cre thoc5/fmip  mice treated with poly  . the same samples were then taken for assessment of primitive hematopoietic cell numbers. we determined the total number of cells which were not expressing lineage markers for mature hematopoietic cells, a measure of progenitor cells present in the marrow. the lin- cells were depleted to a greater extent in thoc5/fmip depleted animals than in control animals . we therefore assessed multipotent colony forming cell numbers in soft gel assays. we could detect no gemm-cfu   in thoc5/fmip depleted murine femora whilst they were present in both control populations assayed. similarly, granulocyte macrophage colony forming cells  were undetectable in thoc5/fmip depleted bone marrow but were present in control femora . the effect of poly  injection in mx-cre thoc5/fmip mice on primitive multipotent colony forming cells, gemm-cfu, and gm-cfu is therefore a profound reduction. furthermore, an analysis of the lineage marker depleted, sca+, kit+  cell numbers present in the bone marrow revealed that the proportion of lsk cells  was not substantially changed when mx-cre thoc5/fmip mice were treated with poly . however the total number of these cells per femur was decreased by 80% per femur. this argues for primitive hematopoietic cells as well as lineage specific progenitor cells being depleted as a consequence of thoc5/fmip knockout.

as detailed the lineage marker negative cell population, generally considered a progenitor cell cohort, was reduced by 92% by poly  treatment of mx-cre thoc5/fmip mice  and myeloid progenitors are decreased. furthermore, lineage marker depleted sca- kit+ cell population which consists largely of erythroid progenitors  <cit>  was also decreased by 98% . we envisage the stem cell compartment is apparently radically but slightly less affected  as it turns over more slowly than rapidly cycling progenitor cell populations. these data are consistent with a failure of hematopoiesis in the stem cell and progenitor cell compartments as a result of fmip levels falling in hematopoietic cells.

a transfer of normal bone marrow cells rescued 70% of mice from death by thoc5/fmip depletion
although thoc5/fmip was depleted in liver, kidney, heart and bone marrow, the only evident phenotype alteration was observed in bone marrow cells. it may be explained that thoc5/fmip depletion displays a phenotype first in this fast turnover tissue that is very dependent on stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. hematopoietic cells especially white cells such as neutrophils turn over rapidly, and it is in keeping with observations on the sensitivity of hematopoiesis insult such as irradiation or cytotoxic drugs that the first major signs of thoc5/fmip removal are observed in bone marrow derived cells. the question rose as to whether other organs, such as liver, kidney and heart would have shown pathological alterations if the mice had survived for longer periods. therefore, we examined next whether a transfer of normal bone marrow cells rescues thoc5/fmip depleted mice. we transferred  <dig> bone marrow cells derived from thoc5/fmip mice into nonablated mx-cre thoc5/fmip mice via i.v. and a day after transplantation we injected recipient mice with poly , followed by two additional injections. nine out of  <dig> mice survived longer than two months and no symptoms were observed . furthermore, the exon iv/v of thoc5/fmip gene was deleted completely from liver genomic dna of survivors , indicating that cre-recombinase was expressed by poly  injection in liver. although thoc5/fmip expression was drastically down-regulated in the livers of survivors, histological abnormalities were not observed in liver, kidney and heart. cytospin preparations revealed that only few hematoxylin-stained cells were present in samples from four bone-marrow-recipient mice which died , while normal populations of hematoxylin-stained cells with few apoptotic cells were present in samples from survivors . the phenotype of the non-survivors is identical  to that of non-recipient mice, suggesting that bone marrow transplantation did not work in these mice. it may be related to the fact that the bone marrow cell transplantation was performed into nonablated mice. in some case, there may be no open space for donor cells  <cit> . another possibility is that each mx-cre fmip flox/flox mouse has a slightly different strain background, suggesting that in some cases, a graft-versus-host reaction may occur.

all bone marrow cell recipient mice showed extramedullary hematopoiesis in spleen, but no significant pathological change was observed in other organs. these data suggest that thoc5/fmip is required in bone marrow for hematopoiesis, however thoc5/fmip is less important in other organs, such as liver and heart.

deletion of thoc5/fmip results in markedly decreased thoc1
we have recently shown that the c-terminal domain of thoc5/fmip forms a complex with thoc <dig> and the n-terminal domain binds to thoc <dig> directly  <cit> . furthermore, the binding of thoc <dig> to thoc5/fmip requires the nuclear localization of thoc <dig>  these facts raise the question as to whether loss of thoc5/fmip molecule influences stability of another member of the complex. since thoc5/fmip expression was drastically down-regulated in the livers, we analyzed the expression of the members of the tho complex in liver tissue before and after poly  injection. fourteen days after poly  injection, there was more than an 80% decrease of thoc5/fmip observed at the protein level. although aly, and thoc <dig> were unchanged, the amount of thoc <dig> went down to 30% within  <dig> days . a reduced level of thoc <dig> was also observed in thoc5/fmip depleted bone marrow cells . furthermore, a broad band with molecular mass of  <dig> kda was detected from poly  treated liver and bone marrow cell extract by thoc <dig> specific immunoblot analysis , suggesting that thoc <dig> protein may not be stable in the absence of thoc5/fmip. to examine whether thoc <dig> decreases at the mrna level, we performed rt-pcr in these organs. using thoc5/fmip specific primers  <dig> bp product was obtained from untreated liver mrna, while a  <dig> bp product was obtained from poly  treated liver mrna . the difference in size corresponds to the exon iv/v deletion in treated animals. the mrna levels of thoc <dig> and aly were unchanged by treatment with poly . to confirm these data without poly  effect, we utilized mouse embryo fibroblasts  isolated from thoc5/fmip  mice. after infection with adenovirus carrying gfp and cre-recombinase, thoc5/fmip was drastically reduced within four days. in agreement with data obtained from liver tissue, the level of thoc <dig> protein was also drastically reduced . as control we infected adenovirus carrying gfp alone. we did not observe a reduction of thoc5/fmip or thoc <dig> in control virus infected mef. these data suggest that depletion of thoc5/fmip causes down regulation of thoc <dig> also in cell culture system.

our data indicate that tho complex plays a key role in early embryogenesis and the tho complex in bone marrow is essential for hematopoiesis, however it is less important in differentiated cell types such as hepatocytes and heart muscles.

discussion
we have previously shown that depletion of thoc5/fmip by sirna or ectopic expression causes abnormal hematopoiesis and abnormal adipocyte differentiation in myloid progenitor or mesenchymal progenitor cell lines  <cit> . furthermore, although tho complex does not play a role in nuclear export of bulk mrna, thoc <dig> deletion causes embryonic lethality  <cit> . this led us to investigate the potential roles for thoc5/fmip in vivo. to do this we first generated conventional knockout mice, deleting thoc5/fmip. these mice died at an early embryonic stage. furthermore, although heterozygotic thoc5/fmip deletion mutant mice were fertile and did not display any phenotypic or histological abnormalities after birth, 50% of thoc5/fmip heterozygotes died during embryogenesis , suggesting that the level of expression of thoc5/fmip plays a key role in embryo development.

when an inducible system was developed a key developmental system, hematopoiesis, was found to be sensitive to depletion of thoc5/fmip. our data showed that bone marrow cells and spleen cells, but no other organs, such as liver, heart, kidney, intestine, testicle, or lung, became apoptotic in thoc5/fmip deficient adult mice, suggesting hematopoietic required thoc5/fmip. in addition, transplantation with bone marrow cells derived from cre minus thoc5/fmip mice rescues poly  injected mx-cre thoc5/fmip mice from death. this extends back to the primitive cells in the hematopoietic system, since thoc5/fmip depleted mice showed a major decrease in progenitor cells  and also a fall in the slowly cycling bone marrow lsk cells . the effects of an rna processing protein on stem cells were also profound and this we argue in part explains the massive effect on the committed progenitor cell compartment compared to lsk cells. nonetheless, the rapid onset of the effect also argues that the progenitor cell compartment is sensitive to loss of fmip/thoc <dig> expression.

mx-cre directed depletion by poly i:c injection was observed in bone marrow cells, heart, kidney, liver and spleen  <cit> . indeed, thoc5/fmip specific pcr analyses using genomic dna as a template revealed that exons iv/v were deleted from these organs, including spleen after only one × times poly  injection. we did not observe the depletion of thoc5/fmip protein in spleen for any time period however, the size of spleen is drastically reduced after seven days poly  injection, suggesting that apoptotic cells are released from spleen and that the thoc5/fmip protein half life in certain cells was longer than in other cells.

the issue remains how and why thoc5/fmip is required for primitive hematopoietic as well as embryo stem cell survival and/or proliferation. our data suggest that the tho complex is required for mrna export of particular genes that play a key role in hematopoietic primitive  and committed progenitor cell survival and/or proliferation. alternatively, the tho complex may be essential for bulk poly + rna export in primitive cells. the yeast trex complex is composed of the tho transcription elongation complex , tho <dig> , mht <dig> and thp2), tex <dig> , sub <dig>  and yra <dig>   <cit> . yeast trex mutants show a nuclear export defect for bulk poly a+ rnas and are synthetically lethal with many mutants of the mrna machinery  <cit> . in drosophila loss of the tho complex function results in only minor differences in transcription profiles as revealed by the whole genome array  <cit> . the analysis of the cytoplasmic mrna from bone marrow cells was not successful, because cytoplasmic mrna from bone marrow cells was not stable enough for microarray analysis. therefore, we analyzed the expression level of cytoplasmic mrna in fibroblasts. in the presence or absence of thoc5/fmip, we found that less than  <dig> genes were down-regulated more than three-fold using the mouse whole genome array . in the fibroblast system, however, the depletion of thoc5/fmip did not cause apoptosis, but reduced cell growth , suggesting that thoc5/fmip has a specific function in proliferating cells. it has been shown recently that in response to treatment of mice with interferon-alpha hematopoietic stem cells efficiently exit g <dig> and enter an active cell cycle  <cit> , suggesting that poly  treatment may exacerbate the phenotype which is observed in thoc5/fmip deletion mice. further studies will be required to examine whether the mice would present the same phenotype if other methods of conditional deletion of thoc5/fmip in the relevant cell types were used.

we show here that the thoc5/fmip binding partner, thoc <dig> was down-regulated via thoc5/fmip knockdown. furthermore, we have shown that the expression of mutant thoc5/fmip lacking the thoc <dig> binding site degraded faster than the wild-type and down-regulated the level of endogenous thoc <dig>  <cit> , suggesting that these two molecules may stabilize each other forming a functional unit. it indicates that the phenotype we observed might be the result of both thoc <dig> and thoc5/fmip depletion. it has been shown that over-expression of thoc <dig> causes apoptosis in several cells  <cit> . the deletion of thoc <dig> also causes apoptosis in cancer cells, but not in normal fibroblasts  <cit> . furthermore, the embryonic development of conventional thoc <dig> knockout mice is arrested around the time of implantation  <cit> . interestingly, thoc <dig> possesses the death domain and interacts with rb protein, suggesting that thoc <dig> may involve the apoptosis signal directly  <cit> .

our analysis demonstrates a link between thoc5/fmip protein function and the normal developmental processes seen in adult hematopoiesis. we now have a suitable model system to determine how tho complex proteins act, enabling primitive cell survival and proliferation.

CONCLUSIONS
thoc5/fms interacting protein is an essential element in the maintenance of hematopoiesis. furthermore, mechanistically depletion of thoc5/fms interacting protein causes the down-regulation of its direct interacting partner, thoc <dig> which may contribute to altered tho complex function and cell death.
