BACKGROUND
tuberculosis continues to be a leading cause of human mortality and morbidity, with who figures estimating a global prevalence exceeding  <dig> million and mortality of approximately  <dig>  million in the year  <dig>  <cit> . the continuing global crisis has become further complicated by the emergence of multi-drug resistant strains of the bacteria and an increasing population of hiv-infected patients around the world. in view of this escalating clinical challenge, there is a growing need to develop novel therapeutic alternatives employing potent mycobactericidal mechanisms. hence, there has been a lot of interest in cell autophagy as a potential immune defense mechanism against a number of bacterial pathogens, including mycobacteria  <cit> . physiological or pharmacological induction of autophagy via cell starvation or treatment with rapamycin, have been reported to suppress mycobacterial survival within raw cells through increased acidification and maturation of mycobacterial phagosomes  <cit> .

it has been previously reported from our laboratory that treatment of infected human macrophages with adenosine 5'-triphosphate  was capable of killing mycobacteria by subverting the mycobacterium-induced block in phago-lysosomal fusion  <cit> . in the light of recent findings, the present study was undertaken to look for evidence of induction of cell autophagy within atp-treated macrophages and of a role for this process in mediating its associated mycobactericidal activity. in this work we demonstrate, for the first time, that atp induces autophagy in human macrophages within  <dig> minutes of exposure, which was associated with a subsequent decrease in mycobacterium bovis bcg viability within infected cells. we further confirmed a role for extracellular ca2+ and delineated the identity of the purinergic receptor involved in this process by using ca2+-free media and selective purinergic receptor agonists and antagonists. we were thus able to confirm that atp induces rapid cell autophagy and killing of intracellular mycobacteria within infected human macrophages via a ca2+-dependent process mediated by activation of p2x <dig> receptors. the results support the importance of autophagy as a mycobactericidal mechanism utilized by human macrophages and provide a possible rationale for the recently reported p2x <dig> polymorphisms associated with extra-pulmonary tb  <cit> . the findings also suggest a potential therapeutic role for p2x <dig> agonists in treating mycobacterial infections.

RESULTS
atp induces autophagy
to determine whether atp was capable of inducing autophagy in thp <dig> cells and monocyte-derived macrophages , the expression of the microtubule-associated  and membrane associated  forms of lc <dig> protein were assessed in both atp-treated and untreated cells by western blot and confocal microscopy.

the processing of the  <dig> kda microtubule-associated form of lc <dig> protein  to its  <dig> kda, truncated form , is accepted as one of the standard read-outs of cell autophagy  <cit> . in western blot studies, we observed expression of both lc3-i and lc3-ii forms of lc <dig> protein in atp-treated thp <dig> cells  and mdms,  as revealed by bands with electrophoretic mobility corresponding to molecular masses of  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda respectively. in contrast, only the  <dig> kda lc3-i band was expressed in control non-atp treated thp <dig> or mdm cells .

another commonly used assay for monitoring for the occurrence of cell autophagy relies on demonstrating by microscopy the transitional shift of the  <dig> kda cytosolic  form of lc <dig>  to its membrane-associated,  <dig> kda lipidated form, lc3-ii on autophagosomes  <cit> . using an anti-lc <dig> antibody, we observed, by confocal microscopy, an increased transition of the diffuse cytosolic staining pattern, typical of lc3-i,  to the punctuate staining pattern, characteristic of lc3-ii, within atp-treated mdms .

atp-induced autophagy is dependent on mobilization of extracellular calcium
we have previously reported that atp can stimulate ca2+ entry into cells not only through activation of ionotropic p2x purinoceptors, but also via mobilisation of intracellular ca2+ into the cytosol by activation of metabotropic p2y receptors  <cit> . we then sought to establish the relative contribution of these ca2+ sources to the induction of autophagy by examining the cellular response to atp  stimulation for  <dig> minutes in both ca2+-containing and ca2+-free medium. in cells treated with atp in ca2+-containing media we observed the induction of autophagy by western blot analysis as revealed by the expression of both the  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda forms of lc <dig> protein . in contrast, atp-induced cell autophagy was shown to be completely inhibited in ca2+-free medium, as revealed by the absence of expression of the  <dig> kda lipidated form of lc <dig>  .

atp-induced autophagy is p2x <dig> â€“ dependent
having obtained preliminary evidence of p2x receptor involvement in atp-induced cell autophagy from the above results, we sought evidence that this process involved p2x <dig> receptors. we then investigated the induction/inhibition of autophagy in response to a number of purinergic receptor agonists and antagonists. it was observed in western blot assays  that autophagy  was not induced following uridine 5'-triphosphate   stimulation, which activates p2y, but not p2x receptors. in contrast, autophagy was induced by the atp analogue, benzoylbenzoic atp , which selectively activates p2x <dig> receptors. to further confirm the role of the latter receptor, we pre-treated thp <dig> and mdm cells with either adenosine 5'- triphosphate periodate oxidized atp ; an irreversible antagonist of p2x <dig>  or an anti-p2x <dig> blocking antibody, before treating with atp. autophagy was completely blocked in the presence of either inhibitor, as demonstrated by the absence of lc3-ii expression in western blot gels , thereby confirming that atp-induced autophagy is mediated via activation of p2x <dig> receptors.

atp induced phago-lysosomal fusion in infected macrophages is autophagy- dependent
we have previously reported that atp stimulation of p2x <dig> promotes acidification of bcg-containing phagosomes within infected human macrophages  <cit> . moreover, it has also been reported that induction of autophagy in raw cells by starvation or treatment with rapamycin was associated with acidification and maturation of mycobacterial phagosomes  <cit> . in view of these findings, we analyzed the role of autophagy in atp-mediated phago-lysosomal fusion within mdms infected with green fluorescent protein expressing m. bovis bcg . lysosomal trafficking was monitored by preloading bcg-infected cells for  <dig> hour with the acidotropic fluorescent dye lysotracker red that accumulates within acidic organelles  <cit> . the cells were then stimulated with atp  for  <dig> minutes. while control non-atp treated cells showed minimal co-localisation of gfp-bcg with lysotracker red labeled lysosomes , there was significantly greater co-localisation within atp-treated cells   . the results confirmed our previously reported findings on the ability of atp to induce phago-lysosomal fusion within bcg-infected mdms  <cit> . we next examined whether pharmacological inhibitors of autophagy could block this effect. we observed that wortmannin, a classical phospatidylinositol- <dig> kinase  inhibitor, which has previously been reported to inhibit the early stages of autophagosome formation  <cit> , dramatically reduced the levels of co-localisation of bcg-containing phagosomes with lysosomes   . the results support the involvement of cell autophagy in atp-induced, phagolysosome fusion and acidification of mycobacteria-containing phagosomes. pre-treatment of mdms with an anti-p2x <dig> neutralising antibody also resulted in a significant reduction in the levels of co-localisation   .

localization of mycobacteria in autophagosomes
electron microscopic analysis of atp-treated mdms revealed the presence of multiple, large cytosolic autophagic vacuoles within both non-infected and bcg-infected cells , while such vacuoles were almost absent in non- atp-treated, infected cells . in addition within atp-treated infected cells, em analysis revealed the presence of bacilli within characteristic double-membrane autophagosomes containing partially degraded internal membranes typical of maturing autophagosomes   <cit> .

atp-induced autophagy mediates rapid mycobacterial killing
we have previously reported that atp induces rapid killing of intracellular mycobacteria via a cell-mediated process, as atp had no direct bactericidal effect on bcg  <cit> . to examine the role of autophagy in this process, bcg-infected mdms were pre-treated with wortmannin for  <dig> hr prior to pulsing with atp  for  <dig> minutes and the viability of the intracellular mycobacteria assessed at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hours post-treatment by 3h-uridinine incorporation assay . atp was shown to result in a marked reduction in intracellular bcg viability at  <dig> hr ,  <dig> hr  and  <dig> hrs post treatment  as compared to that obtained in non-atp-treated, infected cells, confirming previous reported findings  <cit> . however, pre-incubation of infected mdms with wortmannin for  <dig> hr prior to exposure to atp resulted in marked inhibition of this bactericidal effect with intracellular bcg viability at  <dig> hrs ,  <dig> hrs  and  <dig> hrs  remaining significantly higher than in equivalent atp-treated cells at each time point . to confirm that atp was acting through p2x <dig> to induce cell autophagy, and subsequent bacterial death, infected mdms were pre-treated with the p2x <dig> receptor antagonist, oatp, for  <dig> hours prior to exposure to atp. pre-treatment of cells with oatp was shown to result in almost the complete inhibition of atp-induced mycobactericidal activity with intracellular bcg viability at both  <dig> hrs  and  <dig> hrs  post-treatment remaining similar to that obtained in non-treated cells, confirming that atp acts via p2x <dig>  in total the results suggest that atp-induced mycobactericidal activity involves p2x <dig> activation and the subsequent induction of cell autophagy.

discussion
in this study we have shown that atp-treated, bcg-infected thp- <dig> cells and mdms undergo rapid cell autophagy, which involves the activation of p2x <dig> receptors and mobilization of extracellular calcium. electron microscopy of atp-treated, bcg-infected mdms, revealed the presence of the bacteria within characteristic double-membraned autophagosomes. in addition, atp-induced cell autophagy was accompanied by rapid phago-lysosomal fusion and loss of mycobacterial viability within infected cells suggesting that autophagy contributes to this mycobactericidal process.

autophagy has recently been highlighted as an innate immune defense mechanism against bacterial pathogens such as group a streptococcus, shigella and mycobacterium tuberculosis  <cit> . bacterial agents like listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus have also been reported to evade host immunity by subverting autophagy, thereby underscoring its importance as a potent mycobactericidal mechanism  <cit> . earlier studies in rat hepatocytes had shown an association between reduction in the volume density of autophagic vacuoles and a fall in intracellular atp levels  <cit> . in this study we sought to obtain more direct confirmation that extracellular atp could induce autophagy in human macrophages. we demonstrated that lc <dig> lipidation and lc3-ii association with autophagosomal membranes, which are both commonly used read-outs of autophagy  <cit> , were induced by atp, as revealed by immunoblotting and the transition of lc <dig> from its diffuse cytosolic appearance to a punctate intracellular distribution .

exploring the identity of the purinergic receptor involved in the process, we observed that atp-induced autophagy was mediated via activation of p2x <dig>  as revealed by the use of specific agonists and antagonists of this receptor. autophagy was not induced in the absence of extracellular calcium , which was consistent with the known property of p2x <dig> to promote influx of extracellular calcium into the cytosol in contrast to p2y, which mobilize intracellular calcium.

the highly polymorphic structure of p2x <dig> has recently been described and five polymorphisms have been described that lead to reduction or loss of p2x <dig> function  <cit> . it has recently been shown that p2x <dig> polymorphisms were associated with impaired atp-induced mycobacterial killing  <cit>  and increased susceptibility to extra-pulmonary tb  <cit> . the present study is the first to report on the involvement of p2x <dig> in inducing cell autophagy and provides a possible rationale for the impaired mycobactericidal activity and increased predilection for extra-pulmonary tb associated with certain polymorphic forms of p2x <dig> 

our laboratory and others have previously reported that elevation of cytosolic calcium levels in atp-treated, bcg-infected macrophages is linked to increased phago-lysosomal fusion  <cit> . since induction of autophagy was dependent on mobilization of extracellular calcium, we explored its effect on maturation of mycobacterial phagosomes. induction of autophagy by atp coincided with increased acidification of mycobacterial phagosomes, which was reversed on pre-treatment of mdms with wortmannin. in atp-treated cells, the bacteria were found to localize within characteristic double-membraned autophagosomes. a difference in appearance and positioning of both lysostraker red labeled vesicles and gfp-bcg within wortmannin treated cells was observed as compared to anti-p2x <dig> and non-treated macrophages . this was attributed to the previously reported effect of wortmannin to induce swelling of late endosomal compartments associated with pi3-k inhibition involved in membrane trafficking between late endosomes and lysosomes  <cit> . we further observed that addition of atp had a bactericidal effect on bcg, which was reversed partially by wortmannin and almost completely by oatp . these findings are consistent with recent observations by gutierrez et al who demonstrated that induction of autophagy, by starvation or rapamycin, in macrophages infected with m. tuberculosis , leads to maturation of mycobacteria-containing phagosomes into phagolysosomes and suppression of mycobacterial viability  <cit> . hence, induction of autophagy with atp, as with the classical inducers like starvation or rapamycin, can override the mycobacterial block on phagosomal maturation. this ability of autophagy to induce phago-lysosomal fusion and subsequent bactericidal activity could have potential therapeutic implications. in view of the involvement of p2x <dig> receptors in this phenomenon, the development of selective, potent and safe p2x <dig> agonists as therapeutic alternatives in the treatment of multi drug resistant -tb should be explored.

the bactericidal effect of atp on bcg or mtb in human and bovine mdms has been reported previously by our laboratory and other groups  <cit> , though the mechanism of such action has not been clearly elucidated. it has been recently shown that mtb infection of macrophages leads to intracellular accumulation and extracellular release of atp, which in turn activates p2x <dig> receptors to mediate cellular apoptosis and bacterial killing  <cit> . apoptosis was induced in this latter study in  <dig>  Â±  <dig> % of macrophages in response to stimulation with  <dig> mm atp at an moi of 10: <dig>  following  <dig> hours of infection  <cit> . however, the evidence for atp-induced apoptosis is still equivocal, as we have found that caspase inhibitors do not block atp-mediated killing of intracellular mycobacteria although they do block il-1Î² release  <cit> . moreover, in contrast to atp, classical inducers of cell apoptosis such as fasl or anti-fas antibody are relatively ineffective at reducing intracellular bcg viability within infected human macrophages  <cit> . in addition, using a lower dose of atp , a lower moi  and a lower duration of culture, we failed to observe any difference in apoptosis levels between atp-treated and control cells, as revealed by flow cytometric determination of active caspase- <dig> expression . though it is probable that macrophage apoptosis plays a role in atp-mediated mycobacterial killing, the rapid decline in intracellular bcg viability immediately after atp exposure appears to be primarily mediated by autophagy. this is consistent with our observation that wortmannin, a classical inhibitor of autophagy, achieved only partial reversal of bactericidal activity while the p2x7-antagonist, oatp, almost completely inhibited atp-induced bacterial killing . similarly, in our confocal studies neither anti-p2x <dig> or wortmannin treatment completely ablated the co-localisation observed following atp stimulation , implying that other mechanisms are involved in mediating this effect. the results suggest that atp-induced mycobactericidal activity is dependent on both autophagy as well as apoptosis. the use of a more specific p2x <dig> inhibitor such as kn <dig> or combinations of inhibitors such as anti-p2x <dig> and wortmannin, which may exhibit synergistic activity may help to clarify the relative roles of each process. that autophagy is involved in atp-mediated mycobactericidal activity is supported by previous reports describing profound changes in the architecture of the intracellular vacuolar system of atp-treated infected macrophages . however, these changes were also accompanied by membrane blebbing and nuclear condensation , which are morphological changes associated with early stages of apoptosis supporting a role for both processes in the associated mycobactericidal effect. multiple, large cytosolic vacuoles were also formed within non-bcg infected cells following atp treatment . although no detailed assessment was made of their structure in terms of whether they represented autophagosome formation, it was noted that cellular debris was apparent in a high percentage of them. our laboratory is currently undertaking a detailed assessment of such structures to determine the degree of autophagosome formation within atp-treated macrophages.

that autophagy may prove a critical mycobactericidal effector mechanism utilized by phagocytes is also suggested by the fact that we have previously reported, using macrophages derived from p47phox-/- and inos-/- mice, that neither oxygen or nitrogen radical generation are involved in mediating atp-induced, mycobactericidal activity  <cit> . moreover, parallel studies performed in bcg-infected macrophages, derived from both nramp resistant and susceptible strains of mice, also failed to reveal any influence of this additional macrophage-associated, anti-bacterial mechanism on the mycobactericidal effects of atp  <cit> . thus many of the classical, cell-mediated, antibacterial effector mechanisms of oxygen and nitrogen radical generation, or nramp protein expression do not appear to be involved in, and hence as effective as induction of autophagy in the atp-mediated killing of intracellular mycobacteria.

work is currently underway in our laboratory to further analyze the relative roles played by autophagy and apoptosis and their inter-dependence in the mycobactericidal activity mediated by atp.

CONCLUSIONS
we report that exposure to atp induces human monocytes/macrophages to undergo rapid cell autophagy, through a p2x7-dependent mechanism. induction of autophagy is associated with augmented mycobactericidal activity of macrophages, which is mediated through increased phago-lysosomal fusion of mycobacterial phagosomes. these results support the importance of autophagy as an innate, cellular, mycobactericidal mechanism and highlight a potential therapeutic role for p2x <dig> agonists in the treatment of mdr-tb.
