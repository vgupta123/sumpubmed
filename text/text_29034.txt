BACKGROUND
whole-genome duplication  has played a major role in eukaryotic evolution
. in particular, flowering plants have experienced repeated episodes of polyploidy since they shared a common ancestor with the gymnosperms some  <dig> million years ago
 <cit> . understanding the genomic consequences of polyploidization, particularly when accompanied by hybridization , allows insight into the potential for speciation and adaptation of these novel entities
 <cit> . in particular, the merger and doubling of two divergent genomes can induce different genetic and epigenetic changes in the resulting polyploid
. genetic modifications can include gene loss, genome down-sizing, variable mutation rates of the duplicated genes , chromosomal rearrangements and regulatory incompatibilities resulting from post-transcriptional modifications in the merged genomes
. epigenetic modifications involve heritable changes in gene expression without changes in the nucleotide sequence
 and can include histone modification, dna methylation, chromatin remodeling, or microrna or prion activity
. dna methylation, the addition of a methyl group at position  <dig> of the pyrimidine ring of cytosine, is a common mechanism associated with gene silencing in polyploids
. in general, cytosine methylation is important for maintaining genomic stability and is involved in genomic imprinting, transposon silencing and epigenetic regulation of gene transcription
.

here, we investigated gene silencing via methylation in the allotetraploid plant tragopogon miscellus. this species formed repeatedly during the early 1900s in the western united states, following the introduction of the diploid progenitors, t. dubius and t. pratensis, from europe
. previous studies identified extensive homeolog loss
 and chromosomal variation
 <cit>  in naturally occurring t. miscellus populations. two studies
 <cit>  also identified homeologous gene silencing in some individuals of t. miscellus, but the mechanism for silencing was not known. in tate et al.
 <cit> , the t. dubius copy of one locus  was silenced in multiple individuals from pullman, washington, and moscow, idaho. in buggs et al.
 <cit> , six loci showed variable silencing of t. dubius or t. pratensis homeologs in a few individuals from five different populations . in the present study, we used comparative bisulfite sequencing to determine if these loci were silenced by methylation.

RESULTS
cg methylation regulates duplicate gene expression
genomic and bisulfite-converted sequences were acquired for four loci [tdf- <dig> 
 <cit> , s <dig> , s <dig> , and s <dig> 
 <cit> ] from allopolyploid tragopogon miscellus and the diploid parents t. dubius and t. pratensis . a fifth locus  identified as silenced in buggs et al.
 <cit>  was not amenable for study because no single nucleotide polymorphisms  between the diploids were maintained following bisulfite conversion to distinguish the parental copies in the allopolyploid . for the four loci examined, we took advantage of snps between the diploids to determine if a parental homeolog was silenced by methylation in the t. miscellus individuals. in addition to the partial gene sequences retrieved in the two previous studies
 <cit> , 5’ genome walking was undertaken to determine methylation status of the promoter regions. the new sequences were deposited in genbank .table  <dig>

methylation of homeologous loci in
tragopogon miscellus. sequence polymorphisms between the diploid parents  were used to determine homeolog-specific silencing in t. miscellus allopolyploids.  diagrammatic illustration of the expected chromatogram peaks for genomic and bisulfite-converted sequences when un-methylated or methylated in allopolyploid t. miscellus. this example shows silencing of the t. dubius homeolog.  chromatograms of tdf- <dig> indicating the position of a methylated cg adjacent to a polymorphic site  in t. miscellus compared to the diploids.  chromatograms of s <dig> showing an un-methylated cg site in t. miscellus  and the location of a polymorphic site between parental copies . red, blue, green and yellow colors of the chromatogram correspond to a, c, t and g, respectively. iupac ambiguity codes: w = a/t, y = c/t, r = a/g. bs-converted = bisulfite-converted.



inspection of the promoter and coding regions identified cg sites, which are common methylation sites in plants
 <cit> . the integrity of bisulfite conversion was determined from the conversion of all the cs not adjacent to a g into ts. the loci studied here all showed complete bisulfite conversion in the genic regions, while incomplete conversion at a few sites was detected in the promoter region of tdf- <dig> for three polyploid individuals . given that most of the promoter and genic regions were properly converted, the incomplete conversion for tdf- <dig> does not influence the overall interpretation of the results. such low frequency of partial bisulfite conversion is commonly due to reaction temperature
 <cit> . alternatively, these sites could represent varying levels of chh  or chg methylation
 <cit> .

cg methylation of both sense and antisense strands was detected in the genic and promoter regions of s <dig>  and tdf- <dig> . tdf- <dig> included seven cg sites in the promoter region and four in genic regions; the t. dubius homeolog was methylated in  <dig> of  <dig> t. miscellus individuals from pullman and moscow , which reveals the mechanism of silencing observed in tate et al.
 <cit> . the exception was individual 2604- <dig>  which retained only the t. dubius genomic homeolog and therefore expressed that copy
 <cit> . similarly, we found methylation of the s <dig> locus, which was shown by buggs et al.
 <cit>  to be silenced in two t. miscellus individuals . all cg sites in the promoter  and genic  regions of s <dig> were methylated in both individuals. however, both parental homeologs showed cg methylation and sequencing the cloned bisulfite-converted sequences revealed twice as many methylated t. dubius cloned copies as t. pratensis copies. this result suggests that methylation can quantitatively regulate the level of expression of parental copies rather than completely silencing one homeolog. for locus s <dig> , which had  <dig> cg sites in the promoter and  <dig> in the genic regions, the only methylation detected was one individual that showed hemimethylation of the antisense strand . interestingly, this individual only showed methylation at five of the  <dig> cg sites in the genic regions.

analysis of the promoter and genic regions of the other locus  did not show methylation of any of the cg sites . thus, there may be mechanisms other than dna methylation that are responsible for homeolog-specific silencing. for example, histone deacetylation  is thought to be responsible for transcriptional repression
. rna interference  is also widely associated with post-transcriptional silencing via a number of different mechanisms, including mrna degradation, translational inhibition and the repression of transcription elongation
.

natural variation in epigenetic patterning is not well understood, but can be an important driver of ecological speciation, as has been found in viola
 <cit>  and dactylorhiza
 <cit> . here we find differences in the methylation status and silencing mechanisms in allopolyploid individuals from different populations . for the  <dig> tragopogon miscellus polyploids studied here, most showed silencing of only one locus in the previous studies of tate et al.
 <cit>  and buggs et al.
 <cit> , but three individuals showed silencing of two or more loci. some of these loci are silenced by methylation, but others are not, suggesting diverse mechanisms exist within an allopolyploid individual to regulate duplicate gene expression. for the loci that were methylated, two showed 100% cg methylation in genic and promoter regions , while the third was methylated at 50% of the genic cg sites. as methylation of gene regions is not usually associated with gene silencing in plants
 <cit> , how this pattern of methylation contributes to silencing this gene, if at all, is not understood. comparison of the methylation status of silenced vs. unsilenced loci could lend further insight into the role of gene body methylation in tragopogon.

hence, as in other polyploid species [spartina anglica,
 <cit> , brassica,
 <cit> , wheat,
 <cit> , rice,
 <cit> , arabidopsis suecica,
 <cit> ], genome evolution in tragopogon miscellus includes dna methylation as a mechanism to regulate duplicate gene expression, which we demonstrate here for the first time. previous studies in tragopogon showed homeolog loss
 and chromosomal repatterning
 <cit>  following allopolyploid formation. these latter phenomena seem to be more common mechanisms in t. miscellus populations than expression changes for dealing with the ‘genome shock’ that accompanies hybridization and whole genome duplication
 <cit> . the loci silenced via methylation had the t. dubius copy silenced, which, although a small number, may indicate a ‘preference’ for silencing loci of one progenitor’s genome. this result is true of the t. miscellus polyploids formed with either t. dubius  or t. pratensis  as the maternal parent, so there does not seem to be a maternal ‘imprinting’ influence for the loci studied here. this interpretation is in line with previous studies that have reported a greater tendency of homeolog loss of the t. dubius copy compared to t. pratensis
. curiously, in the case of rdna, although t. dubius homeologs are more frequently lost from the polyploid genomes, transcription rates of remaining t. dubius copies are higher than t. pratensis copies
 <cit> . as t. miscellus has shown a high frequency of homeolog loss, but little gene silencing based on the studies to date
, a more comprehensive genome-wide analysis of methylation would help to determine the role of this epigenetic mechanism in shaping the evolution of tragopogon allopolyploid genomes.

CONCLUSIONS
allopolyploids can employ diverse mechanisms to cope with duplicate and redundant genomes. while previous studies of tragopogon allopolyploids showed that homeolog loss is a common consequence of allopoyploidization, here we show that dna methylation can silence one progenitor homeolog or it can regulate the level of expression of the two progenitor homeologs. as further genomic resources for tragopogon are developed, genome-wide methylation analyses should be undertaken to assess how extensive homeolog methylation is within the allopolyploid species.
