BACKGROUND
clades will typically retain their ecological characteristics, at least over moderate periods of evolutionary time  <cit> , and where inherited climatic tolerances are narrow, this will limit species' geographic range expansion. as long as the inherited component of ecological preference is strong, species evolving in allopatry should initially have similar habitat requirements, and ecological differences between them should accumulate gradually  <cit> . these arguments set up expectations about how climate niches and species ranges in groups of related species should correlate with each other. phylogeographic analyses of several african plant clades have found strong signal of neogene habitat fragmentation and opportunity for allopatric speciation  <cit> , but provided no quantitative data on ecological requirements of the species involved. davis et al.  <cit>  in their study of  <dig> species of the malpighiaceae genus acridocarpus showed that aridification in eastern africa apparently was accompanied by a small radiation, possibly involving niche shifts, but did not have details on species' drought tolerances. for a clade of tropical african annonaceae, couvreur et al.  <cit>  inferred divergence events between east and west african rainforest species during the pliocene and miocen, but provided no data on niche shifts. a likely reason for the comparative neglect of tropical african plant groups in eco-evolutionary studies is that ranges are poorly known because the underlying occurrence data are too incomplete  <cit> . related problems are a lack of monographic studies, poorly understood species boundaries, and few species-level phylogenies, the precondition for identifying sister species.

while african plant clades are thus underrepresented in eco-phylogenetic studies, the immense interest in primate evolution in africa has resulted in a wealth of data on vegetation and climate history  <cit> . during the middle miocene, starting from about  <dig> ma onwards, the african continent underwent gradual cooling and uplift in the east and south, leading to an expansion of woodlands and savannas, and reducing the ranges of lowland rain forest species  <cit> . by the upper miocene,  <dig> ma ago, rifting and volcanism blocked precipitation, amplifying the overall aridification in east africa  <cit> . the early pliocene brought slightly warmer climates until c.  <dig>  ma  <cit> , when the african tropics began experiencing dramatic climate changes that lasted throughout the pleistocene and holocene  <cit> . during the driest and coolest periods of the pleistocene , rain forests may have been restricted to refugia from which they re-expanded during more favorable periods  <cit> . the quaternary climate oscillations affected all of equatorial africa  <cit> , with the most recent catastrophic destruction of rain forest occurring  <dig> years ago  <cit> .

here we investigate clade diversification and changes in species' precipitation niches in the african cucurbit genus coccinia. coccinia comprises  <dig> species  and is almost confined to sub-saharan africa where it diversified into numerous habitat types. the only species that "escaped" from sub-saharan africa is c. grandis, which spread to the highlands of the arabian peninsula and tropical asia, and is now an invasive weed on the pacific islands and in the neotropics  <cit> . pollination of coccinia is by bees , including honeybees. the numerous habitat types occupied by its  <dig> species make coccinia a suitable system in which to study niche evolution among close relatives. the niche parameters we focus on are annual precipitation and number of arid months, with species' tolerances being inferred from the occurrences of  <dig> geo-referenced collections. likely past changes in species' ecological preferences were inferred from a time-calibrated molecular tree including all but two of the species. we expected that close relatives would have similar climatic niche envelopes , although clearly there had to have been at least two shifts since different coccinia species occur in semi-arid habitats, woodland, and forest, vegetation types with contrasting precipitation regimes.

RESULTS
phylogenetic reconstruction and divergence time estimates
the concatenated plastid dna alignment comprised  <dig> nucleotides from  <dig> accessions representing  <dig> of the  <dig> species of coccinia. table  <dig> lists all dna sources with their geographic origin, species name and author, and genbank accession numbers. a maximum likelihood tree  obtained from the plastid data  shows four major groups: a quinqueloba group that occurs in southern africa, a barteri clade that mostly occurs in central and west african rain forest, an adoensis clade that is widespread, but absent from central and west african rain forest, and a rehmannii clade that occurs from ethiopia via east africa to southern africa.

the nuclear lfy 2nd intron alignment  comprised  <dig> characters for  <dig> accessions, representing  <dig> species of coccinia plus three outgroups. a maximum likelihood tree from these data  does not contradict the plastid tree topology except for a few accessions in the c. adoensis and c. barteri clades discussed below, and an accession of c. sessilifolia, which in the nuclear tree groups with the quinqueloba group, but in the plastid tree groups with the adoensis clade.

a tree from the nuclear its alignment is almost unresolved , but its sequences helped pinpoint suspected hybridization . for example, individuals of c. adoensis from different parts of the species' range have different its sequences.

a chronogram from a slightly reduced plastid dna data set  shows the inferred absolute ages  for nodes with > <dig>  posterior probability. the diversification of coccinia apparently began  <dig>  ma ago , with most of the extant species diversity dating to the pliocene.

climatic tolerances and biome preferences among close relatives
differences in climatic tolerances for species in well-supported clades were quantified by pair-wise mann-whitney u tests, focusing on annual precipitation and number of arid months . after each species or unit  had been assigned to one of three habitat categories , maximum likelihood inference of habitat shifts on the phylogeny and the mann-whitney u tests revealed at least six habitat changes , counting only changes in statistically supported sister species or clades. differentiation of precipitation preferences within habitat category  was not counted as a biome shift.

fields above the em dash  line are comparisons of the number of arid months, below are comparisons of the annual precipitation. one asterisk  indicates significance at the 5% level, two asterisks  indicate significance at the  <dig> % level. bold numbers indicate statistically significant differentiation between species .

we next tested whether the number of pairs of species that have the same niche preferences differs from that obtained if species habitat distributions were drawn at random . among the  <dig> nodes in the phylogeny,  <dig> involved habitat shifts , which is significantly fewer than the expected number of  <dig> . even when the four most basal nodes are deleted from the analysis owing to the ambiguity of their character states, the phylogeny still includes significantly fewer habitat shifts than expected at random . thus, occupation of one of our three habitat categories appears to be a statistically conservative trait in the sense that daughter lineages tend to retain habitat type more frequently than expected by chance, given that the random probabilities are estimated from the current distributions of species. the next sections briefly describe the geography and timing of the inferred six shifts between semi-arid habitats, woodland, and forest.

the coccinia quinqueloba group comprises four species and began diversifying c.  <dig> ma  ago. its divergence times and habitat preferences are shown in figure  <dig>  geographic ranges in figure 5b, and precipitation tolerances in figure  <dig>  the species in this group occur in two habitat categories , and there was at least one niche shift in terms of the tolerated precipitation regime. the three forest species  diverged around  <dig>  ma  ago, during the late pliocene to pleistocene.

the coccinia barteri clade includes eight central and west african species plus the east african  c. mildbraedii ; figure 5a shows the species' geographic ranges  and figure  <dig> their climatic tolerances. diversification of this clade began  <dig> ma  ago, that is, at the beginning of the early pliocene warming. most of the species occur in lowland rain forests or mountain forests at elevations up to  <dig> m, although c. barteri and c. heterophylla also have been collected in humid semi-deciduous forests and clearings. coccinia spec. nov. represents a biome shift from rain forest to semi-humid savanna . coccinia barteri is morphologically diverse, and based on herbarium material, species boundaries in the barteri clade tend to be cryptic .

the coccinia adoensis clade comprises nine species and includes at least two biome shifts . the first involves the sister species c. grandiflora and c. schliebenii, which occur in  forests of east africa , while their widespread relative c. adoensis occurs in mountain grasslands, deciduous woodlands, and rarely in moister bushlands  from south africa to ethiopia and to nigeria. the deeper split is dated to the late pleistocene , while c. grandiflora/c. schliebenii separated from each other c.  <dig>  ma ago . the second biome shift involves c. ogadensis and c. grandis, which are adapted to semi-arid conditions .

the coccinia rehmannii clade, which started diversifying during an arid period at the end of the miocene  <dig>  ma  ago , comprises five species  and two biome switches . the split between c. abyssinica and c. megarrhiza dates to c.  <dig>  ma ago, at the end of the warm and humid early pliocene, and that of c. rehmannii from c. microphylla and c. trilobata to c.  <dig>  ma, during the humid late pliocene. the climate tolerances of the five species are shown in figure  <dig> 

evidence for hybridization
one of the incongruities between the nuclear and plastid dna tree topologies concerns c. racemiflora from rain forests of west equatorial africa. in the plastid tree , c. racemiflora  <dig> and c. racemiflora  <dig> group together and share a  <dig> bp deletion in trnsgcu-trngucc intergenic spacer. morphologically, these two plants appear to represent the same species. however, in the nuclear lfy tree , c. racemiflora  <dig> groups with c. barteri  <dig> while c. racemiflora  <dig> groups with c. barteri  <dig>  the latter plant is morphologically intermediate between c. barteri and c. racemiflora and may present a hybrid.

two other incongruities concern c. adoensis . first, in the plastid tree , c. adoensis accessions from east africa cluster with the east african c. grandiflora and c. schliebenii, while pubescent c. adoensis accessions  <dig> and  <dig> from south africa  cluster with a glabrous c. adoensis  <dig> from southern zambia. in the nuclear lfy tree , c. adoensis  <dig>  which in the plastid tree clustered with east african plants, instead groups with c. adoensis  <dig> . the its alignment  reveals that single individuals of c. adoensis can have two kinds of sequences: c. adoensis  <dig> from zambia  harbors sequences matching c. adoensis  <dig> from south africa as well as sequences matching c. adoensis  <dig> from namibia. second, in the plastid tree, east african c. adoensis are distant from c. aurantiaca, while in the nuclear tree they are in a polytomy with c. aurantiaca and c. adoensis  <dig> 

discussion
at the outset of this study, we expected minimally two biome shifts, this being the number required to explain the presence of coccinia in semi-arid habitats, woodland, and forest. instead, we found six statistically significant biome shifts among close relatives . however, this is still fewer than if the habitats were distributed on the phylogeny at random. the onset of coccinia diversification dates to just  <dig>  ma ago, a time when the warm and humid climate began to become cooler and drier. climatic conditions then continued to oscillate during the pliocene and quaternary . additionally, the east african rifting led to aridification and more open grasslands starting at  <dig> -  <dig> ma ago  <cit> ,  <cit> . depending on species' ecological tolerances, these climate fluctuations must have caused range reduction and fragmentation, or expansion and merging. the likely ancestral precipitation preferences of the coccinia clade remain unresolved ; the sister genus, diplocyclos, which comprises four species, is restricted to rain forest and semi-deciduous woodlands  <cit> .

the  <dig> forest species of coccinia all have discontinuous distributional ranges, as exemplified by c. grandiflora , fitting with forest expansion during pleistocene interglacials that likely reconnected most forest refugia  <cit> . survival in persisting refugia probably explains the populations of c. subsessiliflora in the southern sudanese imatong mts. , of c. barteri in the mountain region between zimbabwe and mozambique, and of c. mildbraedii in the eastern arc mts. for c. heterophylla, which occurs in the angola escarpment at 15°30's , mist-saturated local vegetation pockets  <cit>  may have offered survival possibilities during dry periods, while the presence of c. mildbraedii in the kenyan highlands , may result from introduction by humans . it nevertheless shows that central african species would probably find suitable habitats in east africa if forest expansion advanced further.

the coccinia barteri clade is interesting in containing two rain forest species  with overlapping distributions  and co-occurrence in the same habitats . they likely descend from a widespread ancestral species, the range of which became fragmented during the cool/dry mid-pliocene, with c. longicarpa becoming restricted to southwestern ghana and c. keayana to liberia, fitting with maley's  <cit>  refugia. today, c. longicarpa is also distributed east of the dahomey gap , an abrupt climatically induced rain forest disjunction in west africa. although forest fragmentation during glacial periods likely was severe, present range disruptions in central and west africa seem to date only to the recent holocene  <cit> . recurrent fragmentation and reconnection of populations during the pleistocene apparently led to hybridization and introgression, which would explain the high morphological and genetic variability in c. barteri .

among the few species of coccinia that appear to have originated during and since the pleistocene are the forest species c. grandiflora/c. schliebenii from east africa and c. quinqueloba/c. mackenii  from south africa. each pair comprises morphologically similar species with partly overlapping ranges . the stronger aridity in east and southern africa compared to central and west africa seems to have led to pleistocene allopatric speciation in these aridity intolerant species. that the range of c. schliebenii extends into ethiopia and the didinga mts. in southeastern sudan , which have similar amounts of precipitation, probably reflects long-distance seed dispersal by birds  <cit> , rather than remnant populations from a once continuous range. this is because intervening forests, such as those of the usambara mts. and mt. kenya, have been well collected, yet have not yielded c. schliebenii.

coccinia species of the rehmannii clade and other dry-adapted species occur on either side of the miombo belt , but are absent from the belt itself . the reason does not appear to be the belt's poor lateritic soils  <cit>  since coccinia species can grow on such soils , and so are c. grandis  and c. sessilifolia . fire is an unlikely explanation too, since coccinia species have tubers and can re-sprout. during the pleistocene, the miombo belt apparently was crossable for ostriches and antelopes  <cit> , making its barrier role for coccinia even more difficult to understand.

CONCLUSIONS
the at least six biome shifts among the  <dig> species of coccinia analyzed here may be an underestimate because of our assignments of species into just three broad biome types, semi-arid habitats, woodland, and forest. a fuller understanding of the physiological traits behind tolerated precipitation regimes in coccinia would require transplants or common garden experiments  <cit> . the present results, based on occurrence data and ecological information from herbarium specimen labels, however show that changes in ecological tolerances  have played an important role in the diversification of coccinia. a strength of this study is that it is based on consistent species concepts and geo-referenced data for well over  <dig> collections.
