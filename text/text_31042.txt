BACKGROUND
macrophages play a pivotal role in regulating the initiation, amplification, and resolution of innate immune responses. several diseases including atherosclerosis, diabetes, cancer, and rheumatoid arthritis are associated with a defect or alteration in macrophage function  <cit> . these cells arise in the bone marrow from granulocyte/macrophage progenitors, which are the precursors of monocytes. monocytes exit the bone marrow and in turn respond to cytokines and chemokines during their recruitment into tissue where they differentiate into resident macrophages. macrophages can be classically activated  or alternatively activated  based upon the response of these cells to the extracellular milieu  <cit> . in the presence of ifn-γ and pamps such as lps, macrophages become m <dig> activated while in the presence of th2-type cytokines such as il- <dig> and il- <dig>  macrophages undergo alternative activation or are skewed toward an m <dig> phenotype  <cit> . macrophage polarization dramatically alters the immune properties of these cells as evidenced by the potent anti-microbial properties of m <dig> macrophages versus the prominent tissue repair properties of m <dig> macrophages  <cit> . although m <dig> and m <dig> markers have been more thoroughly characterized in mouse macrophages  <cit> , human macrophages show selective soluble and cell membrane associated marker expression following exposure of these cells to m <dig> or m <dig> skewing conditions  <cit> . examples of chemokines/chemokines receptor markers that are selectively upregulated under m <dig> conditions include ccr <dig> and ccl <dig> whereas ccl <dig> is selectively upregulated under m <dig> conditions in human macrophages  <cit> . mannose receptor is a selective m <dig> marker in both mouse  <cit>  and human  <cit>  macrophages.

il- <dig>  similar to il-1β and il- <dig>  is a member the il- <dig> family that has a major role in innate immune responses driven through its receptor st <dig>  <cit> . il- <dig> is constitutively expressed by endothelial and epithelial cells and is found associated with chromatin in the nucleus  <cit> . il- <dig> is released by these cells following necrotic cell death, hence this cytokine has been referred to as an 'alarmin'  <cit> . several experimental models have shown that binding of recombinant il- <dig> to st <dig> leads to the induction of th <dig> immune responses  <cit> , but its effects on a number of non-adaptive immune cells have been well documented  <cit> . specifically, a recent study addressed the effects of il- <dig> on mouse macrophages and showed that this cytokine amplifies the expression of m <dig> markers in these cells  <cit> . less is known about the immunomodulatory effects of il- <dig> in human cells but this cytokine is known to enhance both th <dig> and th <dig> responses in human basophils, th <dig> cells, inkt cells, nk cells, mast cells, and eosinophils  <cit> . however, little is known about the effect of il- <dig> on primary human macrophages.

herein, we investigated whether human bone marrow-derived macrophages express st <dig> and respond to il- <dig>  and whether the activation status of human macrophages alters the response by these cells to this cytokine. these studies showed that human macrophages express both the transmembrane form of st <dig>  and the soluble form of st <dig> . characterization of the effect of il- <dig> on human macrophage activation suggested that it promoted m <dig> chemokine generation in naïve human macrophages but enhanced the expression of m <dig> chemokine markers in previously polarized macrophages, regardless of the prior polarization signals. together, these data suggest that il- <dig> has a direct effect on the expression of m <dig> and m <dig> chemokine markers in human macrophages.

methods
culture of human bone marrow-derived macrophages
an institutional review board  at the university of michigan medical school approved the studies described below . informed consent was not required for irb approval of this study because bone marrow was collected at the university of michigan medical center from patients undergoing various diagnostic tests and mononuclear cells and only the unused portions of these bone marrow samples were studied.

each bone marrow sample was first subjected to a density gradient centrifugation over ficoll-paque™ plus  to isolate cells of myeloid origin. in order to establish a reproducible protocol for growing macrophages from human bone marrow, we tested several types of culture conditions, media, and growth factor combinations. the protocol that yielded both the greatest number and purity of macrophages is described herein. briefly, bone marrow cells were plated onto  <dig> mm tissue culture dishes and  <dig> ml of iscove's modified dulbecco's medium  supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum ,  <dig> u/ml of penicillin,  <dig> μg/ml of streptomycin, β-mercaptoethanol,  <dig> ng/ml of macrophage colony stimulating factor ,  <dig>  ng/ml of granulocyte monocyte colony stimulating factor ,  <dig> ng/ml of stem cell factor , and  <dig> ng/ml of il- <dig> was added. all cytokine growth factors were purchased from r&d systems . cells received  <dig> ml of fresh imdm containing cytokine growth factors at day  <dig> after plating and cultured for a total of 7- <dig> days at 37°c in 10% co <dig> 

prior to an experiment, spent media was removed from the cultured macrophages, the plate was washed with ca+ <dig> and mg+ <dig> free pbs to remove non-adherent cells, and the macrophage monolayer was incubated in ca+ <dig> and mg+ <dig> free pbs for  <dig> min on ice. next, macrophages were dislodged via repetitive pipetting. the resultant cell suspension was centrifuged at 400-× g for  <dig> min. the cell pellet was suspended in imdm containing fcs,  <dig> u/ml of penicillin,  <dig> μg/ml of streptomycin, and β-mercaptoethanol and plated at a density of  <dig> × 106/ml in triplicate wells of a 6-well tissue culture plate.

flow cytometry of human macrophages
bone marrow-derived human macrophages were washed once with buffer containing  <dig> % bsa and  <dig> % nan <dig>  fcr blocking reagent from miltenyi biotec was used to block fc receptors. these cell suspensions were then stained with the one of the following antibodies or antibody combinations: fitc conjugated cd11b , pecy7-conjugated cd <dig> , biotin-conjugated cd <dig>  followed by pecy <dig> conjugated streptavidin , or biotin-conjugated cd <dig>  followed by pecy <dig> conjugated streptavidin . cells were fixed in 4% formalin and analyzed using beckman coulter fc <dig> and flowjo software .

effect of il- <dig> on m <dig> and m <dig> chemokine expression by human macrophages
in the first series of experiments, macrophages were polarized toward either a m <dig> or m <dig> phenotype using distinct stimuli. to skew macrophages toward the generation of m <dig> chemokine markers, triplicate wells  containing  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells were stimulated with  <dig> ng/ml of ifn-γ  combined with  <dig> μg/ml of lps  for  <dig> h. to skew macrophages toward the generation of m <dig> chemokines, triplicate wells containing  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells with the combination of  <dig> ng/ml of il- <dig> and  <dig> ng/ml of il- <dig>  for  <dig> h. in other experiments, macrophages were incubated with  <dig> ng/ml il- <dig>  alone for  <dig> h. to study the effect of il- <dig> on previously polarized macrophages, macrophages were activated in m <dig> or m <dig> conditions for  <dig> h. these cells were washed and exposed to  <dig> ng/ml of il- <dig> alone, il- <dig> in combination with m <dig> or m <dig> macrophage skewing cytokines, or the m <dig> or m <dig> cytokines alone for an additional  <dig> h in culture. in all experiments, cell-free supernatants were removed and individual wells were processed for immunocytochemistry, protein analysis by western blotting, or quantitative rna analysis.

immunocytochemistry and western blotting analysis of st2
macrophages were either fixed in 8-well labtek tissue culture slides for immunocytochemistry or treated with protein lysis buffer in 6-well tissue culture plates prior to western blotting analysis. employing a standard immunocytochemistry technique, an anti-st <dig> polyclonal antibody from prosci  was used to stain for st <dig> in primary human macrophages exposed to media alone, il- <dig>  m1-polarizing mediators, or m2-polarizing mediators. igg control groups were also included in this protocol. standard western blotting techniques were used to detect st2l and sst <dig> in cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts from cultured naïve and m2-polarized macrophages.

quantitative rt-pcr
to analyze gene expression, rna was extracted from adherent human macrophages using trizol . rna was then converted to cdna using murine moloney leukemia virus reverse transcriptase . the resulting cdna was analyzed by real time q-pcr using the abiprism  <dig> detection system . premixed primer/probe reagents for ccr <dig> and ccl <dig> were purchased from applied biosystems. the primers used to detect mannose receptor were acc tca caa gta tcc aca cca tc and ctt tcatca cca cac aat cct c. the primers used for the detection of ccl <dig> were tac ctc ctg gca gat tcc ac and tta gaa gag gtg gcc tcc ag. the following forward and reverse primers were used for the detection of st2:  cag gaa aga aat cgt gtg t,  gcc aag aac tga ctg cct. to further distinguish the soluble form of st <dig>  from the membrane associated form of this receptor  the following primers were used. soluble st2:  agg ctt ttc tct tgt ttc cag taa tcg g;  cag tga cac aga ggg agt tca taa agt tag a. st2l:  agg ctt ttc tct tgt ttc cag taa tcg g;  ggc ctc aat cca gaa cat ttt tag gat gat aac. a sybr green pcr mix was used to amplify st <dig>  st2l, sst <dig>  mannose receptor, ccl <dig>  the expression of gapdh was used as internal control for each pcr reaction.

statistical analysis
analysis of variance  and the dunnett's test were used to detect statistical differences between control and polarized human macrophages with and without il- <dig> treatment. p values of ≤  <dig>  were considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
m <dig> and m <dig> chemokine marker expression by human bone marrow-derived macrophages
flow cytometric analysis of human bone marrow-derived macrophages revealed that the culture techniques employed promoted the expression of cd11b, cd <dig>  and cd <dig> on approximately 90% of these cells . cd <dig> was also expressed by approximately 40% of the cultured macrophages. cultures of human macrophages were skewed toward a m <dig> phenotype upon exposure to ifn-γ and lps for  <dig> h . this was apparent by the elevated transcript levels of the m <dig> markers ccr <dig> and ccl <dig> in these cells . the fold-increase in ccl <dig> transcript levels in m <dig> macrophages reached statistical significance compared with untreated or control macrophages . conversely, transcripts for two human m <dig> markers ccl <dig> and mannose receptor  <cit> , but not the m <dig> markers ccr <dig> or ccl <dig>  <cit> , were significantly elevated under m <dig> conditions compared with control macrophages . thus, with the appropriate external stimuli, human macrophages appeared to predominately express either m <dig> or m <dig> chemokine markers.

st <dig> expression by human macrophages exposed to either m <dig> or m <dig> conditions
transcript and protein expression of st <dig> was next determined in naïve, m1- and m2-polarized human macrophages. quantitative pcr revealed that st <dig> was constitutively expressed by macrophages but the exposure of these cells either to m <dig>  or m <dig>  conditions markedly increased the expression of st <dig>  further quantitative pcr analysis revealed that the increase in st <dig> expression was restricted to the membrane form of this receptor, namely st2l and increases in soluble st <dig> transcript levels were not apparent with either m <dig> or m <dig> conditions .

immunocytochemical and western blotting analysis of st2l and sst <dig> protein expression in human macrophages are summarized in figure  <dig>  st2l protein was present in naïve macrophages , and in cultures of human macrophages exposed to il- <dig> alone , and when cultured in m <dig> conditions  and m <dig> conditions . because the intensity of st2l staining appeared to be greatest in m2-treated macrophages, western blotting analysis was completed to compare expression in these macrophages with naïve or control macrophages. as shown in figure 3i &3j, both st2l and sst <dig> were increased in expression in m <dig> macrophages compared with the control  group. together these data showed that st <dig> protein was present in human macrophages exposed to either m <dig> or m <dig> conditions, suggesting that both types of macrophages might be responsive to exogenous il- <dig> 

exogenous il- <dig> blocked lps-mediated induction of a m <dig> but not an m <dig> chemokine marker expression in human macrophages
st <dig> has been shown to sequester myd <dig>  away from tlr <dig> thereby blunting lps-induced activation of mouse macrophages  <cit> . to address whether st <dig> activation similarly altered lps responses in human macrophages, we next examined whether the addition of il- <dig> to naïve human macrophages modulated lps activation in these cells. ccl <dig>  and ccl <dig>  were selected as the prototypic m <dig> and m <dig> chemokine markers, respectively. il- <dig> failed to markedly modulate il-1β-, il-6-, pam3cys-, or polyi:c-induced expression of ccl <dig> but it completely blocked the lps-induced expression of this chemokine . conversely, the addition of il- <dig> to naïve macrophages did not block the ability of lps to drive the transcript expression of ccl <dig> . thus, the inhibitory effect of il- <dig> on lps activation appeared to be restricted to a m <dig> but not a m <dig> chemokine marker in naïve human macrophages.

effect of il- <dig> on macrophage m <dig> and m <dig> chemokine expression
because il- <dig> had a differential effect on the expression of m <dig> and m <dig> chemokine markers in naïve macrophages, additional experiments were undertaken to explore this novel modulatory effects of il- <dig> on human macrophages. as shown in figure 5a, the addition of il- <dig> alone to naïve macrophages significantly decreased the transcript expression of ccl <dig>  while it significantly enhanced the transcript levels of ccl <dig> compared with transcript levels of these chemokines in untreated, naïve macrophages. when il- <dig> was added with m <dig> polarizing mediators to macrophages, the transcript expression in these cells was dramatically shifted toward ccl <dig> expression; transcript levels of this chemokine were significantly increased approximately 30-fold above the m <dig> condition alone  . the addition of il- <dig> to the m <dig> condition only modestly increased ccl <dig> transcript levels in these cultures. the addition of il- <dig> with m <dig> polarizing mediators to human macrophages did not appear to skew these cells appreciably toward either ccl <dig> or ccl <dig> transcript expression since both chemokines were similarly increased above the m <dig> condition alone approximately 2- <dig> fold . thus, the addition of il- <dig> to naïve macrophages favored the expression of an m1-associated chemokine marker over an m2-associated chemokine marker, but its addition to human macrophages cultured in m <dig> conditions promoted the expression of the m <dig> marker ccl <dig> 

effect of il- <dig> on human macrophages previously exposed to either m <dig> or m <dig> conditions
to investigate the effect of il- <dig> on human macrophages following their exposure for  <dig> h to either m <dig> or m <dig> polarizing conditions, il- <dig> alone, il- <dig> with m <dig> or m <dig> polarizing mediators, or m <dig> or m <dig> polarizing mediators alone were added for an additional  <dig> h to primary human macrophage cultures. as shown in figure 6a, the addition of il- <dig> alone macrophages exposed to m <dig> mediators did not induce the expression of ccr <dig> to the same magnitude as that observed in m <dig> polarized cultures exposed to m <dig> mediators with il- <dig> or m <dig> mediators. similar results were observed with ccl <dig> transcript expression although il- <dig> alone did not induce ccl <dig> transcript expression in m <dig> polarized human macrophages . however, the presence of il- <dig> with m <dig> polarizing mediators significantly increased the expression of the m <dig> marker ccl <dig> in macrophages compared with m <dig> macrophages alone . in cultures of m <dig> polarized macrophages, transcript levels of ccl <dig> were markedly induced after the secondary addition of il- <dig> alone or il- <dig> with m <dig> mediators for an additional  <dig> h . interestingly, the secondary addition of m <dig> mediators did not further enhance ccl <dig> expression in m <dig> polarized macrophages . the effect of il- <dig> on mannose receptor transcript expression was also examined and similar results were observed; the secondary addition of the combination of il- <dig> and m <dig> mediators further enhanced mannose receptor expression on m <dig> polarized macrophages. overall, these data suggest that il- <dig> appears to promote m <dig> chemokine expression in polarized macrophages since it promoted ccl <dig> in m <dig> human macrophages and appears to further enhance the expression of m <dig> markers in m2-polarized macrophages.

discussion
the present study demonstrates that human macrophages express st <dig> and respond to the presence of il- <dig>  the expression of st <dig>  particularly the transmembrane form of this receptor, and to a lesser extent the soluble version of this receptor, was affected by the polarization of human macrophages either toward the expression of either m <dig> or m <dig> chemokine markers. macrophages also showed differential responses to il- <dig>  which appeared to depend on the activation status of these cells. naïve macrophages responded to il- <dig> through the elaboration of m <dig> chemokine markers. conversely, when added to m <dig> or m <dig> polarizing or polarized conditions, this il- <dig> like cytokine promoted the expression of m <dig> chemokine markers in human macrophages. together these findings suggest that there is a dynamic range of human macrophage responses to il- <dig> 

the st <dig> gene encodes for two distinct isoforms: st2l and sst <dig>  st2l is the transmembrane form of st <dig> and is the active il-33-signaling receptor while the soluble form of this receptor is thought to function as a soluble decoy for il- <dig>  both st <dig> isoforms are expressed by a number of innate and adaptive immune cells and their expression is altered by cytokine signals  in both types of immune cells  <cit> . regarding mouse macrophages, both forms of st <dig> have been described in these cells although we have previously observed that st2l levels are higher in alternatively activated or m <dig> mouse macrophages  <cit> . these data are consistent with the observation that exogenous il- <dig> amplifies the polarization of alternatively activated macrophages  <cit> . in the present study, both st2l and sst <dig> transcript and protein expression were examined in human macrophages. both forms of st <dig> were present in naïve human macrophages although sst <dig> was never detected in the cell-free supernatants from these cultures . both m <dig> and m <dig> polarizing mediators promoted the transcript expression of st2l but not sst <dig> whereas the m <dig> polarizing conditions increased protein expression for both forms of st <dig>  these data are consistent with previous mouse macrophage data and highlight that st <dig> expression is prominent on human m <dig> macrophages, but it is also expressed by naïve and m <dig> macrophages as well.

in contrast to earlier findings that functional il- <dig> was a product of caspase- <dig> cleavage  <cit> , it is now established that this cytokine is active without proteolysis and is inactivated by apoptotic caspases  <cit> . full length il- <dig>  is released from necrotic cells  <cit>  or by activated mouse macrophages  <cit>  independent of caspase or calpain activity. a truncated version of il- <dig>  is formed via the activity of caspase  <dig> but it appears to lack the full potency of full length il- <dig>  <cit> . at the time these studies were undertaken, recombinant commercial sources of il- <dig> were limited to il-33112- <dig> thus this was the form of il- <dig> used in cultures of human macrophages. key observations from the present study included the m <dig> skewing effect of recombinant il- <dig> on naïve human macrophages as evidenced by enhanced ccl <dig> expression. the inhibitory effect of il- <dig> on lps-induced ccl <dig> expression was consistent with the documented inhibitory effect of st <dig> activation on tlr <dig> signaling  <cit> . however, il- <dig> had no inhibitory effect on the expression of ccl <dig> by naïve human macrophages, data that was consistent with studies in mouse macrophages indicating that il- <dig> did not inhibit lps activation of these cells  <cit> . thus, the addition of recombinant il- <dig> to naïve human macrophages appeared to skew these cells toward the expression of m <dig> chemokine markers.

when added to macrophage cultures containing polarizing or polarized conditions, it was apparent that il- <dig> had a divergent effect from that observed in cultures of naïve human macrophages. specifically, il- <dig> promoted or amplified m2-associated markers such as ccl <dig> and mannose receptors in these cells. these data are consistent with a previously published study showing that il- <dig> amplifies the polarization of alternatively activated or m <dig> mouse macrophages  <cit>  and contributes to th <dig> responses  <cit> . at present, an explanation of the m <dig> skewing properties of il- <dig> in polarizing or polarized human macrophages is not clear, but further studies will be directed at exploring the role of ccl <dig> in this process. ccl <dig> has no known mouse homolog and it has been described as a potent inducer of alternative activation in human macrophages thereby promoting fibrotic responses in the lung  <cit> . thus, il- <dig> uniquely promoted the expression of m <dig> chemokine markers in macrophages previously exposed to m <dig> or m <dig> conditions.

CONCLUSIONS
this study addressed the effect of il- <dig> on the activation and polarization of primary human macrophages. these findings point to a dual effect of il- <dig> that depends on the activation status of these cells, findings that are consistent with those of smithgall and colleagues  <cit>  who demonstrated that il- <dig> amplified both th <dig> and th <dig> type responses in human immune cells. thus, the present findings highlight the complex immunomodulatory role of this cytokine on human macrophages.
