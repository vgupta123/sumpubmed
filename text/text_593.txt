BACKGROUND
mitochondrial genomes  of bilaterian animals are short, circular dna molecules of 14- <dig> kb in length, typically characterized by the absence of introns and the presence of only short intergenic regions, with the exception of the control region , a non-coding region assumed to contain the elements for the regulation of replication and transcription of the genome  <cit> . to date, about  <dig>  complete metazoan mitochondrial genomes have been sequenced and used in comparative mitogenomics and phylogenetic studies on different taxonomic scales  <cit> .

the mitochondrial gene content is highly conserved across the different bilaterian phyla, with typically  <dig> genes  <cit> . among them,  <dig> genes encode for proteins . the remaining genes encode two ribosomal subunits  and usually  <dig> trnas. however, cases of duplication and loss of trnas have been reported within bilaterians  <cit> . tunicate mitochondrial genomes illustrate such exceptions and typically encode  <dig> trnas, apart from two phallusia species which lack the trna-asp  <cit> , and halocynthia roretzi which encode two trna-phe  <cit> . the two additional trnas present in tunicate mitochondrial genomes when compared to vertebrates are  the trna-gly , which is necessary for the translation due to the derived tunicate mitochondrial genetic code  <cit> , and  the trna-met , whose presence might reduce the conflict between translation initiation -- which requires a trna-met  -- and translation elongation that involves aug codons  <cit> .

the mitochondrial gene order is highly conserved within deuterostomia  <cit> , and particularly in chordate genomes. conversely, mitochondrial gene arrangement shows an important plasticity in some animal phyla, , and especially in tunicates  <cit> . tunicates, or urochordates, are marine deuterostomes characterized by markedly diversified developmental and life history traits, and traditionally encompass three major classes: ascidiacea , thaliacea  and appendicularia . ascidiacea, commonly referred to as ascidians, is the most speciose and widespread group. several ascidian species have been identified as invasive species, such as styela clava and pyura praeputialis  <cit> , and have a strong ecological impact on the invaded marine ecosystems. some species are also widely used as model organisms in evo-devo studies like ciona intestinalis and botryllus schlosseri  <cit> . according to the traditional classification, the class ascidiacea is subdivided into three major orders: phlebobranchia, aplousobranchia, and stolidobranchia. in contrast with this taxonomic view, 18s rrna-based phylogenies have shown that ascidians are in fact paraphyletic  <cit> . according to the 18s rrna phylogenetic framework, aplousobranchia, phlebobranchia, and thaliacea are closely related, whereas stolidobranchia forms a distinct and monophyletic group, which might be close to appendicularia, although the position of the latter is still debated  <cit> .

to date, complete mitochondrial genomes of tunicates are mainly available for a single representative of thaliacea  and five ascidians  <cit> , including four phlebobranchians  and one stolidobranchian . the available mitochondrial data suggest that several unique features characterize mitogenomic evolution in tunicates relative to other chordate phyla. two main peculiarities can be distinguished. the first refers to the highly variable gene order observed within the group, which implies that extensive gene rearrangements have occurred even at low taxonomic levels  <cit> . however, since most available tunicate complete mtdna sequences belong to phylogenetically-related species  according to the 18s rrna reference  <cit> , it is not possible to evaluate whether mitochondrial gene rearrangements characterize the whole order or only the aplousobranchia + phlebobranchia + thaliacea clade. the second specificity is that of an accelerated evolutionary rate of tunicates, as revealed by the long branches of the group in mitogenomic topologies  <cit>  and the associated composition bias  <cit> . however, whether this accelerated substitution rate is restricted to protein coding genes as in snakes  <cit>  or is a more general feature of the whole mtdna of tunicates, has yet to be investigated.

these two peculiar evolutionary features of tunicate mitochondrial genome evolution have hampered their reliable phylogenetic placement within metazoans. analyses of mitochondrial protein-coding genes have almost always systematically placed tunicates outside bilateria  <cit> . this is in sharp contrast with recent nuclear-based phylogenomic studies that identified tunicates as the closest living relatives of vertebrates within chordates  <cit> . only two recent mitogenomic study have found marginal support for chordate monophyly. bourlat et al.  <cit>  grouped cephalochordates with vertebrates according to the traditional euchordata hypothesis using a concatenation of the  <dig> protein coding genes under a site- and time-heterogeneous mixture model in bayesian phylogenetic reconstructions. alternatively, zhong et al.  <cit>  recovered the new chordate phylogeny under the maximum likelihood framework when removing the fastest evolving vertebrates species and when considering only the four most conserved mitochondrial proteins.

here, we sequenced the complete mitochondrial genome of the solitary ascidian herdmania momus , an indo-pacific species that was introduced into the mediterranean sea via the suez canal  <cit> . we describe the structural and compositional features of h. momus mtdna, discuss its evolutionary dynamics with respect to other tunicate and chordate mitochondrial genomes, and provide an updated metazoan phylogeny based on probabilistic analyses of the  <dig> mitochondrial proteins using site- and time-heterogeneous mixture models of amino acid substitutions.

RESULTS
general features of h. momus mtdna
the mitochondrial genome of h. momus  accounts for  <dig>  base pairs  in length which falls within the typical range of other tunicate genomes; the smallest genome being  <dig>  bp long in p. fumigata and the largest one  <dig>  bp in d. nationalis. it presents the typical tunicate gene content with all  <dig> protein-coding genes of the mitochondrial respiratory apparatus, including atp <dig>  which appears so divergent in tunicates that it had been difficult to annotate in the initial assemblies of c. savignyi and h. roretzi  <cit> . it also encodes for the two mitochondrial ribosomal genes, srrna and lrrna, and a total of  <dig> trnas , among which are two distinct trnas for the gly , leu , and ser  codons , which is consistent with the modified mitochondrial genetic code of tunicates. finally, h. momus mtdna contains an additional trna-met , similar to all other tunicate genomes sequenced so far  <cit> .

in contrast to other deuterostome mtdna genomes, all genes are encoded on the same dna strand and thus mitochondrial gene transcription shows only one orientation in h. momus, as in all other tunicate genomes sequenced to date. in chordates, although the majority of genes is co-orientated on one major dna strand , a minimum set of trnas and the nd <dig> gene are encoded from the minor one   <cit> . the genome architecture of h. momus thus provides additional evidence in support of the hypothesis that gene arrangement in only one strand is a shared derived feature of tunicate mtdnas  <cit> .

with regard to genome organization, h. momus mtdna seems substantially less compact than other available tunicate mitochondrial genomes. adjacent genes overlap in four cases: cox <dig> - trna-val , nd4l - trna-leu , atp <dig> - trna-asp  and nd <dig> - trna-trp . the total gene overlap thus appears slightly lower with respect to the average ~ <dig> bp gene overlap of the other tunicate genomes  <cit> . interestingly, there is no protein-protein gene overlap. furthermore, h. momus shows a high percentage of non-coding  sequence .

concerning base composition, the mitochondrial genome of h. momus is at rich with a value of  <dig> %. the overall base frequencies as estimated in the coding strand follow the decreasing order t, g, a and c. t is by far the most abundant nucleotide with  <dig> % in the genome. most tunicate mtdnas present similar compositional at-rich profiles varying from  <dig> % in d. nationalis to  <dig> % in c. intestinalis. the only exception concerns the mitochondrial genomes of species from the genus phallusia, which present more balanced at and gc compositions with  <dig> % and  <dig> % at in p. mammillata and p. fumigata, respectively  <cit> .

protein-coding genes
the predicted protein-coding genes in the mtdna of h. momus present lengths that are overall similar to their orthologues in the other tunicate genomes. nevertheless, h. momus was not predicted to carry any deletion at the c-terminal ends of nd <dig> and nd <dig> genes similar to those reported in h. roretzi  <cit> .

the base composition of protein-coding genes in h. momus was measured as being a+t rich, as is the profile of its entire genome. consequently, the codon usage follows the same pattern, with c-rich codons showing lower frequencies than those that are t- or g- rich. extreme cases are constituted by the cgc codon for arginine, which is never used, and by the uuu codon for phenylalanine and uug codon for leucine, which are the most frequently used. the cgc codon is also never used in the two ciona genomes, whereas it is present in other tunicate genomes  <cit> .

the preferred start and stop codons in h. momus mitochondrial genes are gtg  and tag , respectively. in the other pyuridae , gtg is the preferred start codon too, but taa is the most frequent stop codon . like in other tunicate genomes, incomplete t-starting stop codons are predicted at the end of the three genes coding for nd <dig>  nd <dig> and nd4l. the complete taa stop codon is probably created by polyadenylation.

rrna genes
because of high sequence divergence of tunicate rrna sequences, the boundaries of all tunicate mitochondrial rrna sequenced so far have been inferred from the flanking genes. likewise, the srrna gene in h. momus is estimated at most as  <dig> bp long, thus being slightly shorter than its acidian orthologues which range from  <dig> to  <dig> bp, and about  <dig> bp longer than the srrna of d. nationalis mtdna. on the genome map, it is found located between the trna-ala and trna-glu. the lrrna, on the other hand, appears to be at most  <dig>  bp long, a length similar to that of other tunicates, and is located downstream of trna-tyr and upstream of cytb .

both lengths and locations of the two rrna genes in the h. momus mitochondrial genome provide additional evidence for two unique features of mtdna evolution in tunicates. the first is that tunicates present the shortest mitochondrial rrna genes among chordates, and more generally among deuterostomes, with lengths varying at most from  <dig> to  <dig> bp for the small ribosomal subunit and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  bp for the large ribosomal subunit  <cit> . the corresponding lengths for the srrna and lrrna genes in the other chordate lineages are estimated as higher than  <dig> bp and  <dig>  bp, respectively. the second feature shared by all tunicates concerns the location of the two genes in the mitochondrial genome. in contrast to all other chordates, where the two rrna coding genes are usually adjacent, srrna and lrrna are found rearranged and separated in all available tunicate mtdnas  <cit> . the distance between the two genes in h. momus genome is about  <dig> kb. distances of the same order of magnitude  were also identified in the mtdnas of cnidaria, some protostomia, and some echinodermata  <cit> .

trna genes
the predicted cloverleaf structures for the  <dig> trna genes of the h. momus mitochondrial genome are presented in figure  <dig>  as in h. roretzi, only two trnas are characterized by an unusual structure: trna-ser  and trna-asn. trna-ser  appears to possess an  <dig> bp-long anticodon stem structure. similar long stems  have been reported in ciona ssp., d. nationalis, and h. roretzi trna-ser   <cit> . however, this structure is absent in phallusia trna-ser , which appears to have retained the classical cloverleaf conformation  <cit> . concerning the trna-asn gene, two alternative cloverleaf structures have been inferred, as also previously reported for h. roretzi  <cit> . the structure predicted by trna-scan  is characterized by a two-nucleotide spacer between the dhu and the anti-codon stem as well as a mismatch at the start of the t stem. the alternative conventional cloverleaf structure  appears less stable, in forming a mismatch at the start of the d arm. similar two-nucleotide spacers have also been found in the trna-asn structures of phallusia ssp., h. roretzi, and d. nationalis, but not in ciona ssp  <cit> .

non-coding regions
* including  <dig> bp-long spacers.

considering length distributions,  <dig> of the  <dig> nc regions present lengths over  <dig> bp, with the longest accounting for  <dig> bp and being located between the nd <dig> and trna-tyr genes . three additional nc regions measuring more than  <dig> bp have been identified in h. momus mtdna, involving the disjunction of the following gene pairs: cytb - nd <dig>  nd <dig> - trna-his, and trna-lys - nd <dig>  the remaining nine nc sequences are shorter intergenic spacers, mostly 3- <dig> bp long, distributed homogenously through the genome.

the presence of palindrome sequences was checked by sequence similarity searches and has been detected within  <dig> nc regions, and in particular within the three longest nc regions of the h. momus mitochondrial genome. however, no stem-loop structure similar to that of the control region of vertebrate mt-genomes has been identified in h. momus. further studies are necessary to establish whether these regions are involved in the control of replication and transcription.

sequence similarities searches have finally revealed the occurrence of a duplication event in the nc regions of the h. momus genome, similar to those previously determined in ciona intestinalis and phallusia fumigata mtdnas  <cit> . here, a fragment of  <dig> bp was found duplicated in two different locations of the genome: the first, situated in the non-coding region downstream of the nd <dig> gene and upstream of the gene encoding for the trna-tyr ; while the second involved the non-coding region downstream of the trna-asn  and  <dig> bp of the 5' region of the trna-lys. the estimated distance between the repeated motifs is about  <dig> kb .

gene order
the mtdna of h. momus shows a novel gene arrangement with respect to other tunicates, and is radically different from that of its close relative halocynthia roretzi . surprisingly, only one block containing two consecutive genes is conserved between the two species: the pair trna-trp - trna-ile. when considering only the relative arrangement of protein-coding genes, an additional block appears to be shared by the two members of stolidobranchia, consisting of the three genes cytb - nd <dig> - nd <dig>  in h. roretzi, cytb and nd <dig> are separated by four trna-coding genes, whereas in h. momus the two genes are separated by a long non-coding region of  <dig> bp. likewise, the number of trna genes separating nd <dig> and nd <dig> as well as their identities differ in each genome . conversely, the pair cox2- cytb, previously considered as unique and shared by all other tunicates is absent in h. momus, as well as the pair trna-arg - trna-gln which is conserved in most tunicate genomes <cit> .

thus, the mitochondrial genome organization in h. momus when compared to that of h. roretzi suggests that extensive gene rearrangements occur within stolidobranchia, similar to those observed in phlebobranchia  <cit> . future work should determine whether co-generic species in stolidobranchia also present high variations in gene order, as reported for the genera ciona and phallusia within phlebobranchia  <cit> .

phylogenetic analyses
the mitochondrial genome has been repeatedly used in molecular phylogenetics of animals, principally due to several convenient features, such as its relatively small size, its cellular abundance, and its mostly uniparental mode of inheritance facilitating orthology assignment  <cit> . however, the phylogenetic resolving power of mtdnas is often reduced by pervasive lineage-specific variations of base composition and substitution rate  <cit> . bilaterian evolutionary relationships obtained from previous phylogenetic reconstructions based on mitochondrial genes  <cit>  are in relatively good agreement with the currently accepted view of protostomia phylogeny  <cit> . however, the situation is more complex concerning deuterostomia, mainly because of the recurrent placement of tunicates as sister-group of either the remaining bilateria  <cit>  or the other chordates  <cit> . such placement outside chordates is in direct contradiction to results from recent large-scale phylogenomic studies, which strongly support the clade olfactores, i.e., the grouping of tunicates with craniates  to the exclusion of cephalochordates  <cit> . the sister position of tunicates relative to the remaining bilateria is generally interpreted as a long-branch attraction artifact caused by the peculiarities of tunicate mitogenomic evolution in terms of both lineage-specific evolutionary rate and amino-acid composition  <cit> .

in our mitogenomic dataset, the potential occurrence of compositional biases was explored through a principal component analysis  of amino acid composition of the  <dig> taxa . this statistical analysis shows that tunicates have a markedly heterogeneous amino acid composition that is clearly distinct from most other sampled taxa. moreover, tunicates appear extremely divergent from the other chordate representatives. tunicates and jawed-vertebrates are located at the extreme opposite sides of the graph, with cephalochordates in an intermediate position. there is thus a strong compositional heterogeneity in our amino-acid dataset that might cause phylogenetic artefacts if it is not specifically accounted for in models of sequence evolution.

the maximum likelihood tree obtained on the  <dig> protein-coding genes concatenation using the site- and time-homogeneous mtrev+Γ <dig> model of amino-acid sequence evolution places tunicates as the sister group of the remaining bilateria, as previously reported  <cit> . however, the bootstrap support for such a position is low . this result is presumably the outcome of two types of systematic biases: compositional heterogeneity of the tunicate lineage compared to other chordate and animal phyla  combined with accelerated evolutionary rates  <cit> . ml phylogenetic analyses were also conducted under an empirical site-heterogeneous cat mixture model  <cit>  which has been shown to alleviate long-branch attraction artefacts in the context of animal phylogenomics  <cit> . the ml tree inferred under this model shows a dramatic topological shift in placing tunicates as the sister-group of craniates within monophyletic chordates and deuterostomes, in agreement with phylogenomic studies  <cit> . however, this phylogenetic placement is not statistically supported .

in order to further explore the effect of model misspecification on mitogenomics tree inference, bayesian analyses have been conducted using a range of amino-acid sequence evolution models . there is a clear distinction between the results obtained using site-homogeneous models  on the one side, and variants of the cat+Γ <dig> site-heterogeneous model  <cit>  and the site- and time-heterogeneous cat+bp+Γ <dig> model  <cit> , on the other side. site-homogeneous models moderately support a sister-group relationship between tunicates and xenoturbella , whereas the different cat mixture models support the grouping of tunicates with craniates  with the highest bayesian posterior probabilities obtained using the most complex and better-fitting models . these results exemplify the impact of the model of sequence evolution on mitogenomic inference of phylogeny by showing that the new chordate phylogeny  <cit>  can be corroborated by using a model that accounts for both compositional and evolutionary rate heterogeneities.

pp were obtained from  <dig> independent mcmc runs for all models except cat+bp+Γ <dig> for which  <dig> mcmc were run. the number of trees used to compute pp is indicated.

the bayesian consensus tree obtained under the site- and time-heterogeneous cat+bp+Γ <dig> model is detailed in figure  <dig>  the overall phylogenetic picture is consistent with the common tripartite structure of bilateria phylogeny  <cit> , with protostomia and deuterostomia, and protostomia being further divided into lophotrochozoa and ecdysozoa. strong statistical support is obtained for the monophyly of protostomia , and for both of its two major lineages lophotrochozoa and ecdysozoa . the monophyly of deuterostomia is less strongly supported however , in agreement with recent mitogenomic  <cit>  and phylogenomic results  <cit> . within deuterostomia, echinodermata and hemichordata were both retrieved as firmly monophyletic  and are strongly grouped into ambulacraria, as suggested by early mitogenomic studies  <cit>  and later confirmed by phylogenomics  <cit> . however, the position of xenoturbella within deuterostomia remains unresolved in our analysis  as also found in the latest mitogenomic analysis  <cit> , whereas phylogenomics support its sister-group relationship with ambulacraria into a clade named xenambulacraria  <cit> . strong statistical support is obtained for the respective monophyly of the three chordate groups: cephalochordata , tunicata , and craniata . the monophyly of chordata is strongly supported  for the first time in a mitogenomic study, as is the monophyly of olfactores . these results are fully congruent with the growing body of evidence coming from phylogenomic studies that revealed the unexpected sister-group relationship between tunicates and craniates  <cit> .

although removal of fast-evolving gene and taxa has been found to recover the new chordate phylogeny, such an approach is not successful to solve relationships within tunicata  <cit> . our mitogenomic analysis provided strong evidence for intra-tunicate relationships, with the overall phylogenetic scheme being well resolved despite the high lineage-specific evolutionary rate . the inferred relationships for the group were notably in concordance with nuclear-based phylogenies and morphological data. more precisely, herdmania was unambiguously retrieved in a sister-group relationship with halocynthia , in agreement with the systematic classification that places these two ascidian genera within the stolidobranch family pyuridae  <cit> . firm evidence was similarly obtained for the respective grouping of the congeneric species of ciona and phallusia , and high posterior probability is retrieved for a sister-group relationship of the two genera into phlebobranchia . finally, the thaliacean doliolum is found to branch within ascidians with solid statistical support , favoring the hypothesis of ascidiacea paraphyly  <cit>  as also supported by 18s rrna phylogenies  <cit> .

compared evolutionary rates of rrna- and protein-coding genes
a detailed analysis of lineage-specific evolutionary rate was performed by inferring branch lengths on the bayesian consensus reference phylogeny . the comparison of branch lengths obtained on the protein- and rrna-coding mitochondrial partitions, first demonstrates that tunicates are clearly the fastest evolving species of the metazoan dataset on both partitions . it also shows that the rrna-coding partition evolves on average about three times more slowly than the protein-coding gene partition . however, in contrast to what has been observed in snake mitochondrial genomes  <cit> , there is very good correlation between root-to-tip distances inferred from the two partitions . these results reveal that tunicate mitochondrial genomes have experienced a drastic acceleration of evolutionary rate that affects both protein-coding genes and ribosomal-rna genes. this latter observation seems therefore to exclude the occurrence of adaptive evolution episodes in protein-coding genes, recently reported for snake and agamid lizard mitochondrial genomes  <cit> , as the ultimate cause behind the elevated substitution rates in tunicate mitochondrial genomes. nevertheless, the lineage-specific rate acceleration of tunicates probably explains the difficulties previously encountered in reconstructing their phylogenetic position based on mitogenomic data.

CONCLUSIONS
the complete mitochondrial genome of the ascidian h. momus shares several features with the other tunicate mtdnas so far sequenced:  all genes are encoded on the same strand;  two additional trnas, when compared with vertebrates, are present ;  the gene order is highly rearranged, and differs from all other known tunicates, with the noticeable synteny disruption of the cox2--cytb gene block; and  the evolutionary rate is elevated and involves both protein- and rrna-coding genes. from the phylogenetic viewpoint, the analysis of the concatenated mitochondrial proteins recovers the tunicates + craniates clade within monophyletic chordates, provided that site- and time-heterogeneous mixture models of amino acid replacements are used.
