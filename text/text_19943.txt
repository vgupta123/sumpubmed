BACKGROUND
cyanobacteria are among the oldest life form on earth. these organisms inhabit a broad range of ecological environments from fresh water, soil to diverse open oceanographic areas  <cit> . it is estimated that several cyanobacteria living in the open oceans contribute a significant fraction of earth's primary production  <cit> . these bacteria also play important roles in the global cycling of nitrogen and phosphorus  <cit> . therefore their activities have significant impacts on global environmental changes.

phosphorus is one of the essential elements for all life forms, since it is required for the biosyntheses of nucleotides and phospholipids and for the functional regulation of proteins through phosphorylation. however, inorganic phosphate , the only form of phosphorus that can be directly utilized by cells, is limiting in most ecosystems  <cit> . thus, bacteria have evolved to develop various mechanisms to assimilate different phosphorus-containing compounds available to them. phosphorus assimilation pathways have been relatively well studied in e. coli  <cit> , and b. subtilis  <cit> . for instance, it is generally known that phosphorus assimilation related genes in e. coli are regulated by a two-component system comprising the sensor protein, histidine kinase phor, and the transcription factor phob  <cit> . phor is activated through auto-phosphorylation when the pi level in the environment is low. activated phor then phosphorylates phob, thereby activating the latter. phosphorylated phob can either activate or suppress the transcription of genes involved in phosphorus assimilation, resulting in changes in gene expression pattern that accommodate to the availability and the types of phosphorus-containing compounds present in the environment  <cit> . all the genes whose transcription is regulated by phob in a bacterium are collectively called a pho regulon. the known members of the pho regulon in these relatively well-studied species include genes encoding  the two-component system such as phob and phor in e. coli  <cit>  or phop and phorin b. subtilis  <cit> ,  porins and transporters for transporting phosphorus-containing compounds into the cell, and  metabolic enzymes that are used to break down phosphorus-containing compounds to release pi. in e coli, phob is known to bind to at least two tandem direct repeats  of  <dig> bp with consensus sequence ctgtacta separated by an a/t rich  <dig> bp linker, located  <dig> bp upstream of the - <dig> Ïƒ <dig> binding consensus tan3t/a  <cit> . at least  <dig> operons comprising  <dig> genes in e. coli have been identified to be regulated by phob  <cit> .

the pho regulon in cyanobacteria has only been relatively well studied in synechocystis pcc  <dig>   <cit> . previous studies have shown that a two-component system comprising the sensor kinase sphs  and the response regulator sphr  works in a similar manner to sense the pi level in the environment and to regulate the expression of genes that are directly involved in phosphorus assimilation, forming a pho regulon similar to that in e coli  <cit> . however, only three operons have been identified to be activated by the phosphorylated sphr, including the operons sphx-psts1-c1-a1-b1-b1' and psts2-c2-a2-b <dig>  each of which encodes an abc type high-affinity pi uptake system, and the operon phoa-nuch, where phoa encodes an alkaline phosphatase, and nuca an extracellular nuclease  <cit> . the singleton operon urta that encodes a subunit of urea transporter is repressed under phosphorus limitation by an unknown mechanism  <cit> . sphr activates the transcription of genes by binding to at least three tandem direct repeats  of  <dig> bp, but with a consensus sequence different than that in e. coli, namely, cttaacct, in the promoter regions of these genes  <cit> . it is unknown whether the pho regulon in pcc <dig> includes any other genes in addition to these three operons. furthermore, although sphr is encoded in  <dig> other sequenced cyanobacterial genomes besides pcc <dig>  little is known about which genes in these genomes are regulated by sphr. in this work, we have predicted the pho regulons in  <dig> sequenced cynaobacterial genomes that encode the sphr gene using an efficient phylogenetic footprinting based motif scanning algorithm  <cit> . interestingly, three cyanobacterial genomes, i.e., prochlorococcus marinus ccmp <dig>  and synechococcus sp. cc <dig>  and synechococcus sp. cc <dig>  that do not encode the sphr gene, provide us a rare and highly valuable opportunity to examine the turnover of the cis-regulatory binding sites after their regulators were lost during the course of evolution.

RESULTS
 <dig>  conservation of the dna binding domain of sphr
we have identified orthologues of sphr of pcc <dig>  in  <dig> out of the  <dig> sequenced cyanobacterial genomes using the criterion described in the methods section. interestingly, the genomes of ccmp <dig>  cc <dig> and cc <dig> do not encode the sphr gene. as shown in figure 1a, the dna binding domain of sphr of the  <dig> cyanobacteria is highly conserved, suggesting that the dna binding sites of sphrs in these species are likely to be conserved. in particular, the amino acid residues of phob of e. coli that are in direct contact with the pho boxes  as revealed by the crystal  structure of the phob-dna complex  <cit>  are also highly conserved in the sphr sequences . this may explain why both phob of e. coli and sphr of pcc <dig> bind to  <dig> bp tandem repeats with a  <dig> bp linker  <cit> . we therefore infer that all the sphrs in these cyanobacterial genomes bind to cis-regulatory sites with a similar sequence structure. the phylogenetic relationship among these sphr sequences is shown in figure 1b.

 <dig>  profiles of the sphr binding sites predicted by phylogenetic footprinting
when the phylogenetic footprinting technique is applied to the pooled  <dig> upstream regions  of the operons whose genes are orthologous to those that are regulated by sphr in pcc <dig>  highly conserved two tandem repeats with a linker are identified in  <dig> these sequences by our motif finding program cubic  <cit>  with a cutoff score at p <  <dig> . we assume that these motifs are putative pho boxes, and are shown in table  <dig>  the three known sphr binding sites in pcc <dig> are accurately recovered , suggesting that most of the identified motifs are likely to be true pho boxes. shown in figure 1c is the logo representation of the sequence profile of these putative two tandem pho boxes plus the linker; figure 1d is the logo representation of the sequence profile of the combined putative pho boxes of the two tandem repeats shown in 1c. however, such conserved two tandem repeats are not found for any orthologous genes from cc <dig> mit <dig>  cc <dig> and cc <dig>  suggesting that these genes do not bear pho boxes or their pho boxes differ largely from the conserved ones, which cannot be identified by cubic. interestingly, cubic finds high scoring tandem pho boxes for the pstc-a-b operon in ccmp <dig>  although this genome does not encode the sphr gene, thus they are unlikely to be functional.

 <dig>  genome wide prediction of sphr binding sites in each genome
we have predicted all possible sphr binding sites in each of the  <dig> sequenced genomes by scanning their genome sequences with the two profiles of the pho boxes that we have constructed above , assuming that a sphr binding site consists of three pho boxes with two  <dig> pb linkers. given profiles of multiple co-occurring binding sites, our binding-site scanning algorithm computes a log-odds ratio function lor of the scores  of the candidate sites in a genome. lor is the ratio of the probability of finding a sphr binding site in the intergenic regions divided by the probability of finding a sphr binding sites in randomly chosen coding regions. we use coding regions as control sequence because it is less likely that functional sphr binding sites would occur in coding regions . we have argued that our scoring function captures the essence of true cis-binding sites in a genome so that if the genome contains functional binding sites described by the profiles, its lor will become positive when the score value s increases beyond some threshold; and the larger a lor value is, the higher the confidence for the prediction is  <cit> . in contrast, if a genome only contains similar sequences occurring by chance, then its lor will be around  <dig> or lower independent of the increase of the score value s  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  when s increases beyond a certain value, the lor becomes positive for the  <dig> genomes that encode the sphr gene, and the lor values are generally high, suggesting that these  <dig> genomes contain more high scoring sphr binding sites than one would expect by chance, thus these high scoring sites are likely to be functional. in contrast, the lor for the genomes of ccmp <dig>  cc <dig> and cc <dig>  which do not encode the sphr gene, becomes negative when s increases beyond a certain value, indicating that the putative sphr binding sites found in the intergenic regions of these genomes are likely to occur by chance. therefore they are unlikely to be functional. we argue that the lack of strong signals for possible sphr binding sites in ccmp <dig>  cc <dig> and cc <dig> is unlikely caused the lack of representative pho boxes from these genomes in the profiles used in our scanning algorithm. our profiles do not contain any representative sites from cc <dig> and mit <dig> , yet their lor' are still positive. in contrast, though ccmp <dig> has representative sites in our profiles , its lor is negative. we conclude that our algorithm is not biased towards the genomes from which the profiles are constructed and it is robust enough to uncover true sphr binding sites in closely related cyanobacteria even when no representative site from them is included in the profiles. in addition, the results show that our scanning algorithm can tolerate some level of noise caused by including non-functional sites in the profiles. hence, we conclude that ccmp <dig>  cc <dig> and cc <dig> are unlikely to contain functional sphr binding sites represented by the profiles. on the other hand, we have predicted putative members of the pho regulons in the other  <dig> genomes based on the presence of a putative sphr binding site found in their promoter regions at a statistical significance level of p <  <dig>  . these results are listed in the additional file 1: table 1s-16s. the most interesting observations from these predictions are summarized below.

 <dig>  pho regulon members that are directly involved in phosphorus assimilation process
 <dig>  two-component system sphs/sphr genes
the phosphorus sensor kinase sphs and response regulator sphr genes are predicted to be in the same operon in atcc <dig>  pcc <dig>  pcc <dig>  pcc <dig>  cc <dig>  med <dig>  mit <dig>  natl2a and wh <dig>  but they are clearly split into separate operons in aprime, bprime, bf- <dig>  pcc <dig> and pcc <dig> . in addition, the sphs gene is not encoded in ims101; and the gene in mit <dig> is frame-shifted  <cit> , and therefore is unlikely to be functional. thus, sphs in ims <dig> and mit <dig> may be activated by other regulators as suggested for mit <dig> where multiple regulatory genes are induced by p starvation  <cit> . high scoring tandem pho boxes are found for the singleton operon sphr in ims <dig>  and for the operon crp-sphr-sphs in natl2a , suggesting that these operons are regulated by sphr in their respective genomes. however, the sphs/sphr genes in the other cyanobacterial genomes are unlikely to be regulated by sphr. thus the auto-regulation of the phobr operon found in e. coli is not a general rule.

 <dig> . high affinity abc-type pi pst transporter complex genes
all the  <dig> genomes analyzed in this study encode at least one pst transporter complex. in most of these genomes, the complex is composed of the phosphate binding subunit psts, the transmembrane subunits pstc and psta, and the atp-binding subunit pstb, whose genes form an operon in the form of psts-c-a-b. however, the psts gene is split out to form a singleton operon in ccmp <dig>  cc <dig>  med <dig>  mit <dig>  and mit <dig> . furthermore, in the genomes of atcc <dig>  ims <dig>  pcc <dig>  pcc <dig>  pcc <dig>  pcc <dig>  pcc <dig>  bf- <dig> and wh <dig>  the pst transporter complex includes an additional phosphate binding subunit sphx. the sphx gene in bf- <dig>  pcc <dig> and pcc <dig> forms an operon with the genes of the other subunits of the complex in the form of sphx-psts-c-a-b . interestingly, multiple copies of the sphx gene are found in downstream of one of the two pst operons in pcc <dig> . high scoring tandem pho boxes are found for most operons that encode one or more pst genes , except for those in the genomes cc <dig>  cc <dig>  mit <dig> and wh <dig>  where no pho box is found for the operon pstc-a-b and the psts gene. as mentioned before, pho boxes are found for the pstc-a-b operon in ccmp <dig> through phylogenetic footprinting, but they are unlikely to be functional due to the lack of sphr gene in the genome. the reason why these pho boxes remain after sphr was lost is unknown. on the other hand, while we did not find any tandem pho boxes for the pstc-a-b operon in cc <dig> using phylogenetic footprinting , our scanning algorithm identifies a putative sphr binding site in its promoter region with a score value only marginally above the cutoff . the absence of sphr binding sites for the psts gene and the pstc-a-b operon in cc <dig> and cc <dig> might be due to the missing of the sphr gene in their genomes as discussed below. the lack of sphr binding sites for the pstc-a-b operon and the psts gene in mit <dig> and wh <dig> might be due to the relative abundance of phosphate in their environments as evidenced by the loss of the sphs gene in the mit <dig> genome. in addition, while experiments have shown that the gene cluster sphx-psts1-c1-a1-b1-b1' in pcc <dig> form an operon that is regulated by sphr through the three tandem pho boxes in the upstream of the sphx gene  <cit> , we predicted that sphx and psts1-c1-a1-b1-b1' can form sub-transcriptional units, and a high scoring sphr binding site is found in the upstream intergenic region of the psts <dig> gene. the possible function of this putative sphr binding site warrants further experimental investigation.

 <dig> . phosphonate transporter complex and c-p lyase genes
orthologous genes of the phosphonate transporter complex and the c-p lyase in e. coli are found in the genomes of pcc <dig>  ims <dig> and bprime, suggesting that these species are capable of utilizing phosphonates as a phosphorus source for growth. the importance of phosphonates for the prevalence of ims <dig> in the vast open oceans has recently been experimentally demonstrated  <cit> . although in e. coli, genes encoding the phosphonate transporter system  and those encoding the c-p lyase complex  are located in the same operon in the form of phnc-d-e-f-g-h-i-j-k-l-m-n-o-p and are regulated by phob  <cit> , the phn genes are split into two operons in bprime and pcc <dig>  and the phncde genes are duplicated in ims <dig> . high scoring sphr binding sites are found for the predicted operons phnc-d-e-g-h-i-j-k-l-m in bprime, phnd-c-e-e2-g-h-i-j-k-l-m in ims <dig> and phnc-d-all229-e in pcc <dig>  suggesting that they are likely to be regulated by sphr. these results are consistent with the findings in ims <dig> that when tested, the phnd and phnj genes were activated by a phosphorus-deficient medium  <cit>  in which sphr was presumably activated by an unknown regulator.

 <dig> . phosphatase genes
most of the  <dig> cyanobacterial genomes encode alkaline phosphatase genes, possibly of different families. the phoa family members are found in atcc <dig> , aprime , bprime , med <dig> , mit <dig> , natl2a , pcc <dig> , pcc <dig> , pcc <dig> , pcc <dig> , pcc <dig> , and wh <dig> , mostly as a singleton operon except for aprime, bprime, med <dig>  natl2a, pcc <dig> and wh <dig>  in which the phoa gene is predicted to form an operon with other genes . high scoring sphr binding sites are found in their promoter regions except for cya_ <dig> in aprime, cyb_ <dig> in bprime and pmt9312_ <dig> in mit <dig> . furthermore, high scoring sphr binding sites are found for the phod family members encoded in pcc <dig>  and pcc <dig> , and for other families of alkaline phosphatases encoded in bprime  and aprime  . these results suggest that as in e. coli, alkaline phosphatases in cyanobacteria play an important role in utilizing the pi moiety in various organic compounds, and this process is probably highly regulated by sphr in most species/ecotypes.

 <dig> . extracellular nuclease nuch gene
it has been shown that the phoa-nuch operon in pcc <dig> is activated under p limitation, presumably through binding of phosphorylated sphr to the four tandem pho boxes in its promoter region  <cit> , suggesting that nuch might play a crucial role in the utilization of the pi moiety in the nucleic acids in its environment. however, the nuch gene is not found in the genomes of bf- <dig>  ccmp <dig>  med <dig>  mit <dig>  mit <dig>  natl2a cc <dig>  cc <dig>  wh <dig>  which might reflect the fact that the presence of nucleic acids in their ecological niche is less likely, such as in the oligotrophic open oceans. in the genomes where the nuch gene  is encoded, it is predicted to form a singleton operon except for pcc <dig>  pcc <dig> and bprime. high scoring sphr binding sites are found for the nuch genes in the genomes of attcc <dig> , pcc <dig> , pcc <dig>  and pcc <dig> , suggesting that they are under the regulation of sphr in these species/ecotypes.

 <dig>  putative pho regulon members likely to be involved in phosphorus assimilation related global responses
it is interesting that high scoring sphr binding sites are found for numerous genes that might not be directly involved in the phosphorus assimilation pathway but rather in some other important biological processes, such as photosynthesis, carbon fixation and nitrogen assimilation . we have also predicted that three other classes of genes bear sphr binding sites, namely, transporters/porins, kinases and transcription factors . in addition, high scoring sphr binding sites are found for numerous conserved hypothetical genes across all the cyanobacterial genomes that encode the sphr gene, which are listed in table 1s-16s. their specific functions deserve further experimental characterization.

discussion
 <dig>  degradation of sphr cis-binding sites after sphr was lost
the low lor values of the putative sphr binding sites in the genomes of ccmp <dig>  cc <dig> and cc <dig>  in which no sphr gene is found, indicate that these genomes might not contain functional sphr binding sites. since all the ccmp <dig>  cc <dig> and cc <dig> genomes encode other phosphorus assimilation related genes, such as the pst transporter genes, which are in general regulated by sphr in the other  <dig> cyanobacterial genomes that encode the sphr gene, it is reasonable to assume that the last common ancestor of the cyanobacteria harbored ancient versions of sphr, sphs and other phosphorus assimilation related genes that were regulated by the sphs/sphr system. therefore, we conclude that the sphr and sphs genes in ccmp <dig>  cc <dig> and cc <dig> were lost during the course of evolution. interestingly, ccmp <dig> inhabits a lower layer of the sea water in oligotrophic open oceans  <cit> , and both cc <dig>  <cit>  and cc <dig>  <cit>  were isolated from costal seawater, both of which are known to be relatively rich in pi  <cit> . it is likely that the abundant pi in these niches relieved the selection pressure to retain sphr/sphr genes in these organisms, and have resulted in their complete loss. alternatively, the function of sphr could have been hitchhiked by another regulator, which resulted in its loss in these genomes. in any event, the loss of sphr would have in turn led to the degradation of otherwise conserved pho boxes as it has been shown that the conservation of cis-regulatory binding sites is due to the constant purifying selection exerted from the binding interface of their trans-regulators  <cit> .

 <dig>  phosphorus assimilation pathways and their possible coupling to other biological pathways
our analysis results indicate that cyanobacteria as a group of widely distributed microorganisms can utilize a broad range of phosphorus sources, including free pi, pi-containing organic compounds and c-p bond-containing phosphonates, as the relevant transporters and metabolic enzymes are found in their genomes. however, the distribution of these genes in each genome is quite different, reflecting the unique environment where a specific organism inhabits. the only genes that are ubiquitously encoded in all the  <dig> genomes are those that encode the four subunits of high affinity pi pst uptake system, namely, the psts, pstc, psta and pstb genes, suggesting that pi is probably the most widely available source of phosphorus for cyanobacteria despite its low concentration in some environments. while many genes that are directly involved in the phosphorus assimilation pathway are predicted to be regulated by sphr, some others are not. this is in sharp contrast to their orthologues in e. coli, where all these genes are regulated by phob  <cit> . in addition, the regulatory modes of the phosphorus assimilation genes in cyanobacteria are also highly diversified in terms of the distribution of the predicted sphr binding sites for the orthologous genes, reflecting the heterogeneity and complexity of the environments where they inhabit.

intriguingly, numerous putative new members of the pho regulon are predicted in each of the analyzed genomes containing the sphr gene. many of these appear to not be directly associated with phosphorus assimilation but instead encode proteins that are involved in photosynthesis, carbon fixation, nutrients/solutes transportation, signal transduction , and transcription regulation  . a sphr binding site in the promoter region of these genes might serve as a mechanism of cross-talk between the phosphorus assimilation pathway and the pathways in which they play a direct role. it has in fact been shown that nitrogen fixation in ims <dig> is restricted by phosphorus  <cit> , an indication of coordination between the phosphorus assimilation and the nitrogen fixation. interestingly, we have predicted several nitrogen assimilation genes to be putative members of the pho regulon in several species/ecotypes . in addition, it has been shown that in e. coli  <cit> , b. subtilis  <cit> , med <dig>  <cit>  and mit <dig>  <cit> , p limitation is correlated with up- or down-regulations of both phosphate assimilation related proteins/genes and other proteins/genes. for instance, in e. coli, only  <dig> pho regulon genes have been experimentally shown to be directly involved in phosphorus assimilation, while the number of proteins involved in the global response elicited by p limitation could be much larger as it has been shown previously that at least  <dig> genes are involved in the global response to p limitation in e. coli  <cit> . while some of these  <dig> genes might be under the direct control of phob, the others could be the results of cross-talks between the phosphorus assimilation and other biological pathways. this is probably achieved through a network of signal transduction proteins and transcriptional regulators that are directly or indirectly regulated by phob. such a regulatory network is also likely to exist in cyanobacteria, as it was shown that p limitation results in changes in expression of  <dig> and  <dig> genes in med <dig> and mit <dig>  respectively  <cit> , though only  <dig> and  <dig> of them are predicted to bear putative sphr binding sites, respectively. this suggests that the other genes are probably regulated by other regulators. alternatively, these genes could be regulated by sphr through different binding motifs. in addition, it has been shown that the expression of the urta gene in pcc <dig>   <cit>  and in med <dig>   <cit>  is strongly repressed during phosphorus starvation. however, no sphr binding site has been experimentally identified in pcc <dig>  <cit>  or by our computational study. thus the inhibition of urta by p limitation is likely to be mediated by a different regulator other than sphr.

CONCLUSIONS
different cyanobacterial species/ecotypes encode diverse sets of genes responsible for the utilization of various sources of phosphorus available in their environment. unlike in e. coli, only a portion of cyanobacterial genes that are directly involved in phosphorus assimilation are under the regulation of sphr in some species/ecotypes. in the three genomes, i.e., ccmp <dig>  cc <dig> and cc <dig>  where the sphr gene is missing, the pho boxes have degraded to a level that is indistinguishable from the randomly occurring ones . thus, a regulator seems to play an important role in retaining its binding sites. in addition, we have also shown that the predicted pho regulons in cyanobacteria might include genes known to play important roles in other biological process, such as photosynthesis, carbon fixation, nitrogen assimilation, signal transduction and transcription regulation. these genes might serve as bridging points to couple the phosphorus assimilation pathway to the pathways underlying these biological processes.
