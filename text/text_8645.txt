BACKGROUND
β-1→3-d-glucans occur as a principal component of microbial cell walls or can be secreted from both, non-pathogenic and pathogenic fungi such as s. cerevisae and c. albicans  <cit> . these β-1→3-d-linked glucose polymers are characterized as a fungal pathogen-associated molecular pattern   <cit> . the primary cellular recognition of β-1→3-d-glucans is mediated by several β-1→3-d-glucan receptors on phagocytes  <cit>  and other cells  <cit> . human as well as murine dectin- <dig> has been demonstrated to be the major pattern recognition receptor  for intact yeast and β-1→3-d-glucan-containing particles  on monocytes/macrophages as well as neutrophils and on primary cells  <cit> . in the murine system, binding of zymosan to dectin- <dig> resulted in production of tnfα through toll-like receptor  <dig> and the adaptor protein myd <dig>  <cit> . another water-soluble β-1→3-d-glucan  has been described to activate nfκb and nfil- <dig> in murine cell lines  <cit> . similarly, it has been shown that β-1→3-d-glucans activate nfκb in a human monocyte-like cell line  <cit>  and in human polymorphonuclear neutrophils , in the latter case without secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines   <cit> . one study proposed that the production of the anti-inflammatory il-1ra, but not il- <dig> by human monocytes may be a potentially protective mechanism induced by β-1→3-d-glucan  <cit> . three other investigations have reported that human leukocytes and human vascular endothelial cells produce il- <dig> in response to zymosan  <cit>  or a water-soluble β-1→3-d-glucan  <cit> .

in addition, β-1→3-d-glucans seem to be able to modify the response to pro-inflammatory stimuli or even sepsis. in a murine polymicrobial sepsis model, β-1→3-d-glucan  <cit>  treatment resulted in decreased septic morbidity and mortality mediated via inhibition of nfκb and stimulation of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase  pathway  <cit> . these and other animal studies  <cit>  as well as a clinical trial  <cit>  support a protective role of β-1→3-d-glucan in certain pro-inflammatory conditions. the mechanisms underlying these beneficial effects of β-1→3-d-glucan are only partially resolved, especially in humans. thus, the aim of this study was to elucidate molecular and cellular mechanisms of β-1→3-d-glucans on human leukocytes in pro-inflammatory conditions with special emphasis on the cytokine profile and its transcriptional regulation. for this purpose, peripheral blood mononuclear cells  were exposed to a well-defined β-1→3-d-glucan, i.e. glucan phosphate   <cit> , alone or simultaneously with lps from gram-negative bacteria or the superantigen tsst- <dig> from gram-positive bacteria over  <dig> h. because of the potential effect of β-1→3-d-glucan on cytokine production  <cit> , tnfα, il-1β, il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il-1ra were measured as well as ifnγ, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig> and tgfβ <dig>  correspondingly, four nfκb sites from the tnfα promoter   <cit> , a κ consensus site from the il- <dig> promoter  <cit> , an nfat site from the ifnγ promoter   <cit>  and a consensus nfil- <dig> site from the il- <dig> promoter  <cit>  were examined. because of the anti-inflammatory role of il-1ra, we focused on binding of transcription factors to the il-1ra promoter. an inhibitory element and three positive-acting lps-response elements  in the il-1ra promoter, including nfκb, pu. <dig> and nfil- <dig> sites, have been characterized previously  <cit> . using computational analysis for homology search  <cit> , we looked for new binding motifs in the il-1ra promoter.

RESULTS
binding activities of nfκb, nfil- <dig> and nfat from human pbmc to the tnfα, il- <dig> and ifnγ promoters following an in vitro stimulation  with lps, tsst- <dig>  gp, gp + lps and gp + tsst-1
gp induced band shifts, indicating binding of nfκb as well as of nfil- <dig> to the corresponding dna oligonucleotides . the extent of the band shifts induced by gp was not statistically different when compared to lps or tsst- <dig> . a supershift, conducted for an nfκb consensus site from the il- <dig> promoter, demonstrated a gp-induced predominant binding of nfκb p <dig> and to a lesser degree of p <dig> . accordingly, an immunoblot of nuclear extracts from gp-treated pbmc showed a strong binding of nfκb p <dig> and a weaker reaction of p <dig>  whereas p <dig> was negative . simultaneous co-treatment of pbmc with gp did not change the lps-induced nfκb binding to oligos from the tnfα promoter significantly , but substantially decreased the tsst-1-induced nfκb binding when compared to tsst- <dig> or gp  and thus differed completely from the theoretical value of gp/tsst- <dig> calc. . gp was also able to induce band shifts indicative of binding of particular variants of nfat to an oligo from the ifnγ promoter . an immunoblot for two nfat subunits demonstrated a gp-induced binding of nfatc <dig> and to a lesser degree of nfatc <dig> .

cytokine profile of human pbmc following a  <dig> h in vitro stimulation with lps, tsst- <dig>  gp, gp + lps and gp + tsst-1
because of the gp-induced band shifts to seven sites from the tnfα, il- <dig>  il- <dig> and ifnγ promoters, it could be assumed that gp treatment of human pbmc would lead to production of tnfα, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  ifnγ and other pro-inflammatory mediators. previous studies reported that β-1→3-d-glucans induced only a limited cytokine secretion of human blood cells  <cit> . corroborating and extending these singular findings in terms of examining pro-  as well as anti-  inflammatory cytokines over time  and six additional transcription factor binding sites, our comprehensive analysis revealed the following cytokine profile of human leukocytes in response to a highly purified water soluble β-1→3-d-glucan and in comparison to two pro-inflammatory mediators :

 il-1β
there was no il-1β production detectable following pbmc treatment with  <dig> nor  <dig> μg gp. an insignificant up-regulation of il-1β production for gp + lps was observed in comparison with lps. for gp + tsst- <dig> we found a significant reduction in il-1β from  <dig> h –  <dig> h, for the latter by about 40% when compared to tsst- <dig> or the theoretical value of gp/tsst- <dig> calc. . on the whole, gp mediated a reduction of the tsst-1-induced amount of il-1β by about 50% .

 il-6
gp induced only a small amount of il- <dig> and there was no significant alteration of the lps-induced il- <dig> production by gp. on the contrary, we observed a decreased il- <dig> production for gp + tsst- <dig> when compared to tsst- <dig> or gp/tsst- <dig> calc., especially at  <dig> h by about 40% , .

 il-8
we found that gp induced a substantial il- <dig> production, in comparison with medium control, especially at  <dig> h . a combination of gp and lps resulted in a non-significant increase of il- <dig> production when compared to lps or gp/lps calc. there was no significant alteration in il- <dig> production following gp + tsst- <dig> when compared to tsst- <dig> or gp/tsst- <dig> calc. .

 il-1ra
besides il- <dig>  il-1ra was the only mediator which was produced in significant quantities following gp treatment, especially at  <dig> h . when compared to lps stimulation or gp/lps calc., gp + lps did not alter the kinetic course of the il-1ra production. however, following gp + tsst- <dig> we found a synergistic increase in il-1ra production from  <dig> h to  <dig> h, when compared to tsst- <dig>  or to the theoretical value of gp/tsst- <dig> calc. . over the time course of  <dig> h, gp elevated the tsst-1-induced amount of il-1ra by approximately 200% .

positive correlation between gp-induced il- <dig> and il-1ra productions. following stimulation with gp , we observed a positive correlation between il- <dig> and il-1ra. moreover, we found this correlation to be dose-dependent, since  <dig> μg of gp induced larger amounts of il- <dig> and il-1ra than  <dig> μg gp .

 tnfα
with respect to tnfα production,  <dig> μg of gp yielded minor, statistically not distinguishable amounts, when compared to medium control. gp + lps did not change the tnfα production when compared to lps supplementation or gp/lps calc. when combined with tsst- <dig> or gp/tsst- <dig> calc., gp seemed to exert a synergistic effect on tnfα secretion after  <dig> h , but overall an enhancement of only 10% was observed .

 ifnγ
no ifnγ production was detectable following treatment of pbmc with  <dig> μg gp. there was a minor increase in ifnγ production following gp + lps at  <dig> h, when compared to lps or gp/lps calc., and a slight down-regulation following gp + tsst- <dig> at  <dig> h and  <dig> h, when compared to tsst- <dig> or gp/tsst- <dig> calc. .

 il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  tgfβ1
the production of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig> and tgfβ  <dig> was not induced by gp. there were also no significant differences between medium control, lps, tsst- <dig>  gp, gp + lps, gp/lps calc. and gp + tsst- <dig> or gp/tsst- <dig> calc. over  <dig> h .

role of nfκb, nfil- <dig> and nfat binding in lps-, tsst-1-, gp-, gp + lps- and gp + tsst-1-induced il-1ra expression by human pbmc
because gp induced band shifts to nfκb, nfil- <dig> and nfat sites, but no tnfα, il- <dig> or ifnγ, we hypothesized that the activated transcription factors might bind to sites in the il-1ra promoter. we investigated previoulsy described and newly discovered transcription factor binding sites of the il-1ra promoter  using the program omiga . the lps responsive κb consensus site of lre- <dig>   <cit>  displayed band shifts, but no significant alterations of its binding activity, irrespective of the treatment . a new κb <dig> site  within the lre- <dig>  <cit>  showed increased binding induced by tsst- <dig> , but gp co-treatment up-regulated the lps - and the tsst- <dig> -induced binding in a superadditive synergistic fashion, when compared to medium control as well as to lps, tsst- <dig> or gp or the theoretical values of gp/lps calc. or gp/tsst- <dig> calc. . binding to a new κb consensus site  was significantly elevated for gp + tsst- <dig> . the lps-, tsst-1- and gp + lps-induced binding to the new κb2/ <dig> site  was down-regulated by about 20–35% in comparison with medium control . the nfil- <dig> site  close to lre- <dig>  <cit>  showed an up-regulation of binding for all compounds and combinations vs. medium control, ranging from 25–110% . further, gp + tsst- <dig> induced an increased binding to the nfil- <dig> site in comparison with tsst- <dig>  or gp , . a new binding site for nfatp2/ <dig> was found more distal of the transcription start site, between - <dig> and - <dig>  displaying again a substantial increase of binding for all compounds and combinations, when compared to medium control . in addition, binding to the nfatp2/ <dig> site following both, gp + lps  and gp + tsst- <dig>  was elevated , but only in an additive synergistic manner, i.e. the experimental results were not different from the theoretical values .

gp modulated the tsst-1-induced il-1β/il-1ra ratio towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype
in a simplified approach, il-1β and il-1ra might represent two sides of a coin, i.e. pro- or anti-inflammatory action. therefore, we applied the il-1β/il-1ra ratio as an indicator of the degree of inflammation. both, lps and gp + lps treatments resulted in generating more il-1β than il-1ra at early time points, i.e. up to  <dig> h. comparing lps vs. gp + lps, we did not find substantial alterations over a time course of  <dig> h in the il-1β/il-1ra ratio, only a – non-significant –  <dig> fold higher ratio at  <dig> h. with respect to tsst- <dig> or the theoretical value of gp/tsst- <dig> calc. vs. gp + tsst- <dig>  we observed a pronounced anti-inflammatory action of gp, as demonstrated by an about 10– <dig> fold reduced ratio at  <dig> h and  <dig> h of incubation, i.e. a higher production of il-1ra than of il-1β . a biological relevance of this result was suggested by a decrease of the il- <dig> dependent release of il- <dig> from murine el- <dig> cells following gp + tsst- <dig> when compared to tsst- <dig> or gp/tsst- <dig> calc. .

inhibition of transcription factors led to reduced il-1ra levels
pharmacological inhibitors were used to demonstrate that the transcription factor sites within the il-1ra promoter are relevant for the induction of il-1ra by gp. as expected, an inhibition of nfκb via cape  <cit>  and cya, nfat via cya and nfil- <dig> via chx  <cit>  could not be overruled by gp, leading to a down-regulated binding activity of the transcription factors to the il-1ra sites, and a reduction of il-1ra mrna and il-1ra protein levels . the extent of reduction in nfatp2/ <dig> binding is exemplarily shown in an autoradiogram  and graphically summarized . the results for the nfκb and nfil- <dig> binding sites were similar . because the highest il-1ra amount was found at  <dig> h, mrna was examined following  <dig> h inhibition and  <dig> h of gp. a representative gel demonstrating a decrease in il-1ra mrna after inhibition with cape, cya and chx is displayed in fig. 7b . in addition, corresponding il-1ra protein levels after  <dig> h of gp are shown in fig. 7c . altogether, nfκb inhibition by cape was more pronounced at the binding activity and the transcription, whereas cya and chx mainly led to a decreased il-1ra release.

discussion
animal models of sepsis and myocardial injury suggest that a β-1→3-d-glucan like gp mediates its protective mechanisms, in part, via a rapid shift from nfκb- to pi3k-signaling  <cit> . our study provides novel evidence that downstream of recognition and signaling pro-inflammatory transcription factor binding and cytokine expression of human leukocytes is switched to an anti-inflammatory phenotype by gp.

we confirmed and extended previous results  <cit>  indicating that, in the absence of other stimuli, β-1→3-d-glucans induced binding of nfκb-, nfil-6- and nfat-mers to cytokine promoters. because of the multiple band shifts observed for nfat binding , one could speculate that there is activation of several different nfat isoforms, probably derived from alternative splicing  <cit> . interestingly, the gp-induced transcription factor binding transformed only into a very limited cytokine response, namely il- <dig> and il-1ra . hence, our data are in aggreement with the few reports describing a β-1→3-d-glucan-mediated il- <dig>  <cit>  and il-1ra production  <cit> . in addition, our emsa/supershift and immunoblotting results demonstrated a gp-mediated predominant binding of nfκb p <dig> and to a lesser extent of p <dig> to a κb consensus site of the il- <dig> promoter . results by schulte and colleagues  <cit>  pointed to an induction of il- <dig> transcription depending on activation via an nfκb p65/ <dig> homodimer, rather than via p65/ <dig> heterodimers, which might be the case for the gp-mediated il- <dig> transcription. a gp-mediated il- <dig> transcription based upon a cooperation between transactivated nfκb p <dig> and nfil- <dig>  <cit>  or nfatc <dig> dimer binding to the il-8κb site  <cit>  seems also possible. the il-8κb consensus site exhibits a preferentially p <dig> binding half site and thus differs from the κb half site described for tnfα and il-1β  <cit> , supporting the idea of regulating nfκb binding through combinatorial associations of the subunits and the specific sequence of the decameric κb motif  <cit> . unlike lps or tsst- <dig>  we found that gp did not induce il-1β, but it strongly induced il-1ra, suggesting an immediate anti-inflammatory potential of gp. analysing the il-1ra promoter  <cit> , we discovered four new binding sites : an nfκb <dig> site , an nfκb consensus site , another nfκb2/ <dig> site  and a more distal nfatp2/ <dig> site . our data indicated that gp leads to production of il-1ra primarily via induction of nfatp2/ <dig> and nfil- <dig> dna binding, which might be due to differences in the binding motif or the composition of the activated transcription factors  between the ifnγ, il- <dig> and il-1ra promoter. the differential decrease of nfκb, nfat and nfil- <dig> binding to sites in the il-1ra promoter as well as of il-1ra mrna and protein induced by selective inhibitors prior to gp treatment might suggest that these steps are linked to each other and necessary for induction of il-1ra . regarding cellular sources, both, monocytes as well as neutrophils have been reported to produce il-1ra  <cit> . flow cytometric experiments seemed to confirm that monocytes and neutrophils were able to produce il- <dig> just as il-1ra in response to gp . this gp-induced cytokine profile was substantially more restricted than that of lps or tsst- <dig>  which is likely due to differences in recognition and signaling between lps, tsst- <dig> and gp. recognition of lps is mainly mediated through toll-like receptor  <dig> and subsequent signaling via the nfκb pathway, leading to expression of pro-inflammatory mediators like tnfα  <cit> . a bacterial superantigen like tsst- <dig> acts through binding to mhc-ii molecules and subsequently the t cell receptor, leading to release of mainly ifnγ and tnfα, the latter via both, pi3k and p <dig> mitogen-activated kinase signaling  <cit> . altogether, the induction of the neutrophil-attracting il- <dig> and the anti-inflammatory il-1ra by fungal carbohydrates  may well fit to a benign pamp response, mounting defensive mechanisms against a possible microbial attack.

potentially even more relevant than the specific cytokine panel induced by gp, we found that, in the presence of other stimuli , gp ameliorated their pro-inflammatory immune reactions, similar to the effects in murine models of sepsis and inflammation  <cit> . mainly, gp altered the tsst-1-induced il-1β/il-1ra ratio from a pro- to an anti-inflammatory profile via down-regulation of il-1β and il- <dig>  at the same time there was a synergistic up-regulation of il-1ra. in part, this change may be caused by gp-mediated modulations of the tsst- <dig> induced binding of nfκb, nfil- <dig> and nfat to known and up to now unknown sites within the il- <dig> and il-1ra promoter instead of the tnfα, il-1β, il- <dig> or ifnγ promoter. accordingly, we found that the tsst-1-induced binding of nfκb to sites from the tnfα promoter negatively correlated with the gp-mediated enhancement of the tsst-1-induced il-1ra production . of the four examined nfκb sites from the il-1ra promoter, mostly the tsst-1- and lps-induced binding to the nfκb <dig> and the tsst-1-induced binding to the new nfκb consensus site seemed to be increased by gp. so, while we observed a gp-mediated down-regulation of the lps- and the tsst-1-induced nfκb binding to sites of the tnfα promoter, there was an up-regulation to nfκb <dig> and nfκb consensus sites of the il-1ra promoter. these seemingly contradictory data could be explained by differences in either nfκb subunits or conserved nucleotides  within the decameric nfκb binding motif between the tnfα and the il-1ra promoter , probably leading to differences in binding  <cit> . despite the location of the new nfκb consensus site  in the inhibitory element  of the il-1ra promoter  <cit> , we observed no inhibition. on the other side, we found an inhibitory nfκb2/ <dig> site  towards the end of the inhibitory element, demonstrating down-regulations of the lps- and tsst-1-induced binding, which could not be altered by gp. in our opinion, this site may therefore represent at least a part of the previoulsy described inhibitory element  <cit> . the gp-modulated increase in tsst-1-induced binding to the new nfκb <dig> and nfκb consensus site, the nfil- <dig> site  <cit>  as well as to the novel nfatp2/ <dig> site may explain the synergistic up-regulation of the tsst-1-induced il-1ra production. we think that this gp-modulated activation of transcription was reflected by the decrease of the il-1β/il-1ra ratio following gp + tsst- <dig> . in this context, it has been postulated that in vitro a 100fold excess of il-1ra over il-1β might control the biological effects of il- <dig>  <cit> . since, in fact, the il-1β/il-1ra ratio following gp + tsst- <dig> is partially less than  <dig> , it is not unreasonable to assume that il-1β bioactivity is inactivated in our system. indeed, gp reduced the tsst-1-induced, il-1-dependent il- <dig> production of murine el- <dig> cells .

the weaker modulating effects of gp on the lps-induced immune response observed in this study, may be attributed to delicately balanced differences in signaling pathways between lps and tsst- <dig>  <cit> . tsst- <dig> has been shown to use the pi3k pathway for signaling  <cit>  and this effect may be sustained by gp treatment  <cit> . it has been demonstrated that in septic/lps-adapted leukocytes the pi3k pathway selectively controls sil-1ra but not il-1β production  <cit> . signaling via pi3k has been reported to be involved in the activation of nfat in t cells  <cit> . activation of nfκb can also take place via pi3k  <cit> , which may offer an explanation for a difference in signaling between gp  and lps . this idea may be supported by another study showing that despite the use of similar prr, lps and peptidoglycan activated the il-1ra gene through different mechanisms/dna-binding proteins and acted synergistically in combination, suggestive of signals which are not equivalent in all parts  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our data demonstrated that in vitro glucan phosphate induced a transcription factor binding and a subsequent cytokine profile different from lps and also from tsst- <dig> and, moreover, switched a pro-inflammatory tsst-1-induced response to an il-1ra-mediated anti-inflammatory reaction. our results also generated new insights into a very complex interplay of transcription factor binding to various known and newly identified sites in the il-1ra promoter , which can be regulated differentially by a fungal carbohydrate. together with the in vivo studies  <cit> , our findings might support the concept of protective effects mediated by glucan phosphate in pro-inflammatory conditions, especially with a dysregulated il-1β/il-1ra ratio  <cit> .
