BACKGROUND
crop production in open-field and greenhouse conditions is strongly committed to the intensification of agriculture and reduction of pesticide use, principally in response to regulatory, health, environmental and commercial constraints. pest and disease resistant cultivars are key elements for pathogen control, and the development of effective rotation systems  <cit> . therefore, breeding for disease resistance has become an important topic in most crop improvement programmes. many resistance genes  are already being used in agriculture and face three major constraints:  the limited number of cultivated species with r-genes available;  the lengthy process of breeding r-varieties with high agronomic standard;  the emergence of virulent populations, able to overcome the resistance conferred by some of the r-genes, which is favoured by the continuous monoculture of cultivars carrying the same r-genes . the promotion of durable resistance, defined as a resistance remaining effective for a long period of time during its widespread cultivation in environments favouring disease development  <cit> , is still an ongoing quest and a major issue.

recent research showed that management strategies of the resistance sources can increase the durability of the resistance. firstly, the choice of the r-gene and of the genetic background in which the major r-gene is introgressed are determinant and can be optimized  <cit> . as an alternative to single-gene deployment, combinations of several alleles in a single genotype, also called gene pyramiding, are expected to increase the number of mutations required from the pathogen for virulence, which may also increase the associated fitness penalty  <cit> . gene pyramiding has been successfully applied in combining multiple genes for qualitative disease resistance such as bacterial blight resistance  <cit>  and blast resistance  <cit>  in rice, powdery mildew resistance in wheat  <cit> . the durability of the resistance depends on the time taken for new mutations or recombinations to generate the matching combination of virulence factors in the pathogen population and for that pathotype to establish itself in the population. however, the requirement for agronomic performance, does not always allow the breeder to fully use the genetic diversity available in r-genes and genetic backgrounds. therefore, increased research efforts have been made to identify spatio-temporal r-cultivars deployment strategies and cultivation methods to maximize durability  <cit> . the sequential  use of distinct r-genes in rotation  or the mixture of lines carrying distinct r-gene in the same plot, may lower the emergence of virulent populations by diversifying the selection pressures for mutations in avirulence genes and avoid the potential bust of resistance when a single r-gene is deployed over a large area  <cit> . pyramiding, mixture of lines, and alternation deployment have not been widely used, owing to the time required for breeding assortments of r-genes into elite cultivars and the difficulty to implement field experiments in practice. therefore, in the literature, building new sustainable cropping systems relies on mathematical models of pathogen evolution  <cit> . the gene pyramiding strategy was empirically used in several crops. however, the pyramiding, mixture and alternating strategies were never compared experimentally, especially for intensive vegetable cropping systems. these strategies were recently compared in a review of theoretical and experimental use of pesticides in agriculture and drugs in medicine  <cit> . it showed that all the strategies can succeed in delaying the evolution of pathogen populations towards resistance to the pesticides or drugs, depending on the genetics of drugs resistances, but the combination of molecules  outcompetes the other strategies.

plant-parasitic nematodes are among the most damaging and uncontrollable pests of cultivated crops causing severe economic losses in world agriculture, estimated to $us  <dig> billion per year  <cit> . the specialized and intensive vegetable crops agriculture is becoming particularly vulnerable to a few species belonging to the group of root-knot nematodes . they are obligate plant endoparasites, found throughout the world in tropical, subtropical and warm-temperate areas in which several nematode generations can be completed per year. these polyphagous nematodes are one of the main pathogens on many solanaceous crops but also of most vegetable crops  which are part of the rotation in intensive protected cropping systems  <cit> . the parasite pressure due to these soilborne pests in vegetable crops has increased steadily following the new regulations that have withdrawn the use of most chemical nematicides  <cit> . host resistance is considered as an important component of integrated management of rkns  <cit> . because few r-genes acting against these pests are currently available, it is urgently needed to protect them and promote their durability.

in pepper, five distinct me genes were identified in local populations, that control different species of meloidogyne   <cit> . some of these genes have only recently been used in plant breeding and the risk of resistance breakdown by pathogen adaptation has already been demonstrated under laboratory experiments with high inoculum pressure of nematodes  <cit> . previous experimental studies showed that two genes  differ in their mode of action, particularly in the spatio-temporal localisation of the hypersensitive reaction  triggered by rkn penetration into the roots  <cit> . me <dig> induces early cellular necrosis in the root epidermis adjacent to the juveniles whereas me <dig> induces a late hypersensitive reaction in the vascular cylinder of infected roots, thus inhibiting the development of egg-laying females  <cit> . interestingly, virulent populations were obtained for me <dig>  both in natural  and artificial  conditions, whereas, to date, no evidence showed the emergence of me1-virulent populations  <cit> , which suggests a possible relationship between the mode of action of these r-genes and their durability. in this pathosystem, virulence gain was shown to be highly specific to the targeted r-gene and associated to a reproductive fitness cost  <cit> . such trade-offs between virulence traits and fitness-related traits suggest that, although the resistance can be broken, it may be preserved by pertinent management strategies.

the interest in the rkn model system is based on its originality compared to other plant pathogens. first, the parasitic pressure that is applied by rkns to their host plants is theoretically low: small population size  as the total progeny of a female), long biological cycle . second, the biological features of rkns that govern their evolutionary potential should not favour the emergence of virulent populations, according to mcdonald & linde  <cit> : lack of sexual reproduction for the major species , active dispersal capacities reduced in soil. however, as observed in other pathosystems, previous studies in tomato and pepper showed that virulence can emerge in laboratory as well as in fields, depending on the resistance gene used, and the genetic background it has been introgressed in  <cit> . the rkn model studied here will contribute to the generalization of strategies for the breeding and deployment of resistant cultivars.

in this study, we evaluated several r-gene deployment strategies to implement a rational use of pepper r-cultivars, with the objective to improve the sustainable management of rkns in vegetable cropping system. experiments were conducted in climate-controlled rooms and in greenhouses, under 3-year field conditions, comparing i) the use of a single r-gene introgressed in a partially resistant vs. a susceptible genetic background, ii) the alternance of two r-genes in rotation, iii) the mixture of genotypes bearing distinct r-genes in the same plot, and iv) the pyramiding of two r-genes in a single genotype.

RESULTS
the five pepper  genotypes used in this work are inbred lines with differential resistances to rkns. doux long des landes  is a susceptible cultivar. the two resistant doubled-haploid  lines, dh <dig> and dh <dig> produced through in vitro androgenesis were previously described  <cit> ; they are homozygous for the me <dig> and me <dig> genes, respectively  <cit> . two f <dig> hybrid were also used, one carrying me <dig> in its heterozygous state in the dll susceptible genetic background , and one combining the two r-genes me <dig> and me <dig> .

climate controlled room experiment
three m. incognita isolates were used: m. incognita morelos is a me1- and me3-avirulent isolate; the me3-virulent laboratory-selected isolate was obtained from m. incognita morelos and reared by successive re-inoculation on the me3-pepper dh <dig> line as described in material and methods; the me3-virulent natural isolate was collected on resistant peppers carrying me <dig> in the experimental field of creat, la baronne, france. five hundred to  <dig> hatched second-stage juveniles  were inoculated to six to seven-week-old plants according to the experiment described in material and method. comparison of the pepper genotypes for the number of egg-masses  after a drastic pressure of inoculum  shows that all r-peppers were not at all or very slightly infected  compared to the susceptible control dll   . the me <dig> r-peppers with fifty percent of susceptible dll genetic background  had mean ems of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  compared to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for dh <dig>  a total of  <dig> and  <dig> ems were collected from the roots of  <dig> dh <dig> and 70 f <dig>  r-peppers, respectively. no progeny could be obtained from ems collected on dh <dig> by repetitive inoculation. the reproductive rate rr =  <dig> . a first generation progeny was obtained from ems collected from the f <dig>  but did not succeed in producing a second generation so that rr was not determined. a total of  <dig> ems were collected from the roots of  <dig> dh <dig>  r-peppers. these ems contained 264 ±  <dig>  eggs per em . a virulent line was reared by successive re-inoculation on dh <dig> me3-peppers. after three successive re-inoculations, the mean number of eggs per em  was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . no em was obtained from the f <dig>  r-peppers combining me <dig> and me <dig> 

figure  <dig> compares the reproduction potential of avirulent and me3-virulent laboratory-selected or natural m. incognita isolates on the different pepper genotypes after inoculation with  <dig> juveniles . all three isolates succeeded in producing ems on the susceptible pepper dll, mean of ems ranging from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for the virulent laboratory-selected isolate to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for the natural virulent isolate. the avirulent isolate was mostly unable to reproduce on the resistant peppers  except on me <dig> r-peppers with fifty percent of susceptible dll genetic background  for which  <dig> ems were obtained from 15 f <dig> plants. the two me3-virulent isolates were able to reproduce on me3-peppers , but they were not able to infect any me1-pepper tested ; 11 ±  <dig>  ems were counted on f <dig>  infested with the me3-virulent natural isolate but only  <dig> eggs were obtained from the ems and they were not viable .

field experiment
the experiment was carried out in a tunnel of 224 m <dig>  subdivided in  <dig> microplots of one square meter each naturally infested with a mixture of meloidogyne incognita and m. arenaria as described in material and method. each scare-meter plot harboured five plants of a given pepper modality from april-may to october, followed by a cultivation cycle of susceptible lettuce in winter. six cultivation modalities were compared during three years: 1) the succession of the same r-gene  introgressed in a partially resistant genetic background , 2) the succession of the same r-gene  in a f <dig> hybrid issued from a cross with a susceptible genotype ), 3) the alternance of single r-genes in rotation  the first year, me <dig>  the second year, then me <dig>  the third year), 4) the mixture of lines bearing single r-genes  or me <dig> , respectively) grown in the same plot, 5) the pyramiding of two r-genes  in a single genotype  and 6) the susceptible cultivar  as control.

the evolution of the root infestation of peppers, during the three successive years for the six modalities, respectively, is presented in figure  <dig>  the gall index  was determined using a  <dig> to  <dig> scale as described in material and method. as expected, the susceptible cultivar dll, cultivated in naturally-infested plots, exhibited high infestation levels over the whole experiment . conversely, the five modalities that include r-genotypes showed a significant reduction of the number of galls on their root systems , whatever the r-gene and the management strategy considered . however, differences were noticed among the five modalities. after one year of cultivation, the homozygous line dh <dig> did not show any gall , while the level of infestation progressively increased during the second and third year . the same trend was generally observed for the other modalities, the highest infestation level being observed in the case of the heterozygous f <dig>  after the third year of cultivation . for the mixture, galls were only observed on dh <dig> . the only notable exception is reported for the f <dig>  pyramiding me <dig> and me <dig>  which remained almost uninfested over the three years . in order to evaluate the potential selection of m. incognita isolates virulent against me <dig> or me <dig> during the experiment, eggs recovered from r-peppers were hatched and the resulting second-stage juveniles  used to reinoculate the same r-genotype. ems sampled on dh <dig> contained more than  <dig> eggs on average, and a virulent line was successfully reared by successive re-inoculation on dh <dig> peppers. after three successive re-inoculations, the mean number of eggs per em was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . few or numerous ems were recovered from me <dig> peppers, homozygous  or heterozygous , respectively, but they contained few eggs . the eggs obtained the first and second year on both genotypes, and the third year on dh <dig>  did not survive to the first re-inoculation. nevertheless, some nematodes obtained from eggs collected the third year on heterozygous f <dig>  survived and were reared by successive inoculations on the same genotype. after three successive re-inoculations, only  <dig> ems were obtained . very few ems were recovered from the f <dig>  peppers combining me <dig> and me <dig>  and no virulent population was obtained after re-inoculation on r-plants .

figure  <dig> shows the gi on susceptible lettuce each year after each pepper modality. lettuce plants were cultivated in winter when the cycle of nematodes is slowed. so the mean gi did not exceed five on a scale from  <dig> to  <dig>  moreover, the lettuces were harvested in february the first year, when air temperature did not exceed 7°c; the second and third year, they were harvested in march with air temperatures reaching 16°c to 20°c, respectively. this could explain that the gi were higher the second and third years on the lettuces for all modalities.

after the first year of pepper cultivation, a significant reduction of gi  was observed in the lettuce cultivated after pepper r-genotypes compared to lettuce cultivated after the susceptible pepper dll . differences were noticed among the five modalities after two additional cycles of cultivation. for three modalities, i.e., susceptible peppers, cultivation of f <dig>  and mixture of resistant peppers carrying me <dig> or me <dig>  no protection effect on lettuce was observed after three cultivation cycles. contrarily, the three other modalities, i.e., dh <dig>  alternance, and especially pyramiding of me <dig> and me <dig> allowed protecting the lettuces during the three years: gi raised up to  <dig>  in year three after dll and only  <dig>  after f <dig>  peppers combining me <dig> and me <dig> 

these results are in agreement with those comparing the evolution of rkn soil infection potential  during the three years of experiment . the sip was evaluated counting the number of ems on susceptible tomato plants inoculated with one kg-rhizospheric soil sampled from each microplot at 15 cm depth before and after peppers or lettuces as described in material and method. in the first year of the experiment, before planting the pepper genotypes, the sip of the whole plot was moderate to heavy . the succession of susceptible plants every year  greatly increased sip in corresponding microplots . after two months of bare soil, no significant changes in sip could be observed. resistant peppers dh <dig>  f <dig> , and mixture dh <dig> and dh <dig> did not significantly reduce the sip over three years of experimentation compared to sip before planting the peppers. in contrast, the results highlight the beneficial effects of two management strategies of resistance: the cultivation of hybrids combining two resistance factors and alternating rotation of varieties, each carrying a different resistance. considering the me3/me <dig> alternance, the sip doubled after the first year of dh <dig>  cultivation  with the emergence of a me3-virulent population. the second year, after dh <dig>  cultivation the sip was reduced from 874 ±  <dig> to 78 ±  <dig> . however, the sip increased again the third year after dh <dig>  cultivation. considering the f <dig>  combining me <dig> and me <dig> strongly reduced the sip as soon as the first year , this reduction being almost complete in some microplots, when hairy root peppers were particularly developed through addition of an organic amendment and proper fertirrigation. this “trap plant” effect was maintained over the three years. the final level of reduction using this modality was  <dig> % of the mean initial rate recorded in the  <dig> plots.

discussion
the laboratory and field experiments performed in this study aimed at assessing different strategies of host resistance management for their impact in three main components of the crop protection against root-knot nematodes: the ability to delay or prevent the adaptation of the pathogen to the resistance , the efficiency in protecting the crop carrying the r-genes , and the potential in protecting the subsequent  crops included in the cropping system. in the following discussion, we will compare the performances of the different strategies in addressing these three aspects.

the durability of the resistance depends on the resistant genotype and management strategies
we showed that the choice of the r-gene is of crucial importance: unlike me <dig>  that was rapidly overcome after successive re-inoculations in laboratory experiments or by natural field isolates, me <dig> was either not or difficult to overcome under laboratory conditions or field conditions and only when it was weakened in a very susceptible genetic background. this validates, under natural field conditions, previous results obtained under controlled conditions  <cit>  which also showed that these two genes induce distinct resistance mechanisms, the me <dig> gene inducing early cellular necrosis in the root epidermis adjacent to the juveniles whereas me <dig> induces a late hypersensitive reaction in the vascular cylinder of infected roots, thus inhibiting the development of egg-laying females  <cit> . the importance of the choice of the r-gene for a better durability of resistance linked to the mechanism of resistance was also pointed out in several pathosystems  <cit> . it showed that a few strong r-genes can be deployed for long periods and that results obtained in laboratory or small field experiments can adequately reflect the mechanisms acting over large geographical scales and longer time periods. despite the higher durability of the me <dig> gene, our field experiments showed that the gall index increased in the f <dig>  plots, with the potential emergence of a new me1-virulent population. previous report  <cit>  already showed that the efficiency of me <dig> and me <dig> genes did not depend on allelic dosage  but on the genetic background. the durability of this gene may have been affected by its heterozygous status in the f <dig> or by the susceptible genetic background of this f <dig> as shown in other pathosystems  <cit> . these studies suggested the presence of additional genes or quantitative trait loci  that may have epistatic interactions with the primary resistance determinants, or may increase the number of virulence mutations required in the pathogen genome to breakdown the resistance, as suggested by palloix et al. <cit> . in pepper, experiments are now underway to detect and localize such qtl, and to determine their effectiveness in protecting the major r-genes.

when comparing the number of ems produced by the avirulent isolate and those produced by the virulent ones  on the susceptible pepper dll , we observed significant differences for avirulent versus me3-virulent laboratory-selected  and the same tendency, but not significant, for avirulent versus me3- naturally virulent . however, the difference became significant in this last case comparing the rr  . the present study reinforces our previous observations suggesting that a fitness cost reduces the nematode reproduction on the susceptible plants because of unnecessary virulence  <cit> . the virulence cost  was estimated as follows: ch  = 1—rr/rr  <cit> . here, the virulence costs on susceptible pepper were estimated at  <dig> % for the me3-virulent laboratory-selected isolate and at  <dig> % for the me3-virulent natural isolate.

alternating the two r-genes in rotation proved partly efficient in decreasing the nematode populations. indeed, the nematode population selected by the me <dig> pepper the first year was strongly depressed by the me <dig> pepper the second year, but increased again with me <dig> pepper the 3rd year. this probably resulted from the variations in population size of the me3-virulent nematodes. indeed, castagnone-sereno et al. and djian-caporalino et al. showed, in different nematode populations, that the virulence gain towards mi- <dig>  me <dig> or me <dig> in pepper was specific of the targeted r-gene  <cit> . the alternating strategy proved partly efficient in decreasing temporarily the pre-existing me3-virulent population. because of the absence of cross-virulence, alternating with me <dig> peppers is reciprocally expected to prevent the emergence of new me1-virulent variants as observed in the continuous deployment of me <dig> in the f <dig> hybrid.

the mixture strategy  did not provide a significant protection of me3-peppers since the me3-virulent fraction of the nematode population increased continuously over the three years with increased damages on me3-peppers. the mixture strategy may have decreased the level of epidemics due to the reduced density of susceptible plants as advocated by pink  <cit> . however we got no evidence that it delayed the increase in frequency of virulent nematodes, despite the very limited dispersion ability and absence of sexual reproduction of rkns which are expected to favour resistance durability  <cit> .

the pyramiding of the two r-genes proved to be the only management practice which totally suppressed the emergence of virulent isolates, both in laboratory with high inoculum density experiments and in the 3-year field experiment. in theory, pyramiding into a single cultivar several r-genes that have the same spectrum of action but that differ in their mechanisms should provide a more durable resistance, since mutational events at several avirulent loci would be required simultaneously to produce a new virulent pathotype  <cit> . the pre-existence of me3-virulent nematodes in the field may endanger the pyramiding strategy, facilitating the further emergence of both me <dig> and me1-virulent nematodes. however, no multivirulent genotype emerged, that probably resulted from the extremely low nematode population in these plots after one year of f <dig>  peppers cultivation, preventing the emergence and selection of such genotypes.

comparing the management strategies for their ability to protect the resistant cultivars from virulence emergence, provided contrasted results in our experiment. the continuous use of a single r-gene,  proved a risky strategy with the potential emergence of virulence after three years, particularly when the r-gene was introgressed in a susceptible background. the mixture of r-lines proved not efficient, due to the increase in frequency of a pre-existing virulent nematode genotype. alternating two r-genes that differ in their mechanisms seemed partly efficient and offered the possibility of ‘recycling’ broken r-genes due to the strict specificity of virulence. finally, pyramiding two major r-genes that differ in their mechanisms into a single cultivar seemed the most secure and durable strategy.

efficiency of the management strategies in protecting the successive drops in the rotation
these management strategies were also compared for their ability to minimize damage in the targeted crop  and to decrease the soil infectious potential, thus securing crop rotation including further susceptible hosts. the continuous cultivation of me <dig> peppers provided different results depending on the carrier genotype: the dh line  <dig> proved efficient in decreasing the damage in pepper and in lettuce . this was related with a low to intermediate sip all along the three cultivation cycles. conversely, with the f <dig> , the gi in pepper and lettuce increased progressively to intermediate  or very high  levels, and the sip remained rather high. this is related to the increase in em numbers observed in the f <dig> hybrid compared to the resistant parent dh <dig> in laboratory experiments. introgressing the r-gene in susceptible cultivars with heterozygous status decreases the efficiency of the resistance and results in an increase in the reproduction and maintenance of the pathogen population. this was already known in other pathosystems such as tomato-m. incognita, cotton-m. incognita, and rice-xanthomonas oryzae <cit> . recent results indicated that this effect is due to the genetic background rather than the heterozygocity of the r-gene  <cit> . it clearly confirmed that the way of breeding resistant cultivars can affect the efficiency of the rkn r-genes in addition to their durability, as previously mentioned.

in presence of a me3-virulent population, alternating with another r-gene like me <dig> was efficient to cut down the nematode population  and to protect the susceptible crops in the rotation . it allowed using again the broken r-gene me <dig> in the following cycle of cultivation and provided a partial protection of the susceptible lettuces despite the significant increase of the sip after me <dig> r-peppers. this indicated that me <dig> will need to be used again to decrease the me3-virulent population that developed in the previous cycle and maintain the sip at acceptable level.

mixture of dh <dig> and dh <dig> did not significantly reduce the sip over three years of experimentation, except the first year when the roots were highly developed. implementing a root growth stimulation when using r-plants could so increase the “trap plant” effect and thus decrease the amount of pathogens in the soil. a multiline protocol was tested to control rice blast  in yunnan province, china, with striking success  <cit> . in the present experiment, the sip value did not increase as much as observed with a succession of susceptible crops , however it was maintained, probably due to the selection of me3-virulent nematodes. this reduced the mean gi in pepper, but resulted in a high gi on lettuces after three years, reaching that obtained after dll susceptible peppers. in this situation, the mixing strategy proved not efficient to protect the susceptible crop on the long term.

the pyramiding strategy proved highly efficient in protecting the pepper crop, as expected from laboratory experiments, but also the following susceptible crop all along the three years. indeed, the sip fell down as soon as the first cultivation of peppers combining the two r-genes and never increased again. peppers are not known for any nematicide activity, but very probably act as traps. the use of trap plants is a nematode management technique that has been tested periodically since the late 1800’s . nematicidal plants used include arachis hypogeae , cucumis metuliferus  or solanum sisymbriifolium <cit>  but are difficult to introduce in vegetable crop rotations. susceptible hosts  have also been used to trap rkn juveniles, but have to be destroyed before the completion of the life cycle of the nematode  <cit> . r-plants are more efficient trap crops as nematodes are killed in the roots, avoiding the destruction of the plants before the end of the nematode life cycle. r-peppers, specially the f <dig>  peppers combining me <dig> and me <dig>  provide a new trap crop in intercropping and integrated pest management, and for crop diversification in vegetable cropping systems.

to conclude on the strategies that minimize damage in the targeted crop and decrease the soil infection potential, securing crop rotation including susceptible hosts, the sequential use of a single r-gene introgressed in a susceptible background proved inefficient and the mixture of r-lines also lost efficiency as soon as one of the r-gene was broken down. alternating two r-genes that differ in their mechanisms was partly efficient in maintaining a low inoculum level in the long term, but pyramiding two major r-genes into a single cultivar outcompeted the other strategies, providing a high protection level of the resistant cultivar  and a causing a sharp and stable drop of the soil infectious potential. moreover, the availability of molecular markers closely linked to each of the me r-genes  <cit>  makes the identification of digenic genotypes possible and will help breeders to construct novel resistant pyramid genotypes.

CONCLUSIONS
looking at three components of crop protection –durability of resistance, efficiency of resistance, and sustainability of rotating cultivation- provided the same hierarchy of management strategies with pyramiding > alternating > mixture > sequential use of a single r-gene introgressed in a susceptible background. looking to the adaptation of xenobiotic to drugs and pesticides, a very similar hierarchic efficiency of strategies was observed by the resistance to xenobiotics consortium  <cit> . based on literature review, they showed that the combination of molecules  outcompeted the other strategies  in delaying the emergence of resistance to drugs and pesticides. the superiority of molecules combination over the other strategies appeared to be robust particularly when resistance to each drug in the combination was controlled by independent loci , leading to “multiple intragenerational killing” of the pathogens at the individual level. me <dig> and me <dig> are two distinct r-genes with different modes of action  <cit>  and no cross-virulence effects  <cit> . moreover, pyramiding appeared very promising as rkn “traps” plants, reducing up to 90% the infestation rate of the soil, protecting the winter susceptible crops. decreasing the amount of pathogens in the soil may also increase the durability of r-genes because the appearance and early increase in the frequency of virulence alleles in the pathogen population depends on the balance between mutation rates and population size  <cit> . when pyramiding remains difficult for breeders, alternating may offer the possibility of ‘recycling’ broken r-genes provided that virulence is specific. results of this study are expected to suggest rules for breeders and farmers for the sustainable management of disease resistance.
