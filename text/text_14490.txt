BACKGROUND
the aryl hydrocarbon receptor  is a well-known transcription factor that is involved in the detoxification response to pollutants and intrinsic biological processes of multicellular organisms. ahr forms a complex with ahr nuclear translocator  and regulates the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes.

ahr has been shown to be activated by xenobiotics including benzopyrene and  <dig> , <dig> -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, and it induces the expression of genes containing an xre domain in their promoter region  <cit> . the genes, which are activated by ahr, include loci encoding the cytochrome p <dig> family, which is responsible for the phase i detoxification response, enzymes metabolizing endobiotics and xenobiotics, and other molecules that function in cell differentiation  <cit> . in addition, ahr is one of the stress response molecules in mouse hepa1c1c <dig> cells; crosstalk between ahr and nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-related factor  <dig>  mediates the oxidative stress response through nadh dehydrogenase quinone  <dig>   <cit> . miao et al. demonstrated that nrf <dig> transcription is directly modulated by an activated ahr  <cit> . ahr has been studied not only as a mediator of chemical toxicity but also as a regulator of vascular development or angiogenesis  <cit> . vascular endothelial growth factor  is a potent angiogenic factor that plays a central role in angiogenesis, and it is a recognized gene marker for angiogenesis  <cit> . vegf expression is induced by various environmental stresses, nutrient deprivation  <cit> , and hypoxia  <cit> . glucose deprivation, one of the nutrient deprivations of mcf-7/adr cells, induces the expression of cellular homologs of oncogenes and angiogenic factors  <cit> . these results support the hypothesis that glycolytic metabolism is associated with cancer malignancy  <cit> . in human hepatoblastoma hepg <dig> cells, glucose deprivation induces vegf expression  <cit> . we reported that the nuclear localization of ahr was induced in hepg <dig> cells in low glucose conditions  <cit> . the ahr localization induced not only cytochrome p <dig> family  <dig> member a <dig>  and 1a <dig> expression but also nrf <dig> expression. in addition, ahr mediates tcdd induced vegf expression  <cit>  and relates to angiogenesis in mouse  <cit> . in this study, we report a novel pathway that induces vegf expression in hepg <dig> cells in response to glucose deprivation. the response to glucose deprivation that is mediated by ahr induces vegf expression through activating transcription factor  <dig>  expression in hepg <dig> cells.

RESULTS
glucose deprivation induces vegf expression through ahr in hepg <dig> cells
in the hepg <dig> human liver carcinoma cell line, glucose deprivation, or hypoglycemia, enhances vegf mrna expression  <cit> . when the medium was exchanged from high glucose medium  to no glucose medium , vegf mrna expression was increased in hepg <dig> cells at  <dig> and 24 h after the medium exchange . correspondingly, the expression level of protein was increased under glucose deprivation at  <dig> and 24 h after the medium exchange and secreted vegf was increased under glucose deprivation at 24 h after medium exchange .

vegf is a potent angiogenic factor that plays a central role in angiogenesis  <cit> , and angiogenesis is a significant step in the pre-malignancy and malignancy of cancer  <cit> . we expected that ahr was related to the process of cancer cell malignancy. tryptophan- <dig> -dioxygenase -derived kynurenine promotes tumor cell survival through ahr with the progression of cell malignancy  <cit> . ahr is translocated to the nucleus by low glucose conditions in hepg <dig> cells. ahr that is translocated to the nucleus activates cyp1a <dig>  1a <dig>  1b <dig>  and nrf <dig> expression in hepg <dig> cells in low glucose conditions  <cit> . we expected that the nucleus-translocated ahr was related to vegf expression that was induced by glucose deprivation. when ahr expression was knocked down by rnai, vegf expression did not change in normal glucose conditions . under glucose deprivation , vegf expression was suppressed by rnai against ahr . the expression and secretion of vegf protein were clearly suppressed by rnai against ahr under glucose deprivation .

ahr and vegf pathway analysis in silico
figure 1d, e and f show that ahr is required for increased expression of vegf in hepg <dig> cells in glucose deprived-conditions. however, there are no ahr binding regions on the transcriptional regulatory domain of vegf. therefore, we expected that ahr did not regulate vegf expression directly. we tried to extract candidate vegf transcriptional regulators that could be induced by glucose deprivation through in silico analyses using ingenuity pathway analysis . we extracted the molecules that were classified as “regulation of expression” and could possibly regulate vegf expression directly . moreover, the candidate molecules of interest were those molecules that could be integrated into the pathway where ahr was a starting molecule and vegf was at the end of the pathway. as a result, atf <dig>  estrogen receptor  <dig> , and endothelial pas domain protein  <dig>  were integrated into the ahr to vegf pathway . in low glucose conditions, ahr induced nrf <dig> expression  <cit> . similarly, in no glucose conditions, ahr induced nrf <dig> expression . in nuclei, phosphorylated nrf <dig> protein induced the expression of atf <dig> protein  <cit>  and bound to atf <dig> protein  <cit> . we expected that atf <dig> has the high possibility for interacting with ahr through nrf <dig> and inducing vegf expression. therefore, we focused on the atf <dig> interaction with nrf <dig> 

ahr regulates atf  <dig> expression under glucose deprivation in hepg <dig> cells
the atf <dig> transcript level was higher after  <dig> and 24 h of culture in glucose-deprived conditions than in high-glucose conditions . the protein levels differed between glucose deprivation and high glucose after 24 h of cell culture, but they did not differ much after 12 h of culture . there are no reports that ahr regulates atf <dig> expression directly. according to our current in silico analysis, ahr possibly regulates atf <dig> expression through nrf <dig>  fos, ccaat enhancer-binding protein alpha , maf, and p <dig>  in hepg <dig> cells, ahr knockdown suppressed atf <dig> expression in glucose-deprived conditions , and the expression level of atf <dig> protein was suppressed by ahr knockdown . these results indicate that atf <dig> is included in the ahr pathway and that ahr regulates atf <dig> expression.

atf <dig> but not nrf <dig> mediates the induction of vegf in glucose deprivation
atf <dig> was shown to induce the stress-induced expression of vegf  <cit> . in addition, atf <dig> regulates vegf expression in stress-induced angiogenesis, which interacts with nrf <dig>  <cit> . in hepg <dig> cells, the ahr pathway regulates the stress-induced expression of nrf <dig> <cit> . therefore, we raise the following  <dig> hypotheses: a) nrf <dig> induces vegf expression by activating atf <dig> expression; b) protein interactions between nrf <dig> and atf <dig> induce vegf expression; and c) atf <dig> activates vegf expression independent of nrf <dig> in stress-induced angiogenesis .

glucose deprivation-induced expression of vegf was examined using rnai against atf <dig> or nrf <dig> at the mrna and protein levels . when hepg <dig> cells were cultured under high glucose conditions, rnai against atf <dig> did not affect vegf expression. however, when hepg <dig> cells were cultured under glucose-deprived conditions, atf <dig> knockdown suppressed vegf expression and secretion . in contrast, nrf <dig> knockdown did not affect vegf expression at the mrna and protein levels and secretion of the vegf protein . no appreciable change in atf <dig> expression at the mrna and protein levels occurred by nrf <dig> knockdown regardless of the glucose concentration .

discussion
lines of evidence suggest that ahr has important roles in cancer pathogenesis, promotion, and malignancy  <cit> . the activation of ahr by a typical agonist,  <dig> , <dig> -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin , has been shown to promote tumor formation in both liver and skin  <cit> . tcdd-mediated liver tumor promotion in multistage rat hepatocarcinogenesis has been studied in detail because of its relevance in xenobiotic-induced toxicity  <cit> . the expression of mutant ahr molecules by mice and rats suggested that ahr plays a key role in liver tumor promotion  <cit> . in addition, kynurenine acts as an endogenous ligand of the human ahr, and the tdo-ahr pathway is associated with the malignant progression of human brain tumors  <cit> . takeuchi et al. and rhoman et al. have shown that ahr has a role for vegf expression and angiogenesis in mouse  <cit> . our results indicate that ahr regulates vegf expression through atf <dig> in glucose deprived-conditions in hepg <dig> cells . vegf is an important molecule in angiogenesis for tumor malignancy during carcinogenesis  <cit> . angiogenesis is well known as one of the malignancy stages of cancer progression. shweiki et al. raised the possibility of inducing vegf expression by hypoxia and glucose deprivation in c <dig> cells, a clonal glial cell line that is derived from a rat glial tumor  <cit> . several studies have demonstrated that glucose deprivation also induces vegf expression in different types of cells  <cit> . yun et al. reported that glucose transporter  <dig>  and 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose- <dig> -bisphosphatase- <dig>  are important molecules for vegf expression under glucose deprived-conditions in du <dig> cells, a human prostate carcinoma cell line  <cit> . glut <dig> and pfkfb <dig> are upregulated by hypoxia-inducible factor  <dig>   <cit> . therefore, the vegf pathway in glucose deprivation is possibly linked to a hypoxia response pathway.

cancer cells in poorly vascularized solid tumors are constantly or intermittently exposed to glucose deprivation as well as hypoxia  <cit> . glucose deprivation activates the unfolded protein response , a stress-signaling pathway in tumor cells  <cit> . the upr induces the expression of the transcription factor atf <dig> through perk  <cit> . glucose deficiency or deprivation induces ahr translocation into the nucleus, and the nuclear translocation of ahr activates not only cyp1a <dig> and cyp1a <dig> expression  <cit>  but also atf <dig> expression . however, there are no binding elements for ahr in the atf <dig> transcriptional regulatory domains, suggesting that other molecules mediate ahr-atf <dig> regulation. ahr forms a dimer with arnt, and the ahr-arnt complex can bind to dioxin-responsive elements to activate the transcription of various genes, including cyp1a <dig> and 1a <dig> <cit> . tumor cells in the microenvironment of a solid tumor are exposed to hypoxia and/or nutrient deprivation. in the microenvironments within a solid tumor, angiogenesis is triggered by the expression of various molecules including vegf.

to understand the response of liver cancer cells to nutrient deprivation, we propose  <dig> hypotheses for the ahr-regulated pathway that induces vegf in glucose-deprived hepg <dig> cells: a) nrf <dig> induces vegf expression by activating atf <dig> expression; b) protein interactions between nrf <dig> and atf <dig> induce vegf expression; and c) atf <dig> activates vegf expression independent of nrf <dig> .

glucose deprivation-induced expression of vegf was examined at the mrna and protein levels using rnai against atf <dig> or nrf <dig> . when hepg <dig> cells were cultured under glucose deprivation, atf <dig> knockdown suppressed vegf expression . in contrast, nrf <dig> knockdown did not affect vegf expression at the mrna and protein levels and secretion of the vegf protein . no appreciable change in atf <dig> expression at the mrna and protein levels resulted from nrf <dig> knockdown regardless of the glucose concentration . these results clearly indicated that atf <dig> activated vegf expression independent of nrf <dig> in the glucose-deprived hepg <dig> cells. we adopt hypothesis c as illustrated in figure  <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
the ahr is well known as a ligand-activated transcription factor and transcriptional regulator for drug-metabolizing enzyme, cyp <dig> family genes. ahr translocates into the nucleus following ligand binding and forms a complex with arnt. the ahr-arnt complex binds to the xre domain to regulate target gene expression. in conclusion, the ahr pathway, which involves atf <dig>  induces vegf expression in glucose-deprived human hepatoblastoma hepg <dig> cells. ahr translocates into the nucleus in response glucose deprivation in hepg <dig> and regulates gene expression. however, there are no binding domains of ahr on the transcriptional regulatory domain of atf <dig>  we expect that there are some mediators between the ahr translocation into the nucleus and atf <dig> expression. the pathway from ahr to vegf through atf <dig> is a novel pathway in glucose-deprived liver cancer cells, which is related to the microenvironment within cancer tissue that affects liver cancer malignancy.
