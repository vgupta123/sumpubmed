BACKGROUND
periodontitis is an infectious disease in which genetic, microbial, immunological, and environmental factors combine to influence disease risk and progression, resulting in the destruction of tooth-supporting tissues  <cit> . there is growing evidence showing that a number of complex human diseases are caused or are influenced by periodontal diseases, including cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, and rheumatoid arthritis  <cit> . a major etiological agent in the development and progression of chronic periodontitis is porphyromonas gingivalis, a black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobic bacterium  <cit> .

establishment of infection by pathogens depends on a readily available iron, and for some bacteria a heme source. however, iron and heme availability is limited in the host environment and therefore bacteria evolved sophisticated systems to acquire these compounds from host hemoproteins. among them, gram-negative bacteria utilize outer-membrane receptors directly or with the assistance of a hemophore  <cit> . unlike other gram-negative bacteria, p. gingivalis does not produce and utilize siderophores. the bacterium also lacks the majority of enzymes of the biosynthetic pathway for heme biosynthesis. therefore, p. gingivalis must acquire heme as a sole source of iron and protoporphyrin ix. in p. gingivalis, several tonb-dependent outer-membrane receptors for heme utilization have been described, including hmur, tlr, ihta, and husb  <cit> . the best characterized system of heme acquisition in p. gingivalis consists of proteins encoded by hmu operon, comprising the hmur and hmuy proteins. hmur is an outer-membrane tonb-dependent receptor involved in heme transport through the outer membrane  <cit> , whereas hmuy is a membrane-associated heme-binding lipoprotein  <cit> . we reported that hmuy binds iron protoporphyrin ix and iron protoporphyrin ix at 1: <dig> molar ratio  <cit> . detailed characterization of the hmuy-heme complex demonstrated that heme, with a midpoint potential of  <dig> mv, is in a low-spin fe hexa-coordinate environment  <cit> . in that report we identified histidine residues at positions  <dig> and  <dig> as potential heme ligands. crystallographic analysis determined unique beta-fold hmuy protein structure and confirmed engagement of h <dig> and h <dig> in heme binding  <cit> . we also demonstrated that hmuy binds iron mesoporphyrin ix and iron deuteroporphyrin ix in an analogous way to heme  <cit> . the only differences observed were two forms of hmuy-iron deuteroporphyrin ix complex differing by a 180° rotation of porphyrin around the α-γ-meso-carbon axis. recently we showed that hmuy forms complexes with non-iron metalloporphyrins, though recognition of the ligand by hmuy depends on the central metal ion  <cit> . among them, gappix, coppix, and cuppix exhibited antimicrobial activity against p. gingivalis <cit> . similar to hemophores, hmuy was demonstrated to wrest heme from methemoglobin  <cit> . heme extraction from oxyhemoglobin was facilitated after oxidation to methemoglobin by pre-treatment with p. gingivalis r-gingipain a  and k-gingipain   <cit>  or prevotella intermedia interpain a  <cit> . heme uptake served by hmur receptor and hemophore-like hmuy lipoprotein is novel and has been identified for the first time in p. gingivalis.

in this work we report structural features of hmuy variants and the protein’s conformational changes induced by temperature and studied by means of fluorescence spectroscopy. studies presented in this work have been performed using the wildtype hmuy protein and its variants with single tryptophan residues replaced by alanine or tyrosine residues. due to the widespread location of tryptophan residues in hmuy, one could expect that observation of tryptophan fluorescence spectra could help to explain local structural stability of the protein and conformational changes accompanying ligand binding.

methods
site-directed mutagenesis and protein purification
the dna sequence encoding p. gingivalis hmuy polypeptide part lacking the first  <dig> residues  and cloned into phmuy <dig> plasmid  <cit>  served as a template for mutagenesis. single tryptophan residues were replaced by alanine or tyrosine residues using quikchange ii xl site-directed mutagenesis kit . primers designed and used in this study are listed in table  <dig>  all hmuy protein variants were overexpressed using respective plasmids and escherichia coli er <dig> cells , and purified from a soluble fraction of e. coli lysates as previously described  <cit> . molecular modeling of hmuy protein variants was performed with the gromos <dig> implementation of swiss-pdbviewer .

preparation of holoproteins
hemin  solutions were prepared and uv-visible titration experiments were carried out as described previously  <cit> . holoforms of all hmuy variants were formed by incubating apoprotein with heme in the molar ratio 1: <dig> . excess heme was separated by gel filtration using a pd- <dig> desalting column  or zeba spin desalting columns . hmuy concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using the empirical extinction coefficients ε <dig> =  <dig>  mm- <dig> cm- <dig> and ε <dig> =  <dig>  mm- <dig> cm- <dig> for apo- and holoform, respectively, determined as reported previously  <cit> . extinction coefficients of hmuy variants constructed in this study were calculated analogously using the following equation:

 ε280n=ε280dan280ad <dig> 

where ε280d is the theoretical extinction coefficient  whilst an <dig> and ad <dig> are absorbancies of native and unfolded protein in  <dig> mm phosphate buffer ph  <dig> , containing  <dig> mm nacl and the same buffer containing  <dig> m guanidine hydrochloride , respectively. the empirical extinction coefficients are as follows: ε <dig> =  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  mm- <dig> cm- <dig> for w51a, w73a, w161a, w51y, w73y, w161y, respectively. titration curves were analyzed using equations for a one-site binding model and kd values determined as reported earlier  <cit>  using the originpro  <dig> software .

circular dichroism  spectroscopy
far-uv cd spectroscopy was carried out using a jasco j- <dig> spectropolarimeter. protein samples at  <dig> μm concentration in  <dig> mm sodium phosphate buffer, ph  <dig> , were measured in a 10-mm path-length cell. the spectra were recorded over a wavelength range of 190– <dig> nm by signal averaging of four spectra. scanning speed of  <dig> nm/min and step resolution of  <dig> nm were used. all spectra were baseline corrected for respective buffers.

intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy
intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence emission spectra were recorded using a jasco fp <dig> spectrofluorometer. protein samples at  <dig> μm concentration in  <dig> mm sodium phosphate buffer, ph  <dig> , containing  <dig> mm nacl were excited at  <dig> nm and emission spectra were recorded in the range of 300– <dig> nm, at a scanning interval of  <dig> nm and integration time of  <dig> s. all spectra were baseline corrected for respective buffers. for analysis of heme binding,  <dig> μm protein samples in  <dig> mm sodium phosphate buffer, ph  <dig> , containing  <dig> mm nacl were titrated with 1-μl aliquots of  <dig> mm hemin prepared as described previously  <cit> . fluorescence was determined at excitation at  <dig> nm and emission at  <dig> nm.

thermal denaturation
unfolding experiments were performed according to standard protocols with modifications described previously  <cit> . changes in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence emission spectra due to thermally induced protein unfolding were monitored at  <dig> nm for excitation at  <dig> nm using a jasco fp <dig> spectrofluorometer. protein samples at concentration of  <dig> μm in  <dig> mm sodium phosphate buffer, ph  <dig> , containing  <dig> mm nacl and  <dig> m gdnhcl  <cit>  were heated  in 10-mm path-length cells with time/temperature interval of 1°c per minute.

sypro orange  exhibits intensive fluorescence when bound to hydrophobic residues of proteins and therefore it was used as a probe for thermal unfolding of hmuy. samples of  <dig> μm proteins in  <dig> mm sodium phosphate buffer, ph  <dig> , containing  <dig> mm nacl were placed in a 96-well qpcr plate and sypro orange was then added according to the manufacturer’s instructions . after 1-h equilibration at 25°c the plate was heated up to 80°c in an mx3005p thermocycler  with a rate of  <dig> °c per  <dig> s. fluorescence was monitored by a single photomultiplier tube  detector using a frox filter . fluorescence data were transformed to yield the relative fraction of unfolded protein  <cit> .

RESULTS
p. gingivalis hmuy possesses three tryptophan residues at positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> , evenly distributed in the polypeptide chain and protein structure; w <dig> is buried in the interior of the heme binding cavity whilst w <dig> and w <dig> are located closer to the protein surface at the loops between β-strands forming the central twisted β-sandwich structure of the holohmuy . furthermore, w <dig> is partially exposed on the holohmuy surface just at the joint of the protein core and a protruding β-hairpin, forming a heme binding site that contains h <dig>  one of the iron coordinating histidines  <cit> . due to the widespread location of tryptophan residues one could expect that observation of tryptophan fluorescence spectra can help to explain local structural stability of the protein and conformational changes accompanying ligand binding. therefore we constructed protein variants of the hmuy protein with single tryptophan residues replaced either by alanine or tyrosine residues . in this study, we attempted to obtain a maximum effect of lacking a tryptophan side chain on structural stability of the protein by replacing it with an alanine residue. in contrast, tyrosine substitution was expected to preserve the minimal free energy of the holohmuy native conformation. even though subtle structural changes were imposed by some aminoacid replacements, as observed from far-uv cd spectra , they did not significantly affect hmuy function since all protein variants preserved highly similar affinity to heme binding compared to the wildtype protein, as examined by fluorescence analysis  and determination of heme dissociation constants .

a tryptophan in a hydrophobic environment exhibits a maximum wavelength of the fluorescence emission spectra at 320– <dig> nm, while in a hydrophilic or exposed environment it exhibits a maximum at 340– <dig> nm  <cit> . therefore intrinsic fluorescence emission, by selective excitation of tryptophan residues, was used to probe local conformational fluctuations in hmuy. when excited at  <dig> nm, all proteins show rather wide fluorescence emission spectra. the wildtype hmuy and all but the w51y protein variants show maxima within a wavelength range from  <dig> to  <dig> nm. however, tyrosine substitution of the apo-form of w <dig> results in slight blue shift of the spectrum maximum to  <dig> nm. it is again in good agreement with w <dig> being exposed to the more polar environment. interestingly, w51a mutant has a maximum at  <dig> nm, which may result from structural differences of the protein variant imposed by the lack of a large aromatic side chain on the protein surface that normally would make the structure more rigid, protecting it from penetration by solvent molecules.

heme binding results in quenching of hmuy intrinsic fluorescence and holohmuy retains about 14% of the fluorescence intensity of the apoform . spectra of the wildtype holohmuy and substituted holow <dig> or holow <dig> are comparable. in contrast, w73a and w73y protein variants reflect only about 5% of initial apohmuy intensity after heme binding. it is noteworthy that replacement of w <dig> has a different effect on the apo- and holoform of the protein. , pointing to w <dig> fluorescence being quenched more severely in the hmuy-heme complex with greater exposure to the hydrophilic exterior of holohmuy in comparison to apohmuy.

while w <dig> is the most buried tryptophan residue in the protein core its impact on fluorescence spectra of native protein is marginal. both alanine and tyrosine w <dig> variants have almost identical fluorescence spectra as the wildtype hmuy , which implicates that w <dig> residue is completely quenched. this may be due to aromatic ring π stacking between w <dig> and proximal f <dig>  in addition, high energy states of w <dig> indoile group can be discharged by formation of the hydrogen bond between side ring nitrogen of w <dig> and the main chain carbonyl oxygen of y <dig>  similarity in spectra of apohmuy and holohmuy as well as of w <dig> variants suggest that both hydrogen bond and tryptophan and phenylalanine ring arrangements remain the same in both protein forms.

substitution of w <dig> or w <dig> by either a tyrosine or an alanine residue results in loss of about 18% or 60% of apohmuy fluorescence intensity . w <dig> and w <dig> residues are located in close proximity to each other and in holohmuy, as can be seen in the crystal structure  <cit> , w <dig> being the most exposed tryptohpan residue to a more hydrophilic environment on the protein surface. therefore energy from w <dig> can be transferred to w <dig> and then quenched due to the polar environment of the latter. this also explains why fluorescence spectra of each protein variant do not sum to the spectra of the wildtype protein. since w <dig> seems not to contribute to the spectra of apohmuy, w51a, w73a, w51y and w73y can serve as representatives for protein variants where only fluorescence emission spectra of w <dig> or w <dig>  respectively, can be observed. we assumed that spectra of w73a and w73y simply represent fluorescence of w <dig> whilst spectra of w51a and w51y correspond to fluorescence intensity of w <dig> when none of its energy is transferred to w <dig>  thus, it has been useful for observation of hmuy thermal unfolding and concluding conformational changes accompanying ligand binding.

our predictions were well reflected in the experimental observations from hmuy thermal unfolding experiments and alanine substitutions of tryptophan residues generally resulted in greater destabilization of hmuy structure compared with tyrosine substitutions . the most profound effect of the lack of a large hydrophobic side chain was observed for w <dig> as the difference in tm between apow73y  and apow73a  was 15°c . the same differences for protein variants with affected w51y  or w51a  and w161y  or w161a  were 8°c and 10°c, respectively . this tendency was preserved for heme-loaded proteins : w73y  or w73a , w51y  or w51a , w161y  or w161a . in all cases, replacement of the w <dig> exposed on the surface resulted in significant loss of protein stability and even the large aromatic side chain of a tyrosine residue had little potential to substitute this tryptophan residue. in contrast, replacement of the most buried w <dig> with a tyrosine residue only moderately affects protein stability: apow161y  or holow161y  versus apohmuy  or holohmuy . alanine substitution of w <dig> showed a greater effect on hmuy stability, but w161a still remained the most stable of all alanine-substituted variants . it is worth noting that w <dig> and w <dig> of hmuy, compared with w <dig>  which is unique for p. gingivalis, are conserved among homologous hmuy protein sequences found in other bacteria  <cit> . we suspect that they may be important for conformational stability of hmuy protein and participate in tertiary changes allowing heme binding.

thermal unfolding of hmuy protein variants was further monitored using sypro orange fluorescence . interestingly, apow161y mutant unfolds analogously to the wildtype apohmuy  . heme binding raises w73y stability to the level of the wildtype apoprotein . lack of compensation of the destabilization introduced by replacement of the w <dig> residue by ligand binding emphasizes the key role of this residue in preserving protein folding. in general, higher tm values were observed for processes monitored with sypro orange probe. discrepancies between melting temperatures obtained using different techniques may result from different phenomena being observed. sypro orange binds to the denaturing protein and offers the possibility to observe general exposure of hydrophobic side chains to the solvent whilst changes in intrinsic protein emission fluorescence are sensitive to local environment distortions around selected tryptophan residues. one may also not exclude possibility that differences observed may result from different buffers used. previously, we reported that thermal denaturation of hmuy in  <dig> mm sodium phosphate buffer, containing  <dig> mm nacl was irreversible, leading to protein precipitation  <cit> , but addition of  <dig> m gdnhcl resulted in a reversible process. under these conditions apo- and holohmuy preserved their native conformations and holo-hmuy retained bound heme  <cit> , thus demonstrating that under the concentration used gdnhcl did not cause protein denaturation and allowed analysis of hmuy stability using intrinsic fluorescence. to analyze general denaturation process using syproorange fluorescence,  <dig> m gdnhcl was omitted because it interferes with the probe.

finally, it should be noted that hmuy may function as monomer and, especially after heme binding, may form dimers and tetramers  <cit> . therefore, influence of oligomerization on protein stability and heme transfer should be taken into consideration. however, in this study we assumed that under conditions used  hmuy is present in solutions in the form of a monomer. such assessment was based on our preliminary, unpublished data . these data suggest that hmuy oligomerization may occur at higher protein and salt concentration  <cit> .

based on our data, one may expect conformational changes occurring during heme binding to hmuy and probably during heme release from hmuy. we propose that hmuy first binds free heme or preferably wrests heme bound to hemoproteins, mainly hemoglobin, and then releases it for subsequent binding to hmur. the initial step in heme unbinding may involve disruption of only one of the two axial histidine ligands of hmuy. our previous studies showed that single replacement of h <dig> or h <dig> by an alanine residue did not result in abolishing heme binding, which at least in part may support this hypothesis. this reversible intramolecular coordination by a histidine chain may allow heme transfer from hemoproteins to hmuy and subsequently to hmur, similar to typical bacterial hemophores. it has been shown that the hemophore hasa from serratia marcescens <cit>  or pseudomonas aeruginosa <cit>  exhibits large rearrangements, allowing heme binding to h <dig> and y <dig>  however, a recent study demonstrated that h <dig> is not conserved in all secreted hemophores. for example, hasa from yersinia pestis coordinates heme with a single y <dig> and its structure in both apo- and holoform is almost identical  <cit> . thus, analysis of heme binding to hmuy is of importance in understaning heme transfer into the p. gingivalis cell.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we demonstrate differential roles of tryptophan residues played in the hmuy conformational stability. we also hypothesize that the changes observed may result from different tertiary structure of apo- and holohmuy. at least so far, we were unable to solve the three-dimensional structure of apohmuy, allowing detailed comparison of apo- and holoforms. therefore results gained in this study may at least in part support our hypothesis of tertiary changes allowing heme binding to p. gingivalis hmuy.
