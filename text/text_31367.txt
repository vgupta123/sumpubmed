BACKGROUND
brassica napus is found almost solely in an agricultural setting represented by the oil crops oilseed rape  and vegetable/fodder crops swede and rutabaga. as one of the most commercially important oil crops, it is grown in most temperate regions of the world including north and south america, europe, australia, and east and south asia, for the production of vegetable oil for human consumption, industrial uses including as a lubricant or biofuel, and a protein meal used as animal feed.

brassica napus is an amphidiploid species  derived from a recent hybridization event between brassica rapa  and brassica oleracea  . it probably arose and was selected in human cultivation within the past  <dig>  years. it is widely accepted that brassica species diverged from a common ancestor with the arabidopsis lineage ~ <dig> mya  <cit> . similarly, the a and c genomes diverged from a common ancestor ~ <dig> mya. since the divergence of the two lineages leading to the genera brassica and arabidopsis, there has been a triplication event that created a hexaploid ancestor unique to the tribe brassiceae  <cit> . this is supported by evidence from ~ <dig>  restriction fragment length polymorphism  loci in the brassica a and c genomes that were mapped to homologous positions in arabidopsis  <cit> , along with evidence from comparative linkage mapping between b. juncea, b. oleracea, b. rapa and arabidopsis  <cit>  and fish analysis  <cit> . these events occurred after ancient whole-genome duplications found in arabidopsis ancestors   <cit> . a recent study of the distribution and rate of synonymous substitutions in homologous sequences among brassica and arabidopsis has suggested that the triplicated b. rapa  genome may also have undergone a process of genome shrinkage  <cit> .

genetic linkage maps represent a key resource to understand genome organisation, evolutionary relationships, and to assist in the assignment and orientation of sequence assemblies to correct chromosome locations. in addition, dense linkage maps provide the basis for map-based cloning of major genes and qtls underlying agronomic traits, as well as for marker-assisted selection. in b. napus, a range of sequence tagged genetic markers, including restriction fragment length polymorphism , simple sequence repeats  and single nucleotide polymorphisms  have been developed both from arabidopsis and brassica species. various versions of linkage maps, derived from a range of reference b. napus mapping populations, have been published within the last twenty years  <cit> .

development of a high density integrated genetic map of b. napus derived from well established mapping populations will provide a superior tool for high resolution mapping and verification of dna sequence contig order and orientation. benefits arise from incorporating information derived from the increased number of individuals and chiasmata represented within the populations. since the parent lines are genetically diverse, a larger proportion of markers will be informative and so enable a higher number of mapped markers to be obtained from the potential number of markers available. for several crop species such as maize  <cit> , soybean  <cit> , barley  <cit> , sorghum  <cit> , wild wheat  <cit> , grapevine  <cit> , cowpea  <cit>  and peanut  <cit> , integrated consensus linkage maps of multiple mapping populations have been developed. in brassica, early attempts  <cit>  to align linkage maps derived from different brassica populations were based on very low numbers of shared markers, and suffered from lack of resolution with respect to distinguishing between paralogous loci. more recent efforts have been successful in generating aligned maps for the brassica a genome that integrate marker information using a common set of ssrs scored in b. rapa and b. napus  <cit> .

although conceptually simple, in practice construction of an integrated map from diverse sources  is a non-trivial exercise. this is particularly true where genetic maps have been generated from different populations or sub-populations with different subsets of informative genetic markers. the situation is exacerbated where multiple paralogous loci may exist as a result of chromosomal segmental duplication over relatively recent evolutionary time, which in the case of b. napus is compounded by amphidiploidy. this may lead to a low number of shared  markers between maps. moreover, the quality of genotype data may vary across studies, thus hampering the progress of genetic map integration.

several systematic approaches have been proposed to construct integrated maps. early attempts involved pooling genotype information from several segregating populations, and then relying on conventional mapping algorithms  to build a single composite map  <cit> . however, this method has some shortcomings. firstly, mapping populations may be of different types  and have different estimates of genetic distance. pooling information cannot be applied to all combinations of populations, since treating data from different sources equivalently is flawed. secondly, once a composite genotype matrix is generated from several populations it contains a large proportion of missing data, where conventional mapping algorithms will tend to generate maps of low quality. alternative approaches have involved modification to mapping algorithms, such as employed by joinmap  <cit>  and carthagène  <cit> . these software packages take into account all available information from each individual dataset  and estimate the marker order and genetic distances of common  markers using regression mapping  or multiple 2-point maximum likelihood . since both methods involve exhaustive search of objective functions, the computational process to search for an optimal map is very time consuming. this becomes limiting for map integration that involves a very large number of markers and/or populations. a third approach, mergemap  <cit> , relies on graph theory  <cit>  and uses directed acyclic graphs  to represent maps from individual populations, and to resolve conflicts between maps. although mergemap does not make use of genotype data, simulations have shown that mergemap can outperform joinmap in terms both of accuracy and running time  <cit> .

in this study, we report the first genome-wide integration of brassica genetic maps based on an automated implementation of a defined algorithm. we selected three extensively studied b. napus dh mapping populations, bnasndh, bnasgdh and bnadydh, since they share a high number of loci derived from common genetic marker assays. a range of different published and unpublished sources of genotype data have been collated and curated for each population. our approach involved first constructing a population-specific consolidated map by merging constituent genotype matrices for each mapping population following initial assignment to each of the  <dig> lgs. a skeleton map that consists solely of representative markers from each bin was then prepared for the subsequent map integration for each population. we were able to compare the contrasting approaches employed by joinmap and mergemap, and then to investigate models of genome collinearity within the brassicaceae, and the relationship between genetic and physical distances.

RESULTS
the first stage of the integration process involved combining map data from previously published sources with new genotype score datasets, primarily from a large number of ssr markers for each of the three dh populations. this not only increases the map density and represents more recombination events, but also for the purpose of map integration potentially provides additional 'bridge' information between populations.

population-specific consolidated maps for three dh populations
bnasgdh_03_2010a is the first published map derived from the bnasgdh population, and includes  <dig> rflp and  <dig>  ssr marker loci. in addition to  <dig>  rflp markers used previously in the bnasndh population  <cit> ,  <dig>  ssr markers were included in the bnasndh_05_2010a consolidated map. in the bnadydh_05_2010a map, there were  <dig> ssr and  <dig> other genetic markers, including rflps, aflps, rapds and snps. the population specific genetic maps comprised  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  unique mapping loci . the elimination of unlikely local double crossovers and selection of representative markers to form population-specific bin maps greatly reduced the initial inflated lengths of the lgs, by up to 50%, with average lg lengths varying from  <dig> to  <dig> cm in the three mapping populations. the lengths of lgs among all three population-specific maps were positively correlated .

segregation distortion within the three dh populations
comparison of the three dh populations indicated that the proportion of mapped loci displaying segregation distortion  varied from 22% to 49% . the proportion of loci showing segregation distortion within the bnasndh_03_2005a map  <cit> ,  <dig> %, was slightly lower than that within our consolidated bnasndh map bnasndh_05_2010a.

loci that showed segregation distortion were detected by the calculation of locus genotype frequency where the χ <dig> test is significant .

the most extreme segregation distortion in bnasndh was observed in lg a <dig>  with  <dig> out of  <dig> loci  mostly clustered in the top arm. the bnasndh a <dig> showed an average skewed ratio of  <dig> : <dig> over its entire length , favouring alleles from syn <dig>  the female parent. in bnasgdh, several lgs showed segregation distortion along almost the entire lengths . for example, all  <dig> loci in c <dig> showed segregation distortion , favouring alleles from female line psa <dig>  in bnadydh, the most extreme case of segregation distortion was found on a <dig> where  <dig> out of  <dig> loci  showed segregation distortion, favouring alleles from the male parental line yudal. the bnadydh a <dig> showed an average skewed ratio of 1: <dig>  instead of 1: <dig> over its entire length .

conservation of marker orders between populations
comparison of marker orders between the three population-specific consolidated maps indicated good agreement over most of the lgs . marker orders were strongly positively correlated between bnasndh and bnasgdh, with a mean correlation coefficient of  <dig>  . a <dig> was an exception . this could result from an observed inversion between bnasgdh and the other two maps on a <dig> . for some lgs, the number of shared markers was very low between populations . in these cases it was difficult to judge the overall consistency of marker order among maps, as reported by correlation coefficients. thus there was no significant correlation reported with many bnadydh lgs. however, marker order was conserved within those lgs where sufficient bridge markers  allowed for assessment of statistical significance . this provided more confidence for the subsequent use of bridge markers for the map integration.

the level of significance is shown by asterisks. significance is shown as: * <  <dig> ; ** <  <dig> ; *** <  <dig> ; **** <  <dig> .

integration of genetic maps using joinmap and comparison with population-specific maps
the bnawait_01_2010a integrated linkage map contains  <dig>  markers representing  <dig>  unique loci  . map integration using joinmap  <dig>  was based on representative markers from the population-specific bin-maps, including ~20% of all markers as bridge markers across populations . the a genome is represented by  <dig>  markers and the c genome  <dig>  . the total genetic length for the integrated maps is  <dig>  cm, with a mean length of  <dig>  cm per lg. the lengths of lgs for bnawait_01_2010a in relation to all three population-specific maps were significantly positively correlated . although on average there are  <dig>  markers per map interval, this ranges from one to  <dig>  the mean map density is a locus per  <dig>  cm . this corresponds to a locus every  <dig> kbp, based on the estimated size of  <dig>  mbp  <cit>  for the b. napus genome. the distribution of map intervals was highly skewed, with a preponderance of shorter distances . the marker density was  <dig> marker every  <dig>  cm , or  <dig> marker every  <dig> kbp .

comparison of the marker order between the population-specific and integrated maps indicated overall good agreement . for  <dig> lgs, there was good agreement between the integrated and population-specific maps . for a further five lgs the agreement in marker order was good for two of the pairwise comparisons . for a <dig>  a <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> there was a relatively low level of agreement, although the marker order was still significantly positively correlated between the three component and integrated maps. this could be due to the local order discrepancies between component maps. when there are inversions in specific populations, the use of an integrated map alone may not be informative. map alignment of different populations  and dot-plots  became powerful tools to indicate genetic regions where maker order differs among population-specific maps.

since there were very few markers in common between some lgs, it implied that the integrated map bnawait_01_2010a was likely the best estimate of a map. joinmap  <dig>  generates two alternative maps  where a group of poorly fitting representative markers in the skeleton map were excluded from the analyses. we reported the two alternative integrated maps and the spearman's rank correlation test between these two integrated maps and population-specific maps for all  <dig> lgs . the bnawait_01_2010a integrated map appeared to be the best estimate of the integrated map for almost all  <dig> lgs, compared with the other two alternative maps, except for lg c <dig>  but  <dig> and  <dig> poorly linked representative markers were excluded from the two alternative integrated maps for c <dig>  respectively . in general, the marker orders were much conserved  among all three integrated maps generated by joinmap .

integration of genetic maps using mergemap and comparison with joinmap
we compared the pipeline incorporating joinmap with that using mergemap. the integrated map produced by mergemap, bnawait_01_2010b, had a total genetic length of  <dig>  cm, consisting of  <dig>  loci . the map density was thus one map position every  <dig> kbp, lower than that produced by joinmap . compared with joinmap, mergemap tended to generate integrated maps with much higher consistency of marker order compared with each population-specific map, with spearman's correlation coefficients > <dig>  across all lgs for all three populations .

comparison and calculation of the spearman's rank correlation in the marker orders for the integrated maps generated by joinmap and mergemap  indicated a good agreement between the two methods for most of the lgs. fifteen lgs had spearman's correlation coefficients > <dig> . not surprisingly, the four lgs with correlation coefficients < <dig>  were those where joinmap performed relatively poorly for the map integration . mergemap appeared to outperform joinmap in terms of marker order consistency between integrated maps and population-specific maps . one should note that mergemap achieved this by relying solely on the existing marker orders for each component maps, rather than making use of the information within the genotype data to perform the map re-calculation. it is clear that joinmap tended to produce more accurate estimates of genetic distances and resolve a greater number of unique marker loci for each lg compared with mergemap .

comparative mapping of b. napus and arabidopsis, and resolution of collinearity blocks
since the bnawait_01_2010a integrated map increased the marker density by more than  <dig> fold compared with the bnasndh_03_2005a map  <cit> , we were able to refine the recognised collinearity blocks and resolve additional blocks within the b. napus genome. sequence data were obtained for rflps and 'bbsrc', 'celera' and 'aafc' ssr canonical marker assays. homologous loci were identified within the arabidopsis genome .

we incorporated previously calculated homology results for  <dig> rflp markers  from parkin et al.  <cit> , which had been established with slightly less stringent criteria. we also identified homologous loci within sequenced b. rapa bac clones for rflp and ssr canonical markers, and used the annotation of  <dig> b. rapa bac clones  to infer the putative arabidopsis gene homology for markers whose relationship to arabidopsis sequence could not be identified directly. however, this only increased the proportion of markers in the integrated map with homology in arabidopsis by  <dig> %. local marker order was rearranged for  <dig> % of markers based on physical proximity within sequenced b. rapa bac clones. additional homology information was obtained for some pcr markers designed from arabidopsis sequences mapped in bnadydh . in total,  <dig> % of all genetic markers in the bnawait_01_2010a integrated map  displayed homology to arabidopsis, representing  <dig> % of all mapped loci in the bnawait_01_2010a integrated map. all the information of high-scoring segment pairs  and their relations to the bnawait_01_2010a integrated map are available in additional file  <dig> 

for the identification of collinearity blocks conserved between b. napus and arabidopsis genomes, we employed similar criteria to parkin et al.  <cit> . a conserved block was defined as being supported by at least four homologous loci with at least one shared locus within every  <dig> cm in b. napus, and at least one shared locus within every  <dig> mb in arabidopsis. based on these criteria, we detected  <dig> collinearity blocks in the b. napus genome in relation to arabidopsis, of which  <dig> showed a significant correlation in the marker order for shared loci between b. napus and arabidopsis . each block contained on average  <dig> shared loci, and had an average length of  <dig>  cm in b. napus and  <dig>  mb in arabidopsis. the blocks represent  <dig>  cm of the b. napus integrated map  and  <dig>  mb  of the arabidopsis genome sequence. it appeared that the mapped genetic lengths of conserved blocks were significantly positively correlated with the aligned physical chromosomal lengths of arabidopsis across all blocks . the longest conserved block in terms of genetic length was bnawait_a_ <dig> in a <dig> with the genetic length of  <dig>  cm , supported by  <dig> shared loci. the block with the highest number of shared loci was bnawait_c_ <dig> in c <dig> . the longest block in terms of aligned physical length was bnawait_a_ <dig> in a <dig> which was aligned to  <dig>  mb of arabidopsis chromosome  <dig> .

consistent with previous findings, we also found evidence of inversions and internal duplications within lgs relative to arabidopsis . in a <dig>  the blocks arising from chromosomal segmental duplications, bnawait_a_ <dig> and bnawait_a_ <dig>  were adjacent to each other with reversed orientation, consistent with an inverted duplication block . this has also been observed in the homeologous chromosome c <dig> in brassica oleracea  <cit>  and b. napus  <cit> . there was also evidence that some blocks overlapped with each other, and that some blocks were nested within other blocks. the overlapping genetic distances between blocks  varied from  <dig>  cm up to  <dig>  cm within lgs .

genome duplication within the brassica genome
the bnawait_01_2010a integrated map enabled us to investigate the global genome organization of b. napus relative to the arabidopsis genome. consistent with previous observations  <cit>  there were between  <dig> and  <dig> conserved collinearity blocks distributed across the  <dig> b. napus chromosomes for each arabidopsis block . it appeared that the arabidopsis blocks adopted in the bnasndh_03_2005a map  <cit>  were sufficient to describe the pattern of genome triplication in the bnawait_01_2010a map. there was stronger evidence for genome triplication within brassica for some arabidopsis blocks compared with others, supported by a higher number of shared loci and longer continuous collinearity block between the two genera across lgs . arabidopsis chromosomal regions having at least  <dig> continuous homologous copies within b. napus covered approximately 80% of the arabidopsis genome .

comparative mapping of b. napus and b. rapa a genome
the bnawait_01_2010a integrated map also enabled us to investigate the a genome evolutionary dynamics since the hybridization with the c genome. we mapped all sequence tagged markers used in the bnawait_01_2010a integrated map onto the b. rapa a genome anchored scaffolds  for each chromosome, and compared the marker order of genetic distances  with that of physical distances  using dot-plots and rank correlation.

marker order was globally conserved between the b. napus a genome integrated map and the b. rapa a genome anchored scaffolds across all  <dig> chromosomes despite some local discrepancies . in a <dig>  the correlation between the genetic length and the physical length appeared to be almost linear across the entire chromosome. the poorest correspondence between genetic and physical maps was found in a <dig> . in some regions of the genome, the local order was clearly shown to be inconsistent between the integrated genetic map of b. napus a genome and the b. rapa genome scaffolds, such as the top section of lg a <dig>  . the local correlation between the genetic distance and the physical distance in this region  appeared to be of opposite sign to the global correlation for the whole chromosome. this appeared to result from the fact that more than half of the loci in this region were physically mapped to the bottom of the chromosome . moreover, this region of  <dig> cm  covered ~ <dig> mb of physical length . interestingly, a <dig> also had the lowest correlations of marker order between population-specific maps and the bnawait_01_2010a integrated map . in a <dig>  both ends of the chromosome  together corresponded to ~90% of the genetic length. we further investigated two additional lgs, a <dig> and a <dig>  with relatively low correlations of marker order between population-specific maps and the integrated map, compared with other lgs in the a genome . both lgs also showed relatively lower correlations in the marker order between the integrated genetic map and the physical b. rapa genome sequences .

the level of significance is shown by asterisks. significance is shown as: * <  <dig> ; ** <  <dig> ; *** <  <dig> ; **** <  <dig> .

we then carried out the comparison of marker order between each population-specific consolidated map and the b. rapa genome scaffolds using rank correlation. it showed that for most of the lgs, the correlation coefficient was > <dig>  for all three individual population-specific maps in relation to the physical b. rapa scaffolds. this correlation was relatively weaker for lgs a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig> . interestingly, for a <dig>  both bnasndh_05_2010a and bnasgdh_03_2010a maps showed very high correlations, but the bnadydh_05_2010a showed a very poor correlation with the physical b. rapa scaffolds . the bnasgdh_03_2010a map also showed a similar pattern of discrepancy against the physical b. rapa sequence in a <dig>  the marker order discrepancies between some population-specific maps and the physical b. rapa sequence for some lgs may derive from the genome structural variation  between populations.

discussion
over the past two decades more than  <dig> substantial genetic maps have been published for different brassica species but little concerted efforts has been made to align maps from different populations. we have collated both published and previously unpublished genome-wide genotype data for sequence-tagged rflp and ssr markers scored on three widely used brassica napus populations of doubled haploid lines .

constituent genotype matrices for each of the  <dig> linkage groups  were first combined to generate a consolidated genetic map for each population. integration of component genetic maps involved selection either of bridge markers shared between populations or of markers with the highest information content to represent each unique mapping locus . the skeleton bin maps for the three populations were then combined to generate an integrated map for each lg, comparing two different approaches, one encapsulated in joinmap and the other in mergemap. joinmap made use of the full set of available genotype scores whilst mergemap made use of the marker orders and cm distances of the component maps. although the performance of mergemap depends on the quality and accuracy of marker order within component maps, this approach has been shown to outperform joinmap both in terms of accuracy and running time based on simulated data  <cit> , and has been used successfully to construct integrated maps in barley  <cit>  and cowpea  <cit> .

in the present study, a relatively low proportion of marker loci  were common to at least two populations. this may not provide sufficient information to overcome a few cases of uncertainty in locus order that were present in the component maps . however, for the purpose of map alignment/integration, the consistency of order among common markers between individual maps appeared to be more important than simply the number of shared loci. our results demonstrate that the marker order was generally well conserved  in the component maps, which provided a good foundation for the subsequent map integration analyses. indeed, both joinmap and mergemap generated integrated maps with good consistency in marker order  compared with component population-specific maps for most lgs . mergemap improved the marker order consistency for some lgs where joinmap performed relatively poorly .

there may be several reasons why joinmap appeared to perform relatively poorly for some lgs. this includes the low number of shared 'bridge' markers between component maps which may hide underlying conflicts in genotype ordering that is accessible to joinmap and not used by mergemap. resolving such conflicts in marker order is relatively straightforward for mergemap as it makes use of directed acyclic graphs  to generate a single directed graph according to their shared vertices. any ordering conflict between individual maps resulted in cycles in the combined graph. mergemap then resolves the cycles  by identifying and eliminating a small number of marker occurrences from some of the maps after weighting marker order differences. mergemap only requires the marker order and cm distances of the component maps rather than the data of original genotype scores of individual populations. thus it may be possible for consistent errors in the marker order or interval lengths in a majority of component maps to be incorporated into the integrated maps. however, in this study we can be reasonably confident that the component maps were a reliable representation of b. napus chromosomes, since the maps from independent populations and in different laboratories generated similar marker order. mergemap was therefore expected to produce a relatively reliable marker order in the integrated map. in contrast, joinmap is constrained by its need to resolve a consistent marker order in the integrated map based on a limited number of mean recombination frequencies and combined lod scores. for both methods, when the degree of marker order inconsistency increases between individual maps, the performance becomes relatively inferior. establishing the thresholds of such inconsistencies will be important for more extensive map integration where larger numbers of maps and/or reduced numbers of bridge markers are available.

furthermore, one should note that there would be always conflicting markers between/among different component maps to be merged . these conflicts of marker orders could be derived from the genome structural variation  between populations for some lgs or mapping errors. thus, low correlations between the integrated map and a particular population-specific map, along with good correlations between the integrated map and the other two component maps , could be indications of genome rearrangements in one of the populations. further investigation of the dot plots  may identify the event which creates such marker order conflicts.

as part of the pre-processing of genotype data prior to map integration, we carried out a masking of genotype scores where single data points were eliminated where a single locus was flanked by a double crossover. this process provides more consistent genetic lengths for specific linkage groups, and more realistic lengths between adjacent crossovers that represent exchange of large chromosomal regions. this process may also eliminate some actual genetic exchanges. however, since these would be short they will have only a small effect on the final map. following this procedure a degree of map inflation still remained compared with those published previously for bnasndh  <cit>  and bnadydh  <cit> , which is often encountered when large numbers of markers are employed due to the cumulative effect of the low background error rate. any overestimation of genetic length is incorporated into integrated maps calculated by mergemap. in contrast, joinmap makes use of all available pairwise recombination frequencies and lod scores, and so lg lengths were closer to expectation and appeared more reliable, with good agreement with previously published component maps. in addition, joinmap was also able to resolve a greater number of unique marker loci across all lgs, increasing the number of loci by  <dig> % compared with mergemap.

the heuristic method employed in mergemap greatly enhances the speed of map integration compared with the regression mapping algorithm employed in joinmap, especially where large genotype matrices are used. indeed joinmap is limited by the matrix size for dense maps, and so the problem needs to be broken down into sub-problems, either by bin mapping as we have done here, or by taking overlapping sub-sections of lgs, which does not provide an ideal solution. pragmatically, where accurate estimates of genetic distances are not the priority, mergemap provides a rapid and relatively reliable solution, especially where component maps have been generated with consistently low error rates for marker scores. the mergemap algorithm has been successfully applied for map integration where either a large number of genetic markers are involved, such as high-throughput snp genotyping  <cit> , or where genotyping data were not available for many published genetic maps  <cit> . however, joinmap still performed well in map integration based on our map construction procedure for the three b. napus dh populations.

overall, the bnawait_01_2010a integrated map generated by the joinmap method included  <dig>  markers, compared with  <dig>  markers in the previous reference bnasndh map of parkin et al.  <cit>  and  <dig> markers in the bnadydh map reported by delourme et al.  <cit> . this increased the marker density by  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold, respectively. furthermore, the nine lgs representing c genome chromosomes contain  <dig> % more markers and  <dig> % more loci than the ten lgs representing a genome chromosomes in the bnawait_01_2010a map. this is in close agreement with the estimated 16% larger size of the c genome  <cit> .

the bnawait_01_2010a integrated map enabled us to test existing models of collinearity between arabidopsis and brassica. this analysis was based on twice as many markers where sequence similarity to arabidopsis could be identified, compared with the bnasndh map of parkin et al.  <cit> . we identified  <dig> conserved colinearity blocks in b. napus relative to arabidopsis. these corresponded to almost all  <dig> b. napus blocks reported in the bnasndh_03_2005a map, although we did not resolve  <dig> short blocks previously identified based solely on rflp markers  <cit> . although the same homology hits were identified between the arabidopsis genome and  <dig> rflps within these  <dig> short blocks, the criteria to define a collinearity block  were not met in our study. moreover, these short blocks only represented < <dig> % of the total mapped length of the bnasndh_03_2005a map. five previously unreported collinearity blocks were identified in our study. however, these new blocks covered only  <dig>  cm of genetic length in total, aligned to  <dig>  mb in arabidopsis chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  we further established that the synteny order of the  <dig> collinearity blocks within the a genome of b. napus in bnawait_01_2010a is essentially the same as that established in b. juncea based on intron polymorphism  markers  <cit> . this indicates that synteny order is highly conserved in the a genomes of b. juncea and b. napus.

we attempted to align  <dig>  primer sequence pairs for the ssr markers to the arabidopsis chromosomes to identify homology with the resultant target 'virtual pcr product' of primers. however, <2% of the primer pairs had homology in arabidopsis, of which only 50% agreed with those identified using the corresponding ssr clone sequences. this suggests that future comparative studies within the brassicaceae based solely on ssr primer sequences are unlikely to provide useful information where sequences have diverged over similar time scales.

the increased marker density provided by the integrated map is a valuable resource that increases the availability of markers in regions of interest, thus assisting in fine mapping. it also provides additional information for comparative mapping studies, e.g., to detect potential genome rearrangements in some populations. furthermore, the increase in density of sequence tagged markers and availability of draft genome sequence scaffolds, enabled us to carry out a preliminary investigation of the relationship between genetic and physical distances in the brassica a genome. this indicated that the chiasmata were not evenly distributed within chromosomes, and that there was considerable variation in the pattern of crossovers between chromosomes. many studies have suggested the distribution of meiotic crossover events along chromosomes in plants and other species is non-random  <cit> . non-random distributions of crossover rates have been reported to be correlated with several chromosomal features, including chromosome size, gene density, presence of transposable elements or heterochromatin, and distance to centromeres  <cit> . however, the underlying mechanisms affecting chiasmata distribution may be taxa specific  <cit> , and so it is important to establish any relationships within or between brassica chromosomes and species. within the c genome of b. oleracea, a clear difference in relationship between genetic and physical distances has been established for idbs on c <dig>  <cit> . the analysis we have carried out is preliminary and any mechanistic understanding will require more complete genome sequence scaffold data that include details of the distribution of repetitive dna and of degree of chromatin condensation. in addition, it may be necessary to select additional markers that represent the full length of individual chromosomes. based on complete genome sequence data, drouaud et al.  <cit>  have been able to resolve details of non-random distribution of chiasmata in relation to heterochromatic knobs and other chromosomal feature on arabidopsis chromosome  <dig>  access to larger populations and more reliable sequence-tagged mapping methods  are likely to increase the resolution and understanding of the basis of variation in recombination frequency in brassica.

we also attempted to anchor the remainder of the unanchored a genome scaffolds onto lgs based on the b. napus integrated map, and this anchored three additional scaffolds. given the genome structure of brassica, some scaffolds will be in repeat-rich or duplication regions, and thus it is difficult to resolve the lg assignments.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have generated a comprehensive integrated map for the b. napus genome, which includes  <dig>  genetic markers mapped onto  <dig>  loci, with a total genetic length of  <dig>  cm. the map density of one locus every  <dig>  cm, corresponding to  <dig> kbp, increases by at least three-fold the marker density within the original maps. the bnawait map thus provides access to additional informative markers, which will assist in resolution and fine mapping of qtl regions, as well as facilitating marker-assisted introgression and selection in brassica crops. our map integration pipeline is readily applied to map integration studies for other genera. the population-specific consolidated maps and the integrated maps are publicly available http://www.cropstoredb.org/brassica and provide a valuable resource in fine mapping and comparative mapping studies for brassica research.
