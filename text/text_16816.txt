BACKGROUND
structural variation within the genome, including insertions, duplications, deletions, and inversions of up to multiple kilobase pairs, have recently been described in a variety of species, including humans  <cit> , mice  <cit> , rats  <cit> , silkworms  <cit>  drosophila  <cit> , and dogs  <cit> . these genomic variations were recently found to be widespread, encompassing 5% of the human genome  <cit> , and are thought to be involved in determining complex phenotypes  <cit> .

the contribution of structural variants  to complex phenotypes has been measured by association analyses of variance in gene expression levels  and the presence of svs. snps and svs have been shown to account for  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, of the total detected genetic variation in gene expression, with only a limited overlap  <cit> . the effect that svs have on gene expression is likely underestimated given the much less completeness and accuracy with which svs could be queried at that time. in humans, svs have been associated with sporadic and mendelian diseases, such as williams-beuren syndrome, mental retardation, and red-green color blindness. svs have also been associated with complex human traits, such as autism, schizophrenia, crohn's disease, and susceptibility to hiv infection  <cit> . because of their association with human diseases, the importance of svs has become increasingly apparent  <cit> . for most other species, including the major farm animals, chickens, cattle, and pigs, the extent and biological consequences of svs have remained largely unknown due to the lack of a cost-effective approach for detecting svs.

until recently, comparative genomic hybridization  was the most commonly used method for detecting svs  <cit> . fosmid paired-end sequencing, which is a more laborious technique, has been used to detect svs larger than  <dig> kb  <cit> . the inability to resolve smaller svs using array-cgh results in the over-representation of larger svs in current databases of structural variation . the resolution of array-cgh, though extremely costly, can be improved by using high-resolution whole-genome tiling arrays. most of these svs have been identified by methods that do not resolve sv end points at the base pair level. in addition, methods like array-cgh are based on a reference genome that currently does not encompass all svs within the population and, thus, is limited in scope. genomic regions that are the result of deletions not present in the reference genome are not captured by the array and not analyzed for svs.

next generation sequencing  technology was recently shown to be a powerful alternative to array-cgh for identifying genomic structural variation  <cit> . using paired-end sequencing, svs can be identified with single base pair resolution. moreover paired-end sequencing allows for the detection of balanced rearrangements in which there is no gain or loss of a genomic region, such as inversions and translocations, which cannot be identified by array-cgh. paired-end sequencing and mapping  involves sequencing the paired ends of fragments of known insert size from a genomic dna library and computationally mapping dna reads to a reference genome.

here, we used pem on reduced representation libraries  of pooled chicken dna samples. in the chicken genome, only  <dig>  svs have been described thus far  <cit> . these svs encompass  <dig> chicken-turkey inter-specific copy number variants  and  <dig> chicken-duck inter-specific cnvs, of which five cnvs overlap with inter-specific chicken-turkey cnvs  <cit> . in chicken, some phenotypes have already been linked to structural variation, including the pea-comb  <cit>  and late feathering  <cit>  phenotypes. with pem of an rrl, we provide a cost-effective approach for exploring the presence of svs at high resolution within four chicken breeds.

RESULTS
paired-end sequencing and mapping
to identify genomic rearrangements in the chicken genome, we applied massively parallel sequencing using the illumina genome analyzer platform to sequence both ends of the genomic dna fragments derived from the rrls. we used pooled samples from  <dig> individuals to construct alui rrls for a white egg layer line, brown egg layer line, and two different broiler lines. for the white and brown egg layer lines, the 150- <dig> bp alui fragments were used for creating the rrl; for the two broiler lines, 125- <dig> bp alui fragments were used. from the brown and white egg layer rrls, we obtained  <dig>  million and  <dig>  million raw reads, respectively, and from broiler  <dig> and broiler  <dig> we obtained a total of  <dig>  million and  <dig>  million raw reads, respectively. reads were filtered for the presence of the restriction enzyme tag and trimmed to  <dig> bases. we required a phred quality score  <cit>  of at least  <dig>  for each base in the 32-bp read. the fraction of read pairs for which both reads mapped back to the reference chicken genome  was 78% for broiler  <dig> and 77% for broiler  <dig> . in the layers, the fraction was 76%  and 73% . in all breeds the were approximately hundred thousand paired reads of which only one read mapped back to the reference genome, whereas up to 26% of the read pairs had no end uniquely mapping back to the reference genome.

paired-end sequencing of rrls resulted in the indicated number of raw reads per breed. sequencing read counts are in millions. mapping percentages are relative to paired l32q <dig> 

1paired l32q <dig> = paired reads had the rrl restriction tag trimmed to  <dig> bp and were filtered for a minimum per base quality of 20;

2concordant = both reads of a read pair mapped to the expected orientation relative to each other and in the expected distance according to the rrl size range;

3neither end = none of the reads of a read pair mapped to the reference;

4one end = only one read of a read pair was mapped;

5diff chr = both reads of a read pair mapped, but to different chromosomes;

6too short = both reads of a read pair mapped to the expected orientation relative to each other but at a closer distance than expected based on the rrl size range;

7too long = both reads of a read pair mapped at a larger distance from each other than expected;

8relative orientation = reads of a read pair mapped in another orientation relative to each other than expected based on the reference chicken genome.

to calculate the sequence coverage of the rrl, we estimated the number of fragments in the rrl by performing an in silico alui digest of the chicken genome build washuc <dig>  which resulted in  <dig>  fragments of 150- <dig> bp, whereas  <dig>  fragments of 125- <dig> bp were obtained. we calculated rrl sequence coverage based on the paired-end reads that passed our sequence quality filters. coverage of the rrls ranged from 11-13x in broiler lines to 18-20x in the layer lines, indicating that we analyzed, on average, 22-40% of the haplotypes of the  <dig> individuals used for constructing the rrl .

fragments were collected in corresponding size ranges as used in the in vitro rrl preparation. the total number of collected fragments and number of bases captured are indicators of what genome fraction was sampled. based on trimmed reads, the fraction of the genome actually sequenced was calculated. the number of raw read pairs obtained  divided by the number of fragments is an indicator of the rrl coverage.

the real sequence coverage of the rrl was estimated by clustering identical paired reads and plotting the distribution of clusters according to the numbers of reads per cluster . the majority of the fragments in the rrl was covered by  <dig> paired reads.

for each breed, we calculated insert sizes for paired ends that mapped in the correct orientation . the results show a peak at ~ <dig> bp and a shoulder of smaller fragments, indicating that the insert sizes were not equally distributed. the upper limit of fragment size was clearly demarcated at ~ <dig> bp, which corresponded well to the size range of the excised fragments. based on these results, the lower limit was estimated to be ~ <dig> bp in the layer lines and ~ <dig> bp in the broiler lines, which is consistent with the applied size selection. to eliminate false positives, we established size thresholds of  <dig> and  <dig> bp and considered mapping paired reads within this range as consistent with the reference genome.

rearrangements
in each breed, roughly  <dig> % of the mapping read pairs had no concordant alignment in the reference genome, referred to as discordant paired-end reads  <cit> , indicating a potential sv. discordantly mapping read pairs are those whose distance apart is less or greater than expected from the rrl size range or in another relative orientation than expected based on the reference genome . paired reads that mapped to two different chromosomes  were excluded from further analysis. discordantly mapping read pairs of the larger chicken chromosomes  with similar mapping coordinates and predicting a similar putative sv were clustered in  <dig>  clusters. clusters were classified as having an insert size that was too large , too small , or an incorrect orientation of ends  with respect to the chicken genome sequence.

because of the high number, not all of the clusters are presumed to represent a true genomic rearrangement, but some are incorrectly mapped reads caused by sequencing errors that result in low quality mapping. therefore, the average mapping quality of discordantly mapping read pairs was evaluated per chromosome compared to the average mapping quality scores of read pairs that mapped consistently within the reference genome. however, the average mapping quality of discordantly mapping reads was similar to the mapping quality of concordantly mapping read pairs . we also observed that the average coverage by paired reads differed up to two-fold between chromosomes, but the number of fragments per chromosome in the rrl correlated well with chromosome size.

the number of concordant and discordant  mapping read pairs per chromosome are given. the average mapping quality of concordantly and discordantly mapping read pairs was calculated per chromosome. by calculating the mapping density, the distribution of mapping read pairs over the genome were evaluated. mapping density was calculated by dividing the chromosome length by the number of concordantly/discordantly mapping read pairs. rrl density was calculated to ascertain the contribution of the rrl approach to differences in mapping density. rrl densities were calculated by dividing the chromosome length by the  estimated number of rrl fragments.

to be considered as a true putative sv cluster, we required both ends to have an average mapping quality similar to concordantly mapping reads, which was ~ <dig>  in total,  <dig>  clusters consisting of  <dig> deletions,  <dig> insertions, and  <dig> inversion breakpoints met this criterion. sv clusters predicting a deletion or insertion were further prioritized for confirmation screening on the basis of parameters listed in the methods section. to validate our approach for identifying svs, we initially evaluated  <dig>  predicted svs  using pcr to genotype pooled samples from the four chicken breeds with primers spanning predicted breakpoint junctions. a total of eight svs yielded a clear pcr product of the expected size . for these svs, pcr was performed on eight individuals from breeds in which the sv was confirmed to be present by the sv-specific pcr product . individual sv-specific pcr products typed homozygous for the sv were sequenced to disentangle the rearrangement at the base-pair level. the sequence analysis results for these eight identified rearrangements were all consistent with our sv predictions.

structural variants  13- <dig> were chosen before application of the empirical rule  × n > <dig>  whereas 50- <dig> were chosen after. span size is the distance  on the reference sequence spanned by discordantly mapping read pairs. the number of observed discordantly mapping read pairs that support the presence of this structural variant is given by n. cmp is flagged in case there were also concordantly mapping read pairs observed in that particular genomic region. discordantly mapping read pairs spanning an assembly problem in the reference genome are flagged in the re column. the alternative mapping quality of a predicted sv is the average mapping quality calculated over discordantly mapping read pairs within a cluster. deletion breakpoints are in the notation chr_start-stop, whereas insertion breakpoints are given in the notation chr_position. not acquired  breakpoints were due to false positive sv predictions whereas breakpoints for sv <dig> were not acquired for technical reasons and not accurately acquired in sv <dig> due to low sequence complexity. w = white egg layer; b = brown egg layer;  <dig> = broiler 1;  <dig> = broiler  <dig> 

*due to the low sequence complexity, the exact location of insertion could not be revealed

discriminating putative svs from false positives
the results suggest that the presence of concordantly mapping reads partly overlapping the predicted sv region did not correlate with the quality of sv prediction, whereas reference errors in the predicted sv region correlated negatively. furthermore, the results indicate that putative svs predicted by a single or a few discordantly mapping read pairs that mapped a slightly different distance than expected were false positives, whereas the majority of putative svs with greatly deviating mapping distances were confirmed as being true svs. with this limited number of observations, we formulated a simple but fitting rule to determine sv clusters with a high likelihood of representing a genomic rearrangement from false positives.

we hypothesize that the size range of targeted dna fragments isolated from the gel might contain a very small fraction of fragments outside the established size thresholds . this lack of proper separation is likely caused by migration artifacts caused by secondary dna structures. to compensate for this bias we required that svs, predicted based on discordantly mapping read pairs that mapped to the reference between  <dig> and  <dig> bp apart, meet a representation constraint. in our proposed validation rule, we assumed an inverse relationship between the span-size deviation of a predicted sv and the number of discordantly mapping read pairs  required to predict a true sv. we hypothetically state that svs meeting the abundance constraint  × n > <dig> can be validated as true deletions. we assumed that this empirical rule is also applicable to insertions predicted by read pairs that map  a distance of 32- <dig> base pairs. to test our empirical rule, we applied it to the subset of deletion  and insertion  clusters used in the previous validation study, obtaining  <dig> candidate putative deletions and two insertions. both insertion candidates  and a total of eight deletions , four of which narrowly met the rule constraints , were selected for confirmation. pcr-based genotyping analysis showed that all selected candidates were confirmed in the pooled samples . we also observed that the pcr-based sv genotyping results for pools correlated well with the predicted presence of a particular sv in the breeds based on the sequence dataset .

breed-specific and shared svs
genotyping results suggested that the presence or absence of svs in a particular breed is fairly well predicted by the sequencing data. therefore, we further analyzed  <dig> rearrangements  validated by our rule for breed specificity. we also analyzed breed specificity for  <dig> putative deletions that resulted from applying a less stringent read mapping quality constraint, which was also applied in previous sv detection studies  <cit> . the results were compared by plotting both data subsets in weighted venn diagrams . in the validated dataset of  <dig> deletions, we detected the most svs in broilers,  <dig> in broiler  <dig> and  <dig> in broiler  <dig>  whereas fewer svs were detected in the layer lines,  <dig> in white egg layers and  <dig> in brown egg layers. ten percent of the rearrangements were present in all four breeds. svs detected in white egg layers were 23% breed-specific, and the other 77% were evenly shared with the other breeds. the brown egg layers had the fewest breed-specific svs  and shared a remarkably high percentage  with broiler  <dig>  broiler  <dig> and broiler  <dig> showed similar percentages of breed-specific svs, and 36% of the svs in broiler  <dig> were shared with broiler  <dig>  applying a less stringent mapping quality constraint resulted in a 50% increase in svs, whereas the distribution of svs over the four chicken breeds remained approximately the same.

distribution of predicted svs
the majority of detected svs were small ; approximately 85% of all svs were < <dig> kb whereas 60% were < <dig> bp. however, we also predicted and validated svs spanning multiple kilobases. predicted svs validated by our rule were mapped to the chicken genome, and we observed an even distribution on the chromosomes . sequence annotations of the regions overlapping the identified svs were extracted from ensembl  <cit> ; 44% of the sv read pairs mapped within genes. the read pairs for a minor fraction of the svs  spanned predicted exons; these svs were analyzed for their effects on gene annotations or gene models . the majority of all predicted svs represented a putative deletion of low complexity and repetitive sequence motifs in intronic or intergenic regions . an exception is sv <dig>  representing a deletion within gene ensgalg <dig>  which has been annotated as dna glycosylase fpg <dig> 

putative deletions with breakpoints predicted in exons were further analyzed in ensembl  <cit> . involved transcripts and protein functions were identified and putative modifications recorded.

*breakpoints are estimated from the mapping results and might differ a few tens of bases from the exact genomic locations.

svs of data subsets aamq  <dig> and aamq  <dig> were annotated based on their mapping location on the chicken genome. svs were analyzed to determine whether they mapped within genes, within exons, or partially overlapped exons.

discussion
by sampling a portion of the genome from four chicken lines using stringent sv detection constraints, we detected  <dig> svs encompassing ~ <dig> kb. assuming considerable limitation in the detection of classes of svs by our method, the chicken genome may differ in svs to a greater extent than in snps. therefore, we counted the total number of nucleotides involved. the majority of svs identified by our method were small deletions, most of which resulted in a loss of repetitive motifs in intronic regions or a loss of unannotated sequences in intergenic regions. both insertions mapped to intergenic regions as sequences of a few tens of base pairs and low complexity. we also predicted rearrangements in coding regions, revealed the exact breakpoints on the reference genome for  <dig> svs, and confirmed our predictions. to what extent svs in intronic and intergenic regions contribute to the evolution of the chicken genome or chicken phenotypes remains unclear, especially because the functions of these genomic regions are largely unknown  <cit> . to date, studies involving the detection and exploitation of genetic variation in chicken encompass large svs by means of cnvs but do not include smaller svs. our study reveals that, given their high frequency, these smaller svs will need to be incorporated in genotyping because they might explain phenotypic differences. in addition, our data suggest that structural variation has contributed to genetic differentiation among current domesticated chicken breeds and the red jungle fowl, and might have played a role in chicken genome evolution.

rrl-based approach to sv detection
currently, sequence-based genome-wide surveys of svs involve the preparation of whole genome fragment libraries in combination with paired-end sequencing. such approaches require relatively large investments, particularly if multiple individuals from multiple breeds have to be screened. this study demonstrated the potential of massive parallel paired-end sequencing of rrls constructed from the pooled dna of multiple individuals. svs were predicted based on the read pair information from the paired-end sequenced small insert rrl, which was purposely created for snp detection. the small rrl size allowed for pcr-based confirmation and characterization of the sv at the base pair level of acquired deletions and small insertions with minimal sequencing efforts. revealing inversion and translocation breakpoints is much more laborious due to the limited information rrl approaches provide. we showed that read pair analysis of a paired-end sequenced rrl is already sufficient for obtaining a first glimpse of svs in a particular sequenced species. this rrl based strategy put constraints on the quality of the reference genome because assembly errors will result in false positive sv predictions in reference based detection approaches. uncertainty about the quality of assembly of some of the smaller micro-chromosomes together with computational limits at the time of this study were the reasons why we did not analyze the whole genome for svs. an enhanced assembly of the chicken reference genome and the increasing computational power allow for improvement in the detection of svs using our approach. furthermore the use of multiple rrls including large and small fragments pools, that are separately tagged and paired-end sequenced together in bulk, will considerably improve sv detection at small increase of cost. more demanding is pem of a randomly sheared and size-selected whole genome library providing a more complete catalog of rearrangements characterized between a sample and a reference  <cit> . an even more complete picture including svs of a larger size and more complex rearrangements will require paired-end sequencing of several libraries of different insert sizes  <cit> . the detection of all structural variation, which requires whole genome sequencing and de novo assembly, is extremely demanding. however, the identification of  deletions and insertions with comparable or shorter length than the standard deviation of paired-end insert sizes requires de novo assemblies, because such svs cannot reliably be identified by mapping approaches. moreover, reference-based approaches, included mapping approaches, are biased to the completeness of the reference and, thus, ignore variants in regions that are missing from the reference genome due to structural variation. finally, de novo assembly has the advantage of resolving svs to a single base pair level, and inserted sequences can be obtained  <cit> .

next generation sequencing
we used a ngs approach to identify genomic rearrangements within four commercial chicken breeds by comparing their genomes to the sequenced chicken genome . we excluded several classes of sequence reads from further analysis, including reads that did not show the restriction enzyme tag and those that showed more than one mismatch in the alignment. the first constraint was applied to eliminate false positive insertion predictions due to a breakdown of the rrl resulting in shorter spans of paired-end reads, whereas the second constraint was applied to reduce the number of false predictions due to sequencing errors. however, we realize that by taking these measures we also discard many read pairs because of true nucleotide variation, which occur in one of every  <dig> bp in the chicken  <cit> . the inclusion of read pairs with more than one mismatch in the alignment can be considered but has a risk of falsely predicted svs due to mapping errors, requiring a revalidation of our proposed sv size deviation versus the observed frequency rule . on the other hand, reducing the mapping constraints might reveal additional true svs potentially hidden in the considerable fraction of read pairs with only one end or no end mapped to the reference when using our mapping constraints. however, this fraction of read pairs with mapping problems might also largely represent sequences of gaps in the genome  and, thus, cannot be mapped.

sv distribution across breeds
theoretically, our approach for identifying svs allows the prediction of svs and insight into how a predicted sv is distributed across breeds. we showed that the observed distribution of svs is a good predictor for the actual distribution of the sv in breeds. even with limited sampling, predicted sv distributions correlated with the pcr-based genotyping results of pooled samples . in general, pcr-based genotyping revealed that predicted svs are more widely shared in breeds than predicted by our sequencing-based estimation. this situation is caused by limited sampling, and the reduction of target sequence complexity by creating rrls might have contributed to this difference. our sampling regimen required enzyme recognition sequences flanking a sv within the size range for the rrl to include a particular sv in the rrl. breed-specific snps in alui sites may have caused one or both sv alleles to not be sampled and are, thus, not predicted to be present in that breed, consequently affecting our sequencing-based estimation of sv distribution across breeds. conversely, our pcr-based genotyping approach with pooled samples was not affected by sampling limitation or alui snps and revealed the presence of svs in a breed even at allele frequencies of  <dig>  .

because of the difference in the predicted presence of a sv in a breed and the genotyping results, we realize that the  <dig> svs with which we estimated breed specificity might not be fully representative. the use of different rrl sizes  is reflected in a  <dig> -2-fold difference in the svs detected in broilers and layers. the fairly large percentage of svs shared in broilers can be interpreted as being due to the effects of selection during line development by commercial companies and is consistent with the results of recent snp genotyping  <cit> , but it might be over-estimated in our study due to the difference in rrl construction. the percentage of predicted svs shared by brown egg layers and broiler  <dig>  however, is an indication that these breeds are more genetically related compared to the other breeds. recent snp genotyping results for brown and white egg layers and three broiler lines also indicated that the brown egg layer breed is more closely related to broiler lines than to white egg layers  <cit> , which is in agreement with our conclusion based on sv distribution.

abundance, location, and size of svs in the chicken genome
the reduction in the percentage of the genome covered by sequencing a rrl instead of randomly sampling the whole genome placed high constraints on the detection of svs. the actual amount of svs is likely much higher because we only sampled those that are flanked by restriction sites, and such that the intermediate sequence length of the variant was in the size range of the rrl. large insertions were not expected to be detected because our rrl approach only allows for the detection of up to about  <dig> bp, the size between the maximum rrl fragment size  minus the mapping size of two completely overlapping reads 

although the larger svs are most likely under-represented in our data due to the constraints of the applied detection method, we can conclude that the majority of svs in the chicken genome are smaller than  <dig> kb . this finding is consistent with human studies  <cit>  in which sv abundance inversely correlated with sv size. we observed that 99% of the predicted svs were located in intronic  and intergenic regions , which together comprise ~90% of the chicken genome. as expected, svs were less abundant in coding regions because, like snps, they are more likely to have negative impacts and be eliminated by purifying selection. moreover the observed lower abundance of svs in coding region is consistent with the idea that the most common rearrangement mechanism requires substrates, such as microhomology, low copy repeats, and segmental duplications, which are more abundant in non-coding regions  <cit> . in  <dig> of  <dig> sequenced sv breakpoints, we were able to identify signatures in the dna sequence indicating the mechanism by which svs are formed. all identified signatures involved microhomology at the breakpoint junction that resulted from either nonhomologous end-joining or replication fork stalling and template switching events  <cit> . other svs did not show a clear sequence signature.

CONCLUSIONS
we provided a first glimpse of the abundance and genomic locations of structural variation in the chicken genome by identifying  <dig>  mostly small, rearrangements, some of which were in coding regions, though a majority was located in non-coding regions. based on the present data, we expect to find thousands of small  and hundreds of larger rearrangements in the whole chicken genome, encompassing more nucleotides than snps, and that are putatively involved in phenotypic variation. we observed that structural variation has contributed to genetic differentiation among current domesticated chicken breeds and the red jungle fowl. finally, we showed that little sequencing effort on a reduced representation of a genome is sufficient for the detection and base pair level annotation of a variety of svs in a sequenced genome.
