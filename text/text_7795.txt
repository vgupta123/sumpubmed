BACKGROUND
transposable genetic elements have been known for decades since the pioneering work of barbara mcclintock  <cit> . however, only in recent years, with the aid of novel massive parallel sequencing technologies and computational power, can these elements be more easily identified, classified and studied  <cit> . the largest class of sequences in mammalian genomes is interspersed repetitive elements that can constitute, in some cases, more than 50% of the genome  <cit> . retrotransposons and retrotransposon-like elements , such as retroposons, are the most common repeats. these elements replicate in a manner similar to retroviruses, via dna transcription followed by reverse transcription of their rna intermediate and finally dna integration into the genome  <cit> . the abundance of ruminant-specific repeats, such as bovb, bov-ta, bov-a <dig> and art2a, is negatively correlated with gene density and gc content  <cit> .

most retroposons and rtes were considered non-functional and thus regarded as “junk dna”. at present, after gaining more information and understanding of control mechanisms, there are increasing indications that retroposons can serve different functions in the evolutionary process of exaptation  <cit> . promoters, enhancers, silencers and chromatin modifiers are only part of the growing list of control mechanisms that have been reported to involve these elements  <cit> . genomic repeats are particularly abundant in promoters and cis-regulatory elements, in particular transposable elements, which may serve as a rich source of material for the assembly of and tinkering with eukaryotic gene regulatory systems  <cit> . they may also be involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression  and possibly even in translation regulation  <cit> . a growing body of evidence now indicates a close association of transposable elements with non-coding rnas , which in turn may participate in a wide-range of regulatory functions, as well as be linked to disease  <cit> . by re-wiring regulatory networks, the mobilome  can facilitate the evolution of complex and novel physiological processes involving gene expression on a global scale. an intriguing example for this is the evolution of pregnancy  <cit> .

bov-a <dig> is a retroposon that was first discovered in bovid species and therefore was named after the family bovidae  <cit> . it was later shown to be widely distributed among other ruminant genomes  <cit> . the element is composed of two bov-a monomers which are joined together by a linker sequence, and ends with a n repeat  <cit> . bov-a <dig> is usually categorized as a member of the short interspersed nuclear element  family  <cit> . notably, onami and colleagues proposed that due to the absence of promoter sequences for rna polymerase iii and the homology of its two units to the bov-b long interspersed nuclear element , bov-a <dig> does not belong to a sine family but rather is a kind of retroposon that is transcribed by rna polymerase ii  <cit> . events of sine excision from its location in the genome are extremely rare, thus making it a suitable genetic marker for taxonomy  <cit> . several studies on the distribution of bov-a <dig> in the ruminant genome have been conducted. bov-a <dig>  along with other members of the bov-a sines and bov-b lines, constitutes an important marker in deciphering the evolution and phylogeny of ruminants  <cit> .

bovidae, a family belonging to ungulate ruminants, consists of two subfamilies, bovinae and antilopinae. according to common classifications  <cit> , these subfamilies are, respectively, of eurasian and african origin  <cit> . in total, the family comprises almost  <dig> extant species and more than  <dig> fossil species. however, the phylogenetic relationships and taxonomy of bovidae are still controversial  <cit> . bovidae include the economically most important species to mankind - the cow , which was among the first livestock animals to be domesticated around 9000 b.c.  <cit> , close to the time of the domestication of goats and sheep  <cit> . recently, it was claimed that the former followed the later  <cit> , though the order is still under genomic  <cit>  and archaeological  <cit>  research and debate. due to its importance as the main milk and meat source in the world, the cow was the first livestock mammal whose genome was fully sequenced  <cit> , and efforts are devoted to support annotation of the bovine genome  <cit> .

stemming from a search of differences in key regulatory genes, which might serve as the genetic background for domestication or adaptation to ecological niches, we analyzed the p <dig> promoter sequence of tp <dig>  among others. here, we report on the localization of bov-a <dig> in the promoter region of the tumor suppressor gene tp <dig> in bovidae. this sine was inserted in reverse orientation into the tp <dig> p <dig> promoter of tribes belonging to antilopinae, clearly defining this subfamily from bovinae. the assumed mechanism of insertion was found to involve a palindromic conserved sequence in all antilopinae tribes that we sequenced. surprisingly, in tragelaphini, a tribe belonging to the subfamily bovinae, two bov-a <dig> elements were inserted sequentially, in the original orientation and at a different site located 39 bp downstream to the antilopinae insertion site. this probably occurred due to a second palindromic sequence that carries a mutation specific to spiral-horn antelopes and is absent from the genomes of the rest of the members of the family. in domestic cattle , bov-a <dig> is absent from the tp <dig> p <dig> promoter region, most likely due to a point mutation in the first palindromic entrance site. computational analysis of the ruminants’ tp <dig> p <dig> promoter revealed putative rte-specific transcription factor binding sites  which cause physiological and evolutionary repercussions. we detail the findings and discuss the possible implications to the evolution of and phenotypic differences within the bovidae.

RESULTS
analysis of the tp <dig> p <dig> promoter of bovidae
the p <dig> promoter region of tp <dig> in the bos taurus  genome was determined by transcript and est analysis, and confirmed by alignment to the known tp <dig> p <dig> promoter in humans. the p <dig> promoter of tp <dig> is approximately  <dig>  kb upstream to the tp <dig> transcription start site , which is composed of a  <dig> nucleotide-long non-coding region and most of the wrap <dig> first exon. the sequence of the p <dig> promoter was determined experimentally by pcr amplification, gel electrophoresis and subsequent sequencing. sequence analysis revealed a product  <dig> bp longer than the one found in the cow in all antilopinae tribes analyzed in this study, including: ibex , goat , sheep , wildebeest , addax  and gazelle  . the additional 272 bp segment, which is located approximately 500 bp upstream of the tp <dig> tss, is not indicated in the published genome of sheep, as opposed to the goat genome . bioinformatics analysis identified the same additional 272 bp segment in the same location within the tp <dig> p <dig> promoter of tibetan antelope , a species belonging to the pantholopini tribe . in order to further investigate this evolutionary conservation among tribes belonging to the antilopinae subfamily, we looked into the tp <dig> p <dig> promoter of three additional species of the bovinae subfamily: one belonging to the tragelaphini tribe  and two belonging to the bovini tribe . in the zebu and buffalo, similarly to the cow, the extra  <dig> bp long segment was not found, whereas in the common eland a segment of 522 bp was found in a location 39 bp downstream to the antilopinae entrance site . it appears that the insertion into the tp <dig> p <dig> promoter, in terms of size and location, resulted from two independent and unrelated insertion events which occurred after the split between the two subfamilies : one ancient and common to all seven  antilopinae species, and one unique to the tribe tragelaphini. examination of the same promoter region in the outgroups in this study, two close families of bovidae, cervidae  and girraffidae , revealed no insertion, similar to the condition in bovini .figure  <dig>

characterization of the bov-a <dig> element in the tp <dig> p <dig> promoter of bovidae
the additional 272 bp segment in antilopinae is a sine insertion that was previously designated as bov-a <dig>  <cit> . the insertion site of bov-a <dig>  though different in antilopinae and tragelaphini, was within a line sequence in the tp <dig> p <dig> promoter, approximately 500 bp and 460 bp upstream to the tss, respectively . in all  <dig> bovidae species, representing  <dig> tribes, that were experimentally and computationally explored here , the conserved bov-a <dig> elements were clearly defined. this retroposon element consists of a two bov-a monomers connected by a 27 bp linker, and ends with a repetitive terminator sequence x <dig>  the two bov-a monomers can be distinguished by polymorphisms at specific loci, termed diagnostic sites, as well as different lengths   <cit> . based on the bov-a <dig> components and differences between the bov-a monomers, one can determine that the bov-a <dig> element entered once into the tp <dig> p <dig> promoter of the antilopinae species , in the reverse orientation, whereas two bov-a2’s  adjacent to each other entered the tp <dig> p <dig> promoter of tragelaphini  in the forward orientation .figure  <dig>

in comparison with published data  <cit> , some point mutations were found in the first and second bov-a monomers, the linker and in one instance even in the terminator sequence. the spread of the mutations in the different species and tribes, and their precise locations, are summarized in figure  <dig>  all of the mutations that are seen in the goat are also found in its wild relative the ibex. in gazelles, the same bov-a <dig> mutations also appear, with one exception in the 2nd monomer. in addition, there are  <dig> species-specific mutations, all in the 2nd monomer. the wildebeest shares all its bov-a <dig> mutations with the sheep, although they are from different tribes. as sheep, goat and ibex belong to the same tribe, it was unexpected that the sheep sequence would be more similar to the wildebeest sequence. multiple sequence alignment of the full tp <dig> p <dig> promoter revealed that this finding is indeed valid, since in the whole promoter region the sheep sequence is more similar to the wildebeest . the common eland, a member of the bovinae subfamily, has unique mutations, mainly within the second downstream bov-a <dig> retroposon element , that are not seen in its relatives from antilopinae. this observation strengthens the notion of an independent bov-a <dig> insertion event at the tp <dig> promoter of bovidae .figure  <dig>

palindromes act as recognition sequences for the bov-a <dig> insertion
in all of the studied species belonging to antilopinae, there was one insertion event of the bov-a <dig> element in the exact same location and yet in reverse orientation to the one described in the literature. the element resides between two similar sequences, tcagaaagtgat . the sequence at the 3′ end is probably a result of non-equal homologous recombination during the insertion into the genome  <cit> . when looking broadly at the sequences of the insertion site, an 18 bp palindrome is detected  and its sequence is fully conserved in  <dig> out of  <dig> species of antilopinae. this palindrome will be designated here as pali <dig>  in the domestic cow , a transversion mutation, g to a, at the 14th position of pali <dig> results in a mismatch in base pairing  which in turn can impede the ability of this sequence to form three dimensional hairpin structures due to energetic constraints . surprisingly, another member of the bovini tribe, the water buffalo, which lacks a bov-a <dig> sequence in the tp <dig> p <dig> promoter, has an intact pali <dig> sequence and so its sequence is similar to its far relatives in bovidae and dissimilar from its very close relative the cow. in the common eland, pali <dig> is not mutated, and yet bov-a2s were inserted 39 bp downstream from pali <dig>  at a different palindromic sequence, designated here as pali <dig> . in this species , pali <dig> has one extra nucleotide match due to a species-specific transversion point mutation, a to c, and it lacks the last  <dig> nucleotides, both resulting in a different base-pairing and a more stable palindrome . the bov-a <dig> elements were probably inserted here in two sequential events. in the first event, the insertion occurred following the pali <dig> mutated sequence . in the second event, the insertion occurred following the newly formed pali <dig> sequence that appeared as a consequence of the first event. in both cases, the non-equal homologous recombination resulted in the formation of an additional flanking truncated pali <dig> sequence. in the common eland, the existence of a truncated pali <dig> sequence  further supports the notion of two adjacent bov-a <dig> elements rather than a single bov-a <dig> element. it is interesting to note that in the case of the single antilopinae insertion event, the truncated repeat of pali <dig> is truncated only in its 5′ side. in the case of the common eland, pali <dig> is truncated at both the 5′ and the 3′ sides.figure  <dig>

there is evidence for a second sine insertion event in the addax. a unique polya  is followed by a partial pali <dig> sequence, all located between the third and last agc triplet in the terminator of the first inserted bov-a <dig> .

transcription factor binding site analysis of the tp <dig> p <dig> promoter in bovidae
transcription factor binding site  analysis was performed using the genomatix genome analyzer  matinspector program  <cit> . to this end, the tp <dig> p <dig> promoter was analyzed, including the full cpg island  until  <dig> nucleotides downstream of the tp <dig> tss , covering at least 1270 bp in the case of sine-less animals. raw data for this analysis can be found in additional file 2: figure s <dig>  the analysis focused on tfbs sequences that were newly brought into the promoter region by bov-a <dig>  the antilopinae bov-a <dig> element contains some unique tfbss, such as dinr , znf <dig>  nfκb, nanog, bcl <dig> and stat <dig>  that do not appear outside the bov-a <dig> element in the remaining tp <dig> p <dig> promoter of antilopinae or of other bovini and cervidae members . the first three tfbss  also appear in the bov-a <dig> element of tragelaphini, whereas the last two tfbss  are unique to the sheep and wildebeest. stat <dig> appears in most antilopinae members only in the bov-a <dig> element. only in the addax and gazelle can an additional and conserved stat <dig> tfbs be found near the tp <dig> tss, as appears also in the cervidae and other bovids . smad <dig> appears only in the gazelle bov-a <dig> and not in any other species in the promoter region screened here. in terms of tfbs which are enriched in the bov-a <dig> element, tal <dig> appears twice in the bov-a <dig> single insertion and  <dig> times in the tragelaphini double insertion, and only once in the distal cpg island of all the animals sequenced here.figure  <dig>

discussion
a significant portion of mammalian genomes consists of repetitive dna sequence fragments, such as retroposons in the forms of either short or long interspersed elements . because of the clear presence of an element and the low likelihood of exact parallel insertions or deletions, the retroposon presence or absence is considered to be exceptionally effective for detecting ancestral lineages  <cit> . in the case of bovids, the retroposon bov-a <dig>  a sine which is widely distributed in ruminants’ genomes, is detected and used as a genetic marker for evolutionary classification. it was previously shown that very few insertion events, sometimes even a single event, can be used for classification in this important family in which classification is still under debate  <cit> . additionally, in different organisms different classes of retro-elements show diverse integration site preferences into gene-rich regions  <cit> . the insertion event of a bov-a <dig> element in the tp <dig> p <dig> promoter of bovidae described here questions this general assumption. as we report, at the same exact location in the same family, a point mutation dictates the absence of bov-a <dig> in the domestic cow and thus, when compared with species from other families, can lead to the assumption that the domestic cow is closer to cervidae species which lack bov-a <dig> at this location as well. in the case of tragelaphini, one of bovinae’s tribes, two insertion events were evident yet at a different location from the rest of the family, 39 bp downstream to the common antilopinae insertion site. as will be described shortly, the reason for the different location and double insertion is sequence related and we argue that it is dictated by a single point mutation. point mutations, the simplest genetic alteration, can thus lead to different retroposon dispersal in very close species and can mislead evolutionary scientists that use these single events as genetic markers for phylogenetic analysis.

the insertion event that took place in the antilopinae subfamily is found similarly in all of the explored antilopinae tribes, indicating that this event is very ancient and dates back at least 23mya, to antilopinae pre-speciation time  <cit> . this insertion event in a very important genomic “strategic” point might have had a significant functional value for the first antilopinae representatives that migrated from euro-asia to africa  <cit> . the double insertion events in tragelaphini obviously took place after bov-a <dig> inserted to antilopinae’ tp53p <dig> promoter, around 14mya, as bovini members  lack bov-a <dig> in tp <dig> p <dig> promoter  <cit> . in terms of evolutionary significance, it is interesting to note that a tragelaphini member , which according to the fossil record appeared in africa between  <dig>  mya to  <dig>  mya  <cit> , has two sequential bov-a <dig> elements in the tp <dig> p <dig> promoter. in that sense, the common eland is more similar to its african relatives and neighbors in the savanna, the antilopinae subfamily that have one bov-a <dig> element, rather than to its own euro-asian subfamily relatives that lack it  <cit> . this might be a case of convergent evolution in which species from different subfamilies share a common trait due to similarity in their ecological niche.

the bov-a <dig> element that was found here is mostly very similar to the previously described sequence in the literature  <cit> . the major differences are highlighted in figure  <dig>  when looking into these mutational differences and comparing them to the bov-a <dig> consensus, one can clearly identify  <dig> mutations that are unique to antilopinae ,  <dig> mutations that can separate caprini  and the wildebeest from the antilopinae sequence, and one mutation unique to caprini and the wildebeest. the sheep and wildebeest have  <dig> unique mutations, and the addax and gazelle share one unique mutation. along with the above similarities, each inspected species has its own unique mutations, apart from the ibex and goat which have identical sequences. the tibetan antelope, an endangered species from the tibetan plateau, is gaining scientific and medical attention due to its ability to live in hypoxic conditions and with high levels of ultraviolet radiation  <cit> . while there is some debate over the phylogenetic relationship of tibetan antelopes, our data support the notion that the tibetan antelope is a part of antilopinae and more closely related to caprini  <cit> .

the insertion of bov-a <dig> in unrelated insertion events in antilopinae and tragelaphini was made possible due to short palindromic sequences that can form small stem and loop structures, designated as pali <dig> and pali <dig>  while pali <dig>  the entrance site for the antilopinae bov-a <dig> element in the tp <dig> p <dig> promoter, is highly conserved throughout the subfamily and beyond , in the domestic cow  a g to a transversion mutation occurred and probably interfered with the ability of this palindromic sequence to form a stem and loop structure . this point mutation might be the cause of the absence of bov-a <dig> in the extinct founder of the bovini. as mentioned before, the insertion event in antilopinae probably took place very early during bovidae divergence into two subfamilies. the fact that this mutation occurred only in bovini might have a significant role in this tribe's evolution. in the case of the water buffalo, which also belongs to bovini, the existence of the full pali <dig> is probably due to a later reversal mutation back to the original sequence as it lacks the bov-a <dig> element, like its tribal fellows the cows. the entrance site in tragelaphini is a 16 bp-long palindromic sequence, pali <dig>  this sequence is unique in the common eland and lengthens a shorter and thus less energetically favorable 14 bp palindrome that exists in all bovid species. it is hard to speculate whether bov-a <dig> entered after pali <dig>  39 bp downstream to pali <dig>  because pali <dig> is more “transposon favorable” or that as in the case of the water buffalo its original pali <dig> sequence was mutated  and only later reversed to the more functional one. it was reported earlier that palindromic at rich sequences can be responsible for genome rearrangements  <cit>  and transposon reintegration  <cit> . although the former reported sequences are hundreds of nucleotides in length, and the latter is related to the tol <dig> transposon, these findings support our proposed model, with pali <dig> and pali <dig> being the first reported cases of short palindromic sequences responsible for sine insertion.

another interesting finding, related to the insertion site of these bov-a <dig> elements into the tp <dig> p <dig> promoter, is the mechanism of insertion. it is well known that sine elements need line elements to re-transpose and they do so through an unequal crossing over mechanism  <cit> . in the case of both bov-a <dig> insertions reported here , a partial palindromic sequence was replicated and is evident adjacent to the 3′ end of the bov-a <dig> element. this partially replicated palindromic sequence was sufficient in the case of the common eland to enable a second bov-a <dig> insertion, resulting in two sequential bov-a <dig> elements, rather than bov-a <dig>  <cit> . in the case of the addax, we speculate that the partial pali <dig> followed by a long poly tail is the result of a second unsuccessful sine insertion event  sequence) as poly’s are part of known sine insertion mechanisms into the genome  <cit> . putting together the single insertion event in antilopinae, the dual insertion event in tragelaphini, and the second insertion attempt in the addax  all in the tp <dig> p <dig> promoter, strengthens the hypothesis that this promoter and its short palindromic sequences are hotspots for insertion of genetic elements, which probably provided an evolutionary advantage due to functional significance.

tfbs analysis revealed unique tfbss that exist only in the inserted bov-a <dig> elements and thus might represent a classic case of modified regulation of gene expression which may lead to modified function. the loss of the conserved stat <dig> binding site in the line sequence of antilopinae  and the gain of this same binding site in the bov-a <dig> element in proximity to an nfκb binding site, might be a result of a subfunctionalization-like process. as was mentioned above, in the common eland's tp <dig> promoter, two bov-a <dig> insertion events were obtained, in very close proximity to the antilopinae's bov-a <dig> insertion site. this might be a case of convergent evolution in which african members of bovidae, along with members that live in mountainous rocky regions northern to africa , have a similar genomic alteration. it was shown experimentally that deletion of stat <dig> or its conditional knockout in mice suppresses epithelial apoptosis and dramatically delays mammary gland involution upon forced weaning in mice  <cit> . moreover, stat <dig> along with nfκb signaling pathways are also responsible for inflammatory signaling and acute phase response that are part of later phases of the normal involution process  <cit> , and were shown to be suppressed by sim <dig> which promotes delayed involution  <cit> . tp <dig> itself is induced rapidly following weaning of neonates  <cit> . balb/c-tp <dig> null mice displayed delayed involution of the mammary epithelium  <cit> . tp <dig> is a physiological regulator of mammary involution that acts to rapidly initiate apoptosis in the secretory epithelium  <cit> . the combined loss of tp <dig> and stat <dig> in double knockout mice, led to a severe perturbation in the mammary gland involution, with hyper delayed loss of epithelium and reappearance of adipocytes. in the absence of stat <dig> alone, the apoptotic program can default to a p <dig> pathway  <cit> . activation of nfκb in mammary epithelium promotes milk loss during mammary development  <cit> . in light of these and our tfbs analysis findings, one may propose that not only stat <dig>  nfκb and tp <dig> are involved in the regulation of involution, but also the interplay between these pathways, as the former two tf  regulate tp <dig> transcription during the weaning process.

involution is a complex physiological mechanism, responsible for milk arrest and mammary remodeling upon weaning. involution was vastly explored molecularly due to its importance to female breast health and due to its economic importance to the dairy market  <cit> . although much of our present knowledge of involution, mainly its cellular and underlying molecular mechanism, is based on work with rodents, similarities to dairy animals and studies in bovine explants further support our model. it was shown that in goats and ewes the process of involution has both a similar timeline as well as parallel stages to what is seen in rodents  <cit> . the situation in cows is different as the incidence of apoptosis during tissue remodeling between lactations appears markedly lower  <cit> . mammary involution proceeds with little loss of epithelial cells, and no disengagement of epithelial cells from the basement membrane  <cit> . mammary explants from pregnant dairy cows have the capacity to maintain a population of surviving mammary epithelial cells that remain hormone-responsive, are capable of milk protein gene expression, and maintain alveolar architecture without exposure to exogenous macromolecules during culture  <cit> . this intrinsic capacity was attributed to expression of genes which lead to avoidance of cell death pathways  <cit> . it was proposed that identification of genes that may contribute to cell survival in bovine mammary explants may constitute a significant financial advantage for the dairy industry, due to improved persistence of lactation  <cit> . these observations, in light of our results, raise the possibility that the absence of bov-a <dig> from the tp <dig> p <dig> promoter of bovini domestic species might be the cause for delayed mammary involution.

it is intriguing to speculate that the african savanna and steep high cliff niches demand its herbivores to wean rapidly and return to normal morphology as soon as possible. the strong predation stress in the savanna, and the harsh topography that members of caprini inhabit as compared to the euro/asia bovid habitat, can be strong stressors that favor a shorter involution period. altogether this might explain the ability of our domestic cows and buffalos to bear greater persistency of lactation.

CONCLUSIONS
we report the independent insertions of bov-a <dig> retroposons in the promoter region of tp <dig>  the guardian of the genome, in antilopinae and tragelaphini. whereas these bov-a <dig> insertions differ in the genomic location of insertion site, orientation and number of inserted elements, they share a common feature: the entrance site in both cases employed short palindromes that can form hairpin secondary structures. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report in which short palindromes serve as hot spots for retroposon insertion into the mammalian genome. tfbs analysis of tp <dig> promoter in bovidae revealed that the bov-a <dig> elements harbor unique binding sites for transcription factors that might regulate tp <dig> expression and mammary involution. this in turn may answer the need for rapid mammary involution in bovidae species of the savanna/mountainous regions. the absence of bov-a <dig> in the tp <dig> promoter of domestic bovids might have been the early background for future milk persistency.
