BACKGROUND
disulfide bonds contribute to the stability and function of many extracytoplasmic, soluble or membrane-bound proteins. in gram-negative bacteria, the oxidative protein folding takes place in the periplasm and is controlled by proteins from the dsb family  <cit> . in the highly oxidizing environment of the periplasm, there is also a need for selected proteins to be kept in a reduced form. in the assembly of c-type cytochromes, essential for energy metabolism, for example, the cytochrome c maturation process requires ligation of heme  to reduced thiols of the cys-x-x-cys-his motif of apocytochrome  <cit> . to date, there are two different systems for cytochrome-c biogenesis that have been found in bacteria: system i and system ii. they comprise two kinds of proteins acting in a coordinated fashion: those involved in heme handling and heme ligation to the apocytochrome, and those contributing to reduction of a disulfide bond of the cxxch heme-binding motifs .

the cytochrome-c maturation machinery of the system i operating in many gram-negative bacteria consists of up to ten proteins . the apocytochrome reduction is accomplished by the action of ccmg , ccmh, and dsbd or ccda. dsbd/ccda transfers electrons from cytoplasmic thioredoxin to ccmg. then ccmg is re-oxidized by shuttling its electrons to ccmh, which finally transfers them to apocytochrome c. however, the details concerning mixed disulfide complexes created during the process still remain unclear  <cit> . the remaining proteins play a role in heme transport and its ligation to the apocytochrome  <cit> .

system ii is simpler and more widespread among bacterial species. it is present in, for example, gram-positive bacillus subtilis. it contains four proteins, resa, resb, resc and ccda, of which resa  is a functional counterpart of ccmg, and ccda is a functional counterpart of dsbd. resb  and resc  form a complex to deliver the heme, and they function in the cytochrome c-heme ligation  <cit> . while in most microorganisms, the ccsb and ccsa proteins are present as two separate polypeptides, there are a few species of bacteria, such as wolinella, bacteroides and some strains of helicobacter spp., whose genes encode ccsa and ccsb fused into one large orf   <cit> .

many studies have tried to decipher the cooperation among periplasmic dsb proteins in cytochrome-c biogenesis. initially, it was thought that introduction of the disulfide bonds into the cxxch motif of the apocytochrome c, which happens just after its transport to the periplasm by the sec system, is an obligatory step of the process, as dsba and dsbb mutants in e. coli were unable to produce cytochrome c  <cit> . however, recent data in the literature may contradict this scheme; the lack of the dsb proteins of the oxidative pathway in b. subtilis and r. capsulatus, for example, suppresses the cytochrome c deficiency of ccmg or ccda mutants . however, it should be noted that the dsb oxidative pathway functioning is dependent on cell growth conditions  it has also been demonstrated that the heterologous expression of ccsba of h. pylori or ccsab from b. pertussis, both encoding cytochrome c synthetase, in an e. coli that lacks its own cytochrome c machinery results in c-type cytochrome formation. this observed effect was significantly enhanced by addition of exogenous reductant  <cit> . detailed analysis of the paracoccus denitrificans cytochrome maturation in an e. coli dsba, dsbd double-mutant led mavridou et al. to the conclusion that apocytochrome is subjected to two competing reactions: either heme attachment to its cysteine thiols, or oxidation of those thiols  <cit> .

helicobacter pylori is a gram-negative spiral-shaped bacterium, a member of ε-proteobacteria that specifically colonizes the gastric epithelium of humans with severe consequences. data on h. pylori cytochromes are not comprehensive. analysis of its genome nucleotide sequence revealed that this microaerophilic microorganism possesses a rather simple respiratory chain consisting of three enzymes: quinol-cytochrome c reductase, cytochrome bc <dig> complex, cytochrome c <dig> and cb-type cytochrome c oxidase  <cit> . further inspection of the h. pylori genome showed the existence of a second gene encoding a putative low molecular mass cytochrome c  named cycb. both cyca and cycb are essential genes and cannot substitute for each other  <cit> . cytochrome c <dig>  encoded by the cyca  gene, is a soluble periplasmic protein, a potential electron donor to the cb-type cytochrome c oxidase  <cit> . to our knowledge, little is known about the c-type cytochrome maturation system of helicobacter pylori. in the genome of h. pylori  <dig>  there are  <dig> proteins containing cxxc motifs characteristic of thiol:disulfide oxidoreductases identified to date. only two of these proteins have a thioredoxin-like  fold  and are periplasm-located  <cit> . this microorganism uses system ii, and hp <dig>  and hp <dig> , a homolog of resbc), whose products potentially play a central role in c-type cytochrome maturation, constitute one transcriptional unit  <cit> . hp <dig> can, to some extent, complement for a lack of the e. coli cytochrome-c maturation machinery. the recently determined crystal structure of hp <dig> shows similarity to the structure of b. subtilis resa. however large structural differences between these two proteins were also observed  <cit> . we have previously demonstrated that hp <dig> is a dimeric oxidoreductase that catalyzes disulfide bond formation in the periplasm. in this work, to gain further insight into the helicobacter pylori dsb protein network, we analyzed hp <dig>  the second periplasmic oxidoreductase, using biochemical and genetic tools.

RESULTS
determination of the in vivo redox state of hp0377
hp <dig> is an oxidoreductase, as it contains the trx domain with a cxxc  motif located at the n-terminus of the first helix in the trx fold. the involvement of hp <dig> in the cytochrome c maturation process is indicated by its structure, its in vitro interaction with hp <dig>  and the genetic organization of the dna fragment containing the hp <dig> gene  <cit> .

to clearly define whether hp <dig> functions in the oxidizing pathway or the reducing pathway, we first decided to determine the redox state of that protein in vivo using the ams-trapping technique  <cit> . the in vivo redox state of an oxidoreductase usually reflects its activity in the cell, i.e., proteins that function in the oxidizing pathway, such as ecdsba, are maintained in the oxidized state in vivo, whereas proteins that function in the reducing pathway, such as ccmg, are maintained predominantly in the reduced state. we found that hp <dig> is present in the reduced form in wild-type cells, which suggests that hp <dig> functions as a reductase in h. pylori, which is in accord with its three dimensional structure  <cit> .

thus, we also determined the redox status of the hp <dig> in h. pylori lacking hp <dig> or dsbi . both proteins are active in the dsb oxidative pathway. as described earlier, hp <dig> introduces disulfide bonds and dsbi is partially responsible for hp <dig> re-oxidation  <cit> . our results showed that a significant portion of hp <dig> is present in the oxidized form in both the hp <dig> and dsbi mutated cells . also the overproduction of hp <dig> or dsbi from a moderate copy number plasmid disturbs the redox homeostasis and results in the presence of hp <dig> in both reduced and oxidized forms . to clarify the link between hp <dig> and cytochrome c biogenesis, we decided to check whether apocytochrome c is a substrate of hp <dig>  we found that hp <dig> was able to oxidize the reduced apocytochrome c in vitro fig.  <dig> redox state of hp <dig> in wt and mutants: hp0231::cat, dsbi::aph and complemented strains of h. pylori strain n <dig>  bacterial cultures were treated with 10 % tca, followed by alkylation with ams. cellular proteins including the reduced  and the oxidized  controls were separated by 14 % sds-page under non-reducing conditions, and western blot analysis antibodies against hp <dig> was performed. each lane contains proteins isolated from the same amount of bacteria

.

biochemical characterization of hp0377
to clearly define whether hp <dig> functions as oxidoreductase, we analyzed the biochemical properties of the protein. recombinant proteins used for biochemical analysis were produced as cytoplasmic proteins in e. coli cells and purified by affinity chromatography. first, to gain insight into the role played by hp <dig>  we determined its redox potential by equilibrium incubation using gsh/gssg as a reference. we found that the hp <dig> redox potential is –  <dig> mv , which makes it a rather weak reductant.

next we determined the ability of hp <dig> to reduce insulin in the presence of dtt. the insulin reduction assay is commonly used to determine whether a protein can function as an oxidoreductase, regardless of its function in the reducing or the oxidizing pathway in vivo. insulin contains two intramolecular disulfide bonds that connect the a and b chains: reduction of these disulfide bonds causes the precipitation of the b chain, which can be monitored by following the increase of turbidity at  <dig> nm  <cit> . as shown in additional file 2: figure s <dig>  the reaction lag time with hp <dig> in the insulin reduction assay is almost as long as the control reaction , whereas the lag time with ecdsba is  <dig> min. therefore, hp <dig> likely cooperates with a specific substrate, which is typical of ccmg proteins. however, these data are in contrast to some previous data  <cit> . to clarify this inconsistency, and because there is a similarity between the active site of hp <dig>  and the disulfide isomerase ecdsbc , we performed a disulfide isomerase assay by evaluating the ability of hp <dig> to reactivate oxidized, scrambled rnase . scrnase was prepared as described in the methods section and did not contain free cysteines, as confirmed with ellman reagent. in this assay, the refolding efficiency of hp <dig> was almost as high as ecdsbc . to get a complete biochemical characterization of hp <dig>  we also investigated its ability to catalyze the refolding of reduced-unfolded rnasea. as expected, hp <dig> did not show activity in this assay . as hp <dig> revealed high isomerizing activity, and because dsb proteins involved in the isomerization pathway exist as dimers, we also evaluated the potential oligomerization of hp <dig> using two methods   hp <dig> that lacked its own signal sequence  and contained a c-terminal  <dig> his tag was purified from e. coli cytoplasm and used in both assays. we found that exposure of hp <dig> to glutaraldehyde, which stabilizes oligomeric proteins by covalent crosslink formation, resulted in generation of a protein with a molecular weight of  <dig> kda. this result clearly showed that hp <dig> can exist as a dimer. the size exclusion experiment showed that hp <dig> eluted as two peaks, one with an estimated mass of  <dig> kda, consistent with the size of the monomer, and the second with estimated mass of  <dig> kda, consistent with the size of the homodimer. thus, the presented data allowed us to conclude that at least a portion of hp <dig> exists as a dimer.fig.  <dig> isomerase activity assay. the reaction contained  <dig> μm scrambled rnase in  <dig> mm potassium phosphate buffer, ph  <dig> , 2 mm edta,  <dig> μm dtt, and 9 mm ccmp. the reaction was performed in the absence or presence of  <dig> μm ecdsbc,  <dig> μm hp <dig>  the cleavage of ccmp by refolded rnase was monitored continuously at  <dig> nm. the changes in the absorbance at  <dig> nm as a function of time are presented. three independent experiments were performed

the function of thiol-oxidoreductases depends on the pka values of their active-site cys residues. the pka of the hp <dig> active site thiols was determined by observing the change in absorption of the thiolate anion at  <dig> nm as a function of ph in wt protein. the ph titration of wt hp <dig> showed two transitions, one with pka =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and the other with pka =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  fig. 6a. because these data are atypical for ccmgs, we constructed two single-cys cxxc motif mutants of hp <dig> , which allowed independent measurement of the pka of each cys residue. as shown in fig. 6b, c the c89s mutant had a pka =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and the c92s mutant a pka =  <dig>  ±  <dig> . these results agreed with the titrations of the wt protein. the pka value of the solvent-exposed active site cysteine  is about  <dig> . this is relatively acidic compared with the solvent-exposed active site cysteine of the e. coli ccmg protein, pka =  <dig>   <cit> , or the b. subtilis resa, pka =  <dig>   <cit> ; it is as acidic as e. coli dsba, which is a known oxidant whose pka of the solvent-exposed active site cysteine is  <dig>   <cit> , and it is close to the pka of ecdsbc,  <dig>  ±  <dig>   <cit> . thus, hp <dig> is the first described ccmg protein having an acidic pka of the n-terminal cysteine of the cxxc motif, and at the same time, it presents a low redox potential.fig.  <dig> thiol ionization equilibrium in hp <dig> followed by uv absorbance at  <dig> nm. panel a: hp <dig> wild type. panel b: hp <dig> c89s. panel c: hp <dig> c92s



hp <dig> is an essential protein for h. pylori
to investigate the function of hp <dig> in h. pylori we decided to construct an isogenic hp <dig> knock-out strain by allelic exchange. initial attempts to knock out hp <dig> using kanamycin or chloramphenicol antibiotic cassettes and the allelic exchange methodology failed. several laboratories have reported that loss of active ccmg can be compensated by the addition of reducing agents to the growth medium. therefore, we tested whether the addition of the dtt into growth medium enable us to obtain an h. pylori n6/ <dig> hp <dig> mutated strain. it did not. moreover, our attempts at trans-complementation of a genomic deletion with a plasmid-borne copy of hp <dig>  based on the strategy using modified phel <dig> complementing plasmids of low and high copy number described by boneca et al. were also unsuccessful  <cit> .

taken together, these studies, in combination with our observation that a h. pylori hp <dig> mutated strain can only be generated in the presence of a reducing agent, suggest that both hp <dig> and hp <dig> provide an essential function in h. pylori.

hp <dig> is a redox partner of hp0377
dsb proteins that play a role in a cytochrome-c biogenesis, in both system i and system ii, are kept in the reduced form by the integral membrane protein dsbd, or its shortened analogue ccda. both proteins catalyze the transfer of electrons from cytoplasmic thioredoxin across the inner membrane to the periplasm; however the mechanism of the process in the case of ccda is still unknown  <cit> . apart from hp <dig>  which was described as ccda, a search for dsb homologs in the h. pylori genome, employing the e. coli dsb sequence as a query sequence, revealed that h. pylori contains another dsbd homolog . similar to rodobacter capsulatus ccda and bacillus subtilis ccda, hp <dig> is a six-transmembrane  protein containing two cysteines at the end of the first and the fourth tm segments  <cit> . hp <dig>  however, has five cysteines with an unusual, and as yet uncharacterized, spatial arrangement, and it could be involved in a process other than the cytochrome c biogenesis. thus, to establish whether hp <dig> is responsible for re-reducing hp <dig>  we created a h. pylori strain lacking hp <dig>  the recombinant plasmid puwm <dig>  was used for the mutagenesis. the plasmid contains the hp <dig> gene disrupted by insertion of a kanamycin resistance cassette into the gene coding sequence. the hp <dig> mutants were only produced in the presence of the reducing agent dtt, which indicates the importance of hp <dig> and its reducing activity for bacterial survival. we then tested whether deletion of hp <dig> affects the redox state of hp <dig>  we noticed that growth of the hp <dig> mutated strain without dtt was much slower than growth of the wt strain . therefore, to check the influence of hp <dig> on the hp <dig> redox state, the h. pylori n <dig> hp0265− strain was cultivated  <dig> h longer than the wt strain to achieve the same cell density. as shown in fig. 8a, the knock-out of hp <dig> results in the accumulation of a noticeable amount of hp <dig> in the oxidized state, which indicates the role of hp <dig> in re-reducing hp <dig>  the addition of dtt to the medium resulted in the presence of hp <dig> in the reduced form, clearly verifying the role of hp <dig> .fig.  <dig> effect of dtt on helicobacter pylori hp0265

localization of hp0377
most of the ccmg proteins are membrane-anchored via the n-terminal transmembrane domain. in silico analysis  did not indicate the presence of the transmembrane n-terminal domain in hp <dig>  though it confirmed the occurrence of this kind of domain located in the n-terminus of b. subtilis resa. at the same time, in silico analysis using the lipop  <dig>  server showed that the hp <dig> amino-acid sequence contains a putative signal sequence that can be processed by signal peptidase ii, which suggested that hp <dig> is an inner membrane lipoprotein. to confirm the predicted localization of hp <dig> in h. pylori, a subcellular fractionation experiment was carried out. detection of hp <dig> with specific rabbit antibody against rhp <dig> revealed that hp <dig> is present in the inner membrane proteins compartment . as a control for the method of subcellular fractionation of h. pylori used, we traced the cellular location of dsbi , which is an inner-membrane protein .fig.  <dig> localization of hp <dig>  panel a: immunoblot analysis with subcellular fractions of h. pylori strain  <dig> using anti-hp <dig> antibody. lanes:  <dig> - whole cell lysate;  <dig> - periplasmic proteins;  <dig> - protein ladder;  <dig> - cytoplasmic proteins,  <dig> - inner membrane proteins;  <dig> - outer membrane proteins;  <dig> - membranes protein. panel b: immunoblot analysis with subcellular fractions of h. pylori strain  <dig> using anti-dsbi antibody. lanes:  <dig> - whole cell lysate;  <dig> - periplasmic proteins;  <dig> - protein ladder;  <dig> - inner membrane proteins;  <dig> - outer membrane proteins;  <dig> - membrane proteins,  <dig> - cytoplasmic proteins



hp <dig> contains an lsac motif located in the c-terminal of its potential signal sequence. it has been shown that the two main strategies commonly used to confirm lipid modification of a protein  have not worked in h. pylori  <cit> . thus, to provide further insight into the role of lsac motif of hp <dig>  we carried out alanine mutagenesis of c <dig>  a gene encoding the c25a mutated protein was cloned into phel <dig> and introduced into h. pylori n <dig>  in this experiment, we used the wt strain as we had not been able to generate a knock-out of hp <dig>  we expected that the mutated form of the hp <dig> , overexpressed from the plasmid, would locate in the periplasm or cytoplasm. we found that the overexpression of hp <dig> had no effect on cell growth and that the changing c <dig> into a in the lsac motif of hp <dig> did not influence its anchoring to the cytoplasmic membrane .

hp <dig> is not active in e. coli cells
to test whether it would be possible to study hp <dig> activity in e. coli cells, the hp <dig> gene was cloned with its own promoter into a shuttle plasmid, phel <dig> , and introduced by transformation into wild-type e. coli, and into e. coli dsba and e. coli dsbc mutated cells. the presence of hp <dig> protein expressed from recombinant plasmid in e. coli cells was confirmed by western blot analysis using specific rabbit anti-hp <dig> serum . we found that hp <dig> does not restore the dsba wild type phenotype, as measured by motility and dtt tests, as well as by the alkaline phosphatase assay . moreover, hp <dig> is not able to complement the e. colidsbc mutant, as measured by the copper sensitivity assay .

to clarify the lack of complementation of the ecdsbc mutation by hp <dig>  we determined its redox state in e. coli cells. in both the e. coli wild type and in dsbd mutated cells, hp <dig> exists in an oxidized form, in contrast to what was observed in h. pylori, where it was present in a reduced form . these results suggest that hp <dig> does not cooperate with e. coli dsbd.fig.  <dig> redox state of hp <dig> in wt and dsbd mutant e. coli strain transformed with puwm <dig> carrying hp <dig>  bacterial cultures were treated with 10 % tca, followed by alkylation with ams. cellular proteins including the reduced  and the oxidized  controls were separated by 14 % sds-page under non-reducing conditions, and western blot analysis using antibodies against hp <dig> was performed. each lane contains proteins isolated from the same amount of bacteria



the h. pylori genome does not contain a dsbd gene, and hp <dig> is reduced by ccda . thus, to start analysis of the hp <dig> function in an e. coli background, we attempted to introduce hp <dig> into e. coli. we cloned hp <dig> into the low copy number plasmid pmpm-k6Ω, which has an arabinose inducible promoter. after the correctness of the recombinant plasmid construction was verified by sequencing, the plasmid was introduced by transformation into wt e. coli and a dsbd mutant e. coli that harbored a plasmid expressing hp <dig>  when the expression of hp <dig> was induced by  <dig>  % arabinose, the production of hp <dig> was lethal for cells .

discussion
hp <dig> is a thioredoxin-fold protein containing the csyc motif, which indicates that it functions as a disulfide oxidoreductase. although there is no evidence that hp <dig> is involved in cytochrome c assembly in vivo, that is the likely case because its resolved structure is similar to that of other ccmg proteins, and because it is able to reduce the oxidized form of apocytochrome c in vitro  <cit> . additionally, it is co-transcribed with the ccsba  gene that is involved in heme transport and its ligation to apocytochrome c  <cit> . in this work we have showed that hp <dig> is present in vivo in the reduced form, which is a characteristic feature of thiol oxidoreductases being reductants. the hp <dig> redox state in vivo is consistent with its redox potential determined by us  and by others , which classifies hp <dig> as a mild reductant. this value is in good accord with the standard redox potential determined for the most gram-negative ccmg proteins, such as ecccmg , bjccmg  or paccmg  . additionally, we have shown that hp <dig>  like other ccmgs, does not reduce insulin. this finding is consistent with a generally accepted view that ccmg proteins are specific thiol-oxidoreductases involved in only the cytochrome c maturation pathway. so far, the only known exception to this rule is tlpa from b. japonicum. this protein is a reductant for the copper metallochapherone scol, but it also acts in the cytochrome maturation process and catalyzes the insulin reduction  <cit> . the tlpa structure, when compared to other ccmgs, revealed some unusual properties that potentially substantiate its activity in the insulin reduction assay  <cit> . although hp <dig> is inactive in the insulin reduction assay, it confers a disulfide isomerase activity almost as high as that of ecdsbc. this atypical hp <dig> attribute is in accord with its capability to generate a dimeric form, as shown by size exclusion and glutaradehyde crosslinking methods. it should be noted, in contrast to our data, that yoon et al. reported that hp <dig> is monomeric. as we and yoon et al. used almost identical recombinant hp <dig> proteins, the inconsistency may result from various experimental methods employed  <cit> . furthermore, the pka of the n-terminal cysteine of the cxxc motif of hp <dig> appears to be similar to those observed for ecdsbc or ecdsba but not to those determined for most ccmgs. this observation suggests that the activity of hp <dig> in h. pylori, which possesses only two proteins having a trx fold with the cxxc motif , is distinct from that described for the classical ccmgs. taking into account that there is no classical dsbc protein in the h. pylori proteome and the dimeric hp <dig> does not catalyze the recovery of active rnase from scrambled rnase , we concluded that hp <dig>  in contrast to most ccmgs that are involved in only the cytochrome c biogenesis process, is at least a bifunctional reductase. figure  <dig> presents a model of hp <dig> functioning. as the gel filtration experiment indicated that hp <dig> exists as a mixture of monomeric and dimeric forms, its dual function may be regulated by the mutual ratio between the two forms. this suggestion is also supported by our interesting finding that hp <dig> is essential for cell viability. additionally, the in vivo experiments provide some intriguing data. we have noticed that the in vivo redox state of hp <dig> is conditioned by the presence of hp <dig> or hp <dig>  previous experiments on the function of hp <dig> showed that it is a periplasmic oxidase, and that hp <dig> is partially responsible for hp <dig> reoxidation. therefore, they create a redox pair playing a role in introduction of disulfide bonds  <cit> . as h. pylori does not encode a classical dsba, hp <dig> may oxidize apocytochrome c just after its transport across the inner membrane. by analogy to the function of b. subtilis resa, we suggest that lack of oxidized apocytochrome c in hp <dig> mutated cells prevents hp <dig> from reacting with its redox partner , so a part of hp <dig> remains in the oxidized form  <cit> . however this hypothesis requires verification because hp <dig>  as indicated by biochemical characterization, may also play a role in processes other than the cytochrome c maturation process. overproduction of the periplasmic thiol oxidases, hp <dig> and hp <dig>  results in changes to the mutual ratio of the reduced and oxidized forms of hp <dig>  as in the hp <dig> mutated cells, only part of hp <dig> is present in a reduced form. since the presence of this form is necessary for hp <dig> to fulfill its function, we decided to compare the cytochrome c activity in hp <dig> mutated cells to that observed in wt cells, using the tmpd-oxidation assay. tmpd  is an artificial substrate of cytochrome c oxidase  <cit> . we did not observe any differences in bacterial cell pigmentation , indicating that when the main periplasmic oxidase, i.e., hp <dig>  is absent, full hp <dig> activity is probably dispensable for cytochrome c biogenesis.fig.  <dig> models representing the role of h. pylori hp <dig> in cytochrome c biogenesis and in oxidized protein folding. following synthesis, apocytochrome c is translocated across the membrane by the sec protein complex, and there it is oxidized by hp <dig> . subsequently, its cxxch motif is reduced by hp <dig>  and it is ligated to heme. likely, as observed for other microorganisms, some molecules of the apocytochrome c are not oxidized and are directly ligated with heme . lack of hp <dig> prevents hp <dig> reduction by hp <dig>  a small portion of hp <dig> is present in a dimeric form and potentially plays a role in the dsb isomerization/reduction pathway. so far, the substrates of this pathway remains unknown



most of the gram-negative bacteria ccmgs are membrane-anchored, periplasm-facing proteins  <cit> . we also tested the subcellular localization of hp <dig> by cell fractionation experiments, which showed that it is present in the inner membrane proteins fraction. these data contradict those of yoon et al., who classified hp <dig> as periplasmic protein  <cit> . hp <dig> contains a putative signal sequence with a lipobox  that can potentially be processed by signal peptidase ii, which is specific for lipoprotein precursors  <cit> . it has been shown that a lipoprotein signal peptidase gene  is present in the h. pylori genome and that it is essential for this bacterium  <cit> . however current knowledge about the mechanism for lipoproteins transport across the inner membrane and their sorting in h. pylori is still limited and comes mainly from bioinformatic studies  <cit> . we hypothesize that hp <dig> is a lipoprotein similar to two well-characterized h. pylori lipoproteins, lpp <dig> and hpaa, which also contain a lipobox  and show inhibited processing, at least when expressed in e. coli cells, by a globomicin, a cyclic peptide antibiotic specific for signal peptidase ii  <cit> . unexpectedly, changing the c of the lsac hp <dig> motif into a did not influence its cell localization. understanding the role of the hp <dig> lipobox requires more investigation, as has been done for some legionella lipoproteins  <cit> .

ccmg proteins that play a role in a cytochrome c biogenesis, in both system i and system ii, are kept in the reduced form by the integral membrane protein dsbd or its shorter analogue, ccda. both proteins catalyze the transfer of electrons from cytoplasmic thioredoxin across the inner membrane to the periplasm. dsbd consists of eight transmembrane segments , an n-terminal  and a c-terminal domain . both the n- and c-terminal domains face the periplasm  <cit> . ccda, which is a shorter version of dsbd, consist of only the β transmembrane domain of dsbd. in contrast to dsbd, which transfers reducing potential to a large number of periplasmic proteins, ccda was thought to be only involved in the cytochrome c maturation process  <cit> . however, recently published data, have showed that in bacillus subtilis or b. anthracis ccda plays a role also in sporulation and virulence  <cit> . recently a new class of dsbd proteins, named scsb – which have a domain organization similar to but not identical with that of dsbd – has been described. however, their role in ccmg re-reduction has not yet been analyzed  <cit> . we show that hp <dig> is kept in the reduced form by hp <dig> and does not cooperate with e. coli ecdsbd. in contrast to our data, it was demonstrated by katzen et al. that ccda from rhodobacter capsulatus complements an e. coli dsbd gene deletion, and ecdsbd complements the lack of rcccda  <cit> . however, r. capsulatus is different from h. pylori and b. subtillius, in that it has a ccda and an scsb. in the publication that describes the e. coli dsbd that reduces r. capsulatus ccmg in the absence of its ccda, the authors failed to knock out the scsb  <cit> . due to the structural resemblance, it is possible that scsb complements the absence of ccda. hence, the conclusion that e. coli dsbd transfers electrons to the r. capsulatus ccmg might have been misleading. the two conserved cysteine residues of ccda are membrane-embedded, and ccda lacks the corresponding alpha and gamma domains of dsbd. the mechanism of transmembrane electron transfer by ccda is still inexplicable. it is likely that it adopts an hourglass-like structure, similar to the dsb β domain, that allows it to interact with cytoplasmic thioredoxin and its periplasmic partners  <cit> . we suggest that any dsbd can only transfer electrons in a proteome that has either a dsbd or a scsb, but not in a proteome that has only a ccda. the effective transmembrane electron transfer is also determined by the structure of the proteins that are substrates of the envelope dsbd or dsbd–like proteins. the best example is the legionella pneumophila dsb system. this bacterium produces two dsba-like proteins , two dsbbs and two dsbds. the dsbd-like proteins differ in their structure: lpdsbd <dig> resembles ecdsbd, whereas lpdsbd <dig> lacks the α domain present in ecdsbd. lpdsba <dig>  the bifunctional protein acting as an oxidase and isomerase, interacts with both lpdsbds and also with ecdsbd, whereas ecdsbc is not reduced by lpdsbd <dig> or by lpdsbd <dig>  <cit> . therefore, e. coli dsbd reduces bordetella ccmg, and not hp <dig>  because the bordetella genome encodes a dsbd, while the h. pylori proteome has a ccda but no dsbd/scsb  <cit> . similarly, b. subtilis has a ccda but no dsbd/scsb, and therefore e. coli dsbd will not reduce its ccmg.

CONCLUSIONS
the fact that h. pylori contains only two classical dsb proteins, and at the same time, its genome encodes many proteins containing consecutive and nonconsecutive disulfide bonds, implies the presence of an atypical dsb protein network. the experimental results presented strongly suggest that hp <dig>  despite a structural similarity to other ccmgs, functions differently from them. biochemical analysis leads us to conclude that hp <dig> is a multifunctional protein. as h. pylori possesses several proteins containing nonconsecutive disulfide bonds, we postulate that the activity of hp <dig> complements the lack of a classical dsbc. also, analysis of the hp <dig> redox state in wt or dsb mutant h. pylori cells supports this assumption, as it indicates cooperation between the dimeric oxidoreductase hp <dig> and hp <dig>  however, further biochemical or structural experiments are required to confirm the nature of potential interaction between hp <dig> and hp <dig>  and to identify substrates of hp <dig>  if any.
