BACKGROUND
leishmaniasis is associated with high morbidity but low mortality. it is a poverty-related disease and has become a serious impediment to socioeconomic development. the true burden of this illness remains unclear because the notification of the disease is compulsory in only  <dig> of the  <dig> affected countries, and most of the affected people live in remote areas. additionally, the disfiguring scars caused by leishmania keep patients hidden. an estimated  <dig>  million new cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis and  <dig>  cases of visceral leishmaniasis occur annually, with approximately  <dig> million people currently infected  <cit> . moreover, cases of leishmania and human immunodeficiency virus co-infection are becoming more frequent  <cit> .

leishmania  amazonensis infection results in diverse clinical manifestations, ranging from cutaneous to mucocutaneous or visceral involvement  <cit> . this is attributable to the genetic diversity of l. amazonensis strains, and this divergence extends to variations of chromosome size  <cit> .

the arsenal of drugs available for treating leishmania infections is limited. the basic treatment consists of administering pentavalent antimonial compounds  <cit> . however, the choice of medication depends on the species involved and type of clinical manifestation  <cit> . the usefulness of antileishmanial drugs has been limited by their toxicity, and treatment failure is often attributable to drug resistance  <cit> . to solve this problem, developing less toxic drugs and discovering cellular and molecular markers in parasites to identify the phenotype of chemoresistance against leishmanicidal drugs are necessary  <cit> . these problems led to the development of additional antileishmanial drugs. some drug-delivery systems, plants, and synthetic compounds are being developed as effective treatments for the disease  <cit> .

previous studies demonstrated the in vitro activity of parthenolide, a sesquiterpene lactone purified from tanacetum parthenium, against promastigotes and intracellular amastigotes  of l. amazonensis <cit> . moreover, significant alterations in promastigote forms were demonstrated by light microscopy and scanning and transmission electron microscopy  <cit> .

we evaluated the activity of parthenolide against l. amazonensis axenic amastigotes and demonstrated a possible mechanism of action of this compound in this life stage of the parasite.

RESULTS
antileishmanial assays
the addition of  <dig>  μm parthenolide to the culture of axenic amastigotes induced growth arrest and partial cell lysis after 48 h . when the cells were treated with  <dig>  μm parthenolide, the percentage of growth inhibition was approximately 70%. parthenolide had an ic <dig> of  <dig>  μm and ic <dig> of  <dig>  μm after 72 h incubation .

a concentration of  <dig>  or  <dig>  μm of the reference drug amphotericin b inhibited more than 93% of l. amazonensis amastigote cell growth. this drug had an ic <dig> and ic <dig> of  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  μm, respectively, after culturing for 72 h .

parthenolide also inhibited the growth of intracellular amastigotes in mouse resident peritoneal macrophages after 24 h incubation. treatment with  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  μm parthenolide reduced the proliferation of parasites into macrophages  by  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> %, respectively, compared with the control. the survival index indicated that parthenolide inhibited the intracellular viability and multiplication of leishmania in infected murine macrophages and showed 50% inhibition of cell survival at a concentration of  <dig>  μm .

previous studies showed that when j774g <dig> murine macrophages were treated with parthenolide, the 50% cytotoxic concentration  was  <dig>  μm  <cit> . by comparing the toxicity for j774g <dig> macrophages and activity against intracellular amastigotes, obtaining the selectivity index ratio is possible . in the present study, parthenolide had an ic <dig> of  <dig>  μm, presenting a selectivity index ratio of  <dig>  .

mutagenicity evaluation
the results of the in vivo bone marrow micronucleus test in rats are shown in table  <dig>  parthenolide did not induce genotoxic effects at a concentration of  <dig>  mg/kg body weight, with no significant increase in the frequency of mnpce  compared with the vehicle control group . in contrast, a significant increase in the frequency of mnpce was observed in the positive control group . in the present study, no clinical signs of toxicity were observed in treated animals. however, further studies should be performed with higher concentrations of parthenolide to exclude the possibility of genotoxicity.

scanning and transmission electron microscopy
to determine the morphological and ultrastructural changes in l. amazonensis axenic amastigotes induced by parthenolide, the cells were treated with the ic <dig>  of the compound. untreated controls showed no morphological  or ultrastructural  differences. similarly, cells incubated with  <dig> % dmso  remained unaltered . when treated with parthenolide, changes in form were visualized by scanning electron microscopy . transmission electron microscopy showed a loss of membrane integrity associated with amphotericin b exposure at the ic <dig> concentration . parthenolide caused intense swelling of the mitochondrion  and cytoplasmic blebbing . finally, the ultrastructural analysis showed that amastigotes treated with parthenolide formed multiple cytoplasmic vacuoles , and intense exocytic activity was observed in the region of the flagellar pocket, appearing as concentric membranes within the pocket .

labeling of autophagic vacuoles with monodansylcadaverine
we studied the incorporation of monodancylcadaverine  in cells in which autophagy was stimulated by parthenolide. axenic amastigotes treated with the ic <dig>  or ic <dig>  of parthenolide showed an increase in the number of vesicles, indicating that the compound induced the formation of mdc-labeled vacuoles in the cytoplasm. mdc-positive cells were visualized in treated cells but not in control cells  or amphotericin-treated cells . these results show that parthenolide treatment, unlike amphotericin b, led to the formation of autophagic vacuoles in l. amazonensis amastigotes.

flow cytometric measurement of amastigote culture
live l. amazonensis cells were incubated with propidium iodide and rhodamine  <dig>  and fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry. the gated percentage of propidium iodide-stained amastigotes after treatment with amphotericin b  was  <dig> %, much higher than untreated parasites  that presented  <dig> % . when the cells were treated with  <dig> and 40 μm parthenolide, the percentages of labeled amastigotes were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively , possibly indicating a considerable increase in plasma membrane permeability. to prove that leishmania cells functionally respond to the pharmacological alteration of ΔΨm, amastigotes were treated with the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone , which has been shown to interfere with mitochondrial membrane potential in various cell types  <cit> . the results showed that  <dig> % of the amastigotes without treatment  presented a maximal increase in fluorescence, and with 200 μm cccp,  <dig> % showed fluorescence, indicating a loss of ΔΨm . we next observed ΔΨm reductions of  <dig> % and  <dig> % when the amastigotes were treated with  <dig> and 40 μm parthenolide, respectively, suggesting that this compound interferes with the mitochondrial membrane potential leading to alteration of atp generation and in consequence cell damage takes place.

epr spectra of spin-labeled leishmania
the experimental and best-fit epr spectra of spin-label 5-dsa structured in the plasma membrane of leishmania are shown in figure  <dig>  these epr spectra are typical for cellular membranes that contain an appreciable amount of integral proteins. treatment with parthenolide increased two epr parameters, the outer hyperfine splitting, 2a//, and rotational correlation time, τ
c
, indicating a significant reduction of membrane lipid dynamics. 2a//is a practice parameter measured directly in epr spectra that has been widely used to monitor membrane fluidity, although in principle it is a static parameter associated with the orientation distribution of the spin labels in the membrane. the theoretical epr spectrum of spin-label 5-dsa in the plasma membrane of leishmania was best fitted using a model of two spectral components. this indicates that the membrane has two populations of spin labels of distinct mobility. the epr spectra of spin labels in lipid bilayers are well known to contain proteins sometimes composed of two spectral components. the more restricted component is associated with boundary lipids where the spin labels surround the hydrophobic regions of proteins, whereas the more mobile component arises from the spin labels located in the bulk bilayer phase, away from the protein  <cit> . the fitting program provides the τ

discussion
for many years, parasites of the genus leishmania have displayed extraordinary plasticity to face modifications in their environment  <cit> . the expansion of risk factors related to environmental changes and man-made transformations are making leishmaniasis a growing public health concern in many countries worldwide  <cit> . leishmaniasis urgently needs novel drugs with improved features, and many compounds primarily derived from plants are promising leads for the development of novel chemotherapeutics  <cit> .

the development of axenic cultures of amastigotes of leishmania species yielded new opportunities to investigate the antileishmanial activities of new compounds directly at the mammalian stage of the parasite  <cit> . assays that use intracellular amastigote cell cultures are relevant because this life cycle stage of the parasite is important to its pathogenicity, and data obtained exclusively from promastigote cell lines are insufficient  <cit> . therefore, in the present study, we determined the leishmanicidal activity of parthenolide, which is naturally occurring, in both axenic and intracellular amastigotes.

to discover better leishmanicidal compounds, the isolation and purification of the active ingredients of medicinal plants are gaining attention  <cit> . many new natural product groups, such as terpenes, have exhibited antiprotozoal potential and attracted renewed interest with surprising efficacy and selectivity  <cit> .

parthenolide is a lipophilic hydrocarbon compound formed by units of isoprene. the accumulation of lipophilic compounds in the cytoplasmic membrane and membrane constituents of microorganisms has considerable effects on the loss of cellular integrity and inhibition of respiratory cellular activity in mitochondria  <cit> . this interaction with cell membranes eventually leads to cell death. in our research, parthenolide had antileishmanial effects against axenic and intracellular amastigotes of l. amazonensis presenting ic <dig> of  <dig>  after 72 h growth and  <dig>  μm after 24 h growth, respectively. the differences in ic <dig> values can be explained because the experiments with axenic amastigotes are directed against the relevant stage of the parasite whereas the use of intracellular amastigotes will give essential information on the capacity of the drugs to target intracellular organisms. the role played by the macrophages on drug-mediated toxicity may be important. their presence may limit the availability of the compounds under evaluation  <cit> .

the toxicity for j774g <dig> macrophages and the activity against intracellular amastigotes were compared by using the selectivity index ratio   <cit> . the parthenolide was more selective against the intracellular amastigotes than the mammalian cells, with a selectivity index ratio of  <dig> . it is generally considered that biological efficacy is not due to in vitro cytotoxicity when this index is ≥  <dig>  <cit> .

the low toxicity against mammalian cells is an important criterion in the search for active compounds with antiprotozoal activity. for this purpose, the genotoxicity of parthenolide in a mouse model was determined using a micronucleus test and cyclophosphamide as the positive control because it is a known genotoxin  <cit> . micronuclei are masses of cytoplasmic chromatin that appear outside the main nucleus as a result of chromosomal damage or damage to the mitotic apparatus in the erythroblasts of the test species, and they can be used as an indicator of the effects of agents that cause dna damage  <cit> . in mice, micronuclei in mature erythrocytes in peripheral blood live approximately 1 month, providing a measure of average chromosomal damage  <cit> . our results showed no differences in the frequency of mnpce compared with the negative control, demonstrating no toxic effects on bone marrow at the dose tested .

electron microscopic studies revealed extensive cytoplasmic vacuolization, leading to the examination of the possibility that parthenolide induces autophagic cell death. autophagy cell death is a process that is thought to occur in all eukaryotes and is characterized by an accumulation of autophagic vacuoles. this mechanism occurs for energy production for survival when cells recycle their cytoplasmic contents during periods of environmental stress or certain stages of development. a double-membrane vesicle called the autophagosome forms in the cytosol, engulfing organelles and bulk cytoplasm. subsequently, these vesicles fuse with lysosomes, where their contents are degraded and recycled  <cit> . one of the most frequently used methods to examine autophagy is staining with acidotropic dyes  <cit> , and mdc is considered an autofluorescent compound and specific marker for autophagic vacuoles  <cit> . mdc staining is only obtained when the compartments into which it loads are acidic. neutralization of these compartments leads to a swift loss of mdc staining or lack of mdc uptake  <cit> . therefore, we suggest that the vacuoles that were observed under a transmission electron microscope are autophagosomes. another study used mdc as a marker to analyze the molecular level of the machinery involved in the autophagic process  <cit>  and was also used to demonstrate that antimicrobial peptides induce autophagic cell death in l. donovani <cit> .

amphotericin b was used as a positive control in some of our experiments because this polyene antibiotic forms aqueous and nonaqueous pores in membranes, which is the basis of leishmanicidal action  <cit> . using transmission electron microscopy, we could see the loss of membrane integrity induced by this antimicrobial agent. similarly, alterations in the cytoplasmic membrane, including membrane blebbing and disruption, could be visualized in axenic amastigotes treated with parthenolide. studies have shown that a flow cytometric membrane potential assay can be used as a reliable tool for studying the interactions between amphotericin b and the leishmania membrane  <cit> . alterations in membrane permeability are detected by propidium iodide nucleic acid stain that selectively passes through plasma membranes and bind to dna, emitting high fluorescence when excited by an argon ion laser  <cit> . since its introduction, the propidium iodide flow cytometric assay has also been widely used as a quantitative measure of cell apoptosis. during apoptosis, dna fragmentation occurs, with a subsequent loss of cellular dna content  <cit> .

terpenoic compounds can produce major changes in the cellular and mitochondrial membrane structures of different pathogenic agents, modifying their permeability and integrity  <cit> . ultrastructural findings also revealed mitochondrial damage induced by parthenolide. we used flow cytometry analysis to determine whether the compound interferes with the mitochondrial membrane potential of the amastigotes. the flow cytometry results showed that transmembrane potential decreased, reflected by a reduction of rhodamine  <dig> fluorescence. rhodamine  <dig> is a fluorescent cationic stain for mitochondria in living cells and is subsequently washed out of the cells once the mitochondrion’s membrane potential is lost  <cit> . the present results indicated an increase in proton permeability through the internal mitochondrial membrane, inhibition of electron transport, or decrease in mitochondrial substrate transport/oxidation, which would impair proton pumping by mitochondrial complexes and reduce adenosine triphosphate synthesis, resulting in parasite cell death  <cit> . cccp was used as positive control because it is an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation and reduces mitochondrial membrane potential by directly attacking the proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane  <cit> . amastigotes treated with parthenolide presented severe plasma membrane and mitochondrial damage, suggesting an autophagic process  <cit> .

treatment with parthenolide induced shedding of the membranes into the flagellar pocket, appearing as concentric membranes and suggesting intense exocytic activity because this site is where endocytosis and exocytosis occur in trypanosomatids. treatment of promastigote forms of l. amazonensis with edelfosine for 1 day  <cit>  and parthenolide for 3 days  <cit>  also led to the appearance of a large number of vesicles inside the flagellar pocket, suggesting a process of exacerbated protein production by cells as they attempt to survive.

other studies indicated that the plasma membrane of human promyelocytic leukemic hl- <dig> cells appears to be one of the targets of parthenolide because its integrity is lost very early during cell death, reflected by atypical apoptosis and primary necrosis   <cit> .

the lipid spin probe 5-dsa was incorporated into the plasmatic membrane of leishmania in the usual way, and the epr spectra obtained were typical for cell membranes. interestingly, the spectra of the leishmania membrane were very similar to those for the same spin label in erythrocyte membranes  <cit> . the erythrocyte membrane of spin-labeled lipids has been well characterized by epr spectroscopy and is considered to have certain rigidity, particularly because of its high content of protein and cholesterol. the presence of sesquiterpene parthenolide significantly increased the rigidity of the membrane of leishmania when applied to the cell suspension at a ratio of 3 ×  <dig> parthenolide molecules/cell. parthenolide also showed dose-dependent anti-leishmania activity against the amastigote form. the ic <dig> was  <dig>  μm parthenolide/ml for a cell concentration of 1 ×  <dig> cell/ml. therefore, the effect of parthenolide against the amastigote forms of leishmania was observed at a ratio of  <dig>  ×  <dig> parthenolide molecules/cell. the greatest change in membrane fluidity was observed at a concentration  <dig> -fold higher than for growth inhibition. membrane stiffness, assessed by epr spectroscopy of the spin label, has been associated with lipid peroxidation  <cit> . a detailed study of the interaction between parthenolide and membranes and their role as a pro-oxidant in simpler systems is necessary to determine whether the membrane rigidity observed here was attributable to lipid peroxidation.

CONCLUSIONS
our results indicated that the antileishmanial action of parthenolide is associated with autophagic vacuole appearance, membrane stiffness, the loss of membrane integrity, and mitochondrial dysfunction. these results indicate that parthenolide induced amastigote cell death by autophagy, but other mechanisms of cell death cannot be dismissed, such as apoptosis and necrosis. considering the limited repertoire of existing antileishmanial compounds, continuously developing new leishmanicidal compounds is essential. in the ongoing search for the best antileishmanial compounds, products derived from plants are gaining ground. the isolation and purification of the active components of medicinal plants has been one the greatest advances. additionally, delineation of the biochemical mechanisms involved in mediating effect of these compounds would help develop new chemotherapeutic approaches.
