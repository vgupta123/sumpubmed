BACKGROUND
disabled- <dig>  was originally isolated as a cytoplasmic src-binding protein that becomes strongly tyrosine phosphorylated when co-expressed with constitutively activated src <cit> . binding of reelin, a large secreted signaling protein, to the extracellular domains of vldlr and apoer <dig> rapidly induces tyrosine phosphorylation of dab <dig> <cit> , which is required for proper positioning of neurons in the developing mammalian brain. moreover, dab <dig> contains two leucine-rich nuclear export signal  sequences and a bipartite nuclear localization signal  sequence and functions as a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein <cit> . efficient tyrosine phosphorylation of dab <dig> requires the activation of src family non-receptor tyrosine kinases , and sfks can undergo autoactivation in the presence of phosphorylated dab <dig> <cit> . as a member of the sfks, fyn tyrosine kinase is a critical regulator of dab <dig> during brain development <cit> . reeler-like phenotypes were found in mutants deficient in dab <dig> <cit>  or both src tyrosine kinase family members fyn and src <cit> .

phosphorylation of dab <dig> is required for proper dab <dig> function. there are five tyrosine residues in dab <dig> , which correspond to four conserved tyrosine phosphorylation sites. mice with phenylalanine substitutions of all of these five tyrosines exhibit a reeler phenotype <cit> . it was reported that src can phosphorylate all five tyrosines in vitro, but that y <dig> and y <dig> represent the major sites of reelin-induced dab <dig> phosphorylation in embryonic neurons <cit> . binding of lis <dig> to dab <dig> also depends on phosphorylation at either y <dig> or y <dig> <cit> . phosphorylation at both y <dig> and y <dig> was shown to be important for binding to members of the crk family of adaptor proteins <cit> . these residues are required for the detachment of migrating neurons from radial glial fiber <cit>  and are also essential for nckÎ² binding <cit> .

functions of dab <dig> and fyn could be regulated at the transcript level by alternative splicing. isoforms of dab <dig> are species-specific and have different tissue expression profiles. different mrnas encode at least four mouse dab <dig> isoforms of  <dig>  555*,  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids. in early embryonic mouse brain, the dab <dig> isoform 555* was predominant, while in later stages dab <dig> does not contain this fragment <cit> . in human, there are two dab <dig> isoforms,  <dig> and 555* <cit> . similarly, at least three alternatively spliced forms of dab <dig> are expressed at different stages during zebrafish development <cit> . two alternatively spliced variants of dab <dig> were isolated from chick retina: an early form  expressed in undifferentiated cells, and a late form  expressed in amacrine and ganglion cells <cit> . two distinct fyn isoforms exhibit mutually exclusive expression patterns; one is found mainly in the brain , while the second form is found in the immune system, e.g. in thymocytes and splenocytes  <cit> . a third splice-variant of fyn , in which exon  <dig> is absent, was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells <cit> .

pig is an important animal model for genetic and biomedical research because of the similarities between human and swine anatomy, biochemistry, physiology, size and genetics <cit> . pig models for the study of the developing brain <cit> , retinal disease <cit>  and pluripotent stem cells <cit>  have been developed. recently, the structure and developmental expression of pig reelin was described  <cit> . in the present study, alternatively spliced isoforms of dab <dig> and fyn were isolated from pig, and the different isoforms exhibited tissue-specific expression patterns. moreover, we studied the chromosome localization, subcellular distribution and interaction of dab <dig> and fyn. these data provide basic molecular information useful for further studies on the function of dab <dig> and fyn isoforms in the pig and support the usefulness of this animal model in the study of neurodevelopmental disorders.

RESULTS
cloning of porcine dab <dig> and fyn isoforms
using rt-pcr, two isoforms of dab <dig> were amplified from pig; one was from cerebral cortex cdna and named sus scrofa disabled  <dig> . this isoform corresponded to the full-length dab <dig> protein. the other, shorter isoform was isolated from liver cdna and named sus scrofa disabled 1-liver . the ways to generate both alternatively spliced sdab <dig> isoforms are shown in figure 1-a. in the middle row, we show the genomic organization of porcine dab <dig> gene, which includes relative positions of all the putative exons and introns based on human dab <dig> genomic structure. obtained partial mrnas , consisting of  <dig> bp  and  <dig> bp , respectively, were verified by sequencing and deposited at genbank under accession numbers dq <dig>  and ef <dig> . the sdab <dig> coding sequence had a high level of similarity to the human , mouse , rat  and chicken  nucleotide sequences. the start codons of sdab <dig> and sdab1-li are at the same position in deduced exon  <dig>  furthermore, sdab <dig> and sdab1-li have two major differences:  exon  <dig> and  <dig>  were spliced out in sdab <dig>  whereas, exons  <dig> and  <dig> were spliced out in sdab1-li;  the stop codon of sdab <dig> was located at exon  <dig>  however, exon  <dig> was excluded in sdab1-li and it stopped at exon  <dig>  tyrosine phosphorylation is critical for dab <dig> function <cit> . the deduced protein region corresponding to exon  <dig> and  <dig> overlaps with two non-receptor tyrosine kinase recognition sites: y198qy200i and y220qvp , which means that three functional tyrosine  residues were spliced out in sdab1-li.

using rt-pcr, two isoforms of fyn were amplified from pig, one was from cerebral cortex cdna which is the porcine counterpart of fyn-b in other species and thus named sus scrofa fyn-brain ; another was from spleen cdna which is the porcine counterpart of fyn-t in other species and thus was named sus scrofa fyn-t . the ways to generate both alternatively spliced sfyn isoforms are shown in figure 1-c. in the middle row, we show the genomic organization of porcine fyn gene, which includes the relative positions of all the putative exons and introns based on human fyn genomic structure. both isoforms have the same start and stop codon positions in deduced exon  <dig> and exon  <dig>  respectively. the obtained coding regions, consisting of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp, respectively, were verified by sequencing and deposited at genbank under accession numbers dq <dig>  and fj <dig> . the coding sequence of porcine fyn-b shares  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % identity with its homologues in human, monkey, mouse and rat, respectively. the major difference between sfyn-b and sfyn-t is that the exon  <dig> is spliced out in sfyn-b, whereas in sfyn-t the exon  <dig> is excluded.

the chromosomal localizations of porcine dab <dig> and fyn were determined using a porcine radiation hybrid  panel. porcine dab <dig> was mapped to chromosome 6q31- <dig> at a distance of 43cr, 59cr and 72cr to its three closest linked markers sw <dig> , sw <dig>  and sw <dig> , respectively. porcine fyn was mapped to chromosome 1p <dig> at a distance of 49cr and 70cr to its two closest linked markers sw <dig>  and sw <dig> , respectively, confirming and extending data from the ncbi pig genome resource .

tissue distribution of porcine dab1/dab1-li and fyn-b/fyn-t
real-time quantitative rt-pcr was used to investigate the expression pattern of porcine dab1/dab1-li and fyn-b/fyn-t in various tissues of 2-month-old pigs. primers 9/ <dig> were designed within sdab <dig> specific exons  <dig> and  <dig>  while primers 11/ <dig> were designed within sdab1-li specific exons  <dig> and  <dig>  the forward primer  <dig> was designed within exon  <dig>  while primer  <dig> was designed within exon  <dig>  and they both were used together with reverse primer  <dig> which was designed within exon  <dig> to detect sfyn-b and sfyn-t, respectively. as shown in figure 2-a, b, sdab <dig> and sdab1-li exhibited distinct tissue-specific expression patterns. full-length sdab <dig> was expressed at relatively high levels in testicle, cerebrum and cerebellum; besides, it was detected at lower levels in liver and adipose tissue, and at very low levels in the rest of the tissues . sdab1-li was expressed at relatively high levels in testicle and liver, at lower levels in adipose tissue and very low levels in the rest of the tissues . as shown in figure 2-c, d, sfyn-b and sfyn-t also exhibited distinct tissue-specific expression patterns. compared to sfyn-b mrna, which was abundant in testicle, cerebrum, cerebellum, lung and adipose tissue, sfyn-t mrna was expressed at relatively high levels in porcine spleen and lung. sfyn-b mrna was expressed at low levels in heart, liver, spleen and kidney; and at very low levels in stomach, muscle and intestine , whereas sfyn-t was expressed at very low levels except for spleen and lung .

spatio-temporal expression of porcine sdab <dig> and sfyn-b
apart from regulation of neuronal migration during embryonic development, reelin-dab1-sfks signaling is also relevant for the modulation of synaptic plasticity and learning in the adult mouse brain <cit> . hence, it is important to test temporal expression patterns of sdab <dig> and sfyn-b in the postnatal pig brain. cerebral cortex and cerebellum of 1-, 2-, 4-, 7-month-old meishan pigs were chosen to investigate the temporal expression profiles of sdab <dig> and sfyn-b. of note, they exhibited similar expression profiles. the expression of sdab <dig> and sfyn-b reached the highest level in the cerebral cortex at the age of  <dig> months   and at the age of  <dig> months  in the cerebellum , respectively, and declined afterwards.

sdab <dig> and sdab1-li are both suggested to be nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins
it was reported that dab <dig> is not only a cytoplasmic adaptor protein, but also a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein. dab <dig> contains two leucine-rich nes sequences  and a bipartite nls sequence  <cit> . scanning of the deduced protein sequences of sdab <dig> and sdab1-li revealed the presence of these three signal sequences in both porcine dab <dig> proteins. to test if both isoforms can shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, we transiently introduced the sdab1-gfp and sdab1-li-gfp expression plasmids into ibrs <dig> cells.  <dig> h after transfection, the cells were treated with  <dig> ng/ml lmb , a rangtp-dependent inhibitor of the nuclear export factor exportin  <dig> , for  <dig> hours. in the absence of lmb, almost 100% of the sdab1- and sdab1-li-transfected cells showed cytoplasmic distribution. however, lmb treatment led to equal distribution between the cytoplasm and nucleus . this suggests that sdab <dig> and sdab1-li are indeed nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins and that alternative splicing does not influence their nucleocytoplasmic shuttling properties. the aggregate-like structures seen in figure 4-a might correspond to filopodia, which have been described in cos- <dig> cells overexpressing murine dab <dig> <cit> .

co-localization of sfyn-b with sdab <dig> and sdab1-li in primary neurons
reelin activates fyn to phosphorylate and downregulate dab <dig> during brain development <cit> . to understand whether sfyn could interact with sdab <dig> isoforms, we detected their localization while simultaneously overexpressing both of them in primary hippocampal neurons. sfyn-b-red and sdab1-gfp or sdab1-li-gfp were co-transfected to div <dig> primary hippocampal neurons. as shown in figure  <dig>  sfyn-b-red is co-localized with sdab1-gfp , and sfyn-b-red is co-localized with sdab1-li-gfp , demonstrating that sfyn-b can co-localize with both sdab <dig> isoforms. these findings indicate that sfyn might interact not only with sdab <dig>  but also with sdab1-li.

phosphorylation of sdab <dig> isoforms by sfyn at specific sites
to figure out whether both sdab <dig> isoforms could be phosphorylated by sfyn in vitro, we co-expressed sfyn-b with either sdab <dig> or sdab1-li into cos <dig> cells. then anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4g <dig> was used to detect the total tyrosyl-phosphorylation of sdab <dig> isoforms. the membranes were also probed with anti-dab <dig>  anti-fyn and anti-tubulin antibodies in order to confirm equal protein expression and loading. the result is shown in figure 6-a, indicating that both sdab <dig>  and sdab1-li  can indeed be tyrosine-phosphorylated by sfyn-b, although phosphorylation of sdab1-li was much weaker than that of the full-length sdab <dig> isoform.

to further identify specific tyrosyl sites of sdab <dig> isoforms that could be phosphorylated by sfyn, we co-transfected sfyn-b with either sdab <dig> or sdab1-li into cos <dig> cells . at the same time, sfyn-b was co-transfected with murine wild-type dab <dig>  or murine dab1-5f , which was carrying single phenylalanine substitutions at tyr <dig>  tyr <dig>  tyr <dig>  tyr <dig> and tyr <dig>  as positive and negative controls, respectively . second, we added pp <dig>  a specific inhibitor of sfks, to the same set of co-transfections . third, we transfected sdab <dig>  sdab1-li, mdab1-wt or mdab1-5f separately without any exogenous fyn . then anti-py <dig>  anti-py198/ <dig>  anti-py <dig> and anti-py <dig> antibodies were used to detect tyrosyl-phosphorylation of the respective dab <dig> residues by western blotting. the membranes were also probed with anti-dab <dig>  anti-fyn and anti-tubulin antibodies in order to confirm equal protein expression and loading.

as shown in figure 6-b, anti-py <dig> immunoreactivity was detected in lysates of cells cotransfected with sdab <dig>  sdab1-li or mdab1-wt and sfyn, although the signal of overexpressed sdab1-li was very weak . anti-py <dig> reacted with sdab <dig>  sdab1-li and mdab1-wt cotransfected with sfyn , whereas anti-py198/ <dig> did not react with sdab1-li plus sfyn . the anti-py <dig> antibody was not specific. as one would expect, pretreatment of the cotransfected cells with the sfk inhibitor pp <dig>  or omission of exogenous fyn  mitigated or abrogated the tyrosyl phosphorylation of dab <dig> isoforms.

our results suggest that fyn can phosphorylate the full-length brain isoform of sdab <dig> at all tyrosyl phosphorylation sites, whereas sdab1-li is phosphorylated at y <dig>  and weakly phosphorylated at y <dig> when co-transfected with fyn in a heterologous overexpression system.

discussion
the genomic organization of the dab <dig> gene in human and in mouse shows unusual complexity, spreading more than  <dig> kb of genomic dna and being composed of  <dig> exons encoding the major protein form, some alternatively spliced internal exons, and multiple 5'-exons <cit> . similarly, in zebrafish, the dab <dig> gene spans more than  <dig> kb for a coding region of at least  <dig>  kb. by using the obtained coding sequences of dab <dig> and fyn isoforms to search for their correlated genome sequences in the "high throughput genomic sequences"  database with megablast, we were able to predict the genomic organization of the porcine dab <dig> and fyn genes. from start codon to stop codon, the porcine dab <dig> gene spans more than  <dig> kb, while the porcine fyn gene spans more than  <dig> kb, and they both consist of multiple exons and introns . therefore, our data suggest that the porcine dab <dig> gene consists of at least  <dig> exons  and  <dig> introns, while the porcine fyn gene consists of at least  <dig> exons  and  <dig> introns. in addition, almost all junctions between the introns and exons conform to the gt-ag rule . using pcr on pig cerebrum cdna and alignment of genomic and est sequences, we were unable to identify exons corresponding to mouse dab <dig> forms  <dig> and  <dig> in pig. the alternatively spliced pattern of dab <dig> is species-specific, but different alternative splicing events give rise to isoforms with different numbers of tyrosines. sdab1-li is highly similar to chdab1-e, an isoform that has been identified and characterized in chicken retina <cit> . the alternatively spliced pattern of fyn is similar between species. the spliced seventh exon may have been derived from a recombinational event with another gene <cit> .

note: "?" means intron was not found by megablast.

scanning the deduced proteins of sdab <dig> and sdab1-li against prosite  indicates that they both contain a ptb/protein interaction  domain from amino acid  <dig> to  <dig>  these data suggest that both isoforms could compete for the same receptors, but only the isoform that carries target tyrosines can interact with corresponding molecules and transduce the signal, while the other one might work as a dominant negative form. a form of chicken dab <dig> that is very similar to sdab1-li, called chdab1-e, has been shown not to be tyrosine phosphorylated upon reelin stimulation and not to interact with crkl <cit> . the scan of the deduced proteins of sfyn-b and sfyn-t against prosite suggests that the alternatively spliced sixth exon couldn't change the domain arrangement of fyn; they share the same domain arrangement, possessing a src homology  <dig>  domain which directs specific association with proline rich motifs, followed by a src homology  <dig>  domain which provides interaction with phosphotyrosine motifs, and a kinase domain responsible for the enzymatic activity.

we mapped porcine dab <dig> and fyn to chromosome 6q31- <dig> and 1p <dig>  respectively. the syntenic regions of porcine 6q31- <dig> and 1p <dig> on human chromosome are 1p32- <dig> and 6q <dig>  respectively, where human dab <dig>  and fyn  are located, which illustrates the accuracy of our localization. we also mapped porcine apoer <dig> to chromosome 6q31- <dig> , which underlines the close functional relationship of porcine dab <dig> and apoer <dig> 

our results indicate that different isoforms of porcine dab <dig> and fyn show distinct tissue expression patterns. the high expression levels of sdab <dig> and sfyn-b in cerebrum and cerebellum imply their important role in the central nervous system of the pig, as shown for other species. both sdab <dig> isoforms and sfyn-b exhibited the highest expression level in testicle. besides, porcine apoer <dig> and vldlr were highly expressed in testicle . it was reported that fyn is required for spermatogenesis <cit> , therefore, their interaction might exert important functions in the reproductive system. also, both sdab <dig> isoforms and sfyn-b were expressed in adipose tissue, and it was shown that the loss of fyn markedly improved insulin sensitivity <cit> , hence, they might interact to influence fatty acid metabolism. the high expression level of sfyn-t in spleen and lung suggests a role in the immune system, as shown in other species; for instance, fyn is required for the activation of t cells <cit> . further investigation is needed to explore the multiple roles of sdab <dig> isoforms in various tissues in addition to the regulation of neuronal migration and neurotransmission.

our results also suggest that both sdab <dig> and sdab1-li can function as nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins, and alternative splicing does not influence their nucleocytoplasmic shuttling properties. after inhibition of nuclear export with leptomycin b, sdab <dig> and sdab1-li were distributed equally between nucleus and the cytoplasm instead of only being localized in nucleus. one possible reason, besides the fact that sdab <dig> was overexpressed, could be that the sdab <dig> isoforms are partly retained by cytoplasmic protein complexes, which prevented them from shuttling. nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of sdab <dig> isoforms implies nuclear functions, e.g. participation in transcriptional regulation.

the maturation of postnatal pig brain is comparable to that of humans with respect to structure and development, which makes pig a useful model for studying traumatic injury and nutrition of the developing brain <cit> . the porcine brain experiences ongoing developmental processes after birth for several months like human's while mouse or rat brain develops mostly in the prenatal phase <cit> . in postnatal pigs, the neocortical synaptophysin expression increases significantly between  <dig> and  <dig> months and slightly decreases by  <dig> months, indicating that porcine neocortex does not reach functional maturity before the age of about  <dig> months <cit> . pond et al. demonstrated that the development of porcine cerebrum and cerebellum is not synchronized, the growth of cerebellum lags behind cerebrum <cit> , which is correlated with our observation that the expression of sdab <dig> and sfyn-b simultaneously reaches highest level in cerebral cortex at the age of  <dig> months  and in cerebellum at the age of  <dig> months . these results are similar to the spatio-temporal expression profile of porcine cdk <dig> that we previously identified <cit> , suggesting that sdab <dig> and sfyn-b might play a crucial role in pig brain development, considering that the developmental peak of pig brain is from  <dig> to  <dig> months after birth.

different alternatively spliced patterns of dab <dig> in different species all generate isoforms with different numbers of phosphorylatable tyrosines. hence, the alternative splicing of the dab <dig> gene might be a conserved strategy to achieve functional regulation of its phosphorylation through evolution. recently, it has been shown that dab <dig> can act both as a kinase switch and a scaffold for assembling signaling complexes in vivo through the phosphorylation of the a/b  and c/d  sites, respectively <cit> . the phosphorylation at a/b sites  of dab <dig> stimulates akt/pi3k signaling and targets phosphorylated dab <dig> for degradation <cit> . here, by using anti-phospho-specific-sites dab <dig> antibodies, we demonstrated that sfyn-b could phosphorylate sdab <dig> at tyr <dig>  -198/ <dig>  and - <dig> as shown previously in mouse <cit> , and phosphorylate sdab1-li weakly at tyr  <dig> and robustly at tyr  <dig>  which corresponds to y <dig> in full-length sdab <dig> . the weak immunoreactivity of anti-py <dig> in lysates of cells cotransfected with sdab1-li and sfyn can be explained by the observation that y <dig> changes its sequence from yqxi to yxvp after splicing of exons  <dig> and  <dig>  corresponding to a switch from an 'a' site to a 'c' site . as a consequence of this splicing event, the sequence surrounding tyrosine  <dig> switches from a 'b' site to a 'd' site, meaning that it corresponds to y <dig> in the full-length porcine dab <dig> . this is consistent with our result that anti-py <dig> but not anti-py198/ <dig> immunoreacts with sdab1-li cotransfected with sfyn . here, we studied the functional interaction between porcine dab <dig> isoforms and fyn in vitro. godbout's group recently showed that chicken dab1-e, which is similar to sdab1-li, was not phosphorylated in the absence of y198/ <dig> and y <dig> in ed <dig> retinal lysates or after reelin treatment of cultured retinal cells <cit> . it will be interesting to determine if sdab1-li can be tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to reelin treatment.

CONCLUSIONS
alternative splicing of porcine dab <dig> generates a natural sdab1-li isoform that only carries y <dig> and y <dig>  sites, which both can be phosphorylated by fyn in vitro. sdab1-li is highly expressed in peripheral organs. both isoforms are suggested to be nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins. sdab1-li might regulate cellular responses to different cell signals by acting as a dominant negative form against sdab <dig>  alternatively, it might be involved in reelin-independent signaling cascades in peripheral organs.

besides the essential functions of dab <dig> and fyn in brain development, they both play a role in tumorigenesis. it was reported that the human dab <dig> gene is located within an unstable common fragile site  region, and its expression level was decreased in many human cancer samples <cit> , including epigenetic silencing in pancreatic cancer cell lines <cit> . in addition, fyn is particularly upregulated in various cancers, including, e.g., prostate cancer, glioblastoma multiforma, and melanoma <cit> . hence, further investigation of the functions of dab <dig> isoforms and fyn will also be of potential importance in oncology. our initial characterization of sfyn and sdab <dig> isoforms provides a basic framework for respective studies in the pig as a model organism.
