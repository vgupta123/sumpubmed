BACKGROUND
eukaryotic genomic dna is packaged around octamers of histones to form the basic structural units of chromatin, the nucleosomes. chromatin is the functional template for a variety of key biological processes, such as dna replication, repair of dna damage, recombination, and transcription.

covalent modifications of the amino-terminal tails of the core histones affect nucleosome positioning and compaction, and therefore play pivotal roles in chromatin remodelling and in gene regulation. histone modifications include acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation and poly-adp-ribosylation  <cit> . among these modifications, acetylation of histones appears as a key switch for inter-conversion between permissive and repressive states of chromatin domains and as in other eukaryotes, histone acetylation and deacetylation play important roles in the regulation of plant gene expression. in general, hyperacetylation of histones relaxes chromatin structure and is associated with transcriptional activation, whereas hypoacetylation of histones induces chromatin compaction and gene repression, although a more sophisticated and nuanced chromatin language is likely to yield dynamic functional outcomes  <cit> . acetylation of histones provides also an epigenetic marker for gene expression because it blocks association of heterochromatin-stabilising complexes  <cit> .

the homeostatic balance of nucleosomal histone acetylation is maintained by antagonistic action of histone acetyltransferases  and histone deacetylases , which are the best-characterized enzymes among histone modifier factors. in arabidopsis, the hat group contains  <dig> members divided into four classes based on sequence homology and mode of action: gnat , p300/cbp, tafii <dig> and myst  families  <cit> .

numerous reports have linked specific histone acetyltransferases to transcriptional regulation in arabidopsis. for instance, we and other have shown that gcn <dig>  plays a role in the regulation of numerous processes, including cold tolerance, floral development, embryonic cell-fate patterning, and light responsiveness  <cit> . haf <dig>  one of the two tafii <dig> homologs in arabidopsis is necessary for upregulating the transcription of light-induced genes  <cit> . hac <dig>  hac <dig> and hac <dig> of the cbp family have been shown to be involved in regulating flowering time  <cit> . functions for other predicted arabidopsis hats have not yet been determined.

in mammals, the myst family is the largest and most divergent. it has been intensely studied because of its broad conservation and biological significance. experiments performed in the last few years show that myst family proteins are involved in a wide range of cell function ranging from transcription activation and silencing, apoptosis, cell cycle progression, dna replication or dna repair with often a link to pathological disorder such as cancer . for instance, histone acetyltransferase bound to orc  has been shown to interact both with orc <dig> and with mcm <dig>  essential proteins of the pre-replication complex   <cit>  and to positively regulate pre-rc assembly and initiation of dna-replication  <cit> . another mammalian myst protein, hiv tat-interacting protein  <dig> , seems to be a functional homologue of the yeast protein esa <dig>  <cit> , which is the only essential hat for yeast viability, playing a role in cell cycle progression  <cit> . it appears that this function has been conserved during evolution and several recent results provide evidence that tip <dig> is a key protein in regulating cell cycle progression in higher organisms. likewise, a broad range of functions has been ascribed to tip <dig> as its involvement in dna repair or regulation of apoptosis . morf  may be involved in early mammalian gametogenesis  <cit> , whereas the mouse orthologue, querkopf, has been implicated in neural development and maintenance of neural stem cells  <cit> . at last, it has been recently shown, that mof  is essential for progression of embryonic development in mice  <cit> .

two myst family members  are present in the a. thaliana genome  <cit> . they were demonstrated to possess an in vitro hat activity specific for lysine  <dig> of histone h <dig>   <cit> . however, the relevance of such observations to the biological roles of ham <dig> and ham <dig> has not been addressed.

here, we report on the phylogenetic analysis of myst family, which appears clearly separate from other families of hat. by analyzing loss-of-function lines in arabidopsis, we show that the two members of this family are functionally redundant, and provide evidence that they are required post-meiotically for important cellular process during the formation of both the male and female gametes.

RESULTS
phylogenetic analysis of myst proteins
initially, members of the myst group were classified as putative acetyltransferases based on a region in the myst domain that is homologous to the canonical acetyl-coa binding domain  found in gnat superfamily acetyltransferases  <cit> . the arabidopsis genome encodes two closely related myst family proteins ham <dig> and ham <dig> , also known as respectively hag <dig> and hag <dig>  <cit> . wolfe data  postulated that ham <dig>  and ham <dig>  resulted from a duplication event, the α event according to  <cit> , produced by a polyploidization in the brassicaceae ancestor. the arabidopsis thaliana ham <dig> and ham <dig> genes show a ks value of  <dig> . in their measure of divergence between duplicated genes, de bodt et al.   <cit>  conclude that the most recent polyploidization event corresponds to a modal ks value between  <dig>  and  <dig> . this reinforce the previous observation that the ham <dig> and ham <dig> genes from arabidopsis belong to duplicated segments produced by the most recent polyploidization event in the brassicaceae ancestor.

in order to identify the closest sequences to ham <dig> and ham <dig>  a phylogenetic analysis of the myst proteins was performed by an extensive search in available databases. amino acid alignements of the myst domain were used as the basis for classifying myst proteins. fig. 1a shows an unrooted phylogenetic tree illustrating the relationship between  <dig> myst proteins  selected on a total of  <dig> 

the myst family is divided into five unrelated classes, i.e. not related by significant bootstrap values. the class i comprises proteins from the green lineage including the arabidopsis ham <dig> and ham <dig> sequences, two clades of sequences from mammals, teleostei, insects and cnidarian, and clades of sequences from alveolata, fungi, nematods and plathelminthes. the class ii  groups sequences of fungi plus one sequence of insect. classes iii and iv  are exclusively composed of sequences from fungi. the class v  enclosed sequences from teleostei, archausauria, mammals and insects. three sequences  form a small additionnal group .

we also noticed that the myst proteins from the green lineage  lie within a cluster supported by a significant bootstrap value . this cluster is associated both with two sequences of alveolata and  <dig> sequences of dictyostelium discoideum, as is frequently observed for sequences from plants. a second cluster of myst sequence from prasinophyceae  is observed. the green lineage phylogenetic tree appears robust with highly significant bootstrap values . members of the myst family of acetyltransferases possess several protein domains. structural analysis by using pfam and smart tools revealed that within each previously defined group, domain organizations of the myst proteins are highly similar . class i members possess a chromodomain  in the amino-terminus and a zinc finger  contiguous to a moz-sas acetyltransferase domain . the structure is reduced to the zinc finger and moz-sas domains in classes ii and iii. class iv possesses a phd finger  in the amino-terminus and a central moz-sas domain. finally, sequences from class v were much longer, with a linker histone h <dig> and h <dig> family domain , one or two phd finger domain, both at the amino terminus, a c2h <dig> type zinc finger, contiguous to the moz-sas domain and an extensin-like region  at the carboxy terminus. the observed domain organization and protein sizes reinforced the idea of existence of several distinct myst subfamilies.

loss-of-function mutations at the ham <dig> and ham <dig> loci
in order to study the developmental function of plant myst genes, a search in arabidopsis t-dna insertion mutant collections was performed. three insertion lines in ham <dig> gene were identified. ham <dig> mutants, ham1- <dig>  ham1- <dig> and ham1- <dig>  disrupt the predicted coding region at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bp in the genomic dna and downstream of the initiation codon, respectively . a single insertion line, ham <dig>  was identified in ham <dig> gene. the t-dna insert is located  <dig> bp downstream of the atg . all these mutants are in columbia- <dig>  background, except for ham1- <dig> in the wassilewskija  background.

homozygous insertion plants were identified by pcr. rt-pcr experiments, with primers that span the insertion sites, were neither able to detect any ham <dig> mrna in the ham <dig> mutants nor ham <dig> mrna in ham <dig> mutant . there were no changes in the level of ham <dig> mrna in ham <dig> mutants lines compared with control. similarly, ham <dig> mrna was unchanged in ham <dig> homozygous plants . this indicates that the absence of one ham transcript does not affect expression of the other.

we did not observed any abnormal phenotype in plants homozygous for either ham <dig> or ham <dig> mutations when grown under standard conditions. in addition, each of the mutant alleles displayed a normal mendelian segregation ratio . as ham <dig> and ham <dig> are closely related genes, functional redundancy might exist to prevent the appearance of a mutant phenotype in the homozygous mutant lines. therefore, ham1- <dig>  ham1- <dig> and ham1- <dig> homozygous plants were respectively crossed with ham <dig> homozygous plants to create double mutants. the resulting double-heterozygous f <dig> were allowed to be self-fertilized and individuals from the resulting progeny were genotyped using pcr. for each crosses, from more than  <dig> f <dig> individuals, no homozygous double mutants were detected. however, plants homozygous for insertion at one locus and heterozygous at the other were found. such plants with either the genotype ham1/ham1; ham2/ham <dig> or ham1/ham1; ham2/ham <dig> were allowed to self-pollinate. for this f <dig> population, the expected frequency of ham1ham <dig> plants is 25%. from  <dig> seedlings from a ham1/ham1-1; ham2/ham <dig> parent, no ham1-1ham <dig> plants were found . from  <dig> seedlings from a ham1-1/ham1-1; ham2/ham <dig> parent, no ham1-1ham <dig> plants were found . these data strongly indicate that ham1ham <dig> double mutant plants are not viable. because f <dig> and f <dig> seeds appeared to be 100% viable, without seedling lethality after germination , the loss of a double mutant plant must have occurred early during seed development or before fertilization and suggested that ham <dig> and ham <dig> have a redundant but important function for arabidopsis embryo development and/or male/female gametophyte formation.

ham1ham <dig> double mutant is affected in gametogenesis
if only the ham1ham <dig> developing seeds were not viable, then the progeny of self-fertilize ham1/ham1; ham2/ham <dig> and ham1/ham1; ham2/ham <dig> plants allowed to self-fertilize would segregate 2/ <dig> for heterozygous and homozygous wild type at the heterozygous locus of the parent. however, the observation was that the percentage of heterozygous seedlings was much less than 67%, with only  <dig> % heterozygous at the ham <dig> locus and  <dig> % heterozygous at the ham <dig> locus . this deviation from a standard inheritance pattern implies death of more than just the double null developing seed.

to confirm this hypothesis, the fertility of ham1/ham1; ham2/ham <dig> and ham1/ham1; ham2/ham <dig> mutants was determined after self-fertilization and compared to the wild-type. for different genotypes, the length of the siliques was reduced . for example, in the case of the ham1/ham1-1; ham2/ham <dig> sesquimutant, the length of the siliques was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  cm compared to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  cm for the wild-type . the number of seeds per silique was significantly reduced compared to wild-type siblings and was greater than the 25% loss expected by loss of the double mutant . in addition, dissected siliques illustrated that unfertilized ovules were presents . this suggests that the loss of inheritance of the mutant allele occurred early, as a result of female gametophyte death.

between  <dig> and  <dig> siliques from the main inflorescence stem of 5-week-old plants were manually dissected and scored for aborted ovules.

a two-tailed p-values represent the fit of the data to an expected segregation of 1: <dig> wild type: aborted.

to distinguish between arrested in embryo development and abnormalities in gametophytes, reciprocal crosses were performed to analyse inheritance via gametophytes. the null alleles, were successfully inherited from male gamete for both loci, although at a rate reduced from the expected 50% frequency . when pollen grains of the ham1/ham1-1; ham2/ham <dig> or ham1-1/ham1-1; ham2/ham <dig> mutants were used to pollinate the stigma of the wild-type female parent, the number of seeds was not significantly different from those observed in the wild-type . the frequency of inheritance of the ham allele from the male was  <dig> % for ham <dig> and 9% for ham <dig> .

when ham1/ham1-1; ham2/ham <dig> or ham1-1/ham1-1; ham2/ham <dig> mutants were used as female parent, cleared siliques from these crosses showed that female gametophyte development was arrested in approximately one half of the ovules . this finding suggests that aborted ovules may correspond to a female gamete ham1ham <dig>  genotyping of the progenies confirmed that the inheritance of the ham alleles from the female was null for ham <dig> and ham <dig> .

to track the expression stage of the ham1ham <dig> mutations, we therefore examined the viability of pollens of the mutants. pollens collected from wild-type and mutants bearing one copy of either ham <dig> or ham <dig> were stained with alexander solution, which stained mature viable pollen grains as purple and dead or dying ones as dark green. the majority of examined pollens from wild-type were viable  with very few dead ones. in anthers of ham1-1/ham1-1; ham2/ham <dig> mutants, however, only approximately 60% of pollens grains showed a staining pattern similar to that of the wild-type, the remaining were stained as dark green . these data are consistant with the reduce transmission of ham <dig> allele describe previously . morphologically, the dead pollens were misshapen and smaller , which could easily be distinguished from wild-type pollens .

we further analyzed male gametophyte development in the double mutant by fluorescence and microscopy. the pollen grain is the male gametophyte in angiosperms. during microsporogenesis, meiosis of the microspore mother cell produces a tetrad of microspores. after release from the tetrad, during microgametogenesis, each microspore goes through an asymmetric cell division, pollen mitosis i , to produce a bicellular pollen grain containing a generative cell and a much larger vegetative cell. only the smaller generative cell undergoes a second round of cell division, pollen mitosis ii, to produce two sperm cells  <cit> . pollen grains collected from open flowers of both wild-type and mutants bearing one copy of either ham <dig> or ham <dig>  were examined by staining with dna-specific dye 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole . when wild-type flowers were open, pollen grains were already mature, and they had two brightly stained sperm nuclei and a faintly stained vegetative nucleus . in single mutant plants, microsporogenesis proceeds normally . by contrast, a part of pollens derived from ham1/ham1-1; ham2/ham <dig> and ham1-1/ham1-1; ham2/ham <dig> sesquimutant flowers displayed one large dna mass . these observations suggest that the degeneration of ham1ham <dig> double mutant pollens occurred mainly at the uninucleated stage before the first pollen mitosis .

on the female side, during megagametogenesis, meiosis of the megaspore mother cell gives rise to four megaspores, but three degenerates and one survives. this cell undergoes three round of mitosis to form a seven-celled mature embryo sac  at female gametophyte stage  <dig> . the analysis of ovule development of ham <dig> and ham <dig> single mutants, using a chloral hydrate clearing protocol and normarski optics, indicated that megasporogenesis occurred normally in single ham mutants . in the ovules of sesquimutants bearing one copy of either ham <dig> or ham <dig>  meiosis always resulted in a single surviving megaspore and as occurred in wild-type, only one of them survived. initial abnormalities in megagametogenesis were observed only after the completion of meiosis. while half the ovules in both ham1/ham1-1; ham2/ham <dig> and ham1-1/ham1-1; ham2/ham <dig> siliques were mature showing a wild-type size and shape , the remaining ovules contained only one nucleus localized to the micropylar pole . they produced the 50% aborted ovules . these observations suggest that, as observed for the male gametophytic development, the degeneration of the ovule in ham1ham <dig> double mutants occurs after the uninucleated stage before the first mitosis.

expression pattern of ham genes
the ham <dig> and ham <dig> mrna levels in different organs and tissues were too low to be detected by northern blots. rt-pcr experiments were used to analyse the expression pattern of ham genes. fig.  <dig> shows that ham <dig> and ham <dig> genes displayed a similar expression pattern in the different tested organs, with higher expression in flowers compared to leaves, stems and roots and in younger growing leaves compared to mature leaves.

transgenic arabidopsis lines were also generated to express the β-glucuronidase  reporter gene under the control of ham <dig> or ham <dig> promoter. about  <dig> kb dna fragments encompassing the putative promoter regions of ham genes were fused to the gus coding sequence and these constructs were introduced into col- <dig>  a reproducible and overlapping expression pattern was found in three independent reporter lines for each promoter. under standard growth conditions, promoter activity was detected in the shoot apex of the seedlings as well as in the cotyledons and leaves . in leaves, a patchy expression pattern was observed which corresponded to strong gus staining at the basis of the trichomes . gus activity was never detected in the hypocotyls and petiole. a faint gus signal was occasionally detected in root hairs  but never in the internal root tissues. by contrast, gus activity was strong in developing flowers, particularly in the anthers and gynoecia but not in mature flowers  in which a slight gus activity was localized to the stigma. transversal sections confirmed the gus staining in developing gynoecia  and young pollens  and the absence of gus expression in mature tricellular pollen grains .

discussion
the myst family of hats has been intensively studied because of its broad conservation and its involvement in multiple aspects of animal development . although the hat activity of the arabidopsis myst proteins ham <dig> and ham <dig> have been demonstrated in vitro  <cit> , the in vivo roles of the proteins have not yet been addressed. here, we initiated a functional characterization of the myst gene family in arabidopsis.

growing genomic sequence data indicates that most eukaryotes had multiple myst representatives. in order to gain insight into the origin and evolution of the myst proteins, we combined phylogenetic sequence analysis and structural comparisons to determine the relationships among different members. such phylogenetic analysis has been already performed by sanjuan et al.  <cit> , but it was realized with a limited number of data and do not provide precise links between clades. our phylogenetic analysis suggests that eukaryotes acquired  <dig> ancestral myst sequences . it appears that one of these ancient sequences has been duplicated more recently, after the separation of teleostei from archausauria and mammals. it seems to, that one of these sequences has been lost during early plant evolution, before the emergence of prasinophyceae, followed by the lost of a second one before the emergence of bryophytes. an alternative hypothesis would be a unique sequence at the beginning of the green lineage, with the acquisition of second sequence by green algae, followed by the lost of one of these sequences  later during the green lineage evolution. this hypothesis suggests also the presence of three sequences before the emergence of fungi and metazoans.

the plant genomes were found to encode one or two myst proteins whereas fungal genomes were found to have one to three, and animal genomes one to five. thus, the number of plant myst family is within the range found in other eukaryotic organisms but at the lower end of this range. the degree of evolutionary change differs significantly among myst gene families. at one extreme, the myst family has been amplified in mammals and drosophila as compared to two members in arabidopsis. moreover domain and phylogenetic analyses of the myst-type proteins revealed only one class of these proteins in plants, as compared to  <dig> classes in insects and mammals. this suggests that plant may have conserved the functions of their ancestral homologues and that arabidopsis myst proteins may be involved in a wide range of cell functions which are assumed by different proteins in mammals. an important point is that we do not detect sequences of other hats from angiosperms inserted in the phylogenetic tree built with sequences of the myst family. this suggests a very old age of the myst sequences, which were clearly separated from other families of hat.

in order to study the biological function of the two plant myst proteins, we performed a genetic analysis using arabidopsis mutants. the study has shown that ham <dig> and ham <dig> are functionally redundant and the presence of at least one functional ham gene is required for the plant, as single ham <dig> or ham <dig> mutant plants are viable and have a wild-type phenotype, while no double mutant seedling was recovered. ham1ham <dig> double mutation was not inherited because it caused mitotic defects in the mega and microgametophyte development as observed in individuals that contained a single wild-type copy of either ham <dig> or ham <dig>  during ovule development in ham1/ham1; ham2/ham <dig> or ham1/ham1; ham2/ham <dig>  abnormalities were detected after meiosis but before the first mitotic division in megagametogenesis. they produced 50% of aborted ovules ham1ham <dig>  on the male side, pollen meiosis also appeared normal, while microsporogenesis was arrested also after microspores release but before the first pollen mitosis. in contrast to megagametogenesis, part of the ham1ham <dig> male gametes were able to produce normal pollen and were inherited.

thus, in arabidopsis, ham proteins are redundantly required post-meiotically for important cellular processes during gametophytic development. however, the identification of ham1/ham1; ham2/ham <dig> and ham1/ham1; ham2/ham <dig> individuals, and the data collected from outcrossing eliminated the possibility of a complete male gametophytic lethal phenotype, although there was some implication of high gametophytic lethality from the sesquimutant plants. given that in both mutants, the two t-dna insertion sites are located at the beginning of the genes, before the hat domain, it is unlikely that the truncated proteins ham <dig> and ham <dig> retain a partial hat activity in the mutants. one possible explanation for the genetic complexity is the diffusion of trace amounts of functional protein from surrounding heterozygous tissues into the gametes  <cit> . it is also possible that meiotic cells contain a pool of proteins or mrna that allows several rounds of nuclear division to occur before the effect of the mutation can be observed  <cit> .

a possible involvement of the myst protein in the gametogenesis has been recently suggested in mammals. the two human myst proteins, tip <dig> and mof, related to ham , are both very highly expressed during sperm development compared to other organs  <cit> . human myst <dig>  also named moz <dig> or morf is also localized into specialized cells of the ovary and testis and may contribute to important and specific acetylation events during gametogenesis  <cit> . however, these reports are based only on pattern of genes expression and protein localization. the phenotypes of arabidopsis knock-out mutants, described here, are the first demonstration of an essential role of myst proteins in gametogenesis.

using transgenic plants expressing the gus reporter gene, a strong promoter activity of ham genes was observed in young flowers, particularly during gynoecium and anther development, which is consistent with the requirement of ham <dig> and ham <dig> for gametogenesis. however, gus expression and rt-pcr results have shown that ham genes expression was not restricted to cells involved in gametogenesis. an expression pattern was also observed during vegetative development. interestingly, a gus activity was detected in trichoblasts . we can note that despite the differences in morphology and distribution, this kind of cells is specified by a similar set of genes  <cit> . gus activity was also detected in shoot apex, cotyledons and leaves but neither in the primary root meristem nor the emerging lateral roots. these results indicate that ham <dig> and ham <dig> expression occurs mainly in some, but not all, proliferative tissues. the broad expression pattern of ham genes suggests that they may be involved in several aspects of development, rather than gametophyte-specific genes.

taking these gus data together with the abnormal nuclear division in ham1ham <dig> gametes it is tempting to speculate a role for the myst family in the control of key cellular process such as cell cycle control. this essentiality of the myst pathway in plants is consistent with data related to the functions of myst proteins in other organisms  <cit> . the closest homologues of arabidopsis myst proteins in homo sapiens are tip <dig> and hsmof . several recent papers provide evidence that tip <dig> is a key protein in regulating cell cycle progression in mammals  <cit> . tip <dig> is also intimately involved in the cellular response to dna damage. additionally, in drosophila the histone acetyltransferase activity of tip <dig> is specifically required for the exchange of histones during double-strand break repair  <cit> . we do not know whether plant ham proteins are directly involved in these processes. although the ontogeny of gametophyte development has been defined in arabidopsis, the molecular mechanisms regulating cell cycle progression are not well understood especially concerning how micro- and macrospores pass through each phase of the cell cycle, such as the g1/s transition during the unicellular stage. a phenotype with defects in the formation of male and female gametophyte due to interphase arrest of mitotic cell cycle at early stages  will facilitate our understanding of the determining factors of gametophyte development. a highly similar phenotype has been recently described for the rhf1arhf2a double mutants which are defective in two ring-finger e <dig> ligases that mediate the degradation of the meiosis-accumulated ick4/krp <dig> that is essential to ensure cell cycle progression during gametogenesis  <cit> . likewise, it has been recently demonstrated that ham <dig> and ham <dig> preferentially acetylate histone h <dig> lysine  <dig>  in a similar fashion to the yeast homologue, esa <dig>  <cit> . during the s-phase, newly synthesized histones h <dig> are deposited in a diacetylated isoform  and it appears to be a highly conserved phenomenon in a wide range of organisms including plants  <cit> . these results are in agreement with a potential role of ham <dig> and ham <dig> during the s-phase. with abnormal nuclear divisions in ham1ham <dig> gametes, it is tempting to speculate a role for the arabidopsis myst family in controlling key cellular processes as dna replication. this hypothesis remains to be tested during further analysis.

CONCLUSIONS
the work presented here reveals novel properties for arabidopsis myst hat. in addition to providing an extensive phylogenetic analysis of this large protein family, we provide evidence of a link between myst and gamete formation in both male and female organs. the getting of conditional mutants with an inducible mis-expression system and the identification of the partners of these factors would also provide new tools to study the implication of myst at the level of cellular process.
