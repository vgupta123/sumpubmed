BACKGROUND
in mammalian cells, two major apoptotic pathways have been described: the extrinsic  pathway and the intrinsic  pathway. the permeabilisation of the mitochondrial outer membrane is a key step in the intrinsic pathway, which proceeds following complex interactions between proapoptotic and antiapoptotic members of the bcl- <dig> superfamily of cell death regulators. the bh3-only bcl- <dig> family protein bim is an important initiator and regulator of the intrinsic pathway since bim can interact with both the antiapoptotic bcl- <dig> proteins and the multidomain proapoptotic effector proteins bax and bak  <cit> .

bim is a critical mediator of apoptosis in many cell types including ngf-dependent sympathetic neurons. in these cells bim rna and bim protein levels increase rapidly following ngf deprivation and peak at around  <dig> hours later  <cit> . overexpression of bimel in sympathetic neurons is sufficient to induce the release of cytochrome c and apoptosis in the presence of ngf and sympathetic and sensory neurons isolated from bim-/- knockout mice are significantly protected from trophic factor withdrawal-induced death  <cit> .

the binding of ngf to the trka tyrosine kinase receptor on the surface of sympathetic neurons activates the pi3-k-akt and raf-mek-erk signalling pathways which can both inhibit apoptosis and promote cell survival  <cit> . it is now evident that a number of regulatory mechanisms exist to prevent the inappropriate expression of bim in neurons. three transcriptional pathways have been described, each of which targets elements within the bim promoter. firstly, bim transcription is repressed by pi3-k-akt signalling: active akt phosphorylates foxo3a, which is sequestered in the cytoplasm by 14-3- <dig> protein and following ngf withdrawal foxo3a translocates into the nucleus of sympathetic neurons and activates bim expression via two conserved foxo binding sites  <cit> . secondly, bim is activated by a cdk4-e2f-myb pathway following ngf withdrawal in neuronally differentiated pc <dig> cells and this requires myb binding sites in the bim promoter  <cit> . thirdly, mlk-jnk-c-jun signalling appears to be critical for bim upregulation in sympathetic neurons: the overexpression of a dominant negative c-jun protein reduces the increase in bim mrna and protein level that occurs after ngf withdrawal  <cit>  and the junaa knock-in mutation, which eliminates the two major jnk phosphorylation sites in c-jun, reduces the increase in bim protein level after ngf withdrawal  <cit> .

post-translational mechanisms that regulate the activity of the bim protein in neuronal cells have also been described. bimel is a target of the raf-mek-erk signalling pathway, which delivers important survival signals in many different cell types. in neuronally differentiated pc <dig> cells maintained in the presence of ngf, bimel is phosphorylated by erk  <cit> , and studies with serum-treated fibroblasts have demonstrated that bimel contains an erk1/ <dig> docking site and erk phosphorylation sites via which the mek1/2-erk1/ <dig> pathway promotes the phosphorylation of bimel leading to its ubiquitylation and degradation via the proteasome  <cit> . furthermore, the erk1/2-dependent phosphorylation of bimel leads to the dissociation of bimel from complexes with the antiapoptotic mcl- <dig> and bcl-xl proteins and also the proapoptotic bax protein  <cit> .

however, it is not known whether the mek-erk pathway controls bim expression in neurons at a step prior to the phosphorylation of bimel. here, we have investigated this using ngf-dependent developing sympathetic neurons. we show that in the presence of ngf, mek-erk signalling reduces bim mrna levels and that this is a transcriptional mechanism mediated through the bim 3' utr.

RESULTS
the mek-erk pathway negatively regulates bim mrna expression independently of the pi3-k-akt and the jnk-c-jun pathways in sympathetic neurons
to investigate whether the mek-erk signalling pathway regulates the steady state level of bim mrna in sympathetic neurons cultured in the presence of ngf, we used a well characterised mek inhibitor, u <dig>  to reduce mek and therefore erk activity. to confirm that phospho-erk1/ <dig> levels are reduced when sympathetic neurons are treated with u <dig>  immunoblots were performed with extracts from sympathetic neurons either maintained in ngf-containing medium or treated with increasing concentrations of u <dig> in the presence of ngf . treatment of sympathetic neurons with u <dig> at  <dig> μm strongly reduced the phosphorylation of erk <dig> and erk <dig>  whereas total erk protein levels were not altered .

next, we verified that bim protein levels are upregulated in sympathetic neurons following treatment with u <dig> or with the pi3-k inhibitor ly <dig> . immunoblots were performed using extracts from sympathetic neurons either maintained in ngf-containing medium, withdrawn from ngf for  <dig> hours or treated with either ly <dig>  or u <dig>  in the presence of ngf for  <dig> hours. bim protein levels increased strongly following ngf withdrawal and following treatment with u <dig> or with ly <dig>  whereas α-tubulin protein levels were not altered .

we then confirmed that u <dig> inhibits mek-erk signalling without affecting the two major signalling pathways known to be involved in bim regulation, the pi3-k-akt pathway and the jnk-c-jun pathway . immunoblots were performed with extracts from sympathetic neurons either maintained in the presence of ngf, withdrawn from ngf for  <dig> hours or treated with u <dig>  for  <dig> hours in the presence of ngf. as expected, we found that the level of phosphorylation of akt at ser  <dig> is high when neurons are maintained in the presence of ngf and falls following ngf withdrawal  <cit>   and that c-jun phosphorylation at serine  <dig> increases following ngf withdrawal  <cit>  . importantly, treatment with u <dig> did not affect phospho-akt or phospho-c-jun levels , thereby confirming that the pi3-k-akt and the jnk-c-jun pathways are independent of mek-erk signalling in sympathetic neurons.

to investigate whether the mek-erk pathway regulates bim mrna levels, we carried out q-pcr with cdna prepared from sympathetic neurons maintained in ngf-containing medium, withdrawn from ngf for  <dig> hours, or treated with either ly <dig>  or u <dig>  in the presence of ngf for  <dig> hours . the level of bim mrna was analysed relative to the level of the transcripts for the house-keeping genes hprt <dig> and gapdh. bim mrna levels relative to hprt <dig> are shown , since both house-keeping genes behaved in a similar way. after ngf withdrawal, the level of bim mrna increased by  <dig> fold and upon treatment with ly <dig> it increased by  <dig>  fold, as described previously  <cit> . interestingly, when the cells were treated with u <dig>  there was also a significant  increase in the level of bim mrna. this data indicates that in the presence of ngf the mek-erk pathway negatively regulates bim mrna expression in sympathetic neurons.

the mek-erk pathway negatively regulates bim mrna expression in sympathetic neurons via regulatory elements outside of the bim promoter, exon  <dig> and first intron
to determine the mechanism by which the mek-erk pathway negatively regulates bim expression in sympathetic neurons we investigated which region of the bim gene mediates this effect. initially, sympathetic neurons were microinjected with a bim-luc reporter construct to determine whether there are any mek-erk-responsive elements within the  <dig>  kb fragment of bim that is cloned in bim-luc. this construct contains  <dig>  kb of the bim promoter, the non-coding exon  <dig> and the  <dig>  kb first intron  <cit> . following injection, the cells were either maintained in medium containing ngf, withdrawn from ngf, or treated with either ly <dig>  or u <dig>  in the presence of ngf, and luciferase activity was determined after  <dig> hours . following ngf withdrawal, or treatment with ly <dig>  <cit> , bim-luc was activated significantly . however, when the cells were treated with u <dig> there was no increase in the activity of bim-luc . this suggests that there are no mek-erk-responsive elements within the first  <dig>  kb of the bim promoter, exon  <dig> or the first intron.

the bim 3' utr contains elements that are responsive to ngf withdrawal
our results indicate that the region that mediates the regulation of bim by the mek-erk pathway is not located at the 5' end of the bim gene. therefore we hypothesised that the bim 3' utr may contain the target region, since the 3' utr of a gene often contains a number of regulatory motifs that are important for modulating gene expression. these can include transcriptional enhancers or silencers, or sequences in the 3' utr of the mrna that are targeted by micrornas or bound by rna binding proteins that regulate mrna stability. initially, we mapped the 3' end of the rat bim mrna by 3' race. this indicated that the 3' utr is  <dig>  kb long. we then cloned the entire bim 3' utr into our bim-luc reporter construct, downstream of the luciferase gene, to generate the bim-luc+3'utr construct . to compare the bim-luc+3'utr construct to bim-luc, sympathetic neurons were microinjected with equimolar concentrations of bim-luc+3'utr or bim-luc, and either maintained in the presence of ngf or withdrawn from ngf for  <dig> hours, after which time luciferase activity was determined . we found that the addition of the 3' utr greatly reduced the basal level of the bim-luc construct in the presence of ngf, suggesting that the bim 3' utr contains sequences that reduce luciferase activity at the level of transcription, rna stability or translation. critically, addition of the 3' utr to the bim-luc reporter significantly increased its induction from  <dig>  fold to  <dig> fold, following ngf withdrawal . this demonstrates that the bim 3' utr contains elements that are responsive to ngf withdrawal. it is likely that the new bim-luc+3'utr construct is more representative of the endogenous bim gene than the original bim-luc construct since endogenous bim mrna levels increase by around  <dig> fold after ngf withdrawal .

the bim 3'utr is a target of the mek-erk pathway in sympathetic neurons
to ascertain whether the bim 3' utr is a target of the mek-erk pathway, sympathetic neurons were microinjected with bim-luc+3'utr or bim-luc and the cells were either maintained in medium containing ngf or treated with u <dig>  in the presence of ngf. after  <dig> hours, relative luciferase activity was determined . as demonstrated previously, inhibition of the mek-erk pathway with u <dig> did not activate the bim-luc construct . however, when bim-luc+3'utr was treated with u <dig> there was a significant activation of the reporter to  <dig>  fold . this suggests that the regulation of bim mrna level via the mek-erk-pathway is mediated by the 3' utr region of the bim gene.

inhibition of the mek-erk pathway does not alter bim mrna stability
since the mek-erk-responsive elements are located within the bim 3' utr, we decided to investigate whether u <dig> alters bim mrna stability. we used actinomycin-d to inhibit bim transcription and measured bim mrna levels over a time course with or without u <dig> . in the first set of experiments actinomycin-d  and u <dig>  were added to the cells together at time point  <dig>  and then total rna was isolated at time point  <dig> hours to  <dig> hours, as  <dig> hours is the time point at which the original effect of u <dig> was observed . the level of bim mrna was analysed by q-pcr relative to the level of the transcripts for the house-keeping genes hprt <dig> and gapdh. bim mrna levels relative to hprt <dig> are shown , since both house-keeping genes behaved in a similar way - neither was affected by the addition of u <dig> or actinomycin-d. following the addition of actinomycin-d, bim mrna decayed over the 16-hour time course in the absence of u <dig> . the half-life of rat bim mrna is between  <dig> and  <dig> hours in ngf-maintained sympathetic neurons treated with actinomycin-d . importantly, the addition of u <dig> did not significantly increase the stability of the bim mrna over the  <dig> hour time course . to be sure that this was a representative result, we performed a second experiment in which we pre-treated sympathetic neurons with u <dig> for  <dig> hours prior to the addition of actinomycin-d  . this would therefore rule out the possibility that actinomycin-d was interfering with the activity of u <dig>  however, the same result was obtained with no significant difference in the half life of the bim mrna in sympathetic neurons treated with or without u <dig> . this indicates that u <dig> does not increase bim mrna levels by altering mrna stability, in sympathetic neurons.

as a further control, we included a time course q-pcr experiment in which we compared cells treated with u <dig> and actinomycin-d to those treated with u <dig> only . we found that bim mrna levels increased over the  <dig> hour time course and were significantly higher,  <dig>  fold, at  <dig> hours following treatment with u <dig> compared to time point  <dig>  and that treatment with actinomycin-d abolished this up-regulation . furthermore, this data corroborates our initial finding that treatment with u <dig> for  <dig> hours significantly elevates the level of bim mrna in sympathetic neurons .

the mek1/2-erk1/ <dig> pathway negatively regulates bim mrna expression in sympathetic neurons
to investigate which of the mek-erk signalling pathways, mek1/2-erk1/ <dig> or mek5-erk <dig>  regulates bim mrna levels in sympathetic neurons we used a specific mek1/ <dig> inhibitor, pd <dig>  <cit> . to confirm that phospho-erk1/ <dig> levels are reduced when sympathetic neurons are treated with pd <dig>  immunoblots were performed with extracts from sympathetic neurons either maintained in ngf-containing medium or treated with increasing concentrations of pd <dig> in the presence of ngf . treatment of sympathetic neurons with pd <dig> at  <dig> μm strongly reduced the phosphorylation of erk <dig> and erk <dig>  whereas total erk protein levels were not altered . to ensure that pd <dig> specifically inhibits mek1/ <dig>  and does not interfere with mek5-erk <dig> signalling in sympathetic neurons, we repeated immunoblots on the pd184352-treated samples  with antibodies that detect phospho-erk <dig> and erk <dig> . ngf withdrawal reduced phosphorylation of erk <dig> and, as expected treatment of sympathetic neurons with pd <dig> at  <dig> μm in the presence of ngf did not affect the phosphorylation of erk <dig> and total erk  <dig> levels were not altered either .

we then performed q-pcr, as for figure 1e, including cdna prepared from sympathetic neurons treated with pd <dig> at  <dig> μm in the presence of ngf for  <dig> hours . the level of bim mrna was analysed relative to the level of the transcripts for the house-keeping genes hprt <dig> and gapdh . when sympathetic neurons were treated with pd <dig> there was a significant  increase in the level of bim mrna . this was a similar fold induction to that observed following treatment with u <dig> .

next, we microinjected sympathetic neurons with bim-luc+3'utr or bim-luc and the cells were either maintained in medium containing ngf or treated with pd <dig>  in the presence of ngf. after  <dig> hours, relative luciferase activity was determined . inhibition of the mek1/2-erk1/ <dig> pathway with pd <dig> did not activate the bim-luc construct, but significantly activated the bim-luc+3'utr construct by  <dig>  fold . taken together, this data confirms that the mek1/2-erk1/ <dig> pathway represses bim mrna levels through the bim 3'utr.

the mek-erk pathway contributes to cell survival in sympathetic neurons
finally, to determine whether inhibition of the prosurvival mek-erk pathway is sufficient to induce cell death in sympathetic neurons we studied the effect of u <dig> on cell viability over  <dig> hours . sympathetic neurons were either maintained in the presence of ngf, withdrawn from ngf or treated with u <dig>  in the presence of ngf. the cells were then fixed and stained with hoechst dye to visualise the nuclei and the number of cells with normal or pyknotic nuclei was determined at time point  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours. viable cells retained a normal nuclear morphology and were not pyknotic . at  <dig> hours, the percentage of viable cells maintained in the presence of ngf was over 95% , whereas only 78% of the cells treated with u <dig> had normal nuclei . this data indicates that the mek-erk pathway independently contributes to cell survival in ngf-treated sympathetic neurons.

discussion
by using the mek inhibitor u <dig>  we have demonstrated that the prosurvival mek-erk pathway represses bim mrna levels in sympathetic neurons through the 3' utr. this effect is independent of pi3-k-akt signalling and represses bim transcription in the presence of ngf .

after initially observing that the mek-erk pathway negatively regulates bim mrna expression in sympathetic neurons, we generated a bim-luc+3'utr reporter construct to investigate a potential role for the 3' utr in this mechanism. by microinjecting the bim-luc+3'utr construct into sympathetic neurons, we localised the region responsive to mek-erk signalling to the bim 3' utr. in addition, we found that the bim-luc+3'utr construct is a useful tool for studying bim regulation since it has a lower basal expression in the presence of ngf and an increased induction following ngf withdrawal. it may therefore be more representative of the endogenous bim gene, in comparison with our previous bim-luc reporter  <cit> .

to further investigate this mechanism, we studied bim mrna stability following treatment with or without u <dig>  since we found no significant effect upon the half life of the bim mrna following treatment with u <dig>  we concluded that mek/erk signalling does not affect bim mrna stability, and therefore may regulate bim mrna levels by a transcriptional mechanism. future studies will uncover potential cis-acting elements located in the bim 3' utr, such as enhancers or silencers that may bind dna-binding proteins that regulate transcription from the upstream bim promoter  <cit> . in principle, these regulators might be activators that are repressed by mek-erk signalling, or alternatively they could be repressors that are activated by the mek-erk pathway.

recently, other groups have reported a role for the bim 3' utr in modulating bim mrna levels. studies with baf- <dig> cells have revealed that bim mrna is stabilised when il <dig> is limiting and this regulation occurs via au-rich elements found within the bim 3' utr  <cit> . bim is also a target for regulation by mirnas: the bim 3' utr contains sequences targeted by mir-17~ <dig> micrornas and the conditional knockout of mir-17~ <dig> results in elevated bim levels and an inhibition of b cell development  <cit> . the bim mrna can also be targeted by mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  both of which are induced by ngf-stimulation in pc <dig> cells and this is linked to the mek1/2-erk1/ <dig> pathway  <cit> . however, all of these studies are associated with mrna stability and not transcription, so is unlikely that any of them account for the mechanism we have described here.

in sympathetic neurons both the mek1/2-erk1/ <dig> and the mek5-erk <dig> signalling pathways are stimulated in response to ngf and are activated downstream of ras  <cit> , and u <dig> inhibits both mek1/ <dig> and mek <dig>  <cit> . a number of reports have described the importance of mek1/2-erk1/ <dig> signalling in the post-translational control of the bim protein in different cell types  <cit> . the downstream events involved in mek5-erk <dig> signalling in neurons are less well defined, but it has been shown that erk <dig> can play an important role in neurotrophin-mediated survival, and deletion of the erk <dig> gene results in a significant increase in apoptosis in developing sympathetic neurons  <cit> . to determine which of the erk signalling pathways targets the 3' utr of the bim gene, we used the specific mek1/2-erk1/ <dig> inhibitor pd <dig>  <cit> . we found that this compound had similar effects to u <dig>  indicating that this mechanism of bim regulation largely depends on the mek1/2-erk1/ <dig> pathway in sympathetic neurons.

finally, we showed that inhibition of the prosurvival mek-erk pathway by treatment with u <dig> was sufficient to induce some neuronal death in the presence of ngf. however, it should be noted that the effect was modest compared to that observed following ngf deprivation. this is probably because the pi3-k-akt survival pathway is still active in cells treated with u <dig> .

CONCLUSIONS
it is now evident that a number of complex regulatory mechanisms are in place to constrain the expression and the activity of the proapoptotic bim protein. thus, using the well-characterised model of ngf-dependent developing sympathetic neurons, we have identified an additional mechanism by which bim mrna levels are regulated. we have shown that mek-erk signalling represses bim mrna levels through the bim 3' utr . since other reports investigating the function of the bim 3' utr in modulating bim mrna expression have focused on the role of mrna stability, it is likely that the mechanism we have identified here has not yet been studied in other cell types.
