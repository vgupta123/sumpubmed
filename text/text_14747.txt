BACKGROUND
the permeation of small molecules through the paracellular pathway in epithelial and endothelial cells is controlled by tight junctions, which constitute a continuous intercellular contact. the tight junction network, organized in strands, is formed by different proteins, among them zonula occludens  proteins, claudins, occludin and junctional adhesion molecules. although the regulation and the molecular composition of the tight junctions are far from being understood, it is generally accepted that claudins play a crucial role in tightening cell-cell contacts. the expression of claudins varies in different cell types and organs, and their protein-protein interactions which seal the paracellular space have been intensively discussed  <cit> . different members of the claudin family, in particular claudin- <dig> and - <dig>  are known to be receptor molecules of clostridium perfringens enterotoxin   <cit> ; the cooh-terminal part of this  <dig> kda protein has been shown to bind to the second extracellular loop of claudin- <dig>  <cit> . the minimum binding region of cpe has been narrowed down to the last  <dig> amino acids  <cit>  and deletion of the six c-terminal amino acids abolishes claudin-binding activity  <cit> .

the enrichment of proteins from a complex mixture is still a challenge, in particular when the target structures are at low abundance and/or are integral membrane proteins. moreover, one of the major concerns in affinity-based enrichment strategies is non-specific binding, which must be diminished or at least identified  <cit> . in addition to co-immunoprecipitation techniques  <cit> , there is increasing interest in applying recombinant proteins  <cit>  or protein domains  <cit>  for selectively enriching proteins; there are, however, only a few examples directed at tight junction proteins. a co-immunoprecipitation approach  has been applied for purification of the tight junction complex  <cit> . the interaction of zo- <dig> with α-actinin- <dig> has been demonstrated by a pull-down assay utilizing immobilization of recombinant pdz domains of this tight junction protein  <cit> .

the investigations presented here are aimed at extracting members of the claudin protein family from cell lysates, using a pull-down assay based on the affinity of cpe116– <dig> to the second extracellular loop of several claudins. the binding proteins are eluted, electrophoretically separated and identified by mass spectrometry . additionally, in combination with stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture   <cit> , it is investigated whether this approach allows the identification of proteins specifically associated with claudins and, consequently, with the tight junction complex.

methods
expression and purification of recombinant bait protein
the plasmid bearing clostridium perfringens enterotoxin -cdna  was kindly provided by y. horiguchi . to produce glutathione s-transferase -cpe, the dna-sequence of cpe116– <dig> was subcloned into ecori/sali sites in the pgex-4t- <dig> vector.

gst-cpe116– <dig> fusion protein and gst were expressed in e. coli . after induction, bacteria were grown to an optical density of  <dig>  ±  <dig>   and were harvested by centrifugation for  <dig> min at  <dig> × g. the pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer containing 1% triton x- <dig>   <dig>  mm phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride,  <dig> mm ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid  and protease inhibitor cocktail  in phosphate-buffered saline  and underwent two passages in an emulsiflex-c <dig> homogenizer . the insoluble cell debris was removed by centrifugation for  <dig> h at  <dig> × g. for purification of the recombinant proteins, the clarified supernatants were loaded onto columns containing glutathione-agarose under gravity flow. the resin was rinsed twice with washing buffer . gst-cpe116– <dig> and gst were eluted from the resin with elution buffer . the samples were dialyzed against pbs. protein concentrations were determined using the 2-d quant kit .

preparation of epithelial cell lysates
normal rat cholangiocytes , a gift of n.f. larusso, rochester, mn/usa, were cultured in  <dig> cm <dig> rat tail collagen-coated cell culture flasks in dmem/ham's f <dig> medium  with 5% co <dig> in air  <cit> . arginine- and lysine-deficient medium  was used for silac experiments, where one cell population was supplemented with arginine and lysine, whereas another cell population was grown in medium containing arginine and lysine. cells were grown to confluence, washed twice with ice-cold pbs to remove serum proteins and scraped in ice-cold pbs. the cell suspensions were centrifuged for  <dig> min at  <dig> × g; the pellets were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°c.

nrc cell pellets corresponding to four  <dig> cm <dig> cell culture flasks, prepared under either labeled or unlabeled conditions, were resuspended in  <dig> ml lysis buffer . cells were homogenized using a syringe and a 24-gauge needle. after incubation on ice for  <dig> min, the cell extract was cleared by centrifugation for  <dig> min at  <dig> × g.

affinity purification
glutathione-sepharose™ 4b beads  were washed with cold pbs before use. equal amounts of gst-cpe116– <dig>  or gst were rotated with beads for  <dig> h at 4°c. after three washing steps with pbs containing 1% triton x- <dig>  the beads loaded with gst-cpe116– <dig> were incubated with the lysate of labeled cells for  <dig> h at 4°c. as a control, beads were loaded with gst and rotated in the lysate of unlabeled cells for the same period of time. in addition, a corresponding inverse experiment  was carried out. non-specifically bound proteins were diminished by rinsing the beads three times with a washing buffer . bound proteins were eluted with  <dig> μl of elution buffer  in two steps. beads were incubated in elution buffer for  <dig> min at 4°c. both eluates were pooled.

immunoblotting
proteins were separated by 15% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. after blocking with 5% nonfat milk in tris-buffered saline with tween- <dig> , the membranes were washed three times in tbst. membranes were incubated at 4°c overnight with monoclonal antibodies to either claudin- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  or - <dig> , diluted in tbst. after washing three times in tbst, the immunoblots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit  secondary antibody  for  <dig> h at room temperature. the membranes were washed for at least  <dig> min, exchanging tbst every  <dig> min, and signals were visualized by horseradish peroxidase-dependent chemiluminescence . for sphingosine kinase  <dig>  immunoprecipitation,  <dig> μg of the primary monoclonal antibody  were added to  <dig> μl of nrc lysate  and incubated for  <dig> h at 4°c. subsequently,  <dig> μl of resuspended protein a/g plus agarose  were added and incubated for  <dig> h at 4°c. as a control,  <dig> μl of protein a/g plus agarose were incubated with  <dig> μl of nrc lysate for  <dig> h at 4°c. immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation at  <dig> × g for  <dig> min at 4°c. the pellet was washed twice with 1% and once with  <dig> % triton x- <dig> in pbs, each time repeating the centrifugation step. after the final wash, the pellet was resuspended in  <dig> μl electrophoresis sample buffer . samples were heated for  <dig> min at 40°c and analyzed by sds-page and immunoblotting.

identification and quantitation of proteins by mass spectrometry
the eluates from the gst-cpe116– <dig> and the control gst pull-down were combined at a ratio of 1: <dig>  resolved by sds-page  and stained with coomassie brilliant blue g- <dig>  excised gel slices were washed with 50%  acetonitrile in  <dig> mm ammonium bicarbonate, shrunk by dehydration in acetonitrile, and dried in a vacuum centrifuge. the dried pieces were reswollen in  <dig> μl of  <dig> mm ammonium bicarbonate containing  <dig> ng trypsin . after  <dig> h incubation at 37°c,  <dig> μl of  <dig> % trifluoroacetic acid  in acetonitrile were added, and the separated supernatant was dried under vacuum. for nanolc-ms/ms, the samples were dissolved in  <dig> μl of  <dig> %  tfa, 5%  acetonitrile in water.

tandem ms experiments were performed on a quadrupole orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight mass spectrometer q-tof ultima , equipped with a liquid chromatography system , as previously described  <cit> . in brief, lc-separations were performed on a capillary column  at an eluent flow rate of  <dig> nl/min, using an acetonitrile gradient in  <dig> % formic acid . ms/ms data were acquired in a data-dependent mode, using ms survey scanning followed by ms/ms of the most abundant peak. data analysis was performed with masslynx version  <dig>  software .

the processed ms/ms spectra and mascot server  were used to search in-house against the swissprot protein database. the maximum of two missed cleavages was allowed and the mass tolerance of precursor and sequence ions was set to  <dig> ppm and  <dig>  da, respectively. acrylamide modification of cysteine, methionine oxidation, 13c6-arginine and 13c6-lysine were considered as possible modifications. a protein was accepted as identified if the total mascot score was greater than the significance threshold and at least two peptides appeared for the first time in the report and these peptides were first ranking. protein identifications were performed at a < 1% false positive rate as established by decoy database search strategy.

quantitation was based on calculations of isotope intensity ratios of at least two arginine- or lysine-containing tryptic peptides that were identified by ms/ms with a score above the mascot identity threshold. additional criteria were that no interfering mass peaks were observed, that the peptide appeared for the first time in the report and that it was a first ranking peptide.

RESULTS
tight junction proteins, their homophilic and heterophilic interactions and their regulation, are of outstanding importance for the function of many organs. the present study is devoted to the claudin protein family, as its members play a decisive role in providing paracellular tightness. based on their affinity to cpe116– <dig>  enrichment of different claudins from cell lysates has been accomplished. co-enriched proteins have been identified and their potential interaction with claudins assessed.

several epithelial cell lines were tested initially, and normal rat cholangiocytes were selected for subsequent experiments, as higher levels of cpe-binding claudins - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> were detected by immunoblotting when compared to the human colon carcinoma cell line caco- <dig>  however, it should be mentioned that the ms identification of the proteins eluted from gst-cpe116– <dig> after incubation with caco- <dig> lysates indicated that claudin- <dig> and claudin- <dig> also accumulate in this fraction .

in preceding experiments, different protocols were tested with respect to the enrichment of claudins. a huge number of non-specifically bound proteins were identified by mass spectrometry in a protein fraction obtained by a co-immunoprecipitation experiment using a monoclonal claudin- <dig> antibody . moreover, the data indicated lower relative enrichment of claudin- <dig> than with the cpe-based approach and the lack of any claudin different from claudin- <dig>  thus, another advantage of enrichment using cpe is its high affinity to several members of the claudin family.

the scheme shown in fig.  <dig> specifies the protocol applied for affinity chromatographic enrichment of claudins and subsequent ms identification of co-eluted proteins. as initial experiments revealed relatively strong non-specific binding to various carrier materials, a protein labeling strategy  was employed in order to define proteins non-specifically bound to gst and/or matrix. cell lysates containing labeled proteins were added to cpe116–319-loaded gst fusion protein, whereas the non-labeled protein fraction was added to the unloaded control . in nrc cells, the degree of 13c-arg and 13c-lys labeling was 90% .

the experimental procedures were optimized with respect to the amount of claudins enriched in the eluate fractions. different detergents were tested to improve the solubilization of claudins in the lysate and eluate fractions; fig.  <dig> gives a comparison of the recovery of claudin- <dig> and claudin- <dig> in lysis buffers containing triton x- <dig> and 3--1-propanesulfonate . triton x- <dig> was selected for further experiments, as higher yields of the claudins were found both in the lysate- and in the gst-cpe116– <dig> eluate fraction. corresponding experimental conditions have also been successfully used in a study on the self-association of tight junction proteins  <cit> .

immunoblots against claudins of the different flow-through and eluate fractions clearly demonstrate the strong enrichment of claudins - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> in the gst-cpe116– <dig> eluate fraction . the blots of the eluate fractions of the gst controls show a faint signal originating from claudin- <dig> and a stronger signal of claudin- <dig>  possibly indicating weak association of these claudins with gst and/or matrix material.

the c-terminal part of cpe  is sufficient for interactions with claudin- <dig> and claudin- <dig>  <cit> . neither claudin- <dig> nor claudin- <dig> were detected by immunoblotting in a control affinity enrichment applying a truncated  construct . it has been reported  <cit>  that tight junction strands gradually disintegrate and disappear from the cell surface after treatment with the toxin. however, despite its high affinity interaction with claudins, opening of the tight junctions by cpe treatment needs hours  <cit>  which corresponds with our observation  that a significantly lower amount of claudin- <dig> is precipited with cpe116– <dig> when the construct is incubated with intact cell monolayers instead of lysates.

for ms analysis, the eluted gst and gst-cpe116– <dig> fractions were mixed at a 1: <dig> ratio, separated by sds-page, and in-gel digested. for the identified proteins, the degree of binding specificity is given by the value r, defined here as the mean of the ms peak intensity ratios  of peptides originating from cpe116–319- and control fraction. table  <dig> lists the proteins identified in at least two independent experiments with r ≥  <dig> . in accordance with the immunoblotting data, the highest ratios were obtained for the claudins. high association constants  with cpe have been published for claudin- <dig> and - <dig>  <cit> , as well as for claudin- <dig>  <cit> . claudin- <dig> and claudin- <dig>  do not bind to cpe according to the literature  <cit> . the unambiguous identification of these claudins by immunoblotting  could be explained either by binding to cpe116– <dig> or by a linkage to other cpe-binding proteins. there are indeed literature data reporting interaction of claudins - <dig> and - <dig> in co-expression studies  <cit> , and the association of claudin- <dig> and claudin- <dig> was demonstrated in transfected cell lines and human airway epithelium  <cit> . additional experiments performed in either claudin-3- or claudin-5-transfected hek <dig> cells revealed an association of claudin- <dig>  but not claudin- <dig>  to cpe116– <dig> under the experimental conditions applied here . ongoing investigations will clarify the molecular basis of the specific enrichment of claudin- <dig> and - <dig> in the gst-cpe116– <dig> fraction.

each protein was identified in at least two of three independent experiments . an, uniprotkb/swissprot protein accession number; mwapp, apparent molecular weight  according to position in gel; mw, molecular weight  according to uniprotkb/swissprot; sc, protein  score ; n, highest number of peptides identified in individual experiment; r, ratio between ms peak intensities of peptides originating from gst-cpe116– <dig> and gst elution fractions; comment, cellular component according to uniprotkb/swissprot ; #, protein fragment

in addition to heterologous claudin-claudin interactions, claudins associate with zo- <dig>  <cit>  and possibly tetraspanins  <cit> . however, neither of these proteins was found by ms  in the gst-cpe116– <dig> fraction. except for the claudins, the vast majority of proteins found to be enriched in the gst-cpe116– <dig> fraction are of nuclear or mitochondrial origin. among the proteins identified to co-elute with the claudins, the most specific association with the cpe construct was observed for dna-directed rna polymerase ii. interestingly, at least one other protein was identified which can be bound to this polymerase . however, the interaction of this nuclear protein with the cpe complex is, although specific, thought to be a false positive , since it is likely to be favored by the disintegration of cellular structures given in cell lysates. this type of interaction must also be assumed for other proteins, e.g., mitochondrial proteins, which are strictly separated in vivo from the plasma membrane. the function known so far for ran-binding protein  <dig>  and rangtpase-activating protein  <dig>  are related to nucleocytoplasmic transport, also suggesting a false positive interaction. both rbp <dig> and rangap <dig> are substrates of post-translational modification by small ubiquitin-like modifier  <dig>   <cit> , which was also identified. moreover, rangap <dig> and sumo- <dig> were found at an apparent molecular mass of  <dig> kda in the same gel slice as the only proteins with r >  <dig>  indicating that rangap <dig> is the protein sumoylated here.

the cytosolic localization of sphingosine kinase  <dig> could facilitate association with intracellular parts of claudins . moreover, a connection exists between sphingosine kinase  <dig> and the junctional complex: sphingosine 1-phosphate  induces in endothelial cells the formation of zo- <dig> complexes with cortactin and α-catenin, which regulate chemotactic response and barrier integrity, respectively  <cit> . additional experiments have therefore been performed to check for a possible interaction of claudins with sphingosine kinase  <dig>  the immunoblot given in fig.  <dig>  demonstrates enrichment of sphk <dig> in the gst-cpe116– <dig> fraction, although a lower amount of the protein was also found in the respective gst control. co-immunoprecipation using a monoclonal antibody directed against sphk <dig> revealed strong enrichment of sphk <dig> in the eluate fraction . however, co-immunoprecipitation of claudins with sphk <dig> was not detectable, neither for claudin- <dig>  nor for claudins - <dig>  - <dig> or - <dig> . moreover, immunofluorescence staining did not provide any evidence for co-localization of sphk <dig> and claudins in nrc cells .

CONCLUSIONS
the present study introduces a new approach directed at enriching the cpe-binding claudins. the proteins interacting specifically with gst-cpe116– <dig> include not only claudins - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> , but also claudins - <dig> and - <dig>  pointing at a possible indirect heterologous association of these tight junction proteins. different proteins  were shown to co-elute from the gst-cpe116– <dig> complex, but there is no indication that any of these proteins plays a role with respect to tight junctions or cell-cell contacts. simultaneous enrichment of numerous claudins may nevertheless provide a useful tool applicable to further investigations devoted to these tight junctional proteins.
