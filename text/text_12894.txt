BACKGROUND
efficient utilization of all available carbon from lignocellulosic feedstock presents a major barrier to economical biofuel production  <cit> . xylose is the second predominant sugar in lignocellulosic feedstock after glucose. however, saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is ubiquitously employed in ethanol production, cannot naturally metabolize xylose. consequently, throughout the past few decades, the introduction of xylose metabolic pathways into s. cerevisiae has been extensively researched  <cit> . two pathways have been studied widely for d-xylose utilization. in fungi and xylose-metabolic yeasts, d-xylose is reduced to xylitol by nadh-dependent xylose reductase , encoded by xyl <dig> and xylitol is then oxidized to d-xylulose by nad+-dependent xylitol dehydrogenase , encoded by xyl <dig> <cit> . the resulting d-xylulose is converted to xylulose-5-phosphate by endogenous xylulose kinase . alternatively, some bacteria and fungi can directly convert d-xylose to xylulose via the cofactor-independent xylose isomerase  pathway. both pathways have been successfully introduced into s. cerevisiae, allowing the recombinant strains to produce ethanol from xylose   <cit> . xylose metabolism has been improved by over-expressing the endogenous xylulose kinase genes and the genes involved in the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway  <cit> .

introducing the scheffersomyces stipitis xr-xdh pathway into s. cerevisiae has enabled the yeast to effectively utilize xylose  <cit> . our previous work also demonstrated efficient xylose uptake by strains expressing this pathway  <cit> . however, the different cofactor dependence of xr and xdh leads to cofactor imbalance and xylitol accumulation. recent studies have focused on metabolic engineering to balance intracellular cofactor levels or on modifying the cofactor specificities of xr or xdh to establish an oxidation-reduction cycle  <cit> . several strategies have been implemented for balancing intracellular cofactors in recombinant s. cerevisiae. these include manipulating ammonia assimilation from being nadph dependent to being nadh dependent by replacing gdh <dig>  with gdh <dig> , expressing the kluyveromyces lactis gdp <dig> gene, which encodes a fungal nadp+-dependent d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, expressing the gapn gene from streptococcus mutants, which encodes a non-phosphorylating nadp+-dependent gapdh, and over-expressing the truncated pos <dig> gene, which encodes cytosolic nadh kinase  <cit> .

an alternative pathway for xylose catabolism is the isomerase-based pathway. this pathway is cofactor independent, and therefore could lead to higher theoretical ethanol yields. however, only a few xylose isomerase genes have been successfully expressed in s. cerevisiae, derived from organisms such as piromyces sp. <cit> , orpinomyces sp. <cit> , clostridium phytofermentans <cit>  and prevotella ruminicola <cit> . further engineering strategies, such as adaptive evolutionary engineering  <cit>  and over-expressing downstream pathways  <cit> , have been implemented to improve xylose consumption and cell growth.

recently, we obtained a new xi  gene from bovine rumen. the activity of this xi in s. cerevisiae was slightly higher than the xi from piromyces sp. <cit> . we also engineered the host strain to over-express the endogenous xylulose kinase gene  and the genes in non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, eliminating the respiration by deleting cytochrome c oxidase subunit iv encoding gene cox <dig>  and adaptive evolution  <cit> . the recombinant strain showed high xylose metabolism capability and high ethanol yield under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. however, although no xylitol was accumulated, substantial amounts of glycerol were produced as the major byproduct  <cit> .

in industrial ethanol processes, up to 4% of the sugar feedstock is converted into glycerol by s. cerevisiae, which is an unwanted loss of carbon source  <cit> . glycerol synthesis plays important roles in yeast osmoregulation and in regulating intracellular redox balance  <cit> . it is produced from dihydroxyacetone phosphate  through the catalysis of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  and glycerol-3-phosphate phosphatase . researchers have expended considerable effort in minimizing glycerol formation. one approach is to delete one or both of gpd <dig> and gpd <dig> as well as the genes involved in glycerol transport, such as fps <dig> <cit> . because cells lacking the gpd <dig> and gpd <dig> genes cannot grow anaerobically, the promoter of gpd <dig> has been engineered in gpd <dig> deletion background  <cit> . alternative approaches aim at manipulating the redox cofactor metabolism to reduce cytosolic nadh accumulation  <cit> . for example, nissen et al. deleted gdh <dig> , while overexpressing gln <dig> and glt <dig> . their engineered strains demonstrated reduced glycerol yield and increased ethanol yield  <cit> . guo et al. simultaneously deleted gpd <dig> and introduced the non-phosphorylating nadp+-dependent gapdh gene gapn into strains overexpressing the trehalose synthesis genes tps <dig> and tps <dig>  thereby obtaining a high ethanol-yielding strain  <cit> . zhang et al. combined the expression of nadp+-dependent gapdh gene gapn with either a nad+-dependent fumarate reductase gene frda, or an acetylating nad+-dependent acetaldehyde dehydrogenase for reoxidizing nadh  <cit> .

water-forming nadh oxidase can oxidize cytosolic nadh to nad+, accompanied by a reduction of o <dig> to h2o, when oxygen is available. previous studies have demonstrated the capability of nadh oxidase expression to reduce xylitol production during xylose metabolism  <cit> , but in this approach, aerobic cultivation combined with oxygen-limited fermentation has to be performed to supply oxygen for nadh oxidase, which results in low ethanol production. however, if the ethanol yield is enhanced by purely anaerobic cultivation, the nadh oxidase reaction is deprived of its required oxygen. in our previous work, we demonstrated that respiration-deficient xylose-metabolizing strains can efficiently produce ethanol from xylose and glucose under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions  <cit> . therefore, in the present study, we expressed water-forming nadh oxidase derived from lactococcus lactis in our respiration-deficient xylose-metabolizing strains . the fermentation process is aerobically controlled to supply oxygen for nadh oxidase without compromising ethanol production. the impact on byproduct accumulation and ethanol production was studied in both recombinant xi strains and recombinant xr-xdh strains. to decrease the byproduct accumulation without affecting yeast growth and sugar metabolism, different nadh oxidase expression levels were compared by expressing the noxe gene controlled by different promoters in the 2 μ or centromeric plasmids under glucose and xylose co-cultivation conditions.

RESULTS
nadh oxidase expression decreases glycerol production in recombinant xi strains
as mentioned previously, glycerol is the main byproduct of xylose metabolism in recombinant xi strains  <cit> . we therefore aimed to suppress glycerol production by expressing the nadh oxidase gene. two different nadh oxidase expression levels were selected under the control of either the tef <dig> or gpd <dig> promoter in the 2 μ plasmid. the relative transcription of noxe in xitn was about  <dig> fold higher than that in xign . the specific enzyme activities of nadh oxidase in xitn and xign were  <dig>  and  <dig>  u mg- <dig> protein, respectively . as a consequence of nadh oxidase expression, the intracellular nadh/nad+ ratio decreased by 67% and 23% in xitn and xign, respectively, relative to xico .

we then studied the impact of nadh oxidase expression on glucose and xylose co-cultivations. as shown in figure  <dig> and table  <dig>  expressing nadh oxidase under the strong constitutive tef <dig> promoter in the 2 μ plasmid completely suppressed glycerol production, but also significantly reduced glucose and xylose metabolism, and decreased the ethanol yield by about 17% . this may be because the strong nadh oxidase expression in xitn depleted the pool of nadh . when nadh oxidase was regulated by the gpd <dig> promoter in the 2 μ plasmid, the glycerol yield reduced by 84% in xign, while the ethanol yield and specific growth rate increased by 8% and 12%, respectively . the biomass yield also increased slightly, without significantly affecting the xylose consumption. these results show that expressing nadh oxidase under the control of the gpd <dig> promoter in recombinant xi strains can effectively reduce glycerol production and increase the ethanol yield.

nadh oxidase expression decreases xylitol and glycerol accumulation in recombinant xr-xdh strains
we also investigated the effect of nadh oxidase expression in recombinant xr-xdh strains . controlling nadh oxidase expression under the gpd <dig> promoter was much less effective than in the recombinant xi strains; the glycerol and xylitol yields were reduced by only 50% and 15%, respectively . this suggested that the nadh oxidation level in xrgn was not sufficiently high to suppress byproduct accumulation. however, increased expression under the tef <dig> promoter led to a large reduction of ethanol yield and inhibited glucose or xylose consumption, indicating that nadh oxidation level in xrtn were prohibitively high . therefore, we introduced two medium levels of noxe expression, under the control of the hxk <dig> promoter in the 2 μ plasmid  and the tef <dig> promoter in the centromeric plasmid . the transcription levels of the noxe gene and the specific enzyme activities of nadh oxidase were then compared. the relative transcriptions of noxe in xitn and xrhn were about  <dig> fold and  <dig> fold higher than in xrtn <dig>  respectively, while the relative transcription of noxe in xign was slightly lower than in xrtn <dig> . the specific enzyme activities of nadh oxidase in xrtn, xrhn, xrtn <dig> and xign were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  u mg- <dig> protein respectively . relative to xrco, the intracellular nadh/nad+ ratio decreased by 66%, 39%, 33% and 21% in xrtn, xrhn, xrtn <dig> and xrgn, respectively, when nadh oxidase was expressed .

as shown in figure  <dig>  although glycerol and xylitol accumulation was completely prevented in xrhn, the specific xylose consumption rate was 35% lower than in the control strain xrco . however, in strain xrtn <dig>  the glycerol yield and xylitol accumulation were reduced by 83% and 60% respectively, but the specific xylose consumption rate was 21% lower than in xrco . relative to the control strain, byproduct formation was reduced in strain xrtn <dig> without significantly affecting xylose metabolism. however, none of the recombinant strains improved the ethanol yield relative to xrco. this indicates that, although nadh oxidase decreased glycerol and xylitol production in recombinant xr-xdh strains, it did not increase the ethanol production in recombinant xr-xdh pathway strains.

discussion
in the presence of oxygen, water-forming nadh oxidase can oxidize cytosolic nadh to nad+, with simultaneous reduction of o <dig> to h2o. although nadh oxidase expression is known to reduce xylitol production during xylose metabolism, it requires aerobic cultivation combined with oxygen-limited fermentation; otherwise the enzyme cannot function  <cit> . however, aerobic cultivation reduces ethanol production. our respiratory-deficient strain can efficiently generate ethanol from aerobic glucose and xylose cultivations. as such, it provides a solid platform for nadh oxidase expression  <cit> .

during the catabolism of glucose or xylose through the xi pathway, s. cerevisiae yields a surplus of cytosolic nadh, mainly through biosynthesis of proteins, nucleic acids and lipids  <cit> . although cytosolic nadh is required for converting acetaldehyde to ethanol, ethanol production is a redox-neutral process, hence does not contribute to surplus nadh oxidation. the additional nadh generated from catabolism is oxidized via the mitochondrial electron transport chain and glycerol production. in the recombinant xr-xdh strains, the cofactor imbalance between xr and xdh and the increase in cytosolic nadh generated by xdh lead to xylitol accumulation and low ethanol conversion. the difference in cytosolic nadh accumulation between these two situations alters the requirement for nadh oxidase. indeed, we observed that the recombinant xr-xdh strains required higher nadh oxidase expression than the recombinant xi strain to eliminate glycerol and xylitol.

glycerol production is consequent to accumulation of excess nadh in the cytosol  <cit> . the glycerol formation reaction is mediated by glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase . gpd1p is involved in osmosensing and regulation, while gpd2p is responsible for reoxidation of excess cytosolic nadh  <cit> . when nadh oxidase is expressed under the control of the gpd <dig> promoter, the enzyme competes to oxidize excess nadh that is normally reoxidized by glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase during glycerol production. therefore, nadh oxidase could be fine-tuned in strain xign to eliminate glycerol production without draining the nadh pool. conversely, when nadh oxidase was expressed under the control of the gpd <dig> promoter in the recombinant xr-xdh strains, the excess cytosolic nadh production reduced the effect of the enzyme. consequently, the expressed nadh oxidase was insufficient to eliminate both xylitol and glycerol, and higher expression was necessary. although xylitol and glycerol production was completely inhibited in the xrhn , xylose consumption by this strain was decreased by 35% relative to the control strain. xrtn <dig>  demonstrated lower nadh oxidase activity than xrhn, and yielded low xylitol and glycerol levels without significantly compromising xylose consumption. however, xylose metabolism was decreased by 21% in this strain and some xylitol accumulation was observed. this indicates that nadh oxidase expression in xrtn <dig> was insufficient to eliminate byproducts, but was sufficiently high to affect substrate metabolism.

comparing the optimal modified strains in both pathways, the recombinant xi strain xign accumulated little byproduct, and demonstrated a higher xylose consumption rate and ethanol yield than the recombinant xr-xdh strain xrtn <dig>  therefore, the performance of the recombinant xi strain surpassed that of the recombinant xr-xdh strain. additionally, our recombinant rumen xi strains xign performed similarly to an s. cerevisiae strain expressing piromyces sp. xyla <cit>  in terms of ethanol production, but accumulated considerably less glycerol. consequently, the recombinant xi strain emerges as a preferable choice for lignocellulosic feedstock utilization.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we investigated the impact of nadh oxidase on two xylose metabolism pathways: the cofactor independent xi pathway and the cofactor dependent xr and xdh pathway. according to our results, nadh oxidase expression decreases glycerol and xylitol accumulation in respiration-deficient xylose-metabolizing s. cerevisiae. by controlling the promoter strength of noxe gene and the plasmid copy number, we obtained an efficient xylose-metabolizing strain that accumulated little byproduct. such fine-tuned cofactor engineering is an attractive strategy for bioprocessing, and is applicable to production of other redox dependent metabolites.
