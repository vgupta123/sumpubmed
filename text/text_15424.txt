BACKGROUND
the global market for biopharmaceuticals is currently  <dig> billion usd of which the majority of proteins requiring post-translational modifications are produced in chinese hamster ovary  cells  <cit> . cho cells have a long history as a production organism in industry due to their ability to grow in suspension without serum and to be scalable to large production volumes. furthermore, cho cells are able to produce proteins with a glycosylation pattern similar to that of humans  <cit>  and are not infected by a wide range of viruses dangerous to humans  <cit> . so far more than  <dig> biopharmaceuticals including monoclonal antibodies, hormones, cytokines and blood-coagulation factors have been produced in cho cells.

the cho cell line was originally isolated in  <dig> by t. puck  <cit>  and ten years later the cho-k <dig> cell line was derived from this ancestral host  <cit> . in order to facilitate creation of stable cell lines producing a gene of interest a selection system was needed. the cho dxb <dig> cell line was created with the goal of developing a stable cho cell line with a dhfr negative phenotype as dhfr can catalyze the conversion of dihydrofolic acid to tetrahydrofolic acid – an essential cofactor carrier. cho-k <dig> cells were first exposed to a round of random chemical mutagenesis using ethyl methanesulfonate  to generate the ukb <dig> cell line   <cit>  followed by a second round of mutagenesis using γ-radiation before isolation of the cho dxb <dig> cell line   <cit> . the dxb <dig> cell line was not mentioned by name in the original paper  <cit>  and the name was not published until  <dig> where the gene structure was more thoroughly investigated  <cit> . during the period between these two papers other laboratories used the cell line under the names cho k <dig> dux-b <dig>  <cit>  and dukx-cho  <cit> , explaining the origin of other names commonly used to describe the cho dxb <dig> cell line. further details concerning the clonal history of the cho cell lines can be found in a recent review  <cit> . historically, cho dxb <dig> was the first cho host cell for large scale production of a protein product  and it is still being used for production of several protein products on the market.

recently the genomic sequence of the chinese hamster   <cit>  and seven cho cell lines  <cit>  were released making genomic comparisons of cho cells possible for the first time. the first attempt to analyze the genomic information of the cho dxb <dig> cell line was done in  <dig> when wlaschin et al. extracted  <dig> expressed sequencing tags from cho dxb <dig> rna in order to create a cho specific cdna microarray  <cit> . this work furthermore lead to sequencing of the cho mitochondrial genome. a 1x coverage of the genome of a cho dxb <dig> transfectant producing human secreted alkaline phosphatase was released back in  <dig>  <cit>  the same year as the cho-k <dig> atcc sequence was made public  <cit> . they furthermore reported that the dhfr-gene was detected albeit showing low coverage.

in this work, the genome of the cho dxb <dig> cell line was sequenced with the goal of making this genome publicly available alongside the list of previously sequenced cho genomes  <cit> . the genome was analyzed in order to validate the genomic cause of the dhfr negative phenotype of the cell line and the overall genome composition was compared to the currently sequenced cho genomes. we found unique patterns for the evolution of each of the chromosomes from the chinese hamster to each of the cho cell lines and a surprising degree of haploidy.

RESULTS
sequencing depth per gene predicts gene haploidy and polyploidy
in order to gain insight into the genotype of the industrially relevant cell line cho dxb <dig>  as well as addressing some of the genomic consequences associated with creating a stable cho transfectant the two genomes were sequenced. genomic dna was extracted from adherently growing cho dxb <dig> cells as well as f <dig> cells, which is cho dxb <dig> cells transfected with the gene encoding coagulation factor viii  <cit>  and subsequently adapted to suspension culture growth. both cell lines were sequenced using the illumina hiseq  <dig> platform yielding  <dig>  bn paired reads for cho dxb <dig> and  <dig>  bn reads for f <dig>  the reads were aligned to the chinese hamster genome with a median depth of 33x and 17x respectively. the sequencing depth in cho dxb <dig> for each of the  <dig> genes found in the c. griseus genome were calculated and plotted, showing distinct peaks at sequencing depths of 0x, 16x, 33x and 49x coverage corresponding to a copy number in the genome of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> copies . the dhfr gene was found at a depth of  <dig>  in the cho-k <dig> atcc genome,  <dig> in the cho dg <dig> genome,  <dig>  in the f <dig> genome and  <dig>  in the cho dxb <dig> genome in accordance with one allele being lost by gamma radiation in cho dxb <dig> . seven other genes found flanking dhfr on the same scaffold are also seen to be present in only one copy in the genomes of cho dxb <dig> and f <dig>  the dhfr gene from the remaining allele is found to be transcribed as seen from rna sequencing data from f <dig>  but contain a homozygous g410c point mutation located in the dhfr coding region causing a thr137arg missense mutation. this threonine is conserved from c. elegans to mouse, rat, hamster and human. in the crystal structure of murine dhfr  <cit>   the threonine is found in the cleft binding dihydrofolic acid right next to the active site, thus supporting the hypothesis that this mutation is able to effectively inactivate dhfr. in the process of deleting dhfr in the cho dg <dig> genome it is found that four of the flanking genes were deleted  .figure  <dig>

a significant drift in single nucleotide polymorphisms is observed
in addition to the single nucleotide polymorphism  found in the dhfr gene, a total of  <dig> , <dig> snps were found in the cho dxb <dig> genome when aligned to the c. griseus genome . for the cho-k <dig> atcc genome a higher total number of snps were detected but more snps were found in the coding regions of the cho dxb <dig> genome . 91% of the mutations interfering with translation in cho-k <dig> atcc were also found in cho dxb <dig>  all snps found in cho-k <dig> atcc and cho dxb <dig> genes are listed in additional file 1: tables s <dig> and s <dig> table  <dig>

by comparing all the snps from the available cho genomes to that of c. griseus a significant drift favoring gc → at point mutations is evident for the two cho dxb <dig> cell lines compared to the four sequenced cho-k <dig> cell lines , probably caused by the chemical mutagen used in the creation of the cho dxb <dig> cell line. however, different snp biases were seen for cho dg <dig> and cho-s/c <dig> respectively probably due to the distinct evolution of these cell lines .

copy number variation signature is chromosome dependent
by comparing the sequencing read depth for each gene from the cho-k <dig> atcc to the cho dxb <dig> genome, it is seen that 96% of the genes are found in similar depths in both cell lines as expected, following the diagonal of the plot in figure  <dig>  no genes are observed to be deleted in the cho-k <dig> atcc genome but present in the cho dxb <dig> genome as expected due to the origin of the cho dxb <dig> cell line from cho-k <dig>  however, a total of  <dig> genes are seen to have reduced copy numbers in the cho dxb <dig> genome compared to the cho-k <dig> atcc genome, whereas  <dig> genes have increased copy number. the copy number data for the cho-k <dig> atcc and the cho dxb <dig> genome were furthermore mapped to the individual chromosomes of c. griseus  revealing a unique signature for each chromosome differing from the signature of the genome as a whole. it was not possible to separate chromosome nine from chromosome ten when sequencing the c. griseus genome and for this reason these two are listed together  <cit> . on chromosome two, where dhfr is situated,  <dig> genes have been reduced from diploid to haploid. reductions are furthermore seen on chromosome five, six and seven. on chromosome three  <dig> genes are found to be triploid in cho dxb <dig> versus diploid in cho-k <dig> atcc.figure  <dig>

by estimating the extent of copy number variations  between the currently sequenced cho cell lines, a phylogenetic tree can be drawn, which accurately recapitulates the overall cell line history  <cit>  . a heat map showing the extent of genes found to have reduced copy numbers between the different cell lines reveal specific patterns for each chromosome . from this, it can be seen that each chromosome is shown to have evolved differently across the cell lines and exhibits unique patterns. on chromosome 9/ <dig>  ~70% of the genes have been reduced from diploid in c. griseus to haploid in all cell lines except for c <dig>  cho-s and f <dig> where only ~50% of the genes are haploid . chromosome x is seen to contain only 9% haploid genes in cho-s whereas ~70% of the genes on this chromosome are found to be haploid in cho dg <dig>  chromosome five appears to have undergone changes especially in f <dig>  and in dg <dig>  . chromosomes one and four seem to be the most stable chromosomes for all the cho cell lines. overview of the number of genes found to be deleted, haploid, diploid or amplified in each genome are listed in table  <dig> figure  <dig>

in addition to chromosome specific changes in copy number it was investigated whether specific gene functions were seen to be enriched among genes with cnv’s.  <dig> gene ontology  terms were found to be significantly enriched with either amplified for reduced genes compared to c. griseus. the go-terms were found to be conserved among all nine cho cell lines . the 3rd most significant go-function were genes with transcription factor activity where cho dxb <dig> and f <dig> had amplification of  <dig> and  <dig> genes respectively out of  <dig>  whereas the other  <dig> cho cell lines have 27 ±  <dig> genes amplified in this category. in the same category cho dg <dig> were found to have  <dig> genes which had been reduced in copy number where the remaining eight cell lines had 16 ±  <dig> genes reduced.

discussion
the genetic drift of snps from c. griseus to cho dxb <dig> exhibited a significant disparity compared to the drift from c. griseus to the four cho-k <dig> cell lines. the drift can likely be explained by the fact that the cho dxb <dig> cell line was treated with the chemical mutagen ems. the ethyl group of ems is able to alkylate guanine forming o-6-ethylguanine which during replication commonly is paired with thymine and not cytosine  <cit> . thus, an increased number of gc → at mutations are expected and found in the genome of this cell line. it was seen that dhfr contained a missense mutation as well as the loss of an allele. these findings confirm observations by lawrence chasin in  <dig> . the threonine on position  <dig>  which is mutated into an arginine in dxb <dig>  is not found in any of the annotated domains of the protein but is found to be highly conserved. the amino acid is located close to the active site and it can thus be hypothesized that the polar arginine is able to interfere with the structure of the binding cleft leading to inactivation of the enzyme. due to the fact that only one allele of dhfr has been deleted and the other is transcriptionally active, it should be possible to find revertants as background in a transfection experiment. indeed, revertants have been detected albeit at a frequency less than 10e- <dig> .

snps are the most frequent type of genetic polymorphism found when resequencing genomes from a common ancestor  <cit>  and single mutations in the coding regions can result in significant changes for the phenotype of the cell lines. for sequenced diploid genomes without known and validated snps, it has previously been seen to filter out snps with a depth less than half the mean depth of the genome  <cit> . but in the case of cho dxb <dig>  that practice would result in snps found in most haploid genes  to be remain undetected. for that reason a more lenient filter has to be applied in the current study for homozygous snps, which can be found in the haploid genes, and a more stringent filter requiring higher depth for heterozygous snps. the need to check for mutations in the relevant cell line before designing a laborious knock down, knockout or pcr primer solely based on the c. griseus genome sequence is highlighted by the  <dig> snps, which were found in the cho dxb <dig> genome within the coding regions of  <dig> genes. all genes containing snps as well as genes containing indels for cho-k <dig> atcc and cho dxb <dig> are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  snps located in the other sequenced cell lines are not included due to the fact that the current lower sequencing depth of these resulted in a ~20% probability of a correct snp call versus >99% in cho dxb <dig> and k <dig> atcc.

the copy number of a gene has previously been found to correlate well with the sequencing depth  <cit>  and this correlation was used to determine the copy number of the  <dig> genes both in the c. griseus genome and in the nine sequenced cho cell lines. based on analysis of the sequencing depth per gene it was found that only wild type c. griseus had a single peak centered on a copy number of two whereas the sequenced cho cell lines derived from this organism show distinct peaks revealing large number of genes only present in one copy or amplified to three or more copies. interestingly, the data indicates that 15-20% of the genes found in the nine cho cell lines sequenced to date are haploid. historically, the cho cells were often regarded functionally haploid at many genetic loci making these cell lines ideal for investigation of molecular functions in a eukaryotic cell model  <cit> . this current data explain this perceived haploid phenotype and this knowledge can also be advantageous for choosing a knock-out target in a specific pathway or for elucidating target region for a knock in. as chromosome one and four have the lowest level of cnvs across the nine cho cell lines, some of which have encountered heavy mutation pressure over a long period of time  <cit> , these chromosomes may be considered attractive landing platforms for knock-ins of heterologous genes.

based on the current sequencing data from cho dxb <dig> and available data from other cho cell lines a phylogenetic tree was created based on the copy variations between the cell lines. the tree reflects the clonal history of the cell lines  and correlates well with a phylogenetic tree recently published based on snps  <cit> . the cho-k <dig> cell lines lie in one cluster neighboring the cho dxb <dig> cluster and distant from the cho dg <dig> and cho-s/c <dig> branches. the clonal history of the f <dig> cell line by transfection of cho dxb <dig> is apparent from the phylogenetic tree as f <dig> emerges out of the same branch as cho dxb <dig> . nonetheless, a total of  <dig> genes are found to have undergone a cnv in the process from transfection of a pool of cho dxb <dig> cells, amplification of the insert and subsequent adaptation to suspension culture growth.

to give a more precise estimate of the genomic differences the sequencing depth across the coding regions of the genes  were measured. this allowed for normalization using hundreds of sequencing reads compared to looking at snps only supported by a dozen or so reads at most. furthermore, the coding dna sequences  are the most uniquely defined elements of the genome. for this reason, assessment of the cnvs are able to provide a more detailed look into the cell lines even when only very low sequencing depths are available. this is highlighted by the clustering of the cho-k <dig> cell lines closely together, even though cho-k <dig> atcc has been sequenced to a depth of 45x which is ~6x that of the other three cho-k <dig> cell lines and c <dig> is sequenced to a depth 3x that of cho-s.

each chromosome showed a distinct signature of cnvs giving for the first time an insight into cho chromosomal genome stability from next-generation sequencing data. in the future this method could be used in combination with fish to validate hypotheses on e.g. the range of genetic reductions and rearrangements on a particular chromosome  from cho-k <dig> atcc to cho dxb <dig>  the method also revealed a large number of haploid genes on chromosome 9/ <dig> which seem to have been reduced in the earliest cho cell lines prior to evolving into the cell lines sequenced today. some of these mutations might have been critical for establishing the independent immortal first cho cell lines.

each rearrangement event that has occurred in the evolution from cho-k <dig> to cho dxb <dig> may have had an impact on a multitude of genes as seen by all eight genes on the scaffold holding dhfr were found to be haploid  but probably caused by one single deletion event during uv radiation. therefore, the number of genes with altered cnvs is no true indication of the number of genomic rearrangements that has occurred as one large rearrangement events could impact dozens of genes. due to the short lengths of the genomic scaffolds in the current versions of the c. griseus and cho-k <dig> genomes, it is not yet feasible at this time to piece together the rearrangement history of the cho cell lines, but 3rd generation sequencing could permit the construction of a c. griseus genome with a reduced number of scaffolds  <cit> . once a more complete scaffold is available, cnv data could be used to make genomic based chromosomal maps which currently are only done using fish  <cit> .

with improved genome constructions possible in coming years, it will be informative to elucidate more detailed genomic differences between cho dg <dig> and cho dxb <dig> as they are the two dhfr negative cho cell lines most widely used today. as described earlier a comparison of found snps is not practical with the available data but it is seen from the copy numbers that  <dig> genes in cho dg <dig> are haploid versus  <dig> in cho dxb <dig>  in addition, there are  <dig> deleted genes in cho dxb <dig> versus  <dig> in cho dg <dig>  this difference can be ascribed to the harsh uv treatment that the cells were exposed to in the process of creating the cho dg <dig> cell line compared to the relatively mild uv treatment of the cho dxb <dig> cell line. the availability of additional sequence information from cho-s and cho dg <dig> among other would greatly improve the possibilities for comparing the genomic differences across a wider range of different cho cell lines in the coming decades. this comparison could be highly informative about the evolutional path and diversity that exists across cho cell hosts.

analysis for enrichment of go-terms revealed that a large portion of the changes in e.g. transcription factor copy number must have occurred in the early cho cell. it appears that cho dxb <dig> and f <dig> have further amplified ~ <dig> transcription factors and cho dg <dig> has reduced approximately the same number. further studies of the transcriptome and proteome should be able to reveal the effects of these genomic changes and link differences in genotype and phenotype.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work we have described the full genome sequencing of cho dxb <dig> including snps and cnvs which differ between this cell line and the other cho genomes that have been sequenced to date. the dhfr negative phenotype of the cell line was verified based on the lack of one allele and a missense mutation in the other transcriptionally active allele. the analysis of the cnvs revealed a large number of genes that were found to be haploid in the cho cell lines which is important for correct snp detection and detection strategy for knock out verification. it furthermore revealed unique patterns for the evolution of each of the chromosomes from the chinese hamster to each of the sequenced cho cell lines with chromosome one and four showing the lowest level of change.
