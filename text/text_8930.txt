BACKGROUND
the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition  is an important mechanism for cancer metastasis  <cit> , the cause of 90% of deaths from solid tumors  <cit> . during emt, epithelial cells lose epithelial characteristics and gain a mesenchymal morphological phenotype with the accompanying migration and invasion characteristics  <cit> . since invasion of tumor cells into the bloodstream is the first step of metastasis, emt enables the tumor cells to migrate and invade  <cit> .

emt is induced by expression of transcription factors , such as snail  <cit> , slug  <cit> , zeb <dig>  <cit> , zeb <dig>  <cit> , e <dig>  <cit> , twist <dig>  <cit> , foxc <dig>  <cit>  and goosecoid  <cit> . these tfs suppress critical epithelial cell traits, permitting the transformation to mesenchymal cells to occur. in cancer, overexpression of tfs promotes emt in tumor cells. although most tumors seem to undergo emt because of overexpression of  <dig> particular families of tfs   <cit> , additional emt-regulating tfs may remain to be identified.

because tfs are essential for the regulation of gene expression through their interactions with regulatory dna sequences, sites where they bind to dna can be detected by chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with sequencing . indeed, chip-seq technique can be used to infer gene regulatory mechanism in specific biological processes  <cit> . further, the increasing amount of tf and dna binding information in public databases can help inform the role of tfs in cancer and in emt in particular.

we systematically analyzed a large collection of chip-seq tf binding profiles in the a <dig> lung adenocarcinoma cell line. we evaluated the functional impact of tfs during emt by integrating chip-seq data with gene expression data in a <dig> cells treated with tgf-beta to induce emt. we then assessed the functional impact of these expression changes on specific biological processes. this approach identified the forkhead box protein a <dig>  as the most significant tf during emt in a <dig> lung cancer cells. functional analysis suggests that foxa <dig> is involved in the loss of cell adhesion and cell communication during the initiation of emt.

RESULTS
we analysed the genome-wide binding sites of multiple factors, including ctcf, elf <dig>  ets <dig>  fosl <dig>  gabpa, rest, ep <dig>  sin3ak <dig>  six <dig> sp <dig>  taf <dig>  tcf <dig>  usf <dig>  yy <dig>  zbtb <dig>  foxa <dig>  atf <dig>  bcl <dig>  and rna polymeraseii using encode chip-seq data from human a <dig> cells  <cit> . using mrna microarray data  from a <dig> cells treated with tgf-beta, we compared these binding site profiles with gene expression changes associated with emt  <cit> . to determine which tfs play an important role during emt in lung cancer, we calculated the potential sg of each gene to be regulated by each of the  <dig> tfs . for each tf we defined the gene sets m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig> as the  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> genes with the highest regulatory potentials. since the regulatory potential may be sensitive to the maximum distance between a tf binding site and the transcription start site  that would affect transcription, we considered different tf/dna binding cut-off distances from  <dig> to 10 kb to tss.

to identify genes that are differentially expressed during emt in lung cancer, we analyzed gene expression data on human a <dig> cells after treatment with tgf-beta for  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 72 h. array quality control and data normalization were performed with a linear model for microarray data, limma  <cit> . genes with low variability across samples were removed from the analysis. the gene expression pattern displayed obvious differences after 16 h of tgf-beta induction. we therefore selected  <dig> microarrays and grouped them into two groups: a control group that included six samples at 0 h and  <dig>  h, and a treatment group that included nine samples at 16 h, 24 h, and 72 h. the differentially expressed genes during emt were determined with p values corrected with the benjamini-hochberg method  <cit>  for controlling false discovery rate. we identified  <dig>  upregulated genes and  <dig>  downregulated genes .

the impact of transcription factors during emt in lung cancer
we compared the genes that had high tf regulatory potential scores with genes that were differentially expressed in emt. specifically, we calculated impact scores, remt_up and remt_down, for each tf, to summarize the fraction of genes with a high regulatory potential that were, respectively, up- or down-expressed during emt . remt_down for foxa <dig> was significantly greater than that for other tfs in biologically replicated chip-seq data for gene sets m <dig>  scores were statistically higher  for foxa <dig>  even when the regulatory distance was varied from  <dig> to 10 kb . we saw similar results for gene sets m <dig> , m <dig> , and m <dig> , suggesting that foxa <dig> is the most prominent considered tf involved in emt. foxa <dig> downregulates target genes involved in emt at loci closer to the tss than other tfs, since remt_down was consistently high regardless of the regulatory distance. conversely, remt_up and remt_down of other tfs  gradually increased as the regulatory distance to the tss increased . the closer proximity of foxa <dig> to the tss further strengthens the likelihood of true transcriptional regulation, rather than non-regulatory tf/dna association.

identification and functional analysis of tf-regulated targets
to determine whether foxa <dig> also contributes to lung adenocarcinoma tumorigenesis by directly regulating its transcriptional targets, we collected  <dig>  upregulated and  <dig>  downregulated genes in lung adenocarcinoma from oncomine  <cit>  gene expression signatures with concept names of ‘lung adenocarcinoma vs. normal - top 10% over-expressed ’ and ‘lung adenocarcinoma vs. normal - top 10% under-expressed ’. impact scores were calculated for each tf in lung cancer tumorigenesis as rca_up and rca_down. for foxa <dig>  remt_down scores for different regulatory distances were significantly high, p <  <dig> ) but rca_up, rca_down and remt_up scores were not significantly high . our analysis indicates that foxa <dig> is involved in emt, but may not significantly contribute to lung adenocarcinoma tumorigenesis through direct regulation of target genes. we therefore focused on the regulatory mechanism of foxa <dig> during emt.

as foxa <dig> was implicated during emt in lung cancer, we examined which functions foxa <dig> was likely to regulate. both vertebrate liver and lung derive from the early embryonic endoderm layer and thus have similar emt programs. therefore, we used the consensus binding sites generated from foxa <dig> chip-seq data in a <dig> cells and hepatic hepg <dig> cells to narrow down a set of emt-related and potentially foxa1-regulated genes. macs  <cit>  estimates the false discovery rate of each binding site by q value  <cit> . using a strict threshold of q < 10- <dig>  we identified  <dig>  overlapping binding sites. looking for motifs in the top  <dig>  overlapping binding sites using seqpos  <cit> , we found that all top  <dig> motifs  belong to the forkhead family, with foxa <dig> motif being the most enriched . the motif analysis suggests that foxa <dig> might regulate emt-related genes directly. we then applied the regulatory potential  to sort foxa1-regulated genes and selected top  <dig> genes  with a regulatory potential greater than  <dig>  as the most likely candidates of foxa1-regulated genes.

we employed great  <cit>  to find functional categories enriched by foxa1-regulated genes . we then used the hypergeometric distribution to select the functions also enriched by upregulated or downregulated genes during emt . foxa1-regulated genes were involved in a variety of biological processes and pathways. downregulated, but not upregulated, genes were enriched in  <dig> go biological processes,  <dig> go cellular component, and  <dig> pathway commons , suggesting that foxa <dig> may be repressing emt. the emt-related functions enriched by downregulated genes included cell communication, nectin adhesion pathways, focal adhesion kinase signaling, fibrinogen complex signaling, and foxa <dig> tf networks . the information of all enriched functions, enrichment scores, and the enriched genes was also shown .

functions with p <  <dig>  are included.

four downregulated genes that enriched cell communication, nectin adhesion, and focal adhesion kinase and fibrinogen complex signaling are related to the loss of epithelial traits in metastasis initiation. fga, fgb and fgl <dig> were involved in multiple emt-related functions , and fgg was also identified with a less stringent q value threshold. fga/fgb/fgg encode the alpha/beta/gamma components of fibrinogen, a blood-borne glycoprotein comprised of three pairs of non-identical polypeptide chains. fibrinogen is cleaved by thrombin following vascular injury to form fibrin, the most abundant component of blood clots  <cit> . in addition, fibrinogen induces endothelial cell adhesion and spreading via the release of endogenous matrix proteins and the recruitment of more than one integrin receptor  <cit> . fgl <dig> also encodes a member of the fibrinogen family. fga, fgb, fgg and fgl <dig> were downregulated during emt of lung cancer  and were mapped to the go term ‘fibrinogen complex’. chip-seq data from a <dig> cells showed that foxa <dig> was strongly bound to tss of these genes . no binding sites were found at the tss of these genes in the human breast adenocarcinoma cell line mcf <dig> or in the human prostate adenocarcinoma cell line lncap , suggesting that the regulatory role of foxa <dig> in breast and prostate cancer might differ from that of lung and liver cancer. thus, fga, fgb, fgg and fgl <dig> could be important direct target genes of foxa <dig> that are involved in emt of lung and liver cancer specifically.

foxa <dig> was involved in the functions including foxa <dig> transcription factor network and cell communication, and foxa <dig> was downregulated during emt of lung cancer . chip-seq data showed that foxa <dig> was bound to tss of foxa <dig> .

experimental validation of predicted foxa1-regulated targets
rna interference and reverse transcription quantitative pcr  were used to check whether foxa <dig> regulates its predicted target genes in a <dig> cells. we investigated foxa1’s effect on fga, fgb, fgg and fgl <dig> genes by knocking down foxa <dig> followed by rt-qpcr. expression of fgb and fgg showed the significant decrease after foxa <dig> was knocked down with two independent sirnas targeting foxa <dig>  while expression of fga and fgl <dig> was significantly decreased after transfection with one of the sirnas .

discussion
emt is a physiological process originally described in embryonic development  <cit> . foxa family proteins are critical for epithelial differentiation in many endoderm-derived organs, including pancreas  <cit> , lung  <cit>  and liver  <cit> . crawford et al. identified the role of foxa <dig> during emt in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma  <cit> ; they found that foxa <dig> and foxa <dig> are important antagonists of emt through positive regulation of e-cadherin and maintenance of the epithelial phenotype. song et al. also reported that foxa <dig> suppresses tumor metastasis by inhibiting emt in human lung cancer  <cit> .

here, we identified foxa <dig> as an important tf involved in emt during lung cancer progression. genes regulated by foxa <dig> are down-expressed and enriched in the functions including cell communication, nectin adhesion pathways, focal adhesion kinase signalling and fibrinogen complex signalling, so foxa <dig> may be directly involved in metastasis initiation, namely the loss of cellular adhesion and cellular communication. several emt effectors, including fga, fgb, fgg, and fgl <dig>  were indicated as potential regulatory targets of foxa <dig>  expression of fgb and fgg showed significant decrease after foxa <dig> was knocked down. therefore, our analysis combining expression and tf regulatory data suggests that foxa <dig> could be the potential negative regulator of emt and could play pivotal roles in the initial steps of lung cancer metastasis. in pancreas cancer foxa1/ <dig> factors are suppressed by emt-inducing signals, such as tgfb and dna methylation. methylation-mediated suppression of foxa <dig> leads to downregulation of emt-related gene e-cadherin and induces emt  <cit> . stoffel et al.  <cit>  reported that in embryonic stem cells expression of foxa <dig> is reduced in the absence of foxa <dig>  and foxa <dig> mrna is undetectable in foxa <dig> null embryoid bodies, implying that foxa <dig> is essential for foxa <dig> expression. therefore, in lung cancer foxa <dig> activity may be regulated by other regulators such as foxa <dig> whose activities could be directly modulated through epigenetic mechanisms. interestingly, our study also found a strong binding site of foxa <dig> at the promoter of foxa <dig> , suggesting the potential regulation of foxa <dig> on foxa <dig> in a <dig> cells. more detailed functional and mechanistic studies are required to fully unveil the significance of foxa <dig> during emt and lung cancer progression.

our study further demonstrates how published chip-seq and gene expression data could be integrated to understand the impact of tfs in a specific biological process. chip-seq data of a <dig> cells were generated without tgf-beta stimulation, so our approach might only fish out negative regulators and might miss factors which positively regulate emt. despite this limitation, our approach is expected to identify potential positive factors if chip-seq data from tgfb-stimulated cells are available.

CONCLUSIONS
a systematic computational analysis based on multiple chip-seq and gene expression datasets suggests that foxa <dig> is a potentially important negative regulator in the emt of lung adenocarcinoma. foxa <dig> may regulate a series of critical emt effector genes relevant to cellular adhesion and cellular communication to maintain epithelial traits downregulated in emt. this approach can also be transplanted into other biological systems to infer regulators of transcriptional mechanisms, especially as more chip-seq and expression data accumulate.
