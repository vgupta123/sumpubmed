BACKGROUND
endogenous and exogenous dna damage are life-long threats to the health of an organism and can limit the survival and regenerative potential of both embryonic stem cells  and adult stem cells . any genetic alterations in the progenitor cells can compromise the genomic stability and functionality of entire cell lineages  <cit> . moreover, damage to cellular dna can be the most important initiating factor in the development of cancer. the dna damage response  network has developed to sense and respond to dna damage and is critical for the maintenance of genetic integrity. the ddr is a complex network that involves the control of cell cycle arrest, the activation of dna repair machinery, the induction of apoptosis, and the regulation of telomere length. within this network, the activation of dna damage checkpoints plays a central role in ddr signaling to ensure the correct scan of the entire genome before dna replication  and cell division   <cit> .

although the dna damage-mediated checkpoint is critical in ddr signaling, many of the regulatory components that govern this signaling pathway, specifically in cells at the embryonic stage and during developmental processes, are not known. the cell cycle and the dna damage checkpoint change over time, from an extremely short g <dig> cell cycle to maintain pluripotency, to lengthening the g <dig> phase during differentiation  <cit> ; from lacking a g <dig> checkpoint  <cit>  to the establishment of a g <dig> cell cycle arrest. for example, both murine and human es cells, as well as human embryonic carcinoma  cells, are defective in the g <dig> checkpoint after dna damage  <cit> . differentiated ec cells show an increased g <dig> cell population but lack a g <dig> checkpoint, even though ddr protein activation appears to be normal  <cit> . thus, the developmental stages and circumstances under which the g <dig> cell cycle checkpoint is required remain unclear. moreover, most studies regarding ddr checkpoints and dna repair in human and murine stem cells have been performed in vitro with esc lines and compared to mouse embryonic fibroblasts  or genetic knockout mefs, an approach which reflects only a short period of embryonic development.

for stem or progenitor cells, it is necessary to evolve effective and non-mutagenic dna repair capacities to avoid passing mutations on to subsequent generations and initiating cancers  <cit> . in both humans and mice, es cells have been shown to be more capable of repairing dna damage than their differentiated derivatives  <cit> . recent studies suggest that the kinetics of dna repair are different in the hematopoietic stem cells  and progenitor cells of human versus mouse; whereas murine hscs display faster repair kinetics, human hscs are less capable of dna repair and are more pro-apoptotic  <cit> . therefore, different cell lineages, as well as different species of stem and progenitor cells, have different ddr and repair capacities. dna double-strand breaks , which arise during dna replication or following exposure to ionizing radiation , are considered the most harmful lesions. the principal mechanisms of dsb repair in mammalian cells include nonhomologous end-joining  and homologous recombination repair . hr ensures accurate dsb repair, while nhej repair is rapid and efficient but error-prone  <cit> .

in the past, mef cells, derived from various genetic knockout mice, have been used for cell cycle related studies in vitro whereas cell cycle studies in vivo at embryonic stages have been performed by in situ assays. there have been no detailed investigations of ddr kinetics, including checkpoints and dna damage repair, at different embryonic developmental stages during organ development by using live cells. in this study, we investigated when  and how the dna damage-mediated g <dig> checkpoint is established during in vivo embryonic liver development and associated dna damage repair pathways.

methods
mouse strains and embryos
icr mice  were provided and maintained by the laboratory animal unit of the university of hong kong and used for all experiments. embryos at different stages, including e <dig> , e <dig> , e <dig> , and e <dig> , were obtained from pregnant icr mice. post-natal mice at p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  and p <dig> were also used. h&e stained mouse liver tissue structures from embryonic stage to adult were shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  this study was approved by the committee on the use of live animals of the university of hong kong .

ionizing radiation 
pregnant mice were subjected to 4–6 gy of ir  at defined embryonic stages. at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 24 hours after ir, pregnant mice were sacrificed, and embryonic livers were dissected for cell cycle analysis and other experiments. p <dig> to p <dig> mice were also subjected to 2 gy of ir, and the liver cells were isolated at multiple time points.

isolation of fetal or adult liver cells
fetal livers were dissected out from mouse embryos , minced, and digested with collagenase-v  for 10 minutes at 37°c. the tissue was then filtered through a 40 μm nylon mesh to remove debris. the cells were collected by centrifugation  at 4°c. isolated single liver cells were fixed with cold 80% ethanol and kept at -20°c for cell cycle analysis. the same procedure was used to isolate adult liver cells. for cell cycle analysis, a pool of 3– <dig> of e <dig>  embryonic livers and 2– <dig> of e <dig>  or e <dig>  fetal livers was collected.

tissue specimens and nuclear protein fractions
the liver tissue was frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after harvest for the generation of protein lysates. for nuclear protein extraction, 20 g of fresh fetal liver was homogenized thoroughly on ice and centrifuged. the pellet was re-suspended in buffer b  glycerol, ph  <dig> ) and 300 mm nacl for 20 minutes at 4°c. after centrifugation , the supernatant containing the nuclear protein was kept at -70°c prior to performing the dna repair assays. for immunohistochemistry, liver tissue was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight and then embedded in paraffin blocks. for e <dig>  to e <dig> , the whole embryos were fixed; for e <dig>  to p <dig>  the dissected livers were fixed.

flow cytometry
for analysis of the cell cycle, the nuclei were stained with propidium iodide  and analyzed with a cytomics fc  <dig> . fetal liver cells were also stained with an anti-albumin antibody  at different embryonic stages to establish a threshold by which albumin-positive populations were gated for the analysis of dna content. starting at e <dig> , over 80% of the isolated embryonic liver cells expressed albumin . the percentage of each cell cycle population was calculated with modfit v <dig>  software .

antibodies, western blots , and immunoprecipitation 
antibodies against cyclins a, e, and b <dig> and those against cdk <dig>  p <dig>  rad <dig>  and ligase iv were obtained from santa cruz biotechnology . antibodies against cyclin d <dig>  phospho-cdk <dig> , and γ-h2ax were purchased from cell signaling technology . an anti-cdk <dig> antibody was kindly provided by prof. k yamashita . for wb, 10–40 μg of total tissue protein lysate was loaded and separated on 10% or 12% acrylamide gels and transferred to pvdf membranes, which were then incubated with primary and secondary antibodies. protein expression was revealed with enhanced chemi lumescent  reagents . for ip, total cell lysates  were incubated with 1–2 μl of primary antibody followed by incubation with 30 μl of protein g sepharose . after  <dig> to  <dig> washes, the immune complexes were dissolved in sds sample buffer for wb. for most ip assays, rabbit-derived antibodies were used to avoid cross-reaction.

immunohistochemistry
for antigen unmasking, deparaffinized sections were boiled for 10 minutes. after blocking with 3% h2o <dig> for 10 minutes and 1% bsa for 1 hour, the sections were incubated with an anti-γh2ax antibody overnight at 4°c. polymer horseradishperoxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and dab + chromogen  were used to visualize the signal.

in vitro nhej assay
a puc <dig> plasmid was cut with the restriction enzyme pvuii overnight at 37°c and followed by alkaline phosphatase  treatment for 1 hour to prevent self-ligation of the fragment. the linearized plasmid was identified by agarose gel electrophoresis and purified by a gel purification kit . 50 ng of the linearized dna was used as a substrate and incubated with fetal liver nuclear protein  in t <dig> ligase buffer and 1 mm dntps for 2 hours at 14°c. after this reaction, the dna was de-proteinized by purification using a pcr purification kit . the amount of end-joined dna products was measured by quantitative real-time pcr with primer set a for a loading control, resulting in the amplification of a 151 bp dna product at a 143 bp distance from a pvuii site. primer set b flanked the joining junction for the amplification of the joined dna fragments. the relative nhej activity was calculated as the ratio of the end-joined products normalized to the loading control products. primer sets a and b are shown in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

in situ cell death detection
apoptotic liver cells on embryonic liver sections were determined by using in situ cell death detection fluorescein kit  following manufacturer’s instruction.

g-banding and spectral karyotyping  analysis
pregnant mice were exposed to  <dig>  gy ir at embryonic stages  <dig>  and  <dig> . the embryos surviving this low dose of ir developed normally. the offspring were allowed to grow to adulthood , and the liver cells were then isolated from the mice and cultured. chromosome g-banding and sky analysis was performed by the van andel institute  to examine chromosome breakage and rearrangement.

RESULTS
cell cycle shifting at different developmental stages
we dissected and isolated single liver cells from embryonic, postnatal, and adult mice and determined the cell phase by measuring the pi-stained dna content. from e <dig>  to e <dig> , over 50% of the liver cells were in the s phase, indicating that liver cells proliferate rapidly at these stages. at e <dig> , the cell phase distribution started to shift from the s to g <dig> cell cycle phase, as demonstrated by a decrease in the s phase and an increase in the g <dig> phase . interestingly, at p <dig>  more than 80% of the liver cells were in the g <dig> phase and, in adults, there was a further reduction in the percentage of cells in the s and g2/m phases . thus, liver cells seem to enter into a slow proliferation at stage of  <dig> to 3 weeks earlier than adult age. these data suggested that a reduction in the s phase and an expansion of the g <dig> phase constituted the main cell cycle shifts during the development of the mouse liver.

cell cycle drivers at different developmental stages
next, we examined the expression of cell cycle drivers  in liver cells at different developmental stages. for the g <dig> and s phases, cyclin e and cdk <dig>  but not cyclin a, showed consistently high levels of expression at all developmental stages . cyclin d <dig> was expressed at low levels during most stages and was enhanced at p <dig> to p <dig>  although the g <dig> cell phase was dominant at these developmental time points . for the g2/m phase, cyclin b <dig> was consistently expressed at high levels during all stages and was further enhanced after the embryonic stage, whereas cdk <dig> was down-regulated in the adult liver . when the cdk inhibitors were measured, p <dig> expression seemed to be in accordance with the increased g <dig> population, while p <dig> was not detectable . taken together, we observed that only cdk <dig> and cyclin a were down-regulated during embryonic liver development.

establishment of the g <dig> checkpoint in e <dig> /e <dig>  embryonic liver cells
it has been well demonstrated that es cells are defective in the dna damage-mediated g <dig> checkpoint  <cit> . at which developmental stage, and under which circumstances, the g <dig> cell cycle checkpoint is necessary for the cell is still unclear. by subjecting pregnant mice to ir, we were able to investigate the ir-mediated dna damage checkpoint in liver cells from embryonic stages e <dig> , e <dig> , e <dig> , and e <dig>  to adulthood. in response to ir, liver cells showed a notable but transient g <dig> cell cycle arrest at e <dig> , e <dig> , e <dig> , and e <dig> , along with a significant reduction of g <dig> and s-phase cells . at e <dig> , the liver cells returned to a proliferating pattern, with the s phase population increasing at later time points following ir . starting at embryonic stage e <dig> /e <dig> , a significant g <dig> cell cycle arrest was observed, following a transient g <dig> arrest . at e <dig> , the extent of transient g <dig> arrest was reduced, whereas the ir-mediated g <dig> cell accumulation was more prominent . from p <dig> to p <dig>  the ir-mediated cell cycle arrest in all three phases was insignificant compared to that of the embryonic stage  and showed a similar pattern as non-ir cells . thus, during early development, g <dig> arrest was the predominant ddr-mediated cell cycle arrest, and the g <dig> checkpoint appeared at the developmental stage of e <dig> /e <dig> .

cdk <dig> and p <dig> became regulated in response to ir in e <dig> /e <dig>  embryonic liver cells
we next investigated cell cycle checkpoint effectors that contribute to the formation of the g <dig> as well as g2/m checkpoint. these effectors, including cyclins d <dig>  a, e, and b <dig>  as well as cdk <dig>  and cdk <dig>  were evaluated at different time points before and after ir. in response to ir, cdk <dig> was down regulated in e <dig> /e <dig> , but not in e <dig>  embryonic liver cells . no significant ir-mediated g <dig> checkpoint was observed at e <dig>  , suggesting that the down regulation of cdk <dig> might be associated with the establishment of g <dig> cell cycle arrest. more importantly, the g <dig> checkpoint regulator p <dig> was enhanced to a greater level at e <dig>  than at e <dig>  . no periodicity in accordance with cell cycle progression was observed with the other cyclins or with cdk <dig> .

regulation of the ir-mediated g <dig> checkpoint through the down-regulation of the cdk2/cyclin e complex in e <dig>  embryonic liver cells
the interaction of cdks and cyclins in response to ir in liver cells was compared at e <dig>  and e <dig>  by co-ip. the expression of the cdk2/cyclin e complex was significantly reduced after ir in e <dig> , but not e <dig> , liver cells . this was confirmed by two different co-ip approaches . further, cdk <dig> phosphorylation at thr  <dig>  which was necessary for the activation of cdk <dig> complexes, was reduced after ir at e <dig>  . the interactions between cdk <dig> and the cyclins a and b <dig> and between cdk <dig> and the cyclins a and b <dig> remained the same before and after ir in both e <dig>  and e <dig>  liver cells . these results suggested that reduced cdk <dig> activity by the down regulation of phosphorylation of cdk <dig>  and the cdk2/cyclin e complex was required for dna damage-mediated g <dig> cell cycle arrest in e <dig>  cells, and that this down regulation may be regulated by p <dig> .

enhanced dna damage repair capacity in e <dig>  compared to e <dig>  embryonic liver cells
murine es cells have a higher dna repair capacity than their differentiated derivatives such as fibroblasts  <cit> . we also compared the nhej pathway in e <dig>  and e <dig>  liver cells by an in vitro functional recombination assay using nuclear protein extracts. ir induced a 3-fold increase in nhej activity in e <dig>  liver cells compared to baseline activity  , whereas this phenomenon was not observed in e <dig>  liver cells  . the expression of the dna repair proteins rad <dig>  and ligase iv  seemed to be higher at e <dig>  than e <dig>  . this finding suggested that there appeared to be more nhej repair at the developmental stage of e <dig>  compared to earlier stages. hr activity could not be measured in this study, although studies have shown that nhej is a rapid and efficient repair mechanism  <cit> .

short-term biological effects
in principle, the dna damage-induced g <dig> cell cycle checkpoint would allow time for the repair of damaged dna. given that the g <dig> checkpoint was observed in e <dig>  liver cells  in combination with a significantly enhanced dna damage repair activity , we consequently asked whether this checkpoint might be biologically protective against dna damage in the short and long term. we collected e <dig>  and e <dig>  embryonic liver tissue at  <dig>   <dig>  and 24 hours after ir to evaluate the dna damage foci. the number of γh2ax dsb foci containing nuclei initially increased to a similar extent  in both e <dig>  and e <dig>  liver cells . the γh2ax dsb foci positive cells remained significantly high at 24 hours after ir in e <dig>  liver cells, but not in e <dig>  liver cells. thus, the amount of time required for the γh2ax foci to return to basal, non-ir levels  was 24 hours in the e <dig>  liver tissue. however, the percentage of dsb foci containing cells remained high  in e <dig>  liver tissue at this time point . previous studies have identified a linear association between γh2ax foci formation and dna damage  <cit> . therefore, the high percentage of γh2ax foci remaining in e <dig>  liver tissue after 24 hours suggested sustained dna damage at this developmental stage. we further determined cellular apoptosis and found a significantly higher percentage of early apoptotic cells in e <dig>  liver tissue than in e <dig>  liver tissue . thus, e <dig>  liver cells which lacking of g <dig> checkpoint also had a sustained dna damage and increased cell death.

p 
long-term biological effects
for the evaluation of long-term effects, chromosome g-banding and sky analysis were performed in murine adult liver cells derived from the embryos that were exposed to  <dig>  gy ir at e <dig>  or e <dig> . the chromosomes from  <dig> adult liver cells were examined in each case. the total number of chromosomes with breaks or rearrangements was significantly higher in adult liver cells derived from the embryos that were exposed to ir at e <dig>  than at e <dig>   . amongst abnormal chromosomes, the percentages of chromosome breakage were over 80% in both groups of cells. however, the rates of deletion, which is one of the most severe forms of chromosome breakage, was significantly higher in the adult liver cells derived from the embryos that were exposed to ir at e <dig>   than at e <dig>  . figure 5a and b showed representative aberrant chromosome pattern at metaphase by g-banding and sky analysis from liver cells derived from ir at e <dig>  and e <dig>  respectively, with overall chromosome abnormality looked more severe in liver cells ir at e <dig>   than ir at e <dig>   compared to a normal chromosome pattern . chromosome endoreduplication phenomenon was also observed in the adult liver cells derived from the embryos that were exposed to ir at e <dig>  but not at e <dig>  , which might result from abnormal mitosis leading to cellular polyploidy. moreover, postnatal deaths occurred in response to 2 gy ir at e <dig>  but not at e <dig>  . thus, g <dig> checkpoint initiation and enhanced dna repair might be able to reduce mortality and severe chromosome damage in the long term.

legend: total of  <dig> adult liver cells were examined in ir at e <dig>  and e <dig>  respectively, with full chromosome karyotyping of each cells.  <dig> out of  <dig> liver cells contained abnormal chromosomes in both e <dig>  and e <dig> . comparisons of overall number of chromosomes with breakage or rearrangements and severe abnormal chromosome sub-categories between e <dig>  and e <dig>  were summarized in table  <dig> 

discussion
in this study, we characterized the establishment of the g <dig> checkpoint and the associated dsb repair, as well as the biological effects of these processes, in the murine embryonic liver at different stages of development. it is the first investigation using live embryonic liver tissue to investigate the dna damage-mediated checkpoint and repair during embryonic development.

es cells lack dna damage-mediated g <dig> checkpoints in culture  <cit>  and employ s and g <dig> cell cycle arrest as protective mechanisms  <cit> . when es cells differentiated and entered into lineage and organ development, g <dig> cell cycle arrest was still the earliest response to dna damage   <cit>  during the early developmental stages of embryonic liver cells . beginning at e <dig> /e <dig> , the embryonic liver cells started to establish a g <dig> dna damage checkpoint, where g <dig> cell cycle arrest replaced transient g <dig> arrest for longer periods of time following dna damage   <cit> . it is unclear why the g <dig> checkpoint is established so much later than the g <dig> checkpoint. a requirement for rapid proliferation results in the cells being mostly in the s and g2/m cell cycles, with a short g <dig> phase, during the early developmental stage, which might also equip cells with s and g2/m cell cycle checkpoint mechanisms in response to dna damage. during the differentiation of es cells and embryo development, the g <dig> cell cycle length and g <dig> population both increase  <cit> , as does the g <dig> checkpoint machinery   <cit> . more importantly, cell cycle arrest provides time for the repair of dna damage. the g <dig> arrest could prevent apoptosis, while the g <dig> arrest is important to prevent damaged dna from entering into the s phase. thus, by comparison between e <dig>  and e <dig> , our study demonstrates that the development of the g <dig> checkpoint play a critical role in long-term genome stability  , although aberrant chromosomes still exist in the adult liver cells, and protection is, therefore, not complete .

clearly, the initiation of the g <dig> checkpoint in e <dig> /e <dig>  embryonic liver cells was regulated by the declining activity of the cdk2/cyclin e complex . the down-regulation of cdk <dig> did not appear to be regulated by p <dig>  as the p <dig> expression levels were associated with an increased g <dig> population during embryonic liver development, regardless of the ddr . however, p <dig> expression was not related to the g <dig> population expansion during embryonic liver maturation  but was instead induced by dna damage , and induced p <dig> expression was more robust at e <dig> /e <dig>  than at earlier stages . the association between differentiation and the length of the g <dig> phase has always been a topic of interest. recently, a comprehensive study demonstrated that in the process of murine esc differentiation, p <dig> accumulation  results in the inactivation of cdk <dig> and cyclin e, leading to a delay in the g1-to-s phase transition; these results suggest interdependence between g <dig> length and differentiation  <cit> . albeit not restricted to es cells, g <dig> length can directly impact the differentiation of neural and hematopoietic stem cells during development and adulthood  <cit> , of which, down-regulation of cdk2/cyclin e seems to be one of the main mechanical drives in g <dig> lengthening  <cit> ; both inhibition of cdk2/cyclin e activity  <cit>  or depletion of cdk2/cdk <dig>  <cit>  resulted in increasing g <dig> length and consequently neuronal differentiation. in embryonic liver, our study expends the role of down-regulation of cdk2/cyclin e in dna damage mediated g <dig> cell cycle arrest . thus, the proposed regulatory mechanism for g <dig> phase expansion in mesc or in neuronal sc differentiation also applied to the initiation of the g <dig> dna damage checkpoint during embryonic liver cell development. the g <dig> checkpoint only appeared at the stage  where ir induced high expression of p <dig>  which led to the inhibition of the cdk2/cyclin e complex and the block in the g1-to-s transition . thus, p21-cdk2/cyclin e-mediated g <dig> expansion  <cit>  seems to be a common regulatory mechanism for both the length of the g <dig> cell phase and the dna damage-mediated g <dig> cell cycle arrest .

γh2ax positive cells in e <dig>  livers remained high throughout longer time course after ir , the relative larger population of e <dig>  liver cells in s phase could be a cause; as it has shown that dsb foci developed during the course of the uv-induced replication arrest  <cit> . however, a minority of the uv induced foci showed dsb γh2ax colocalizing with 53bp <dig>  whereas the majority was pan-nuclear γh2ax, a pre-apoptotic signal in the s phase  <cit> . in our experimental setting:  ir did not induce replication arrest ;  after a short g <dig> arrest, e <dig>  liver cells returned to a basal level but not an s phase arrest ;  the fraction of γh2ax positive cells was not significantly different between e <dig>  and e <dig>  liver cells under the condition without ir  , whereas s phase population of both were high  . moreover, rapid nhej repair is not limited to specific cell phase but occurs throughout all cell cycle phases  <cit> . thus, high levels of γh2ax foci in e <dig>  liver cells were likely due to their dna repair capability not being competent enough, as well as lacking g <dig> arrest checkpoint control . in accordance, early apoptosis was significantly higher in e <dig>  compared to e <dig>  liver cells  , which is a cellular consequence of absence of g <dig> checkpoint as well as retaining high level of un-repaired dna damage in e <dig> .

CONCLUSIONS
the initiation of the dna damage-mediated g <dig> cell cycle arrest occurs at embryonic stage e <dig> /e <dig>  in embryonic liver cells, and this process is regulated by the p21-mediated down-regulation of the cdk2/cyclin e complex. the g <dig> checkpoint, in combination with dna repair, plays a biological role in repairing cellular dsbs and in preventing early apoptosis in the short term and reducing chromosome abnormalities in the long term.
