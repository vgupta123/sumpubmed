BACKGROUND
drought, cold and high salinity are the major adverse environmental factors that can adversely affect plant growth and crop production. a variety of genes are induced under these stress conditions, enabling plants to adapt to these abiotic stresses  <cit> . it is well known that complex transcriptional regulatory networks are involved in stress-induced changes in gene expression  <cit> . among the best characterized stress-responsive transcription factors are the dehydration responsive element  binding proteins drebs  <cit> . the dreb protein family can be divided into six small groups  based on similarity in the apetala <dig>  dna-binding domain  <cit> . most reports have focused on dreb-type transcriptional activators. three dreb <dig> proteins, dreb1a, dreb1b, and dreb1c, members of the a- <dig> dreb group, transactivate cold-induced expression of rd/cor/lti  genes through interactions between their ap <dig> dna binding domains and the core dre cis-elements  present in the promoters of the target genes  <cit> . overexpression of each dreb <dig> constitutively induces the dreb <dig> regulon and enhances plant freezing tolerance  <cit> . similar results have been reported for the constitutive active form of the dreb <dig> proteins, the a- <dig> group members, under dehydration and high salinity stress conditions  <cit> . tiny, a member of the a- <dig> dreb group, can activate the expression of both dre- and ere-  regulated genes. in this way, tiny plays a role in the crosstalk between abiotic and biotic stress-responsive gene expression pathways by connecting the dre- and ere-mediated signaling pathways  <cit> . rap <dig> , a member of the a- <dig> group, functions as a transactivator of dre- and ere-mediated genes that are responsive to light, ethylene and drought, suggesting that rap <dig>  acts in the cross-talk between the light and ethylene signaling pathways to coordinately regulate multiple development processes and stress responses  <cit> .

although the mechanisms of activation mediated by dreb proteins involved in plant stress responses are relatively well studied, little is known about the negative regulation of stress genes mediated by the dreb-type transcriptional repressors. transcriptional repression is an essential mechanism in the precise control of gene expression  <cit> . transcriptional repressors may maintain the stress response genes in an off state in the absence of any stress. in addition, they may keep the expression of stress response genes under tight control, to prevent the metabolic waste and self-inflicted damage that can be caused by a runaway stress response  <cit> .

in plants, transcriptional repressors containing the erf-associated amphiphilic repression  motif have been reported to play important roles in modulating plant stress and defense responses  <cit> . the ear-motif  was first identified in the c-terminal region of class ii erfs  and c2h2-  type zinc-finger proteins  <cit> . recently, many studies have revealed the in planta roles of ear-motif-containing repressors in modulating plant responses to drought  <cit> , cold  <cit> , uv  <cit> , pathogen infection  <cit> , and hormone signaling  <cit> . the ear-repressor aterf <dig> binds to the gcc box of pdf <dig> , a gene encoding an antimicrobial peptide, and represses its jasmonate-ethylene-dependent expression. overexpression of aterf <dig> in arabidopsis renders the plants more susceptible to the wilt pathogen fusarium oxysporum  <cit> . similar to aterf <dig>  aterf <dig> binds to the gcc box of aba-induced genes and represses their transcription. arabidopsis plants overexpressing aterf <dig> show a reduced sensitivity of guard cells to aba and an increase in transpired water loss  <cit> . another example of ear-repressors are the key members of the c2h <dig> zinc-finger family of proteins, such as zat <dig>  <cit> , zat <dig>  <cit>  and zat <dig>  <cit> . these proteins suppress the repressors of defense responses, thus increasing arabidopsis tolerance to abiotic stress.

the first dreb-type transcriptional repressor identified was found in gossypium hirsutum, as ghdbp <dig>  a member of the a- <dig> dreb group  <cit> . ghdbp <dig> can specially bind to the dre and repress the expression of a reporter gene driven by dre in tobacco leaves. the transcriptional repression domain utilized by ghdbp <dig> is located in the ear-motif-like domain in the c-terminal region of the protein  <cit> . this domain is also found in other dreb proteins, including rap <dig>  from arabidopsis, gmdreb <dig> from soybean, and osrap <dig>  from rice  <cit> . these findings suggest that there may be a molecular adaptation mechanism in plant stress responses, harmoniously mediated by dreb proteins that function as either activators or repressors. this expectation provokes our interest in exploring the corresponding molecular behaviors of dreb-type transcription repressors in plants.

this study establishes that rap <dig>  is a dreb-type, ear-motif-containing transcriptional repressor that negatively regulates plant responses to cold and drought stresses. this repression by rap <dig>  maintains tight control over these responses. in arabidopsis, rap <dig>  is transcriptionally activated by drought and cold stresses and binds to the dre/crts in the promoters of rd/cor genes, repressing the stress-induced expression of such genes. arabidopsis plants overexpressing rap <dig>  show enhanced sensitivity to cold and drought stresses, whereas rap <dig>  t-dna insertion alleles result in reduced stress sensitivity. also, we present evidence that rap <dig>  can bind to the dres present in its own promoter and repress its own expression, indicating a negative feedback control in the regulation of rap <dig> 's expression. together, our findings indicate how rap <dig> , by cooperating with other dreb-type transcriptional activators, modulates plant responses to cold and drought stresses.

RESULTS
sequence characterization of the rap <dig>  gene
the dna sequence of rap <dig>  gene was first identified by okamuro et al.  <cit> . the  <dig> bp of the full-length cdna contains an open reading frame encoding a protein of  <dig> amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of  <dig>  kda and a calculated pi of  <dig> . examination of the rap <dig>  protein sequence, using programs prosite  <cit>  and predictnls  <cit> , identified a basic amino acid stretch  in its n-terminus that resembles a classical nuclear localization signal   <cit> . rap <dig>  nuclear import could be mediated by its nls, as is the case for many transcription factors, such as rap <dig>  from arabidopsis  <cit> , oswrky <dig> from rice  <cit> , and ghdbp <dig> from cotton  <cit> . in addition to the nls sequence, rap <dig>  also contains a typical ap <dig> dna-binding domain and an acidic region in its c-terminus, which might act as a transcriptional regulatory domain . the ap <dig> domain contains conserved valine  in the 14th position and glutamic acid  in the 19th position, both of which have been reported as conserved in the dreb subfamily  <cit> . alignment of rap <dig>  against various ap2/erf proteins revealed that rap <dig>  also contains another conserved domain, dlnxxp . this domain is very similar to the ear motif , which has been identified in many transcriptional repressors of various species  <cit> , suggesting that the rap <dig>  might function as a dreb-type transcriptional repressor in arabidopsis.

rap <dig>  binds to the dre element and acts as a transcriptional repressor
to examine whether rap <dig>  could interact specifically with the dre motif, we expressed the n-terminal  <dig> aa of the rap <dig>  protein  as a gst fusion in e. coli, and the purified recombinant proteins were then used for gel mobility shift assays. as shown in figure 1b, the wild-type dre  interacted with the gst-rap <dig>  fusion protein and was retarded on the gel . in contrast, no retardation band was detected for the oligonucleotide harboring the mutant version of the dre element . as a control, gst was shown not to bind with wdre . these results suggested that the rap <dig>  protein could bind specifically to the dre element in vitro. however, it is more important to determine whether dre-binding activity correlates with the transcriptional activity of rap <dig>  in vivo.

as mentioned above, rap <dig>  contains a conserved sequence  similar to the ear-motif, which has been reported as a transcriptional repression domain  <cit> . to determine whether rap <dig>  was capable of repressing dre-mediated transcription, we performed transient expression assay in arabidopsis leaves using a reporter gene containing three copies of the dre sequence from the rd29a promoter, 3×dre-fluc . as shown in figure 1d, expression of rap <dig>  resulted in a substantial reduction of the expression of the reporter gene fluc. further, dreb1a, a well-known arabidopsis transcriptional activator  <cit> , induced activation of fluc by about 7-fold, but co-expression of rap <dig>  prevented this activation . to determine whether the conserved ear-like-motif was important for the rap <dig> -mediated repression, site-specific mutations were made to convert four conserved amino acids  to alanines  . as expected, the ability of rap <dig>  to repress transcription was abolished when the ear-motif was mutated . together, these results suggest that rap <dig>  may function as a transcriptional repressor, and an intrinsic repression domain exists in the c-terminal ear-motif, which contains four conserved amino acids  important for the repression activity of rap <dig> .

rap <dig>  expression is greatly induced by cold and drought stresses
fowler and thomashow  showed that transcript levels of rap <dig>  exhibited up-regulation at low temperatures by microarray analysis  <cit> . to investigate rap <dig>  expression patterns in response to different abiotic stresses, northern blot analysis was conducted using a gene-specific probe for rap <dig> . as shown in figure 2a, the expression level of rap <dig>  was greatly induced by cold and drought stresses, and slightly increased by high salinity stress. in contrast, rap <dig>  expression was not influenced by aba treatment. similar results were also obtained in the aba-deficient mutant aba4- <dig>  <cit> , as shown in figure 2b, indicating that the expression of rap <dig>  was governed via an aba-independent pathway under drought and cold conditions. interestingly, in all tested arabidopsis plants, the elevated expression level of rap <dig>  resulting from 12-h of drought or cold treatment was reduced by 3-h of rehydration .

the promoter sequence of the rap <dig>  gene, with a length of  <dig> -kb , was isolated from the arabidopsis genome. histochemical analysis of the rap <dig>  promoter-driven β-glucuronidase  expression assay is shown in figure 2c . the rap <dig>  promoter was only responsive to cold  and drought  stresses, but not to normal conditions , high salt stress , peg <dig> , or aba  treatments. combining the results from the northern blot and histochemical gus assays, we conclude that expression of the rap <dig>  gene was greatly induced by both cold and drought stresses through an aba-independent regulatory pathway. this conclusion provides the insight that rap <dig>  may play a critical role in modulating plant responses to drought and cold stresses.

rap <dig>  negatively regulates drought and cold stresses in arabidopsis
to investigate the in vivo role of rap <dig>  in modulating plant responses to drought and cold stresses, "loss of function" and "gain of function" phenotypes of the rap <dig>  protein were identified. for loss of function analysis, we used two arabidopsis t-dna insertion mutant alleles of rap <dig> , rap <dig> - <dig>  and rap <dig> - <dig> , in which the t-dnas were inserted into the promoter and 5'-utr regions of the rap <dig>  gene, respectively . both rap <dig> - <dig> and rap <dig> - <dig> were rap <dig>  null alleles, showing no detectable rap <dig>  transcript in either allele by northern analysis, even after 12-h of cold treatment . for gain of function analysis, rap <dig> -overexpressing transgenic lines  were generated using wild-type plants as background. to perform functional characterization of the ear-motif of rap <dig> , we also generated a transgenic line expressing a variant of rap <dig>  in the rap <dig> - <dig> mutant background . this transgenic contained a site-specific mutation that converted the dlnqip ear-motif at positions 143- <dig> to aaaqia at the same position . as a positive control, the transgenic line rap <dig> -2/35s:myc:rap <dig>  was also generated by expressing the wild type rap <dig>  gene in the rap <dig> - <dig> mutant background. for each transgenic, at least five independent homozygous lines with high levels of transgene expression  were identified, and two of these transgenics were randomly selected for subsequent stress tolerance assays.

firstly, wild-type, mutant and transgenic plants were subjected to cold stress. rap <dig>  expression caused increased cold sensitivity, based on growth phenotype  and relative electrolyte leakage assay . after  <dig> weeks of chilling, leaf chlorosis and necrosis were visible in 355s:myc:rap <dig>  plants , but could not be detected in wild type plants . a similar phenotype was also detected in another 355s:myc:rap <dig>  line . the rap <dig>  mutants, rap <dig> - <dig> and rap <dig> - <dig>  displayed significantly better growth than the wild type plants . the phenotype results were confirmed by a relative electrolyte leakage assay. electrolyte leakage from 35s:myc:rap <dig>  plants was approximately  <dig> -fold greater than that of wild type plants under either 4°c or 0°c treatment. in contrast, leakage from rap <dig>  mutants, rap <dig> - <dig> and rap <dig> - <dig>  was only about 70% of that from wild type, even though leakage was similar at the 22°c control temperature . expression of the wild-type allele 35s:myc:rap <dig>  suppressed the cold tolerance of rap <dig> - <dig> plants, while the ear-motif mutated allele 35s:myc:rap <dig> m could not , further confirming that rap <dig>  can function as a negative regulator in plant responses to cold stress and that the ear-motif of rap <dig>  is directly involved in this process.

next, the wild-type, mutant and rap <dig> -overexpressing plants were further subjected to drought stress. for the 2-week-old seedlings, wild type and rap <dig>  mutant plants began wilting  <dig> min after putting them on dry paper, while the transgenic plants overexpressing rap <dig>  could speed up the process, displaying wilt within several minutes. after withholding water for  <dig> h and rehydration for  <dig> h, the mutant plants recovered much better  compared to the wild type plants , while only about a quarter of the 35s:myc:rap <dig>  plants survived  . to test whether the altered drought tolerance of the rap <dig> -overexpressing plants and rap <dig>  mutants might be due to leaf transpiration, water-loss rates were measured. as shown in figure 3f, no significant differences were found between the plants of the three genotypes. a similar phenotype was also detected for another 355s:myc:rap <dig>  line  . together, these results suggest that enhanced or reduced drought tolerance of rap <dig> -overexpressing or rap <dig>  mutant plants likely resulted from altered expression of drought-specific responsive genes via an aba-independent pathway. this would be consistent with the notion that the expression of rap <dig>  is up-regulated under drought conditions by an aba-independent pathway .

rap <dig>  binds in vivo to the promoters of rd/cor genes and regulates their expression
the transcriptional repression activity of rap <dig> , and the effect of altering rap <dig>  expression levels on plant tolerance to cold and drought stresses, suggested that stress responsive genes may be the major targets of rap <dig>  in vivo. previous studies have revealed the presence of dre/crts in the promoters of rd/cor/kin  genes, a class of genes up-regulated by cold, water deprivation, salt stress and aba stimulus  <cit> . we included three genes in our analysis, rd29a/cor <dig>  cor15a, and kin <dig>  the distribution of sites and the core sequences of the dre/crt elements in the promoters of these three genes, as identified with a plant cis-elements database  search, are illustrated in figure 4a .

to determine whether these genes behaved as direct targets of rap <dig>  in vivo, we used a chromatin immunoprecipition  approach, taking advantage of the cold-treated overexpressing transgenic plants, 35s:myc:rap <dig>  , which express a myc-tagged version of rap <dig> . wild type plants with same treatment were used as a control. specific immunoprecipition was conducted with an anti-myc antibody and an anti-his antibody was used as a non-specific igg control. actin was used as a control for the non-dre fragment. as shown in figure 4a , both of the promoter fragments of rd29a  and cor15a , which contained more than one tandem dre/crt, were specifically amplified from the anti-myc immunoprecipitates of 35s:myc:rap <dig>  extracts . however, the kin <dig> promoter fragment , which contained only one dre, could not be recovered from the immunoprecipitates with either the anti-myc or the anti-his antibodies. similar cases were also detected for the actin control fragment. while in the wild type seedlings , there was no myc-tagged protein expressed, and no dna fragment could be detected from neither anti-myc nor anti-his immunoprecipitates. additionally, rap <dig>  binding was quantitatively determined using real-time pcr of immunoprecipitates with either anti-ha or anti-myc antibodies. the results fully corroborated the specific binding of rap <dig>  to these promoters in vivo . both dr and dc fragments included in this analysis showed detectable binding to rap <dig> , while no binding could be detected for the dk and actin fragments.

next, we carried out a transient expression assay to determine whether rap <dig>  could repress the transcription of the reporter gene driven by the dre/crt fragments identified in the chip assay. as shown in figure 4c, the expression results were consistent with the chip results. for the luc reporters driven by the dre fragments of the rd/cor gene promoters, rap <dig>  was able to repress the basal activity of the reporter, as well as expression activity in the presence of an additional transcriptional activator, dreb1a. however, no obvious repression was detected in the reporter driven by the dre fragment from the kin promoter. these data demonstrate that rd/cor genes are likely direct targets of rap <dig>  in vivo.

the rap <dig>  promoter contains three dre/crts arranged in tandem . to test whether rap <dig>  could bind to its own promoter in vivo, specific primers were used to amplify the dre fragments of the rap <dig>  promoter  from the chip immunoprecipitates. as shown in figure 4a, both the fragments were detected in the anti-myc immunoprecipitates. the d <dig> fragment, which contained two dre/crts, was detected at particularly high levels. furthermore, we determined the binding efficiency of rap <dig>  protein to d <dig> and d <dig> fragments by real-time pcr assay. consistent with the above semi-quantitative pcr results, rap <dig>  was more enriched at the d <dig> fragment  than d <dig> , indicating that rap <dig>  binds to d <dig> fragment with higher efficiency than d <dig> fragment . the transient expression assay also showed that the luc reporter, driven by the d <dig> fragment, was repressed by rap <dig>  . this result suggests that rap <dig>  can bind to the dre elements present in its own promoter and repress its own expression, indicating a negative feedback control in the regulation of expression of rap <dig> .

since rd/cor genes were found to be direct targets of rap <dig> , we used quantitative real-time pcr to determine transcriptional levels of these genes in seedlings of wild-type, rap <dig> - <dig> and 35s:myc:rap <dig>  plants under cold  or drought  stresses. in wild-type plants, rap <dig>  mrna accumulation began  <dig> to  <dig> h after exposure of the plants to cold  and reached a maximum expression level at  <dig> h, after which levels of the transcript were maintained . transcript abundance of the rd29a and cor15a genes slowly and gradually increased over  <dig> h, reaching a maximum abundance at  <dig> h after cold treatment. low temperature-induced transcripts were accumulated to a lesser extent in rap <dig> -overexpressing plants than in wild-type. in contrast, transcripts accumulated to greater levels in rap <dig> - <dig> seedlings . the expression of dreb1/cbf genes, the upstream regulators of rd/cor genes, were induced rapidly  by low temperature in wild-type plants, and transcript accumulation increased with cold treatment  <cit> . the expression of dreb1b/cbf <dig> preceded that of dreb1a/cbf <dig> . furthermore, cold-induced dreb1/cbf transcript accumulation was similar in rap <dig> -overexpressing and rap <dig> - <dig> plants, relative to the control wild type over a 24-h time frame . a positive regulator of dreb1/cbf expression, ice <dig>   <cit> , was also detected. ice <dig> transcript abundance was not affected by cold and was similar in the plants of all three genotypes . together, these results indicate that rap <dig>  negatively regulates expression of the rd/cor genes and the dreb1/cbf regulons, but does not alter the transcript levels of drab1/cbfs or ice <dig> during cold stress.

similar results were also detected under drought stress. as shown in figure 5b, drought-induced transcript accumulation of the rd <dig> and cor15a genes to a lesser extent in rap <dig> -overexpressing plants and to a greater extent in rap <dig> - <dig> mutants, relative to the wild type control. the expression of dreb2a and dreb2b were up-regulated with drought treatment in wild type seedlings, as reported  <cit> , and similar expression levels were detected in both rap <dig> -overexpressing and rap <dig> - <dig> plants . atem <dig> , which is regulated by desiccation through a dreb-independent pathway  <cit> , exhibited similar expression patterns in wild type, rap <dig>  overexpression and rap <dig>  mutant plants . these data indicate that rap <dig>  represses the expression of rd/cor genes, but not dreb <dig> genes, under drought stress.

discussion
with many dreb-type transcriptional activators having been characterized, the activation mechanisms mediated by dreb proteins involved in plant stress responses are relatively well studied  <cit> . however, sustained activation of plant stress responses during normal growth or in the absence of any stress is metabolically expensive, and runaway responses are apt to induce damage to cellular components  <cit> . therefore, plants have evolved repression mechanisms to keep such responses under tight control. a key means of maintaining this control is to use transcriptional repressors to control expression of stress-related genes. we have reported a dreb-type, ear-motif-containing transcriptional repressor, rap <dig> , which functions as a negative regulator in plant defence responses to cold and drought stresses, maintaining tight control of these responses.

sequence analysis reveals that rap <dig>  possesses an ap <dig> dna-binding domain . according to amino acid sequence similarity in the ap <dig> domain, rap <dig>  was classified into the a- <dig> group of the dreb subfamily  <cit> . similar to another characterized member of a- <dig> group, ghdbp <dig>  rap <dig>  possesses a transcriptional repression domain, the ear-motif  . in our study, rap <dig>  could indeed repress the basal transcription of luc reporter genes and the transactivation activity of the transcriptional activator dreb1a . this finding suggests that rap <dig>  might behave as an active repressor. multiple possible mechanisms of active repression have been described  <cit> , and the mechanism identified from the studies of an ear-motif-containing repressor, aterf <dig> should be informative. aterf <dig> binds specifically to the gcc-box and recruits atsin <dig> and hda <dig>  a co-repressor and a histone deacetylase, respectively, to the transcription unit. deacetylation of histones by hda <dig> presumably enhances the binding between the histones and their dna targets  <cit> . this kind of repression mechanism through chromatin modification has also been reported for other class ii erf repressors in plants  <cit> . based on the sequence similarity between the conserved dlnqip sequence and the ear-motifs of class ii erfs, rap <dig>  may also recruit such a co-repressor complex to affect repression. additionally, rap <dig>  could repress transcription in the transient expression assays, where the reporter plasmid is not packaged into chromatin in the same manner as a chromosomal gene. similar cases also was reported in aterf <dig>  which could bind to the gcc box and act as a repressor of gcc box-mediated reporter gene transcription in transient expression assay  <cit> . this indicated that chromatin remodeling may be not the unique repression mechanism for rap <dig> . it may repress the downstream gene expression via other mechanism, such as inhibiting the basal transcription machinery at the specific promoter, or interfering the binding of tbp to the specific tata boxes  <cit> , or other unknown mechanisms. therefore, further study is necessary to fully elucidate the complicated repression mechanisms of rap <dig> .

similar to most ear-repressors, which are transcriptionally activated by the signals that they negatively regulate  <cit> , rap <dig>  transcript was induced by cold and drought stresses . expression of the dreb1/dreb <dig> genes in response to cold and drought stresses preceded expression of rap <dig>  . considering the dre-binding and transcriptional repression activities of rap <dig> , we conclude that rap <dig>  acts as a negative "sub-regulon" downstream of the dreb1/dreb <dig> regulatory pathway  <cit> . this conclusion was supported by chip results, which identified rd/cor genes as direct downstream targets of rap <dig>  in vivo . transcript accumulation of rd/cor genes under cold and drought stresses could be repressed by rap <dig>  expression , thus repressing the plant tolerance to such stresses .

reasonably, the activation of rap. <dig> should also be under tight control. we have provided evidence that rap <dig>  can directly repress its own expression, creating a self-inhibitory loop by binding to the dres present in its own promoter. the existence of feedback loops has been described in various cellular pathways, and they provide for the possibility of buffering, allowing for corrections to the cell system when it is perturbed  <cit> . in the case of rap <dig> , it is also possible that this negative feedback loop may contribute to oscillatory expression during stress, preventing over-responses to stress treatment.

combining our results and previous findings, we have proposed a hypothetical model for the role of rap <dig>  in modulating plant responses to cold and drought, as presented in figure  <dig>  once the cold/drought stress signals arise, dreb1/dreb2s are rapidly induced by upstream transcription factors, like ice <dig>  <cit> , or others. next, these transcriptional activators bind efficiently to the dre/crt elements in the promoters of downstream genes, such as rd/cor/kin genes, and switch on the dre-mediated signaling pathway to increase the plants tolerance to the stress. at the same time, dreb1/dreb2s can also up-regulate the expression of rap <dig>  in a direct or indirect manner. the induced transcriptional repressor rap <dig>  binds to the dre/crt elements upstream of the rd/cor genes and represses their expression, thus negatively regulating the plants tolerance to the stress. in addition, the over production of rap <dig>  can be prevented by a negative feedback control mediated by rap <dig>  itself. therefore, the harmonious operation of the dreb-type activators and the rap <dig>  repressor maintain the activation of the rd/cor genes at an appropriate level and the plant stress responses are kept under tight control.

CONCLUSIONS
ear-motif-containing transcriptional repressors play central roles in the transcriptional regulatory cascades of gene expression in stress response. runaway stress responses can be prevented through the activity of these repressors. in this study, we reported the in planta roles of rap <dig> , an ear-motif-containing transcriptional repressor, in modulating plant responses to cold and drought stresses in arabidopsis. rap <dig>  transcript accumulated in response to cold and drought stresses. expression of rap <dig>  negatively regulated plant tolerance to cold and drought stress. these stress hypersensitivities were attributable to the repressed expression of the rd/cor genes, the in vivo direct targets of rap <dig> . also, we identified a self-inhibitory feedback loop in the expression of rap <dig> , which is controlled by rap <dig>  binding to its own promoter and repressing its own transcription. combining our results, we conclude that rap <dig>  acts as a negative "subregulon" of dreb-type activators and is involved in the precise control of expression of stress-related genes, keeping the stress responses under tight control.
