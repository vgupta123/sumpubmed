BACKGROUND
in recent years, annotated genome sequences have become available for many important human and veterinary pathogens, facilitating the exploration of organismal biology. genome-wide microarrays enable a variety of rna- and dna-based queries, contributing to our understanding of genome function and evolution  <cit> . for example, a highly time-resolved expression profiling series through asexual blood stages of the human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum, using spotted oligonucleotide arrays, revealed a transcriptional program tightly coupled to the cell cycle  <cit> , and further studies have elucidated responses to a variety of drug treatment regimens  <cit> . higher density photolithographic arrays provide greater resolution of the transcriptional landscape in p. falciparum, and have been used to assess genomic variation across multiple isolates  <cit> . a newer generation of tiling arrays and 'next-generation' sequencing is expected to support further applications in gene and snp discovery, expression profiling, etc.  <cit> . such studies have helped to drive research efforts in many areas, including the prioritization of targets for drug, vaccines and diagnostic development  <cit> . similar analyses would clearly be valuable for many pathogens, although the development and use of microarrays can be an expensive undertaking.

in order to address the diverse needs of the toxoplasma gondii research community, we have developed a custom affymetrix array for this protozoan parasite, a prominent source of neurological birth defects during congenital infection, and a cause of encephalitis in immunosuppressed patients. t. gondii provides an attractive organism for exploring the utility of mixed use microarrays, for several reasons. first, the parasite genome is relatively small , and an annotated reference sequence is available  <cit> . second, a substantial collection of ests and sage tags from several strains and life cycle stages  <cit>  facilitates the assignment of ~ <dig>  gene models, and provides the basis for validating expression profiling studies. third, ests from multiple strains permits identification of ~ <dig>  candidate snps  <cit> , which have now been validated through additional genome sequencing data that became available in the course of the present study. fourth, while sexual recombination plays a significant role in generating parasite diversity, including variation in virulence and other important phenotypes  <cit> , t. gondii replicates as a haploid, greatly reducing the probe content required for genotyping. finally, while all of the above characteristics apply to other pathogens as well , excellent experimental systems are available for t. gondii permitting cell and molecular biological studies, forward and reverse genetics, and investigation of host-parasite interactions  <cit> .

taking advantage of these features, we have designed a novel multifunctional array which enables the following goals: global expression profiling of parasite genes , and simultaneous analysis of relevant host cell genes; genome-wide high-resolution genotyping; and pilot-scale studies for non-coding regions , alternative expression metrics , validation of gene annotation, and polymorphism and transcript discovery. this array also supports inexpensive and efficient genotyping of malaria parasites, based on ~ <dig> k snps distributed throughout the p. falciparum genome  <cit> . despite the multifunctional nature of the completed array, low cost and ease of experimental use were maintained, maximizing utility for the broader t. gondii and p. falciparum research communities.

we have utilized these arrays to provide the first global view of tachyzoite  stage gene expression for representatives of the three dominant t. gondii lineages found in europe and north america  <cit> , greatly increasing our knowledge of gene expression differences  <cit>  between clonotypes. further, we describe methods for high-resolution genotyping of snps from t. gondii, enabled by complementing non-redundant genotyping probesets with individual expression profiling probes that intersect snps uncovered from recent sequencing of additional t. gondii isolates, validating the utility of a combined expression profiling/genotyping array design. over  <dig>  chosen snps are used to demonstrate high-resolution mapping of crossover points in the progeny of a historical sexual cross  <cit> . additionally, we provide data on select pilot-scale applications, including an exon-level analysis that generally supports the current  toxoplasma gene models, and snp discovery in the t. gondii plastid .

this report describes the design of this novel multifunctional affymetrix microarray, and its use for the aforementioned rna- and dna-based studies relevant to the biology of toxoplasma gondii and plasmodium falciparum. table  <dig> summarizes probe-based design features included on the array, and the following sections provide a brief description of design considerations and selected biological results. overall, this array incorporates both standard and novel designs, several of which may be relevant to studies on other pathogens or organisms. all data is accessible, and may be queried, via the toxodb web site http://toxodb.org.

RESULTS
probe design and selection required balancing space constraints on the array, a desire to employ standard well-supported experimental methods and analysis algorithms, and new opportunities afforded by custom design. standard affymetrix algorithms were used to select probes for traditional applications, including global parasite expression profiling, and genotyping of the several hundred well-characterized genetic markers previously reported for t. gondii. this allows for utilization of readily available protocols and software for labeling, hybridization, and analysis. for gene discovery and high-resolution genotyping applications, power analyses suggested that a lower degree of probe redundancy than commonly used in other systems would be sufficient for t. gondii and p. falciparum, which have relatively small genomes and replicate as haploids. finally, pilot-scale projects were incorporated to generate preliminary data for several additional applications, including a comparison of methods for transcript profiling and analysis, examination of antisense and intron transcription, chromatin immunoprecipitation studies, expression of selected host genes, and polymorphism detection in highly variable genes.

global parasite expression profiling
expression profiling of the ~ <dig>  genes identified in the parasite genome  is of general interest to the t. gondii research community, enabling the correlation of isolate-specific differences in gene expression with differences in virulence, drug sensitivity, differentiation, and other aspects of parasite biology  <cit> . in order to facilitate such experiments, using commonly available reagents and analysis tools, we employed a standard gene expression profiling design, using eleven 3'-biased probes per gene  <cit> . a perfect match only  design was selected, as software supporting such designs is widely available, and exhibits comparable performance to mismatch corrected  schemes across a wide dynamic range  <cit> . the accuracy of expression measures based on pm-only design was confirmed using exogenous spike-in controls, and by pm-mm analysis of genes on chromosome ib . in addition to profiling the nuclear genome, the mitochondrial and apicoplast genomes were tiled at  <dig> nt density on alternating strands , allowing comprehensive expression analysis for these organellar genomes.

as indicated in table  <dig>   <dig>  t. gondii genes were annotated in the draft  <dig> nuclear genome sequence, and 3'-biased pm expression profiling probes were designed for all of these genes. in order to evaluate array performance, transcript abundance for in vitro-cultivated t. gondii tachyzoites was compared with information available from three alternative sources:  random cdnas from large-scale unbiased est sequencing projects  <cit> ,  cdna abundance inferred by sage   <cit> , and  a microarray study using spotted clones corresponding to ~ <dig> genes  <cit> . because none of these methods was carried out at sufficient depth to identify all transcription units, evaluated transcripts were binned into three groups based on expression level . as shown in additional file  <dig>  this analysis shows good concordance between our array and each of the other three platforms, given our selected binning, over a dynamic range of >100-fold in transcript abundance, indicating reliable performance of the new array.

to provide a first global view of expression across the entire t. gondii genome, we profiled the rapidly growing lytic tachyzoite stage of three parasite strains  = type ii; veg = type iii), representing the major clonal lineages that define parasite populations and pathogenesis phenotypes in the us and europe  <cit> . expression levels were assessed using the robust multi-array average algorithm , which summarizes hybridization signals from multiple probes per gene into a single expression value, and present/absent  calls were made as described in methods. these p/a results exhibit 83% concordance with calls made by affymetrix's original mas <dig> detection algorithm on chromosome ib, for which mm probes are available . as indicated in table  <dig> , these studies identified a total  <dig>  genes that are expressed in tachyzoite-stage parasites cultivated in vitro  -- a significant improvement over the  <dig> transcripts identified on glass slide arrays , in sage tag libraries , or est libraries . proteomic studies suggest a similar level of expression  <cit> .

 <dig> number of toxoplasma ests in dbest, unique sage tags in tgsagedb, and probesets on the microarrays.

 <dig> values in parentheses reflect a more stringent criteria for evidence of expression: > =  <dig> sage tags or ests vs. > = 1; 150% above background vs. > 0% above background; 5% fdr vs. 10% fdr for affymetrix arrays.

 <dig> some genes have more than  <dig> associated probeset, differing in degree of potential cross hybridization.

biological replicates display extremely high concordance across the full range of expression, as shown in figure 1a. the accompanying tables list genes exhibiting the most highly discordant hybridization patterns in pairwise between-strain comparisons . interestingly, these lists are highly enriched in rhoptry proteins, which are known to play important roles in parasite virulence and pathogenesis  <cit> . note, however, that many rhoptry proteins are also highly polymorphic, which may in some cases affect hybridization profiles, since expression probes on the array were based on the sequence of type ii strain me <dig> .

extracting all genes exhibiting differential expression in any pairwise comparison at a p-value of 10- <dig>  yields a total of  <dig>  genes . further filtering to exclude genes that changed <2-fold, were unexpressed , or were interrogated by a highly polymorphic probeset ; see genotyping methods for a description of how polymorphic probes were identified), leaves  <dig>  genes displaying statistically significant between-strain differences in expression . of these, a single outlier strain could be assigned for  <dig>  genes; as indicated in figure 1c, rh is the outlier in 23%, pru in 27%, and veg in 9% of this set. down-regulation is much more common in pru , while no statistical significance is detected with respect to direction of regulation in rh or veg.

 <dig> high-level biological process gene ontology annotations  were available in the draft  <dig> t. gondii genome annotation, including  <dig> of the  <dig>  genes differentially regulated between strains . a hypergeometric test was used to detect over- or under-representation of go classifications at a significance p-value threshold of  <dig>  among expressed genes, or differentially expressed genes between strains. for example, rna metabolism is statistically over-represented among expressed genes , but most of these are not differentially expressed in tachyzoites cultivated under constant conditions in vitro, suggesting that rna metabolic activity is a relatively conserved or steady function. however, dna metabolism is under-represented in expressed and differentially expressed genes, while protein metabolism is over-represented in both categories. analysis of distribution by strain suggests that genes involved in protein metabolism are particularly over-represented in prugniaud parasites, as are cell cycle genes in veg, perhaps reflecting the passage history and/or biological phenotypes of these strains.

 <dig> multiple go annotations are available for some genes, and some go annotations map to multiple go slim categories .  <dig>  genes include  <dig>  go annotations, corresponding to  <dig>  go slims, for a total of  <dig>  gene-go slim mappings.

 <dig> assessed using a 10% false discovery rate .

 <dig> differential expression determined as described in the text. p-values represent enrichment for go slim terms, as determined by the hypergeometric distribution . green shading implies under-representation, while yellow shading implies over-representation.

global high-resolution genotyping
in the field, t. gondii populations are characterized by a largely clonal structure, with most strains isolated from north america and europe falling into one of three dominant clonotypes referred to as types i, ii, and iii  <cit> . these clonotypes show low intra-lineage polymorphism, but inter-lineage polymorphism of ~1-2%. variation is dominated by biallelic polymorphisms, and several hundred well-characterized rflps, microsatellites, and other markers have been used to map the genetic basis of lineage-specific phenotypes such as virulence  <cit> . genotyping by rflp analysis is laborious, providing a bottleneck for mapping studies. we therefore incorporated probes for hybridization-based snp genotyping onto the microarray, taking advantage of available space left over after the design of probes for expression profiling.

three sets of probes are available for genotyping analysis at increasing resolution, as indicated in figure  <dig>   <dig> of the  <dig> previously described markers could be mapped to individual snps, as indicated by triangles . these  <dig> snps were interrogated using standard affymetrix protocols  <cit>  including  <dig> probes/snp:  <dig> quartets , each representing pm and mm probes for both alleles. consistent with the strategy articulated above, this design enables high confidence genotyping of previously-published markers using off-the-shelf genotyping software.

an additional  <dig>  putative polymorphisms were identified based on est sequences from various parasite strains  <cit> , as indicated by the upper set of vertical bars on chromosomes in figure  <dig>  the  <dig> probe approach to genotyping these snps would undoubtedly provide a high level of statistical power for distinguishing alleles, but at a high cost, as incorporating all of these probes would necessitate a larger array format , or a genotyping-specific array. although t. gondii is a diploid organism that undergoes meiosis during sexual recombination, mitotic replication occurs as a haploid. as a result, clonal parasite isolates are homozygous at every locus, eliminating the need for heterozygote discrimination. the intuition that haploid genotyping should require fewer probes was confirmed by typing known snps using data from the hybridization of  inbred mouse strains to a densely-tiled resequencing array. as shown in figure 3a, hybridization of a single pm probe centered on the snp was able to correctly distinguish between two alleles for >70% of select snps in the mouse genome . performance falls off with distance from the snp, dropping below 50% accuracy at ±  <dig> nt. performance of adjacent snps on the same strand was highly correlated: as shown in figure 3b, when one probe fails, a probe offset by  <dig> nt succeeded <25% of the time, and the best performing same-strand probes  were able to recover snp detection only ~35% of the time. similar observations have been made against the plasmodium genome  <cit> . in contrast, opposite strand probe hybridization was less-highly correlated: when one probe failed, the 0-offset probe from the opposite strand could successfully recover ~60% of snp calls. as a consequence, the vast majority of snp detection signal derives from just two probe pairs: one probe for each allele on each strand. a recent study reports similar conclusions using human genotyping data  <cit> . this four-probe strategy was therefore employed for the  <dig>  snps inferred from t. gondii est data, and also for probes for  <dig>  coding sequence snps identified in the plasmodium falciparum genome  <cit>  .

the final tier of genotyping design takes advantage of the fortuitous overlap between the  <dig>  expression-profiling probes described above and  <dig>  snps identified by whole genome alignment of three parasite genome sequences ; additional file 3). when these additional genomes became available , it was determined that  <dig>  expression profiling probes encompass snps. as  <dig> probes were used per gene for expression studies, and most analysis algorithms are quite robust with respect to individual outliers in the data, these polymorphisms have little impact on expression profiling . such single feature polymorphisms  provide a high density set of probes for interrogating polymorphisms, however, albeit at reduced confidence relative to the 4- and 40-probe designs, as they are based on a single probe for a single allele, and not necessarily centered on the snp .

these three classes of snp analysis probes were screened to remove probesets that failed to consistently yield correct calls across a training sample spanning all three lineages .  <dig>  of the snps analyzed using  <dig> probes  passed this screening .  <dig>   of the snps analyzed using the  <dig> probe strategy  passed screening, validating this more-efficient strategy for snp detection, while  <dig>   of sfp probes passed the filtering step. note that the percentage of probesets retained is not a measure of accuracy, as excluded probesets usually make no call, rather than calling the incorrect allele. in aggregate, a total of  <dig>  typable t. gondii genetic markers are represented on the array, and accuracy for those snps carried forward is >95%. this corresponds to an average density of  <dig> snp per  <dig> kb genome-wide, representing an ~20-fold increase in resolution over prior genotyping efforts. plasmodium falciparum snps were screened using a training set comprised of four strains , yielding a total of  <dig>  snps, confirming that the strategy of using two probes per allele is not sensitive to the extreme at-bias of plasmodium .

the complete set of  <dig>  typable toxoplasma snps was used to genotype recombinant f <dig> progeny resulting from an experimental cross between the type i gt <dig> strain and the type iii ctg strain  <cit> . array-based genotyping identifies distinct cross-over points  that are ~99% concordant with the original analysis based on  <dig> rflp markers . the arrays are significantly faster and cheaper, however, and provide much higher resolution. for example, all  <dig> previously-identified cross-over points in progeny clone a6af were confirmed, at >5-fold higher resolution. four additional breakpoints were also discovered . in a few cases, individual probes also suggest small cross-overs , although these have not been verified experimentally. similar results were obtained for several other progeny , and characterization of the complete set of available progeny is currently in progress.

in a further illustration of the potential for multiplexing provided by multifunctional chip design, it is interesting to note the potential for using genetic marker probes that fall within coding regions for genotyping in the course of rna hybridizations. as shown in additional file  <dig>  reliable calls can be made for ~ <dig> highly expressed polymorphic coding sequence loci that lie close to 3' end of genes. while insufficient for high resolution genotyping, these data provide a useful, inexpensive, first-pass indication of probable genotype, helping to guard against inadvertent strain contamination.

snp discovery 
sequence differences distinguishing specific loci have historically been used to discern evolutionary relationships amongst toxoplasma isolates  <cit> . as an alternative to traditional sequencing, resequencing arrays provide a rapid means for base-calling using dna hybridization signals. in typical resequencing arrays, a gene is tiled densely with probes, with each pm probe accompanied by the  <dig> possible mm probes allowing the correct sequence of the target dna to be determined. lower density tiling can also be informative , through the identification of sfps rather than specific sequence differences. simulations using mouse resequencing data showed that high performance could be achieved by tiling pm probes only, at  <dig> bp density. a further  boost was observed by alternating the strand of adjacent probes . as indicated in table  <dig> ,  <dig> target genes were selected for tiling based on published and unpublished data indicating their utility for strain typing. several introns were also tiled, in order to determine rates of neutral mutation. in addition, the entire apicoplast genome and a draft mitochondrial genome  were tiled at  <dig> bp resolution.

dna hybridizations were used to identify apicoplast sfps, revealing  <dig> type iii sfps ,  <dig> type ii sfps , and no type i sfps, as indicated by diamonds in figure  <dig>  the paucity of type i snps has been reported before  <cit> , and likely represents the sexual history that gave rise to these lineages. these polymorphisms permit the macro-gametic parent to be identified for each of the progeny in the i × iii cross shown in figure  <dig>  as indicated in the table inset, both parental strains produced both macro- and micro-gametes in this cross. rna hybridizations also support the presumed operon structure inferred from gene organization, although the high degree of variability in adjacent probes remains unexplained .

exon-level analysis 
investigating the performance of standard 3'-biased probesets vs. all exon arrays, or antisense expression, would require higher density interrogation than could be justified for a low-cost array. these applications were therefore enabled for a small portion of the genome, allowing the generation of pilot-scale findings to be used in the consideration of future array designs. chromosome ib was selected to provide telomere-telomere analysis as it is a single, small  chromosome, exhibiting hundreds of strain polymorphisms   <cit> . figure  <dig> illustrates a  <dig> kb span from chromosome ib, displaying the variety of probes available for this portion of the genome , including  six probes for each exon for every predicted gene,  five probes for each predicted intron, and  probes to assess the importance of antisense transcription . in addition, probes were tiled at a  <dig> nt resolution across a ~ <dig> nt span upstream of seven selected genes, enabling pilot-scale chromatin immunoprecipitation studies . although not investigated in this paper, the availability of both standard 3'-biased probesets and probes for all exons on chromosome ib permits a comparison of alternative methods for evaluating gene expression  <cit> ; 3' probes may be less sensitive to differences in mrna isolation procedures, but aggregate expression signals from every exon might be less sensitive to hybridization artifacts afflicting the 3'-region.

in addition to providing an alternative measure of expression, exon-level profiling also enables testing of gene model validity, an issue of some concern as ~60% of current t. gondii gene models are based solely on computational predictions, without support from experimental evidence such as ests or sage tags . probe-level analysis often provides a clear distinction between exons and introns. for example, the bottom track in figure  <dig> supports the computationally-predicted gene model. considering chromosome ib in its entirety, ~64% of all predicted exons were called as present at a 10% false discovery rate . in addition, as shown in figure 7b, exon-level 'present' calls are highly consistent within a gene: for genes where at least two exon-level probesets were available, ~33% showed expression of all annotated exons, and 23% showed no expression of any exon . interestingly, among the 44% of multi-exon genes exhibiting discordant expression profiles, exon-level present/absent calls often group together, suggesting alternative gene models, as in the case of the kinesin motor domain-containing protein  shown in figure 7c, where the first seven predicted exons are not expressed, while the last seven are. it is interesting to note that this interpretation is consistent with a recent study on chromatin marks, which suggest two distinct promoters at this locus  <cit> . exon intensities may also suggest differentially spliced transcripts, which have previously been reported in t. gondii  <cit> .

transcript discovery 
the current set of t. gondii gene annotations represent the results of an algorithm designed to detect consensus gene structures based on several ab initio and homology-based gene finders  <cit> , and mapping of an extensive est library, followed by limited manual curation  <cit> . although gene finding has improved in recent years, tiling arrays and deep sequencing have revealed that the level of transcription in most eukaryotic genomes often exceeds what is represented in existing annotation  <cit> . in order to identify promising regions  in which to search for unannotated genes, the entire reference t. gondii genome was filtered to identify:

 unannotated sequences that map to consensus sequences derived by est clustering  containing at least  <dig> ests, yielding  <dig>  regions.

 unannotated orfs with significant blastx hits to the non-redundant genbank database  <cit> , yielding  <dig>  intergenic orfs  that overlap an hsp  by more than  <dig> nucleotides.

 unannotated orfs  that are significant matches  for the query set of orthomcl ortholog database sequences using tblastn, resulting in  <dig> orfs.

statistical analysis of human spike-in data suggested that a tiling density of  <dig> bp would be sufficient to reliably detect missed exons across a useful dynamic range of target concentrations . the  <dig> kb span displayed in figure  <dig> shows moderate expression associated with an unannotated orf  that hits a hypothetical protein in plasmodium yoelli , and two adjacent unannotated est clusters exhibiting high expression.

host expression profiling 
most of the intended applications for this microarray focus on the biology of t. gondii, but parasite pathogenesis clearly involves alterations in host cell/organism expression as well. several key players involved in host adaptive and innate immune responses to t. gondii have been reported  <cit> , and a small-scale transcriptional profiling study identified additional genes  <cit> , but the complete host transcriptional profile during t. gondii infection is unknown. in order to permit evaluation of host immune responses, we included both human and the corresponding mouse orthologs  for  <dig> host genes on the array, representing a comprehensive set of cytokines, chemokines, receptors, and other genes likely to function at the parasite-host interface . pm-only probesets were derived from the human u133plus  <dig>  and mouse  <dig>  <dig>  arrays  <cit> . this collection provides parasitology researchers with an economical opportunity for studies that may not require genome-wide expression profiling, and the opportunity to explore expression changes in both host and pathogen in parallel. to permit unambiguous detection of signals from parasite vs. host mrna, parasite gene expression probes were pruned to minimize the potential for cross-hybridization to human or mouse mrna sequences, and preliminary analysis indicates essentially no reduction in specific signal when a 100-fold excess of host rna was included in parasite expression profiling studies .

discussion
this report describes a multifunctional microarray supporting a wide range of studies on the protozoan parasite toxoplasma gondii . expression profiling confirms previous results obtained on various platforms , allowing analysis to be extended genome-wide . the perfect match only design employed for this array compares favorably with a small-scale analysis including mismatch controls , and preliminary results indicate that small differences in sensitivity at low expression levels can be restored using a pool of surrogate mismatch probes selected on the basis of nucleotide composition . exon-level analysis , generally support the overall accuracy of t. gondii gene models. tiling of regions with significant blast or est hits, but no current gene call, allow the interrogation of additional transcriptionally active regions . all of the expression profiling data described in this report has been deposited with ncbi's gene expression omnibus , and loaded into toxodb.org  <cit> , enabling a wide-range of queries. for example, users may wish to compare genes identified by est, proteomics, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and microarray analysis. the availability of whole genome expression profiling arrays is expected to facilitate a wide range of studies on stage-specific expression, mutant characterization, etc.

comparative analysis of expression levels in representatives from each of the three lineages that dominate t. gondii populations in the us and europe  <cit>  shows that ~49% of the  <dig>  t. gondii genes identified in draft  <dig> annotation are expressed in tachyzoite-stage parasites , implying that approximately half of the genome may function exclusively in the latent or sexual life stages. as demonstrated for tachyzoite transcriptional profiling, the microarray described in this paper can identify and prioritize genes that play key roles in these other life stages for further functional studies. for example, tachyzoite-to-bradyzoite stage transition experiments have yielded a robust set of genes that appear to be involved in early bradyzoite differentiation .

it is interesting to note the unusually low variance observed in biological replicates , perhaps reflecting the homogeneity of the intracellular niche occupied by these parasites. these studies also reveal substantial differential expression between lineages , with ~26% of expressed genes showing significant differences in at least one strain . secreted proteins known to play an important role in virulence  <cit>  are particularly notable for their extreme inter-strain differences in gene expression . toxodb employs strain-specific library files  that eliminate polymorphic probes to avoid false positives due to snps in determining differential expression.

the most unusual aspect of this study is the incorporation of both expression profiling and genotyping probes on the same array, broadening the utility of this chip for biological analysis. standard array-based genotyping strategies  were modified in light of the discovery that same-strand probes are largely redundant , particularly for haploid t. gondii parasites. probesets including only  <dig> features passed high-stringency screening nearly as frequently as  <dig> feature probesets , but are much more economical, improving t. gondii genotyping from the > <dig> kb resolution currently available using  <dig> rflp markers  <cit>  to ~ <dig> kb .  <dig>  well-validated p. falciparum snps were also included on this array, providing an economical means for genotyping of the most lethal human malaria parasite  <cit> .

sequences for two additional t. gondii isolates were released subsequent to chip production, revealing > <dig> k biallelic snps . 33% of expression profiling probes that fortuitously overlap snps passed the strict quality control parameters established for genotyping, despite the absence of a complete probe quartet centered on the snp, providing an additional ~ <dig>  reliable genotyping markers . using the entire set of  <dig>  typable markers to evaluate the progeny of a cross previously analyzed by standard methods  <cit>  revealed ~99% concordance, while mapping crossovers to higher resolution and identifying several additional recombination points . it will be interesting to investigate the several instances of apparent micro- and telomeric crossovers identified in this analysis. higher resolution genotyping at lower cost should greatly facilitate qtl and other genetic mapping studies  <cit> .

numerous other features were included on this multifunctional array , including surrogate mismatch probes to facilitate background subtraction , and probes for array-cgh studies on the tiled apicoplast genome. apicoplast sfps were used to demonstrate uniparental inheritance, with either parent able to provide the macrogamete ; transcript profiling  supports the proposed operon model for transcription of this organellar genome  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the driving motivation for this array design was to support low cost whole genome expression profiling for the protozoan parasite toxoplasma gondii, by reducing standard chip size , and eliminating mismatch probes . this reagent has been widely adopted by the t. gondii research community. excess space available on the array was exploited to support high resolution, low cost genotyping, taking advantage of the discovery that  <dig> feature probesets are nearly as effective as  <dig> feature probesets. the multifunctional nature of this array has provided many unexpected advantages, including the opportunities to exploit expression profiling probes as sfp markers, and the ability to use genotyping probes for strain validation during rna hybridization experiments. many of the principles employed in this design are applicable to other species.
