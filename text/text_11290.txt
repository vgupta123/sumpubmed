BACKGROUND
analysis of mutant phenotypes has been the major means to reveal gene functions in molecular biology  <cit> . currently, in the era of post-genomics, it is anticipated to translate mutant phenotypes into gene functions based on high-throughput data  <cit> . in immunology, mutant phenotypes have to be translated into gene functions, while taking into account the classification and functions of many interrelated, immune cell subsets, each of which shows dynamic changes in gene expression depending on its differentiation and activation status. this issue is now being recognised in molecular immunology  <cit> , and new methods are required to be developed, in order to understand, based on high-throughput data, the features of cells from mutants in the context of well-characterised differentiation programmes.

in fact, with the expansion of the immune cell classification and the number of available mutant strains, immunological data are becoming more and more multidimensional , and each measurement can be high dimensional . in addition, it is common in immunological genomic data that the number of experimental groups is larger than that of replicates , because of large numbers of experimental groups. thus, it is a major and unique problem in immunology that multidimensionality  further complicates the famous problem of high dimensionality  in transcriptomic analysis  <cit> .

in order to analyse such multidimensional data across different experiments, currently the gene signature approach is commonly used in immunology. signature is defined by the characteristic expression of a set of genes in a particular cell subtype . however, when multiple subsets are simultaneously analysed, the signature approach is not sufficient by itself and can be misleading, because different signatures can be highly correlated to each other. thus, the overuse of multiple signatures may further complicate the problem of multidimensionality, and different gene signatures should be properly compared and analysed considering their interrelationships and multidimensionality. principal component analysis  can provide a useful insight to such a multidimensional problem, but pca primarily visualises the overall structure of the whole dataset, where uninteresting effects  can often dominate those of interest  <cit> . gene network analysis is often used for the functional analysis of transcriptomic data, and can provide powerful tools for the cross-analysis of multiple datasets  <cit> . this type of approaches, however, focuses on associations between gene profiles of cells and particular processes within the framework of gene networks, which are usually dependent on annotation database or literature-extracted information  <cit> . these dependencies are not suitable for investigating totally new and unknown pathways, or examining common, but incorrect hypotheses. thus, it is hoped to develop a data-oriented method that reveals the cross-level relationships of genes, cells, and multiple differentiation programmes in a transparent manner.

in this study, we have adapted canonical correspondence analysis  to cross-analyse a transcriptomic dataset of interest  and another transcriptomic dataset  that defines cellular differentiation programmes. cca measures and visualises similarities  between elements across three different levels: genes, cells, and differentiation programmes. mathematically, cca uses linear regression and singular value decomposition , and thereby identifies the linear combinations of explanatory variables that maximise the dispersions of samples in response variables  <cit> . thus, cca effectively deals with the complexity of immunological genomic data in terms of cell subsets and functions analysed. this type of complexity is defined as multidimensional in non-biomedical disciplines such as ecology and sociology, and accordingly, multidimensional analyses including cca have developed and widely used in these areas  <cit> . we recently reported the first adaptation of cca to microarray data  to visualise the cross-level relationships between pathological and physiological processes for addressing haematological problems  <cit> . in the current study, we have further extended and developed the use of cca, so that it effectively analyses a common immunological problem: to identify the functional defect of mutant cells.

we have analysed transcriptomes of cd4+ t cells for t cell differentiation in this study. it is known that cd4+ t cells, upon antigenic stimulation, differentiate into functionally distinct t cell subsets including interferon-gamma -secreting helper t cell- <dig> cells , interleukin -4-secreting th <dig>  il-17-secreting th <dig> cells, and foxp3-expressing regulatory t cells , depending on the cytokine and morphogen milieu  <cit> . the lineage-specific transcription factors have been identified for each t cell subset: t-bet for th <dig>  gata <dig> for th <dig>  rorγt for th <dig>  and foxp <dig> for treg . accordingly, the expression of cytokines and these transcription factors has been commonly used for determining the identities of t cells in terms of their differentiation. on the other hand, recent advances in genomics have revealed that cellular differentiation is not governed by a few dedicated transcription factors, but depends on the activities of multiple transcription factors, almost all of which are expressed and used for other differentiation programmes  <cit> . thus, transcriptomic analysis is expected to provide better solutions for fully characterising, and elucidating the identity of, immune cell subsets.

RESULTS
overview of cca methodology
in this study, cca has been adapted to analyse transcriptomic data and thereby specifically identify which differentiation programme  is disturbed in undefined cell subset x . currently, the typical approach for this problem is to analyse the transcriptomes , and interpret the results of the analysis by current knowledge  on the genes that are related to d . on the other hand, the proposed approach first decomposes the original hypothesis into two parts, “cell subset x is defective…” and “…in the differentiation programme d,” based on which two transcriptomic datasets are prepared. next, cca is applied to the transcriptomic data x, using the dataset for d  as explanatory variables. the standardised matrix of x, s, is projected onto z, and thus, the projected space qs is the interpretable part of the main data x by the explanatory variables. svd is applied to qs, producing sample and gene scores . differentiation programmes are visualised as regression coefficients between z and the new axes. these results are visualised as a triplot that show relationships between cell subsets, genes, and differentiation programmes, facilitating hypothesis-generation based on the interpretation of data in a data-oriented manner .figure  <dig>

cca was originally developed by ter braak for analysing data of fish species in various locations in the ocean in the context of ‘environmental gradients’ , in order to visualise the relationships between the geographical location , fish species, and environmental gradients in the ocean  <cit> . in our method, we define gene expression as the amount of transcripts occurs at each gene , and assume that transcripts are measured at those sites by microarray or rna-seq experiments for cellular phenotypes . transcriptomes of well-defined, differentiated cells represent differentiation programmes , and the gene expression profiles of those cells are used as explanatory variables. mathematically, cca projects the main dataset onto explanatory variables, and perform svd in the projected space using the algorithm of correspondence analysis , which is a weighted pca in the chi-square metric  <cit> .

while visualisation is the primary strength of cca, we have developed a new approach for characterising and classifying samples using cca by introducing differentiation variable as explanatory variable, which is equivalent to environmental gradient by ter braak  <cit> . here we assume that a cell phenotype x can change into the one of another cell phenotype y. considering that explanatory variables are used for regression, differentiation variable d is defined as the responses of a set of transcripts when a cell changes its phenotype from x to y, d = μy – μx , using mean gene expression profiles of x and y, μx and μy, which is equivalent to environmental gradient by ter braak  <cit> . thus, within-group variations in the explanatory data are not considered in cca, and the data needs to have sufficiently large between-group variance and small within-group variance, as typically seen in immunological genomic data. when only one differentiation variable is used as explanatory variable, cca provides one-dimensional solution, which can be used as a new scoring system for the association of genes and samples with the differentiation programme.

we have analysed two immunological problems using two sets of transcriptomic data in this study. in each analysis, we first examine the visualisation ability of cca and elaborate how cca results can be interpreted. next, we compared the classification ability of cca with other classification methods. table  <dig> summarises the characteristic of datasets used in this study.table  <dig> 
datasets used in this study




exemplary analysis : identify the major effect of gata3-deletion on t cell differentiation
in this analysis, we analysed an rna-seq dataset of gata3-ko and wt t cells including th <dig>  th <dig>  th <dig>  and itreg  and a microarray dataset that analysed the same th subsets from wt mice . the purpose of this analysis is to identify which th differentiation programme is most disturbed by the deletion of the gata <dig> gene. the results of pca using these datasets are shown in figure  <dig>  confirming good separations of sample classes, although they do not provide insights into the function of gata <dig> figure  <dig>

sample and gene score analysis using cca triplot
cca was applied to the gata <dig> dataset, using the th dataset as explanatory variables. cca clustered th <dig>  th <dig>  th <dig>  and itreg rna-seq samples in the first  <dig> axes . the main features of the sample relationships are, however, mostly contained in the first  <dig> axes, which occupied 87% of the constrained inertia. cca triplot shows the correlations between genes, cell samples, and differentiation programmes . in other words, the more correlated, the nearer the components are positioned on the map  <cit> . biplot values of the cca result in figure 3b  were different from the sample scores of pca of the th dataset in figure 2b, indicating that cca has provided a unique solution. the th <dig> and th <dig> differentiation programmes  were correlated with their corresponding rna-seq samples . all t cell subsets from the rna-seq data and their specific genes were associated by cca .figure  <dig>

remarkably, gata3-wt th <dig> cells had high negative values in axis  <dig> and  <dig>  with which well-known th <dig> genes including il <dig>  il <dig>  and il <dig> were associated, while gata3-ko th <dig> cells did not . although th <dig> cells showed a difference in gata3-ko and wt, other th cells did not show any obvious difference, suggesting that the effect of the gata3-deletion was more obvious in th <dig> and th <dig> differentiation.

cca using pca scores as explanatory variables
next, we applied cca to the gata <dig> dataset, using pca gene scores of the th dataset as explanatory variables, in order to obtain further insights on the cca results. the sample and gene relationships were mostly similar between the cca results using the original explanatory variables and pca gene scores , presumably because pc <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> contained more than 98% of the total variance. biplot values of differentiation programmes  in figure 3d can be mostly explained by the linear combinations of th sample vectors in the pca result in figure 2b: pc <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> represent the difference between itreg and all others, between th <dig> and th <dig>  and between th <dig> and both th <dig> and th <dig>  respectively. this result confirms the linearity of cca, which dimensions are intentionally defined as linear combinations of the explanatory variables  <cit> .

cca results by differentiation variables
in order to further examine the correlations between samples and the th <dig> and th <dig> differentiation programmes, we analysed the gata <dig> dataset using corresponding differentiation variables. using a th <dig> differentiation variable, the cca solution showed that wt th <dig> cells had the highest scores, while ko th <dig> and other th cell populations had low scores . on the other hand, cca analysis using the th <dig> differentiation variable showed that, although wt th <dig> cells had the highest scores, there was only a small difference between wt and ko th <dig> cells . percent explained variance  was similar between two analyses . thus, even considering that the overall dispersion of the th <dig> score was approximately 30% larger, the difference between wt and ko in the th <dig> score was most remarkable in these two analyses.

comparison of cca with other classification methods using the gata <dig> dataset
using the gata <dig> and th datasets, the classification ability of cca using a differentiation variable was compared with other classification methods: linear and non-linear support vector machines , linear discriminant analysis , k-nearest neighbor , naïve bayes , and random forest . the th dataset was used as a training data , and wt data from the gata <dig> dataset was used as a test data. thus, we addressed how efficiently those classification methods identify th transcriptomes from rna-seq data, based on those from microarray data. table  <dig> shows the results of these analyses. using various numbers of genes, cca had high sensitivities  and good accuracies . thus, cca outperformed, or at least was equivalent to, other classification methods.table  <dig>

exemplary analysis : identify the functional defect of stat3-ko t cells in t cell differentiation
in this section, we analysed a dataset of stat3-ko and wt t cells in various culture conditions  and the th dataset . previous reports showed that wt t cells differentiated into th <dig> in the presence of il- <dig>  while stat3-ko t cells did not  <cit> . thus, the purpose of the analysis is to address whether cca and other methods can reveal that th <dig> differentiation was most disturbed in stat3-ko t cells. in addition, we examined whether cca can reveal hidden associations between genes, samples, and differentiation programmes.

analysis of the stat3-ko dataset by conventional approaches
first, we used the signature approach with hierarchical clustering and pca as competing methods, in order to address these problems. gene signatures for th <dig>  th <dig>  th <dig>  and itreg were generated using the th dataset by an empirical bayes test. hierarchical clustering showed that only the itreg signature clustered wt t cells cultured with il- <dig>  whether with or without tgf-β , which are known to differentiate into th <dig> cells  <cit> . this result, however, is difficult to be immunologically interpreted. next, pca was applied to the stat <dig> dataset . the first  <dig> axes occupied 56% of total variance, but sample relationships in these  <dig> axes were apparently not immunologically meaningful. thus, both the signature approach and pca failed to reveal the features of stat <dig> ko t cells.

cca sample score analysis
axis  <dig> occupied 64% of the constrained space, and explained major variations in this analysis. wt.il <dig> and wt.il <dig> tgfβ showed high scores in axis  <dig>  while all other samples including stat <dig> ko t cells with the same conditions were negative. among the th differentiation programmes , th <dig> differentiation programme showed the highest positive correlation with axis  <dig>  and the itreg differentiation programme strongly and negatively correlated with axis  <dig> .

thus, cca succeeded in identifying the known fact that wt.il <dig> and wt.il <dig> tgfβ differentiated into th <dig> cells, while stat <dig> ko t cells failed  <cit> . in addition, the th <dig> differentiation programme showed the second most positive correlation with axis  <dig>  and thus, with wt.il <dig> and wt.il <dig> tgfβ .

cca gene score analysis
based on the analysis above, genes with high scores in axis  <dig>  were presumably related to either or both of th <dig> differentiation and stat <dig> signalling. in fact, they were enriched with th17-related genes:  well-known th <dig> genes such as il <dig>  il17a, klrd <dig>  stat <dig>  fosl <dig>  serpinb1a, rora, rorc, and maf were high positive ; and  more than 70% of th <dig> signature genes by yosef et al. <cit>  had positive values in axis  <dig> . in addition, many of these cca top-ranked genes were related to either or both of th <dig> differentiation and stat <dig> signalling by preceding studies .

cca results by differentiation variables
in order to further address which differentiation programme is most correlated with the defect of stat3-ko t cells, we applied cca to the stat <dig> dataset using th17/itreg and th2/th <dig> differentiation variables . the cca solution using a th17/itreg differentiation variable showed that wt.il <dig> and wt.il <dig> tgfβ had higher scores  . th2/th <dig> differentiation variable did not provide meaningful results . top-ranked genes in axis  <dig>  were highly expressed in wt.il <dig> and wt.il <dig> tgfβ  and in th <dig> cells  by a heatmap analysis. collectively, cca revealed the relationship between stat3-ko and wt t cells and those different programmes in a data-oriented manner.

comparison of cca with other classification methods using the stat <dig> dataset
in this last section, the classification ability of cca was compared with other classification methods using th dataset as a training data , and the stat <dig> dataset was used as a test data. we addressed how efficiently those classification methods identify th <dig> differentiated t cells in the stat <dig> dataset, based on the resource dataset. using various numbers of genes, cca had high sensitivities and accuracies and outperformed, or at least was equivalent to, other classification methods . this result was confirmed using a jackknife method, where multiple test datasets were generated by leave-one-out from the stat <dig> dataset .figure  <dig>

discussion
methodological considerations
in typical immunological hypotheses, genes and cell phenotypes are correlated with immunological processes, and accordingly, genomic data are often ‘filtered’ for the immunological processes of interest . this is typically achieved by selecting a set of genes based on the analysis of experimental data, annotation database, or literature-extracted information on protein-protein regulation network  <cit> . here cca uses a linear regression to identify the interpretable part of the main data  and finds a solution within the constrained space, while ignoring the non-interpretable part of the data   <cit> . thus, cca is more transparent in its operation, and less dependent on the literature, comparing with the methods above, and thus can be used for the experimental study that analyses rare phenomenon or addresses controversial hypotheses. in addition, with the regression approach, cca is implemented with the basic structure of hypothesis-oriented study: hypothesis can be usually decomposed into two parts, the main part and its biological context, which are analysed by cca as the main and explanatory data . this may explain why cca worked more efficiently than pca, which cannot incorporate the layered structure of biological hypothesis. in addition, cca worked more efficiently than pca, presumably because cca analyses the constrained space, so that the result that cca produces is biologically meaningful. on the other hand, there are drawbacks of the proposed method. explanatory variables cannot include highly correlated variables, because they are used for regression. in addition, sample variations in the resource dataset that defines explanatory variables are ignored. therefore, cca is primarily suitable for the analysis of undefined cells in relation to the differentiation programmes that are represented by well-defined cell subsets. it seems that immunologists empirically know that their data have small within-group variance and large between-group variance , and most of immunological genomic datasets have no more than duplicate or triplicate . using such data, pca gene scores may serve well as explanatory variables for cca as shown in figure 3d, if the dimensionality of the data can be reduced in a biologically meaningful way.

cca had high sensitivities for identifying correlated samples in the cross-analysis of two datasets . this may be because cca identifies and analyses only the part of the main data that can be explained by another dataset . in addition, correspondence analysis, an underlying algorithm of cca, primarily concerns correlations: it assigns high negative/positive values to genes that show high correlations to specific samples, while allocating low negative/positive values to non-correlated elements  <cit> . thus, presumably cca is efficient in identifying the cell samples that show high correlations to a differentiation variable. on the other hand, cca showed relatively lower accuracies comparing with its remarkably high sensitivities . in fact, cca is not designed to deliberately discriminate groups, as other classification methods are  <cit> , but aims to measure the distance  between samples in a space with reduced dimensionality, while maximising their overall dispersions  <cit> .

the proposed method assumes that gene expression is the measurement of transcripts at each gene , which represents a local ‘activity’ for a cell phenotype, and the total set of those transcripts  collectively shapes the cellular phenotype. thus, cca uses two matrices with genes in rows and samples in columns, and the genes must be the same between the two matrices . although it is often recommended to have samples  in rows and genes  in columns so that sample size is considered  <cit> , it is in fact a common practice to apply pca to a matrix with genes in rows and samples in columns, in order to analyse genes in the sample space  <cit> . this is geometrically a sensible way to apply pca to transcriptomic data, considering that, by definition, the number of principal components cannot exceed the number of samples or genes, either of the smaller ones  <cit> , and that pca is a procedure to reposition the origin at the centroid of the points in a multidimensional space and then to rotate the coordinate axes in such a way as to satisfy the maximal variance property  <cit> . in other words, when the number of genes is much larger than that of samples, the coordinate axes can be meaningfully rotated only in the sample space. thus, our method analyses the sample space that is constrained by differentiation programmes as explanatory variables, providing sample and gene spaces with new coordinate axes. the comparison of those two spaces has been extensively studied as the theory of the duality diagram, which is implemented in the cran package ade <dig> <cit> .

immunological considerations
in the original report of the dataset gse <dig>  the data were mostly mined by venn diagram analysis, and the authors emphasised gata3-mediated gene regulations in all the analysed t cell subsets   <cit> . on the other hand, cca identified that the deletion of gata <dig> had the largest impact on th <dig> differentiation, and also suggested that it had some effects on th <dig> differentiation. in fact, gata <dig> has been closely linked to th2: th <dig> differentiation is totally abolished in vitro and in vivo by the conditional deletion of gata <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, gata3-ko th <dig> cells were closer to th <dig> cells than wt th <dig> cells in our analysis , which may be, at least partly, related to the increase of th1-specific genes including tbx <dig> and il12rb <dig> in gata3-ko th <dig> cells  <cit> . the dysregulation of th <dig> genes in gata3-ko th <dig> cells may be due to the opposing interaction between tbet and gata <dig>  <cit> : gata3-ko t cells may have an aberrant activity of tbet, which also explains the possible effect of gata3-deletion on th <dig> differentiation . thus, cca has provided a useful bird’s eye view on the gata <dig> dataset. further studies on the time course of differentiating th <dig> and th <dig> transcriptomes, using wt and gata3-ko, may reveal how this differentiation programme is activated and how gata3-deletion affects the programme.

cca identified the th <dig> differentiation programme as the most disturbed process in stat3-ko t cells. this result is compatible with the findings by durant et al., which showed that stat <dig> was required for th <dig> differentiation by in vivo and in vitro experiments using stat3-ko t cells  <cit> . the cca result also indicated that the most correlated process of stat3-ko t cells was the itreg differentiation programme . considering that th <dig> and itreg differentiation are mutually controlled by il- <dig> and il- <dig>  respectively, at the cytokine level, and by rorγ-t and foxp <dig>  at the transcription factor level  <cit> , stat3-ko t cells may have a stronger tendency to differentiate into itreg. interestingly, durant et al. observed that stat3-ko mice produced larger numbers of treg in experimental colitis than wt mice  <cit> . in addition, cca identified that th <dig> differentiation was the second most disturbed process in stat3-ko t cells . in fact, th <dig> and th <dig> are highly related processes: before the emergence of th <dig>  th <dig> had been thought to cause autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalitis and arthritis, which are nowadays more associated with th <dig>  <cit> . in addition, stat <dig> is functionally related to th <dig>  whether positive or negative: the th <dig> cytokine il- <dig> activates not only stat <dig> but also stat <dig>  <cit> ; stat3-ko mice show either enhanced or decreased th <dig> response depending on the experimental settings  <cit> . recently, the interrelation between th <dig> and th <dig> has also been studied for their plasticity and stability, confirming their close associations  <cit> . cca also showed that wt t cells with il- <dig> in the absence of tgf-β were correlated with th <dig> genes including ccr <dig>  il12rb <dig> and gzma. il- <dig> in the absence of tgf-β is known to less stably induce il-17a production, and t cells have a more th1-like phenotype  <cit> .

immunological studies may become more robust against confirmation bias if proper multidimensional techniques are introduced  <cit> . confirmation bias is widely known in sociology, politics and psychology, and is defined as the seeking or interpreting of evidence in ways that are partial to existing beliefs, expectations, or a hypothesis in hand  <cit> . it is the bias behind our research practice, not a statistical bias, being introduced not only by our own nature but also by the peer review process  <cit> . when analysing complex multidimensional data, researchers can easily pick up small differences between samples in favour of their hypothesis , while ignoring the major trends in the data. cca can fight this bias by visualising the relationships of samples and/or genes and thereby facilitating interpretations with minimal assumptions, as demonstrated in this study.

CONCLUSIONS
the proposed method can be used for revealing the cross-level relationships between genes, samples, and biological processes of interest based on two transcriptomic data. the visualisation of the result that cca produces is essential, relating undefined cells to known biological processes and genes, and thereby unravelling complex relationships between multiple phenotypes and genotypes. thus, cca can provide a platform  that facilitates the generation and refinement of hypothesis. in addition, cca can have a high sensitivity for identifying the differentiated cells in a dataset that are similar to the ones in another dataset. these unique features make cca competitive with other existing methods. the proposed method can be applied to a wide range of biological problems, providing effective solutions for multidimensional problems with multiple phenotypes and functions.
