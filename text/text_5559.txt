BACKGROUND
the genome of hexaploid wheat  is one of the largest in the grass family. the 2c dna content of hexaploid wheat is  <dig>  pg, about  <dig> and  <dig> times the genome size of rice  and arabidopsis thaliana, respectively  <cit> . based on dna re-association studies the non-repetitive dna fraction is estimated to be about 17% of the wheat genome  <cit> , or hypothesized to be as low as 1% based on available sequence data analysis and genome size in relation to other plant genomes  <cit> . the repetitive, non-genic regions of wheat, as in many plant genomes, primarily consist of transposable elements   <cit>  and to a much lesser extent of pseudogenes  <cit> . during the past few years, about  <dig>  triticeae te sequences have been discovered and deposited in the database for triticeae repeats .

first discovered by barbara mcclintock  in maize, tes have been reported to be present in all genomes analyzed, with similarities even among life kingdoms  <cit> . tes are discrete sequences in the genome that can multiply and/or move within a host genome  <cit> . class i tes, which include long terminal repeat  retrotransposons and non-ltr transposons, are transcribed into mrna that is subsequently reverse transcribed into dna by a reverse transcriptase. class ii tes, which are dna transposons, including terminal inverted repeats  transposons, miniature inverted repeat transposable elements  and helitrons, move as dna molecules that are excised from a genomic position and integrate elsewhere  <cit> . tes are now recognized as important contributors to genomic organization and as major drivers of genome evolution. centromeric and pericentromeric regions mainly consist of tes  <cit> , which may play an important role in centromeric stability and heterochromatin maintenance  <cit> . induced activation of tes resulted in altered chromosome segregation and meiotic disruption in mouse  <cit> , loss of sister chromatid cohesion in yeast  <cit>  and loss of centromere condensation in a. thaliana  <cit> .

active tes constitute a major source of mutations in the genome. transposition of a te can result in altered gene expression  <cit> , generation of novel regulatory networks  <cit> , gene deletions  <cit> , gene duplications  <cit> , increases in genome size  <cit> , illegitimate recombination  <cit>  and chromosome breaks and rearrangements  <cit> . because of the potential harmful effects of active tes, the expression of most tes in the genome is suppressed so that, even if whole and capable of autonomous transposition, most tes remain silent throughout the plant's life cycle  <cit> . only few naturally active tes have been identified so far  <cit> . nonetheless, te-derived sequences are abundant in wheat cdna libraries  <cit>  and activation of tes has been observed under conditions of biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . te expression is silenced both at transcription and after transcription through epigenetic mechanisms  <cit> .

tes can be transcriptionally silenced by dna methylation and repressive chromatin formation, involving modifications of histone tails and altered chromatin packing  <cit> . post-transcriptional silencing of tes is achieved by the degradation of te transcripts by rna-degrading complexes  <cit> . small non-coding rnas , generated when double-stranded rna  is cleaved by proteins belonging to the dicer family, guide the sequence-specific silencing after transcription  <cit> . srnas are also involved in dna methylation of homologous dna sequences in the nucleus  and heterochromatin formation, guiding the silencing of te at the transcriptional level  <cit> . the function of srnas is related to their length: if 21-nt long, silencing is post-transcriptional, whereas if 24-nt long, silencing is mediated by rna-dependent dna methylation and heterochromatin maintenance  <cit> . tes are mobilized in caenorhabditis elegans mutants that are defective in rnai  <cit>  and in mutants of a. thaliana that are deficient in dna methylation and chromatin structure regulation  <cit> . beside te-silencing, the srnas are involved in a wide variety of biological phenomena, ranging from developmental processes to responses to biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> .

high-throughput sequencing has greatly facilitated the analysis of srna sequences. massively-parallel sequencing platforms allow the identification of hundreds of thousands of srnas in any organism  <cit> . profiles of srna collected from  <dig> species of higher plants, including wheat, are now publically available http://smallrna.udel.edu/.

in wheat, fast rates of te insertion and deletion result in rapid turnover of intergenic regions, which can affect neighbouring genes  <cit> . this fast mutation frequency, together with the high tolerance to mutations of a polyploid genome, accounts for the genomic dynamism and adaptability of wheat  <cit> . regulation of te expression in the wheat genome has not been studied in detail. in this study, we report the analysis of the different classes of srnas originated from the different known classes of tes in wheat, their target regions within the repetitive elements, and their impact on the methylation patterns of the targeted regions.

RESULTS
sequencing of srnas and comparison to extant public libraries
to investigate the relationship between srnas and tes in wheat, we constructed an srna library from leaves of t. aestivum and developed a database that included our library plus the three libraries of srnas from t. aestivum that were publicly available at http://smallrna.udel.edu/. we sequenced  <dig> , <dig> srnas , which were then combined with  <dig> , <dig> srnas from t. aestivum leaves , as well as  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> srnas from t. aestivum healthy  and fusarium-infected spikelets , respectively . the resulting database is composed of  <dig> , <dig> srna sequences , with a bimodal size distribution with peaks at 21-nt  and 24-nt . since libraries were from different tissues and developmental stages some variability was observed in the abundance of the  <dig> and 24-nt classes, which are summarized in the additional file  <dig> table s <dig> 

the hexaploid wheat used to construct the tae <dig> srna library expressed an rnai construct under the 35s promoter that targeted the endogenous no apical meristem  gene  <cit> . the presence of this rnai transgene caused a 40% reduction in expression of the target genes as measured by quantitative rt-pcr  <cit> . out of  <dig> , <dig> srnas in the tae <dig> library,  <dig>   perfectly matched the targeted nam sequence in the rnai construct reflecting the efficacy of the silencing construct . no srna from the other libraries made from non-transgenic materials matched the target nam gene. we cannot rule out the possibility that the rnai may cause other effect on the srna population.

distribution of srna counts within annotated bac sequences
to explore the distribution of srnas in relation to both the sequences from which they originated and their potential targets, we mapped the srnas from the four libraries present in our database onto five completely-sequenced genomic regions, three from tetraploid wheat  and two from hexaploid wheat . five entirely annotated genomic regions, eu <dig>   <cit> , dq <dig>   <cit> , ef <dig>   <cit> , ef <dig>   <cit> , and dq <dig>   <cit>  obtained by sequencing  <dig> bacterial artificial chromosomes  were chosen. altogether, these regions  include  <dig>  tes  and  <dig>  genes. the gene density of these genomic regions ranges from  <dig> gene per  <dig> kb in ef <dig> to  <dig> gene per  <dig> kb in eu <dig>  similar to that observed in other wheat gene-rich regions  <cit> .

a scrolling window analysis  was done to identify all srnas that perfectly matched the genomic sequences. table  <dig> shows the distributions of the counts of srna mapping to the annotated tes and genes in the three t. turgidum genomic regions, eu <dig>  dq <dig>  and ef <dig>  and the two t. aestivum sequences ef <dig> and dq <dig>  tes and gene coordinates within each of the five regions and the relative srna counts are reported in additional file  <dig> tables s2- <dig>  the number of perfectly matching srnas ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>  srnas  . similar profiles of srna distribution on tes and gene-encoding regions was observed in the three genomic regions from t. turgidum and the two of t. aestivum: ninety three percent of the total srnas  that matched these genomic regions matched te sequences , whereas only  <dig> %  matched the gene-encoding regions . a statistical comparison of the srna/bp in tes and gene regions showed highly significant differences .

*  <dig> of these match to a single gene annotated as a predicted leucine rich repeat gene.

within the tes, class i and class ii tes showed a similar srna density . however, 74% of the srnas that matched the class ii tes, correspond to the miniature inverted repeats transposable elements , which account for only  <dig> % of the class ii tes and, thus, have a significantly higher srna density than class i and the rest of the class ii tes .

many of the tes present in the analyzed regions are organized in nested structures that include up to four layers of nested insertions, with the relative position in the nested structure providing an estimate of their relative insertion times  <cit> . we observed a significantly higher number of srnas matching the tes that were at the top of the nested structures compared to the number of srnas that were associated with elements at the lower, more ancient layers of the nested structures .

comparison between the predicted methylation pattern of tes and genic regions
because tes accounted for most of the srnas in the genomic regions analyzed and transcriptional silencing, including cytosine methylation, is directed by srnas  <cit> , we hypothesized that a higher level of cytosine methylation would be present in the repetitive elements than in the single-copy regions associated with genes, such as untranslated regions  and introns. we used an in silico approach that took advantage of the different mutation rates of methylated c to infer the methylated regions  <cit> . methylated cytosines display higher frequency of mutation than non-methylated cytosines because of a 10-fold increase in transition rate due to the passive deamination of methylated cytosine into thymine  <cit> . in plants, c methylation can occur not only in cg di-nucleotides , as observed in mammals, but also in chg and, less frequently, in chh tri-nucleotides, where h is a, t, or c  <cit> .

we were able to use this approach only for the  <dig> kb vrn <dig> region, for which we had orthologous sequences from the t. monococcum a m genome bac ay <dig> and the t. turgidum a genome bac ef <dig> . the two orthologous regions were aligned and compared to count the number of mutations in potentially methylated sites .

we developed a computer program, "cmet scan" , to classify all the c and g sites as cg, chg, and chh and to count the transitions that occurred at these sites between the two aligned sequences. the percent of mutations in pms is used here as a proxy to infer the prevalence of methylation in a genomic region. exonic sequences were excluded from the analysis to minimize the effect of selection on mutation frequencies. our analysis confirmed that the overall frequency of mutations  was higher in pms than in non-pms sites. the observed number of mutations per nucleotide was approximately 20-fold and 11-fold higher in pms than in non-pms sites in tes and in intronic and untranslated regions, respectively. the average percentage of cg, chg, and chh sites that underwent transitions was 2-fold higher  in tes than in intronic and untranslated regions . this difference between tes and intronic and untranslated regions was also reflected in a higher transition to transversion ratio in the tes  relative to the intronic and untranslated regions . this difference was the result of a higher transition frequency in the tes versus the intronic and untranslated regions , with no apparent difference in the frequency of transversion .

to analyze how the different rates of mutation affected the sequence divergence of the repetitive elements with time, we calculated the divergence rate per mya using a previous estimate of  <dig>  mya of divergence between the t. monococcum and wheat a genome in the vrn <dig> region  <cit> . this estimate was based on the kimura two-parameter method   <cit>  and a mutation rate of  <dig>  x  <dig> - <dig> substitutions per synonymous site per year for the intronic and low copy number regions . analysis of the orthologous tes adjusted for the same divergence time resulted in a mutation rate of  <dig>  x  <dig> - <dig> substitutions per synonymous site per year.

using the previous rate, we calculated the hypothetical insertion times of the ltr retrotransposons in both of the homologous regions of t. monococcum and t. turgidum, assuming that the two ltrs are identical copies of the same template at the time of insertion  <cit> . estimates of insertion time were possible for  <dig> elements with intact pairs of ltrs,  <dig> in t. turgidum and  <dig> in t. monococcum . similarly to the comparison between orthologous transposable elements in the vrn <dig> the transition rate was approximately 2-fold higher than the transversion rate.

distribution of srnas among tes
to extend our study to more tes than those present in the five sequenced genomic regions, we analyzed the targets of the srna among the repetitive dna sequences deposited in the triticeae repeat sequence database . the complete trep database  contains sequences for  <dig>  triticeae tes, of which  <dig>  are complete elements. from the complete elements, we selected  <dig> that belong to the genera triticum and aegilops, and, among those, the  <dig> that include no ambiguous base calls . the results from the query of the sequences of these  <dig> elements for perfect matches to our srna database are detailed in additional file  <dig> table s <dig> and summarized graphically in figure  <dig>  and additional file  <dig> figure s <dig> . copia elements showed the highest srna counts, about 2-fold higher than mariner tes and about 3-fold higher than gypsy tes. of the srna perfectly matching copia tes, 93% matched angela  and wis  tes, which also showed the highest median srna counts per element . among the gypsy tes, the ones with highest median srna counts where wham  and sabrina , but together accounted only for 38% of the total srna that matched gypsy tes, reflecting the higher diversity of abundant gypsy tes. caspar, clifford, hamlet, and jorge tes accounted for 69% of the srnas perfectly matching cacta tes. among mariner tes, thalos mites showed the highest median srna count per element  and alone accounted for 44% of the srna matching its superfamily.

to see if the differences in srna counts were correlated with the abundance of the elements, we estimated the number of tes from the different classes in the wheat genome using the trep database. in the complete trep database, the class i ltr retrotransposons copia  and gypsy , and the class ii elements mariner  and cacta  are the most abundant te superfamilies, accounting together for about 80% of all tes . accordingly, the tes belonging to these superfamilies displayed the largest number of srnas counts, accounting for 97% of the  <dig>  srnas that perfectly matched the  <dig> selected te sequences. these perfect matches included  <dig>  srnas per copia element in trep,  <dig> per gypsy,  <dig> srnas per cacta, and  <dig> srnas per mariner, suggesting an excess of srna matching copia elements. the correlation between element abundance in the trep database and total srna counts per element was r =  <dig>  , and increased markedly to r =  <dig>   when copia tes were excluded from the analysis.

data are expressed as percentage of the total values per column.

to determine whether copia tes were underrepresented in the trep database  compared to other te superfamilies, such as mariner  and gypsy , we estimated the abundance of tes in triticum by analyzing  <dig> annotated bacs . in the  <dig> , <dig> bp analyzed, gypsy tes were the most abundant  followed by mariner  and copia . this frequency distribution was very similar to the one found in the trep database . the higher abundance of gypsy relative to copia was confirmed in a 1x shotgun sequencing of the complete hexaploid wheat genome . in summary, all the different estimates of te copy number confirmed that at least six times more srnas matched individual copia than gypsy elements.

we also studied the representation of the different te superfamilies in the ncbi collection of t. aestivum ests . the number of tes in the est libraries is expected to be proportional to their abundance in the rna population and, thus, related to their transcriptional activity. database searches were carried out using the blastn search tool with an e-value threshold of 1e - <dig> for cacta, copia, line, gypsy, and of 1e - <dig> for mariner, harbinger, and mutator tes to account for the smaller sizes of the latter. correlations between srna matches and te representation in the est database showed a similar pattern to what was observed in the correlations with the genomic data: overall, srna counts significantly correlated with blastn hits in the est library only if copia were excluded from the analysis .

when the total number of counts was replaced by the counts per bp , the stowaway mites and the mariner superfamily showed the highest density of srna counts , which was about 10-fold higher than copia tes, 65-fold higher than gypsy tes, and 47-fold higher than cacta tes . in addition to the highest match density, the mariner tes presented a different pattern of srna sizes than the other groups . mariner tes were the only class for which 21-nt srnas  matches exceeded 24-nt srnas matches , whereas for all other classes of tes 24-nt matches were higher than 21-nt matches.

distribution of srnas within tes
to explore whether srnas preferentially matched specific regions of each te, we divided the nucleotide sequence of each element of the copia, gypsy, cacta and mariner superfamilies present in the trep database, into ten equal sections and determined the number of srnas that perfectly matched each section . about 70% of the 24-nt srna matching the large ltr tes was concentrated in the first and last 10%  and 20%  of these elements, corresponding to the ltrs. this observation was supported by the analysis of single elements . chi square tests averaging the duplicated ltr classes showed that the distribution of srna matches over the ten intervals differed significantly from a uniform distribution .

complete cacta elements are flanked by short terminal repeats  that terminate in the cacta motifs  <cit> . cacta elements also contain sub-terminal repeats in direct and inverted orientation . sub-terminal repeats typically lack sequence conservation between different families. about 50% of the srnas matching the cacta elements matched the first and last 10% of these elements, which was also significantly different from a uniform distribution . the distal 10% corresponds to the trs and adjacent sequences as suggested by the analysis of individual caspar tes .

wheat stowaway mites represent the largest group within the mariner superfamily. they are small , non-autonomous elements that end in well conserved tirs that comprise the majority of their structure. about 93% of the srnas matching this group of tes are targeted to the tirs. the higher frequency of srna in the 3'-tir is likely due to a larger number of 5'-truncated elements in the trep database . the analysis of the individual mite stowaway thalos 103h9- <dig>  shows a symmetric distribution of the 21-nt srna matches . in this element, the perfectly paired regions of the tirs are the main target of the srna. in contrast, the different mite thalos 42j2- <dig> has two nucleotide changes in the 3'-tir  that greatly reduce the srna counts in this region. in thalos bq620108- <dig> a single nucleotide change in the 5'-tir also reduces srna counts .

discussion
many wheat srnas target transposable elements
the profile of srnas perfectly matching the five wheat genomic regions analyzed here suggests that many wheat srnas are produced from tes. these results are in general agreement with whole-genome studies of other plant species, in spite of the fact that the five analyzed regions comprise only  <dig>  ×  <dig> - <dig> % of the wheat genome  and were selected from gene rich regions providing only a partial view of the wheat genome. in arabidopsis thaliana most of the srnas correspond to transposons and repeats, and the highest densities of 24-nt srna-matching regions were detected in the centromeric and pericentromeric regions, where dna transposons and retrotransposons are highly abundant  <cit> . in rice, large numbers of srnas originate from retrotransposon or transposon-related sequences  <cit> . our analysis is limited to gene-rich regions of the wheat genome and we cannot rule out that a different profile of perfectly matching srnas is present in gene-poor regions, which represent most of the wheat genome.

in spite of the preponderance of srnas matching tes in the five genomic regions analyzed here, a search of the trep database perfectly matched only 6% of the srnas in our consolidated wheat srna database. many of the non-matching srnas likely originate from intergenic regions  <cit> , pseudogenes  <cit> , or gene coding loci  <cit> , but many may match undiscovered te families or members of known families that have sufficiently diverged from their representatives in trep. most of the wheat genomic regions currently deposited in genbank are the result of map-based positional cloning efforts and, therefore, are focused on gene-rich regions, whereas a large proportion of tes are present in gene-poor regions  <cit> . although this bias is likely reflected in the tes currently present in trep, the relative abundance of the different superfamilies in trep was confirmed by the analysis of 1x shotgun sequencing of the complete hexaploid wheat genome . in addition, by considering only perfect matches, our analysis may not include an adequate sampling of the diversity of te sequences within families and may underestimate the srna targets, since some srnas can be also effective against imperfectly matched targets  <cit> . the wheat tes with the highest number of perfectly matching srnas include the class i copia and gypsy retrotransposons and the class ii mites, which are also likely the most abundant tes in the wheat genome . a similar situation is observed in barley where the srnas matching the copia, gypsy and cacta tes account for 83% of the perfect matching barley srnas and together represent more than 50% of the matches to the random sequencing of 1% of the haploid barley genome  <cit> . however, the correspondence between te abundance and number of perfect matches to the srnas is not perfect. in the sampled genomes of both wheat and barley, gypsy tes  are more abundant than copia tes , but the number of srnas with perfect matches is higher in copia  than in gypsy  tes. based on the different estimates of te abundance it can be estimated that 6- to 8-fold more srnas match copia than gypsy tes. their relative levels of expression cannot explain this difference since the abundance of tes from these two classes in the est collections seems to be proportional to the number of copies . since most of the srnas are targeted to the ltrs we speculated that longer ltrs in the copia relative to the gypsy tes could provide an explanation. however, this was not the case since, although very variable in size , average ltr lengths were longer in gypsy  than copia  tes. in summary, the excess of srnas matching the copia tes remains to be explained.

different classes of wheat tes are targeted by different classes of srnas
the 24-nt srna are involved in rna-dependent dna methylation and heterochromatin maintenance and thus suppress transcription from dna, whereas the 21-nt srnas regulate the half life and translation of related mrnas  <cit> . it is interesting that most of the te-matching srnas in wheat belong to the 24-nt group, whereas mites are preferentially matched by 21-nt srnas.

these results suggest that the activity of mite tes is regulated primarily after transcription, while the activity of all the other te families is regulated by repression of transcription. in addition, the restricted targeting of the 21-nt srnas observed within the tir regions of mites is more similar to the pattern of regulatory srnas in a. thaliana and rice than to the more dispersed distribution of 24-nt srnas  <cit> . unlike other tes, mites often occur in 5' or 3' utrs of genes and sometimes even integrate in the coding sequences  <cit> . in consequence, mites are often expressed as read-through transcripts  <cit> . mites are flanked by short tirs joined by little or no spacer dna  <cit>  that when expressed as rna form a highly stable hairpin loop, which can then be recognized and processed by the rna interference enzymes into mature 21-nt rna  <cit> .

the preponderance of 21-nt mite srnas in polyploid wheat contrasts with the preponderance of 24-nt mite srnas reported in diploid plant species  <cit> . wheat is a recent polyploid with a high level of gene redundancy, and therefore, has a high tolerance to genic mutations  <cit> , which may allow the accumulation of mites in genic regions. besides introducing a target site for silencing, the insertion of a te in a coding region may introduce an alternative polyadenylation site when located in the 3' utr, affect mrna stability and translation initiation, or interfere with the normal splicing pattern and perturb the functionality of the resulting protein  <cit> .

retrotransposons and dna transposons other than mites were preferentially associated with 24-nt srnas. as in the case of mites, in dna transposons such as the cacta elements, read-though transcription and intramolecular pairing of inverted repeats may underlie the generation of dsrna and consequently of srnas  <cit> . the higher srna counts matching the terminal repeats, including the subterminal inverted repeats may reflect not only the higher degree of conservation of these regions  <cit> , but also a mechanism of srna generation based on the formation of terminal dsrna loops.

in the case of the class i tes, dsrna can be generated by rna-dependent rna polymerase   <cit>  or by intermolecular pairing of antiparallel transcripts  <cit> . for example, the bidirectional transcription of retrotransposons leads to the generation of srnas and to silencing in human cells  <cit>  and in drosophila melanogaster  <cit> .

srnas match specific areas of the repetitive elements
the srnas matching wheat copia and gypsy tes were concentrated in the ltrs , a pattern also observed in maize  <cit> . ltrs do not encode for known proteins, but contain the promoters and terminators required for the transcription of the retroelement and are partially transcribed  <cit> .

the significantly larger proportion of srnas matching ltrs may simply reflect the higher abundance of ltrs relative to the internal domain region in the genome. in addition to the natural duplication of the ltr at both ends of the te, the inter-ltr region is eliminated in a large proportion of tes resulting in solo-ltrs. for example, barley contains an average of  <dig> solo-ltrs per internal domain  <cit> . the significantly larger proportion of srnas matching ltrs might also indicate a higher chance of antiparallel pairing of these repetitive regions, or that ltrs are targeted by rdrp, or that the plant-specific dna dependent rna polymerase iva  at the dna level uses ltrs as template to generate srnas  <cit> .

regions targeted by srnas have higher rates of mutation
the presence of abundant srnas matching tes suggests that epigenetic mechanisms are involved in the silencing of their expression and motility in wheat. the srna-metabolic pathway guides both the de novo methyltransferases to initiate dna methylation at direct repeats  <cit>  and the maintenance methyltransferases responsible for remethylation and the maintenance of the transgenerational stability of the heavily methylated repetitive elements  <cit> . in a. thaliana, 24-nt srnas are generated by the dicer-like  <dig> protein and, when loaded in one of the ten argonaute proteins, ago <dig>  target dna methylation  <cit> .

in plants, srnas induce methylation of not only cg dinucleotides, which are the primary sites of methylation in mammals, but also cytosines in the chg and chh sequence contexts  <cit> . our estimations of dna methylation based on transition rates parallel the higher methylation of cytosines in the cg and chg contexts compared to chh observed in arabidopsis  <cit> . in wheat, tes are preferentially methylated compared to introns and untranslated genic regions in agreement with studies in a. thaliana, maize, and primates  <cit> . the importance of dna methylation is evidenced by the dramatic increase in te transcription observed in methylation-deficient mutants of a. thaliana  <cit> . methylated cytosine may affect te expression either directly by interfering with the proper binding of proteins involved in transposition or indirectly by recruiting methylcytosine binding proteins that in turn associate with complexes containing co-repressors and histone deacetylases that modify chromatin structure  <cit> .

in addition to the rapid and reversible te repression, dna methylation can irreversibly inactivate tes by increasing the mutation frequency of the methylated sites. methylated cytosines spontaneously deaminate to form thymine at a faster rate than non-methylated cytosines in the same sequence context  <cit> . based on the estimated divergence time between t. monococcum and t. turgidum of  <dig>  mya  <cit>  and an estimated nucleotide substitution rate in the introns and untranslated regions of  <dig>  x  <dig> - <dig> nt - <dig> year - <dig>  <cit> , we estimated that the substitution rate was  <dig>  x  <dig> - <dig> nt - <dig> year - <dig> in the tes , which is about three times faster than the substitution rate in the untranslated genic regions. this estimate is almost identical to the one obtained previously for a different wheat genomic region  <cit> . this higher substitution rate in tes is paralleled by a significantly higher transition rates but not any difference in the rate of transversions. thus cytosine methylation and subsequent transition account for the faster substitution rate observed in the tes.

the sequence erosion initiated by dna methylation may account for the smaller number of srnas derived from older tes relative to the number from more recently inserted tes . the higher mutation rate in methylated tes together with high rates of deletions in the intergenic regions may contribute to the permanent inactivation of tes,  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our study provides a first exploration of the wheat epigenome and its close connection with the tes that compose the vast majority of the wheat genome. our findings suggest that srna-directed transcriptional and post-trascriptional silencing suppress te activity in the wheat genome. dna methylation and the consequent increase in the mutation rate at the methylated sites may silence tes more permanently.
