BACKGROUND
uniparental inheritance , also known as maternal inheritance in oogamous organisms, is a phenomenon generally observed in sexual eukaryotes  <cit> . upi of mitochondria means that one parental mitochondrial  dna population is not transmitted to the sexual progeny. consequently, this process eliminates heteroplasmy defined as the state in which a mixture of parental mt genomes coexists in a zygote. elimination can occur either prior to fertilization , during or after fertilization  <cit> . the underlying mechanisms, however, are diverse and little understood  <cit> . recently, two studies have provided molecular evidence that autophagy is involved in selective elimination of sperm-associated mtdna in fertilized eggs of the nematode caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> . autophagy is a cellular degradation process by which cell constituents including organelles are enclosed in double-membrane vesicles termed autophagosomes for subsequent disposal in lysosomes or vacuoles  <cit> . hereby, the ubiquitin-like protein atg <dig>  is required for autophagosome formation and essential for non-selective  as well as selective autophagy such as autophagy of mitochondria   <cit> . in one study, both lgg- <dig> and lgg- <dig> were silenced in hermaphrodites of c. elegans. interestingly, subsequent fertilization resulted in survival of male-specific mtdna in the developing embryo  <cit> . in the other study, hermaphrodites of either c. elegans wild-type or lgg- <dig> null mutant were fertilized. again, only in the mutant background paternal inheritance was detected  <cit> . in both studies, male partners carried a polymorphic mtdna to specifically detect paternal inheritance by pcr. these studies have pointed out a requirement of autophagy in the effective elimination of paternal mitochondria. based on the use of lgg1/ <dig> mutants, however, this study did not address the possibility of whether the observed phenotype specifically relied on the loss of mitophagy.

previously, we have investigated upi in the basidiomycete smut fungus ustilago maydis  <cit> . this fungus can either grow yeast-like by budding or undergo a sexual cycle, which is initiated by fusion of two mating-compatible isogamous cells. sexual identity is governed by a tetrapolar mating-type system, constituted by the a and b loci. the a locus exists in two alleles, a <dig> and a <dig>  which encode a pheromone/receptor-based system providing for nonself recognition and fusion of mating partners. the multiallelic b locus controls subsequent sexual development of the dikaryon. in addition, completion of the sexual cycle and formation of diploid teliospores is intimately coupled to biotrophic growth within the host plant maize  <cit> . upi of mtdna has been detected as post-fusion event during development of dikaryotic cells. as a result, inheritance of a2-associated mtdna  dominates, while a1-associated mtdna  is efficiently lost from the progeny. the outcome of upi is determined by the a <dig> mating-type locus genes lga <dig> and rga <dig>  specifically, lga <dig> controls selective loss of the m <dig> mitotype, while rga <dig> is required for maintenance of the m <dig> mitotype. hence, either absence of lga <dig> or expression of rga <dig> in both mating partners confers biparental inheritance along with formation of recombinant mitotypes  <cit> . both lga <dig> and rga <dig> encode small basic proteins associated with mitochondria, however, their mode of action is elusive  <cit> . expression of lga <dig> is strongly upregulated in dikaryotic cells and remains highly expressed during biotrophic growth  <cit> . furthermore, conditional overepression of lga <dig> triggers mt fragmentation, selective loss of mt nucleic acids as well as mitophagy  <cit> . together, this suggested that in u. maydis upi resulted from selective degradation of mitochondria, and hence raised the question of whether mitophagy played an underlying role.

recently, we have demonstrated that u. maydis Δatg <dig> mutants are efficiently blocked in mitophagy in response to starvation as well as lga2-triggered mt damage. specifically, Δatg <dig> mutants maintained extensive mt fragmentation after lga <dig> overexpression, whereas accumulation of mitochondria-targeted egfp within vacuoles was abolished  <cit> . atg <dig>  initially characterized in yeast, is an adaptor protein specifically required for selective autophagy including mitophagy, but is dispensable for bulk autophagy  <cit> . for the present investigation, we analysed upi in dependence of atg <dig> in two strain combinations differing in their efficiencies of m <dig> mitotype elimination. our analysis provides evidence that mitophagy is not critical for upi in u. maydis.

RESULTS
pathogenic development of mating-compatible u. maydis Δatg <dig> mutants
in a previous study we have shown that u. maydis Δatg <dig> null mutants are blocked in mitophagy  <cit> . to assess a possible influence of mitophagy on upi, we generated mating-compatible Δatg <dig> null mutant strains differing in their mitotypes . the presence of mtgfp or mtrfp reporter constructs, allowing the detection of mt matrix-targeted green and red fluorescent protein, respectively, was irrelevant for this study, but previously served to assure the absence of mitophagy in fb <dig>  and fb <dig>  Δatg <dig> mutant strains under starvation conditions  <cit> . physical maps of the parental f and w types and the recombinant x <dig> type are depicted in figure  <dig>  the generated Δatg <dig> null mutant strains were verified by rflp  and pcr analyses as described  <cit>  . the u. maydis strains mf <dig> and gf <dig> both carry the w type, but differ in the a mating-type. since our previous investigation has shown that the m <dig> mitotype dominates over the m <dig> mitotype this provided for analysis of a possible influence of atg <dig> on upi in reciprocal combinations, in which either inheritance of the f type  or the w type  dominated. previously, combination i was shown to produce biparental inheritance to a minor extent  as judged from inheritance of the m <dig> mitotype as well as the recombinant x <dig> type to the sexual spore progeny, while mtdna inheritance in combination ii was apparently strictly uniparental based on rflp analysis  <cit> . for analysis of upi, we infected maize plants with combinations i and ii in the presence or absence of atg <dig>  this study revealed that Δatg <dig> mutants were neither affected in pathogenesis  nor in their ability to produce teliospores . the absence of significant differences in pathogenesis was corroborated by statistical analysis applying a non-parametric mann–whitney test . this revealed p-values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the / and / data sets, respectively, clearly exceeding the significance level of  <dig>  . hence, this allowed us to investigate a possible role of mitophagy in upi under comparable developmental conditions between wt and Δatg <dig> mutant strains.figure  <dig>

analysis of upi in strain combination i
for analysis of upi we firstly focused on strain combination i. for this purpose, total dna was extracted from germinated teliospores of mature tumour tissue for subsequent rflp as well as pcr analysis. explicitly, we analysed the sexual progeny  from several tumours whereby each tumour originated from a different plant either infected with the wt or Δatg <dig> mutant strain combination. rflp analysis revealed predominant inheritance of the m <dig> mitotype f as well as detection of the x <dig> type in a minor portion of samples as expected . a quantitative analysis of all signals obtained from rflp analyses is depicted in table  <dig>  pronounced inheritance of the w type was detected only in two tumour samples resulting from the Δatg <dig> combination . importantly, this analysis showed comparable rflp patterns and similar frequencies of m <dig> mitotype inheritance in the analysed spore progeny irrespective of the presence of atg <dig>  statistical mann–whitney test analysis between the two data sets for the wt and Δatg <dig> mutant strains revealed a p-value of  <dig>  for the f type dominance . in addition, the p-values for dominant  and minor  inheritance of the w and x <dig> types, which are indicative of biparental inheritance, were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. in conclusion, this rules out that the two data sets are significantly different.figure  <dig>

analysis of upi in strain combination ii
to assess a possible influence of mitophagy on strict upi the same experimental approach was applied to strain combination ii. to efficiently examine a large number of samples we developed a pcr test based on detection of the mitotype-specific introns lri <dig>  and lrii <dig>  . specifically, we used intron-specific primers to avoid competing pcrs in case of heteroplasmy. this approach enabled us to discriminate between upi  from biparental inheritance . for both the mutant and wt strain combination, we analysed 122– <dig> spores collected from 11– <dig> tumours each. mitotype analysis revealed exclusively strict m <dig> mitotype inheritance in all samples analysed irrespective of the presence of atg <dig> . only faint signals of the m <dig> mitotype f were additionally detected in samples of wt and mutant strains . as these signals were also associated with the corresponding parental strains used for plant infection these results imply their partial elimination in the spore progeny. hence, apparently pure homoplasmy was achieved in individual spores irrespective of the presence of atg <dig> . comparison of the data sets referring to leaky f type inheritance  between wt and mutant strains by mann–whitney test analysis revealed a p-value of  <dig> , thus ruling out significant differences. consistently, boxplot analysis revealed a similar median  between the Δatg <dig> mutant and the wt strain , but displayed an increased variance  of the data from the Δatg <dig> mutant  in favour of slightly enhanced biparental inheritance .figure  <dig>

next, we performed rflp analysis to corroborate the finding of atg11-independent strict upi, and furthermore compare the suitability of the selected methods towards detection of leaky biparental inheritance. we therefore included samples showing a faint f type signal as detected by pcr analysis . however, rflp analysis revealed exclusive inheritance of the w type, but did not allow detection of faint f type signals . hence, this rates the pcr approach more sensitive than the rflp approach for detecting residual m <dig> mitotype signals. consistent with strict upi, rflp analysis confirmed the absence of the recombinant x <dig> type in the sexual progeny .

quantitative determination of the m2/m <dig> ratios in the sexual progeny
to explicitly determine the efficiency of upi in strain combination ii, we performed a quantitative real-time pcr  analysis using dna from the spore progeny as well as from the parental m <dig> strains. furthermore, to rate the suitability of qpcr in terms of its sensitivity to detect leaky biparental inheritance, we used dna samples from spores that based on pcr analysis had revealed both the presence and absence of faint f type signals . primers were directed against the lrii <dig> or lri <dig> introns to determine the ratios of major m <dig> to minor m <dig> mitotype. firstly, this emphasized the strong dominance of w type inheritance in the spore progeny . in all samples analysed, the calculated / ratios were > <dig>  secondly, lowest ratios of / were associated with the parental strains as judged from analysing two independent dna preparations . as expected, / ratios were similarly pronounced for the parental control strains that displayed f type dominance , consistent with comparable efficiencies of the two primer combinations used. thirdly, occurrence of faint f type bands detected by pcr analysis was not reflected by qpcr analysis; i.e., / ratios of samples from an individual tumour, except for 4/ <dig>  were not significantly reduced despite the presence of a faint f type signal . this latter finding was surprising based on marked peak profiles calculated from image lanes displaying a faint f type signal . hence, this suggests that gel documentation of pcr products is most appropriate for detection of leaky biparental inheritance.

discussion
understanding the mechanisms of upi is of general importance since these might also account for the elimination of heteroplasmy as caused by accumulation of deleterious mtdna molecules  <cit> . in this study we have investigated a possible influence of mitophagy on upi in the smut fungus u. maydis. recent investigation has indicated a role of autophagy in maternal inheritance in c. elegans  <cit> . however, these studies did not address whether elimination of paternal mtdna specifically relied on mitophagy since lgg-1/ <dig> are generally required for autophagy, and furthermore, are essential for larval development  <cit> . based on ubiquitination as well as co-localization of sperm mitochondria with p <dig>  and the atg <dig> homolog lc <dig>  it was also speculated that autophagy is involved in maternal inheritance in mammals  <cit> . however, recent evidence does not support such a role of autophagy in mice. it rather appears that maternal inheritance of mtdna is mainly determined by elimination of sperm mtdna before fertilization as well as by uneven distribution of sperm mitochondria in embryos  <cit> .

to our knowledge, a role of mitophagy in upi has not yet been addressed in a microbial species. for the current investigation we used u. maydis Δatg <dig> mutants, which are blocked in mitophagy under starvation conditions as well as in response to conditional overexpression of lga <dig>  a situation that efficiently triggers mitophagy in u. maydis  <cit> . interestingly, this study has shown that Δatg <dig> mutants are not compromised in pathogenic development. hence, this contrasts from u. maydis Δatg <dig> mutants, which are severely attenuated in pathogenic development and hardly incite host tumours  <cit>  . consequently, u. maydis Δatg <dig> mutants did not provide for sexual spores required for analysis of upi. this finding suggests that bulk autophagy, but not selective autophagy is critical for u. maydis pathogenesis. importantly, the use of Δatg <dig> mutants allowed us to examine an influence of mitophagy on upi under comparable developmental conditions between mutant and wt strains, thus avoiding possible secondary effects.

for this study, we used two strain combinations that yielded upi with different efficiencies. in particular, combination i, including the w type strain mf <dig>  is somewhat prone to leaky m <dig> inheritance, thus giving rise to recombinant mitotypes in the sexual offspring, while this was not observed for the w type strain gf <dig>   <cit> . currently, the genetic determinants interfering with the efficiency of upi in u. maydis are elusive.

among the methods used for analysis of upi, gel documentation of pcr products has proven most consistent in the detection of faint amounts of the m <dig> mitotype. for combination i, pronounced m <dig> mitotype dominance along with minor occurrence of the recombinant x <dig> mitotype was very similar between the spore progeny of the wt and Δatg <dig> mutant strains . the exceptional marked inheritance  of the w type in individual tumour samples, as detected for the Δatg <dig> combination, has previously also been detected for the respective wt combination, although it rarely occurred . for combination ii, strict upi of the m <dig> mitotype was detected in all samples analysed. in particular, incidences of faint detection of the m1-associated intron were detected to similar extent between wt and mutant strain combinations, although slightly increased leakage of the m <dig> mitotype in the Δatg <dig> strain combination cannot entirely be excluded from the current data . taken together, these data revealed that, irrespective of the efficiency of upi, selective elimination of the m <dig> mitotype was largely unaffected in Δatg <dig> mutants. to explicitly quantify the efficiency of upi in the u. maydis strain combination ii, ratios of m2/m <dig> mitotypes in the sexual offspring were determined by qpcr. the values determined for the m2/m <dig> ratio were in the range of 107- <dig> for the majority of the analysed spore progeny  pointing out that the m <dig> mitotype was grossly eliminated in the sexual progeny. importantly, the same high ratios were detected for both wt and Δatg <dig> mutant strain combinations, further supporting that atg <dig> does not affect the efficiency of upi in u. maydis.

previously, we have shown that atg <dig> is required for lga2-triggered mitophagy  <cit> . the current finding of atg11-independent upi implies that lga2-induced upi and mitophagy are separate events. this conclusion is fully consistent with our previous observation that selective loss of mtdna precedes the onset of mitophagy in response to lga <dig> overexpression, suggesting that mitophagy is not the cause, but a secondary response of mtdna loss aimed to dispose of damaged mitochondria  <cit> . nonetheless, a role of mitophagy in upi of u. maydis cannot entirely be excluded. mitophagy could be involved in disposal of disintegrated mitochondria having maintained residual amounts of dna as well as their capacity of mt fusion  <cit> . in addition, it remains to be shown to what extent atg11-independent mitophagy operates by default during host infection. currently, there is no precedence for atg11-independent mitophagy reported in yeast  <cit> . for a number of systems, additional proteins mediating mitophagy have been identifed  <cit> . in yeast, this includes the atg32p protein, a mt outer membrane protein that functions as cargo receptor interacting with atg11p to mark mitochondria for mitophagy. furthermore, it has recently been shown that the mt fission factor dnm1p forms a complex with atg11p to promote mitophagy in yeast  <cit> . in light of the finding that in u. maydis, lga2-triggered mitophagy critically depends on dnm <dig>  <cit> , the possibility that dnm <dig> contributes to residual mitophagy in Δatg <dig> mutants requires further investigation. apart from selective mitophagy, non-selective macroautophagy or microautophagy-like mitochondria uptake are potential alternative mechanisms of mitochondria disposal  <cit> . hence, it will be rewarding to investigate mitophagy in the context of upi in u. maydis Δatg <dig> mutants to sort out the fate of disintegrated mitochondria.

evidence for post-fusion control of parental mtdna elimination has been provided for numerous microbial species and in a few cases, including the fungal species microbotryum violaceum, cryptococcus neoformans, ustilago maydis and phycomyces blakesleeanus, underlying control by the mating-type loci has been demonstrated  <cit> . confronted with a potential diversity of mechanisms underlying upi it might be worthwhile to widen the current investigation to further assess a role of mitophagy in establishing homoplasmy.

CONCLUSIONS
collectively, this study has shown that in u. maydis upi of mtdna does not require atg11-dependent mitophagy. the present work may be particularly useful in providing a framework for understanding mechanistic differences in the regulation of strict upi between isogamous and oogamous species.
