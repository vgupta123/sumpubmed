BACKGROUND
penicillium chrysogenum is widely used for industrial production of β-lactam antibiotics such as penicillins and cephalosporins. current production strains are the result of classical strain development programmes which, over a period spanning more than six decades, has improved productivity by several orders of magnitude  <cit> . throughout strain improvement, industrial and academic research has sought to understand the molecular basis and physiology of penicillin production by p. chrysogenum based on research in pure cultures.

the complete genome sequence of p. chrysogenum <cit>  revealed  <dig> putative polyketide synthase genes ,  <dig> non-ribosomal peptide synthase  genes and  <dig> genes encoding hybrid nrps-pks enzymes  <cit> . most of these genes are not significantly transcribed under standard laboratory conditions  <cit>  and, consequently, their functional and physiological roles remains to be determined.

the contribution of many secondary metabolites to evolutionary fitness of the producing organism remains unknown and subject to debate  <cit> . it is generally assumed that fungal penicillin biosynthesis has primarily evolved as a mechanism to combat competing bacteria. however, there is no evidence that fungal penicillin biosynthesis is triggered by the presence of bacteria. moreover, there is no a priori reason to assume that synthesis of fungal antibiotics it is single-layer defense mechanism. for example, nrps or pks gene clusters may enable the synthesis of compounds that complement and/or augment the action of penicillins.

several strategies have been successfully applied to activate and characterize cryptic gene clusters in filamentous fungi  <cit> . these methods include inactivation of biosynthesis genes  <cit> , heterologous expression  <cit>  and simulation of conditions that might activate gene clusters in natural environments  <cit> . a successful example the latter approach was achieved by co-culturing aspergillus nidulans with streptomyces hygroscopicus. genome wide expression analysis of a. nidulans revealed that co-cultivation led to specific expression of a polyketide gene cluster that was silent under standard conditions for laboratory growth of the fungus  <cit> . this example supports the notion that microbial interactions in natural environments may be a direct trigger for production of secondary metabolites and other means of ‘microbial warfare’. simulation of these interactions by co-cultivation in the laboratory is therefore a rational strategy to identify natural antimicrobial compounds and mechanisms. indeed, this approach has been successfully used to study interactions between microorganisms  <cit> , allowing the identification of a wide range of responses, ranging from increased production of stress-response related compounds  <cit> , induction of biofilm formation and modulation of virulence expression  <cit> . by providing in-depth knowledge on interaction mechanisms it provides an important tool for understanding the physiology of microorganisms, communication between microbial species and drug discovery  <cit> .

the dynamic nature of microbial interactions in mixed cultures limit the value of static  gene expression studies. time-course expression experiments, in which transcriptional responses to an external stimulus are recorded over time  <cit>  have been applied successfully to a wide range of perturbations  <cit> .

the original discovery of penicillin by fleming was unintentionally based on a co-cultivation experiment, involving interaction of a penicillium strain with bacteria on solid medium plates  <cit> . surprisingly however, interaction of this fungus with prokaryotes has subsequently not been studied in detail. the objective of the present study is to investigate the response of p. chrysogenum to co-cultivation with b. subtilis, a penicillin-sensitive gram-positive bacterium. to this end, steady-state chemostat cultures of p. chrysogenum wisconsin 54– <dig> were inoculated with b. subtilis. the dynamic transcriptional and physiological responses of p. chrysogenum in the resulting mixed cultures were monitored and analyzed. several differentially expressed genes potentially reflected responses to the bacterium. to test whether any bacterial signaling molecules are responsible for differential expression of selected fungal genes, p. chrysogenum cultures were supplemented with supernatant of b. subtilis cultures, supernatants from mixed cultures and with heat-inactivated b. subtilis. the specific transcriptional responses, identified using microarray, were verified by analysis of fermentation broth and by functional characterization of selected p. chrysogenum genes in s. cerevisiae.

RESULTS
co-cultivation of p. chrysogenum and b. subtilis and physiology
the interaction between p. chrysogenum and b. subtilis was studied in controlled chemostat experiments. p. chrysogenum strain wisconsin 54– <dig>  an early strain of the penicillin strain improvement lineage  <cit> , was grown in an aerobic, glucose-limited chemostat culture at a dilution rate of  <dig>  h- <dig>  this dilution rate is much lower than the maximum specific growth rates of p. chrysogenum and b. subtilis  in batch cultures on the synthetic medium used for the chemostat experiments. phenylacetate , which is needed for the efficient production of penicillin-g production by p. chrysogenum, was not included in growth media, to enable a focus on other, as yet unknown, antibacterial mechanisms in this fungus. when the p. chrysogenum chemostat cultures had reached stationary phase, they were inoculated with b. subtilis. although both organisms remained present during the entire 72 h of the co-cultivation experiment, the relative bacterial and fungal populations changed over time. during the mixed culture, b. subtilis grew faster than p. chrysogenum and, as a consequence, the b. subtilis biomass concentration increased by more than three fold while the p. chrysogenum biomass concentration was reduced by half over a 72 h period . comparison of p. chrysogenum biomass dynamics with a theoretical washout  at a dilution rate of  <dig>  h- <dig> confirmed that the fungal biomass was still growing, but slower than the dilution rate, leading to a declining population size in the reactor .

after the bacterial pulse, the characteristics of the fermentation changed. the chemostat was not in steady state anymore and the total biomass increased from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g l- <dig> to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g l- <dig> after 72 h of mixed culture. the specific oxygen uptake rate and the specific carbon dioxide production rate were decreased from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mmol g-1 h- <dig> and from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mmol g-1 h- <dig> respectively during 72 h of mixed culture .

at t = 0 h, a steady-state, glucose-limited chemostat culture of p. chrysogenum, grown in the absence of phenylacetate and at a dilution rate of  <dig>  h- <dig>  was inoculated with b. subtilis cultures. physiological parameters are presented as average and mean deviation of three independent replicate experiments.

atotal biomass is the sum of p. chrysogenum and b. subtilis biomass. bspecific rates of oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production  were calculated from biomass concentrations and manual analysis of the gas composition and gas-flow.

microscopic observation revealed no detectable adhesion of bacterial cells to the fungal hyphae and no morphological change in p. chrysogenum, but the morphology of b. subtilis changed dramatically during co-cultivation, from rod-shaped bacteria to spherical cells . to investigate whether the b. subtilis morphology change was caused by the presence of the fungus or the culture conditions, a control glucose-limited chemostat culture experiment under exactly the same conditions  but with a pure culture of b. subtilis was performed. as the culture was switched from batch to chemostat mode, the typical rod-shaped morphology b. subtilis changed into spherical cells. this indicated that the morphology change during co-cultivation with p. chrysogenum was due to the glucose-limited culture conditions rather than to a specific interaction with the fungus.

global transcriptional responses of p. chrysogenum to co-cultivation with b. subtilis
dynamic experiments are, inherently, richer in information than steady-state cultivation experiments but also more susceptible to experimental variation. tight control of experimental conditions and of data quality is therefore of paramount importance  <cit> . in view of their reproducibility, steady-state chemostat cultures are excellent experimental platforms for dynamic perturbation studies  <cit> . hence, to identify fungal genes whose expression would change in reaction to co-cultivation with b. subtilis, steady-state chemostat cultures of p. chrysogenum were inoculated with b. subtilis and followed over time . the variation among the same time points in independent duplicate chemostat experiments did not exceed 27%. analysis with the significance analysis of microarray  algorithm   <cit>  revealed no fewer than  <dig> p. chrysogenum genes whose expression changed during co-cultivation with b. subtilis. k-means clustering of these responsive genes yielded six clusters, with  <dig> genes displaying an ascending expression profile  and  <dig> genes exhibiting a descending profile  during co-cultivation . enrichment analyses using fischer’s exact statistical test did not reveal any enrichment of mips functional categories in clusters with descending profiles . in contrast, several functional categories were found to be overrepresented in all three clusters comprising ascending profiles  .

cluster  <dig> comprises fast-responding genes, which reached 80% of their maximum expression level within the first 24 h. this cluster showed overrepresentation of genes in the mips categories involved in primary metabolism, protein synthesis, folding and stabilization, energy conservation, electron transport, respiration and mitochondrial activity . for example, the gene with the highest fold change after 72 h of co-cultivation , pc12g <dig>  showed strong similarity to the alternative oxidase aox <dig> from aspergillus niger. cluster  <dig> contains genes that exhibited slower response profiles and showed an overrepresentation of genes involved in metabolism . in addition to genes with strong similarity to transporters , this category comprised genes with sequence homology to genes encoding carbohydrate cleaving enzymes such as mutanase, mannosidase and alpha-amylase, to a gene encoding a starvation sensing protein  and to a gene showing similarity to polyketide synthase pks <dig> from botryotinia fuckeliana . finally, cluster  <dig>  which comprises genes exhibiting a continuously increasing profile over the 72 h co-cultivation period, showed an overrepresentation of genes involved in cellular import . no fewer than five genes with similarity to the kluyveromyces lactis high-affinity glucose transporter gene hgt <dig>   and the glucose transporter rco- <dig> from neurospora crassa  were found in this cluster .

transcriptional responses of p. chrysogenum genes involved in secondary metabolite production to co-cultivation with b. subtilis
p. chrysogenum is primarily known for its ability to synthesize β-lactam antibiotics. closer inspection of the non-ribosomal peptide penicillin gene cluster   <cit>  and genes involved in side-chain precursor metabolism did not show differential expression during co-cultivation with b. subtilis <cit> . in addition to the penicillin biosynthesis gene cluster, the p. chrysogenum genome sequence  <cit>  harbors  <dig> other nrps and  <dig> nrps-like,  <dig> pks and  <dig> pks-like, and  <dig> hybrid nrps-pks gene clusters . all these genes potentially encode nrps and pks proteins enabling the synthesis of complex secondary metabolites  <cit>  . co-cultivation with b. subtilis had only small effects on expression of these nrp and pk gene clusters. only seven individual genes in these clusters were differentially expressed, of which only pc12g <dig> and pc16g <dig>  which share sequence similarity with the polyketide synthase pks <dig> from b. fuckeliana <cit>  and with the polyketide synthase pks <dig> from cochliobolus heterostrophus <cit> , respectively, were upregulated. however, their absolute expression levels remained very low .

b. subtilis induced mutanase production in p. chrysogenum
our data indicated that, in the absence of a penicillin side-chain precursor, other non-ribosomal peptides or polyketides did not replace penicillin as an antibiotic against b. subtilis in mixed cultures. among the top  <dig> of overexpressed p. chrysogenum genes, we focused our attention on two genes found in cluster  <dig>  these two genes, pc12g <dig> and pc12g <dig>  shared strong sequence similarity to the alpha- <dig> -glucanase muta from talaromyces. purpurogerus <cit>  and were upregulated by  <dig> fold and  <dig> fold, respectively after 72 h of co-cultivation with b. subtilis. occurrence of alpha- <dig>  3-glucanase  in response to the presence of b. subtilis represented a specific response of p. chrysogenum, as mutanase activity was not observed in pure cultures of either p. chrysogenum or b. subtilis. the presence of mutanase activity in culture supernatants was first observed after 24 h of mixed cultivation. this activity increased from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  u ml- <dig> at 24 h to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  u ml- <dig> at 72 h of co-cultivation even though, during this period, the p. chrysogenum biomass concentration decreased from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g l- <dig> at 24 h to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g l- <dig> at 72 h .

the upregulation of mutanase genes in p. chrysogenum could theoretically be induced by compounds released by b. subtilis. to test whether extracellular bacterial signaling molecules were sufficient to triggering fungal mutanase synthesis, 24 h-old p. chrysogenum shake-flask cultures cultures were aseptically supplied with either 30 ml of filter-sterilized supernatant of a pure b. subtilis culture, 30 ml of filter-sterilized supernatant a from mixed chemostat culture or with heat-inactivated b. subtilis cells. these cultures were allowed to grow for another 72 h and samples were taken after 0 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h for determination of mutanase activity . mutanase production was not observed when p. chrysogenum was co-cultured with b. subtilis supernatant or heat inactivated b. subtilis cells. however, the p. chrysogenum cultures did produce mutanase when inoculated with filter sterilized supernatants from 24-h mixed cultures of p. chrysogenum and b. subtilis. mutanase activity was also observed in control shake flask mixed culture of p. chrysogenum and b. subtilis . in any case the growth of p. chrysogenum was not inhibited by the b.subtilis culture fractions. in addition, mutan  was sufficient to induce mutanase production in p. chrysogenum supernatant. in contrast addition to the culture medium of pullulan , dextran  and β <dig>  glucan did not lead to mutanase induction .

cloning and functional characterization of two putative p. chrysogenum mutanase genes
to functionally characterize the two upregulated p. chrysogenum putative mutanase genes, the coding regions of pc12g <dig> and pc12g <dig> were expressed in s. cerevisiae, a eukaryotic microorganism that does not itself express mutanase. the predicted coding sequence of the putative mutanase pc12g <dig> included a 63-bp 5′ sequence predicted to encode an n-terminal signal peptide. therefore, pc12g <dig> cdna including the signal peptide was pcr amplified from mrna isolated from p. chrysogenum mycelium, pooled from different 72-h co-cultures with b. subtilis. the cdna was inserted in plasmid pag426gpd-ccdb  <cit> , which placed it under control of the constitutive tdh <dig> promoter and cyc <dig> terminator . when grown in shake-flask cultures on a synthetic medium containing 20 g l- <dig> glucose, s. cerevisiae strain ime <dig>  carrying this plasmid, showed a specific growth rate of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  h- <dig>  the sequence of the gene in the entry clone was confirmed by restriction analysis and dna sequencing. presence of the expression plasmid was confirmed by diagnostic pcr, and transcription of pc12g <dig> in s. cerevisiae ime <dig> confirmed by rt-qpcr . however, mutanase production was neither observed in cultures of this strain nor in cultures of a negative control strain .

the absence of mutanase activity in culture supernatants of s. cerevisiae ime <dig> might originate from a lack of recognition of the penicillium signal peptide by the yeast secretion machinery. to circumvent this potential problem, the first  <dig> nucleotides of pc12g <dig> were replaced by the signal peptide of the s.cerevisiae alpha mating factor  <cit> . the s. cerevisiae strain ime <dig>  expressing the α-factor pre-pro-peptide – p12g <dig> chimera, showed a strongly impaired specific growth rate  on glucose synthetic medium. a mutanase activity of  <dig>  u.ml- <dig> was detected in culture supernatants, confirming that pc12g <dig> encodes an active mutanase.

the amino acid sequence analysis of the second putative mutanase gene, pc12g <dig>  did not reveal the presence of a signal peptide. therefore, its cdna was directly cloned behind the α-factor pre-pro-peptide sequence to promote secretion of the enzyme by s. cerevisiae. in shake flask cultures of the resulting s. cerevisiae strain ime <dig> on glucose, it showed a specific growth rate of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  h- <dig>  no mutanase activity was detected in ime <dig> culture supernatant, despite confirmation by rt-pcr that the gene fusion was transcribed .

discussion
general responses of p. chrysogenum to co-cultivation with b. subtilis
while co-cultivation experiments under laboratory conditions cannot fully capture the entire complexity of microbial interactions in natural environment, they do enable identification of specific mechanisms by which micro-organisms interact  <cit> . the present study focused on responses of p. chrysogenum to co-cultivation with the b. subtilis. a substantial part of the transcriptional response of p. chrysogenum to co-cultivation could be attributed to competition for glucose, the growth-limiting nutrient used for the chemostat studies. however this has not been experimentally tested since our fermenters were not equipped with rapid sampling port and the actual supernatant sampling procedure was far too long to trust the measured values. when b. subtilis was inoculated in a glucose-limited chemostat of p. chrysogenum, the bacterium was able to grow faster than the fungus and, over a 72 h period, was well on the way to outcompete it highlighting a better affinity  of the bacterium for the limited nutrient. the strong up-regulation of p. chrysogenum genes including sugar transporters , including genes encoding putative high-affinity transporters, represents a typical response of a micro-organism that is confronted with competition for glucose as the growth-limiting nutrient  <cit> .

the gene pc12g <dig>  which showed the strongest upregulation during co-cultivation with b. subtilis, shares strong similarity with the alternative oxidase gene aox <dig> from a. niger. alternative oxidases in fungi and plants represent bypass energy coupling sites in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. their expression is upregulated under a variety of stress conditions, including changes in the supply of, or demand for, carbon, reducing power, and atp  <cit> . interestingly, alternative oxidases have also been directly implicated in the defense against microbes and, in the case of pathogens, with host cells. for example, expression of alternative oxidase in nicotania attenuata has been shown to contribute to resistance against pathogenic pseudomonas syringae <cit>  and, in pathogenic fungi, the enzyme counteracts the host’s immune system  <cit> .

the side-chain precursor phenylacetic acid, whose addition is essential for high-level production of penicillin g by p. chrysogenum, was not included in the growth media used for the present study. p. chrysogenum is able to synthesize phenylacetic acid by itself, using l-phenylalanine as a precursor  <cit> . however, co-cultivation did not affect expression of genes involved in phenylalanine production or catabolism. this result indicated that, at least in this strain background, co-cultivation of a penicillin-sensitive gram positive bacterium, did not trigger penicillin production. although the wisconsin strain of p. chrysogenum represents an early strain in the penicillin strain improvement lineage  <cit> , we cannot exclude the possibility that its penicillin biosynthetic pathways had already been deregulated as a result of strain improvement, thereby masking induction by the presence of bacterial cells. however, unexpectedly and in contrast to a previous study on co-cultivation of aspergillus nidulans with streptomyces hygroscopicus <cit> , p. chrysogenum did not induce other secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters upon in response to the presence of b. subtilis .

expression of fungal mutanase activity results from cross talk between p. chrysogenum and b. subtilis
although we were unable to connect co-cultivation of p. chrysogenum with a prokaryote to production of low-molecular weight fungal metabolites, co-cultivation clearly triggered the expression of two genes encoding putative α- <dig>   <dig> glucanases . synthesis of mutanase  is induced in several fungi and bacteria when mutan  or oligosaccharides such as raffinose are present in the growth medium  <cit> . mutanase production by trichoderma harzianum is triggered by sugars or molecule with α- <dig>  linkages, consistent with the ability of the enzyme to act on α- <dig>  linkages in bacterial biofilms and extracellular polysaccharides such as α-mutan  <cit> .

upregulation of the putative mutanase genes pc12g <dig> and pc12g <dig> required the presence of the two microorganisms simultaneously. supernatant of pure b. subtilis culture or heat inactivated b. subtilis cells were not sufficient to induce the expression of these genes , suggesting that the triggering molecule is  produced by b. subtilis in response to the presence of p. chrysogenum. induction of the mutanase genes during co-cultivation could, for example, result from the formation of α- <dig>  glucan containing exopolysaccharide by b. subtilis in response to co-cultivation by the fungus. this bacterial response could then be countered by the production of mutanase by the fungus. several pathogenic bacteria in environment reside in exopolysaccharide biofilm which protects bacterial cells from antibiotics  <cit> . if enzymes produced against these pathogenic bacterial exopolysaccharides in mixed culture enable bacterial biofilm degradation, this might potentiate fungal antibiotics by facilitating access to the bacteria.

p. chrysogenum pc12g <dig> is an atypical fungal mutanase without a mutan binding domain
of the two putative mutanase genes that were upregulated during co-cultivation, only pc12g <dig> yielded extracellular mutanase activity when expressed in saccharomyces cerevisiae. the genome sequence of p. chrysogenum <cit>  harbors six genes that share similarity to the muta genes from trichoderma harzianum and talaromyces purpurogerus  . comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences of these six putative mutanases revealed that only two of them  were predicted to contain a signal peptide. interestingly, the amino acid sequence analysis also revealed that, in contrast to previously characterized fungal mutanases, the pc12g <dig> amino acid sequence was much shorter and missed the c-terminal sequence that corresponds to the α-mutan binding domain .

pc12g <dig>  which showed a higher sequence similarity to t. purpurogenus muta, did not harbor an n terminal sequence corresponding to a signal peptide, but did contain a c-terminal extension corresponding to the mutan binding motif. of the six p. chrysogenum mutanases, not only pc12g <dig>  but also pc18g <dig> missed the α-mutan binding domain. however, in contrast to pc12g <dig>  pc18g <dig> did not appear to carry a signal peptide and was not expressed during co-cultivation with b. subtilis.

hitherto, fungal mutanases have been described as strictly extracellular enzymes  <cit> . interestingly, several of the genes with strong sequence similarity to mutanase genes in the p. chrysogenum genome appear to lack excretion signals.  <dig>  3-α-d-glucan has been detected in cell walls of aspergilllus wentii <cit>  and schizosaccharomyces pombe <cit> , intracellular mutanase-like enzymes may play a role in processing and/or degradation of fungal cell wall components. expression of the p. chrysogenum mutanase gene pc12g <dig> in s. cerevisiae  had a strong negative effect on yeast growth. this is an intriguing observation, since  <dig> -α-d-glucan has not been reported to occur in s. cerevisiae cell walls. detailed analysis of the mode of growth inhibition of mutanase-expressing strains may yield new insights in yeast cell wall composition and biosynthesis.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study demonstrates that co-cultivation experiments with defined mixed cultures provide a useful tool for identifying microbial interactions. under the experimental conditions, b. subtilis successfully competed with p. chrysogenum for the glucose, the growth-limiting nutrient. the fungus did not respond to this competition by induction of pathways for antimicrobial secondary metabolites. however, a co-cultivation-dependent expression of an extracellular fungal mutanase was observed, which was triggered by  extracellular compound produced by the mixed cultures but not by pure cultures of the two organisms. heterologous expression in s. cerevisiae revealed that of the p. chrysogenum genes induced during co-cultivation with b. subtilis encoded an extracellular mutanase that differed from previously described fungal mutanases due to the absence of an α-mutan binding domain.
