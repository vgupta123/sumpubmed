BACKGROUND
the habenula, which is a paired midline structure residing at the posterior and dorsal surface of the thalamus, is present in virtually all vertebrates. the habenula receives inputs from the forebrain limbic system and the basal ganglia through the stria medullaris and projects to the monoaminergic nuclei in the midbrain and hindbrain via the fasciculus retroflexus 
 <cit> . the neural connections of the habenula imply that it plays an important role in modulating emotion, motivation and reward values. indeed, dysfunction of the habenula has been implicated in psychiatric disorders, such as depression, schizophrenia and drug-induced psychosis
 <cit> . despite the importance of the habenula, relatively little is known about the molecular control of the specification and differentiation of this structure in vertebrates.

based on gene expression patterns and morphological landmarks, the caudal forebrain is divided into three segments, prosomeres  <dig>   <dig> and 3
 <cit> . the p <dig> and p <dig> domains generate the pretectum and prethalamus, respectively, while the alar plate of p <dig> produces the epithalamus and the thalamus. the epithalamus gives rise to the habenula, together with the pineal gland and choroid plexus. using genetic fate mapping, we have recently shown that thalamic neuron precursor cells express homeobox gene gbx <dig>  and the gbx <dig> lineage defines a sharp compartment boundary between the habenula and thalamus in the mouse embryo
 <cit> , demonstrating a clear segregation of habenular and thalamic neurons. in parallel, we have demonstrated that the segregation between p <dig> and p <dig> cells is regulated by the cell adhesion factor protocadherin 10b in zebrafish
 <cit> . however, how the epithalamus diverges from the thalamus and pretectum is largely unknown.

sonic hedgehog  is expressed in the ventral midline of the neural tube and functions as a morphogen to control the dorsoventral patterning of the entire central nervous system
 <cit> . uniquely, shh is expressed in a transverse band at the border between p <dig> and p <dig>  called the mid-diencephalic organizer  located at the prospective zona limitans intrathalamica 
 <cit> . therefore, the developing diencephalon receives shh signals from both dorsoventral and anteroposterior directions. experiments in chicks and zebrafish have demonstrated that shh is the key component of the mdo that controls development of the thalamus and the prethalamus in vertebrates
 <cit> . genetic studies in mice and fish have recently shown that shh signaling regulates the division of thalamic progenitor regions into rostral  and caudal thalamic  domains
 <cit> . enhancing shh activity shifts the border between rth and cth caudally, whereas decreasing shh signaling shifts the border anteriorly
 <cit> . interestingly, cells in the caudal area of the thalamus seem refractory to alterations of shh activity
 <cit> , and the effect of changed shh function on epithalamic development has not been characterized in detail in the previous studies.

pax <dig>  which encodes a transcription factor containing a paired domain and a homeodomain, is broadly expressed in the developing forebrain of vertebrates
 <cit> . in the absence of pax <dig>  although the regionalization of the diencephalon is initially preserved, formation of the prosomere boundary and axonal projections from the thalamus are severely disrupted in mice
 <cit> . the formation of the epithalamus has never been characterized in pax6-deficient vertebrates. however, it has been reported that the pineal gland is missing or greatly reduced in people lacking a functional copy of pax <dig> <cit> , suggesting that pax <dig> protein may play a crucial role in the development of the epithalamus including the habenula. interestingly, shh expression and perhaps its activity are enhanced at the mdo of pax6-deficient mouse embryos at embryonic day   <dig> )
 <cit> . antagonistic interactions between pax <dig> and shh are known to play a crucial role in patterning the spinal cord and the telencephalon
 <cit> . however, it remains to be explored how pax6-shh interaction regulates the development of the mid-diencephalon, particularly the habenula.

the goal of this study is to investigate the molecular control of habenula development. to this end, we first analyzed the expression patterns of molecules that define different populations of habenular cells. using these newly discovered habenular markers, we examined the genetic interactions between pax <dig> and shh in the control of habenular development. we demonstrate that pax <dig> regulates the temporospatial expression of shh at the mdo. furthermore, shh signaling plays a crucial role in regulating the specification of the habenula. our results provide novel information on the development of the habenula and the mdo.

RESULTS
characterization of progenitors and precursors of habenular neurons
to investigate the developmental program that controls the subdivision of p <dig> into the epithalamus and the thalamus, we began by looking for molecular markers that define the epithalamus, particularly the habenula, in mouse embryos. we performed a detailed analysis of a variety of known developmental regulators that are differentially expressed in the diencephalon at e <dig> , a stage when most habenular and thalamic neurons are being generated. as described previously
 <cit> , proneuronal gene neurog <dig>  is broadly expressed in progenitors located in the thalamic ventricular zone  and also basal progenitors in the cth . neurog <dig> transcripts are also present in the vz dorsal to the cth, suggesting that neurog <dig> is also expressed in epithalamic progenitors . irx <dig>  which encodes a protein belonging to the iroquois homeodomain family, is expressed in the dorsal side of the diencephalon
 <cit> . at e <dig> , transcripts of irx <dig>  as well as those of paralogous genes irx <dig> and irx <dig>  are abundantly present throughout the epithalamus, pretectum and prethalamus, while a lower level of expression is seen in the vz of the cth . homeobox gene dbx <dig> is initially expressed in p <dig> in a dorsalhigh-ventrallow gradient
 <cit> . by e <dig> , dbx <dig> transcripts are mainly restricted to the vz of the presumptive epithalamus and are barely detectable in the cth . in addition to its strong expression in the prethalamus, a weaker expression domain of wnt7b is present in the vz of the epithalamus overlapping with that of dbx <dig> . collectively, our data suggest that the habenular progenitor domain is marked by the combinatorial expression of neurog <dig>  irx <dig>  dbx <dig> and wnt7b.

we next analyzed genes that mark postmitotic habenular neurons. as described previously, pou4f <dig>  is specifically expressed in the habenula
 <cit>  . axonal guidance genes robo <dig> and neuropilin  <dig>  are expressed in the habenula
 <cit> . transcripts of robo <dig> and nrp <dig> were detected in cells that emerged from the habenular progenitor domain marked by dbx <dig> and wnt7b . etv <dig>  which encodes a member of the ets family of transcription factors, is expressed in the prospective habenula at e <dig> 
 <cit> . at e <dig> , etv <dig> transcripts were detected in cells residing between the lateral-most area that was positive for pou4f <dig>  robo <dig> and nrp <dig> and the dbx1+/wnt7b+ vz . although it has been suggested that bhlhe <dig>  is expressed in the area caudal and dorsal to the thalamus including the epithalamus
 <cit> , bhlhe <dig> transcripts were mainly found in the lateral wall of the pretectum residing in an area dorsal and caudal to the pou4f1+ domain . furthermore, the bhlhe23+ domain was positioned parallel but more lateral to the expression domain of pax <dig>  which demarcates the pretectal vz 
 <cit> .

to forge the link between the gene expression pattern in the embryo and the mature habenular nuclei after birth, we performed genetic fate mapping to examine the developmental fate of etv1-expressing cells in the mouse embryo. we crossed the etv1creer knock-in mouse strain  and a cre-reporter line, r26rrfp, in which robust red fluorescence protein  will be permanently expressed upon cre-mediated excision of a stop cassette flanked by two loxp sequences upstream of a cdna encoding tdtomato rfp
 <cit> . no rfp-labeled cells were detected in etv1creer/+; r26rrfp/+ embryos that did not receive tamoxifen , demonstrating that creer-mediated recombination is dependent on tamoxifen administration. to label etv1-expressing cells, we administered tamoxifen to time-pregnant females carrying etv1creer/+; r26rrfp/+ embryos, and examined the distribution of rfp-labeled cells at postnatal day   <dig> and  <dig>  in the caudal forebrain, descendants of etv1-expressing cells labeled at e <dig>  were mostly found in the medial habenular nuclei, which were delineated by pou4f <dig> immunoreactivity, in etv1creer/+; r26rrfp mice at p <dig> and p <dig> . therefore, the etv <dig> expression domain in the diencephalon at e <dig>  identifies precursors of the medial habenular nuclei.

in summary, we have identified several molecular markers that are expressed in distinct but overlapping domains of the prospective habenula at e <dig>  .

loss of pax <dig> results in expansion of the pretectum and thalamus at the expense of the epithalamus
to investigate if pax <dig> is essential for habenular development, we characterized the diencephalic phenotype in mouse embryos homozygous for a spontaneous small eye  mutation, which is a null mutation in the pax <dig> gene
 <cit> . the transcripts of dbx <dig> and wnt7b were completely missing in p <dig> of pax6sey/sey embryos at e <dig>  . furthermore, neurog <dig> expression in the presumptive habenular progenitor domain was also absent . in concurrence with the abnormal specification of the habenular progenitor domain, transcripts of irx <dig>  pou4f <dig>  nrp <dig> and etv <dig> were mostly absent in the prospective habenular precursors of pax6sey/sey embryos at e <dig>  . these observations indicate that loss of pax <dig> disrupts the specification and differentiation of the habenula.

we next examined how loss of pax <dig> altered the patterning of the diencephalon, particularly the formation of the thalamus and the pretectum, as they reside in the ventral and caudal sides of the habenula, respectively. olig <dig> is normally expressed in the thalamus  and the zli
 <cit>  . in pax6sey/sey embryos at e <dig> , olig <dig> expression was maintained and its expression domain appeared expanded dorsally . because of the flexure of the neural tube, the pretectum, which is demarcated by the expression of pax <dig> and ascl <dig>  appeared dorsal to the epithalamus on a coronal section . immunofluorescence for dbx <dig> and pax <dig> showed that these two molecules are expressed in two juxtaposed domains, corresponding to the habenula and the pretectum, respectively, at e <dig>  . in pax6sey/sey embryos, the expression domains of pax <dig> and ascl <dig> were expanded anteriorly/ventrally so that the ascl <dig> and pax <dig> expression domain abnormally opposed or partially overlapped with that of the olig3+ domain at e <dig>  . remarkably, probably because of the protein perdurance, dbx <dig> protein was still detectable in the presumptive habenula of pax6sey/sey embryos despite the lack of dbx <dig> transcripts by e <dig>  . however, many of these dbx1+ cells abnormally expressed pax <dig> . this suggests that some habenular progenitors may be initially formed but adopt a pretectal fate in the absence of pax <dig>  collectively, our data suggest that the thalamic and pretectal progenitor domains are respectively expanded dorsally and anteriorly at the expense of the epithalamus in the absence of pax <dig> 

to confirm the abnormal expansion of thalamic and pretectal domains in pax6sey/sey embryos, we analyzed markers for thalamic and pretectal neurons. homeobox gene gbx <dig> is broadly expressed in postmitotic thalamic neurons and the gbx2-lineage exclusively contributes to cth-derived nuclei
 <cit> . taking advantage of enhanced green fluorescence protein  expression from the gbx2creer locus, which contains a creer-ires-egfp cassette in the 5′-untranslated region  of the gbx <dig> gene
 <cit> , we examined the distribution of thalamic neurons in pax6sey/sey embryos at e <dig> . double labeling of gfp and neurofilament  showed that the posterior border of the gfp+ thalamus was marked by the nf+ fr tract, which is formed by the habenular efferents
 <cit>  . pretectal neurons are mostly gamma-aminobutyric acid ergic and extend axonal fibers to the dorsal midline forming the posterior commissure . in pax6sey/sey embryos at e <dig> , gfp+ cells encroached the presumptive habenula and were intermingled with gaba+ neurons . the fr tract was replaced by defasciculating axonal fibers running from the gfp+ domain to the ventral midbrain . interestingly, these axonal fibers were mostly positive for gaba, resembling posterior commissural axons rather than the fr tract . collectively, these data suggest that thalamic and pretectal neurons occupy the presumptive habenula in pax6sey/sey mutants.

in summary, our findings demonstrate that pax <dig> is essential for the development of the habenula. in the absence of pax <dig>  the habenula is lost in association with the dorsal expansion of the thalamus and anterior expansion of the pretectum.

pax <dig> is required for the establishment of the anlage of the mdo
we next investigated if pax <dig> has a conserved function within the vertebrate lineage. therefore, we analyzed pax <dig> function during mid-diencephalic development in zebrafish. first, we analyzed the expression pattern of a prethalamic marker, dlx2a, and pretectal marker, prox <dig> <cit> . we found that both expression domains expand towards the mdo/thalamus anlage and simultaneously the mdo/thalamus primordia shrink in embryos overexpressed with pax <dig> mrna . to block pax <dig> function in zebrafish, we performed a morpholino oligomer-based double knock-down approach for both pax <dig> homologs, pax6a and pax6b, which are expressed early in the diencephalon of zebrafish embryos
 <cit> . consistently, knock-down of pax <dig> leads to a broadening of the mdo/thalamus anlage  and in a few cases the pretectal expression of prox <dig> becomes down-regulated . next, we addressed the expression of otx <dig>  a marker of the primordium of the mdo/thalamus, and irx1b, which is expressed in the thalamus . we found that irx1b shifts anteriorly into the territory of the mdo anlage in embryos in which pax <dig> mrna is overexpressed , suggesting that pax <dig> represses the mdo primordium. consistently, knock-down of pax <dig> function leads to a broadening of the mdo primordium, whereas the thalamus seems to be less affected . this suggests that pax <dig> restricts the anteroposterior width of the mdo primordium in zebrafish.

pax <dig> is essential for regulating the expression of shh in the prospective mdo
pax <dig> is broadly expressed in the diencephalon before e <dig>  and maintained in the habenula and prethalamus at e <dig> 
 <cit> . previous studies have shown that loss of pax <dig> leads to expanded expression of shh in the mdo
 <cit> , suggesting that pax <dig> plays an important role in regulating the mdo shh expression. we confirmed that the shh expression domain in the mdo was indeed expanded in pax6sey/sey embryos at e <dig>  . furthermore, the expression domain of ptch <dig>  which is considered as a readout gene of shh activity
 <cit> , was also expanded in both the thalamus and prethalamus in pax6sey/sey embryos at e <dig>  , demonstrating enhanced shh signaling in the diencephalon lacking pax <dig>  it has been shown that activating shh by forced expression of a constitutively active shh receptor smoothened  throughout the neural tube causes expansion of the rth at the expense of the cth
 <cit> . in accordance with these findings, we found that the zli and the rth, which are demarcated by the adjacent ascl1–/neurog2+ and ascl1+/neurog2– domains, respectively
 <cit> , were noticeably enlarged in pax6sey/sey embryos at e <dig>  . altogether, these results demonstrate that the loss of pax <dig> results in an expanded shh expression domain and enhanced shh activity at the zli.

we next investigated whether pax <dig> was required for the establishment of shh expression in the zli. shh is broadly expressed in the basal plate of the future diencephalon as early as e <dig> 
 <cit> . a wedge-shaped shh+ domain corresponding to the prospective zli was detected in wildtype embryos at e <dig>  but not at e <dig>  . by contrast, the mdo shh expression domain was clearly visible in pax6sey/sey embryos by e <dig>  , demonstrating that the loss of pax <dig> results in precocious induction of mdo shh expression in mice.

loss of shh activity leads to expansion of the epithalamus at the expense of the thalamus at e <dig> 
to investigate whether the loss of the habenula could be attributed to altered shh function in pax6sey/sey embryos, we first sought to determine if shh is essential for habenular development. there is decreased cell proliferation and increased cell death in the entire diencephalon in mouse embryos homozygous for a shh-null mutation at e <dig> 
 <cit> . to investigate the patterning role of shh without the complication of growth defects in the diencephalon lacking shh before e <dig> , we performed analyses in mice homozygous for a shh knock-in allele , which produces shh::gfp fusion protein with reduced shh activity
 <cit> . in shhsg/sg embryos at e <dig> , although shh expression was unchanged in the basal plate and zli, the expression domain of ptch <dig> was noticeably reduced in the thalamus at e <dig>  , indicating attenuated shh activity in the p <dig> area in shhsg/sg embryos. remarkably, the expression domain of dbx <dig> and wnt7b in the presumptive epithalamus was expanded ventrally and overlapped with that of neurog <dig> and olig <dig> at e <dig>  . at e <dig> , the expression domain of irx <dig>  pou4f <dig>  nrp <dig> and etv <dig> was noticeably enlarged at the expense of the thalamus in shhsg/sg embryos . immunofluorescence for gfp and nf in gbx2creer/+; shhsg/sg embryos at e <dig>  revealed that the gfp+ thalamus was evidently reduced in size compared with that of the control . furthermore, the habenula was expanded ventrally, and noticeably enlarged and multiple fr tracts were often detected in shhsg/sg embryos . our results demonstrate that shh plays an important role in positioning the border between the epithalamus and the thalamus. reducing shh activity leads to enlargement of the habenula at the expense of the thalamus.

reducing shh signaling partially restores the formation of the habenula in pax6sey/sey embryos
to define the epistatic relationship between shh and pax <dig> in regulating habenular development, we investigated whether reducing shh activity could rescue the habenula in embryos lacking pax <dig> by generating pax6sey/sey; shhsg/sg double mutant embryos. similar to that found in pax6sey/sey embryos, the mdo shh expression domain was expanded in pax6sey/sey; shhsg/sg double mutant embryos at e <dig>  . however, the range and the level of ptch <dig> expression in the thalamus in pax6sey/sey; shhsg/sg embryos were more similar to those found in wildtype than those in either pax6sey/sey or shhsg/sg single mutant embryos at e <dig>  . these observations suggest that attenuated shh protein activity may partially offset an increased shh transcription at the mdo leading to relatively normal shh signaling in the diencephalon in pax6sey/sey; shhsg/sg embryos. significantly, the expression domain of irx <dig>  pouf <dig> and nrp <dig> was largely restored in the presumptive habenular region in pax6sey/sey; shhsg/sg double mutant embryos at e <dig>  . these results indicate that shh acts downstream of pax <dig> in controlling the formation of the habenula. despite the rescue of some habenular markers, etv <dig> expression and the fr tract were still absent in pax6sey/sey; shhsg/sg embryos at e <dig>  . therefore, in addition to its important role in restricting shh, pax <dig> may have an additional role in directly regulating habenular formation.

pax <dig> limits shh expression in the mdo independent of irx1b function in zebrafish
next, we investigated the role of pax <dig> in the regulation of the mdo shh expression in zebrafish. overexpression of pax <dig> led to a strong decrease of shh expression in the mdo in zebrafish , consistent with the loss of otx <dig> in the mdo primordium . similar to the loss of pax <dig> in mice, blockage of the function of both zebrafish homologues pax6a and pax6b by morpholino oligomers led to an expansion of the mdo shh expression domain ; however, a precocious formation of the shh positive organizer was not observed in fish . co-injection of human pax <dig> mrna restored the mdo shh expression in pax <dig> double morphant zebrafish embryos , demonstrating the specificity of the knock-down. in fish and mice, it has been shown that irx <dig> controls the posterior limit of the mdo shh expression domain
 <cit> . we found that overexpression of pax <dig> led to an anterior shift of irx1b expression into the primordium of the mdo . therefore, we asked whether the down-regulation of shh expression in pax6-overexpressing embryos is mediated by irx1b or directly controlled by pax <dig>  depletion of the irx1b function in zebrafish results in expanded shh expression in the mdo, similar to that found in pax <dig> double morphant embryos . to determine the epistatic relationship between pax <dig> and irx1b in regulating shh expression, we injected pax <dig> mrna in irx1b-mo embryos and found that the mdo shh expression domain was greatly reduced, similar to that found in pax6-overexpressing embryos . these data show that pax <dig> acts downstream or in parallel with irx1b in restricting the mdo shh expression in fish.

collectively, our results demonstrate that pax <dig> plays an evolutionarily conserved function in establishing the temporal and spatial expression domain of shh in the prospective mdo organizer.

shh function from the mdo influences habenula formation
in the next set of experiments, we investigated if pax <dig> and shh regulate the formation of the epithalamus in zebrafish in a way similar to that found in the mouse embryo. we used otx <dig> as an early marker for the pineal gland, a key derivative of the epithalamus
 <cit>  and cxcr4b as a marker for habenula precursors
 <cit> . we found that double knock-down of pax6a/pax6b led to a reduced expression of otx <dig>  and cxcr4b . conversely, overexpression of pax <dig> mrna led to an increase in the expression domain of otx <dig>  and cxcr4b . this indicates that pax <dig> positively regulates the size of the epithalamus in fish similar to that found in mouse embryos. we reasoned that the influence of pax <dig> on epithalamus development could be mediated by shh signaling from the mdo as found in the mouse embryo. therefore, we analyzed epithalamus formation in embryos carrying a mutation in the shh co-receptor smoothened 
 <cit> . we found an increase in the epithalamic expression of otx <dig> in smub641/b <dig> mutants . next, we blocked pax <dig> function in the smub641/b <dig> mutant background and found that in the absence of shh signaling pax <dig> knock-down does not alter the size of the epithalamic otx <dig> expression  and cxcr4b expression domain  compared to smub641/b <dig> mutant embryos . similarly, we found that overexpression of pax <dig> in smub641/b <dig> did not change the epithalamus phenotype  compared to smub641/b <dig> mutant fish. this suggests that pax <dig> influences the development of the epithalamus - here the pineal complex and habenula - via regulation of shh signaling at the zli organizer in the mid-diencephalon.

discussion
there is a surge of interest in the habenula because of its important role in cognitive and emotive behaviors
 <cit> . however, the molecular underpinnings of the development of the habenula in vertebrates are still poorly understood. expression profiling of postmitotic habenular neurons has recently demonstrated that the habenula represents a unique molecular territory in the central nervous system and is composed of heterogeneous cell types
 <cit> . as a first step in understanding the specification and differentiation of habenular neurons, we have characterized the molecular markers that define habenular progenitors and precursors. using genetic fate mapping, we have established a definite link between the medial habenular nuclei and etv1-expressing progenitors in the epithalamus.

transplantation and genetic manipulation experiments have demonstrated that shh is the key molecule for mdo activity
 <cit> . experiments in the zebrafish have suggested that transcription factors, such otx1/otx <dig>  fezf <dig> and irx1b, form an interactive network to define the competent domain for the induction of shh in the prospective mdo
 <cit> . this model, however, is not completely compatible with expression data and loss-of-function studies in mice
 <cit> . the molecular mechanism underlying the formation of the mdo shh expression in mammals remains to be determined. we found that loss of pax <dig> causes not only expanded shh expression, but also precocious formation of the wedge-shaped shh expressing domain in the prospective zli in mouse embryos by e <dig> , at least  <dig> hours before the expression normally commences. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of accelerated formation of the mdo shh expression domain caused by a mutation in vertebrates. it has been shown that shh function in the ventral region is not essential for the induction of the mdo shh expression
 <cit> . in line with these conclusions, we found that the mdo shh expression domain was similarly expanded in pax6sey/sey and pax6sey/sey; shhsg/sg double mutants. these findings demonstrate that the temporospatial expression of shh in the prospective zli is independent of shh signals from the basal plate, but directly regulated by pax <dig>  gain-of-function of pax <dig> results in reduced expression of the mdo shh expression in fish  and chick embryos as described recently
 <cit> . therefore, pax <dig> plays an evolutionarily conserved function in the establishment of the mdo shh expression.

in thalamic explants, different concentrations of shh proteins induced differential expression of rth- and cth-specific markers, suggesting that shh acts as a morphogen to pattern p2
 <cit> . indeed, increasing or reducing shh activity alters the position of the border between rth and cth in relation to the zli
 <cit> . although the formation of the habenula was not explicitly characterized, altered expression of dbx <dig> and olig <dig>  indicative of abnormal p <dig> subdivision, was reported in mouse embryos with excess or reduction of shh activity
 <cit> . by analyzing mouse embryos homozygous for sey or a shh-hypomorphic mutation and smub641/b <dig> mutant embryos or fish embryos knocked-down for pax <dig> function, we showed that shh plays a crucial role in positioning the border between the epithalamus and cth, demonstrating that shh has a long-range effect in the development of the entire p <dig>  the far-reaching activity of shh may be achieved by the combined action of shh signals emanated from both the basal plate and the zli cells . future studies are required to determine if shh signaling positions the border between the cth and the habenula by directly inhibiting habenula fate or indirectly via promoting the cth identity.

antagonizing interactions between pax <dig> and shh play an important role in dorsoventral patterning of the neural tube. in the spinal cord, loss of pax <dig> leads to expansion of the shh expression domain in floor plate
 <cit> . furthermore, pax <dig> regulates the competence of the tissue in response to shh signals
 <cit> . similarly, removal of pax <dig> partially rescues the medial ganglionic eminence marker in the forebrain of shh mutants
 <cit> . in the current study, we demonstrate a similar antagonistic interaction between pax <dig> and shh in patterning the p <dig> alar plate. in the absence of pax <dig>  the development of habenula was blocked, while markers of the thalamus and pretectum were ectopically expressed in the presumptive habenula . similarly, it has been shown that the expression domain of thalamic markers, vmat <dig> and ptn , is shifted dorsally to the epithalamus in pax6sey/sey embryos
 <cit> . conversely, the expression of habenular markers was expanded into the thalamus in mouse and fish embryos with reduced shh function or gain of function of pax <dig> . in addition, we observed partial co-expression of pretectal and caudal thalamic markers if pax <dig> is inactivated, which suggests that pax <dig> may also be involved in demarcating the cth/pretectum boundary. importantly, attenuation of shh partially rescued expression of habenular markers in the presumptive epithalamus in pax6sey/sey embryos . furthermore, genetic experiments in zebrafish clearly demonstrated that shh acts downstream of pax <dig> in controlling the formation of the pineal complex and habenular precursors . collectively, our findings demonstrate that patterning defects in the p <dig> domain that is devoid of pax <dig> can, in part, be attributed to the precocious formation of mdo shh expression and/or enhanced shh activity in both mouse and fish embryos. it is worth noting that despite the rescue of some habenular markers, etv <dig> expression was missing and the fr tract was also absent in pax6sey/sey; shhsg/sg embryos at e <dig>  . it has been shown that etv <dig> is a direct transcriptional target of pax <dig> in cortical development
 <cit> . furthermore, we found that deletion of etv <dig> resulted in abnormal formation of the medial habenular nuclei in mice . therefore, in addition to its regulation of shh, pax <dig> may also have a direct role in regulating the differentiation of the habenula.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have combined gene expression and genetic fate-mapping to define the progenitors of habenular nuclei. we demonstrate that pax <dig> is essential for establishing the temporospatial expression of shh in the prospective zli in vertebrates. furthermore, we demonstrate that shh has a far-reaching effect in mediating pax <dig> function in controlling the p <dig> domain to diverge into the epithalamus, cth, and rth.
