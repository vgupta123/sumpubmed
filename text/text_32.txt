BACKGROUND
mycobacterium abscessus  is an emerging human pathogen, responsible for a majority of pulmonary infections caused by rapidly growing mycobacteria  in the united states, with a much higher fatality rate than any other rgm  <cit> . mab lung infections usually, but not exclusively, develop in subjects with underlying lung disorders including cystic fibrosis   <cit> . in patients with cf, mab causes a serious, life-threatening lung disease with disseminated, often fatal infections following lung transplantation  <cit> . mab is also amongst the most antibiotic-resistant rgm species, with a diverse chromosomally-encoded resistome, and infection often requires prolonged treatment  <cit> .

phenotypically, mab manifests as either a smooth  or a rough  colony morphotype. the transition from mab-s to mab-r is associated with the loss of glycopeptidolipids  in the outermost layer of the cell envelope. gpls confer several surface phenotypes, such as aggregation, sliding motility and biofilm formation  <cit>  and, depending on structural modifications, may be important immunomodulators  or inert molecules  <cit> . mab-s is reported to retain the ability to form biofilms and to colonize surfaces but is unable to cause persistent infections, while mab-r does not form biofilms but invades and multiplies within macrophages, causing persistent infections  <cit> . the primary objective of this work is to facilitate a greater understanding of the early transcriptional events associated with the host macrophage response to infection with mab. in addition, we hoped to identify indicative differences in the early host transcriptional responses to the mab-s or mab-r variants, to gain insights into their potential contribution towards the progress of infection.

RESULTS
library generation and clustering
thp-1-derived macrophages were infected in parallel with smooth and rough variants of m. abscessus atcc 19977-ip  <cit> . samples were collected at  <dig>   <dig> and 24 h post-infection , with the objective of capturing the initial interaction of host and pathogen, the early response of the host and a slightly later response following the establishment of infection. the number of bacteria  and macrophage viability were assessed at each time point post infection. no significant differences were observed in mab cfu, and the percentages of dead macrophages were comparable for both strains .

rna sequencing  of poly-a selected messenger rna  and small rna-seq  of size-selected micro-rna  transcripts from infected cells and uninfected controls were performed at  <dig>   <dig> and 24 hpi. on average,  <dig>  and  <dig>  million reads from the rna-seq and srna-seq libraries, respectively, were uniquely mapped to the human genome . in total,  <dig>  mrnas and  <dig> mature mirnas could be detected in at least one experimental condition . unsupervised hierarchical clustering showed that samples from infected macrophages grouped distinctly from uninfected controls at each time point . additionally, infected samples from the  <dig> and 24 hpi time points clustered separately from all 1 hpi samples, indicating clear temporal alterations in gene expression driven by the infection process. multidimensional scaling  analysis  also clearly illustrates the separate clustering of infected and uninfected samples, and their segregation according to time point.fig.  <dig> library clustering and overlap of de genes. a unsupervised hierarchical clustering of mrna libraries based on the normalised expression levels of the  <dig> most variable genes. libraries from mab-r- and mab-s-infected cells group separately from uninfected cells, with the  <dig> and 24 hpi infection libraries forming a discrete cluster from all 1 hpi libraries. b venn diagrams illustrating the overlap of de genes identified for mrna and mirna libraries at  <dig> and 24 hpi. the numbers of de genes were found to increase progressively during infection in both cases. mab-s elicited a more robust response, with mab-r inducing comparatively fewer unique de genes



differential gene expression
to investigate the differential expression of mrna transcripts upon infection with either mab-s or mab-r, a generalized linear model  was implemented using edger  <cit> , allowing the comparison of controls and infected samples at each time point. genes with at least a 2-fold change in abundance and with a p-value of below  <dig> , with multiple testing correction according to the benjamini-hochberg approach, were regarded as differentially expressed . at  <dig>   <dig> and 24 hpi, we identified  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> de genes, respectively, between mab-r-infected cells and uninfected controls . when comparing mab-s-infected cells to uninfected controls,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> such genes were identified, respectively . overall, these figures indicate that the number of de genes increased progressively during infection, likely reflecting an early re-programming of the host cellular machinery, followed by a more robust transcriptional response upon the adaptation of the bacilli to their host.

temporal expression models identify a core response to mab infection
given the significant overlap of de genes between mab-s and mab-r infected cells , we sought to identify genes with highly similar response profiles. the short time series expression miner   <cit>  was used to define temporal profiles for all de genes . profiles with a significant level of overlap between mab-s- and mab-r-infected cells , comprising a total of  <dig> genes, were considered to comprise the core response.fig.  <dig> clustering of core response genes and enriched go terms. a temporal model profiles of de genes identified using stem and ordered by p values indicating the significance of enrichment. profiles shown in color contain a significant over-representation of genes, and the overlap of these profiles comprises the core response. b connectivity among enriched go terms. edge size indicates the level of overlap of genes shared between the enriched go terms, and node size indicates the level of enrichment of the go term



go term enrichment of core response genes indicated a prominent role for the type-i interferon and cytokine-mediated signaling pathways in the host response to both morphotypes . further analysis using cluego  <cit>  demonstrated that many of the enriched go terms share core response genes in common, and are thus highly interconnected .table  <dig> go terms enriched among core response genes. the five most significantly over-represented biological processes identified through go enrichment analysis of core response genes



m. tuberculosis  infection of macrophages induces an ifn response, and the transcriptional signature of thp- <dig> cells exposed to different mtb strains has been described  <cit> . in both cases, a large majority of core response genes were found to be upregulated, rather than repressed, upon infection. seventy three of the core response genes to mab were also identified as part of the core response to mtb , representing a highly significant overlap  and suggesting a conserved role for type-i ifn responses across diverse mycobacterial species. eighty-two percent of genes overlapping the two datasets were upregulated in both cases, including all ifn-inducible and cytokine-related genes. just a single gene  was identified as repressed in both datasets.

the co-expression of genes within the mab core response suggests that some of these genes may also be co-regulated. to identify possible upstream regulators of the response, we searched for transcription factor binding sites  with enrichment proximal to core response genes using the cisred database  <cit> . four tfbss were identified as having significant enrichment, each of which has a known role in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. these included the interferon regulatory factor  <dig> , a key mediator of the type-i ifn response pathway  <cit> , as well as activator protein- <dig>   <cit> , the ccaat/enhancer-binding protein beta   <cit> , and nuclear factor erythroid- <dig>   <cit> .

network analysis of the core response reveals scale-free, small world properties
to examine more closely the correlations between the genes of the core response to mab infection, we incorporated a network based approach using experimentally-validated interactions from the innatedb database  <cit> . the degree  was calculated for each node in the network, and a power law was fitted to the degree distribution of the network. this yielded an r <dig> value of  <dig>  and a correlation of  <dig> , suggesting that the network has a scale-free architecture, in which a small subset of nodes show a much higher degree of connectivity than the average  <cit> . this is a common property of cellular networks, in which certain nodes  show high connectivity and are referred to as hubs  <cit> .

scale-free biological networks tend to have a high clustering coefficient and a short mean path length between nodes, and are therefore be referred-to as “small-world” networks  <cit> . comparing the core response network to  <dig> randomly generated networks of an equivalent size  revealed that the clustering co-efficient  of the former  was ~ <dig>  times the mean c value  of random networks, while the average shortest path lengths  were similar . these values imply that the core response network has a small-world coefficient   <cit>  of  <dig>  , which is similar to that observed for other small-world biological networks  <cit> .

key hub and bottleneck genes of the core response network
the largest cluster of genes within the core response network consisted of  <dig> nodes connected via  <dig> edges . the genes with highest degrees of connectivity  and betweenness centrality  were stat <dig>  src, and egr <dig>  which were thus considered the primary hub and bottleneck nodes. in total, 97 % of genes within the network were linked to one of the  <dig> hub genes by a maximum of  <dig> edges , illustrating the prominence of these genes in mediating the core response. comparing this result to  <dig> randomly re-wired networks demonstrates that this degree of connectivity is significantly higher than would be expected due to chance  . the bc values of stat <dig>  src, and egr <dig> were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively, which are considerably higher than the network mean . similarly, their respective doc values  were much greater than the mean doc  .fig.  <dig> connectivity of the core response network. almost all of the genes within the core response  are linked via a maximum of  <dig> edges to a hub gene. edges between genes indicate a validated interaction, node size reflects the degree of connectivity , and node color indicates the minimum number of edges separating the node from the nearest hub gene



ifn generally potentiates macrophage activation via a stat1-dependent pathway and functional stat <dig> is essential to the host defense against mycobacterial infection  <cit> . src is known to be involved in regulating numerous downstream inflammatory signaling pathways and a similar network approach, using mtbc infection, found a central src hub of the host response network responsible for phagolysosome acidification and the induction of autophagy  <cit> . another study using high multiplicity mycobacterial infection identified egr <dig> downstream of an src/integrin signaling axis, resulting in the triggering of a nf-kb-mediated nlrp <dig> inflammasome response  <cit> . additionally, a recent study identified egr <dig> as part of the response network differentiating the macrophage responses to virulent and attenuated m. bovis strains  <cit> .

role of cytokine-mediated signalling
go enrichment analysis of the core response genes highlighted the importance of cytokine signaling pathways. cytokine and chemokine-encoding genes were upregulated in cells infected with both morphotypes, and generally with larger fold changes for mab-s-infected cells . a central role for cytokine-mediated signalling was also highlighted in a recent study comparing the thp- <dig> transcriptional responses to different mtb strains  <cit> . given that differing cytokine responses have been reported between mab-s and mab-r morphotypes , we also measured their levels in culture supernatants.

clear morphotype-specific differences in cytokine levels were observed, with mab-s eliciting a broadly stronger response . we detected higher levels of tnf-α in culture supernatants of mab-r-infected cells, consistent with previous reports that mab-s inhibits its induction  <cit> .fig.  <dig> measurements of cytokines and related proteins in cell supernatants. increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were observed in infected relative to uninfected cells. additionally, morphotype-specific variations in the levels of several pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were observed, with higher levels generally detected in mab-s-infected cells. asterisks indicate the level of statistical significance for morphotype-specific responses: * p ≤  <dig> , ** p ≤  <dig> , *** p ≤  <dig> 



both morphotypes elicited poor il- <dig> responses in the early stages of infection, with slightly increased induction at 24 hpi in mab-r-infected cells . the il-1β and il- <dig> responses were found to be more robust, with higher levels detected in response to mab-s infection . the latter result is in contrast to a previous study in epithelial cells, in which mab-r variants elicited increased expression of il- <dig> and hβd <dig>  <cit> .

chemokines are a family of small molecular mass  chemotactic cytokines that shape the host immune responses to both rapidly and slowly growing mycobacteria . both mab-r and mab-s induced the transcription of a number of cc-chemokine genes, including ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  and ccl <dig>  which are known to be potent leukocyte activators and chemo-attractants with important roles in granuloma formation  <cit> . measurement of the protein levels of ccl <dig> and ccl <dig> in the culture supernatants of macrophages infected with mab-r or mab-s revealed them to be significantly higher in the latter .

the convergence of these induced pro-inflammatory signalling pathways on the activation of the transcription factor nf-kb  <cit>  is consistent with the upregulation of genes encoding the nf-kb complex by both morphotypes, including nfkb <dig>  nfkb <dig>  rel, rela and relb.

we also found that mmp- <dig>  a metalloprotease involved in the remodeling of the extracellular matrix during the early events of granuloma formation  <cit> , was detected in the cell supernatants in response to infection by both morphotypes . mmp- <dig> functions in conjunction with numerous cell-surface adhesion molecules that were found to be upregulated at the transcriptional level, including itga <dig>  itga <dig>  tnfaip <dig>  cd <dig> and icam <dig>  which plays a role in mycobacterial cell invasion  <cit> .

morphotype-specific transcriptional responses
although mab-s elicited a more robust transcriptional response, a direct comparison between mab-r- and mab-s-infected cells showed the expression levels  of de genes to be highly correlated  across all comparable groups  . the high level of correlation holds at both  <dig> and 24 hpi, and suggests that mab-r and mab-s-infected macrophages respond in a broadly similar manner. correspondingly, just  <dig> and  <dig> de genes were identified in a direct comparison of mab-s and mab-r-infected cells at  <dig>  and 24 hpi, respectively. however, an analysis of this subset of genes suggests the potential for intriguing differences at the host-pathogen interface.fig.  <dig> correlation of gene expression between mab-r- and mab-s-infected cells. the log fold change  values of all de genes are shown for cells infected by both strains at 4 hpi  and 24 hpi . all groups of genes  show high levels of correlation , indicating the strong similarity of the transcriptional responses of macrophages to both strains



for example, the genes encoding lysosomal-associated membrane protein  <dig> , solute carrier family 7a member  <dig>  and metallothionein 2a  all show significantly increased expression in response to mab-s relative to mab-r. lamps are recruited to the mycobacterial phagosome and lamp- <dig> is often used as a marker of phagosomal fusion. studies in m. avium have shown that gpls elicit a delayed phagosomal maturation in a mannose receptor  dependent manner  <cit> . blocking or limiting of mr expression was found to increase phagosome-lysosome fusion, as indicated by a significant increase in the number of lysosomal marker cd63-positive m. avium phagosomes  <cit> . the gpls produced by mab are thought to be relatively inert, however gpls mask underlying cell wall mannosides and mannose-binding lectins bind more strongly to mab-r than to mab-s variants  <cit> . mab mr-mediated phagosome delay could therefore explain the lower levels of lamp- <dig> expression detected in mab-r-infected relative to mab-s-infected cells.

slc7a <dig>  a member of the slc7a family of cationic amino acid  transporters, is also upregulated in response to mab-s relative to mab-r. the slc7a family transporters are responsible for selective arginine uptake and the provision of arginine to various intracellular pools  <cit> . arginine is the sole substrate for the inducible nitric oxide synthase -catalysed formation of nitric oxide , which is utilized by activated macrophages to eliminate mycobacteria  <cit> . altered slc7a <dig> suggest the potential for differing localized inos activity, with consequences for the production of no and the extent of phagosome maturation between mab-r- and mab-s-infected cells.

finally, our observation of increased expression of the mt2a gene in response to mab-s relative to mab-r is noteworthy. metallothioneins are a family of membrane-bound proteins with important roles in the storage of heavy metals, including zinc  <cit> , and it has been shown that zinc accumulates in the mycobacterial phagosome  <cit> . during the course of mtb infection, however, mtb pumps zinc out of the phagosome and the resultant increase in cytosolic free zinc induces increased the expression of zinc storage metallothionein  genes, including mt2a  <cit> . our finding of increased expression of mt2a in mab-s-infected cells may reflect a more advanced level of phagosome maturation compared with mab-r-infected cells, resulting in differing levels of free zinc metal in the corresponding cells.

integration of mirna expression reveals networks of predicted targets among core response genes
we found a total of  <dig> mirnas to be de at 24 hpi,  <dig> of which were common to both mab-s- and mabs-r-infected cells . to study the functional significance of these shared de mirnas, we integrated their expression profiles with those of the core response genes and with mirna target predictions using toppmir  <cit> . toppmir assigns a score to each mirna given the functional relevance of its predicted targets . given that mirnas predominantly decrease the expression of their targets  <cit> , we looked for predicted interactions associated with inverse correlations in mirna and mrna expression levels. four of the top five ranked mirnas were found to comprise a cluster of predicted interactions with shared target mrnas . central within the cluster, and up-regulated in both mab-s and mab-r-infected cells at 24 hpi, is mir-181d, with  <dig> predicted interactions . mir-181d belongs to the mir- <dig> family, which mediates inflammatory responses through the regulation of pi3k and nf-κb signaling  <cit> , and it has been shown to be upregulated in dendritic cells upon infection with mtb  <cit> .fig.  <dig> integration of mirna expression patterns with core response genes. four of the top five ranked de mirnas from toppmir form an interconnected network of predicted interactions with target mrnas of the core response network. central to this network is mir-181d, which is regulated at 24 hpi in response to both mab-r and mab-s, and is predicted to interact with  <dig> core mrnas showing inverse expression patterns. logfc indicates the log fold change relative to uninfected cells



mir-193a-5p and mir-193b-3p are also both up-regulated at 24 hpi, and form part of the core network . increased expression of mir-193a-5p has been reported in patients with pulmonary tb as compared with healthy controls  <cit> . mir-193b-3p expression during mycobacterial infection has not been reported, however a previous study identified mir-193b-3p as one of the top circulating mirna in mice exposed to gram-positive bacterial infection, with the potential to differentiate gram-positive from gram-negative infections  <cit> . mir- <dig> has been shown to be downregulated upon the expression of the mtb latency-associated antigen hsp <dig>   <cit> , suggesting that its presence may be conducive towards productive infection.

mir- <dig>  which is induced by variety of bacterial pathogens including m. avium , as part of the antimicrobial response in macrophages, was induced exclusively in mab-s-infected cells at 24 hpi. other mirnas specific to mab-s-infected cells have also been found to differ in their expression levels between different strains of mtb  or between latent and active tuberculosis   <cit> . the role of a subset of de mirnas in the disease progression of cystic fibrosis has also been described. both the 5p and 3p arms of mir- <dig> were significantly down-regulated in mab-s-infected cells compared to uninfected controls by 24 hpi. this mirna has been shown to be differentially regulated in cf versus non-cf airway epithelial cells, and is thought to play an important role in regulating innate immune responses in the cf lung  <cit> . it has been hypothesized that mir- <dig> dysregulation in the cf lung may engender a tlr hyporesponsive state, which renders it less able to provide a rapid and robust immune response to aggravating infections  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
a robust core pattern of gene expression was observed upon infection with both mab-s and mab-r variants compatible with a tlr <dig> initiated signaling cascade, leading to the activation of nuclear factor kappa b  and resulting in a pro-inflammatory cytokine response. a network analysis highlighted the importance of type-i-interferon and cytokine-mediated signaling to the core response, and identified three key hub transcription factors . ifn-α and ifn-β were not reported among the de genes in our dataset, suggesting that, despite the strong activation of the type-i- interferon pathway, other mechanisms may interfere downstream in the cascade of the events that lead to the ifn production. in particular, we noticed that tmem <dig>  coding for the stimulator of interferon genes , a downstream signaling adaptor required by rlrs , was significantly down regulated in macrophages infected by both mab variants. indeed, it has been reported that mtb induces ifn production during macrophage infection via the activation of a sting/tbk1/irf <dig> signaling axis  <cit> .

the cytokine response was found to be pronounced at both the rna and protein levels, with the latter also revealing morphotype-specific abundances and higher levels of key signaling molecules in response to the mab-s morphotype. given the potential of mab to form granulomatous lesions  <cit> , it is likely that the secretion of these chemokines could help to create an early pro-inflammatory cell-rich niche in vivo, which facilitates the clearance of the bacilli. upregulation of ddx <dig> and ifih <dig> genes, coding for the rig-i and mda <dig> proteins respectively, suggest a host response to the leakage of bacterial nucleic acids into the cytosol. rig-i signalling was seen to be over-represented in a recent transcriptomics study of m. bovis-infected bovine mdm  <cit> . the host mirna response to mab shows clear parallels with the responses observed to other mycobacterial pathogens, and appears to become more robust upon the adaptation of mab to its host during the later stages of infection.

a number of previous studies have looked at the transcriptional differences between related strains of mtb with differing virulence and cell wall properties  <cit>  and the results paint a complex picture. a study comparing mtb and cell wall deficient  mtb found the cwd forms stimulated lower levels of macrophage activation relative to the wild-type  <cit> . another study involving mtb clinical strains cdc <dig> and the hyper-virulent hn <dig> strain identified hn <dig> as eliciting a weaker early response, which then strengthened over time  <cit> . in both studies, host gene expression differences could be identified, including those encoding products involved in lipid metabolism and autophagy  <cit> . these studies are compatible with our finding of a poor early response to the more virulent mab-r, relative to mab-s, and the limited differences that separate them are enriched in genes associated with phagosome maturation. the results may point to differences in the manner that mab-r is processed in the host macrophage relative to mab-s, as previous work has shown that these morphotypes can reside in phagosomes of differing morphologies  <cit> . differences in the induction of phagosomal maturation by rough and smooth variants, with the latter displaying a lesser capacity to inhibit phagosome maturation, have also been reported for mtb  <cit> . the potential for mab-r to produce cords during infection could offer an explanation as to the potential for differing levels of phagosome maturation  <cit> .

it is prudent, however, to interpret the limited number of transcriptional differences between morphotypes in the context of the high levels of correlation which were observed overall in expression patterns of de genes. in the absence of functional data, it is not possible to determine the extent to which the subset of morphotype-specific de genes contribute towards differing immune outcomes. recent rna-seq studies have questioned the role of such strain-specific transcriptional differences in eliciting differing immune responses. a large study comparing core response of thp- <dig> cells to infection with a wide variety of mtb strains  <cit> , for example, found such differences difficult to link confidently to differing immune responses.

in summary, we find that the overall early responses of thp1-derived macrophages to mab-s and mab-r to be highly similar at the level of transcription, with the small numbers of differences having the potential to presage differing fates for the morphotypes later in the infection cycle. our data should provide a platform for future studies in the functional genomics of host response to the r and s forms of mab.
