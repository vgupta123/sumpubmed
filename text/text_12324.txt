BACKGROUND
the bacterial cell wall biosynthesis pathway represents the most validated source of antibacterial targets. the pathway encodes essential and highly conserved enzymes with no eukaryotic counterparts, the inhibition of which leading to bacterial cell death  <cit> . the first step of the pathway is catalyzed by the cytoplasmic enzymes mura through murf, which synthesize udp-n-acetylmuramyl-pentapeptide . membrane translocases mray and murg then add the undecaprenyl-phosphate lipid carrier and n-acetylglucosamine to form lipid ii. this precursor is translocated to the periplasm and linked to the growing cell wall polymer by the transglycosylation and transpeptidation actions of penicillin-binding proteins . the cell wall layer, composed of alternating units of udp-n-acetylglucosamine and udp-n-acetylmuramic acid cross-linked via short peptide chains , maintains cell shape and integrity  <cit> .

while several clinically useful antibiotics interfere with this pathway  <cit> , no antibacterial agents target the atp-dependent mur ligase enzymes  that perform the non-ribosomal stepwise addition of the five amino acids forming the cell wall peptide moiety . this under-exploitation may be partially explained by the lack of commercially available nucleotide substrates for studying these enzymes  <cit> .

we selected murf as a specific target. murf catalyzes the formation of a peptide bond between d-ala-d-ala and the nucleotide precursor udp-n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanyl-d-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelic acid  with the concomitant hydrolysis of atp to adp and inorganic phosphate, yielding udp-n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanyl-d-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelyl-d-alanyl-dalanine  <cit> . while the roles of murc, murd and mure may be substituted in a single step by the muropeptide ligase mpl involved in cell wall recycling  <cit> , murf remains the sole d-ala-d-ala adding enzyme  <cit> . the murf active site is highly conserved among all medically relevant bacteria  <cit> . strict limitation to d-amino acid substrates  <cit>  also makes murf an especially attractive target for the development of antibacterial agents. these amino acids are metabolized only in prokaryotes  <cit> , and d-ala-d-ala plays a critical role in cell wall cross-linking  <cit> . furthermore, normally functioning murf is essential for proper cell division, optimal expression of methicillin resistance in staphylococcus aureus  <cit>  and glycopeptide resistance mechanism  <cit> .

since murf acts on a dipeptide to form bonds of a highly distinctive type, we investigated the possibility of inhibiting this enzyme with peptide ligands from a phage display library. phage display screening allows the selection of peptides having specific binding affinities for a targeted protein and has proven useful for identification of various enzyme inhibitors including murc and murd  <cit> . the results we present herein constitute the first report of a peptide inhibitor of murf. we focused this effort on the gram-negative bacterium pseudomonas aeruginosa, an ubiquitous opportunistic pathogen responsible for a variety of chronic nosocomial infections such as lung infection in cystic fibrosis patients  <cit> . p. aeruginosa is one of the most difficult microorganisms to combat due to high level of resistance to most antibiotics  <cit> .

RESULTS
purification of biologically active murf enzyme
the purified murf protein was visualized as a single  <dig> kda band on sds-page . n-terminal sequencing of the first  <dig> amino acid residues confirmed its identity as p. aeruginosa murf ligase  . murf biological activity was confirmed by mass spectrometric identification of the cytoplasmic cell wall precursor udp-n-acetylmuramyl pentapeptide synthesized in vitro in the presence of the purified enzymes mura, murb, murc, murd and mure  <cit> .

affinity selection of murf binding peptides
as shown in table  <dig>  each of the three rounds of bio-panning selected only a fraction of the phage input, which decreased from approximately  <dig> down to  <dig> plaque forming units . the third round gave a lower phage recovery compared to the two previous rounds, indicating a strong selection of specific murf-interacting peptide sequences at this step. each elution strategy employed at the end of the third round gave similar phage recovery yields. indeed, the competitive elution conditions using specific murf substrates were as effective as the well-known glycine-hcl elution strategy.

the different elution conditions allowed the selection of different peptide sequences with specific motifs . analysis of the frequency of peptide sequence recovery and conserved motifs identified the consensus sequence tmgftaprfphy, called murfp <dig>  this peptide sequence was principally selected by the glycine-hcl elution strategy and was also recovered by competitive elutions . murfp <dig> was rich in hydrophobic aromatic residues, p residues and basic residues but contained no acidic or polar residues. the n-terminal t residue and the basic r residue of murfp <dig> were particularly conserved, especially in the atp and d-ala-d-ala elution groups. two hydrophobic aromatic residues or two p residues often occurred close to each other in the selected peptide sequences as they do in the consensus sequence. p residues occurred mostly near a hydrophobic aromatic residue or a basic residue, as in murfp <dig> sequence . apart for murfp <dig> found in more than one elution group, the sequence vsanrhlggnlp indicated by a star in figure  <dig> was recovered once by both the atp and d-ala-d-ala elutions. elution with glycine-hcl gave two sequences with a "srl" motif, which was absent in the other elution groups. among the atp elution group, two sequences presented a "yst" motif also absent in the other elution groups. the vast majority of the sequences eluted with d-ala-d-ala presented hydrophobic residues near small residues. the d-ala-d-ala elution group recovered more small amino acids than the other groups. overall, the competitive elutions yielded to more sequence diversity than the glycine-hcl elution.

bioinformatic analysis
the theoretical pi of murfp <dig> was  <dig> , indicating that the peptide would be positively charged at physiological ph. murfp <dig> contains a single amino acid  that would bear this positive charge and no amino acid bearing a counter-balancing negative charge. the protparam tool estimated the half-life of murfp <dig> at more than  <dig> hours in escherichia coli in vivo and at  <dig>  hours in mammalian reticulocytes in vitro. the secondary structure prediction tools indicated with relative certainty a random coil structure. the fasts <dig> program did not identify any relevant protein in the uniprot database having similarities to murfp <dig> 

synthesis and purification of udp-murnac-ala-glu-meso-a2pm
analysis of udp-murnac-ala-glu-meso-a2pm synthesized by the p. aeruginosa enzymes mura, murb, murc, murd and mure by fplc anionic exchange indicated a purity of 95%. the structure of the purified udp-murnac-ala-glu-meso-a2pm product was confirmed by mass spectrometry .

characterization of murf activity
the controls performed without murf or without any one of the substrates did not yield any phosphate from atp , indicating that the reaction mixture was devoid of contaminating atpase activities that might interfere with the assay. the optimal atp concentration was  <dig> mm and murf reached noticeable activity with  <dig> μm of udp-murnac-ala-glu-meso-a2pm . steady state kinetic analysis indicated that murf obeyed michaelis-menten kinetics, reaching a maximal specific activity of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μmole/min/mg at  <dig> mm d-ala-d-ala with a km of  <dig> ±  <dig> μm . addition of nacl to the reaction buffer improved murf activity by a factor of  <dig>  . the enzyme was very sensitive to the buffer ph, with maximal activity at ph  <dig> . the kcat value indicated that each murf active site performed about  <dig> ligations of d-ala-d-ala to udp-murnac-ala-glu-meso-a2pm and hydrolyzed about  <dig> atp molecules per min, releasing the same amount of adp and inorganic phosphate in accordance with the known stoichiometric relationship   <cit> .

inhibitory kinetics of murfp1
murfp <dig> was first shown to be a weak time-dependent inhibitor of murf. the inhibition increased as a function of pre-incubation time, following an overall linear relationship. at a concentration of  <dig> mm, murfp <dig> inhibited 50% of murf activity subsequent to a 30-minute pre-incubation time .

adding udp-murnac-ala-glu-meso-a2pm or atp during the pre-incubation step unexpectedly increased the inhibitory action of murfp <dig>  an effect less pronounced for atp . murf reaction velocity in the absence of inhibitor was similar with or without udp-murnac-ala-glu-meso-a2pm or atp in the pre-incubation step. murfp <dig> inhibited murf eight times more efficiently when udp-murnac-ala-glu-a2pm was added to the 30-minute pre-incubation step, giving an ic <dig> value of  <dig> ±  <dig> μm. the inhibition curve displayed a linear dose-response trend having variable slopes as shown in figure  <dig> 

the presence of d-ala-d-ala during the pre-incubation step nullified the inhibition of murf by murfp <dig> . murf reaction velocity in the absence of inhibitor was nearly identical with or without d-ala-d-ala in the pre-incubation step. the ki of murfp <dig> was determined with respect to the d-ala-d-ala substrate, with a  <dig> min pre-incubation of murf with udp-murnac-ala-glu-a2pm and murfp <dig>  the km values of murf for d-ala-d-ala remained almost the same for each murfp <dig> concentration used to determine the ki while the vmax of murf decreased significantly as a function of murfp <dig> concentration . at  <dig> μm murfp <dig>  the vmax of murf was three times lower than for the uninhibited reaction . the slopes and the y-intercept of the fitted lines of the lineweaver-burk plot varied with murfp <dig> concentration , indicating a catalytic and specific component in the inhibition. the common intersection point of the fitted lines of the lineweaver-burk plot was positioned at the left of the ordinate and below the abscissa , indicating a reversible mixed type of inhibition against d-ala-d-ala. this inhibition type was further identified as the most suitable model of inhibition, based on statistical convergence to the experimental data according to the runs test, giving the highest r <dig> value , the lowest akaike value  and the lowest standard deviation of the residuals . the non-competitive type of inhibition was the second best model, giving statistical values close to the mixed model of inhibition . the ki value of murfp <dig> was  <dig> ±  <dig> μm for the mixed type of inhibition against d-ala-d-ala, and  <dig> ±  <dig> μm for the non-competitive model. the a parameter indicated that murfp <dig> binding to the murf-d-ala-d-ala complex  did not significantly change murf affinity for d-ala-d-ala. the β parameter indicated that the rate constant of es breaking down to enzyme and product dropped when murfp <dig> was bound to es .

kinetic parameters were monitored with a pre-incubation of  <dig> min with murf, murfp <dig> and udp-murnac-ala-glu-meso-a2pm.

a non-specific 12-mer peptide pre-incubated for  <dig> min with murf with or without udp-murnac-ala-glu-a2pm did not inhibit murf activity . the reactions were performed in the presence of excess bovine serum albumin, suggesting that murfp <dig> did not interact non-specifically with proteins.

discussion
phage display screening of murf yielded to the identification of the peptide inhibitor murfp <dig>  the reduction of the contact time between the phages and murf during the third round of bio-panning allowed the selection of specific murf-interacting peptides. this selection pattern was also observed for phage display screening of the amide ligase murd  <cit> . in contrast, selection of specific murc-interacting peptides occurred earlier in the phage display screening  <cit> . phage display screenings of p. aeruginosa proteins ftsa, ftsz, murc, murd and murf done under similar conditions did not identify any redundant sequences  <cit> .

the atpase activity of murf has been shown to depend on the presence of both d-ala-d-ala and udp-murnac-ala-glu-a2pm  <cit> . we developed a simple, rapid, sensitive, reliable and inexpensive assay to quantify murf atpase activity using the lanzetta reagent. in opposite to other methods used to measure murf enzymatic activity  <cit> , our assay does not involve any radioactive isotope or additional enzyme, making high-throughput screening for murf inhibitors more suitable. the maximal specific activity measured with this assay  is comparable to the published value for the p. aeruginosa murf enzyme   <cit> . the km value determined for d-ala-d-ala with p. aeruginosa murf  is in the same range as values published previously for this enzyme and for its e. coli, bacillus and streptococcus faecalis equivalents  <cit> . this km value is roughly equal to the concentration of the d-ala-d-ala intracellular pool in e. coli, established at  <dig> μm  <cit> .

it has been shown that the binding order for substrates to mur ligases begins with atp, followed by the nucleotide substrate and ending with the amino acid  <cit> . it has been further demonstrated that the nucleotide substrate binds efficiently to murd without atp, inducing conformational changes in the c-terminal and n-terminal domains of the protein  <cit> . to explain how murfp <dig> could be a stronger inhibitor following pre-incubation with udp-murnac-ala-glu-meso-a2pm, we hypothesize that binding of the nucleotide substrate to murf induces a structural change that optimizes binding and/or activity of murfp <dig>  e. coli murf crystal structure indicates that udp-murnac-ala-glu-meso-a2pm interacts mainly with the n-terminal domain, atp binds principally to the central domain and d-ala-d-ala interacts at the c-terminus  <cit> . the n-terminal domain of murf binds the uracyl ring of udp but does not present the typical nucleotide-binding fold. indeed, part of the central domain of murf extends out towards the n-terminal domain to bind the pyrophosphate portion of the nucleotide substrate  <cit> . this suggests a conformational change upon udp-murnac-ala-glu-meso-a2pm binding and could explain why atp binding to the central domain also increased inhibition by murfp <dig>  to our knowledge, we have presented the first compound having mur ligase inhibitory action that is enhanced by pre-incubation with the nucleotide substrate. however, appropriately substituted phosphinate inhibitors of atp-dependent amide-forming enzymes depend on their phosphorylation via the atp substrate. these atp-dependent phosphinate analogues exhibit a transition-state time-dependent inhibition closely mimicking the tetrahedral intermediate involved in mur ligase reactions  <cit> .

based on classical interpretation of our kinetic and statistical data, murfp <dig> is a reversible mixed inhibitor. murfp <dig> acted as a competitive inhibitor since the inhibition was reversed by addition of d-ala-d-ala during pre-incubation, and the slopes of fitted lines from lineweaver-burk plot increased as a function of murfp <dig> concentration, revealing an increase in inhibitor binding strength  <cit> . like a non-competitive inhibitor that interferes with substrate utilization without directly competing for the substrate binding site, murfp <dig> inhibits murf at high or low substrate concentrations, the vmax of murf decreasing as a function of murfp <dig> concentration and the y-intercept of lineweaver-burk plot varying as a function of murfp <dig>  murfp <dig> appears not to alter murf affinity for d-ala-d-ala but rather inhibit breakdown of the enzyme-substrate complex to enzyme and product. indeed, murfp <dig> acted more like a non-competitive inhibitor than a competitive inhibitor. murfp <dig> must bind elsewhere than at the d-ala-d-ala binding site. however, phage display and kinetic data indicated that d-ala-d-ala released murfp <dig> from the murf surface. we speculate that d-ala-d-ala interaction with murf can enhance conformational changes that displace murfp <dig>  it should be noted that the glycine elution yielded to a better selection of murfp <dig> than the d-ala-d-ala competitive elution. furthermore, reversion of the inhibition is only noticeable when d-ala-d-ala is added to the pre-incubation step without the two remaining substrates. in a physiologic environment, such nullification of the inhibition would not be expected as murfp <dig> inhibits murf at high d-ala-d-ala concentrations. since d-ala:d-ala ligases  are highly sensitive to feed-back inhibition by their d-ala-d-ala product  <cit> , the inhibitory potential of murfp <dig> may be amplified in physiologic conditions.

murfp <dig> could exert inhibition by sequestering d-ala-d-ala or interfering with murf structural changes necessary for substrate proximity and amide bond formation  <cit> . it will be of primary interest to investigate the exact binding site of murfp <dig> and whether it affects murf conformation by co-crystallization of the murf-murfp <dig> complex with each individual substrate. this will yield valuable information for further directed optimization of the inhibitor by medicinal chemistry and peptidomimetism  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
as a first step into the development of novel inhibitors targeting unexploited bacterial targets, we have identified the first peptide inhibitor of the essential murf amide ligase enzyme using a phage display approach. the nucleotide substrate udp-murnac-ala-glu-meso-a2pm was synthesized and used to develop a sensitive murf enzymatic assay. the 12-mer peptide murfp <dig> acted as a time-dependent inhibitor of murf activity and its inhibitory potential increased significantly when murf was pre-incubated with udp-murnac-ala-glu-meso-a2pm. murfp <dig> presumably exploits udp-murnac-ala-glu-meso-a2pm-induced structural changes for better interaction with the enzyme. the peptide inhibits the utilization of d-ala-d-ala by murf, preventing the breakdown of the enzyme-substrate complex to enzyme and product with an ic <dig> value of  <dig> μm and a ki value of  <dig> μm. the discovery of this unique inhibitor opens the path to the rational design of a new generation of antibacterial agents inhibiting the bacterial cell wall biosynthesis.
