BACKGROUND
wound healing is a complex process that involves sequential phases that overlap in time and space, interact, and affect each other dynamically both at the gene and protein levels. in addition, crosstalk between cells and the surrounding microenvironment contributes to the processes of clot formation, inflammation, granulation tissue development, and remodeling. many different lines of experimental evidence have shown that the basic cellular and molecular mechanisms that result in these events involve cell adhesion/de-adhesion, migration, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. one important process initiated during the early stages of healing is re-epithelialization; it involves the proliferation, migration, and differentiation of keratinocytes from the wound margins  <cit> . appropriate re-epithelialization requires not only the development of a continuous epidermal layer but also full epidermal differentiation and the formation of junctions between the epidermis and dermis. because the epidermis provides a barrier against infection and maintains homeostasis, improving re-epithelialization, particularly in impaired healing situations, has attracted a great deal of attention. one molecule with the potential to enhance these processes is insulin, a hormone known to maintain the growth and development of different cell types. it can affect the proliferation, migration  <cit> , and ecm secretion by keratinocytes, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts  <cit> .

the use of insulin for non-diabetic purposes was popular in the early part of the 20th century  <cit> , was "forgotten" during the 40's and 50's, and it became again reinvigorated during the latter half of the century. for example, daily injections of insulin were used to improve bone healing in rats  <cit> , incision wounds of the skin  <cit> , healing in the distal limb of horses  <cit> , and in cutaneous ulcerations in diabetic and non-diabetic mice  <cit> . insulin was also used in the 60's to treat diabetic wounds in humans  <cit> , and more recently, insulin spray has been successfully used to treat patients with diabetic ulcers. furthermore, this hormone has been used to treat burns in humans  <cit> , rats  <cit> , and rabbits  <cit>  with good success. in addition to the studies in vivo, experiments with cultured cells have shown that insulin increases the rate of growth of fibroblasts, cells that are critically involved in the development of the granulation tissue  <cit> , suggesting that insulin can function as a growth hormone  <cit> . nevertheless, despite the strong evidence that insulin stimulates healing and thereby decreases the time of wound closure, the underlying mechanisms of insulin-induced improved healing are far from understood.

here we show that local application of insulin to excision wounds stimulates keratinocyte migration and differentiation, and that this is dependent on activation of the pi3k-akt pathway, followed by activation of rac <dig>  and that the integrin α <dig> and the ecm molecule laminin  <dig> , are critical. we also show that insulin stimulates a regenerative process in the wound tissue. therefore, insulin may prove to be useful in the treatment of chronic wounds, dental/gum healing problems, and burns. these are important findings because issues of impaired healing and of lack of tissue regeneration have implications for numerous health- and financially-related problems in this country and elsewhere. the understanding of key elements of the signaling pathways induced by insulin during stimulation of healing can lead to the development of analogs that will function strictly in the healing process.

RESULTS
topical application of insulin accelerates and improves the quality of healing
to study the effects of insulin on wound healing,  <dig> mm diameter excision wounds were performed on the back of c57bl/6j mice, and locally treated with  <dig>  u of insulin. this dose of insulin was chosen because it significantly stimulated healing  without affecting blood glucose levels . we analyzed the wound area throughout the healing process to monitor the time-dependent effects of insulin on healing, and found that in wounds treated with insulin the wound area was significantly decreased at several time points , as was the time to closure . we found that insulin significantly decreased wound area by day  <dig> after injury. in order to elucidate the effects of insulin during this early stage of healing, we took skin samples from control and insulin-treated wounds, and compared the histological characteristics of these two wounds. at day  <dig>  we found that in insulin-treated wounds the keratinocyte tongue was much longer than that in the control wounds, suggesting that insulin stimulates keratinocyte migration . when we measured the extent of migration of the keratinocytes by determining the length of migration of the tongue from the margin of the wound to the tip of the migrating keratinocytes, we found that there was a significant increase in migration distance of the keratinocytes in insulin-treated wounds . furthermore, we also found that following wound closure, the epidermis of insulin-treated wounds is better defined and is characterized by an increased number of epidermal reticular ridges and dermal papilla that are not evident in the control .

insulin stimulates keratinocyte migration in a time- and dose-dependent manner
histological observation of wounds treated with insulin suggests that this protein stimulates keratinocyte migration. although the effects of insulin on keratinocyte proliferation are well established  <cit> , its effect on migration of these cells is not clear. to study the latter process, we used hacat keratinocytes in culture. cells were plated in cloning rings and allowed to attach; the rings were removed after marking their positions and the cells were then treated with insulin. migration distances from the initial edge of the cells to the new edge of the cells were measured at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hr. at each time point, keratinocytes treated with insulin showed increased migration over the control . to determine whether this effect is dose-dependent, we performed the migration assays with different doses of insulin. a concentration as low as 10- <dig> m insulin was able to increase keratinocyte migration, which was highly significant after  <dig> hr of treatment. however, concentrations ranging from 10- <dig> m to 10- <dig> m significantly enhanced keratinocyte migration by  <dig> h . to eliminate the possibility that this migration is dependent on proliferation, we treated the cells with mitomycin c, a potent dna crosslinker and hence inhibitor of cell proliferation, in the presence or absence of insulin. cells were pre-treated with  <dig> μg/ml of mitomycin c for  <dig> hrs and then exposed to 10- <dig> m insulin for  <dig> and  <dig> hrs. although we observed that proliferation was halted, insulin-induced migration was not , strongly suggesting that the two processes are independently regulated by this hormone.

insulin stimulates keratinocyte migration in an insulin receptor-dependent manner but in an egf-independent manner
it has been shown that insulin activates both its own receptor and the igf- <dig> receptor, albeit with different affinities  <cit> . these transmembrane proteins are both tyrosine kinases, share 60% homology, and activate a number of insulin receptor substrates which then initiate signals that lead to gene expression. these genes are involved in many of the different effects of insulin on cells and ecm molecules, as well as their receptors such as integrins, which provide critical signals to guide cell movement. to determine whether insulin-induced keratinocyte migration is dependent on one or both receptors, each group of cells was pre-treated with either the neutralizing insulin receptor ab, 29b <dig>  or the igf- <dig> receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, picropodophyllin and then treated with 10- <dig> m or 10- <dig> m insulin. pre-treatment of keratinocytes with the insulin receptor ab followed by 10- <dig> m insulin treatment completely abolished insulin-induced migration, suggesting that at this concentration these effects are primarily mediated by the insulin receptor itself . when cells were treated with the insulin receptor ab and 10- <dig> m insulin, the ab only partially blocked insulin-induced migration , suggesting that this concentration of insulin may induce migration through both the insulin and igf receptors. to confirm these results, we pre-incubated the cells with picropodophyllin for  <dig> hr and then treated them with insulin. at 10- <dig> m, insulin-induced keratinocyte migration was not affected, but the inhibitor did decrease cell migration induced by 10- <dig> m insulin . moreover, the keratinocyte migration resulting from 10- <dig> m insulin was abrogated when inhibiting both insulin and igf receptors using the 29b <dig> ab and picropodophyllin . taken together, these data show that the effect of high concentration  of insulin on keratinocyte migration is mediated by both insulin and igf- <dig> receptors, whereas the effect of lower concentrations of insulin  is primarily mediated by the insulin receptor. to study the effects of insulin that are mediated only through the insulin receptor and its associated downstream signaling pathways, 10- <dig> m insulin was chosen for the subsequent studies except when otherwise indicated.

our previous studies showed that insulin stimulates egf expression in wound marginal keratinocytes of deep partial thickness scald wounds in rats  <cit> . in order to exclude the potential autocrine effects of egf secretion on insulin-induced keratinocyte migration, we treated the keratinocytes with ag <dig>  a selective inhibitor of egf-r kinase, prior to treatment with insulin and measured migration distances at  <dig> and  <dig> h. this egf-r inhibitor did not inhibit the effects of insulin on keratinocyte migration , suggesting that this process does not require egf or its receptor.

pi-3k and akt mediate insulin-induced keratinocyte migration
in order to determine the signal transduction pathways in insulin-induced keratinocyte migration, we examined akt phosphorylation/activation by immunoblot analysis  <cit> , and found that the levels of phosphorylation of this signal transduction mediator increased after  <dig> min of insulin treatment, and remained elevated for at least  <dig> min . this effect was also dose-dependent . to determine whether akt phosphorylation/activation was involved in insulin-induced keratinocyte migration, we infected keratinocytes with recombinant adenovirus expressing the constitutively active mutant of akt  or the dominant-negative mutant of akt . higher levels of p-akt were found in the keratinocytes expressing akt-ca even without insulin treatment when compared to cells expressing the akt-dn . to determine whether akt phosphorylation is important in keratinocyte migration, we used the scratch wound migration assay. this assay was used to avoid trypsinizing and re-plating the cells because the viral infected cells have decreased survival. we compared keratinocyte migration distances with or without insulin treatment, in cells expressing the akt mutants . uninfected cells and cells infected with the null vector and then treated with insulin as well as cells infected with the akt-ca, with or without insulin treatment, displayed the longest migration distance. in contrast, cells infected with akt-dn exhibited a significant decrease in migration, even with insulin treatment, compared with all other groups, illustrating the requirement of akt for insulin-induced keratinocyte migration.

pi3k is often involved in akt phosphorylation. therefore, to determine whether insulin stimulation of keratinocyte migration is dependent on pi3k activity, we performed the migration assays in the presence of ly <dig>  an inhibitor of pi3k. this treatment completely blocked keratinocyte migration stimulated by insulin , showing the importance of pi3k in this process. the dose of ly <dig> we used does not inhibit s <dig> kinase, which is the effector of mtor, nor does it affect map kinase, pkc, or pi4k  <cit> .

insulin stimulates translocation of rac <dig>  but not rhoa, to the plasma membrane; this process requires pi3k-akt activation and is involved in insulin-induced keratinocyte migration and wound healing
small gtpases of the rhoa family play important roles in cell motility. therefore, we tested the possibility that the pi3k-akt pathway stimulates rhoa activation during insulin-induced keratinocyte migration. using immunolabeling, we show that there was no significant difference in rhoa distribution shortly after insulin treatment  nor did a change occur at least for  <dig> h. however,  <dig> min after insulin treatment, rac <dig>  another member of the rhoa family of gtpases, translocated from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, indicating its activation . this redistribution effect was also seen after  <dig> min of insulin treatment . in addition, plasma membrane ruffling was observed at the leading edge of migrating keratinocytes, with rac- <dig> being present in the membrane of ruffles . to determine whether this translocation is consistent with the activation of rac <dig>  we performed rac <dig> pull down assays, which can specifically pull down the active form of rac, and found elevated levels of active rac <dig> after insulin treatment . in order to confirm that rac <dig> activation is important in insulin-induced keratinocyte migration, we transfected keratinocytes with plasmids containing mutant forms of rac <dig>  and then observed the effects of these mutants on insulin-stimulated cell migration. keratinocytes were transfected with either the constitutively active form of rac <dig> , dominant-negative mutant rac <dig> , or wild type rac <dig> .  <dig> h after transfection, scratch wounds were made in the cell cultures, and cell migration distances were measured in non-transfected and transfected cells. after treatment for  <dig> h, insulin stimulated migration in non-transfected cells, as well as in cells transfected with rac1-ca or rac1-wt. cells transfected with rac1-ca showed increased migration, even without insulin treatment. however, insulin-induced migration was eliminated in cells transfected with rac1-dn . to determine whether the pi3k-akt pathway is required for insulin-induced rac <dig> activation/translocation, ly <dig> was used to pre-treat the cells before insulin treatment. insulin-induced rac <dig> activation  and translocation  was inhibited by this pi3k inhibitor.

insulin stimulates integrin a <dig> and ln <dig> production, which contributes to insulin-induced keratinocyte migration and wound healing
it is well known that the rac <dig> gtpase is critical in cytoskeleton re-organization, that the cytoskeleton interacts with integrins on the cell surface, and that these integrins interact with ecm molecules. it is also known that the integrin α3β <dig> and ln <dig>  a basement membrane  component, are important in both keratinocyte migration and bm development. therefore, we investigated the possibility that insulin modulates ln <dig> and integrin α3β <dig> expression in vitro and in vivo, and that these proteins are involved in insulin-induced wound healing. keratinocytes were seeded in cloning rings in order to observe the integrin α <dig> and ln <dig> at the migration edge. immunolabeling for integrin α <dig> showed higher levels of this protein on the cell membrane after insulin treatment . the increased integrin α <dig> levels were confirmed by immunoblot analysis .

using similar methodology, ln <dig> was also found to be elevated after insulin treatment, particularly at the migrating edge, with deposition of ln <dig> along the cell membrane in some cells . immunoblot analysis showed an increase in the ln <dig> protein after insulin treatment . to determine whether these observations translate into changes in the migratory behavior of keratinocytes, we observed the effect of function-inhibiting abs to integrin α <dig> and ln <dig> on insulin-induced keratinocyte migration . cell migration was inhibited when integrin α <dig> or ln <dig> were blocked with these abs, while basal migration remained virtually unaffected. the effects of these blocking antibodies were more obvious after  <dig> h of insulin treatment; at this time point, functional blocking of α <dig> and ln <dig> affected both basal and insulin-induced keratinocyte migration. moreover, additional inhibition was observed when insulin treatment was accompanied by treatment with both integrin α <dig> and ln <dig> function-inhibiting abs .

these results suggest that in vivo both α <dig> and ln <dig> are involved in insulin-induced acceleration of wound closure. to test this possibility, we applied the function-blocking abs against both proteins to mouse excision wounds, and found that inhibition of ln <dig>  or integrin α <dig>  resulted in delays in healing, primarily at early times after wounding. histological examination shortly after wound closure showed that both inhibition of ln <dig> or integrin α <dig> resulted in a less mature epidermis . when the antibodies to these two molecules were applied, no reticular ridges were seen, the basal cells were not well defined, the interactions of the epidermis with the dermis were less well defined, and appendages were not seen. furthermore, staining for collagen iv , a component of basement membrane, showed that in the wounds treated with the function-inhibiting abs for ln <dig>  the basement membrane was not well developed, and when treated with α <dig> integrin, the basement membrane was irregular containing many dense areas of collagen iv deposition . when we stained for keratin  <dig> , a marker of keratinocyte differentiation  <cit> , the basal keratinocytes of the wounds treated with the inhibiting antibodies did not express keratin  <dig>  these results suggest that insulin promotes epithelial basement membrane deposition and keratinocyte differentiation.

discussion
previous work has shown that insulin improves wound healing, but the mechanisms of its action on healing have not been delineated. we used a variety of cell and molecular approaches to determine the effects of insulin on cutaneous wounds and have shown that insulin:  stimulates keratinocyte migration in a dose- and time-dependent manner;  acts in an insulin-receptor-dependent but egf/egf-r-independent manner;  stimulates keratinocyte migration through the pi3k-akt-rac <dig> pathway;  stimulates keratinocytes to produce integrin α <dig> and ln <dig>  and cell migration in vitro and in vivo is dependent on these molecules. the ability of this hormone to stimulate a variety of cell functions important for wound healing in an insulin-receptor-dependent manner creates the ability to target processes that are dependent only on insulin. conversely, the ability to stimulate both the insulin and igf- <dig> receptors may broaden the applicability of insulin in different wound conditions, particularly when one receptor may be missing or dysfunctional .

understanding the processes by which insulin accelerates wound closure is important because it will provide insight into potential manipulation of the healing process using this hormone as well as the signaling molecules it activates. the results presented here show that stimulation of keratinocyte migration by insulin involves the pi3k-akt pathway, and identifies rac <dig>  a small gtpase, as a molecule activated downstream of pi3k-akt. support for these conclusions includes the fact that these molecules are activated upon insulin stimulation, and inhibition of each molecule with specific inhibitors or dominant negative proteins prevents insulin-induced keratinocyte migration.

rac <dig> is known to regulate actin assembly  <cit>  and to stimulate formation of lamellipodia  <cit> , thereby promoting cell movement in response to external signals from cytokines, growth factors and/or the ecm. our results support insulin-induced rac <dig> activation in keratinocytes, as shown by rac <dig> translocation from the cytosol to the cell membrane, the formation of membrane ruffles upon insulin stimulation, and the increased levels of active rac <dig> identified by the pull down assay. moreover, we show that rac <dig> activation is dependent on the pi3k-akt signaling pathway in keratinocyte migration. two recent papers showed a strong activation of the pi3k pathway in the wound margin keratinocytes  <cit> . furthermore, epidermal growth factor  or heregulin  have been found to stimulate keratinocyte migration through pi3k/akt signaling  <cit> . these results, coupled with our findings presented here, show that insulin can replace some well known growth factors in wound healing.

the effects of insulin on keratinocyte migration described above, led us to hypothesize that insulin-accelerated wound healing involves increased expression of the integrin α3β <dig> in keratinocytes as well as an increase in the levels of ln <dig>  the latter protein is a matrix molecule secreted by migrating keratinocytes at the leading edge  <cit> , where it mediates keratinocyte polarity and persistent migration  <cit> . after wounding, quiescent epidermal keratinocytes are activated and express the integrins α6β <dig> and α3β <dig>  which mediate their migration on ln <dig> and facilitate the development of the bm  <cit> . our results show that insulin stimulates keratinocyte integrin α <dig> expression and ln <dig> deposition, and that inhibition of these proteins in vitro or in vivo inhibits insulin-induced keratinocyte migration and wound healing, strongly suggesting an important role for these molecules in insulin stimulation of healing. this is a particularly important finding, as the relationship between ln <dig> and migration has been controversial. indeed, previous studies have implicated ln <dig> in promoting and inhibiting cell migration  <cit> ; our results support a role for ln <dig> in promoting keratinocyte migration.

in addition to its effects on keratinocyte migration during wound healing, insulin also promotes attachment of the epidermis to the dermis, the appearance of a well-organized epidermis, increased numbers of skin appendages, and more dermal papilla and epidermal reticular ridges. we also found that inhibiting integrin α <dig> and ln <dig> resulted in lack of full epidermal differentiation  and decreased formation of dermal papilla and epidermal reticular ridges.

our results suggest that the direct application of insulin to chronic wounds may improve wound healing by compensating for a deficiency of insulin and/or igf- <dig> in the injured area. previous studies have shown that the igf- <dig> level is decreased in both streptozotocin -induced diabetic and normal rat incision wounds  <cit> , and we have also detected a decrease in insulin levels in rat scald wounds . this insulin and igf- <dig> deficiency in the wound, along with our data showing that insulin can function through stimulation of both insulin and igf- <dig> receptors, suggests that direct application of insulin to the wound area may improve healing through activation of both receptors. indeed, it has been shown that topical application of insulin accelerates healing of infected cutaneous ulcerations in diabetic mice  <cit> , showing that insulin is promising for treatment of these types of wounds. however, it has also been shown that leptin-deficient obese/obese  diabetic mice have dysfunctional signaling during wound healing  <cit> , suggesting that in these mice mediating the effect of insulin on wounds might be different from those in normal wounds or wounds in diabetic people.

when compared with other growth factors used to promote wound repair, insulin treatment is likely to be much less expensive, more readily available, and has already been approved by the fda for human use. moreover, a significant numbers of reports have described that treatment with growth factors, including most of the growth factors that have been used clinically, or increased expression of growth factor receptors, lead to carcinogenesis  <cit> . in contrast, insulin is safe, as shown by its use for nearly a hundred years, hence it is likely safer than growth factor alternatives. when choosing a concentration of insulin for possible wound therapy, it is important to remember that, although the highest concentrations of insulin resulted in the greatest keratinocyte migration, such doses may alter blood glucose levels in vivo.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have shown that insulin interacts with its receptor and affects multiple aspects of keratinocyte behavior, including stimulation of cell motility, increased expression of the cell surface adhesion molecule integrin α <dig> and enhanced secretion of the ecm molecule ln <dig>  furthermore, these effects extend to the dermis where we observe a higher degree of tissue restoration than seen in the control. these results strongly suggest that insulin improves wound healing through an integrated effect not only on re-epithelialization but also on the underlying granulation tissue. therefore, insulin treatment may prove to be a powerful therapy for the treatment of impaired wounds, especially given the fact that insulin has been used in humans for a century without serious adverse consequences.
