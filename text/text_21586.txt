BACKGROUND
potassium channels are well-established biological targets for diseases including neuropathic pain, epilepsy, cardiac arrhythmia, hearing loss, deafness, or tinnitus
 <cit> . in particular, mutations in the kcnq <dig> potassium gene and perhaps kcnq <dig> are associated with progressive high frequency hearing loss
 <cit> . of the several ion channels used by the sensory hair cell, the k+ channel kcnq <dig> is thought to modulate the membrane potential of hair cells to adjust the sensitivity of hearing in a variety of mammals
 <cit> . similarly, kcnq <dig> and kcnq <dig> are key modulators of l-type ca2+ channel activity in cardiovascular cells
 <cit> . variants of kcnq <dig> are not associated with sensory hearing loss in humans, but there is high abundance in the larval zebrafish ear
 <cit> , and thus, may be related to yet to be defined developmental factors related to hearing
 <cit> .

a recent study characterized the expression of kcnq <dig>  kcnq <dig>  and kcnq <dig> in whole larval zebrafish  <cit> , but we know little about the expression of the complement of kcnq genes and the k+ ion channels that they encode in various organs of the adult zebrafish. since certain drugs and metal ions affect the function of kcnq channels
 <cit>  in a dose-dependent manner, these agents can be used to alter ion permeability across the membrane of zebrafish hair cells and thus create a fish model of sensory cell dysfunction. kcnq2- <dig> channels are also regulated by intracellular signal transduction effectors such as phospholipids
 <cit> , phosphorylation
 <cit> , and calmodulin
 <cit> . however, little is known about how these signaling systems impact the kcnq channels in zebrafish sensory pathways. thus, the zebrafish offers a unique opportunity to study kcnq channel modulation, function and dysfunction.

the zebrafish has served as an especially attractive model for the study of the development and function of the vertebrate inner ear
 <cit> . it has three methods of sensing sound within its environment. the first involves the lateral line system, which is comprised of a set of neuromasts containing hair cells arrayed along each side of the body. neuromasts contain bundles of sensory hair cells beneath a cupula, which are responsible for sensing the displacement of water molecules
 <cit> . the second means of sensing sound are structures of the inner ear composed of the utricle, saccule, lagena and pars neglecta. each of these anatomical structures house patches of sensory hair cells and supporting cells that are embedded in the epithelial lining of the macula
 <cit> . the hair cells found in these structures are similar to those found in mammals, and contain voltage gated and ligand gated ion channels presumably linked to several signal transduction pathways. third, there are sets of motion detectors or neuromasts arrayed around the head, particularly the orbital regions. in this report, we have studied kcnq channel expression and localization in several tissues of the zebrafish. using the deduced mrna sequences in the available databases, we probed for the presence of kcnq channel mrna transcripts in the ear, brain and heart, and partially characterized the amino acid sequence of one channel protein. the zebrafish genome has two different kcnq <dig> genes, one of which has been localized to chromosome  <dig>  the mrna from this gene is also expressed in zebrafish brain and ear. we prepared a specific antibody to zebrafish kcnq <dig>  quantified its levels using qrt-pcr, and further verified its expression using western blots of brain and ear tissues.

RESULTS
detection of kcnq expression in zebrafish
amplicons representing kcnq1- <dig> were detected by rt-pcr analyses and observed under uv illumination. table 
 <dig> shows the primers, amplicon size, and primer sequences used for all pcr reactions. primers and nested primers were designed to cross several exons of the specific pcr template sequence.

several of the kcnq rna transcripts were expressed in the zebrafish brain  consistent with observations in other species
 <cit> . kcnq <dig> and kcnq <dig> were absent in the gel , but were detected in the quantitative data , at the same approximate levels. the pcr data for kcnq <dig> were done with kcnq5b primers while the quantitative pcr was done with kcnq5a primers. kcnq <dig> was probed by three different sets of primers  for downstream cdna sequencing. bands for kcnq <dig> for the three sets of primers were readily detected. kcnq <dig> and kcnq <dig> showed the strongest signal, while kcnq <dig> displayed two almost overlapping bands. a negative control  is shown in the last lane. the expression strength of the mrna transcript was compared to the intensity of the β-actin control.

the inner ear tissue of zebrafish included the sensory epithelium , consisting also portions of the utricle, saccule and lagena tissues, but not semicircular canals. figure 
1b shows mrna expression of kcnq1- <dig> in the zebrafish ear - all kcnq transcripts were detected. however, kcnq <dig> was somewhat weak, while kcnq5b provided a much stronger signal. figure 
1c shows the expression pattern in zebrafish heart. except for kcnq5b, transcripts for kcnq1- <dig> were detected.

as mentioned in the introduction, the partial sequence of a kcnq <dig> gene has also been mapped to chromosome  <dig>  we detected expression of transcripts based upon this gene in brain and ear  and the heart . the sequence is located at the 5′ end  of the transcript encoding a  <dig> amino acid sequence, homologous to kcnq <dig> from human as well as other species . using various combinations of primers in the rt-pcr experiments, all attempts to link sequences of the chromosome  <dig> transcripts to the more 3′ kcnq <dig> sequences in our mrna, which is not yet mapped to a chromosome, failed to show up in our data . therefore, we conclude from these observations that there are two separate kcnq <dig> genes expressed in the zebrafish.

qrtpcr of kcnq1- <dig> expression in brain, ear, or heart
end point pcr is not applicable to quantitative measures of expression, and detection of bands can be variable using electrophoretic separation. therefore, we performed qrtpcr using reverse-transcribed mrna templates from each tissue. different primers were designed to produce amplicons  suitable for sybr green-based real time quantitative analysis . as shown in figure 
 <dig>  the brain has very high expression of kcnq <dig> and kcnq <dig> compared to other tissues. kcnq2- <dig> transcripts are lower than kcnq <dig> in the heart, while kcnq5a is particularly elevated in the ear, when compared to the brain.

kcnq <dig> protein expression using western blots
to further verify the presence of kcnq <dig> protein, we probed western blots of ear  and brain  tissue with rabbit polyclonal antipeptide antisera. a major band at ~80 kda corresponding to the size of kcnq <dig> in mammalian species was readily detected in ear, and brain tissue extracts. the band was absent  when the immunizing peptide was present along with the primary antibody. pre-immune sera from the rabbit showed no reactivity to proteins in zebrafish brain or ear tissue extracts . using appropriately designed primers, we also performed dna sequencing on the kcnq <dig> pcr products that are summarized in table 
 <dig>  the sequenced data maps to various zebrafish genomic clones, and the translation of the mrna provide amino acid sequences consistent with kcnq <dig> , indicating that the clones represent active transcripts of a kcnq <dig> protein.

genetic and comparative analysis of kcnq <dig> proteins 
we checked the putative kcnq <dig> cdna sequence against the zebrafish genome assembly and clones by blast searching. we retrieved the sequences of two genomic clones that contained kcnq <dig> sequences . using two exon prediction programs, net2gene
 <cit>  and hmm
 <cit> , we generated a mrna sequence comparable to the genbank sequence, except that the 300 bp of 5′ end and the 200 bp of 3′ end sequence were not found. in the genomic clones, nw_ <dig> contains three exons, while the scaffold zv9_na546: <dig>  520- <dig>  contains  <dig> exons. we originally analyzed an earlier sequence deposited in genbank  that contains the same exons as the scaffold zv9_na546:  <dig> - <dig> . two cryptic exons in nw_ <dig> detected by the exon predictions programs are not used in the zebrafish kcnq <dig>  moreover, orfs within these two cryptic exons do not contain amino acid sequences related to the kcnq family of channels. for comparison, the exon structure of the partial kcnq <dig> gene from chromosome  <dig> is shown in figure 
6b. our pcr data confirmed that the transcript contains a sequence from the three exons in this partial gene.

the derived coding sequence from the  <dig> exons of nw_001881069 + zv9_na546:  <dig>  520- <dig>  matches very well to other kcnq <dig> amino acid sequences from chimpanzee, frog, and humans . similarly, the translation of the 5′ mrna from chromosome  <dig> kcnq <dig> is also very well conserved in the same species . table 
 <dig> summarizes all of the known kcnq genes in zebrafish as of january  <dig>  ensembl ids are used for the gene, mrna, and translated protein sequences, as these are referenced directly in the zfin database. cross-references to entries in genbank and uniprot are also tabulated. kcnq <dig> on chromosome  <dig> has three potential splice products of differing lengths that have not been fully characterized. kcnq <dig> also has another gene identified on chromosome  <dig>  but no transcripts have yet to be reported. kcnq <dig> has two genes, one on chromosome  <dig> that we also detected in this work, and another on chromosome  <dig> that was detected in zebrafish larvae
 <cit> . kcnq <dig> has also two genes, and in this paper, we focused mostly on transcripts derived from chromosome  <dig> . the chromosome  <dig> derived kcnq5b has also been detected in zebrafish larvae
 <cit> .

discussion
in this study, we characterized kcnq-type proteins/channel expression in brain, heart, and ear tissues of the zebrafish. we show that members of the kcnq  family of mrnas are present in these tissues. further, we demonstrated mrna as well as the protein for kcnq <dig> in ear and brain extracts from adult zebrafish. although signals for kcnq <dig> and kcnq <dig> were weak using end-point pcr, the transcripts were readily detected in all tissues using qrtpcr. these data are consistent with previous reports of the kcnq <dig> channel expressed during development
 <cit> .

as previously found in mammals
 <cit> , kcnq <dig> was expressed in zebrafish brain, heart and ear. similarly, in mammals, kcnq <dig> is usually found co-expressed in the same tissues. kcnq <dig> was detected in ear and brain tissue using a kcnq <dig> selective antibody. kcnq <dig> is found in auditory hair cells in mammals and we suggest that it may be present in homologous cells in the zebrafish.

the amino acid sequences of zebrafish kcnq <dig>  as well as other members of the kcnq channel family, are conserved across phylogeny
 <cit> . one distinguishing characteristic of kcnq <dig> and kcnq <dig> is the presence of a clustering domain that allows interaction of kcnq channels with na+ channels in the nodes of ranvier
 <cit> . another characteristic of kcnq channels is that the structural assembly  is dependent upon amino acid sequences in the carboxyl-terminal region
 <cit> . in the case of zebrafish kcnq <dig>  the translated amino acid sequence that we derived  is consistent with the head-linker-tail structure of kcnq <dig> that supports a homotetrameric structure
 <cit> .

the more highly abundant kcnq transcripts expressed in the brain  are possible contributors to a number of important electrophysiological functions that are necessary for normal cognitive function. that is, dysfunction of these channels has been associated with dementia, stroke, and epilepsy
 <cit> . very similar to the mammalian cochlea
 <cit> , but perhaps more similar to the vestibular system
 <cit> , our results show that the zebrafish inner ear sensory tissues do express the kcnq2- <dig> genes. the inhibition of kcnq <dig> activity in the mammalian cochlea
 <cit>  or knockout mouse
 <cit>  causes sensory cell degeneration followed by deafness. however, unlike mammals, the zebrafish hair cells are capable of regeneration after acoustic or chemical insult
 <cit> , and selected transcription factors among other putative molecules are key mediators of the regeneration
 <cit> . no variants of kcnq <dig> are associated with sensory hearing loss in humans so perhaps its high abundance in the zebrafish ear is associated with regenerative capabilities.

studies of the effects of exogenous regulators of zebrafish hair cell regeneration are at various stages of investigation
 <cit> . our identification of kcnq channels in zebrafish may offer a new in vivo model system for screening kcnq channel modulators/drugs and their effects on regeneration. certain classes of drugs are being designed to modulate the activity of specific kcnq-type channels
 <cit> , and our work suggests that screening this class of chemotherapeutic agents for functional
 <cit> , as well as for adverse effects  in the zebrafish is promising. further, expression of the channels cloned from the zebrafish in heterologous systems
 <cit>  provides an attractive platform for electrophysiological studies since dissociated hair cells from the inner ear of the zebrafish are extremely difficult to patch .

CONCLUSIONS
recent advances in sequencing the zebrafish genome have provided further insight into modeling human diseases
 <cit> . nevertheless, the chromosomal localizations and/or complete sequencing of the kcnq <dig> gene remain to be completed. western blots demonstrated that the kcnq <dig> protein is expressed in the brain as well as the ear. thus, using the zebrafish with its rapid developmental period as a laboratory specimen may accelerate genetic screening for more specific kcnq channel mutants, and perhaps foster drug discovery strategies for chemotherapeutic intervention in diseases associated with mutations in the kv  family of genes, e.g., conditions manifested in humans such as hearing loss, and tinnitus.
