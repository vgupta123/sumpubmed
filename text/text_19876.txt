BACKGROUND
living organisms including fungi sense and respond to various environmental stresses. responses to these stresses can be associated with morphological and chemical differentiation, including sporulation and secondary metabolite production in filamentous fungi
 <cit> . several studies have correlated the synthesis of specific metabolites and spore development with oxidative stress
. one system known to coordinate sporulation and development and, more recently oxidative stress, is the heterotrimeric transcriptional regulator known as the velvet complex
 <cit> .

the best-described members of the velvet complex are the methyltransferase laea  and the scaffold protein vea . as both proteins regulate a substantial proportion of the fungal genome
, efforts have been focused on characterizing laea and vea signaling pathways with the goal of thoroughly understanding regulation of either secondary metabolism or differentiation processes in fungi. consistent with the broad regulation of the transcriptome by the velvet complex, laea and vea regulate other aspects of fungal development including the oxidative stress response
. efforts in understanding how laea and vea regulate so many processes in fungal development have centered on identifying mutations that are able to restore a phenotype of interest in these deletion mutants . restoration of sterigmatocystin, a highly produced secondary metabolite in a. nidulans regulated by both laea and vea, is often used for screening purposes
 <cit> .

mutations arising from chemical mutagenesis screens, in particular, are both costly and time-consuming to identify through standard dna library complementation. recently next generation sequencing methods have been successfully applied to identify mutant genes in a number of major model organisms
 <cit>  and advances in these technologies have significantly reduced cost, while making this approach accessible for other genetically tractable systems, including fungal organisms such as sordaria macrospora
 <cit> . here we describe our identification of a c2h <dig> transcription factor, termed rsra, using illumina technology to interrogate a mutant arising from a 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide  screen of a Δlaea mutant.

although loss of rsra corroborated the original mutation , the primary impact of rsra loss was on resistance to oxidative stress and reduced reproductive development. the rsra allele is located in a syntenic region in the genomes of aspergillus spp. and its function is conserved in a. nidulans, a. flavus and a. fumigatus. in depth exploration of the oxidative stress metabolome in a. nidulans supports a model where rsra governs fungal response to reactive oxygen species  through the conserved bzip transcription factor napa and its downstream targets.

RESULTS
ilumina sequence analysis leads to identification of a. nidulans rsra
mutagenesis of a ΔlaeaΔstcevea <dig> strain, rjw <dig> , led to identification of one mutant, mgg <dig> , in which norsolorinic acid was restored to greater than wild-type levels . norsolorinic acid , which accumulates when stce is deleted, is a visible precursor to sterigmatocystin and used as a convenient screen for identifying mutations affecting sterigmatocystin biosynthesis
 <cit> . five backcrosses to mgg <dig>  were made in efforts to minimize snps. two progenies  carrying the same secondary metabolite phenotype as the original mutant  were sequenced using illumina technology. based on snp analysis, we identified  <dig> genes with coding region polymorphisms associated with the mgg <dig>  mutant. further culling through two more sexual crosses generating rjw207a, rjw207b, and rjw207c coupled with pcr-based snp detection enabled us to identify one gene, an <dig>  encoding a putative c2h <dig> zinc finger transcription factor as the primary mgg <dig>  lesion. sequence analysis of an <dig> in mgg <dig>  showed it harbored a c -> t transition at codon  <dig> leading to an early stop codon in the predicted orf.

the wild type an <dig> orf was deleted as determined by southern analysis and examined in both vea and vea <dig> backgrounds  with and without an intact laea gene . as shown in figure 
1a, extracts from these near isogenic strains revealed that loss of an <dig> in the Δlaea background restored sterigmatocystin synthesis, thus supporting the original mutant phenotype. the Δan <dig> strain produced considerably more sterigmatocystin than wild type. we also found that an <dig> loss could partially restore sterigmatocystin in Δvea  and that, dependent on the time point examined, an <dig> was mis-regulated in both Δvea and Δlaea backgrounds .figure  <dig>

despite the impact on sterigmatocystin and its precursors, other secondary metabolites were not greatly impacted in these growth conditions nor did deletion of this gene have a significant effect on secondary metabolism in a. fumigatus and a. flavus . hence, an <dig> was named rsra  for its association with the stress response in aspergilli as detailed below.

rsra is required for both meiotic and mitotic spore development
sterigmatocystin production is coupled with both asexual and sexual sporulation in a. nidulans and therefore we examined both mitotic and meiotic spore production as well as general growth in the Δrsra mutant. the Δrsra strain exhibited a sick growth phenotype, with reduced radial growth; this reduction in radial growth was apparent in all double mutants as well . an examination of conidia and ascospore production showed that rsra loss nearly eliminated production of both spores, regardless of genetic background . complementation of Δrsra with its wild-type allele largely restored phenotypes to that of wild type levels for growth and sporulation patterns; however sterigmatocystin production was only partially restored .figure  <dig>

rsra is a conserved protein affecting development in aspergilli including spore  and sclerotia  production
putative rsra orthologs are located in a highly syntenic region of multiple aspergilli genomes . we thus wondered if the protein might play any similar role in other aspergilli and therefore deleted the putative ortholog in two a. fumigatus strains and one a. flavus strain . a visual examination of the mutants showed a distinct phenotype in the a. flavus mutant and in the cea <dig> ku80Δ but not the af <dig> a. fumigatus background .

as one major impact of rsra loss on a. nidulans was on reproduction development, we assessed asexual sporulation in the a. fumigatus and a. flavus mutants and sclerotia production in the latter species. all three rsra deletion strains were examined for spore production. figure 
3a and b illustrate that similar to a. nidulans, both a. fumigatus and a. flavus Δrsra strains displayed reduced conidia production. additionally, rsra loss greatly reduced sclerotia production in a. flavus . sclerotia are analogous developmental structures to cleistothecia and can house ascospores when opposite mating types of a. flavus are paired
 <cit> . sexual development was not examined in the a. fumigatus strain due to the length of time needed to assess this process in this species

a conserved role for rsra in sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide
as the rsra gene was induced by camptothecin in a study assessing dna damage in a. nidulans
 <cit> , we thought rsra might be involved in a stress response in a. nidulans and possibly other aspergilli. therefore, Δrsra mutants and their wild type controls were assessed for response to a variety of challenges including exposure to hydrogen peroxide , tert-butyl hydroperoxide , camptothecin, alkaline ph, sodium chloride, sorbitol and congo red .figure  <dig>

a conserved response was observed to hydrogen peroxide challenge where all four Δrsra mutants – although not the 6th backcross progeny mutant rjw207b  possibly due to containing vea <dig> and Δlaea alleles - grew better than wild type . supporting the results from the growth assay on hydrogen peroxide, a hydrogen peroxide diffusion assay showed a reduced zone of growth inhibition in the Δrsra mutants compared to the respective wild type strains of a. nidulans, a. fumigatus and a. flavus . additionally, in the zones of growth inhibition an increased formation of air bubbles was observed in the Δrsra mutants compared to the respective wild types of all the aspergilli . fungi produce catalases in order to detoxify hydrogen peroxide into molecular oxygen and water
 <cit> , thereby forming oxygen air bubbles in the solidified agar as shown in figure 
5b. addition of increasing concentrations of the reducing agent glutathione  decreased air bubble formation in all strains, but the formation was still more apparent in the Δrsra strains compared to their respective wild types.figure  <dig>

rsra regulates critical stress transcriptional pathways in a. nidulans
considering that the conserved phenotypes of the rsra mutants in the three aspergillus spp. examined center around hydrogen peroxide resistance and development , we set out to examine a possible role for rsra in ros biology. therefore, we assessed expression of genes associated with resistance to ros in a. nidulans. this included transcriptional regulators napa and atfa  and members of the ccaat-binding factor ancf  as well as components of the thioredoxin system , the glutathione system , and two representative detoxification enzymes catb  and soda .

as shown in figure 
 <dig>  many of these genes were highly up-regulated when Δrsra was exposed to hydrogen peroxide. napa was several fold up-regulated as were several napa target genes in thioredoxin and gluthathione metabolism  but not napa targets catb and soda. atfa was also up-regulated although transcripts of saka encoding the atfa mapk interacting partner appeared not to be affected by rsra loss
 <cit> . of the ancf subunits, only hapc was upregulated in Δrsra.figure  <dig>

rsra coordinates ros response through napa
the transcriptional data suggested a possible role for napa or atfa in mediation of the rsra ros affects. to elucidate such a possibility, we next made double mutants of Δnapa and Δatfa with Δrsra and assessed the double mutants to their respective controls for growth on hydrogen peroxide and tbooh . the double mutant ΔatfaΔrsra but not ΔnapaΔrsra demonstrated an enhanced resistance to both oxidative stressors, thus indicative of napa as the primary conduit of rsra integration to ros regulation.figure  <dig>

discussion
whole-genome sequencing is now a feasible method to identify mutations associated with a desired phenotype
 <cit> . in aspergillus spp. and other fungi, single gene mutations have been typically identified through meiotic mapping and/or complementation with dna libraries
 <cit> . this is an arduous procedure requiring a significant amount of time and effort that does not always meet with success. given the relatively small genome size of model fungi coupled with the decreasing costs of dna sequencing, we thought it feasible to utilize illumina whole genome sequence to identify an a. nidulans mutation, obviating the need for prior characterization of informative markers. we utilized the sequenced strain of this species, employing a chemical mutagen to generate the mutation of interest, which we then backcrossed to reduce the number of snps to investigate. this approach was successful, identifying a small and tractable number of candidate mutations to test, revealing rsra as a conserved protein regulating the oxidative stress response and reproductive development in aspergilli.

rsra encodes a putative c2h <dig> zinc finger transcription factor. c2h <dig> proteins are conserved in eukaryotes, falling into an estimated  <dig> gene families
 <cit> . a. nidulans contains  <dig> such proteins in its genome
 <cit> . the two primary phenotypes of rsra loss, decrease in sporulation and enhanced resistance to oxidative stress, were conserved in the three species examined. deletions in all species resulted in significant decrease in asexual spores as well as sexual structures/spores in a. nidulans and a. flavus . considering the many studies linking sporulation and ros
 <cit> , these aberrancies in development may be genetically linked with the altered oxidative stress response in the Δrsra background.

the oxidative stress response in fungi has been the topic of many studies due to the importance of this pathway in several aspects of fungal biology. maintaining a mechanism to detoxify ros is critical for all forms of aerobic life and ros are mediators of cell signaling processes governing differentiation processes. hence studies have been directed at understanding the processes regulating this response in fungi including aspergillus. here we sought to place rsra in the context of known ros pathways. transcriptional regulation of the oxidative response pathway is mediated by two well-known bzip proteins, napa  and atfa, and the ccaat binding complex ancf. rsra acts as a repressor of both bzip genes and one subunit of the ancf complex during hydrogen peroxide treatment . however, considering that hapb and hape transcripts were not affected in Δrsra and that hapc would be oxidized by h2o <dig> and thus inactive, ancf is unlikely a mediator of rsra regulation of the oxidative stress response.

of the two bzip proteins, our accumulative data suggests napa and not atfa to be the prime conduit of rsra signaling . napa is directly activated by oxidation through ros, allowing it to enter the nucleus and exert its role as a positive transcription factor. previous studies in aspergillus spp. have supported a role for napa in positively regulating both non-enzymatic  and enzymatic pathways  important in protection against ros
. although catb and soda were not greatly – if at all – affected by rsra loss, all members of the thioredoxin and gluthathione metabolism, excluding gsta, were highly upregulated during h2o <dig> treatment of Δrsra. glra  and gpxa  are key components of the glutathione/glutathione disulfide  cycle in fungi
 <cit>  whereas gsta  transfers gsh to xenobiotic substrates for detoxification
 <cit> . thus the differential response of these three genes may implicate rsra in balancing the gss/gssh ratios, at least during ros stress. assessment of ros sensitivity of the double mutants support a major role for napa in regulating ros detoxification mechanism  and clearly place rsra in epistatic relationship with napa. by induction of genes involved in ros detoxification, napa is the activator of an intrinsic negative feedback loop counteracting oxidative stress and hence its own deactivation by reduction
 <cit> .figure  <dig> 
model integrating rsra into the global ros-responsive network in
a. nidulans. upon hydrogen peroxide exposure, the bzip transcription factor napa gets directly oxidized and thereby activates gene expression of enzymes and components  involved in balancing the redox status of the cells. rsra acts as a repressor of certain napa-activated target genes, perhaps in balance with the ancf complex. how rsra is activated itself remains unclear.



our collective data suggest that deletion of rsra results in increased tolerance towards hydrogen peroxide stress, possibly due to increased expression levels of genes involved in gsh and thioredoxin production  as well as increased catalase activity . this increased activation is most likely through napa . as an increased arsenal of reducing agents  would result in inactivation of napa in the wild type
 <cit> , rsra loss somehow leads to an active form of napa that results in increased target gene expression even when ros stress is counteracted. therefore we suggest that rsra could be a negative transcriptional element in the global regulatory network of oxidative stress response, perhaps in balance with the ancf complex .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have successfully identified the putative c2h <dig> protein rsra using state of the art whole genome sequencing methodologies. rsra is negative regulator of the oxidative response cascade acting primarily through inhibition of napa and napa target activities.
