BACKGROUND
flax  is a self-pollinated annual species  belonging to the linaceae family. it has been utilised by mankind for some  <dig>  years   <cit> , was domesticated ~ <dig>  years ago in the near east and then spread to the fertile crescent where it was grown for its seed oil and stem fibres  <cit> . currently, canada is the world’s largest producer of linseed .

flax oil is highly sought after in the fabrication of biodegradable products such as paint, linoleum and varnish, while its oil-free meal is used as livestock feed. recently, linseed has gained importance as nutraceutical primarily because of its α-linolenic acid  and lignan content. the ala component of flax oil  improves bone and cardio-vascular health  <cit>  while lignans are a rich source of antioxidants and precursors of various hormones  <cit> . animal feed for cattle and chicken is being fortified with flax to produce omega- <dig> enriched meat and eggs  <cit> .

to assess and capitalize upon the genetic variability in flax, genomic resources are needed. the flax genome assembled from short shotgun reads  <cit>  as well as a collection of expressed sequence tags  from more than  <dig> different tissue libraries are now available  <cit> . genetic mapping remains a commonly used approach to understand the molecular basis of phenotypic traits. various molecular markers including random amplified polymorphic dna , restriction fragment length polymorphism , amplified fragment length polymorphism  and simple sequence repeat  have been developed to analyse flax genetic diversity  <cit> . three bi-parental population-based linkage maps of flax have been published to date: an aflp map of  <dig> markers  <cit> , an rflp and rapd map of  <dig> markers  <cit>  and an ssr map of  <dig> markers  <cit> . a recently constructed  <dig> ssr consensus map based on three populations constitutes a significant improvement over previous maps but even this marker density remains insufficient for many applications  <cit> . an ideal molecular approach to generate markers is one that assesses numerous reliable markers covering the entire genome in a single and simple experiment  <cit> . the discovery of single nucleotide polymorphic  markers combined with next generation sequencing  permits the identification of thousands of markers from entire genomes which can be used for linkage map construction, genetic diversity analyses, marker-trait association and marker-assisted selection  <cit> . snps have been discovered by high throughput sequencing in humans  <cit> , drosophila melanogaster <cit> , wheat  <cit> , eggplant  <cit> , rice  <cit> , arabidopsis thaliana <cit> , barley  <cit> , walnut  <cit> , lupin  <cit> , globe artichoke  <cit> , rapeseed  <cit> , perennial ryegrass  <cit>  and maize  <cit>  to name but a few. snp discovery through genome sequencing is readily accomplished in simpler genomes like rice and arabidopsis <cit>  but the task remains challenging for a number of economically important crops  <cit> . the discovery process is also impeded by the presence of repeat elements, paralogous sequences and reference genomes that are incomplete or inaccurate. the flax genome of cdc bethune has an estimated size of ~ <dig> mbp with a high proportion of low copy sequences  <cit> . its repetitive fraction consists of ribosomal dna , known transposable elements  and putative novel repeat elements   <cit>  making it highly suitable for snp discovery.

genomic complexity can be reduced using restriction enzymes  <cit> , high-cot selection  <cit> , methylation filtration  <cit> , microarrays  <cit>  and cdnas  <cit> . trebbi et al. have described the pros and cons of these methods  <cit> . the use of reduced representation libraries  is advantageous because the reduction of genome complexity can be altered by selecting different enzymes or size ranges. rrl sequencing, first proposed for the human genome, reduces genome complexity, facilitates re-sampling and generates sufficient coverage for accurate snp calling  <cit> . deep re-sequencing of rrls using the sequencing-by-synthesis method has been performed for the purpose of snp discovery in soybean and sorghum  <cit> .

snp genotyping of one to several thousands of snps can be performed simultaneously using various chemistries such as taqman® probes  <cit> , invader®  <cit> , iplex®  <cit> , kaspartm <cit> , snapshottm <cit> , goldengate®  <cit>  and infinium® assays  <cit> . the high throughput and constantly decreasing cost of sequencing technologies makes genotyping-by-sequencing  an attractive choice for genome-wide snp genotyping.

the objective of the current study was to discover and validate snps in flax using a combined ngs of rrls and gbs strategy with the updated annotation based genome-wide snp discovery pipeline   <cit> . the resource promises to have several downstream applications including the exploitation of flax genetic diversity through the understanding of important phenotypic traits.

RESULTS
selection of genotypes, sequencing and sequence alignment
flax genotypes cdc bethune, macbeth, sp <dig> and ugg5- <dig> were selected because they are parents of mapping populations. atlas, double low, g-1186/ <dig> and crepitam tabor were chosen from a core collection of flax lines because they were genetically diverse according to our previous assessment based on several hundred ssr markers  <cit> . the broader genetic diversity of these lines minimizes potential biases caused by breeding selection which could decrease the usefulness of snps in association mapping  <cit> .

all sequencing was performed on the illumina platform. advances in sequencing technology through the duration of the project led to reads ranging in length from  <dig> to  <dig> bp, thus resulting in variation in the number of paired end tag  reads and in sequence coverage among the eight genotypes . the data was deposited in the sort read archive of ncbi under accession number sra <dig>  the snp discovery procedure is illustrated in figure  <dig> 

read mapping was performed against the whole genome shotgun sequence assembly  of cdc bethune using bwa.

a average mapped read depth was based on a fitted extreme value distribution of mapped read depth in a bin width of  <dig> kbp sequence.

b the average mapping coverage percentage was estimated based on the cdc bethune reference genome sequence length of  <dig> mbp .

bowtie  <cit>  and bwa algorithms  <cit>  were used to map illumina reads from the eight genotypes to the cdc bethune whole genome shotgun  sequence assembly   <cit> , hereafter referred to as the ‘reference sequence’. for cdc bethune illumina pet reads, the bowtie algorithm mapped approximately  <dig> % of the reads to the reference sequence,  <dig> % of the reads were supressed due to more than one reported mapping location and  <dig> % of the reads remained unmapped . overall,  <dig> % of the reads from the eight genotypes mapped to the reference sequence using bowtie . using bwa, the  <dig>  million cdc bethune reads resulted in  <dig>  million mapped reads  with  <dig>  million remaining unmapped  , thus showing the highest percentage of mapped reads as was expected because the reference sequence was obtained from this genotype. out of  <dig> million combined reads from the eight genotypes, the bwa algorithm mapped approximately  <dig> million reads  and  <dig> million reads  remained unmapped . the percentage of mapped reads ranged from ~ <dig> % to 93% depending on the genotypes. the maximum sequence coverage was obtained from g-1186/ <dig> followed by atlas with 16x and 15x, respectively .

the distribution of the mapping coverage percentage  and the mapped read depth  in bins of  <dig>  mbp over the entire length of the concatenated reference sequence is shown as heat maps in figures 2a and 2b, respectively. pet reads from rrl sequences were distributed throughout the concatenated reference sequence, except for the tail end regions that consisted of short sequence contigs less than 200bp in length. a significant positive correlation  between mcp and sequence coverage was observed . however, the mrd remained relatively unchanged with an increase in sequence coverage, showing no significant correlation between mrd and sequence coverage .

snp discovery and characterization
the alignment file generated by bwa was used as input for snp discovery using samtools  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  putative snps with a quality score ≥  <dig> were identified and processed through the modified agsnp pipeline  <cit> . after applying the stringent snp filtering criteria described in table  <dig>  a total of  <dig>  snps were retained. the majority of the snps  from the seven contrasting genotypes were represented by read depths of ≤  <dig> and 10% were discovered in regions with total read depths between  <dig> and  <dig> . sequencing and/or mapping errors  were estimated by counting the single nucleotide mismatches generated by mapping the cdc bethune pet reads onto the reference sequence. a false positive rate of  <dig> ×10- <dig> per nucleotide of the reference sequence  was obtained using bwa and samtools. 

ax¯ + 2s is the average read depth and standard deviation estimated based on the fitted extreme value distribution for each genotype separately.

the largest number of snps was identified from crepitam tabor  followed in decreasing order by atlas, g-1186/ <dig>  double low, macbeth, ugg5- <dig> and sp <dig> . the snp counts and sequence coverage were significantly positively correlated . based on the gene prediction database  for the reference sequence, we found that a quarter of the snps were present in genic regions , of which  <dig>   were present in the coding regions . the average rate of snp discovery was one snp per  <dig>  bp for genic regions, one snp per  <dig>  bp for intergenic regions and one snp per  <dig>  bp for the entire genomic regions . close to 84% of the snps  were detected in a single genotype as compared to the reference sequence with the remaining 16%  called in two to seven genotypes . the distribution of snps in bins of  <dig>  mbp showed that the snps were distributed throughout the reference genome with the exception of the small contigs as was observed for mcp and mrd . high snp density across the genome and spots of very high snp density can be visualised on the heat maps of crepitam tabor and atlas which had the most snps.

classification of snps based on base changes included  <dig>   transitions and  <dig>   transversions with a transition to transversion ratio of  <dig>  . an approximately equal number of a/g and c/t transitions were observed while g/t and a/c transversions slightly exceeded a/t and c/g transversions.

validation of flax snps
in order to validate the snps, we used  <dig>  snps identified between cdc bethune and macbeth , and snp data from the gbs of the  <dig> f6-derived rils obtained from a cross between the same two genotypes. the 100bp pet reads of the rils were mapped to the reference sequence and snps called using the same pipeline and criteria . a total of  <dig>  snps out of  <dig>  snp locations were considered for validation because these locations had mapped reads from the individuals of the ril population that met the criteria for true and false snps described below.

snp locations with reads from  <dig> or more rils  that did not show segregation constituted non-validated snps. snp locations with reads from the ril population that segregated for the snps previously identified between cdc bethune and macbeth constituted validated snps. a total of  <dig>  snps  were thus validated and  <dig> snps remained non-validated.

discussion
the current study was undertaken to discover snps using flax genotypes that were parents of mapping populations and/or of diverse genetic backgrounds. the illumina platform was chosen to sequence the rrls because of its throughput, relatively low cost, indexing and pet capabilities.

the mapping of sequence reads was performed with bowtie and bwa using their default settings on the same linux based servers. wang and colleagues suggested using bowtie or bwa for fast and efficient alignment of illumina short reads  <cit> . the current study found bwa to be superior to bowtie at mapping short reads. a higher percentage of read mapping was achieved using bwa  compared to bowtie  when illumina reads of eight genotypes were mapped onto the reference sequence . since most of the critical parameters between bowtie and bwa are identical or similar, we hypothesize that the read mapping differences are likely the results of the inability of bowtie to deal with gapped alignment, a feature incorporated in bwa. the bwa based assembly was chosen for downstream analysis because it produced higher percentages of mapped reads. however, not all but approximately 93% of the cdc bethune reads mapped to the reference sequence which is also from cdc bethune. inaccuracies in the reference genome assembly, sequencing errors and incomplete reference genome sequences may have contributed to the non- or mis-alignment of reads affecting the mapping percentage  <cit> .

the agsnp pipeline was initially designed for large-scale genome-wide snp discovery in large and complex genomes using next generation sequences of two homozygous lines  <cit> . this pipeline was successfully used for snp discovery between two inbred lines in aegilops tauschii . half a million snps with a validation rate of  <dig> % were discovered  <cit> . in the current study, we further updated the pipeline to simultaneously process illumina reads from eight genotypes. a total of  <dig>  snps were discovered with sequence data corresponding to coverage of  <dig> - <dig> x genome equivalents. a snp validation rate of  <dig> % indicated that the agsnp pipeline is a high-throughput snp discovery tool that can be applied to snp discovery in two or more genotypes from low to high complexity genomes. the updated agsnp pipeline is available at http://avena.pw.usda.gov/wheatd/agsnp.shtml.

the rrl approach was successfully adopted in various snp studies  <cit> , however, there is little information available regarding the genomic distribution of mapped reads from these studies. our study demonstrates that the sequencing of rrls generates reads that were distributed throughout the concatenated reference assembly making these libraries suitable for ‘genome-wide’ snp discovery and their downstream mapping applications . increasing the sequence coverage  did not increase the mapped read depth but significantly improved the mapping coverage percentage, eventually resulting in more snps discovered . the lack of sequences pertaining to a specific part of the concatenated assembly may also be due to the exclusion of genomic regions from the restriction digest by msei. to confirm the genome-wide distribution of the snps discovered in our study, we estimated the snps distribution in  <dig>  mbp bins and found that the snps were well distributed throughout the concatenated reference sequence assembly .

advances in next generation sequencing are constantly reducing the cost and increasing both the length and throughput of sequencing to the point where gbs has become possible for a large number of genotypes such as core collections or segregating populations as well as complex genomes. the use of the rrl approach has enhanced read usefulness and assisted in addressing some of the computational challenges for alignment onto a reference sequence.

in our study,  <dig> %  of the snps could not be validated and were considered false-positive. the false-positive snps from non-repetitive regions could result from gene family or duplicate genes which can cause mis-mapping of reads. validation failure could also be due to errors of the wgs sequence assembly or sequencing errors of the macbeth reads. by using next generation sequencing, the current study discovered a significant number of flax snps with a high validation rate achieved through gbs, which was revealed to be an effective method for large scale snp validation when used in conjunction with a segregating population. the rrl coupled with gbs approach has been effective in maize, a large genome species of  <dig>  gbp, and barley where snp validation rates of 91% and 99% were achieved, respectively  <cit> .

the current study estimated the rate of snp discovery in flax to be  <dig>  snps per kbp across the eight genotypes sequenced. this is lower than potato   <cit> , maize   <cit> , globe artichoke   <cit> , rapeseed   <cit>  and grapevine   <cit>  but is similar to that found in tomato   <cit>  and sweet pepper   <cit> . the lower snp rate may reflect the low sequence coverage  in four of the eight genotypes used or the fact that fewer genotypes were used in the current study compared to other species. the snp discovery in genic sequences was four fold less than intergenic regions possibly because the intergenic regions evolve faster and accumulate higher polymorphism compared to the conserved genic regions  <cit> . snps from the intergenic regions can, however, also be functional because some non-coding regions harbour regulatory elements like the vegetative to generative transition  <dig>  in maize that are crucial for flowering  <cit> . in addition, those intergenic snps are useful for the construction of high density snp maps. the high transition/transversion ratio of  <dig>  observed in the current study may be an indication of low genetic divergence  <cit>  which can be an outcome of the self-pollinated nature of flax.

CONCLUSIONS
combined rrl and next generation illumina sequencing were successfully applied for the large-scale discovery of ~55k flax snps that were well distributed throughout the genome. the ever decreasing cost of next generation sequencing combined with an ability to index multiple lines per lane enabled validation of a large number of snps  with a validation rate of  <dig> % using gbs of a segregating population, proving this strategy to be powerful for validation purposes. these snps will be applied in genetic mapping, anchoring of genetic maps with wgs sequence assembly, marker-assisted selection, association mapping and phylogenetic analysis and, as such, they will constitute an important genomic resource for flax studies.
