BACKGROUND
it has been known for a long time that small peptides act as endocrinal hormones and neurotransmitters to facilitate intercellular communications in animals  <cit> . in plants since the first peptide hormone, systemin, is discovered twenty years ago  <cit> , many small peptides have been identified, regulating developmental and defense processes including pollen tube guidance  <cit> , microspore-tapetum interaction  <cit> , stomata patterning  <cit> , cell proliferation  <cit> , stem cell homeostasis  <cit>  and wounding responses  <cit> .

clv <dig> is one of the well-studied peptide hormones in plants. the clv <dig> gene encodes a 96-aa secretory protein that functions in a feedback regulation loop to restrict the number of stem cells in sams by repressing the expression of the wuschel  transcription factor  <cit> . combined genetic and biochemical analyses show that clv <dig> acts through interacting with leucine-rich repeat  receptor kinases of clavata <dig>  and receptor protein kinase  <dig> , a clavata <dig>  receptor-like protein, and a membrane-bound suppressor of llp <dig>  <dig> /coryne  protein  <cit> . clv <dig> shares a conserved 14-aa cle motif with a large number of cle proteins  <cit> . domain deletion analyses reveal that most of the non-conserved sequence located between the secretion signal peptide and the cle motif, and the sequence after the cle motif are not required for the clv <dig> function in vivo <cit> . in vitro experiments show that synthetic 12-, 13- and 14-aa peptides, namely clv3p <dig>  clv3p <dig> and clv3p <dig>  corresponding to the cle motif are functional in promoting stem cell differentiation in both shoot and root meristems   <cit> . direct interaction between clv3p <dig> and clv <dig> has been demonstrated in tobacco by- <dig> cells  <cit> . maldi-tof ms analyses of transgenic calli over-expressing clv <dig> identified a 12-aa hydroxylated peptide  <cit> , while more recently nano-lc-ms analyses of arabidopsis seedlings over-expressing clv <dig> identified a 13-aa arabinose-glycosylated peptide  <cit> . these two candidate endogenous clv <dig> peptides share the same n-terminal arg <dig>  and hydroxylation modifications on pro <dig> and pro <dig>  although ala-substitution experiments showed that the glycosylation on pro <dig> is not required for clv <dig> functions in sams  <cit> , analyses of chemically synthesized clv <dig> glycopeptides indicate that the glycosylation may contribute to the stability of the peptide  <cit> . using a heterologously produced gst-tagged clv <dig> fusion protein in combination with extracts of cauliflower and tobacco by- <dig> cells, two cleavage sites, one before met <dig> and one before arg <dig>  are detected by gel blot and ms analyses  <cit> . for nematode grcle <dig>  cleavages before arg <dig>  arg <dig>  arg <dig> and arg <dig> have been observed using cauliflower and potato root extracts  <cit> . in medicago truncatula, it has been shown that mtcle <dig> is processed by enzymes in extracellular fluids, producing a 15-aa peptide, skrrvpngpdpihnr  <cit> . although these studies provide basic knowledge on the cleavage of cle peptides, sequences involved in the cleavage recognition and how such cleavages contribute to the activity of these peptides remain elusive.

in animals, enzymes involved in peptide cleavages are serine endopeptidase sub-family subtilases , also known as subtilisin-like proprotein convertases  <cit> . the cleavage generally occurs between or after dibasic lys/arg-arg residues, or after the monobasic residue arg, releasing peptides with n- and/or c-terminal basic residues  <cit> . these basic residues are then removed by exopeptidases such as carboxypeptidase e   <cit> . in plants most sbts are predicted to function in extracellular spaces, based on the presence of an n-terminal secretion signal sequence  <cit> . in arabidopsis, atsbt <dig>  and atsbt <dig>  have been shown to cleave psk <dig> and ralf <dig>  respectively  <cit> , suggesting a conserved peptide processing mechanism between animals and plants.

a conventional way to study peptide cleavage is through gel-based assays in combination with heterologously produced peptidases  <cit> . due to the low sensitivity of the method, it is often difficult to detect small peptide fragments. the peptidomic technology developed in recent years has the potential to solve this problem  <cit> . as an example, peptidomic comparison between a mouse mutant defective in carboxypeptidase e  and the wild-type revealed a role of the carboxypeptidase in neuropeptide processing  <cit> . in medicago truncatula, peptidomic technology has been applied to identify small peptides, although most peptides detected seem to be degradation products from abundant proteins such as ribosomal proteins and histones  <cit> .

by taking advantage of the well-studied clv <dig>  we established a ms-based peptidomic method to examine peptide fragments cleaved by enzymes secreted from intact arabidopsis seedlings. using the method we identified two internal cleavage sites in the clv <dig> proprotein, one before met <dig> and another one before arg <dig>  further, we demonstrated that the leu <dig> and 5-aa residues flanking the n-terminus of the clv <dig> peptide are important for the cleavage before arg <dig> and for the optimal activity in vitro.

RESULTS
heterologously produced clv <dig> fusion protein is active in vitro
for the production of the clv <dig> proprotein , a construct was made in which tandem aligned trx and his tags were fused to the n-terminus of clv <dig> . the construct was transformed to e. coli strain bl <dig> to produce the th-proclv <dig> fusion protein with a total molecular mass of  <dig>  kd. the th-proclv <dig> was then purified by affinity chromatography using a ni-nta agarose column , and quantified by bradford assay  <cit>  after dialyzed using a 7-kd cut-off dialysis bag.

in vitro activity assays of the th-proclv <dig> fusion protein in sams were performed using clv3- <dig> and clv1- <dig>  mutants of arabidopsis, as described previously  <cit> . we observed that the incubation of clv3- <dig> seedlings with  <dig> Î¼m th-proclv <dig> for  <dig> days led to significant reduced sizes of sams , while no evident reduction was observed in sams of clv1- <dig> seedlings , suggesting that the th-proclv <dig> fusion protein produced in e. coli is active in restricting sams in a clv1-dependent manner.

similarly, in vitro root assays  <cit>  were performed in ler and clv2- <dig>  seedlings. we observed that root growths in ler seedlings treated with th-proclv <dig> were inhibited greatly , as previously reported in the clv <dig> peptide treatment  <cit> , while ler seedlings grown on media without the fusion protein showed normal root growth . in contrast, no evident growth inhibition was observed in clv2- <dig> seedlings grown on media with th-proclv <dig> . microscopic examinations revealed that the th-proclv <dig> treatment resulted in termination of rms in ler, but not in clv2- <dig> . these results together suggest that the th-proclv <dig> fusion protein produced in e. coli is active in regulating the sizes of sams and rms.

detection of cleavages in clv <dig> fusion protein
to analyze the cleavage of clv <dig>  we developed a maldi-tof ms-based method to profile peptide fragments produced in vitro. pre-germinated ler seedlings were inoculated with the th-proclv <dig> fusion protein in a liquid medium, then the media were harvested at different time points and subjected directly to maldi-tof ms analyses. the fusion protein inoculated in the same medium without seedlings was used as a control. we observed that the optimal time for analyzing peptide cleavage was  <dig> hr after the incubation with ler seedlings, when abundant small peptides with different molecular masses were detected .

to obtain exact sequences of these fragments, q-tof ms/ms analyses were performed in these samples. sequest searches for peptide sequences matching the clv <dig> proprotein allowed us to identify over  <dig> peptides . among them, both the clv3p <dig> and the clv3p <dig> peptides, the backbones of two candidate forms of mature clv <dig> peptides  <cit> , were included . after alignment of these fragments with the clv <dig> proprotein, two most frequently occurring termini, n-terminal met <dig> and arg <dig>  were detected , suggesting internal cleavage sites located before met <dig> and before arg <dig>  the cleavage before arg <dig> has been previously reported  <cit> , however, the one before met <dig> is novel. since met <dig> is located in the non-functional region  <cit> , the cleavage might be not functional relevant.

it should be noted that, although peptides with c-terminal his <dig> and his <dig> were detected, no peptides with matching n-terminal his <dig> and val <dig> were found. instead, we detected peptides with variable c-termini. it is plausible that no specific internal cleavage site are present in this region, while carboxypeptidases are involved in processing the c-terminus of the clv <dig>  recently, tamaki et al. showed that an endosome-localized sol <dig> carboxypeptidase is responsible for removing the c-terminal arg residue from the cle <dig> proprotein  <cit> . since intact ler seedlings were used in our assay, the c-terminal processing activities detected may come from non-specific extracellular carboxypeptidases instead of sol <dig> 

n-terminal flanking sequence affected the cleavage of clv3
to examine if residues flanking the n-terminus of the clv <dig> peptide are required for internal cleavage, we chemically synthesized the clv3p <dig> and peptides with additional  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> residues, namely l-clv3p <dig>  eel-clv3p <dig>  heel-clv3p <dig> and lheel-clv3p <dig>  these peptides were inoculated in liquid media with arabidopsis  seedlings, and medium samples were harvested at different time points and subjected directly to maldi-tof ms analyses. we observed that the optimal time for analyzing the cleavage of these peptides was  <dig> d after the inoculation, when abundant cleaved fragments were detected . for clv3p <dig> and l-clv3p <dig> we observed a gradual removal of residues from both n- and c-termini . for eel-clv3p <dig>  removal of the c-terminal his residue was observed, but not n-terminal residues . no internal cleavages for clv3p <dig>  l-clv3p <dig> and eel-clv3p <dig> were detected. in contrast, in addition to gradual removal of terminal residues for heel-clv3p <dig> and lheel-clv3p <dig>  internal cleavages were also observed . in particular, for heel-clv3p <dig>  a cleavage before thr <dig> was observed, producing an 11-aa peptide that is expected to be non-functional  <cit> , while for lheel-clv3p <dig>  cleavages before arg <dig> and thr <dig> were detected, producing the functional clv3p <dig> and a non-functional 11-aa peptide, respectively . as such, it is possible that the internal cleavage before arg <dig> requires at least  <dig> flanking residues, while exopeptidases are involved in removing residues from both termini.

clv <dig> peptide with five additional n-terminal flanking residues showed similar activity as clv3p12
to evaluate activities of above-mentioned synthetic peptides with various n-terminal extensions, we performed in vitro root assays using ler seedlings. the lengths of primary roots were measured after 8-d inoculations with either clv3p <dig>  l-clv3p <dig>  eel-clv3p <dig>  heel-clv3p <dig> or lheel-clv3p <dig> at concentrations of  <dig> nm,  <dig> nm,  <dig> nm, or  <dig> Î¼m . the results showed that clv2p <dig> was active at the concentration of  <dig> nm, eel-clv3p <dig> was active at  <dig> nm, while l-clv3p <dig> and heel-clv3p <dig> were not active even at  <dig> Î¼m, suggesting that these additional n-terminal leu, glu-glu-leu or his-glu-glu-leu residues caused severe damages to their activities, strikingly, lheel-clv3p <dig> was equally active as clv3p <dig>  i.e. functional at  <dig> nm. together with the effective cleavage observed above, we believe that the additional  <dig> residues in lheel-clv3p <dig> lead to effective release of clv3p <dig>  and hence the equivalent activity as clv3p <dig> 

leu <dig> is critical for the cleavage and activity in synthetic peptide
previous studies suggest that psk and ralf are produced through the cleavage after a leu residue by endopeptidases in arabidopsis <cit> . to examine if the leu <dig> adjacent to the n-terminus of the clv <dig> peptide is involved in cleavage, we synthesized an ala-substituted peptide, lheea-clv3p <dig>  and used maldi-tof ms to examine its cleavage after inoculation with seedlings in vitro. interestingly, although removal of a c-terminal residue was observed, no internal cleavage was detected , suggesting that the leu69ala substitution had compromised the internal cleavage in the peptide. we also examined the activity of the lheea-clv3p <dig> peptide in root assays, and observed that the substitution led to a significantly reduced activity in terminating rms . these results together indicate that the n-terminal flanking leu <dig> is critical for the internal cleavage, and subsequently for the activity of the peptide.

leu <dig> is important for the optimal activity of clv <dig> fusion proteins
to evaluate if the leu <dig> is also important for the th-proclv <dig> fusion protein, we performed an ala substitution to produce a th-proclv3leu69ala fusion protein in e. coli. the activity of th-proclv3leu69ala in restricting the size of sams was examined in vitro. the results showed that sams in th-proclv3leu69ala-treated clv3- <dig> seedlings were significantly larger than those treated with th-proclv <dig> . of course compared to non-treated clv3- <dig> seedlings  they are still smaller. it is evident that the leu69ala substitution in th-proclv3leu69ala has partially compromised its activity in sams.

the commonly known subtilase recognition site is lys/arg-arg  <cit> . although in most cle members of arabidopsis the residue located before the conserved arg of the 12-aa cle motif is lys , for clv <dig> the residue is leu. we examined if a leu69lys substitution hampered the activity of the fusion protein. th-proclv3leu69lys was produced in e. coli and applied to clv3- <dig> seedlings in vitro. as expected, no significant difference was observed between the sizes of sams treated with th-proclv3leu69lys and those treated with th-proclv <dig> , suggesting that the leu69lys substitution did not affect the activity. additionally, we performed in vitro sam assays in clv1- <dig>  and observed no significant differences among samples treated with th-proclv <dig>  th-proclv3leu69ala, th-proclv3leu69lys, and non-treated ones , implying that the functions of th-proclv3leu69ala and th-proclv3leu69lys fusion proteins in sams are clv1-dependent, as the clv <dig> peptide  <cit> .

to address if these fusion proteins are able to repress the wus expression in sams, qrt-pcr analyses were performed with cdnas from shoot apices after treatments with various fusion proteins. as shown in figureÂ 5f, the expression level of wus in shoot apices of th-proclv3-treated clv3- <dig> seedlings was reduced to about 10% of those non-treated ones. a similar result was obtained in clv3- <dig> seedlings treated with th-proclv3leu69lys , confirming that the leu69lys substitution did not impair the activity of the fusion protein. in contrast, the expression level of wus in the th-proclv3leu69ala-treated clv3- <dig> seedlings was only about 50% of the untreated ones . the fact that replacement of leu <dig> by ala, but not by lys, damaged the activity of clv <dig> suggests that, although the leu <dig> is not part of the mature clv <dig> peptide, it is important for the optimal activity in repressing the wus expression in sams.

leu <dig> is critical for the cleavage of clv <dig> fusion proteins
to examine if the leu69ala and leu69lys substitutions in fusion proteins, namely th-proclv3leu69ala and th-proclv3leu69lys, respectively, led to compromised cleavages, q-tof ms/ms analyses were performed on medium samples collected after co-cultivations of these fusion proteins with wildtype seedlings. the th-proclv3leu69lys showed a similar peptide profile as seen in the th-proclv <dig> , producing expected clv3p <dig> and clv3p <dig>  and peptides with a c-terminal lys <dig>  however, for th-proclv3leu69ala, although both the clv3p <dig> and clv3p <dig> were detected, no peptide fragment with c-terminal ala <dig> was detected , suggesting that the leu69ala substitution may have compromised the cleavage efficiency of the fusion protein or decreased the stability of peptides produced. these results together indicate that both the leu-arg and lys-arg junctions can be recognized and cleaved by enzymes released by arabidopsis seedlings.

5-aa n-terminal flanking sequence is required for proper cleavage of cle1
to address if the requirement of 5-aa residues in the proper cleavage of clv <dig> is generic to other cle peptides, we synthesized cle <dig> peptides with either  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> n-terminal flanking residues: cle1p <dig>  m-cle1p <dig> and fnesm-cle1p <dig>  respectively. cle <dig> was selected as it complements the clv3- <dig> mutant phenotype when expressed under the control of clv <dig> regulatory elements in transgenic plants  <cit> . within the 5-aa n-terminal flanking sequence, only the glu  residue is conserved between clv <dig> and cle <dig> . after 3-d incubation with ler seedlings, gradual trimmings of terminal residues were observed in both cle1p <dig> and m-cle1p <dig>  while an internal cleavage was detected between met  and arg  in fnesm-cle1p <dig>  releasing cle1p <dig> . this suggested that the 5-aa motif is required for proper cleavage of cle <dig>  as expected, when in vitro activity assays were performed in clv3- <dig> seedlings, fnesm-cle1p <dig> exhibited a similar activity as the cle1p <dig> in restricting the sizes of sams, while m-cle1p <dig> was about 100-fold less active .

discussion
although it has been shown in arabidopsis that clv <dig> acts as a peptide ligand to regulate the number of stem cells in sams  <cit> , how the peptide is generated from the proprotein and if a particular sequence motif is required for the cleavage remain largely unknown. in this study using ms-based analyses, we identified two internal cleavage sites in clv <dig> fusion protein produced in e. coli, one before met <dig> and another one before arg <dig>  synthetic peptides with  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> extra aas flanking the n-terminus of the clv3p <dig> showed greatly reduced activities in terminating rms in vitro, while a peptide with  <dig> extra aas restored the activity completely. peptidomic studies showed that clv <dig> and its orthologous cle <dig> peptides with 5-aa n-terminal extension exhibited normal cleavage, while shorter extensions hampered the cleavage.

two internal cleavage sites identified in clv3
peptide hormones are important signal molecules in endocrinal and neural signal transductions in animals  <cit> . they are usually generated from larger protein precursors through post-translational processing by sbt family endopeptidases  <cit> . among  <dig> sbt endopeptidases identified in the arabidopsis genome,  <dig> of them carry a secretory signal peptide  <cit> ; two of them, atsbt <dig>  and atsbt <dig> , are involved in psk <dig> and ralf <dig> processing, respectively  <cit> . clv <dig> encodes a 96-aa preprotein and acts as a 12- and/or 13-aa peptide with hydroxylation and glycosylation modifications  <cit> . we speculated that, if clv <dig> is processed by secreted enzyme, it should be possible to detect such enzymatic activities in vitro. we produced the th-clv <dig> fusion protein in e. coli and showed it is functional in restoring the clv <dig> defect in sams in vitro through a clv1-dependent pathway. an in vitro cleavage assay was subsequently developed to demonstrate that the th-proclv <dig> fusion protein was efficiently cleaved  <dig> hr after inoculation with arabidopsis seedlings, releasing both clv3p <dig> and clv3p <dig> peptides. after alignments of all fragments released from the clv <dig> fusion protein, we confirmed a previously reported cleavage site located before arg <dig>  <cit>  and found a novel cleavage one before met <dig>  as met <dig> is located in a region that is not required for the clv <dig> function  <cit> , the cleavage might not be functionally relevant.

the n-terminal junction region is critical for clv <dig> cleavage
previous studies have shown that the leu <dig> residue is moderately and arg <dig> is highly important for the clv <dig> function in vivo <cit> , although leu <dig> is not part of the clv <dig> mature peptide  <cit> . the involvement of arg <dig> in clv <dig> processing in vitro has been reported  <cit> . to evaluate the importance of the leu <dig> in cleavage, we introduced either leu69ala or leu69lys substitutions to the th-proclv <dig> fusion protein and examined their efficiencies in cleavage and subsequently activities in restricting the size of sams. we observed that th-proclv3leu69lys was cleaved in a similar manner as th-proclv <dig>  while specific cleavages were compromised in th-proclv3leu69ala, suggesting that enzymes released by arabidopsis seedlings can cleave both the lys-arg and leu-arg junctions. to be noted, the cleavage in the leu-arg junction has not been reported so far in peptide processing in animals. among cle family members, although the n-terminal arg residue in the cle motif is highly conserved, the residue immediately before the arg is less conserved . in medicago a cleavage at a upstream site before the conserved lys-arg junction has been reported  <cit> . for psk <dig> and ralf <dig>  instead of the dibasic arg-arg site located upstream, cleavages were detected at the leu-his and leu-ala junctions, respectively  <cit> . it is possible that endopeptidases in plants have more diverse cleavage sites than those in animals.

the n-terminal flanking sequence of clv <dig> is critical for efficient cleavage
furin is the first sbt discovered in mammals  <cit> . a 4-aa sequence, arg-asn-lys-arg, flanking the n-terminus of ectodysplasin-a is essential for its processing by furin  <cit> . in arabidopsis, six psk members with different sequences before the cleavage site show different efficiencies of cleavage by atsbt <dig>   <cit> . for clv <dig> it has been shown previously that addition of a c-terminal his <dig> to the clv <dig> peptide did not have significant effect on its activity in terminating rms in vitro, while addition of an n-terminal leu <dig> compromised the activity greatly  <cit> . in this study we examined effects of adding different numbers of aa residues to the n-terminus of the clv <dig> peptide, and observed that peptides with either  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> additional residues showed reduced activities in terminating rms. however, the lheel-clv3p <dig> with a 5-aa extension showed the same activity as the clv3p <dig>  further peptidomic analyses revealed that peptides with 1-, 3- or 4-aa extensions were not processed properly, while the one with 5-aa additional residues was. the positive correlation between peptide activity and effective cleavage in lheel-clv3p <dig> suggests that the 5-aa motif flanking the n-terminus is required for the recognition and proper cleavage to release the functional clv <dig> peptide. consistent with this hypothesis, we showed that the leu69ala substitutions in the lheea-clv3p <dig> peptide and th-proclv3leu69ala fusion protein led to reduced activities in terminating rms and compromised internal cleavage.

with evidence obtained so far, we believe that the length of the n-terminal flanking sequence is more important than the aa identities, with the following reasons: 1) our previous alanine substitution experiments in the flanking residues of clv <dig> showed that individual aa in this region contribute very little to clv <dig> function in vivo <cit> ; 2) alignment of all cle proteins encoded in the arabidopsis genome showed very little conservation in the 5-aa flanking region ; 3) cle <dig> shares only one aa  with clv <dig> within the 5-aa motif and is able to complement clv3- <dig> when expressed under the clv <dig> regulatory elements  <cit> ; 4) synthetic cle <dig> peptide with the 5-aa n-terminal extension was cleaved properly when inoculated with arabidopsis seedlings. most likely the 5-aa flanking motif serves as an endopeptidase recognition and/or binding domain for clv <dig> and cle <dig> cleavages.

CONCLUSIONS
we developed an in vitro seedling assay to analyze peptide cleavages and activities in shoot and root meristems in parallel. using the assay we showed that the maximal activity of the clv <dig> requires a proper cleavage between leu <dig> and arg <dig>  and the cleavage requires a recognition domain with at least 5-aa flanking its n-terminus. these findings may help to elucidate the cleavage and function of other peptide hormones, and to identify enzymes involved in peptide processing.
