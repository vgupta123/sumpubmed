BACKGROUND
even though thailand was a leading producer of cultured black tiger shrimp , generating at least  <dig>  metric tons with an income of over  <dig> billion usd annually in the nineties  <cit> , the shrimp industry has deteriorated due to widespread disease, slow growth rate, and low quality broodstock.

the reproductive maturation of both males and females of penaeid shrimp are poorly understood  <cit> , and the males have been studied even less than in the females  <cit> . reduced degrees of maturation are usually observed in the captive brooders compared to the wild brooders. for instance, when mated with wild males, the wild females gave higher egg production and % fertilized eggs than the pond-reared females. similarly, when mated with wild females, the wild males gave higher % fertilized eggs and % nauplii than the pond-reared males  <cit> . in females, the low degrees of reproductive maturation in captivity can be relieved by unilateral eyestalk ablation technique that can induce ovarian development and ovulation  <cit> . however, the technique does not affect the male reproductive maturation  <cit> . moreover, there has not been any report on optimal age of the males for mating though a previous study in p. monodon suggested that age positively correlated to the gonad weight, spermatophore weight, sperm count and % normal sperm  <cit> . therefore, it is important to understand fundamental differences in molecular mechanisms between domesticated and wild-caught male broodstock in order to improve farming conditions and sustain the aquaculture of this species.

various efforts have been made to study the fundamental mechanism of male reproduction in this species. leelatanawit et al. constructed subtractive cdna libraries of p. monodon ovaries and testes to identify gender-specific transcripts  <cit> . unfortunately, almost all of the preferentially expressed ests in the p. monodon testis were unknown transcripts . a search for genes differentially expressed in testes was continued by constructing conventional and subtractive est libraries from testis of p. monodon to identify several reproduction-related genes such as pmtst <dig> , spermatogonial stem-cell renewal factor, transformer  <dig> , progestin receptor membrane component  <dig>  and dmc <dig>  <cit> . recently, more testis ests  were sequenced and analyzed to indentify more testis-relevant genes in this organism  <cit> . these previous studies started to shed some light onto potential genes involved in testicular development. yet, further investigation is needed to understand this process in p. monodon.

microarray technology can simultaneously monitor gene expression levels of a large number of genes  <cit> . previously, we have constructed a reproduction-specific cdna microarray  to study different stages of the ovarian development of the black tiger shrimp and able to identify many important reproduction-related genes exhibiting a differential expression profile during its ovarian development such as nuclear autoantigenic sperm protein   <cit> .

in this study, we have constructed another version of microarray containing unigenes to include more genes on the array for more diverse studies of this species. this is the first report in the black tiger shrimp to use the microarray technique to study testicular development. the microarray results identified differentially expressed gene clusters which might be involved in differences between domesticated and wild-caught male broodstock. some of these genes ) were further characterized for their possible roles on testicular development.

RESULTS
features of unishrimpchip
a cdna microarray, unishrimpchip, was constructed from  <dig>  sequences of the previously established  <dig> est libraries  <cit>  and spotted in duplicate on each microarray slide . a total of  <dig> control spots include both positive  and negative controls . the highest numbers of features on unishrimpchip was sequences found in testis and ovary est libraries  of p. monodon. a total of ~70% of the features were homologues of genes with putative known functions . the features of unishrimpchip were further categorized according to the gene ontology . the highest numbers of features belonged to the "biological function"  followed by the "molecular function"  and the "cellular components" .

large-scale gene expression analysis in testis of penaeus monodon
unishrimpchip was used to compare gene expression profiles of testes from wild  and domesticated brooders  by using pooled testes from juveniles as a common references  . from the total of the  <dig> microarray comparisons, the overall expression patterns of every transcript were clustered to identify relationship among the brooder types . hierarchical cluster revealed distinct differences in expression patterns between wild and domesticated brooders. among domesticated shrimp at different ages, the 18-month-old group was clearly clustered as a separated group from the other cluster that contained both 10- and 14-month-old shrimp; figure 3a. however, if only gene expression patterns of transcripts from the testis library  were considered, the hierarchical cluster of array results was different . although the wild shrimp  were still clustered together and distinct from the domesticated groups, the domesticated shrimp could be further divided to  <dig> subgroups; 18-month-old shrimp alone, 14-month-old containing a single individuals of 18-month-old and 10-month-old containing a single individual of 14-month-old shrimp. no correlation according to gonadosomatic index  and ratio of sperm sac to testis weights  was observed.

*gsi is gonadosomatic index calculate as a percentage of testis weight by total body weight

from all  <dig>  features of unishrimpchip,  <dig>  transcripts were selected for further analysis as they were present in at least  <dig> of the  <dig> microarrays . of these,  <dig>  transcripts exhibiting expression changes >  <dig>  fold in at least  <dig> of the  <dig> microarrays  were clustered according to their expression patterns . these differentially expressed transcripts were from different est library origins. the majority of these genes were from testis  and heart , whereas the remaining transcripts were from ovary , gill , hemocyte , hepatopancreas , intestine , and others  .

from the  <dig>  differentially expressed transcripts,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were expressed higher and lower in the domesticated than the wild shrimp, respectively. comparing the expression levels between juveniles and broodstock, the microarray results revealed  <dig> genes with higher expression levels in juvenile, whereas only  <dig> genes were expressed higher in broodstock. hierarchical cluster analysis of these differentially expressed transcripts revealed different gene groups . examples of selected gene groups with different expression patterns were further examined .

besides the comparison between the wild and domesticated gene expression profiles, the differences in gene expression levels among different ages within the domesticated groups  were also observed, albeit not as distinct. from the overall expression patterns, the 18-month-old profiles seemed different from the 10- and 14-month-old groups. for instance, the expression levels of the 18-month-old domesticated samples in cluster  <dig> were slightly lower than the remaining samples from the domesticated group . interestingly, from the different gene expression groups, a gene family of constitutive photomorphogenic  <dig> signalosome  homologs was presented in many clusters . the differential expression patterns of these gene subunits between the domesticated and wild groups raise a question whether they are involved in reproductive maturation in p. monodon.

gene expression levels confirmed by reverse-transcriptase quantitative pcr 
expression levels of csn <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  7a, and  <dig>  small ubiquitin-like modifier  <dig>  and zipper homologues in testes of wild broodstock  and domesticated broodstock  were confirmed using reverse-transcriptase quantitative pcr  analysis.

five csn subunits  were present in the unishrimpchip and their gene expression levels exhibited differential patterns in the microarray results. an additional subunit of this gene family, csn subunit , was just found from the recently sequenced testis cdna library of p. monodon  <cit> ; thus, the expression profiles of this subunit were included with the five subunits for rt-qpcr analysis.

the expression levels of csn4- <dig> in the wild brooders obtained from the rt-qpcr agreed with the microarray data. the most distinct expression levels of the testes from the west coast of thailand were significantly higher than the rest . with the domesticated group of different ages, the expression levels of the csn <dig>  csn <dig>  csn <dig>  csn <dig> and csn7a were lowest in the samples of 18-month-old domesticated group; the lower expression levels of the 18-month-old domesticated group were significant for the csn <dig> and csn <dig> transcripts . also, agreed with the microarray results, the rt-qpcr results showed that the expression levels of csn7a and csn <dig> exhibited no significant difference among the samples . moreover, among the six subunits of the csn genes studied in the work, csn <dig> and csn <dig> were expressed at much lower levels than other subunits .

besides the csn gene family, two additional genes , representing different expression patterns were also validated by the rt-qpcr analysis. from the microarray result, the zipper transcript was expressed higher in the domesticated group than in the wild samples . the rt-qpcr results also revealed significantly higher expression levels of this transcript in the domesticated group than in the wild brooders . for sumo- <dig>  the microarray data suggested comparable expression levels in all groups  which were confirmed by the rt-qpcr results that the expression levels were not significantly different  in all samples tested .

full-length cdna sequences and phylogenetic analysis of csn <dig> and csn6
the full-length cdna sequence of the csn gene family has never been reported in any crustacean. in this study, the full-length orf of pmcsn <dig> and pmcsn <dig>  were successfully isolated by race-pcr. for the pmcsn <dig>  an orf of  <dig>  bp corresponding to  <dig> amino acids, with 5'utr and 3'utr of  <dig> and  <dig> bp , respectively, were identified . the predicted pi and molecular weight  of the deduced csn <dig> protein were  <dig>  and  <dig>  kda, respectively. the closest similarity of this transcript was csn <dig> of apis mellifera . for the pmcsn <dig>  the full-length cdna sequence contains an orf of  <dig>  bp corresponding to  <dig> amino acids with 5'utr and 3'utr of  <dig> and  <dig> bp , respectively . the predicted pi and mw of the deduced pmcsn <dig> were  <dig>  and  <dig>  kda, respectively. the closest similarity of the pmcsn <dig> transcript was csn <dig> of xenopus laevis . both of the deduced pmcsn <dig> and pmcsn <dig> proteins contained a jab/mpn domain .

a bootstrapped neighbor-joining tree indicated that vertebrate csn5s are extremely conserved across different taxa . the newly characterized pmcsn <dig> was phylogenetically recognized as a member of invertebrate csn5s. although it showed the closest similarity with apis mellifera csn5s based on sequence similarity comparison, they are distantly related among each other phylogenetically. in addition, both pmcsn5s and amcsn5s are more differentiated from other invertebrate csn5s than that of other species. interestingly, pmcsn <dig> was phylogenetically allocated to a member of the vertebrate rather than the invertebrate csn6s along with that of strongylocentrotus purpuratus and ixodes scapularis .

discussion
identification and characterization of genes related to testicular development by microarray analysis
a cdna microarray, unishrimpchip, was constructed from a total of  <dig>  features from different est libraries to cover unigenes of the black tiger shrimp peneaus monodon. the usefulness of the unishrimpchip was demonstrated in identification of differentially expressed genes possibly involved in different testicular development degrees in wild and domesticated male p. monodon brooders. the gene expression profiles of the wild brooders from west and east coasts of thailand and domesticated brooders with different ages  were compared to a same reference of testes pooled from  <dig> juvenile shrimp.

with every gene on the array, their overall gene expression patterns indicated the wild brooders, especially if they were from the same coast, exhibited similar patterns, whereas the domesticated groups expressed distinctively from the wild groups. although actual differences between captive and wild male brooders are not well understood and some suggested no difference in sperm quality between the two  <cit> , other early reports indicated that wild-caught brooders have higher reproductive success than in the captive counterparts  <cit> . another study reported that using wild instead of captive males with either wild or domesticated females has successfully resolved a problem from low quality of offspring . moreover, captive male p. monodon yields lower fertilization rates of zygotes and lower survival rates of offspring than wild male p. monodon  <cit> . the differences in the overall gene expression patterns between the wild and captive male brooders provide additional evidence to support that the difference in reproductive performance of the wild and captive broodstock might even be rooted at the transcriptomic level.

considering the hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed genes, many interesting patterns were identified. for instance, the higher expression levels in domesticated broodstock in clusters i and ii might include genes whose functions are relevant to inhibiting maturation; therefore, their high expression levels might jeopardize the maturation levels in the captive male. consequently, these genes should be further examined as they might be potential markers pinpointing maturity levels in this animal.

various origins of the differential expressed genes from the microarray analysis confirm the versatility of unishrimpchip. although it is not surprising many  of the differentially expressed transcripts came from testis library, ~70% of the differentially expressed transcripts came from the other libraries combined. the significant contributions from other tissue libraries emphasize the benefit of including genes from various organs on the arrays to provide additional coverage in gene expression study.

validation of gene expression profiles by reverse-transcriptase quantitative pcr 
to validate gene expression profiles of some selected transcripts belonging to different gene groups in microarray data, reverse-transcriptase quantitative pcr  was performed for zipper, sumo- <dig>  and six csn genes. the rt-qpcr results mostly agreed with microarray results.

the expression levels of sumo- <dig> in different brooder groups were validated by rt-qpcr, and its relatively stable expression levels from the rt-qpcr were in accord with the microarray result. sumo- <dig> was first reported in p. monodon from the testis est analysis and its transcript levels were found to be significantly lower in the domesticated than in the wild male brooders  <cit> . similarly, we found the similar trend between the wild  and the domesticated samples, albeit not significantly different. the discrepancy between the previous and our reports could be explained by different of samples used in each study; for instance, the age of domesticated samples was not reported in the previous study.

for zipper, its higher transcript levels in domesticated than in the wild group from the microarray data were confirmed by the rt-qpcr. in drosophila, zipper encodes for a conventional non-muscle myosin heavy chain, nmmhc  <cit>  whose functions involved in embryonic development  <cit> . the homologues of zipper are expressed in many species such as in chickens  <cit>  and in humans  <cit> ,. recently, simons et al. reported that the two nmmhc-encoding genes were expressed differently in some rat tissues such as in brain and testis  <cit> . though an actual function in testis of this gene family has not been established, the significant differences in expression levels between the wild and domesticated groups in our study might suggest that this gene could serve as a candidate biomarker indicating different maturation levels in testicular development in p. monodon brooders. further characterization of this gene should be pursued to understand its molecular mechanism in testicular maturation and examine its roles on lower degree of male reproduction in captive brooders.

another group of genes that were investigated through the rt-qpcr analysis was the csn gene family. in addition to the five subunits  included in unishrimpchip, csn <dig> found from the testis est library was also examined by the rt-qpcr. compared to their expression patterns in the unishrimpchip, the expression patterns of the five csn genes were confirmed by the rt-qpcr results. the higher expression patterns of the csn4- <dig> in the wild, especially from the west coast, than in the domesticated groups could suggest their relevance to the better testicular development of the west wild brooders. if these genes are involved in boosting testicular development, the significantly decreased expression levels of the csn <dig> and csn <dig> transcripts in the 18-month-old domesticated brooders from both microarray and rt-qpcr results would imply that the optimal mating age should be before  <dig> months. this information can be very useful for the p. monodon farming practice because an optimal age for reproductive maturity of a male brooder is not determined. in another related shrimp species litopenaeus vannamei, a male brooder at  <dig> months is considered to give highest sperm quality based on spermatophore weight, sperm count, and percentage of normal sperm  <cit> . therefore, the decrease in expressions of potential maturation-related genes at  <dig> months would be an undesired condition.

the cop <dig> signalosome  was first found in arabidopsis thaliana mutants that exhibited constitutive photomorphogenesis, and hence its initial name as constitutive photomorphogenesis  <dig>   <cit> . there are eight subunits of csn found so far but not all eight subunits were found in all organisms  <cit> . in p. monodon, only six csn subunits  were found in the testis, ovary, hemocyte, and gill est libraries <cit> . the homologs of csn <dig> and csn <dig> have not been found in p. monodon.

due to different names of cop <dig> signalosome homologues in various organisms, the names have been unified to csn  <cit> , whose system has been adopted in our study. although the functions of the csn are not well understood, there are many reports linking csn with 19s proteasome based on their evolutionary relationship sharing the same number of eight subunits  <cit> . some studies reported that e <dig> ubiquitin ligases were found to interact with the csn, suggesting that csn may function in assembling scf  complexes by bridging e3s and the proteasome  <cit> . however, clear biochemical and functional evidence of these hypotheses must be further verified.

from other previous studies in various organisms, loss of certain individual csn subunits resulted in distinct phenotypes, suggesting that individual csn subunits may have different and independent roles. for instance, in drosophila, csn has been implicated in oogenesis, embryogenesis, and neuronal development  <cit> . in rat testis, csn <dig> was expressed differently at different developmental stages  <cit> . these links between some of these csn subunits and testicular development in other organisms raise a question whether these genes are also involved in the male reproductive process of the black tiger shrimp.

the full-length cdna sequences of the csn <dig> and csn6
among the csn genes, csn <dig> and csn <dig> were expressed significantly lower in the 18-month-old domesticated group than any other groups but higher in the wild brooders from the west coast. therefore, their full-length cdna sequences were further characterized by race-pcr. for the first time in crustacean, the full-length csn <dig> and csn <dig> cdna sequences were successfully characterized and revealed a jab/mpn domain in both deduced proteins. this domain is one of the signature domains of a proteasome which was first observed at the n-terminus of the yeast proteins mpr1p and pad1p  <cit> . among the eight subunits of the csn, two subunits  contain the jab/mpn domain, whereas the remaining subunits contain a pci domain  <cit> . the csn <dig> homolog, jab <dig>  has been found in mouse and its rna expression in testes was noticeably abundant in mouse embryonic tissue  <cit> . in drosophila, the disruption of csn <dig> gene resulted in lethality at the late larval or pupal stage, suggesting its essentiality for the development to the adult stage  <cit> . while csn <dig> homologs in various organisms have been linked to reproduction and development, there are less numbers of reports linking csn <dig> to reproduction. instead, csn <dig> was linked to apoptosis in vertebrates. when a cytoplasmic protein, nod <dig>  is activated as a part of apoptotic pathway to provide immune response against invading pathogens in mammals, csn <dig>  was cleaved from the cop <dig> complex, jeopardizing the complex's functions  <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis suggests that csn <dig> is evolutionarily conserved in vertebrates and most invertebrates. nevertheless, pmcsn <dig> was more differentiated from that of the other members of the insecta . the molecular phylogeny reflects distant relationships between crustaceans and insect which is in agreement with that based on the conventional systematics. in contrast, p. monodon, strongylocentrotus purpuratus and ixodes scapularis csn6s were allocated to be evolutionarily closer to the vertebrate than the invertebrate csn6s . this should not be the artifact from the phylogenetic analysis but the data implied that csn <dig> in these and other invertebrates may be encoded by different loci. southern blotting should be applied to determine whether pmcsn <dig> is encoded from more than one locus. however, this is beyond the scope of our present study.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, unishrimpchip, a cdna microarray containing non-redundant sequences of the p. monodon unigenes, was successfully constructed and employed in a high-throughput comparative gene expression analysis to identify genes potentially involved in the reproductive maturation differences between male brooders from the wild and domestication. through comparison between different groups of male brooders , several genes were identified to exhibit differential expression patterns. among those genes, the gene expression levels of sumo- <dig>  zipper, and six csn genes were further validated by rt-qpcr and the results mostly agreed with the microarray data. because of their significant decreased transcript levels in the 18-month-old captive brooders, the full-length cdna sequences of the two csn genes, csn <dig> and csn <dig>  were further characterized to compare with other organisms.

this study demonstrates the usefulness of the unishrimpchip for comparative gene expression study. for the first time, the findings reveal the possibility of the csn gene homologs to be involved in testicular maturation and development in the black tiger shrimp. though further studies to pinpoint the molecular mechanisms of these genes in testicular development are required, through microarray technique, these results open a new door to narrow down candidate genes relevant to an important developmental process of this important animal.
