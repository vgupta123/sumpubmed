BACKGROUND
ethylene is a simple gas that acts as a plant hormone; it controls various processes in the plant life cycle, including seed germination, root hair development, root nodulation, flower senescence, abscission, and fruit ripening  <cit> . ethylene also is synthesized in response to stresses such as pathogen attack, wounding, hypoxia, ozone, chilling, and freezing  <cit> . these responses are controlled through integration of the pathways for ethylene biosynthesis, perception, and signal transduction. the ethylene biosynthesis and signalling pathways have been well characterized with regard to physiology, biochemistry, molecular biology, and genetics. studies of arabidopsis thaliana revealed a universally conserved set of components in the ethylene signaling pathway for all plants. ethylene is perceived by ethylene receptor family etr <dig>  etr <dig>  ein <dig>  ers <dig>  ers <dig>  <cit>  and their assembly requires the ran <dig> copper transporter  <cit> . the signal is further transduced by the signaling pathway components ctr <dig>  a raf-like mapkkk  <cit> , ein <dig>  an nramp-related integral membrane protein  <cit> , and a cascade of transcriptional regulators ein3/eils  <cit> , erf <dig>  <cit> , edf1- <dig>  <cit> . the proteolysis of ein3/eil proteins by ethylene-regulated ebf1/ <dig> f-box proteins plays a key role in regulation of all known responses to the hormone  <cit> . a mapk  cascade was proposed to be involved in ethylene signaling  <cit> , however, a recent study showed that atmpk <dig> is not involved in ethylene signaling but instead involved in the regulation of ethylene biosynthesis through atacs <dig>  <cit> . other yet unidentified components are thought to be involved as well  <cit> .

the biosynthetic pathway of ethylene has been studied in detail, and genes encoding the two key enzymes have been cloned and characterized  <cit> . 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate  synthase  converts s-adenosyl-l-methionine  to acc and then, acc oxidase  produces ethylene through oxidization of acc. generally, the reaction catalyzed by acs is a rate-limiting step  <cit> .

both acs and aco are encoded by gene families in many plant species. in the case of tomato , there are at least  <dig> acs  <cit>  and four aco genes  <cit> . the members of acs and aco gene families are differentially expressed in development or in response to stimuli such as germination, leaf senescence and flower abscission, fruit ripening, wounding, flooding, exposure to ozone, touch, hormone treatment, and pathogen attack  <cit> . recent findings suggest that posttranscriptional regulation is an important aspect of the control of acs expression  <cit> . pharmacological and molecular biological studies have suggested that phosphorylation is involved in the regulation of acs activity  <cit> . a tomato acs, le-acs <dig>  is phosphorylated in the c-terminal region and this modification appears to be involved in the posttranslational regulation of the enzyme  <cit> . however, the molecular mechanisms by which plants regulate ethylene biosynthesis at the posttranscriptional or posttranslational levels remain unclear.

recent studies of the arabidopsis ethylene-overproducer mutants   <cit>  revealed mechanisms underlying the posttranslational regulation of ethylene biosynthesis. the eto mutants constitutively display the ethylene-evoked triple response phenotypes in the absence of exogenously applied hormone; they can be distinguished from ctr <dig> mutants, which also displays the triple response in the absence of ethylene, because the phenotypes of eto mutants are suppressed by inhibitors of ethylene biosynthesis and action  <cit> . therefore, the eto mutants are likely impaired in either the regulators or the structural enzymes of ethylene biosynthesis. eto <dig> is a recessive mutation that results in an approximately 10-fold ethylene overproduction in etiolated seedlings compared to wild-type plants  <cit> , whereas eto2- <dig> and eto <dig> are dominant mutations that cause 20- and 100-fold increases of ethylene biosynthesis, respectively, in etiolated seedlings  <cit> . the eto2- <dig> and eto <dig> were identified as mutations within the closely related atacs <dig> and atacs <dig> genes, respectively. these mutations cause alterations of the c-terminal amino acid sequences of each protein  <cit> . furthermore, both eto <dig> and eto2- <dig> mutations increase the stability of the atacs <dig> protein  <cit> , suggesting that the c-termini of some acc synthases are involved in posttranslational regulation/processing or stability of the acs proteins mediated by eto <dig>  also another study showed that atmpk <dig> phosphorylates the c-terminus of atacs <dig> to stabilize the isozyme by a yet unknown mechanism  <cit> .

the molecular mechanism regulating the activity and stability of atacs <dig> was revealed by identification of the eto <dig> protein  <cit> . eto <dig> is a member of a novel plant-specific protein family with three distinct protein-protein interaction motifs, namely the btb domain in its n-terminus and the tpr motifs together with a coiled-coil motif in its c-terminus. the c-terminal tpr domain interacts with atacs <dig> and the n-terminal btb domain interacts with atcul <dig>  a constituent of e <dig> ubiquitin ligase complexes in which eto <dig> is proposed to serve as a substrate-specific adaptor protein. eto <dig> inhibits the enzyme activity of atacs <dig> and targets this protein for degradation in a proteasome-dependent manner. other studies also suggest that proteolysis is involved in regulation of ethylene biosynthesis  <cit> .

eto <dig> has two paralogs in arabidopsis, eol <dig> and eol <dig> , both of which also interact with and inhibit the activity of atacs <dig>  although eto1-related sequences are found in many other plant species including tomato, no studies have examined whether members of the eto <dig> protein family can interact with and regulate acc synthases other than atacs <dig>  in this study, using a heterologous system in tomato, we demonstrate that eto <dig> specifically interacts with a subfamily of acc synthases, namely type  <dig> acc synthases including atacs <dig>  atacs <dig> and le-acs <dig>  but not with other types of acc synthases including atacs <dig>  le-acs <dig> and le-acs <dig>  we also show that constitutive expression of eto <dig> results in posttranscriptional suppression of a type  <dig> acc synthase, le-acs <dig>  in transgenic tomato. these results suggest that members of the eto <dig> protein family are components in the negative regulation of type  <dig> acc synthases in the plant kingdom.

RESULTS
fruit ripening is not altered in transgenic tomato plants that overexpress eto1
orthologous sequences to eto <dig> are found in many plant species including tomato . these orthologs share high similarity with eto <dig> in their tpr domains that are thought to be involved in specific interaction with acc synthases  <cit> . actually, two eto <dig> paralogs of arabidopsis, eol <dig> and eol <dig>  interact with atacs <dig> in yeast cells and suppress its activity in escherichia coli. in tomato, ethylene is a critical regulator of fruit ripening  <cit> , and le-acs <dig> and le-acs <dig> have been shown to be involved in this process  <cit> . so, there is a possibility that any of the eto <dig> ortholog in tomato interact with and regulate these acs isozymes. because we expected heterologous interaction between arabidopsis eto <dig> and le-acs <dig> or le-acs <dig>  leading to suppression of ethylene biosynthesis in tomato fruits and retardation of its development, we introduced the arabidopsis eto <dig> cdna controlled by the camv 35s promoter into tomato  via agrobacterium-mediated transformation. transformants were selected on kanamycin-containing medium and verified using the polymerase chain reaction  . expression of the eto <dig> transgene in the t <dig> segregating individuals was detected by reverse transcription -pcr assays. all of the t <dig> lines harbouring the transgene showed expression of the exogenous eto <dig> gene . twenty-two t <dig> individual eto1-overexpressing  lines were derived from four independent t <dig> lines . however, all of the fruits of eto1-oe lines developed a full red color over the same time course as wild-type plants . these results suggest that eto <dig> may not suppress the two major acs isozymes in ripening tomato fruit, le-acs <dig> and le-acs <dig>  because there is no noteworthy interaction of eto <dig> with either le-acs <dig> or le-acs <dig> 

eto <dig> specifically interacts with le-acs <dig>  but not with le-acs <dig> or le-acs <dig>  in yeast cells
to investigate the potential interaction between the arabidopsis eto <dig> and acc synthases of tomato, we performed yeast two-hybrid assays between eto <dig> and three acs isozymes of tomato, le-acs <dig>  le-acs <dig>  and le-acs <dig>  as described above, le-acs <dig> and le-acs <dig> are major acs isozymes involved in ripening tomato fruits. le-acs <dig> is induced by auxin and flooding  <cit> . in the yeast two-hybrid assay, whereas le-acs <dig> showed a strong interaction with eto <dig>  at a level comparable to that of atacs <dig>  neither le-acs <dig> nor le-acs <dig> interacted with eto <dig> . these results suggest that eto <dig> may have a preference for a type of acs isozymes that include le-acs <dig> and atacs <dig> 

to investigate this possibility, we focused on the c-termini of various acc synthases from arabidopsis and tomato as potential targets of eto <dig>  c-terminal amino acid sequences of acc synthases are the least-conserved portion of these proteins  <cit> . however, there is one small conserved motif, rlsf , in the c-termini of several acc synthases  <cit> . a classification of acc synthases based on the similarity of dna sequences was reported by oetiker et al.  <cit> , and phylogenetic classifications based on the similarity of amino acid sequences of arabidopsis acc synthases were also devised  <cit> . apart from these classifications, based on the c-terminal consensus motif mentioned above, we further classified the acs isozymes of tomato and arabidopsis into three types as shown in fig. 3:  isozymes with long tails  after the rlsf consensus sequence ;  isozymes that possess the 'wvf ' consensus sequence just before the rlsf, have short tails  rich in arginine  and acidic amino acids  after the rlsf, and end with the 'er ' consensus ; and  isozymes lacking the rlsf consensus sequence . atacs <dig>  atacs <dig>  and atacs <dig> are not included in this alignment because atacs <dig> is a pseudogene, and atacs <dig> and  <dig> are not acc synthases but aminotransferases  <cit> . hereafter, we use the word "type" instead of "class" to avoid confusion between former sequence-based classifications and our functional classification based on c-terminal motifs and the capacity to bind eto1/eol proteins.

although the lengths of the c-terminal tails of atacs <dig>  le-acs <dig>  and le-acs <dig> are comparable to those of type  <dig> isozymes, they lack the rlsf motif and the r/d/e-rich region. therefore, we classified these three isozymes as type  <dig> isozymes along with atacs <dig>  which has a much shorter c-terminal tail. both atacs <dig> and le-acs <dig>  which interact strongly with eto <dig>  belong to type  <dig>  whereas le-acs <dig> belongs to type  <dig> and le-acs <dig> to type  <dig>  because we previously showed that the c-terminus of atacs <dig> is a target of eto <dig>  this raises the possibility that the c-termini of type  <dig> acc synthases contain some specific features necessary for the interaction with eto <dig> that may also be conserved in other plants.

eto <dig> does not interact with a series of c-terminal deletion mutants of le-acs <dig> in yeast
as described above, one notable feature of type  <dig> acc synthases is the length of the c-terminal tail after the rlsf motif. type  <dig> acc synthases possess longer c-terminal tails after the rlsf than type  <dig>  whereas type  <dig> isozymes lack the rlsf. furthermore, the c-terminus of acs appears to be proteolyzed in vivo  <cit> . although another study showed that c-terminal truncation of a type  <dig> enzyme, le-acs <dig>  does not occur in vivo  <cit> , other type  <dig> acc synthases may have their c-termini truncated to an "optimal length"  and may then become capable of interacting with eto <dig> family proteins. therefore, we examined the effect of altering the length of acs protein c-terminal tails on their interaction with eto <dig> 

two c-terminally truncated mutants of le-acs <dig> were constructed and the cdna was cloned into pact <dig> . le-acs2Δ <dig> contains a deletion of  <dig> amino acids from the c-terminal end; and as a result its c-terminus has a length comparable to native type  <dig> acs proteins . the other mutant, le-acs2Δ <dig>  was trimmed to one amino acid upstream of the rlsf . if a specific length of the c-terminal tail after the rlsf is necessary for the interaction with eto <dig>  then le-acs2Δ <dig> should interact with eto <dig> whereas le-acs2Δ <dig> should not. however, neither of these truncated mutants was able to interact with eto <dig> in the yeast two-hybrid assay . these results suggest that the length of c-termini of type  <dig> acs is not preventing eto <dig> binding. simply truncating the c-terminal tail of type  <dig> acs to the length of type  <dig> isozymes is not sufficient to allow for interaction with eto <dig> and implies that other factors are necessary for mediating this interaction.

the c-terminal sequence specific to type  <dig> acc synthases is required for the interaction with eto1
next we examined the effect of type-2-specific amino acid sequence around the rlsf on the interaction with eto <dig>  as mentioned above, type  <dig> acc synthases have a specific c-terminal consensus sequence . the rlsf is conserved in both type  <dig> and type  <dig> acc synthases, whereas the wvf motif and r/d/e-rich region are conserved only in type  <dig> acc synthases in tomato and arabidopsis . in the eto <dig> mutant, the valine residue in this wvf motif is mutated to aspartic acid in atacs <dig>  <cit> , suggesting an important role of this small motif . we replaced the c-terminal  <dig> amino acids of le-acs <dig> with amino acids 456– <dig> of le-acs <dig> . this chimeric acs protein was sufficient to recover the strong interaction with eto <dig> to a level comparable to le-acs <dig> . these results strongly suggest that the c-terminal tail specific to type  <dig> acs, comprising the wvfrlsf motif and the r/d/e-rich region, is necessary and sufficient for the interaction with eto <dig> 

overexpression of eto <dig> suppresses auxin-induced ethylene biosynthesis in tomato seedlings
to investigate the interaction between eto <dig> and le-acs <dig> in planta, we examined the induction of ethylene biosynthesis in etiolated tomato seedlings by a synthetic auxin,  <dig> -d. using t <dig> seedlings of a homozygous line of eto1-oe , we measured ethylene evolution from auxin-treated wild-type and eto <dig> transgenic tomato seedlings.

when 6-day-old etiolated wild-type seedlings were treated with  <dig> μm  <dig> -d for  <dig> h, they produced  <dig> -fold more ethylene than untreated seedlings . le-acs <dig> mrna was induced by the  <dig> -d treatment in the wild type . however, when the eto1-oe transgenic plants were treated in this manner, they produced only  <dig> -fold more ethylene when compared to untreated plants, despite le-acs <dig> mrna being strongly induced to a level comparable to wild type . these results, together with those of the yeast two-hybrid assays, indicate that overexpressed eto <dig> protein may suppress the acs activity of le-acs <dig> by a direction, which results in a reduction in ethylene biosynthesis, same as the case of atacs <dig> and cytokinin treatment in arabidopsis  <cit> .

discussion
eto <dig> interacts with and inhibits type  <dig> acc synthases
in a previous study, we demonstrated that eto <dig>  a novel plant-specific btb/tpr protein, negatively regulates an ethylene biosynthetic enzyme of arabidopsis seedlings, atacs <dig>  via direct interaction  <cit> . however, whether the interaction and the regulatory effect are limited to atacs <dig> and its paralogs/orthologs – or are common to the entire plant acc synthase family – has not been clarified. in this study, we showed the interaction between eto <dig> and acs is restricted to type  <dig> acs isozymes. we classified acc synthases into three types based on their c-terminal amino acid sequences. all members of 'class i' acc synthases of tomato  in the classification of oetiker et al.  <cit>  correspond to our type  <dig> acc synthases, while both of their 'class ii'  and 'class iii'  contains members of our type  <dig> and type  <dig>  this discrepancy may result from the different methods of the phylogenetic anlysis . on the other hand, our type  <dig> isozymes of arabidopsis are grouped into two closely related phylogenetic branches in the group b acc synthases  <cit> , and the type  <dig> isozymes belong to the branches in the group b other than the 'type 2' branches. also our type  <dig> isozymes correspond to the group a isozymes  <cit> . these coincidences may reflect the functional relevance of each type of the isozymes, and, indeed, functional heterodimerizations between closely related acs isozymes have been demonstrated  <cit> .

little is known about the endogenous regulators of ethylene biosynthesis in the control of plant development, response to stress or fruit ripening. because tomato has at least one eto <dig> ortholog , a family of acs isozymes and many ethylene-related phenotypes, we tested whether eto <dig> could interact with and inhibit members of the acc synthase family from tomato. we showed that eto <dig> specifically interacts with two type  <dig> acc synthases, atacs <dig> and le-acs <dig>  but not with le-acs <dig>  or le-acs <dig>  in the yeast two-hybrid system. furthermore, we demonstrated that overexpression of the eto <dig> transgene posttranscriptionally suppresses the activity of le-acs <dig> in a heterologous plant. these results suggest that type  <dig> acc synthases represent a group that specifically interact with and are inhibited by eto <dig> family proteins . whether the inhibitory effect of the eto <dig> family in planta is limited to type  <dig> is still unknown; we have not yet checked the interaction of eto <dig> with le-acs <dig> and le-acs <dig> in planta. in the yeast two-hybrid system, the interaction of eto <dig> was obviously restricted to type  <dig> isozymes. however, in planta, atmpk6-dependent phosphorylation of atacs <dig>  can stabilize this isozyme and increase ethylene biosynthesis  <cit> . phosphorylation of such kind of modification of type  <dig> acc synthases may confer an ability to interact with eto <dig>  <cit> . also, a calcium-dependent phosphorylation of the serine residue within the rlsf motif of le-acs <dig>  <cit> , or any proteolytic cleavage  <cit>  may change the c-terminal conformation and enable interaction with the eto <dig> family. these possibilities may be elucidated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments using antibodies that can distinguish phosphorylated from nonphosphorylated forms of type  <dig> acs, or pull-down assay using type-1-specific c-terminal peptide. in contrast, type  <dig> acc synthases does not contain this potential phosphorylation site, suggesting that they may not be similarly regulated. the ctr- phenotype of plants constitutively expressing the c-terminally truncated version of atacs <dig>  <cit>  supports this hypothesis.

another question is whether any other members of the eto <dig> family interact with other types of acc synthases. in the yeast two-hybrid system, both of the two paralogs of eto <dig>  eol <dig> and eol <dig>  showed an interaction with acc synthases from tomato similar to that of eto <dig> . this suggests that type-2-specific regulation may be common to other members of the eto <dig> family at least in yeast cells. however, a possibility that any eol proteins may interact with and inhibit acc synthases other than type  <dig> isozymes modified in planta is still not excluded.

c-terminal sequence specific to type  <dig> acs is a target of eto1
the c-terminal amino acid sequence specific to type  <dig> acs , is a target of eto <dig>  in addition, mutations found within the rlsf to the r/d/e-rich region of atacs <dig> of eto2- <dig> and the wvf motif of atacs <dig> of the eto <dig> mutant  <cit>  strongly implicate the importance of this amino acid sequence. among molecular lesions of arabidopsis eto <dig> mutations identified so far, eto1- <dig>  which lacks only the last tpr motif, has a phenotype similar to the other alleles, and a c-terminal deletion mutant of eto <dig>  impaired in its last tpr motif failed to interact with atacs <dig> in the yeast two-hybrid assay  <cit> . these results indicate that tpr motifs of eto <dig> are essential for interaction with atacs <dig> 

tpr motifs are involved in various protein-protein interactions. generally, the interaction between tpr domains and their target peptide are strictly limited by both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions  <cit> . in this regard, type-2-specific c-termini of acc synthases have some features required for the strict interaction with the tpr of eto <dig>  the crystal structure of le-acs <dig> has been determined, and the c-terminal tail of le-acs <dig> seems to protrude from the surface of the acs monomer and dimer  <cit> . in the dimeric form  of le-acs <dig>  n-terminal residues 11– <dig> make contact with the c-terminal helix h <dig> just before the c-terminal tail. the significance of the interaction between the n- and the c-termini is not clear but may be important for conformation stabilization and catalysis, as suggested by biochemical studies  <cit> . the wvf motif is likely located outside this n- and c-terminal interaction region and may be important for formation of the interacting surface with eto <dig>  crystal structure analysis of the eto1-acs complex would reveal the significance of the wvf motif. also, an isozyme of type  <dig> acs, le-acs <dig>  does not possess the precise wvf sequence. instead, it contains wgf, which is very closely related to wvf . in contrast to the eto <dig> version of atacs <dig>  in which the valine residue of the wvf motif was altered to the charged aspartic acid residue, the glycine residue in the c-terminus of le-acs <dig> is a neutral amino acid. therefore, it is likely that le-acs <dig> may also interact with eto <dig> as do other type  <dig> isozymes.

posttranslational regulation of ethylene biosynthesis
we have identified many orthologous sequences of eto <dig> from other plant species including tomato, suggesting that the eto1-based regulatory system is common among the plant kingdom. in the present study, we showed that arabidopsis eto <dig> interacts with and posttranscriptionally regulates le-acs <dig>  a type  <dig> acs, in a heterologous plant, tomato. this indicates that the eto <dig> protein family is a common component in the negative regulation of ethylene biosynthesis in plants. given that eto1-homologous sequences are found in all plants but not in animals or prokaryotes, this system of regulation of ethylene may have developed early in plant evolution. acc synthases are similar to the subgroup i family of pyridoxal 5-phosphate -dependent aminotransferases  <cit> . most of the similarity between these two families is found around the active sites, while the target of eto <dig> lies in the c-terminus of acs, which is outside the conserved region. it is an intriguing question as to how early plants acquired this unique mechanism to regulate ethylene biosynthesis.

finally, one may ask why only type  <dig> acc synthases are regulated by eto <dig>  it is imperative for plants to have ethylene synthesized in a timely manner. for instance, a remarkable phenotype of all eto mutants was observed in the etiolated seedling stage, suggesting that production of ethylene is regulated by eto <dig> during germination. although ethylene evolution is important for germination, seedlings with excessive level of ethylene for an extended time would continue to exhibit phenotype similar to that of the triple response, which is normally disappeared after germination. also ethylene is important to respond to various stresses. to avoid unnecessary overproduction of ethylene in physiological and developmental processes, a tightly regulated system consisted of the type  <dig> acc synthases and eto <dig> protein family together with yet unknown system  must have been evolved in plants to timely control ethylene biosynthesis until this important growth regulator and stress phytohormone is needed.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we elucidated the substrate specificity of eto <dig> protein. we showed the interaction between eto <dig> and acs protein family is restricted to type  <dig> acs isozymes which possess specific c-terminal amino acid sequences. our data that eto <dig> suppress auxin-induced ethylene evolution through induction of le-acs <dig> also show that arabidopsis eto <dig> can regulate type  <dig> acs in a heterologous plant.
