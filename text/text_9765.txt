BACKGROUND
rt-qpcr is a simple, fast, cost-effective and sensitive technique that has been extensively used in cancer research. in the field of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma , rt-qpcr has mainly been used to identify gene regulation in tissue from the upper aerodigestive tract induced by conditions such as cancer or drug, alcohol and tobacco use. from a clinical point of view, this approach aims to discover transcriptional alterations that can be used for diagnosis, classification and/or prognosis  <cit> . among the pitfalls of this measuring tool, the normalization step is certainly one of the most debated  <cit> . rt-qpcr normalization procedures have been developed in order to minimize inter-sample variability due to technical artifacts such as flaws in rna concentration assessment or the handling process, as well as variable retro-transcription efficiency  <cit> . the vast majority of rt-qpcr studies rely on the measurement of internal control genes, called housekeeping genes or reference genes, simultaneously with the genes of interest. since the reference genes are exposed to the same preparation steps as the genes of interest, this normalization adjusts for differences in amount and quality of starting material  <cit> . a perfect reference gene should have a steady expression in different tested tissues and should not be regulated by physiological or pathological mechanisms or by external causes. unfortunately, it has been clearly demonstrated that a universal reference gene does not exist and that even housekeeping gene expression can be influenced by cellular processes like differentiation, cell cycle, and cancer progression, or modulated by external factors such as drugs, radiotherapy and hormonal changes  <cit> . despite this evidence, which highlights the importance of validating a potential reference gene for each specific experimental condition, most rt-qpcr studies employ arbitrarily selected endogenous genes without proper validation of their presumed stability of expression. this negligence could lead to systematic false measurements and, consequently, to erroneous conclusions  <cit> .

the systematic study of the suitability of reference genes for rt-qpcr normalization in the field of hnscc has thus far been lacking. we thus aimed to test the appropriateness of  <dig> commonly used reference genes  for rt-qpcr normalization. we evaluated their expression stability in hnscc and matched normal mucosa and we looked at potential differential regulation between clinically relevant subgroups . because the use of at least two reference genes is recommended, we indicate for each tissue subgroup the best combination of two genes that should be privileged  <cit> .

RESULTS
raw cp values of reference genes
the median expression range of the  <dig> tested genes was calculated from raw cp values and spanned  <dig>  cycles for act to  <dig>  cycles for tbp. as presented in figure  <dig>  expression levels of alas, hmbs, rps <dig> and tbp were low, with median cp values between  <dig> and  <dig> cycles. hprt, kalpha and shad displayed intermediate expression levels with median cp values between  <dig> and  <dig> cycles. in contrast, high expression of act, b2m, gapdh, rps <dig> and rpl <dig> was detected, with cp values between  <dig> and  <dig> cycles. among the  <dig> genes, the maximum and minimum expression range was  <dig>  cycles for kalpha and  <dig>  for gapdh, respectively.

reference gene expression stability in the pool of hnscc plus normal mucosa samples
we first studied the inter-sample stability of reference gene expression in the pool of hnscc plus normal mucosa samples. using genorm software, we found that m values for all  <dig> studied genes were falling below the  <dig>  threshold, under which a gene is considered suitable for normalization by this program. the best combination of two genes for normalization was gapdh with shad, an association that reached a  <dig>  m value. as presented in figure  <dig>  when samples were considered independently using the normfinder software, we found exactly the same ranking as with genorm. when tumor and normal tissues were taken into consideration using the normfinder pairing option, we observed slight modifications in gene stability ranking, but gapdh and shad remained the two best single normalization genes and their association was still the best combination of two genes, with a  <dig>  stability value.

reference gene expression stability in hnscc and normal mucosa separately
we then applied stability tests to hnscc and normal samples separately in order to identify differences with the whole sample group. in both types of tissue, m values provided by genorm were still under the  <dig>  cut-off for the  <dig> genes. interestingly, the four best normalization genes in both groups given by genorm as well as normfinder were alas, gapdh, rps <dig> and shad. similarly, the four worst genes were act, kalpha, rpl <dig> and rps <dig>  in the hnscc group, the best combination of two genes was gapdh and shad with an m value of  <dig> . in the normal mucosa group, the best combination of two genes was gapdh and rps <dig> with an m value of  <dig> , followed by gapdh and shad with an m value of  <dig> .

reference gene expression stability in hnscc subgroups: t and n stage
more variable results were observed when stability tests were applied to hnscc subgroups. in the t stage subgroup, both genorm and normfinder found kalpha and tbp to be the two most stable genes for normalization of t1-t <dig> tumors, while rpl <dig> and shad were the most stable for t3-t <dig> tumors. in the n stage subgroup, both genorm and normfinder found kalpha and shad to be the two most stable genes for n <dig> tumors and alas and tbp for n+ tumors. it is worth noting that rpl <dig> was considered by genorm as unsuitable for normalization in t1-t <dig> and n <dig> hnscc subgroups, with an m value > <dig> .

reference gene expression compared in hnscc and normal matched mucosa
as genorm and normfinder are not able to address the specific issue of inter-group comparison, we statistically evaluated the relative expression levels in hnscc and normal matched tissue for the  <dig> patients. as presented in table  <dig>  relative mrna expression levels were significantly higher in tumors than in normal samples for b2m, gapdh, hmbs, hprt, kalpha, rps <dig> and tbp . these expression levels were lower in tumor than in normal samples for act and rps <dig> . as presented in figure  <dig>  it should be noted that the median expression ratio between tumor tissue and matched normal mucosa was very low with a maximum over-expression of  <dig> -fold for act and rps <dig> and a maximum expression decrease of  <dig> -fold for gapdh and hprt.

median, minimum and maximum relative gene expression ratios of  <dig> reference genes in hnscc tissue versus normal tissue are presented with corresponding p-values . rescaled values provided by qbase software are presented.

comparison of reference gene expression in t1-t <dig> and t3-t <dig>  and n <dig> and n+ hnscc
the relative expression levels of the  <dig> genes were compared between t1-t <dig> and t3-t <dig> and between n <dig> and n+ hnscc. no significant difference was shown between these tumor subgroups .

evaluation of the robustness of genorm results by bootstrap technique
we bootstrapped the genorm results to assess their robustness .

for the ranking, the bootstrap results were consistent with those of the original data set. as presented in table  <dig>  shad was ranked the first or second most stable gene in 83% of the  <dig>  generated bootstrap samples. gapdh remained the second most stable gene with a ranking of second or third in 56% of the cases. it should be noted that the ranking of some genes was highly affected by the bootstrap procedure. for instance, rpl <dig> was ranked the second most stable gene in 15% of the cases, but it was also ranked twelfth and the least stable gene in 38% of the cases. these results underscore the fact that gene ranking is not an absolute means to select the most stable gene, particularly when stability results are not very different, which was the case for our set of  <dig> genes.


                              total
this table presents for each gene the frequencies  of ranking between the first and the twelfth position for the  <dig>  iterations of genorm bootstrap.

we observed that median m values  were falling under the  <dig>  threshold for all  <dig> genes. surprisingly, rpl <dig>  had the best median m value , whereas shad  had one of the worst median m value . we thus decided to analyze whether some genes presented m values above the  <dig>  cut-off value in some of the  <dig>  bootstrap genorm results. rps  <dig>  tbp, hprt, shad, act and kalpha exhibited m values above this stability threshold in respectively 1%, 5%, 10%, 13%, 15% and 30% of the cases.

discussion
the measurement by rt-qpcr of quantitative transcriptional differences between several physiological or pathological conditions is of great interest for clinical applications. the major challenge of this mrna quantization is the variability introduced at each step of the procedure by experimental errors or approximation and by variable enzymatic activity. to date, the most commonly used strategy to deal with this problem has been the normalization of raw data by at least one internal reference gene, so-called reference gene  <cit> . the pitfall of this approach is that no universal reference gene exists since many of them are regulated in several conditions, which may lead to altered findings and wrong experimental conclusions. it has been emphasized that researchers need to choose the most appropriate reference gene for a given tissue or disease, and should therefore prove the suitability of these genes in each specific experimental situation  <cit> .

in the field of hnscc, this study is the first one that aimed to select suitable reference genes for the normalization of rt-qpcr studies based on the analysis of human tissue. a similar approach was employed in other types of cancer , but the present work is particularly notable for the number of selected genes, number of paired samples, rigorous quality control and biostatistical analyses  <cit> .

two parameters are key to evaluating the expression stability of reference genes: inter-sample stability and inter-group stability  <cit> .

first, we assessed the theoretical inter-sample expression stability of the  <dig> studied genes using two popular, dedicated software programs: genorm and normfinder. we used this approach for the sample group treated as a whole, as well as for the clinically relevant subgroups , since quantitative expression studies frequently include one of these subgroups to address specific clinical issues. we found that the  <dig> candidate genes could be considered as stable enough for normalization purposes, except for rpl <dig> in t1-t <dig> or n <dig> stage tumors. moreover, the results given by both software programs were highly comparable. although the stability values were very close, some of the  <dig> genes appeared to be more stable than others and should probably be used as a priority . previous data suggested that at least two reference genes should be associated for accurate normalization  <cit> , and our results clearly showed that indeed, the association of two genes dramatically improved the stability values, and that gapdh-shad appeared to be the best association for hnscc studies.

in the literature, more or less sophisticated strategies have been proposed to assess the inter-sample expression stability of reference genes  <cit> . since no universal reference point is available, these methods are all based on averaged cross-comparisons of the expression level of all genes in all measured samples. this principle is certainly relevant but has its own limitations. indeed, the results greatly depend on the choice of sample and on the genes introduced into the analyses. moreover, the reliability of results provided by genorm and normfinder is questionable, notably because these programs do not include a statistical evaluation of these results. we thus decided to bootstrap the results of genorm, in order to test their robustness  <cit> . although the bootstrap results were globally consistent with the original data set, this statistical procedure confirmed that stability values and gene ranking are highly altered by some changes in the original dataset. moreover, lyng et al and andersen et al emphasized that, for a given gene, the stability values reported by genorm or normfinder depend on the genes with which it is compared, and that co-regulations could lead to falsely good stability results  <cit> . thus, results provided by these software programs should be considered as trends and should probably not be generalized without proper validation.

second, we tested the inter-group stability by looking at possible differential regulation of our  <dig> candidates between clinically relevant subgroups: hnscc versus normal matched mucosa, t1-t <dig> versus t3-t <dig> and n <dig> versus n+. theoretically, the expression level of a reference gene should not be influenced by the experimental conditions, and some authors consider such regulated genes as irrelevant for normalization  <cit> . in our study, we found that nine out of  <dig> reference genes were differentially expressed between hnscc and normal mucosa. this result was not in accordance with the good stability values obtained not only with genorm but also with normfinder, which is supposed to take into consideration the inter-group comparison. to resolve this ambiguity, a distinction between statistically and clinically different expressions should be made. we think that a regulated gene can be used as a reference gene for normalization, depending on the resolution of the assay. statistically, regulated reference genes are acceptable for normalization if the magnitude of this regulation is clinically lower than the clinically relevant regulation that is to be measured. for instance, in this study we observed very weak regulations  that were statistically significant. from a clinical point of view, these regulations are not actually significant, since most rt-qpcr studies require the detection of at least ten-fold expression differences for clinical applicability like huggett et al. and toegel et al., we recommend the search for reference gene regulations and specification of their magnitude for any expression comparison between two sample groups  <cit> . once the variation of the reference gene is known, the resolution of the rt-qpcr assay can be determined. inversely, the choice of reference gene can be determined by the degree of resolution required for the assay. if the goal of a rt-qpcr study is to detect global gene expression differences between two groups, a  <dig> log systematic bias introduced by the use of a regulated reference gene is not recommended, but does not preclude the detection of  <dig> log regulation of a gene of interest. if the goal is to precisely measure the magnitude of gene expression difference between two groups, even faintly regulated genes should be avoided for normalization.

CONCLUSIONS
today, a rational basis for choosing reference genes is needed for quantitative expression studies. here, we present the first study that analyzes the suitability of  <dig> reference genes in the field of hnscc. this study offers a large choice of suitable reference genes, among which research teams can choose depending on the specific setting of their experiments.

in tumor tissue and/or normal mucosa, the four best normalization genes are alas, gapdh, rps <dig> and shad and the most stable combination of two genes is gapdh-shad. kalpha-tbp is recommended for the study of t1-t <dig> tumors, rpl27-shad for t3-t <dig> tumors, kalpha-shad for n <dig> tumors and alas-tbp for n+ tumors.

act, b2m, gapdh, hmbs, hprt, kalpha, rps <dig>  rps <dig> and tbp are slightly misregulated  between tumor and normal mucosa. nonetheless, they can be used for normalization depending on the resolution required for the assay.
