BACKGROUND
the family cichlidae is one of the most species-rich families of vertebrates  <cit> . more than  <dig>  species of cichlid fishes are distributed from central and south america, through africa and madagascar, to southern india  <cit> . although cichlids are diverse and dominant components of the freshwater fauna of both the old and new worlds, it is in the lakes of east africa that they have undergone the spectacular adaptive radiations for which the group is best known  <cit> . cichlids are an emerging model system for studying a broad range of questions at the interface of organismal biology and genomics  <cit> .

tilapias  are cichlid fishes which have become one of the most important species in global aquaculture. native to africa, several species of tilapia have been introduced to tropical areas of asia and the americas to increase supplies of animal protein. world aquaculture production of tilapia is second only to carp, and now exceeds  <dig>  million tons per year  <cit> .

the nile tilapia  genome contains  <dig>  gigabase pairs distributed over  <dig> chromosome pairs  <cit> . several partial genetic linkage maps of tilapia have been produced  <cit> . the latest and most complete map orders  <dig> loci in  <dig> linkage groups spanning a total of  <dig> cm  <cit> .

here we present a physical map of the tilapia genome based on restriction fingerprints of more than  <dig>  large-insert bacterial artificial chromosome  clones. this physical map will help speed positional cloning in tilapia, and will facilitate the long-range assembly of a tilapia genome sequence.

RESULTS
bac fingerprinting
we processed  <dig>  clones from libraries  <dig> and  <dig>  and obtained valid fingerprints from a total of  <dig>  clones . library  <dig> has an average insert size of  <dig> kb, and produced an average of  <dig>  valid bands per clone. library  <dig> has an average insert size of  <dig> kb, and produced an average of  <dig>  bands per clone. figure  <dig> shows the regression of fingerprint band number on clone insert size. together, the fingerprinted clones represent an estimated  <dig> -fold coverage of the tilapia genome.

contig assembly
contigs were assembled from the fingerprint data using the computer program fpc version  <dig>   <cit> . we estimated the sizing accuracy of the capillary sequencer by analyzing the size of the vector band in  <dig> clones. the mean size was  <dig> , with a standard deviation of Â±  <dig>  bp. we therefore multiplied all fragments sizes by  <dig>  and used a fixed tolerance of  <dig>  corresponding to  <dig>  bp, in the fpc analysis.

using a cutoff stringency of 1e- <dig>  the number of contigs reached a plateau of approximately  <dig>  after  <dig>  clones had been fingerprinted. the number of contigs reached a maximum of  <dig>  contigs at  <dig>  clones, and dropped to  <dig>  contigs in the final analysis of  <dig>  clones . a total of  <dig>  clones  were placed in contigs. only  <dig>  clones remained as singletons .

the contigs contain an average of  <dig>  clones each, and had an average estimated length of  <dig>  kb. the assembled contigs have an estimated length of  <dig> gb, or about  <dig> x the genome length. half of the total assembly length is in the largest  <dig>  contigs. the top half of the contigs  contained 69% of the total length of the assembly.

contig reliability
we used several different approaches to assess contig reliability. the first was to determine the stability of contigs at different cutoff values. increasing the stringency of assembly, from 1e- <dig> to 1e- <dig>  increased the number of contigs from  <dig>  to  <dig> . this means that approximately  <dig> contigs were split at the higher stringency, which is less than 5% of initial total.

fpc identified a total of  <dig>  questionable clones  in the assembly, an average of  <dig>  q's per contig. however, the distribution was strongly skewed from poisson expectations.  <dig>  contigs  had no q's called. most of the questionable clones were in a few large contigs . more than half of the q's were in the  <dig> contigs with  <dig> or more questionable clones. since the number of q's was strongly correlated with the number of clones in the contig , we suspect this represents improper assembly of clones containing repetitive sequences.

cichlid fishes have an expanded set of opsin genes relative to tetrapods. changes in the expression of these genes are responsible for differences in visual sensitivity among species  <cit> . in order to identify the regulatory regions for these genes, we isolated bac contigs containing opsin genes. pcr screening of pooled bac dnas identified clones containing the sws <dig>  rh <dig> and lws genes. the fpc database was then used to identify overlapping bacs at a tolerance of  <dig> and cutoff threshold of 1e- <dig>  the sws <dig> contig contained six clones, all of which were positive for the sws gene by pcr. the rh <dig> contig contained  <dig> clones,  <dig> of which were positive for the rh <dig> gene. probes derived from end sequencing of these bacs were used to verify that the remaining  <dig> clones were members of a genuine contig. the lws contig contained  <dig> clones,  <dig> of which contained the lws gene. probes developed from the end sequences of these clones verified that four of the remaining five clones were members of an overlapping contig. the fifth clone should not have been included in this contig. the genes in this contig are homologous to the sws <dig> and lws genes located on scaffold  <dig> of fugu assembly version  <dig> . two of the six bac end sequences derived from the tilapia contig had blast hits to fugu scaffold  <dig>  providing strong evidence for homology of this contig to a  <dig> kb region of the fugu genome.

finally, in the course of positional cloning a mutation for red body color in tilapia, we identified a bac containing the tyrosinase-related protein  <dig>  gene. using a reduced fpc stringency  this bac was near one end of a contig of  <dig> clones which is estimated to span  <dig>  mb. an rflp was identified from a clone at the opposite end of this contig, and was mapped 3cm from trp <dig> in a large f <dig> progeny . this result emphasizes the utility of the fingerprint database, even at reduced stringencies of assembly.

CONCLUSIONS
east african cichlid fishes, including the tilapias as well as the closely related and highly diverse haplochromine cichlids, constitute more than 5% of vertebrate species. an international consortium has come together to develop genomic tools for studying these fishes . resources already developed include a genetic map with more than  <dig> microsatellite markers  <cit> , and a collection of more than  <dig>  ests  <cit> .

the physical map described in this paper is a further step in building the infrastructure to support complete sequencing of the cichlid genome. fingerprinting of additional clones from these libraries would undoubtedly allow further coalescence of contigs, but it is not clear how cost-effective this approach would be. the current set of  <dig> contigs is a manageable number for anchoring to physical and comparative maps. a logical next step in this research would be analysis of the gene content of these contigs to relate the contigs to the sequences of other fish genomes. in the meantime, the physical map will facilitate the positional cloning of genes controlling economically important traits in tilapia, as well as the genes underlying the spectacular adaptive radiation of cichlids in the lakes of east africa.
