BACKGROUND
catenin  is a gene family that links the transmembrane protein cadherin to the cytoskeleton and functions in cell-cell adhesion  <cit> . the catenin family is composed of three subfamilies; p <dig> subfamily, beta subfamily and alpha subfamily. the p <dig> subfamily includes seven members, which are p <dig> , armadillo repeat protein deleted in velo-cardio-facial syndrome , delta <dig> catenin , plakophilin   <dig> , pkp <dig>  pkp <dig>  and pkp <dig>  <cit> . the beta subfamily includes gamma catenin  in addition to beta catenin  <cit> . the alpha subfamily includes alpha <dig> catenin , alpha <dig> catenin  and alpha <dig> catenin   <cit> .

the biomolecular functions and evolutionary history for the catenin family have not been well studied except for beta catenin  <cit> . beta catenin functions in both cadherin-associated cell adhesion  and wnt signaling pathways. this subfamily participates in development and human diseases such as cancer  <cit> . previous evolutionary analyses demonstrate that gamma catenin duplicated from beta catenin in vertebrates and there have been two separate beta catenin duplications specific to caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> . gamma  and the four plakophilins are all components of the desmosome  <cit> . previous studies have also shown a relationship between p <dig> and human cancer  <cit> , while limited evolutionary information has been revealed for the p <dig> subfamily  <cit> . the detailed functions and histories of the p <dig> and alpha subfamilies, however, have not yet been extensively studied. thus evolutionary studies for the whole catenin family seem appropriate given the sufficient amount of metazoan sequence data currently available and the interest of the biomedical community in the catenin family. additionally, the availability of the genomic sequence from the premetazoan unicellular choanoflagellate monosiga brevicollis  <cit>  enables us to make inferences about the catenin family before the emergence of metazoans.

in the present study, we analyzed the gene presence/absence for members of the catenin family from fully sequenced representative metazoans by searching public databases and applying species-specific blast searches. all three subfamilies  are present in all metazoan species analyzed here. this implies that the last common ancestor of metazoans had all three catenin subfamilies, but members of catenin subfamilies have duplicated at different points in evolutionary history. we applied bayesian phylogenetic analysis for the p <dig> and beta subfamilies together, and each of the three catenin subfamilies separately. the results demonstrate that p <dig> and beta catenins form monophyletic groups and that catenins have undergone multiple duplications at different levels  and to different extents .

our bioinformatics and evolutionary analyses have also helped to resolve some existing annotation issues associated with catenin members in both vertebrates and non-vertebrates  <cit> . the annotation issues include wrong annotations, confusing annotations , and hypothetical annotations. confusing or hypothetical annotations for unknown genes or gene families exist because they have not been functionally well characterized. wrong annotations occur frequently in highly similar or highly divergent homologs, since it is hard to resolve annotation by sequence information alone  <cit> . thus, the application of evolutionary analyses to the annotation of new sequences in large gene families can hold considerable value.

RESULTS
origins of the catenin subfamily members during metazoan evolution
in figure  <dig>  green shaded boxes in the table indicate the presence of catenin family members detected in the representative organisms from the species tree. the distribution demonstrates that all three subfamilies have been detected in all the selected metazoan species but not in the premetazoan m. brevicollis. furthermore, we performed presence/absence analyses to other non-metazoans including the amoeba dictyostelium discoideum, the protist cryptosporidium parvum, three fungi , three unicellular algae , and the plant arabidopsis. none of the catenin members have been detected in the above non-metazoans. we infer that these three catenin subfamilies were therefore present in the last common ancestor of metazoans, but none were present in non-metazoans. all members of the p <dig> subfamily except arvcf and delta <dig> are present in only vertebrates. this scenario also holds for gamma catenin from the beta subfamily and alpha <dig> catenin from the alpha subfamily. the annotation of the catenin members in non-vertebrates is based on extensive analyses and discussed in the annotation section.

we further extended presence/absence analyses to other non-catenin gene families involved in desmosome formation. these included both desmosomal cadherins desmogleins and desmocollins, as well as desmoplakins. all of these genes have been detected only in vertebrates but not detected in non-vertebrates.

evolution of an ancient duplication in the catenin family
origins and duplications of p <dig> subfamily members
our analyses suggest that the seven members of the p <dig> subfamily in vertebrates emerged by non-contemporaneous duplication events but the majority of these subfamily members  occurred with the origin of vertebrates. delta <dig> and arvcf diverged with the origin of chordates while p <dig> duplicated from arvcf with the origin of vertebrates and pkp <dig> duplicated from delta <dig> catenin with the origin of vertebrates. it is unclear exactly which member of the p <dig> subfamily pkp <dig>  pkp <dig> and pkp <dig> duplicated from since this monophyletic group does not confidently clade with either arvcf or delta <dig> from the urochordate. we can assume, however, that pkp <dig>  pkp <dig> and pkp <dig> ultimately evolved from delta2/arvcf because the ancestor of chordates appears to have had only one p <dig> member .

in addition to vertebrate-specific subphylum and chordate-specific phylum duplications, the p <dig> subfamily may have undergone species-specific duplications in cnidaria. we cannot rule out the possibility that this duplication occurred at a higher level since only a single cnidarian species was incorporated in our analyses. support of the former scenario, however, comes from an analysis of two truncated p <dig> subfamily homologs from hydra . a phylogenetic analysis groups the two sea anemone delta2/arvcf as a monophyletic clade to the exclusion of the two delta2/arvcf from hydra that also form a monophyletic clade . it is possible that delta2/arvcf has undergone species-specific duplications in sea anemone and hydra separately, but a more confident conclusion will depend on complete sequences from hydra and/or the availability of sequences from other cnidarians.

in total, all p <dig> subfamily members share a common ancestor with delta2/arvcf from non-chordates. this subfamily experienced multiple vertebrate-specific subphylum duplications, a single chordate-specific phylum duplication and possible species-specific duplications in the cnidaria phylum.

origins and duplications of beta subfamily members
in addition to a vertebrate-specific subphylum duplication, the beta subfamily has undergone species-specific and phylum-specific duplications. figure  <dig> shows that in the nematoda phylum, three monophyletic clades are formed by bar <dig>  wrm <dig>  and hmp <dig> separately , suggesting two nematoda-specific phylum duplications. however, only two of the four species  studied here contain the complete three beta catenin paralogs, while pristionchus and brugia seem to have lost wrm <dig>  additionally, brugia contains two beta paralogs  within the bar <dig> clade, indicating a brugia species-specific duplication within the nematoda phylum. thus the beta subfamily has undergone a species-specific duplication in brugia and two phylum-specific duplications.

for the arthropoda phylum, two monophyletic clades  are formed from two individual species-specific duplications in the pea aphid and the body louse. each group is the result of a single duplication resulting in two paralogs. beetle also contains what appears to be a species-specific duplication but the paralogs do not group together so we cannot rule out an ancient origin for this duplication. as for the cnidaria phylum, we have found two beta catenin homologs in sea anemone and only one in hydra. we only show one beta catenin  for sea anemone in figure  <dig> since the other potential paralog  has been truncated to  <dig> aa, and this short length makes it hard to resolve the phylogenetic position for this paralog. the potential presence of two beta catenin homologs in sea anemone indicates a possible species-specific duplication in the cnidaria phylum.

in total, all beta subfamily members share a common ancestor with beta catenin from non-vertebrates. this subfamily experienced a vertebrate-specific subphylum duplication, two nematode-specific phylum duplications, a species-specific duplication in the nematoda phylum, multiple species-specific duplications in the arthropoda phylum and a possible species-specific duplication in the cnidaria phylum. the conflict between the gene tree of the beta subfamily and the species tree of metazoan evolution for the position of the urochordate sea squirt is caused by a combination of slow evolution outside the nematode clade and rapid evolution inside the nematode clade . this difference in evolutionary rates is supported by wilcoxon rank and kolmogorov-smirnov tests, both with p values <  <dig> .

origins and duplications of alpha subfamily members
the alpha subfamily has not experienced extensive duplication events similar to the p <dig> and beta subfamilies. thus, the evolutionary history of this gene subfamily is easier to resolve. additional file  <dig> shows that alpha <dig> and alpha <dig> in vertebrates form two monophyletic clades  and together form a clade  to the exclusion of alpha <dig> - forming its own monophyletic clade . the two vertebrate-specific and one amniote-specific alphas form a monophyletic clade with all non-vertebrate alphas positioned outside the clade. our analyses suggest alpha <dig> duplicated from alpha <dig> with the origin of vertebrates. it is unclear exactly which member of the alpha subfamily alpha <dig> duplicated from since this monophyletic group does not confidently clade with either alpha <dig> or alpha <dig> from vertebrates. we can assume, however, that alpha <dig> ultimately evolved from alpha <dig> because the ancestor of vertebrates appears to have had only one alpha member . our results show that the alpha subfamily experienced a vertebrate-specific subphylum duplication and an amniote-specific duplication. in total, all alpha subfamily members share a common ancestor with alpha <dig> from non-vertebrates.

annotation issues for the catenin family
our evolutionary studies have resolved annotation issues in all three catenin subfamilies  and have allowed us to identify nomenclature of catenin genes present before the diversification of vertebrates. some issues are similar between subfamilies while other issues are unique to specific subfamilies.

the urochordate sea squirt contains a p <dig> subfamily homolog that has been annotated as 'p120'. our analysis shows that the sea squirt sequence annotated as p <dig> is slightly more similar in sequence identity to arvcf members in vertebrates  than p <dig> members in vertebrates . we therefore had to perform additional analyses to resolve this ambiguity. first, a blastp search using this sea squirt 'p120/arvcf' as the query against only p120s and arvcfs from vertebrates was carried out. this analysis demonstrated that all arvcfs have higher blastp scores  and lower e-values to the sea squirt sequence than the p120s from vertebrates. second, we performed mega pairwise distance comparisons of the sea squirt 'p120/arvcf' to vertebrate p120s and arvcfs using both dayhoff and jtt models . both models gave the same results; the distances between the sea squirt 'p120/arvcf' and the vertebrate arvcfs are shorter than the distances between the sea squirt 'p120/arvcf' and the vertebrate p120s, and this difference in distance is statistically significant  if both human arvcf and p <dig> are removed from the analysis. we extended these analyses to include measures of functional divergence. we used the diverge software package to identify type-ii functional sites  to help resolve the annotation of the sea squirt 'p120/arvcf'. of the  <dig> type-ii sites identified by diverge, 36% of sites  support the annotation of sea squirt as arvcf while only 20%  support the annotation as p <dig>  the remaining sites do not have resolution in favor of one annotation over the other. thus, the blastp, mega and diverge analyses all suggest that the sea squirt 'p120/arvcf' is more similar to the arvcf group than the p <dig> group.

the other p <dig> subfamily homolog in the urochordate sea squirt has been annotated as 'delta2'. given the close relationship between delta <dig> and pkp <dig> , we applied the same analyses used for the sea squirt 'p120/arvcf' to resolve the annotation of the sea squirt 'delta2/pkp4'. both blastp and mega analyses suggest that the sea squirt 'delta2/pkp4' is closer to delta <dig> than pkp <dig>  the mega result is statistically significant as supported by wilcoxon rank and kolmogorov-smirnov tests, both with p values equal to  <dig> . diverge analysis further supported the annotation of the sea squirt sequence as delta <dig>  of the  <dig> type-ii sites identified by diverge, 32% of sites  support the annotation of sea squirt as delta <dig> while only 17%  support the annotation as pkp <dig>  the remaining sites do not have resolution in favor of one annotation over the other. this implies that delta <dig> members evolved prior to the evolution of pkp <dig> members. accordingly, we retain the original annotation of this sea squirt gene as delta <dig> 

in regards to the p <dig> subfamily, only two p <dig> subfamily members are present in the urochordate sea squirt. this indicates they are the two oldest members of this subfamily. bayesian phylogenetic analysis confirmed that all the p <dig> subfamily homologs in non-chordates share a common ancestor with all seven members of the p <dig> subfamily in vertebrates . this phylogeny, however, does not provide conclusive evidence for which of the two oldest p <dig> subfamily members  gave rise to the vertebrate expansion of the subfamily. therefore we performed extensive blastp analyses and series of mega pairwise distance comparisons to infer whether delta <dig> or arvcf may be the more ancient member of the p <dig> subfamily. both blastp and mega analyses suggest that the p <dig> subfamily homologs in non-chordates are closer to delta <dig> than arvcf. this conclusion holds for all vertebrates except when the urochordate sea squirt is included in the analysis, and this is probably caused by rapid evolution as seen from the long branches leading to sea squirt delta <dig> and sea squirt arvcf . the mega analysis, however, is not statistically significant. further, a diverge analysis did not reveal sites that could help resolve the annotation of non-chordate p <dig> subfamily members. as such, it is not possible to apply one particular annotation to the non-chordates over another annotation.

our analyses point to a delta2/arvcf origin for the entire p <dig> subfamily since only delta <dig> or arvcf is inferred to exist in non-chordates and the diversification of this subfamily occurred with the evolution of chordates. unfortunately, gene annotation does not follow this pattern. numerous non-chordate homologs in the p <dig> subfamily have been annotated as p <dig>  armadillo repeat protein, plakophilins or fibronectins. to resolve these discrepancies we performed three blastp analyses using the 'mis-annotated' homologs as queries; #1) a blastp search of the non-redundant protein database, #2) a blastp search of the human protein database, and #3) a blastp search of the individual genomes from which the mis-annotated homolog resides. for both analyses # <dig> and # <dig>  all queries resulted in trusted top-hits annotated as p <dig> subfamily members. for analysis # <dig>  only a single homolog was identified in the individual genomes of arthropods and nematodes while searches of the cnidarian genomes retrieved two homologs . we, therefore, annotated all these p <dig> subfamily homologs in non-chordates as delta2/arvcf .

for the beta subfamily, our presence/absence and phylogenetic analyses suggest that gamma catenin is the result of a duplication event from beta catenins that took place during the origin of vertebrates and thus there should not be any gamma catenins present in non-vertebrates. one gene from s. mansoni, however, is annotated as gamma catenin. we performed the same series of three blast searches described above. these analyses suggest that this homolog is neither more similar in sequence to gamma nor beta as it appears to have experienced an episode of rapid evolution along the branch leading to s. mansoni . however, since our presence/absence and phylogenetic analyses suggest that only beta is present in non-vertebrates, we infer that this gene evolved from a beta catenin and has since lost most of the sequence signatures that separate beta from gamma . thus our analyses suggest that this gene arose from a duplication event of beta catenin in s. mansoni and we re-annotated this gamma as beta catenin . aplysia californica is the other species from the same phylum as s. mansoni that has whole genome  sequence available. a blast search of this genome reveals only a single gene belonging to the beta subfamily. this suggests that the paralogs in s. mansoni arose via a species-specific duplication event. in total, our analyses suggest that beta is the most ancient member of this subfamily with gamma arising during the origin of vertebrates while other duplication events have taken place in individual species such as s. mansoni.

for the alpha subfamily, our presence/absence and phylogenetic analyses suggest a vertebrate origin for alpha <dig> catenin. both blastp and mega analyses suggest the alpha subfamily member present in non-chordates is more similar to the alpha <dig> than the alpha <dig> from vertebrates. the mega results are statistically significant as determined using both wilcoxon rank and kolmogorov-smirnov tests . the distance to the arthropod fruit fly, however, was not significant, presumably due to the short branch leading to the fly . our series of three blast analyses identified only a single alpha subfamily homolog in each of the non-vertebrates studied here. thus all alpha subfamily homologs in non-vertebrates should be alpha <dig>  as such, the annotated alpha <dig> in pediculus humanus corporis  would be incorrectly annotated. we propose that members of the alpha subfamily in non-vertebrates be annotated as alpha <dig> .

distant relatives of catenins in non-metazoans
the p <dig> subfamily members have been detected in all metazoans, but not in the premetazoan m. brevicollis or other non-metazoans. however, relatives of this subfamily have been detected in non-metazoans by our blast searches. these included armadillo repeat-containing protein   <dig>  armc <dig>  the importin alpha family, and vac8p.

the beta subfamily members have been detected in all metazoans, but not in the premetazoan m. brevicollis or other non-metazoans. however, several potential beta catenin homologs and beta catenin-like genes have been detected in non-metazoans by blast. these genes included aardvark, vac8p, arabidillo-1/- <dig>  physcodillo-1/- <dig>  and beta-catenin-like.

we did extensive analyses by blastp and bayesian phylogenetics to determine the relationship of distant homologs of both the p <dig> and beta subfamilies. our analyses show that arabidillo-1/- <dig> and physcodillo-1/- <dig> formed a well-supported clade , and aardvark, vac8p, beta-catenin-like, armc <dig>  armc <dig> and importin alpha all form individual monophyletic clades . thus, none of these distant homologs grouped with the beta or p <dig> subfamilies in our phylogenetic analyses.

alpha subfamily members have been detected in all metazoans but not in the premetazoan m. brevicollis. however, a relative of this subfamily  has been detected in the premetazoan m. brevicollis. an additional relative  was detected by our blast analyses but present only in metazoans. bayesian phylogenetic analyses showed that alpha catenins, vinculin and alpha-catulin all formed three monophylogenetic clades .

discussion
origins and evolution for the catenin family
despite similar names, alpha catenins are not homologous to p <dig> and beta catenins. this is evident from sequence and structural comparisons . conversely, this figure shows that beta and p <dig> share a common ancestor as a result of a duplication event prior to the diversification of metazoans. this evolutionary relationship from sequence-based analyses is consistent with the differences in secondary structures between alphas versus p120s/betas. the p <dig> subfamily contains  <dig> arm repeats  <cit>  and the beta subfamily contains  <dig> of these arm repeats  <cit> . the alpha subfamily, however, contains three vinculin homolog domains instead of arm repeats, and belongs to the vinculin superfamily  <cit> . therefore, catenin should not be called a family, since it is just a group of proteins binding c-terminal of classical cadherins. for the p <dig> subfamily, we conclude that it is more appropriate to refer to the p <dig> subfamily as delta. we suspect that this change in nomenclature will be difficult to accept at first  but our proposed change more accurately reflects the evolution of this subfamily and the new nomenclature is more functionally consistent for experimental biologists.

delta <dig> or arvcf is the oldest member of the p <dig> subfamily according to our analyses but we did not detect it in the premetazoan m. brevicollis. this suggests a metazoan origin for the p <dig> subfamily. unlike the p <dig> subfamily, we have detected the relatives of this subfamily beyond metazoans, such as armc <dig>  armc <dig>  the importin alpha family, and vac8p. this suggests that these armadillo repeat proteins share a common ancestor. this can be further inferred by their sequence and structural conservations though they have diverse functions in different kingdoms including animals, fungi and plants  <cit> .

beta catenin is the oldest member of the beta subfamily according to our analyses but we did not detect it in the premetazoan m. brevicollis. this indicates a metazoan origin for the beta subfamily. previous studies also suggested the potential metazoan origin of beta catenin and its involvement in cell adhesion for multicellular organisms  <cit> . several types of genes in non-metazoans, however, have been considered potential beta catenin homologs  <cit>  and thus some have been annotated as beta catenin or beta catenin-like. these genes included aardvark in amoeba, vac8p in fungi and plants, arabidillo-1/- <dig> and physcodillo-1/- <dig> in plants, and beta-catenin-like in both animals and plants. the aardvark gene in amoeba participates in adherens junctions and cell signaling, and it may be the amoeba's version of a precursor to beta catenin  <cit> . vac8p has  <dig> arm repeats and this is close to the  <dig> arms that compose beta catenin  <cit> . none of these potential beta homologs grouped with the beta subfamily in our phylogenetic analyses, thus supporting our hypothesis of a metazoan origin for the beta subfamily.

our analyses also revealed a significantly higher mutation rate within the nematode clade for beta catenin paralogs specific to this clade. the high rate can be correlated to experimental work showing subfunctionalization of cellular adhesion and transcriptional activation  among the three paralogs in c. elegans revealed by their protein-binding partners  <cit> . it remains to be determined whether this is due to relaxation of selective constraints or due to positive selection.

alpha <dig> catenin is the oldest member of the alpha subfamily according to our analyses but we did not detect it in the premetazoan m. brevicollis. this suggests a metazoan origin for the alpha subfamily. we did however detect a vinculin-like gene in the premetazoan m. brevicollis. this suggests that the alpha subfamily duplicated from vinculin-like genes after the separation of metazoans/premetazoans but prior to the diversification of metazoans.

in summary, our analyses did not identify any p <dig>  beta or alpha subfamily members in the premetazoan m. brevicollis. we confirmed this absence by extending our analyses to other non-metazoans such as the amoeba d. discoideum, the protist c. parvum, three fungi , three unicellular algae , and the plant arabidopsis. again, none of these non-metazoans contained a member of the catenin family. we conclude that the catenin family arose during the origin of metazoans while some other armadillo repeat proteins and vinculin-like proteins were present prior to the evolution of metazoans.

evolution-related physiology of the catenin family
the members of the three catenin subfamilies emerged at different points during metazoan evolution. it would be interesting to correlate gene evolution of catenins to the cellular physiology associated with the functional divergence of this gene family.

our results suggest that either delta <dig> or arvcf is the oldest member of the p <dig> subfamily - one evolved with the origins of metazoan while the other evolved with the origins of chordates. pkp <dig>  p <dig>  pkp <dig>  pkp <dig>  and pkp <dig> show vertebrate origins and this is consistent with the conclusions of other analyses  <cit> . functional divergence between delta <dig> and arvcf in chordates is highlighted by delta2's neuron-specific expression while arvcf is ubiquitously expressed  <cit> . both arvcf and p <dig> are ubiquitously expressed in epithelial tissue  <cit> , but their expression is mutually exclusive  <cit>  and have complementary distributions in epithelial adherens junctions as interpreted from biogps  <cit> . our evolutionary studies show that p <dig> duplicated from arvcf during the origin of vertebrates. the origin of p <dig> members appears to coincide with the vertebrate origin of p120's binding partner kaiso  <cit> , a nuclear factor participating in signaling pathways  <cit> . this interaction might relate to epigenetic transcriptional regulation and wnt signaling modulation via methyl-cpg islands  <cit>  and the transcription factor tcf  <cit> , participating in vertebrate-specific development and transcriptional regulation  <cit> . the nuclear signaling functions of arvcf have not yet been identified but it is known that it interacts with the novel protein kazrin localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus  <cit> . p <dig> is unique among the members of the p <dig> subfamily because it interacts in the nucleus with the nuclear transcription repressor glis <dig>  <cit> . this demonstrates that p <dig> has diverged from arvcf due to its unique interaction with glis <dig> and its vertebrate-specific interaction with kaiso, but p <dig> still shares functional redundancy with arvcf since they can rescue one another's null mutants  <cit> . another unique feature of p <dig> is the absence of the c-terminal pdz binding domain. the lack of this domain may enable p <dig> and its binding cadherins to evolve with more flexibility in a pdz-independent manner  <cit> . in support of this view is the observation that the function of delta <dig> catenin in spine density regulation is independent of cadherins but dependent on an interaction with pdz-domain containing proteins while p <dig> regulates spine density using an alternative mechanism that depends on rho gtpases  <cit> .

both p <dig> and arvcf, but neither delta <dig> nor pkp <dig>  have different isoforms that result from alternative splicing at the 5' portion of the transcript  <cit> . translating the conserved n-terminal coiled coil domain during such isoform switching, and in coordination with the dynamic cadherin switching , occurs during the transformation from epithelial and other sessile cell types to mesenchymal  and other motile cell types   <cit> . this process might be important in development, wound healing and cancer  <cit> .

pkp <dig> duplicated from delta <dig> during the origin of vertebrates and both have neuron-specific expression patterns, however this pattern of expression is reciprocal according to biogps. delta <dig> is predominantly expressed in the brain while pkp <dig> is expressed in the brain but also ubiquitously expressed in other tissues. pkp <dig> differs from delta <dig> in that pkp <dig> participates in desmosome formation in addition to adherens junctions according to numerous experimental reports  <cit> , however one study failed to verify this dual functionality  <cit> . pkp <dig>  pkp <dig>  and pkp <dig> are vertebrate-specific and are well known for their functions in desmosomes instead of adherens junctions  <cit> . the origins of these plakophilins appear to coincide with our assumption of the origin of desmosomes in vertebrates since our analyses reveal that other desmosome-specific genes are found only in vertebrates .

our results suggest that beta is the oldest member of the beta subfamily since it is present in all metazoans while gamma is a more recent acquisition since it is found only in vertebrates. both beta and gamma are ubiquitously expressed at basal levels but gamma is uniquely highly-expressed in some tissues such as tongue. beta and gamma both function in the formation of adherens junctions however gamma has functionally diverged from beta since gamma can also participate in desmosome formation  <cit> .

gamma  and the four plakophilins  are all components of the desmosome  <cit>  and all have vertebrate origins according to our analyses. this suggests to us that the desmosome evolved in conjunction with the origin of vertebrates. to further validate this hypothesis we performed computational analyses of other non-catenin gene families involved in desmosome formation. these included both desmosomal cadherins desmogleins and desmocollins, as well as desmoplakins and thus we confirmed that the presence of genes involved in desmosome formation is limited to vertebrates and not observed in non-vertebrates. all of our results are consistent with the observation that desmosome-containing tissues  have evolved with or after the origin of vertebrates.

our results suggest that alpha <dig> is the oldest member of the alpha subfamily since it is present in all metazoans while alpha <dig> is a more recent acquisition since it is found only in vertebrates. alpha <dig> and alpha <dig> display both similar and reciprocal expression and distribution patterns in the dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord at the lumbar level where sciatic nerves originate  <cit> . the two are similar in that they both display brain-specific expression patterns however they display reciprocal expression patterns in terms of the specific types of tissues in the brain  <cit> . unlike alpha <dig>  alpha <dig> functions by binding the nuclear transcription repressor zasc <dig>  <cit> . alpha <dig> knockouts in mice mainly affect the nervous systems by causing cerebellar deficient folia  <cit> . alpha <dig> knockouts in mice are lethal at the blastocyst stage but its knockout mainly affects the epithelial tissues such as skin  <cit> .

alpha <dig> is the most recently evolved member of the alpha subfamily since it is found only in amniotes. the observation that alpha <dig> and alpha <dig> share identical exon-exon boundaries  <cit>  suggests to us that alpha <dig> evolved via a gene duplication of alpha <dig> coinciding with the origin of amniotes. unlike alpha <dig> and alpha <dig>  alpha <dig> interacts with pkp <dig> in the area composita , yet co-expresses with alpha <dig> at intercalated discs of cardiomyocytes  <cit> . we could not find a physiological link between the amniote-specific alpha <dig> and the observation that it is highly expressed in the testis and participates in adherens junctions between sertoli and germ cells, highly expressed in the testis interstitial tissue or highly expressed in peritubular myoid cells of the testis  <cit>  because the above cells or tissues are also found in the non-amniote fish. however, alpha <dig> interacts with 1-adadin and this interaction, along with a truncated isoform of alpha <dig> present in the testis  <cit> , may be unique to spermatogenesis in amniotes. no alpha <dig> knockout experiments have been performed in mice  <cit> .

overall, delta <dig>  alpha <dig> and n-cadherin are present in nearly all metazoans and all are expressed in neural-specific tissues. their vertebrate-counterparts p <dig>  alpha <dig> and e-cadherin, however, are mainly expressed in epithelial tissues in addition to neural tissues. extensive co-evolution exists between the catenin family and their binding partners; these include p <dig> with kaiso, delta2/alpha <dig> with n-cadherin, p120/alpha <dig> with e-cadherin, and pkps/plakoglobin  with desmosomal cadherins.

CONCLUSIONS
the p <dig>  beta and alpha subfamilies are present in all metazoans, but none of the subfamilies are present in non-metazoans. this indicates a metazoan origin for the catenin family. each catenin subfamily has undergone duplications at different levels  and to different extents .

vertebrate-specific duplications occurred in all three subfamilies: p <dig>  pkp <dig>  pkp <dig>  pkp <dig>  and pkp <dig> in the p <dig> subfamily; gamma in the beta subfamily; and alpha <dig> in the alpha subfamily. all three subfamilies had extensive annotation issues and these have been effectively resolved by our studies. we anticipate that this resolution in combination with our evolutionary analyses will make it easier for experimental biologists to correlate diverse catenin physiologies to interesting evolutionary innovations such as the development of multicellularity and the role of adhesion during this development and the evolution of terrestrial organisms and their ability to prevent desiccation.
