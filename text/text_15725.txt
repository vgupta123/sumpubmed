BACKGROUND
citrus is one of the most widespread fruit crops with great economic and health value  <cit> . but citrus is also one of the most difficult plants to improve through traditional breeding approaches due to undesirable reproductive traits and characteristics. these include degrees of sexual sterility and incompatibility, nucellar embryony , extended juvenility, and large plant size, which affect cultural practice in the orchard. to overcome these drawbacks, new genomic approaches are being developed, including generation of linkage maps, markers, and est collections, making possible physical and genetic mapping in citrus. furthermore, an international citrus genomics consortium  has been initiated to generate the full-genome sequence of sweet orange , as well as to sequence other citrus species and varieties  <cit> . prior to the establishment of the icgc, est collections  <cit>  have provided a first glimpse of the citrus genome. over the years, several different groups have contributed to the generation of a total of over  <dig>  citrus sequences currently deposited at the dbest division of the genbank. among these, the spanish citrus genomic project   has made a significant contribution producing  <dig> standard cdna libraries, an est collection of  <dig>  high-quality reads  <cit> , and generating sequence data for over  <dig>  ests from a normalized full-length cdna library and  <dig> additional standard libraries  <cit> . est sequencing along with other gene discovery methods, represent an important initial step towards functional characterization of the genes in the genome.

many methods for the construction of cdna libraries have been developed in recent years. conventional cdna library construction approaches, however, suffer from several major shortcomings. first, the majority of cdna clones are not full-length, especially for mrnas longer than  <dig> kb. this loss of 5'-terminal sequences is typically due to premature termination of reverse transcription or blunt-end polishing of cdna ends prior to subcloning. as a result, cdna 5' ends are significantly underrepresented in cdna libraries. second, an adaptor-mediated cloning process is still a common approach for cdna library construction, leading to up to 20% of undesirable ligation by-products  and inserts of non-mrna origin   <cit> . in recent years, the annotation of genes has been greatly improved by the integration of full-length cdnas produced by the community  <cit> . the importance of isolating full-length cdna clones relies in the "value-added" features lacking in common ests. full-length cdnas define the limits of the transcriptional units and the coding region, and thus identify the immediate upstream basal promoter and enable sequence characterization of 5' and 3' untranslated regions . furthermore, they provide a record of transcript diversity due to modifications of the primary pre-mrna transcript, such as alternate promoter usage, alternative splicing, alternate polyadenylation, and rna editing. on the other hand, cdna libraries rich in full-length clones are a valuable tool for high-throughput gene function analysis  <cit> .

a number of methods have been developed for cdna library preparations enriched in full-length sequences  <cit>  with most of them based on the mrna cap structure  <cit> . these methods require high quantities of starting material  and complicated, multi-step manipulations of the cap structure of mrna and cdna intermediates, which often result in degradation of mrna and isolation of short clones, no longer than  <dig>  kb-long  <cit> . by improving one of these methods, suzuki and co-workers obtained an average size of full-length clones of  <dig>  kb from lower amounts of starting mrna   <cit> . the recently described smart™ method exploits two intrinsic properties of moloney murine leukaemia virus  reverse transcriptase, reverse transcription and template switching, and thus yields larger average orf size  <cit> . moreover, directional cloning has been implemented by using sfii endonuclease, whose variable target sequence allows for designing adaptors with non-complementary ends, thus avoiding their concatenation. as the sfii recognition sequence is very rare in eukaryotic genomes, the use of sfii also eliminates the need for methylation during cdna synthesis  <cit> .

the differential abundance of various transcripts in any particular cell type is a well recognized obstacle for the efficient high-throughput analysis of cdna libraries  <cit> . usually 10- <dig> abundant genes  account for at least 20% of the cellular mrna mass, while several thousand of rare genes  may account for 20-40% of the mrna mass  <cit> . hence, straightforward random sequencing of clones from standard cdna libraries is inefficient for discovering rare transcripts, owing to the repeated occurrence of intermediate and highly abundant cdnas. decreasing the prevalence of clones representing abundant transcripts by normalizing the cdna before sequencing may significantly increase the efficiency of random sequencing and is essential for rare gene discovery  <cit> . the normalization process generally utilizes second-order reaction kinetics of re-association of denatured dna, so that relative transcript concentrations within the remaining single-stranded cdna fraction are equalized to a considerable extent. most of the normalization methods described differ in the process of isolation of the single-stranded  and double-stranded  cdna fractions but typically employ one or more of the following: hydroxylapatite columns, magnetic beads, digestion of the ds-molecules by restriction endonucleases or amplification of the ss fraction using suppression pcr  <cit> . one of the recently described method takes advantage of the properties of a particular nuclease, the dsn from the kamchatka crab, to specifically cleave ds-dna in both dna-dna and dna-rna duplexes, allowing for the separation of the normalized ss-fraction  <cit> . dsn is a thermo-stable enzyme active at 70°c, and therefore, the degradation of the ds-fraction is carried out at the same temperature as the re-naturation of cdna. this helps to avoid a non-specific hybridization of cdna during the dsn treatment and, hence, minimizes the loss of transcripts prone to the formation of secondary structures. the remaining normalized ss-fraction is then amplified using pcr  <cit> . suitable cdna for this procedure should contain known flanking sequences for subsequent pcr amplification. furthermore, to avoid the preference towards shorter products, a process of regulation of average length is recommended  <cit> . the use of this method requires that the adapter sequences form inverted terminal repeats  <cit> .

on the other hand, moving beyond gene discovery to understanding gene function is facilitated by the ability to easily express proteins in both homologous and heterologous biological contexts. the functional analysis of genes typically requires each orf to be over-expressed or silenced, the purification of the expressed protein, production of antibodies, analysis of phenotypes, determination of intracellular localization, and analysis of interactions with other proteins. this entails engineering of multiple expression constructs for every gene of interest, which is time-consuming and laborious when using traditional ligase-mediated cloning, posing a technical barrier for high-throughput functional genomics or proteomics projects  <cit> . hartley and co-workers described a method called recombinational cloning that exploits the accurate and site-specific recombination system utilized by bacteriophage lambda in order to shuttle sequences between plasmids bearing compatible recombination sites  <cit> . this technology, commercially termed gateway™ , bypasses the need for traditional ligase-mediated cloning, provides high specificity and activity, while maintaining orientation of the transferred dna segment and yielding a high proportion of desired clones  <cit> .

we took advantage of the smart™ protocol, the dsn nuclease, and the gateway technology to maximize acquisition of full-length and rarely-expressed cdnas , ready to use for functional analysis purposes. herein, we describe the methods employed to generate a new citrus cdna collection, giving rise to a new set of ests and unigenes. as a direct example of the practical application of our collection, we carried out the overexpression of a full-length cdna clone for the citrsep gene in arabidopsis. the resulting transgenic plants showed early flowering and curly leaves, phenotypes that are consistent with a role of citrsep as a bona fide citrus ortholog of the arabidopsis sep <dig> gene. the protocol utilized in this study has thus been proven to be successful for generating new est collections to improve gene annotation and gene discovery by functional characterization.

RESULTS
full-length and normalized cdna libraries
the spanish citrus genomic project  was initiated with the purpose of functional characterization of citrus genes. it has generated an est collection from standard cdna libraries covering a wide range of tissues and developmental stages, as well as biotic and abiotic stress conditions  <cit> . in addition, cdna microarray platforms have also been created  <cit> . in this work, we wanted to enrich the est collection with the addition of a significant number of full-length cdna clones. with this objective we decided to use the smart™ method, as it allowed us to obtain large ests with few steps and from small quantities of starting rna. furthermore, the subcloning advantages of the gateway system, which allows a captured target sequence to be easily shuttled into a variety of destination vectors, provides great advantages for future functional analyses of the isolated gene. for that reason, we modified the pentr1a vector in order to make it suitable for the directional cloning of citrus cdnas. a detailed description of the construction of the gateway-based pentr-sfii is shown in methods and additional file  <dig>  the engineered pentr-sfii cloning vector proved to be a useful tool for the construction of the cdna libraries as it rendered a very high cloning efficiency and almost all of the clones generated contained cdna inserts introduced in the direct orientation as single inserts .

we constructed a total of  <dig> cdna libraries  using the smart™ method and the engineered gateway-based pentr-sfii cloning vector. in order to increase the proportion of full-length clones, we also performed a size selection of the cdnas, by removing those cdnas that were shorter than  <dig> kb, presumably corresponding to partial cdnas and/or cdnas that could have already been isolated in our standard cdna libraries constructed previously  <cit> . since est collections are hampered by the presence of cdna clones corresponding to highly expressed genes, which limit the probability of isolation of new gene sequences, we decided to include a normalization step in the construction of  <dig> of the cdna libraries to isolate ests corresponding to rare or low-expressed genes. in order to get wide transcriptome coverage, multiple libraries were constructed from leaves, roots, shoots, flowers, ovaries and fruits of different citrus species under different stress or developmental conditions .

since new sequences are to be incorporated with the previous cfgp collection, est assembly was carried out together with the other ests obtained in the cfgp. it revealed that ests from our full-length libraries could be clustered in  <dig> singletons and  <dig> contigs, yielding a total number of  <dig> putative unique transcripts or unigenes . this number of unigenes is probably an overestimation of the number of unique transcripts isolated, as failure to assemble ests from a single transcript can result from alternate splicing, sequence polymorphisms, sequencing errors, and non-overlapping ests. to estimate this internal redundancy, the  <dig> putative unigenes were compared with each other using blastn. sequences with at least 90% nucleotide identity over a minimum of  <dig> bp covering at least 75% of one sequence were assumed to be derived from the same transcript or from different transcripts coming from the same gene , and were therefore clustered in super-contigs . this analysis resulted in  <dig> unigenes remaining as singletons and  <dig> unigenes being clustered in  <dig> super-contigs, indicating that the minimal number of identified expressed genes was  <dig> 

the number of ests per contig ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , while most contigs  contained  <dig> or fewer ests, and only  <dig> contigs  included more than  <dig> est sequences . ests that constitute large clusters partially overlap, thus allowing the reconstitution of the full-length sequence of genes without having to use expensive and labor-intensive primer walking sequencing. these redundant sequences are also a source of single nucleotide polymorphisms  for molecular marker development, and  <dig> contigs were found to have putative snps .

improvement of the previous cfgp citrus est collection
we estimated the contribution of our new est collection to the previous cfgp est collection by calculating the redundancy and novelty of the full-length libraries constructed in this study. table  <dig> shows the distribution per library of the number of ests, singletons, contigs, and unigenes, as well as the absolute and relative values for redundancy and novelty. since we are interested in the optimization of the sequencing effort for the entire project, redundancy for each library was calculated as the percentage of ests in this library that correspond to unigenes already obtained in the whole project. although this number is necessarily higher than redundancy within the library, most libraries  had a level of redundancy below 25%, while in the most redundant library it was higher  but still acceptable. on the other hand, novelty was calculated as the percentage of unigenes in each library that have been isolated only from that particular library . this number represents the level of uniqueness of the library, which can also be considered as an estimation of the capacity of the library to provide new genes to the collection, or gene discovery. the full-length libraries constructed in this study have novelty range of 13-53%, with only  <dig> libraries having a novelty lower than 20% and three of them exceeding 40% . the contribution of the full-length libraries to the whole citrus est collection is therefore indicated by the low levels of redundancy and high percentages of novelty of these libraries. a major advantage of est sequencing from multiple libraries is that it increases the possibility of identifying genes that are putatively transcribed specifically within a certain tissue, during a particular developmental phase, or under some environmental conditions. our analysis indicates that  <dig> unigenes  are specific for the newly constructed libraries, despite the presence of  <dig>  ests in the entire cfgp collection, suggesting the utility of these new libraries.

we also compared the new citrus ests with the ests and unigenes already available in the citrus harvest database, which contains  <dig>  ests. we estimate that the new est collection adds  <dig> new citrus ests representing  <dig> unigenes . in other words, around 20% of ests and 30% of unigenes generated were not previously available in the public database and therefore represent new genes.

genomic coverage of the unigenes identified
we estimated the genomic coverage of the unigenes identified in the present work by comparing their functional distribution to that of a full sequenced plant genome. table  <dig> shows the distribution of the citrus unigenes and arabidopsis genome along the main go functional categories in the 'biological process' ontology. the distribution along the main functional categories in the three different go ontologies is showed in the additional file  <dig>  these results show that the different unigenes obtained are involved in many different categories covering virtually every aspect of plant biology and offer a good representation of the citrus genome.

citrus genes are those reported here and arabidopsis genes are those from tair. data are shown as percentages.

full-length cdna clones
since libraries were constructed using oligo-dt for cdna synthesis and inserts were 5'-end sequenced, we estimated the number of putative full-length cdna clones generated by calculating the number of clones that had blastx matches to proteins of the reference plant arabidopsis that included the first amino acid of the arabidopsis protein . a total of  <dig> unigenes were identified as having putative full-length clones by this method. in most of these cases, the unigene sequence also contains additional sequence upstream of the start codon in the alignment, possibly corresponding to 5'-utr. these putative full-length unigenes represent 63% of the total number of unigenes having matches with arabidopsis proteins , indicating that about  <dig> unigenes  are expected to have at least one full-length cdna clone among their components. however, identification of full-length clones using this approach is a relatively crude method, and these values must be only taken as a rough estimate.

we next investigated the efficiency of the library construction protocol with regard to the enrichment in full-length clones. the comparison with the results for the libraries not enriched in full-length clones clearly indicates that full-length libraries described here produced a considerably higher percentage of full-length unigenes   than the other standard libraries   <cit> . furthermore, full-length estimation by ests instead of unigene sequences emphasized the benefits of the full-length enrichment protocol. while the putative full-length ests in other standard libraries account for 30% to 69% , those in our full-length libraries comprise 67% to 86%  .

efficiency of cdna libraries normalization
most normalization strategies are based on the reaction kinetics of re-association of denatured dna. however, not all of them are amenable to full-length cdna approaches. the most widely used technology for normalization and substraction in large-scale gene discovery relies on the re-association of nucleic acids in amplified plasmid libraries  <cit>  and consequently suffers from cdna-size cloning bias that can lead to under-representation of long cdnas. to avoid the problems related to the amplification of libraries, carninci et al.  <cit>  developed a method to normalize and subtract cdna before cloning. in that method, a biotinylated driver  is employed to detect and eliminate abundant cdnas. however, this method has several drawbacks as it requires high quantities of starting poly rna and is time-consuming  <cit> .

among the different methods employed to separate the normalized ss-cdna fraction we chose normalization with the thermostable dsn nuclease  <cit> . it displays a strong preference for cleaving double-stranded dna and dna in dna-rna hybrid duplexes compared with ss-dna and ss-rna, irrespective of sequence length. due to the thermostable properties of the dsn enzyme, the degradation of the double-stranded fraction is carried out at the same temperature as the re-naturation of cdna. this helps to avoid a non-specific hybridization of cdna during the dsn treatment and, hence, the loss of transcripts which are prone to the formation of secondary structures.

on the other hand, each cdna population requires a specific normalization treatment . those normalized cdnas were then subjected to amplification by pcr in order to identify the population that had undergone the best normalization. aliquots of the pcr reaction were extracted at different amplification cycles and tested by electrophoresis to identify the samples showing a good normalization profile . the profile of an efficiently normalized and amplified cdna was one whose overall signal intensity of a smear  was similar to that shown for the control, but does not contain distinguishable bands nor shows smear in the high-molecular-weight region of the gel . finally, a virtual northern  <cit>  was carried out to estimate the relative concentration of a highly abundant clone in both the non-normalized and the normalized cdna populations obtained from the second run of amplification . the clone c32009h <dig> from the contig acl11contig <dig>  whose consensus sequence shows similarity with the family of lectin-related protein kinases, was selected as probe because it was present at high copy number in the equivalent full-length non-normalized cdna library rvdevelop <dig>  revealing the high expression of the corresponding citrus gene. equal amounts of normalized and non-normalized cdna samples were electrophoresed and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. the reduction in the abundance of the frequent clone, used as a radioactive probe, in the normalized sample became evident since much lower signal intensity was detected when compared to that observed in the non-normalized cdna.

in summary,  <dig> out of the  <dig> full-length cdna libraries were normalized using this approach. overall, the redundancy of these libraries is lower than that of non-normalized libraries . furthermore, when the distribution of the number of ests per contig is compared, normalized libraries show a higher proportion of contigs with a low number of ests and a lower proportion of contigs represented by a high number of ests . finally, the new citrus ests collection added almost  <dig> new genes not previously represented in the citrus harvest database, which already contains  <dig>  ests. these results show a good efficiency for the normalization step and demonstrate the convenience of this approach to improve the efficacy of the sequencing effort at isolating new and/or low expressed transcripts in the est collections.

functional analysis of citrus genes by transformation of arabidopsis plants
arabidopsis is the reference system for plant biologists  <cit>  due to several characteristics, such as the availably of its full-genome sequence and simplicity of transformation, which makes it an excellent system for functional analysis of heterologous genes. for the ectopic expression of citrus genes in arabidopsis, we chose the destination vector pmdc <dig> designed by curtis et al.  <cit> . the backbone of this vector is derived from the pcambia series of binary vectors for agrobacterium-mediated plant transformation. the gateway cassette is adjacent to the dual 35s camv promoter, so the expression of the heterologous genes is under the control of this strong promoter.

to validate the system implemented in our cdna collection for rapid functional characterization of citrus genes, we selected a citrus member of the sepallata gene family of transcription factors with mads-box domain. plant mads-box gene family participates in the determination of floral organ identity. among them, the sepallata are a class of mad-box genes with a role as floral homeotic genes that are required for the development of petals, stamens and carpels  <cit> . in arabidopsis, the sepallata gene family is composed of four members . triple mutant arabidopsis plants lacking the activity of three sep1/2/ <dig> genes produce flowers in which all organs develop as sepals  <cit> . moreover, over-expression of these genes provokes alterations in organ identity as well as early flowering and curly leaves  <cit> . in addition, other sepallata genes from different species have been expressed in arabidopsis. for example, overexpression of either lily lmads <dig> or wheat tamads <dig>  both orthologs of arabidopsis sep <dig>  causes early flowering after producing only four or five curly rosette leaves  <cit> . thus sep gene function is easy to score by ectopic expression in a validated heterologous system, like arabidopsis.

to express a citrus sep gene in arabidopsis, we first searched our citrus database for a full-length clone showing the highest homology to sepallata genes. in alignment assays, the clone c32006d <dig>  that had been isolated from the cdna library rvdevelop <dig>  showed a high degree of sequence identity  with the arabidopsis gene sep <dig>  the c32006d <dig> clone was completely sequenced. it corresponds to a 999-nt transcript, with a deduced protein sequence of  <dig> amino acids with a molecular weight of  <dig>  kda . aminoacid sequence also showed a very high sequence similarity to arabidopsis sep proteins , indicating that the c32006d <dig> clone corresponds to the citrus orthologs of the arabidopsis sep <dig> . thus, the corresponding gene was named citrsep. more recently, five citrus sep genes  have been isolated and characterized  <cit> . although citrsep is almost identical to citmads <dig>  they differ in the first  <dig> aminoacid residues , with the amino-end sequence of citrsep  being identical to all arabidopsis sep genes , unlike the distinct n-terminal sequence of citmads <dig>  margg-. thus, citrsep and citmads <dig> appear to correspond to different but highly related citrus genes.

the citrsep cdna clone was then transferred to the destination vector pmdc <dig> by means of lr clonase reaction as detailed in methods. this clone was introduced in arabidopsis, and several hygromycin-resistant homozygous lines were selected. figure  <dig> shows the expression of citrsep gene in transgenic lines l120- <dig> and l120- <dig>  which displayed the highest expression levels and were thus selected for further analysis. next, we tested the expression of the endogenous sep genes, as well as citrsep, by qrt-pcr with gene-specific primers. interestingly, along with the overexpression of the citrsep gene, the endogenous sep <dig> was also strongly upregulated in these lines , while the other three sep genes were also affected but to a lesser extent , suggesting a positive feedback on its regulation whose characterization goes beyond the scope of this work. recently, it has been reported that sep <dig> interacts with other mads-box proteins, including other sep, to form multimeric protein complexes, suggesting a role as mediator of higher-order complex formation  <cit> . transgenic plants were grown to maturity and their phenotypes were scored. both lines bolted earlier than control plants, both in long and short days . in addition, leaves of transgenic lines showed curly leaves . all of these phenotypes were indistinguishable from those already reported for the overexpression of sep genes in arabidopsis, suggesting that citrsep is indeed a functional homolog of sep <dig> in citrus.

the availability of an easy and efficient transfer method enabling subcloning of full-length cdnas into expression vectors allows for the rapid analysis of gene function in citrus. although we fully sequenced the citrsep clone as a proof of concept, the system implemented in our est collection bypasses the need for cdna sequencing, as clones can be rapidly transferred regardless of their sequence information, without restriction enzyme digestion utilized in classical cloning methods. we believe that this collection can provide an enormous advantage for gene validation in citrus. furthermore, the enrichment of full-length clones facilitates the task of genome annotation once the whole-genome sequence becomes available in the near future. the low percentage of redundancy among the clones isolated so far guarantees that many other genes can be successfully identified in new rounds of clone selection and sequencing from these libraries.

CONCLUSIONS
we isolated a new set of  <dig>  high-quality ests representing  <dig> different genes from  <dig> normalized and non-normalized cdna libraries, using an integrated methodology. these sequences provided  <dig> new citrus ests, representing  <dig> unigenes, to the collection of citrus genes available in the public databases. our collection shows enhanced enrichment for full-length transcripts thus facilitating downstream functional analysis of newly discovered genes. for this purpose, citrus cdnas were introduced in a gateway-based cloning vector for rapid high-throughput functional analysis of genes in planta. as a proof of concept of the genomic tool generated, expression in arabidopsis of the citrus sep <dig> homologue, citrsep, was shown to lead to early flowering, along with other phenotypes mimicking the over-expression of the arabidopsis sepallata genes. these findings suggest that the sep gene family performs similar roles in distantly related plant species, citrus and arabidopsis, and demonstrate the utility of the new full-length cdna clone collection for the analysis of gene function.
