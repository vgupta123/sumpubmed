BACKGROUND
porcine epidemic diarrhea virus  is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense rna virus in the family coronaviridae  <cit> . in susceptible herds, pedv is characterized by the rapid onset of watery diarrhea and vomiting in pigs of all ages, with mortality approaching 100 % in suckling piglets. first identified in  <dig>  pedv was not considered a serious threat to swine health until devastating outbreaks of pedv were reported in china in  <dig> in association with previously unrecognized genetic variants  <cit> . thereafter, pathogenic strains producing clinical ped outbreaks were reported in japan, korea, thailand, the philippines, the western hemisphere and subsequently portugal and germany . thus, in a relatively short time, pathogenic pedv has become pandemic.

since there is little possibility that pedv will soon be eradicated, it is important to identify the means to prevent and/or control its effects: pedv management will necessitate monitoring pedv in swine populations. therefore, the purpose of this study was to  describe the patterns of pedv shedding and detection in growing pigs as shown by pedv real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  testing of individual pig rectal swabs, pen fecal samples, and pen oral fluids;  describe pedv antibody kinetics as shown by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  detection of iga and igg in individual pig serum and pen oral fluid samples; and  estimate the cutoffs and performance of the pedv "whole virus" iga and igg elisas .

methods
experimental design
individual pig samples  and pen samples  were collected longitudinally from one pedv-positive commercial wean-to-finish  barn in missouri usa  and one pedv-negative commercial wtf barn in iowa usa . fecal samples and oral fluids were tested by pedv real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction . serum and oral fluid specimens were tested by two pedv antibody wv elisas . testing results were used to describe pedv shedding, establish the performance parameters of two pedv wv elisas , and characterize antibody kinetics in a commercial pig production system. this project was approved in writing both by an agent representing the livestock producer and the iowa state university office for responsible research.

site descriptions
site one was a 52-pen wtf barn stocked with ~ <dig> pigs. pens were separated by metal gates, with  <dig> pens on each side of the walk way. pens were equipped with automatic feeders, bowl drinkers, and fully slatted floors. the facility was designed with negative pressure tunnel ventilation and a deep pit  manure handling system. pigs were placed in the facility at the time of weaning . pen samples  and pig samples  were collected from the same  <dig> pens and a convenience sample of  <dig> pigs in each of the  <dig> pens at each sampling point. sampling began when the pigs were ~3 weeks of age and continued at ~2-week intervals for 27 weeks. at 10 weeks post-placement, i.e., when pigs were approximately 13 weeks of age, the producer exposed the pigs  to pedv by mixing pedv-positive fecal material with water and spraying feed and the pigs’ oral-nasal area with the mixture using a hand-held sprayer.

site two consisted of  <dig> identical 40-pen wtf barns, each stocked with ~ <dig> pigs. pens were separated by solid walls, with  <dig> pens on each side of the walk way. pens were equipped with automatic feeders, bowl drinkers, and half-slatted floors. the barns were constructed with natural ventilation and deep pit  manure handling systems. pigs were placed in the facility at the time of weaning . pen oral fluid samples were collected from  <dig> pens  in each of the  <dig> barns and serum samples were collected from a convenience sample of  <dig> pigs in  <dig> pens  in each barn. sampling began at two weeks post placement  and continued weekly for a total of  <dig> samplings. individual pig rectal swabs and pen fecal specimens were not collected on site two.

sample collection
individual pigs were restrained and bled using  <dig>  ml vacutainer tubes  and  <dig> gauge x  <dig>  cm  needles . blood samples were centrifuged at the laboratory, aliquoted, and stored at −20 °c.

fecal swabs were collected from individual pigs using a commercial collection and transport system  and stored at −20 °c. prior to testing, swabs were suspended in 1 ml of pbs , vortexed, and the liquid submitted for testing by pedv rrt-pcr.

each pen-level fecal sample consisted of a convenience sample of 3-to- <dig> fresh semi-solid feces from throughout the pen. approximately equal portions of pen feces were placed in one 50 ml tube  and stored at −20 °c. prior to testing, samples were homogenized , ~ <dig>  g placed in 1 ml of pbs  and submitted for pedv rrt-pcr testing.

pen-based oral fluids were collected as described elsewhere  <cit> . in brief, 3-strand, 100 % cotton rope was cut with the free end at shoulder height to the animals and suspended in the pen for  <dig> to 30 min. pigs actively sought out and chewed the rope, leaving the strands moistened with oral fluids. the rope was then removed from the pen and the wet portion placed in a single-use plastic bag. oral fluids were extracted by either manual or mechanical compression  of the wet rope, after which the fluid was decanted into 50 ml centrifuge tubes  and stored at −20 °c.

for each site, all samples were completely randomized  within specimen type and submitted for testing at the end of the collection period.

diagnostic testing
pedv rna extraction and real-time reverse transcriptase pcr 
in brief, 90 μl of viral rna was eluted from rectal swabs, fecal samples and oral fluid specimens using the ambion® magmax™ viral rna isolation kit  and a kingfisher®  <dig> magnetic particle processor  following the procedures provided by the manufacturers. samples were tested for pedv using a pedv n gene-based rrt-pcr described in madson et al.  <cit>  and performed routinely at the iowa state university-veterinary diagnostic laboratory . the forward primer sequence was 5′-cgcaaagactgaacccactaacct-3′, the reverse primer sequence was 5′-ttgcctctgttgttacttggagat-3′, and probe sequence was 5′-fam-tgttgccat/zen/taccacgactcctgc-iowa black-3′. the eluted rna, primers, and probe were mixed with commercial reagents taqman® fast virus 1-step master mix  and the rrt-pcr reactions were conducted on an abi  <dig> fast instrument  in fast mode as follows: 1 cycle at 50 °c for 5 min, 1 cycle at 95 °c for 20 s, 40 cycles at 95 °c for 3 s, and 60 °c for 30 s. the results were analyzed using an automatic baseline setting with a threshold at  <dig> . quantification cycle  values <  <dig> were considered positive for the corresponding coronavirus. data were reported as ‘adjusted cqs’:  <dig> adjustedcq=35–samplecq 

pedv whole virus  antibody elisa
a u.s. prototype pedv isolate  was used in the pedv wv antibody elisa. each batch of approximately 1000 ml of pedv was propagated on vero cells . briefly, one 75 cm <dig> flask  of confluent vero cells was inoculated with 3 ml of pedv stock  followed by the addition of 50 ml of cell culture medium composed of mem 1x  supplemented with  <dig>  % tryptose phosphate broth,  <dig>  % yeast extract,  <dig> ug per ml trypsin  <dig> , plus penicillin/streptomycin , gentamicin  and amphotericin  as antibiotics. after  <dig> to 4 days at 37 °c in a 5 % co <dig> incubator and when cytopathic effects were apparent, the contents of the flask  were used to further expand the virus by inoculating each of  <dig> 875 cm <dig> flasks  containing confluent vero cell monolayers with 13 ml of the harvested pedv plus 240 ml of culture medium. after  <dig> to 4 days of incubation and when cytopathic effects were apparent, the fluid was frozen , thawed, poured off, and then centrifuged at  <dig>  x g for 15 min to remove cell debris. the virus was pelleted by ultracentrifugation at  <dig>  x g for 3 h, after which the pellet was washed twice with sterile pbs  to remove culture medium components. the purified virus was re-suspended in 100µl pbs  at a 1: <dig> dilution of the original supernatant volume and stored at −80 °c. following titration and optimal dilution , polystyrene 96-well microtitration plates  were manually coated  with the viral antigen solution and incubated at 4 °c overnight. after incubation, plates were washed  <dig> times, blocked with 300 μl per well of a solution containing 1 % bovine serum albumin , and incubated at 25 °c for 2 h. plates were then dried at 37 °c for 4 h and stored at 4 °c in a sealed bag with desiccant packs. the performance of each lot of plates was standardized using a panel of reference pedv negatives and positives. plate lots with a coefficient of variation ≥10 % were rejected.

elisa conditions for the detection of anti-pedv iga and igg antibodies in serum and oral fluid specimens, including coating and blocking conditions, reagent concentrations, incubation times, and buffers, were identical. serum samples were diluted 1: <dig> and oral fluid samples were diluted 1: <dig>  after which plates were loaded with 100 μl of the diluted sample per well. plates were incubated at 25 °c  or 37 °c  for 1 h and then washed  <dig> times with pbs . positive and negative plate controls, i.e., antibody-positive and -negative experimental serum samples, were run in duplicate on each elisa plate.

to perform the assay, 100 μl of peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-pig igg  antibody  diluted 1: <dig>  for serum and 1: <dig>  for oral fluid samples or goat anti-pig iga  diluted 1: <dig>  for serum and 1: <dig>  for oral fluid samples was added to each well and the plates incubated at 25 °c  or 37 °c  for 1 h. after a washing step, the reaction was visualized by adding 100 μl of tetramethylbenzidine-hydrogen peroxide  substrate solution to each well. after 5 min incubation at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of stop solution  to each well. reactions were measured as optical density  at 450 nm using an elisa plate reader  operated with commercial software . the antibody response in serum and oral fluid samples was represented as sample-to-positive  ratios calculated as:  <dig> s/pratio=sampleod–negativecontrolmeanodpositivecontrolmeanod–negativecontrolmeanod 

data analysis
statistical analyses were performed using commercial statistical software  using test results on serum , oral fluid , rectal swabs , and pen feces . a mixed-effects repeated measures model  was used to analyze the association between the detection of pedv by rrt-pcr and the variables of interest, i.e., sample specimen  and day post exposure  using pen as a random effect. fixed effects were considered significant at α =  <dig> . differences in the proportion of pedv rrt-pcr positive oral fluid, rectal swab, and pen feces was compared using the fisher exact test. point and interval estimates of the sensitivity and specificity of the pedv wv igg and iga elisas for serum and oral fluid samples were calculated using the exact binomial formula and confidence intervals.

RESULTS
pedv rrt-pcr
on site two, all oral fluid samples  collected during the monitoring period were pedv rrt-pcr-negative.

on site one, pedv was detected in individual rectal swabs, pen fecal samples, and pen oral fluids by rrt-pcr collected for 10 weeks post exposure , i.e., through  <dig> dpe . an analysis of the adjusted rrt-pcr cq values showed differences in the concentration of pedv in the three sample types over time . the concentration of pedv was higher in pen fecal samples compared to rectal swabs  and oral fluids  at  <dig> dpe. thereafter, no difference was detected in the concentration of virus in oral fluid and pen fecal samples through  <dig> dpe. in contrast, the concentration of pedv in rectal swab samples was significantly lower than in pen fecal samples and oral fluid samples at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dpe  .fig.  <dig> detection of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus  in pig rectal swabs, pen-based oral fluids, and pen-based fecal specimens from site one by rrt-pcr. at 13 weeks of age, the producer exposed the pigs to pedv-positive fecal material mixed with water using a hand-held sprayer. a : mean adjusted quantification cycle   of positive samples. b : proportion of positive samples

discussion
the first objective of this study was to compare the detection of pedv by rrt-pcr in rectal swabs, pen fecal samples, and oral fluid samples from pigs housed in commercial wtf facilities. specifically, comparisons were made among specimens in the duration of pedv detection, proportion of positive samples, and concentration of virus in positive samples.

pedv was detected by rrt-pcr in rectal swabs, pen fecal samples, and oral fluid samples, with the last rrt-pcr positive rectal swabs collected at  <dig> dpe, pen fecal samples at  <dig> dpe, and oral fluid samples at  <dig> dpe. the fact that the cessation of pedv detection coincided in fecal and oral fluid samples suggested that the environment did not serve as a reservoir for pedv. previous publications provided data with which rectal swab data could be compared, but a comprehensive search of the literature did not find previous reports on the detection of pedv in pen feces or pen-based oral fluid samples. madson et al.  <cit>  detected pedv in rectal swabs through 24 days post inoculation  in  <dig> of  <dig> pigs inoculated at 3 weeks of age with pedv isolate us/iowa/18984/ <dig>  thomas et al.  <cit>  detected pedv in rectal swabs for up to  <dig> dpi in 3-week-old pigs inoculated with pedv isolate us/in19338/ <dig>  crawford et al.  <cit>  detected pedv in rectal swabs for up to  <dig> dpi in 4-week-old pigs infected by contact with a pig inoculated with pedv isolate us/colorado/ <dig> 

the concentration of virus, as measured by rrt-pcr, differed among specimen types. in particular, the concentration of pedv nucleic acid in individual pig rectal swabs was significantly lower than oral fluid or pen-based fecal samples. the concentration of virus in pedv rrt-pcr-positive oral fluid and pen-based fecal samples was not significantly different, except at  <dig> dpe.

differences were also detected among specimen types in the proportion of positive samples by time. all oral fluid samples were rrt-pcr positive  through  <dig> dpe while the number pedv rrt-pcr-positive pen fecal samples and rectal swabs declined to ≤  <dig> % at  <dig> dpe and later. the lower concentration and lower rate of detection in rectal swabs could be attributed to the small volume of sample retained by the swab plus the effect of diluting each rectal swab in one ml of pbs prior to testing. the lower rate of detection in pen floor fecal samples may reflect the non-uniform distribution of positive samples within a pen. previously, o’connor et al.  <cit>  reported differences in salmonella concentrations at various locations within a pen, i.e., the distribution of salmonella within a pen was not uniform.

detection of pedv by rrt-pcr using pen-based oral fluid samples has not previously been reported in the refereed literature. using the described procedures, one oral fluid sample from a pen provided detection equal to, or better than, rectal swab samples from  <dig> pigs in the pen. likewise, detection using oral fluid samples was equal to, or better than, detection using pen fecal samples. thus, the data indicated that oral fluids were an effective and sensitive specimen for herd-level rrt-pcr-based detection of pedv in commercial growing pig environments.

the second objective of the study was to describe pedv serum and oral fluid iga and igg antibody kinetics and to estimate the performance of the pedv “whole virus” iga and igg indirect elisas at different cutoffs.

for serum igg and iga, respectively, a cutoff of s/p ≥  <dig>  provided diagnostic sensitivities of  <dig>   and  <dig>   and diagnostic specificities of  <dig>   and  <dig>  . although both serum igg and serum iga were detected by  <dig> dpe, the serum igg response provided better diagnostic performance than serum iga . serum igg results declined slowly over the monitoring period, with 60 % of serum samples positive  at the final sampling on  <dig> dpe. the utility of the pedv wv serum iga elisa is a question for future research. in particular, research is needed to determine whether the detection of serum iga, i.e., an antibody isotype necessarily produced by the piglet in response to infection, could be used to identify infection in the face of pedv-specific colostral  antibody or whether serum iga response could be used  in a confirmatory assay to clarify equivocal pedv wv igg elisa results.

for oral fluid igg and iga, respectively, a cutoff of s/p ≥  <dig>  provided diagnostic sensitivities of  <dig>   and  <dig>   and diagnostic specificities of  <dig>  %  and  <dig>  . although oral fluid igg and iga were detected by  <dig> dpe, the oral fluid iga response gave better diagnostic performance than igg. notably, the oral fluid iga response increased through  <dig> dpe and only began to decline at the last sampling on  <dig> dpe.

there are no prior reports against which to directly compare the pedv oral fluid antibody kinetics observed in the current study, but debuysscher and berman  <cit>  reported a large increase in iga-secreting cells within the salivary glands of pigs following oral exposure to another coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus . on the other hand, brandtzæg  <cit>  noted that enteric stimulation does not necessarily produce a strong salivary iga response in humans. because of similarities in experimental design, these data may also be compared to oral fluid igg and iga responses reported for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus  and influenza a virus   <cit> . kittawornrat et al.  <cit>  evaluated prrsv oral fluid igg and iga responses using pen-based field samples and experimental oral fluid samples. using a commercial prrs serum antibody elisa adapted to oral fluids, igg was readily detected and provided a diagnostic sensitivity of  <dig>   and specificity of  <dig>  . in contrast, the iga response in oral fluid was detectable, but weak and transient. panyasing et al.  <cit>  evaluated influenza a virus igg and iga responses in oral fluids. unlike the prrsv response, both anti-iav igg and iga were readily detected in oral fluids by ~ <dig> dpi and throughout the study . these studies suggest that oral fluid igg and iga kinetics vary among pathogens. thus, it will be critical to evaluate antibody isotype kinetics during the process of adapting antibody assays to the swine oral fluid matrix.

for disease surveillance in swine populations, diagnostic specificity is paramount because false positives quickly erode confidence in test results. therefore, the investigators recommend a conservative s/p cutoff for serum and oral fluid samples, e.g., ≥  <dig>  for routine use. however, diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were presented for several pedv wv elisa s/p cutoffs  to allow users to interpret results in the context of specific circumstances.

CONCLUSIONS
the purpose of surveillance is to provide timely information on pathogen exposure and immune responses in swine populations in order to optimize health and prevent disease. well-validated, reproducible, high-throughput nucleic acid and antibody assays are necessary to achieve this purpose. this study showed that oral fluid-based testing could provide an easy and “animal-friendly” approach to nucleic acid and/or antibody-based surveillance of pedv in swine populations. in particular, the exceptional strength and duration of the pedv iga antibody response in oral fluids raises the question as to its ability to serve as an indicator of protective immunity; this is a question for future research.
