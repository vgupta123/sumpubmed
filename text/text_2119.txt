BACKGROUND
3′untranslated regions  are the sequences located immediately downstream of from the stop codon of mature mrnas. although historical attention focused on protein coding sequences and upstream regions, 3′utrs have recently become subject to intense study because they are targets of a variety of regulatory molecules, including rna binding proteins  and small non-coding rnas , that recognize small cis-elements present in the 3′utrs. these cis-elements play critical roles in deciding the fate of the mrna via various mechanisms, including co-transcriptional processing, modulating protein translation, mrna localization and trafficking, and mrna degradation and stability  <cit> . disruption of these processes is known to affect diverse developmental and metabolic processes, and contributes to various diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, and cancer .

rbps play a role in every aspect of mrna biogenesis, such as stability, localization, translation and decay. the human transcriptome contains approximately ~ <dig> proteins with distinguishable rna binding domains  <cit> , and their deregulation is linked to major neurodegenerative disorders, cancer, and muscular dystrophies. compared to transcription factors, which generally bind highly specific linear dna sequence elements, elements in 3′utrs targeted by rbps are generally more degenerate and difficult to identify bioinformatically because rna is a single-stranded molecule and rbp binding is mostly dictated by local folding and polarity  <cit> . consequently, rbps have the potential to bind to multiple elements in different 3′utrs, leading to intricate, dynamic, and mostly unknown networks of rna-protein interactions.

3′utrs are also targeted by a class of post-transcriptional regulators known as micrornas , which are short non-coding rnas that bind to complementary sequences in the 3′utrs of metazoans  <cit> . once bound, based on the degree of complementarity, mirnas can induce either translational repression or mrna degradation  <cit> . mirnas canonically recognize targets in 3′utrs via watson-crick base pairing, requiring complementarity with as few as six consecutive nucleotides between the 5′end of a mature mirnas and the 3′utr of a target transcript  <cit> . however, recent evidence suggest that mirnas do not require perfect complementarity with target 3′utrs to induce functional translational repression, and non-canonical interactions are frequent  <cit> . because mirna target elements are degenerate and small they are difficult to detect, thus a vast majority of biologically relevant mirna targets are still unknown. based on bioinformatic predictions of mirna-binding sites in 3′utrs, it has been proposed that each mirna controls large networks of hundreds of mrnas  <cit> . however, recent analysis of the predictive performance of several of the most prominent prediction algorithms, such as targetscan  <cit> , pictar  <cit>  and diana-microt  <cit>  report extremely high false negative rates  <cit> . while these algorithms are very useful for candidate gene approaches to identify mirna targets, the extremely high error rates make high-throughput target detection challenging. coupled with the absence of a publically available and comprehensive 3′utr library, the field currently lacks tools to systematically study mirna targets, which is the gold standard in mirna biology.

several genomic resources are currently available to systematically study gene expression and its regulation in humans. the human orfeome for example, is a collection of over  <dig>  human protein-coding genes cloned in modular vectors and optimized to study the dynamics of gene expression  <cit> . the orfeome has been used to characterize genome wide protein-protein interaction networks, leading to important discoveries relevant to human disease  <cit> . ht resources such as this can significantly advance our understanding of gene functions in multicellular organisms. unfortunately, such a standardized ht tool to detect and study regulatory elements in 3′utrs are not available since 3′utr sequences are not present in the orfeome. some individual 3′utr clones are available commercially, but these products have sporadic coverage, are too expensive for ht studies, use only proprietary vectors and are not compatible with the orfeome. furthermore, endogenous full length 3′utrs frequently undergo alternative processing in a tissue specific fashion  <cit> , which limits the biological relevance of experiments that use truncated or partial 3′utrs.

to overcome this limitation, a recent study used ~ <dig>  short rna sequences containing all possible 9-base nucleotide permutations immobilized on microarrays to study the binding requirements of  <dig> human rbps  <cit> . although this work and others highlights important binding properties of rbps, they do not necessarily reflect biological settings, where accessory elements near binding sites that may cooperate with the rbps targeting are not present.

recently, our group experimented with the usage of a pilot human full length 3′utr library to detect mirna targets in 3′utrs using a scalable dual-luciferase assay named luminescent identification of functional elements in 3′utrs   <cit> . although we cloned and screened only ~ <dig> query 3′utrs, the proof of principle 3′life screen was highly effective at the rapid and efficient discovery of many novel targets for two cancer relevant mirnas, let-7c and mir-10b  <cit> . this pilot screen demonstrated the value of such an unbiased ht approach, and supports the need for the development of a publically available genome wide 3′utr library.

furthermore, there is a critical need in the field for a high-quality and standardized human 3′utr resource, which could be widely used in the community to study mirnas and rbps using full length 3′utrs in unbiased and ht experiments.

to overcome these limitations, we have developed the first publically available and high-quality human 3′utr clone library, sequenced verified and cloned in modular vectors amenable to various downstream analyses. this resource enables the systematic study of 3′utr biology, can be used to efficiently detect mirna and rbp targets at high resolution, and study mrna localization and dynamics. in the context of disease states, this library allows the study of key disease alterations in post-transcriptional processing, such as disease-specific: 1) mrna mislocalization, 2) alternative polyadenylation, 3) altered mirna expression, 4) mutation of rna binding protein elements in 3′utrs, and 5) more generally, the contribution of post-transcriptional gene regulation to gene output in disease initiation and progression.

RESULTS
the human 3′utrome v <dig> clone collection  consists of  <dig>  unique, cloned and sequence-validated human 3′utrs from transcription factors, kinases and other regulatory genes . this collection is contained in modular gateway® compatible entry vectors, is amenable for large screens and is publically available to the community through the at the dnasu plasmid repository .fig.  <dig> the human 3′utrome cloning pipeline. a we targeted a panel of  <dig>  unique human 3′utrs and successfully cloned and sequence verified  <dig>  unique 3′utrs . b the forward primers used to amplify 3′utr genomic loci were anchored within the last exon of each transcript, ending with the gene specific stop codons. the reverse primers bound 150 nucleotides downstream of the annotated transcript. c flow chart summarizing the cloning pipeline of the h3′utrome v <dig>  genomic pcr was performed using 3′utr specific primers and the pcr products were shuttled into gateway® entry vectors by recombinational cloning. single cloned colonies were isolated and screened based on the expected 3′utr length using pcr and gel electrophoresis. bacterial colonies passing the screen were then re-arrayed, and the cloned 3′utrs were sequenced using sanger sequencing method. the sequence verified 3′utrs were then submitted to the dnasu plasmid repository for public distribution. 3′utrs that were not successfully cloned were subject to a second pass of cloning. d electrophoretic analysis of pcr products from the complete h3′utrome v <dig>  the sizes of 3′utrs from  <dig>  pcr reactions were analyzed on ethidium bromide stained gels



primer design and genomic pcr
as a first release, we targeted and designed genomic primer pairs encompassing the 3′utr regions of  <dig>  human protein coding genes using the human genome release  <dig>    <cit> .

the forward primers used for the genomic pcr were designed to anneal within the last exon of the target gene, ending with the gene-specific stop codon in frame with the rest of the transcript . this expedient allowed us to increase the melting temperature of each forward primer, since the g/c content drops considerably after the stop codon. in addition, designing the forward primer within the open reading frame provides the 3′utr with its natural gene-specific stop codon at its 5′end, allowing convenient in-frame integration with the human orfeome library, which instead lacks termination codons  <cit>  . the melting temperatures of the primers ranged from  <dig> to 76 °c. given this wide range of temperature we opted for a touchdown genomic pcr approach, starting at 66 °c and decreasing by 1 °c each cycle  <cit> . the reverse primers were designed to target a genomic site 150 nt downstream of the annotated transcript, encompassing downstream elements that may play a role in mrna 3′end formation . we added the gateway® recombination elements attb <dig>  and attb <dig>  to the 5′ends of the genomic primers, to facilitate the cloning into gateway® compatible entry vectors. a minimum of 200 ng of genomic dna per reaction was required to obtain an enriched pcr product while minimizing non-specific amplicons, which is known to impact the recombinational cloning procedure. the complete pipeline used in this study is shown in fig. 1c.

gateway® recombinational cloning
the full understanding of gene expression must consider both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation, requiring attention to the transcriptional promoter, the open reading frame  and the regulatory sites within the 3′utr.

the human 3′utrs in this collection were cloned into the pdonr p2r-p <dig> gateway® entry vector  using bp recombinant cloning. this vector is part of the three-fragment gateway® technology, which allows modular cloning of a given promoter, an orfeome entry and correspondent 3′utr to be assembled in order, into a single vector in the same reaction. this allows investigators to combine these 3′utrs with different orfs  to create both natural and novel regulatory contexts. current protein expression vectors typically rely on viral 3′utrs, such as the sv <dig> polya, which often do not reflect natural translational levels or post-transcriptional regulation. in addition, the natural 3′utr may contribute to proper localization and stability. this technology is also compatible with the 3′life assay system and has been previously used to screen for functional mirna targeting in 3′utrs  <cit> . successfully cloned colonies were isolated and grown in lb and analyzed by colony pcr using primers specific to the pdonr p2r-p <dig> backbone. the pcr amplicons were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and screened based on the expected lengths of the 3′utrs . we observed an inverse correlation between the size of the inserted 3′utr and the bp cloning success rate . a size bias during the bp cloning reaction has been previously reported  <cit> , with a decreased efficiency for amplicons greater than  <dig>  nt and in agreement with our observations  <cit> . however 3′utrs in the h3′utrome v <dig> are enriched with longer 3′utr isoforms and on average contain longer 3′utrs than those within the human transcriptome . the nucleotide lengths of the human 3′utr clones in this release span from 200 nt to  <dig>  nt and have a median length of  <dig>  nt, as opposed to the median length of 3′utrs within the human genome, which is  <dig>  nt .fig.  <dig> overview of the human 3′utrome v <dig> library. a percentage of cloning success vs 3′utr length. the efficiency of 3′utr cloning  decreases ~30 % beyond the length of  <dig>  nucleotides in the cloned dataset . the maximum cloning efficiency for amplicons smaller than 499 nt was  <dig>  %, while the cloning efficiency of 3′utrs grater than  <dig> nts was  <dig>  %. b length of the 3′utrs of genes in the human genome hg <dig> vs the h3′utrome v <dig>  the 3′utrs in the h3′utrome v <dig> range between 200 nt to  <dig>  nt, and are enriched for longer 3′utr isoforms. the median length of 3′utrs in the h3′utrome v <dig> is  <dig>  nt  while in the human genome hg <dig> it is  <dig>  nt . c the h3′utrome v <dig> contains 3′utrs for 6-10 % of the orfs within each chromosome. none of the 3′utrs cloned in this release originates from the y chromosome, as the source of genomic dna used was of female origin. d the degree of overlap between the h3′utrome v <dig> and the horfeome v <dig> . more than half of the 3′utrs cloned in the h3′utrome v <dig> contain corresponding clones present in the horfeome v <dig> . e the h3′utrome v <dig>  is enriched for 3′utrs of genes involved with gene regulation as it contains predominantly 3′utrs of transcription factors , kinases , and rna binding proteins 



the first pass of cloning produced a yield of  <dig>  bacterial colonies with pcr products of the expected size. we performed a second pass on all  <dig> missed 3′utrs and gained an additional  <dig> 3′utrs, a 12 % increase to the total number of size verified clones . the complete size-verified first release of the h3′utrome v <dig> is shown in fig. 1d.

sanger sequencing
a total of  <dig>  size verified clones were subsequently sequenced using sanger method using a custom primer anchored within the p2rp <dig> plasmid backbone. we used perl scripts to perform blat alignments  <cit>  using the sanger trace files obtained during the sequencing. our analysis revealed that out of the initially targeted  <dig>  unique 3′utrs,  <dig>  were successfully sequence verified .

3′utrome library overview
the human 3′utr clones contained in the h3′utrome v <dig> are unbiased towards any particular regions of the genome and correspond to ~6-10 % of the total protein-coding genes present in each chromosome . the source of dna used for the genomic pcr was gm <dig>  a lymphoblastoid cell line of female origin recommended as a tier  <dig> cell line by the encode project. over 54 % of the 3′utrs in the h3′utrome v <dig> overlap with genes present in the horfeome v <dig>    <cit> . we targeted  <dig> 3′utrs of genes already present in the orfeome and successfully cloned  <dig> 3′utrs . for this first release, we targeted predominantly 3′utrs of genes previously classified as transcription factors  <cit> , kinases  <cit> , and rbps  <cit>  . we targeted the 3′utrs of this class of genes because they have widespread regulatory functions and have corresponding orfeome clones. the h3′utrome v <dig> release includes 3′utrs for  <dig> transcription factors,  <dig> kinases and  <dig> rbps .

library distribution
the h3′utrome v <dig> library is distributed by the dna repository dnasu , a public plasmid repository hosted at the biodesign institute at arizona state university, which already distributes over  <dig>  individual plasmids and full genome collections, including the human orfeome  <cit> . users can either search for a given 3′utr clone, a plate or order the complete dataset. many researchers are not interested in ht screens nor have the resources for large screens in their departments, but want to detect mirna targets, mutations, or truncation of regulatory elements in the 3′utr of their gene of interest. these researchers will be able to accelerate their research significantly because they can now order the correct orf, 3′utr clones and the vectors they need for their analysis at reduced cost. to simplify the ordering procedure we have given a unique id prefix ‘hsu’ to the human 3′utrs available with this release.

3′life validation screen
the 3′life screen is a high throughput dual luciferase assay, previously shown to detect functional repression of test 3′utrs by query mirnas  <cit> . the 3′life screen utilizes gateway® cloning technology and is fully compatible with the h3′utrome v <dig>  in order to demonstrate the usability and functionality of this library we have selected  <dig> human 3′utrs from the h3′utrome v <dig> library and screened for mirna targets of two disease-relevant mirnas: let-7c and mir- <dig> using the 3′life assay  <cit> . let-7c is a well-characterized tumor suppressor gene, is down-regulated in many cancers, and is known to target genes in the ras pathway  <cit> . conversely, mir- <dig> is frequently overexpressed in breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinomas, glioblastoma and prostate cancer , and has been shown to target several tumor suppressor genes such as kip- <dig> , cdkn1b, cdkn1c, pten, arhi and puma  <cit> . in addition, mir- <dig> is known to be involved with muscle damage repair and atherosclerosis  <cit> . one of the goals of this experiment was to use this 3′utr library to rapidly identify bona fide mirna targets from false targets predicted by mirna targeting software. these programs, such as targetscan  <cit> , pictar  <cit>  and diana-microt  <cit>  are known to have high false negative rates   <cit>  and false positive rates   <cit> , and cannot be used alone to definitively assign targets.

these  <dig> human 3′utrs were enriched with let-7c and mir- <dig> predicted and validated targets from all three prediction softwares  . for the let-7c screens, we also included two genes that contain validated mirna targets identified in a previous screen  <cit> . in addition, since mirnas preferentially target genes within the same regulatory pathways  <cit> , and let-7c was previously shown to target the ras family of genes  <cit> , we were interested to test if let-7c could also target additional  <dig> members of this pathway , as defined by gene ontology  <cit>  and kegg databases  <cit> .

we shuttled these  <dig> human 3′utrs from the h3′utrome v <dig> clone library into the 3′life vector using lr recombination reactions. using this custom library, we performed  <dig> fully automated transfections and dual luciferase experiments. the results of the screen are shown in fig.  <dig>  using a cut-off for functionally repressed targets at a repression index of  <dig>  and a p-value < <dig> , we obtained  <dig> statistically significant hits for let-7c, and  <dig> for mir- <dig> .fig.  <dig> the h3′utrome v <dig> as a resource to detect mirna targets in high throughput. 3′life screen performed on  <dig> human 3′utrs extracted from the h3′utrome v <dig>  queried against two mirnas let-7c and mir- <dig>  the repression index was calculated for each 3′utr and indicates a normalized ratio between firefly and renilla luciferases. a minimum cutoff for repression was drawn at  <dig>  and the asterisks denote statistically significant repression . the top hits for each mirna are displayed as a heat map on the right panels. increased intensity of color indicates greater repression.  <dig> top hits were identified for let-7c of which  <dig> were previously validated .  <dig> top hits were identified for mir- <dig> of which  <dig> were previously validated 



our results validate  <dig> out of  <dig> of the let-7c targets predicted by prediction softwares . within the predicted hits, we detected all three previously validated targets  and an unvalidated, predicted target  . furthermore we detected an additional  <dig> novel and unpredicted targets for let-7c . we found that one of these novel targets pak <dig>  was predicted by the prediction algorithm miranda  <cit> , which takes into account non-canonical seed interactions. of note,  <dig> targets within this group  were previously correlated indirectly with let- <dig> expression  <cit> .

for mir- <dig>  our results validated  <dig> out of  <dig> of the mir- <dig> targets predicted by the prediction software , and an additional  <dig> out of  <dig> of the targets previously validated by others   . interestingly, we were unable to detect repression in 3′utrs of  <dig> genes previously known to contain mir- <dig> responsive elements  . upon further review, we found that repression of all five targeted elements was demonstrated using truncated sections of the 3′utr. thus, the observation that the 3′life screen did not detect these targets could be caused by the inability of these elements to recruit mir- <dig> when expressed within their full length endogenous 3′utrs, or by the presence of alternative polyadenylation events that cause the lost of these elements  <cit> . two targets of mir- <dig> called by the prediction software  were also not detected as hits in our assay . we also discovered  <dig> novel and unpredicted targets for mir- <dig> not anticipated by major prediction software , or detected by others. . within this group, frap <dig> was the only gene predicted by miranda  <cit> . perfect complementarity within the seed region is considered the canonical indicator of mirnas targeting. interestingly, most of these novel targets do not always contain canonical seeds. recent studies indicate that mirnas are also capable of recognizing non-canonical elements in target mrnas  <cit> , supporting our findings.

taken together, these experiments validate  <dig> out of  <dig> bioinformatically predicted targets  , which is in accordance with the false positive rates of prediction algorithms reported in previous studies  <cit> . in previous studies we used repression data from the 3′life assay to identify and validate functional mirna binding sites  <cit> . with experimentally validated mirna target sites, targeting signatures can be extrapolated to refine target predictions for specific mirnas.

interestingly, while the 3′life assay is designed to detect repression of 3′utrs by mirnas, we detected several 3′utrs that significantly enhanced the expression of the luciferase reporter gene in the presence of let-7c and mir- <dig> . perhaps these enhancements are caused by increase stability of a given 3′utr due to direct or indirect interactions with the query mirnas.

the ability to systematically screen large numbers of human 3′utrs allowed in depth analysis of high-confidence target genes regulated by different mirnas, and may reveal novel mechanisms that mirnas use to regulate biological processes. for example, a gene ontology analysis of the let-7c top hits showed an enrichment for genes involved in cell cycle checkpoint regulation, while a similar analysis for mir- <dig> revealed a relationship with genes involved in negative regulation of muscle differentiation .

in addition, out of the  <dig> genes involved in the ras pathway, our screen identified  <dig> genes directly targeted by let-7c , suggesting a role for let-7c in regulating this pathway.

CONCLUSIONS
3′utrs contain powerful regulatory elements that are critical in various biological processes, yet remain poorly characterized because due to the absence of genomic tools that allow their systematic study. in this work we have prepared the first human 3′utr clone collection named h3′utrome v <dig>  which is produced to a single high quality standard. this library is compatible with the cloning technology used to produce the human orfeome, expanding the potential of well-established operating methods for high throughput experimentation. the h3′utrome v <dig> library is sequence verified, and readily available to the community with simple online access to information through the dnasu repository  <cit> , at a low cost to all scientists with minimal restriction. in order to demonstrate its utility, we performed a screen with  <dig> human 3′utrs cherry picked from the h3′utrome v <dig>  and rapidly identified  <dig> mirna targets for two disease-relevant mirnas, let-7c and mir- <dig>  within this pool, we identified  <dig> novel targets for these two mirnas, which were previously uncharacterized . in addition, we were able to eliminate  <dig> out of  <dig> bioinformatically predicted targets , and rapidly associate mirna activities to biological pathways using a rapid screening technology.

the h3′utrome v <dig> can be easily used in similar ht experiments to systematically study rbp targeting in 3′utrs, mrna localization and the role of small ncrnas in post transcriptional gene regulation.
