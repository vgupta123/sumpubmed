BACKGROUND
in japan, certain traditional herbal medicines , which comprise hot water extracts from a mixture of medicinal plants, have been widely used as ethical drugs and become integrated into the modern medical system  <cit> . these traditional medicines are manufactured under strict scientific quality control and are covered by public health insurance. a large amount of clinical and basic research on kampo medicines has been performed, including more than  <dig> multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind studies.

we investigated the effects of juzentaihoto  in this study. jtx is a well known kampo medicine that comprises  <dig> different herbs; ginseng radix, astragali radix, angelicae radix, rehmanniae radix, atractylodis lanceae rhizoma, cinnamomi cortex, poria, paeoniae radix, ligustici rhizoma and glycyrrhizae radix. jtx has been used for centuries for the treatment of various kinds of disease or disorders such as anemia, rheumatoid arthritis, atopic dermatitis, chronic fatigue syndrome and ulcerative colitis  <cit> . experimental studies show that jtx reduces the side effect of chemotherapy and radiotherapy  <cit> , prevents various types of cancer and its metastasis  <cit> , improves osteoporosis  <cit>  as well as atopic dermatitis  <cit> , and protects against candida infection  <cit> . the active substances responsible for stimulation of hematopoietic stem cell growth  <cit> , various immunostimulating activities  <cit> , alleviation of side-effects by chemotherapeutic agents  <cit> , and protection against candida infection  <cit>  have been identified.

in kampo therapy, medical care is individualized with tailoring prescriptions depending on the patients' constitution, disease state and responsiveness to therapy  <cit> . indeed, the therapeutic effects of kampo-medicines have been known to vary markedly among individuals. therefore, depending on the individual patient it is not unusual to use different kampo drugs to treat the same disease, or alternatively, to use the same drug to treat apparently different diseases. thus, the effect of kampo medicines should be investigated by taking into consideration the possible dependence on the constitution, for example the immunological properties, of the individual patient.

most kampo medicines administered orally are known to have probiotic, prebiotic and antibiotic properties. for example, we have previously demonstrated that jtx alters the population of intestinal microflora, which affects the gene expression of heat shock proteins hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> in the gut and liver   <cit> . conversely, certain glycosides included in kampo medicines are known to require metabolic conversion to a bioactive deglycosylated form by intestinal flora for expression of their pharmacological activity   <cit> . finally, certain immunomodulating effects of kampo medicines, including jtx, are known to be mediated by chemical components that are not thought to be absorbed  <cit> . the components of kampo medicines may affect general immunity indirectly, presumably through interaction with the gut local immune system. thus, the intestinal microflora is thought to play a critical role in eliciting the beneficial effects of kampo medicines.

because each kampo medicine contains a vast number of ingredients, the biological effects are presumably mediated by multiple active components and their various target sites of action. thus, a study involving any specific medicinal component or site of action is, in principle, inadequate. to clarify the action of such a complicated medicine requires an exhaustive approach such as transcriptome or proteome analysis. however, there have been very few studies that adopt an "omics" approach aimed at studying the pharmacology of kampo medicines.

here, we have attempted to resolve the above-mentioned problem by using the following approaches. 1) we investigated the effect of jtx on gene expression in the large intestines. as previously described, the effect of jtx extends over various organs and the entire body. however, the biological properties of jtx on the intestines may involve a broad spectrum of pharmacological effects. 2) we used genechip® arrays to obtain a genome-wide profile of gene expression after jtx treatment. 3) we compared enteric flora-present specific pathogen-free  and enteric flora-absent germ-free  mice of the iqi strain to evaluate the influence of microflora on the action of jtx. 4) to determine the effect of the difference of immune properties the same experimental investigation was additionally performed on spf balb/c mice. our investigation has identified a possible molecular pathway to explain the well-known effect of jtx in reducing the incidence of viral infections. specifically, jtx enhances interferon-α production via elevation of steady-state expression level of interferon regulatory factors such as stat <dig>  stat <dig>  isgf3γ and irf <dig> 

RESULTS
literature analysis of genechip data
firstly, we investigated the effect of jtx on the steady state level of mrna in the large intestines using iqi specific pathogen free  and balb/c spf mice . when we applied the criteria described in materials and methods , there were  <dig> and  <dig> annotated/identified genes whose expression level was increased by jtx treatment in iqi and balb/c mice, respectively . the numbers of down-regulated genes were  <dig> and  <dig> in iqi and balb/c mice, respectively . there were no common denominations between the up-regulated genes in iqi and those in balb/c, and between the down-regulated genes in iqi and those in balb/c. however, there was a striking commonality  in the panels of genes that were up-regulated in iqi and genes down-regulated in balb/c mice . to elucidate the transcriptional co-regulation networks triggered by jtx, we used genomatix' bibliosphere software, which allows analyzing gene/gene, and gene/transcription factor relations from their co-citation in pubmed abstracts. the above gene lists were used as input to bibliosphere. this approach allowed us to reveal relationships between the cluster of jtx-affected genes and other genes/transcription factors, which were co-cited with all or some of the genes from the input cluster, with the information as to whether these genes have certain promoter sequences. the results of this type of analysis, termed cluster centered bibliosphere, are shown in figure  <dig>  eleven  and  <dig>  genes are presented in figure  <dig> and they have all been reported to be induced by type  <dig> interferon   <cit> . in particular, transcription factors isgf3g and irf <dig> are known to play a definitive role in the proximal sector in the signaling pathways mediating massive interferon-α production  <cit> . accordingly,  <dig> of  <dig> genes that are common between the "spfli-up" and "balbli-down" lists contain promoter sequences for irf <dig> or isgf3g. additionally, we analyzed the effect of jtx on the expression profile of the small intestine of iqi spf mice. the profiles of the small intestine were completely different from, and had scarce commonality with, those of the large intestine of iqi spf mice .

the genes whose change was >  <dig>  fold, with p <  <dig>   were the listed sorted by fold-change. unidentified  <dig> probe sets were omitted from the list. the genes appeared commonly in tables  <dig> and  <dig> were in bold letters.

the genes whose change was <  <dig>  fold, with p <  <dig>   were the listed sorted by fold-change. unidentified  <dig> probe sets were omitted from the list "balbli-down", respectively. the genes appeared commonly in tables  <dig> and  <dig> were in bold letters.

next we analyzed the genechip results of large and small intestines of iqi germ-free  mice. in the large intestine,  <dig> genes have been listed as up-regulated . genes down-regulated by jtx treatment include  <dig> immunoglobulins. the "gfli-down" list in table  <dig> shows the other  <dig> annotated/identified genes. seven  of the  <dig> genes are common to those up-regulated in iqi spf mice  and are known to be induced by type  <dig> interferons. the list of genes whose expression is significantly down-regulated in gf mice small intestines comprise  <dig> genes . unlike the results from spf mice, the "gfsi-down" list  shows a striking commonality with the "gfli-down" list  and "spfli-up" list . the bibliosphere analysis gave cluster centered bibliosphere figures consisting of  <dig> out of  <dig> genes from "gfli-down" list  and  <dig> out of  <dig> genes from "gfsi-down" list  that have been co-cited in pubmed abstracts. figures  <dig> and  <dig> both include the two transcription factors, isgf3g and stat <dig>  which are known to be located upstream of the isgf3g-irf <dig> signaling pathway. the contents of tables and supplementary tables are summarized in additional file  <dig> 

the genes whose change was <  <dig>  fold and with p <  <dig>   were the listed sorted by fold-change. twenty four immunoglobulin genes and  <dig> unidentified probe sets were omitted from the lists. the genes appeared commonly in both tables  <dig> and  <dig> were in bold letters. the genes appeared commonly in tables  <dig> and  <dig> were underlined.

the genes whose change was <  <dig>  fold and with p <  <dig>   were the listed sorted by fold-change. eight immunoglobulin genes and  <dig> unidentified probe sets were omitted from the lists. the genes appeared commonly in both tables  <dig> and  <dig> were in bold letters. the genes appeared commonly in tables  <dig> and  <dig> were underlined.

collectively, these data strongly suggest that jtx influences, at least in part, the signaling pathways of interferon-α production in the large intestines of different mice strains  and different microflora status . these conclusions also apply to the small intestines of gf animals. the composite of cluster centered bibliosphere figures of "balb-down", "spfli-up", "gfli-down" and "gfsi-down" figures are shown in figure  <dig> suggesting almost all genes affected by jtx are under the regulation of either stat <dig>  isgf3g or irf <dig> 

validation by quantitative real time rt-pcr
to confirm the results of genechip data, quantitative real time rt-pcr analysis has been performed on  <dig> genes, focusing on type  <dig> interferon-related genes. as shown in table  <dig>  many of the changes in interferon-related genes shown in genechip data have been confirmed by pcr. messenger rnas of ifn-β, ifn-α <dig> and ifn-α <dig>  the end-products of signaling pathways of type  <dig> interferon production, were under the detection limit of real time pcr and unaffected by jtx treatment. these findings are in good agreement with the results of genechip analyses.

promoter analysis of genechip data
genes, whose expression profiles changed according to the genechip and pcr data analysis, were further investigated. several of these genes were found to act on the signaling pathway map of type  <dig> interferon production. the effect of jtx appeared to focus on the neighborhood of the isgf <dig> signaling pathway . to investigate the transcription regulation working behind the change of gene transcription, we performed promoter sequence analysis using genomatix' eldorado/gene2promoter/frameworker system to find transcription factor motifs in similarly regulated genes. co-regulation of mammalian genes usually depends on sets of transcription factors rather than an individual factor alone. regulatory sequence elements are often organized into defined frameworks of motifs of two or more transcription factor binding sites and clusters of such motifs. the frameworker software combined with the genome annotation database/interface eldorado/gene2promoter makes it possible to retrieve common frameworks in the promoter region of the input genes. twelve genes that were commonly identified in more than  <dig> lists of "balb-down", "spfli-up", "gfli-down" and "gfsi-down"  were analyzed. twenty models have been found as the operable modules consisting of two transcription factors. four models with the lowest fw-scores  were subjected to further examination. the appearance ratio of each model in the genes affected by jtx treatment and in the all annotated mouse promoters are shown in table  <dig>  the average and sd of the ratio of four cases  was statistically compared and significant differences were found for v$irff-v$irff, v$irff-v$myt <dig> and v$creb-v$gcmf. the location of v$irff-v$irff in jtx-affected genes is illustrated in figure  <dig>

jtx enhanced the abmp-induced increase of ifn-alpha production in the large intestine of iqi spf mice
to investigate whether the difference of basal expression levels of the ifn-related genes results in the altered production of ifn-α, we examined the effect of ifn-inducer on production of ifn-α protein in the large intestines . firstly, we compared the effect of three oral ifn-α inducers, 2-amino-5-bromo-6-methyl-4-pyrimidinol , tilorone analog r11567da and imiquimod. oral administration of  <dig> mg/kg body weight of imiquimod, a tlr <dig> agonist, rapidly  increased the ifn-α protein level of serum but not that of the intestines. oral administration of  <dig> mg/kg body weight of r11567da increased the level of ifn-α in both the serum and intestines within  <dig> hr. the increase in ifn-α level in the intestines induced by abmp took place over a prolonged period of time  and was relatively modest. however, abmp did not induce ifn-α production in the serum. therefore abmp was thought to be suitable for evaluation of the net increase of intestinal ifn-α production. hence, in the following experiments we chose to use abmp. the effects of abmp at the doses of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> mg/kg body weight have been compared and  <dig> mg/kg was determined as the suitable dosage .

as shown in figure  <dig>  in the absence of stimulation by abmp, the level of ifn-α protein in the large intestine was unaffected by a two week administration of jtx in iqi mice. however, in accordance with the genechip data, expression levels of stat <dig>  stat <dig> and irf <dig> were increased. when abmp was administered in jtx-treated mice, maximum concentration of ifn-α protein induced by abmp stimulation showed no change. however, ifn-α release peaked much earlier in mice given abmp compared with the control mice. furthermore, jtx treatment increased the peak level of stat <dig>  stat <dig> and irf <dig> mrnas.

similar experiments using the same protocol were performed on another strain of balb/c mice . ifn-α protein levels in the large intestine were unaffected by a two week administration of jtx alone. however, in accordance with genechip data, the steady-state levels of stat <dig>  stat <dig> and isgf3g decreased in jtx-treated mice. to our surprise, administration of an "oral ifn inducer" abmp resulted in a significant decrease in ifn-α release after  <dig> hr. the mrna expression of stat <dig>  stat <dig> and isgf3g was induced by abmp, but the irf <dig> mrna level showed no change. jtx treatment did not affect the basal level of ifn-α release, although the decrease in the level of ifn-α was evident after only  <dig> hr in jtx-treated mice i.e., earlier than the control. jtx decreased the level of isgf3g and irf <dig> mrnas compared to the control.

discussion
application of comparative functional genomics to pharmacology may make it possible to classify the biological effects of a certain drug into common universal effects and host-specific and/or anecdotal effects. such a strategy is particularly useful for investigating the pharmacology of drugs with composite properties, such as combination drugs, phytomedicines and traditional medicines that use relatively crude ingredients. this is because these medicines generally have multiple active components through which they target several different molecules to exert their pharmacological efficacy. in the present study, we performed transcriptome analyses to profile the effect of a kampo  medicine, jtx. different mice strains, whose immunological properties have been reported to be distinctive, were used. furthermore, to classify the microflora-dependent and -independent effect of jtx, we used gf and spf mice of the same iqi strain. our results have identified genes commonly affected by jtx treatment across the different strains/status of mice, which presumably represent the principal biological effects of this kampo medicine. however, the effects by jtx on expression of these genes were directionally different among the strains/status . our data suggests the following conclusions: 1) jtx has common target molecule, which may affect the expression of type- <dig> ifn-related genes, such as ifit <dig>  stat <dig> and irf7; 2) the active principles of jtx responsible for this phenomenon do not require the metabolic conversion by intestinal microflora because the same genes were affected in jtx-treated gf mice; 3) the functions of these molecules may be quite different depending on the host strain/status. this is a plausible explanation because the genes commonly affected by jtx are the immune-related genes whose outcomes are known to be drastically different  depending on the strains  <cit>  and the presence/absence of intestinal microflora  <cit> . furthermore, this finding appears to be in good accordance with the concept that kampo medicines should be administered according to the "sho". "sho" is a principle of kampo medicine that recognizes the physical constitution, immunological predisposition and responsiveness to the drugs can vary between individual patients  <cit> . the precise interpretation of "sho" in terms of modern medical science is yet to be fully defined. nonetheless, "sho" is thought to be intimately related to the patient's immunological responsiveness and the state of intestinal microflora. similarly, we have demonstrated shosaikoto, another kampo medicine, to have different, possibly even opposite, effects on lung immunity in hosts with different genetic backgrounds  <cit> .

interestingly, the genes affected by jtx were dissimilar between the small and large intestine of spf mice while the genes affected by jtx have a lot of commonality between these tissues in gf mice. as described in the results section, the "gfsi-down" list  share  <dig> genes with the "gfli-down" list  and  <dig> genes with the "spfli-up" list , respectively, while both the "spfsi-up" list  and "spfsi-down" list  share no genes with any other "up/down" lists of "gfsi" , "gfli"  and even "spfli" . thus, our results suggest that the small intestine of spf mice differentiate via a distinct process. the "spfsi" list includes many metabolic enzymes. this suggests an extensive and large scale alteration of the metabolic system in the spf small intestine. it has been reported that inoculation of bacteria into gf mice resulted in profound changes in xenobiotic metabolism  <cit> . an extensive alteration of small intestinal brush border enzymes between gf and ex-gf piglets has also been noted  <cit> . furthermore, a recent paper has suggested a three-way interaction between the immune system, the intestinal metabolism and the microbiota  <cit> .

in this study, in both iqi and balb/c strains, a similar panel of ifn-related genes was affected by jtx treatment. the panels include genes involved in signal pathway of ifn-αinduction/production, such as stat <dig>  isgf3g and irf <dig>  and genes known as "ifn-stimulated genes", which are closely related to ifn-αinduction/production, such as ifit <dig>  g1p <dig> , igtp, ifi <dig>  tgtp, lgals <dig> and rsad <dig>  <cit> . these findings have addressed the possibility that jtx may exert its pharmacological effect via modulating the signaling pathway for ifn production. in particular, irf <dig>  is a rate limiting transcription factor located in the center of a self-amplifying positive feedback loop of massive ifn-α production  <cit> . microbial infection induces phosphorylation of irf <dig> protein, which is then transported into nuclei to strongly induce the expression of ifn-αs and irf <dig> itself. in the presence of a kinase activated by infectious agents, newly synthesized irf <dig> continues to activate the loop resulting in a massive production of ifn-αs. the inducibility of ifn-α production in various tissues/cells and their steady state level of irf <dig> proteins are known to be closely correlated  <cit> . isgf3g  and stat <dig> are two components of isgf <dig>  a signaling complex that transduces the signal from receptors of ifn-α/β and induces the expression of ifn-α-related molecules, including g1p <dig>  stat <dig> and irf <dig>  <cit> . by contrast, the expression of other interferon regulatory factors, such as irf <dig>  irf <dig> and irf <dig>  did not change. indeed, the end-products of the pathway, such as the ifn-αs, α <dig> and α <dig>  were undetectable. these data suggest that jtx treatment by itself does not affect ifn-α expression directly. however, the steady-state expression level of genes responsible for induction of ifn-α synthesis are altered by jtx. thus, once the stimulatory signals are triggered, jtx-treated mice produce altered levels of ifn-α protein. this conclusion has been confirmed by the experiments using an oral interferon inducer, abmp. although pretreatment by jtx did not change the maximum level of ifn-α, the drug did accelerate abmp-induced changes in the production of ifn-α protein.

in the early phase of infectious diseases, the prompt supply of amounts of ifn-α protein effectively eliminates viruses and prevents the dissemination of the infectious agents into the whole body. intriguingly, another kampo medicine, hochuekkito  has been reported to reduce the lethality due to influenza infection not by increasing the total  amount of ifn-α but by accelerating the onset of ifn-α release in the lung  <cit> . it is not known whether the acceleration of ifn-α response by het is mediated via transcriptional up-regulation of the genes involved in ifn-α production, i.e., stat <dig>  isgf <dig> or irf <dig>  it is also unclear whether jtx accelerates infection-triggered ifn-α production or indeed whether the jtx-induced preventive effects against infectious diseases are related to its acceleration of ifn synthesis signaling. in spite of the apparent similarities between het and jtx, beneficial effects of these drugs have been suggested to have different characteristics and responder patients, both clinically and experimentally  <cit> . the comparative investigation of effects of both drugs on viral infection and ifn-α production/degradation signaling pathways is now in progress in our laboratory.

jtx by itself does not increase nor decrease ifn-α production. furthermore, the results of jtx treatment were different among strains/enteric flora status. steady-state levels of ifn-related genes were up-regulated in iqi spf mice but down-regulated in iqi gf and balb/c mice. a stimulation by abmp also exerted opposite effects on ifn-α levels between iqi spf and balb/c mice suggesting an additional, strain-specific regulatory pathway may exist upstream of the isgf <dig> complex. it is yet to be determined whether the down-regulation of ifn-α responses by jtx is involved in the clinical effects of jtx. as well as playing a critical role in defense against viral infections, type i ifn also has a pivotal role at the interface between innate and adaptive immunity. in spite of the marked efficacy of recombinant ifn-α therapy, the cytokine has been reported to be involved in the development or exacerbation of numerous autoimmune phenomena, including a variety of neuropathy syndromes, neuromuscular junction disorders and myopathies  <cit> . jtx displays various immunomodulating activities  <cit> . these effects should be investigated in the scope of a complex interplay of many genetic and environmental factors that influence the balance between normal and aberrant immune responsiveness. the elucidation of mechanism of action by which jtx  exerts its influence on ifn-α synthesis/degradation may lead to the elucidation of a novel regulatory pathway of ifn-α regulation. furthermore, the identification of the target cell population of jtx may contribute to the discovery of a novel type of ifn-α producing cells. we  <cit>  and other researchers  <cit>  have found that colonic ifn-α producing cells may be distinct from authentic plasmacytoid dendritic cells, the well-known ifn-α producer.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, by applying microarray analysis to different strains/status of mice, we have tried to elucidate an essential component of the pharmacological effect of jtx. our results reveal that jtx modulates the potency of ifn-α production by affecting the genes related to the isgf <dig> complex-irf <dig> loop, rate-limiting transcription factors involved in the ifn-α production signaling pathway. we are currently attempting to identify the active ingredients of jtx and elucidate their respective mechanisms of action.
