BACKGROUND
coral reefs are based on the symbiotic relationship between corals and photosynthetic dinoflagellates of the genus symbiodinium, also known as zooxanthellae, and exist within a narrow temperature range. the optimum temperature for adult scleractinian corals is between 25°c and  <dig> °c  <cit> . as climate change becomes an increasing threat to the biosphere, corals are among the first organisms to suffer from the consequences of global warming  <cit> . heat stress in reef-building corals affects the coral hosts and their algal symbionts, but the relative sensitivity of both to thermal stress is uncertain  <cit> . the first visual sign of heat stress to the coral holobiont  is bleaching, i.e. the loss of photosynthetic symbionts  <cit> .

studies on heat stress in adult corals have shown that processes such as ca2+ homeostasis, cytoskeletal organization, cell death, calcification, metabolism, protein synthesis, and heat shock protein activity are affected among others  <cit> . many of the identified genes from these studies code for known stress-responsive proteins that are shared among eukaryotes. furthermore, it has been shown that an increase in temperature leads to oxidative stress in corals  <cit> , with evidence pointing towards photosystem ii of the algal symbiont as the main source of reactive oxygen species   <cit> .

larvae play an important role in coral reef ecosystems as they form the starting point of the bentho-pelagic lifecycle of a coral  <cit> . from a molecular and genetic perspective, coral embryos/larvae represent an interesting system, as many species initially lack endosymbionts. hence, it is possible to measure the effect of temperature on corals without the confounding factor of symbionts and their different physiologies. studies on coral larvae show that increasing temperatures affect fertilization, embryogenesis, development, survival, and settlement  <cit> . however, molecular studies that assess transcriptome-wide changes in gene expression upon increasing temperatures in coral embryos and larvae have not yet been published.

in this study, we exposed newly fertilized azooxanthellate coral embryos of the caribbean species montastraea faveolata  to a range of temperatures: 1) a permissive temperature of  <dig> °c that is known to be non-stressful; 2)  <dig> °c, which is a normal summer seawater temperature in the caribbean sea during the spawning period; and 3) an elevated temperature of  <dig> °c, which has been observed during the late summer of bleaching years such as  <dig>  transcriptomic changes were assayed with microarrays at  <dig> and  <dig> hours after fertilization. based on our analysis of differentially expressed genes we devised a model that proposes that genes that play a role in system perturbation, system maintenance, and system regulation are affected upon heat stress. this study is the first transcriptome-wide analysis of heat stress in coral embryos and our data provide first insights into the relevant genes and adaptive capabilities of coral embryos in light of projected increases in seawater temperatures.

RESULTS
developmental differences
we compared developing coral embryos after  <dig> and  <dig>  hours that were raised at  <dig> °c,  <dig> °c, and  <dig> °c . albeit offset by  <dig> and  <dig>  hours to the samples on the microarray, the developmental stages of these embryos should reflect the embryos that were used for microarray analysis. we were not able to identify developmental differences based on larval morphology in regard to the different temperatures. however, tools for external classification of developmental stages are limited. hence, changes in development probably exist that are not detected morphologically, but confound gene expression nevertheless. studies have shown that some coral species do show faster development upon increasing temperatures, whereas others do not  <cit> .

we found a higher number of misshapen embryos after  <dig> hours at  <dig> °c and  <dig> °c in comparison to embryos kept at  <dig> °c. however, after  <dig> hours, the proportion of misshapen embryos decreased for embryos kept at  <dig> °c and  <dig> °c, and increased for embryos kept at  <dig> °c. negri et al.  <cit>  observed an increase in frequency of abnormalities in embryos of acropora millepora when exposed to temperatures of 32°c or higher, but in our case the number of misshapen embryos was not consistent with an increase in temperature. however, proper larval development is critical for larval settlement, which in turn is required for individuals to be incorporated into a population. we have not followed up development of larvae until settlement, but the number of misshapen embryos indicates that it is a confounding factor to gene expression measurements.

embryo transcriptomes are affected in a time- and temperature-dependent manner
we constructed a radial tree of hierarchically clustered gene expression data to infer relatedness across different temperature regimes and time points . we found that samples clustered according to time point, i.e. all  <dig> hour samples were distant from all  <dig> hour samples. hence, the differences between all temperature treatments for a given time point were much smaller than between temperatures for both time points. we suggest that the stark separation between both time points is attributable to the different developmental stages the embryos were in  rather than differences due to temperature treatment, which is why we decided to not compare directly between time points. a recent study by grasso et al.  <cit>  found that  <dig>  of  <dig>  unique genes were differentially expressed during early coral development. thus, a significant part of the coral embryo transcriptome seems to change during development, which supports the distinctive separation we see between  <dig> and  <dig> hour old embryos.

for the  <dig> hour time point, embryos kept at  <dig> °c and  <dig> °c cluster together and are separated from embryos kept at  <dig> °c. we interpret this pattern as an indication that embryos initially respond similarly to increased temperatures. however, the distance between all  <dig> hour nodes is small. by contrast, after  <dig> hours embryos kept at  <dig> °c cluster together with embryos kept at  <dig> °c and are notably separated from embryos kept at  <dig> °c. this indicates that over time the transcriptomic pattern of embryos kept at  <dig> °c becomes more similar to those raised at  <dig> °c.

molecular signature of temperature increase in coral embryos
we identified a total of  <dig> differentially expressed genes for embryos kept at  <dig> °c after  <dig> hours post fertilization, and  <dig> differentially expressed genes for embryos at this temperature after  <dig> hours. for embryos kept at  <dig> °c, we identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes after  <dig> hours, and  <dig> after  <dig> hours . genes were defined as up- or downregulated in regard to the expression of that gene in the  <dig> °c temperature sample. please note that the fertilization temperature was 30°c, and thus higher than two of the experimental temperatures  and lower than the third . gene expression might be partially affected by this circumstance as larvae at  <dig> °c and 29°c experienced a higher initial incubation temperature, and larvae at  <dig> °c experienced a lower initial incubation temperature. this might especially affect the  <dig> hour time point as larvae were kept at the treatment temperatures for only  <dig> hours. annotated differentially expressed genes were assorted manually into different categories depending on their function or process they are involved in . genes were associated with the following categories: response to stress, response to oxidative stress, apoptosis, immune system, cytoskeleton, proliferation/growth/development, ribosomes/translation, degradation, metabolism, electron transport, transport, signalling, rna, dna, and regulation of transcription . these categories were then assembled into the three main groups of  system perturbation,  system maintenance, and  system regulation. the system perturbation group contained all the genes that became differentially expressed as a direct consequence of temperature exposure, i.e. genes assorted to a response to stress, a response to oxidative stress, apoptosis, cytoskeleton, and the immune system. genes that were assorted to cytoskeleton, proliferation/growth/development, ribosomes/translation, degradation, metabolism, electron transport, and transport were united into the group system maintenance. this group contained all those genes that play roles in housekeeping processes or processes related to continuation of the biology of a cell. all genes that were assorted to signaling, rna, dna, and regulation of transcription were referenced in the group system regulation as these proteins play roles in regulatory processes in a cell.

system perturbation genes
we identified stress-responsive genes such as stress-response protein nst <dig> , universal stress protein , drought-induced protein rdi , recombination repair protein  <dig> , and senescence-associated protein  among others. we found a consistent down-regulation of members of the scrips gene family across all time points and temperatures analyzed. this gene family has only been recently identified  <cit> , and has been shown to be downregulated upon thermally induced bleaching in m. faveolata  <cit> .

we did not identify a significant upregulation of heat shock proteins  at any time point and temperature. this could be due to a maximum temperature increase of up to  <dig> °c. most studies on proteins have not reported the expression of heat shock proteins at temperatures lower than 33°c  <cit> . in addition, our arrays contained only homologs of a 90-kda heat shock protein   and a  <dig> kda heat shock protein . both genes displayed higher expression in embryos kept at  <dig> °c after  <dig> hours, but not significantly so . we did, however, identify heat shock transcription factor  <dig>  to be upregulated after  <dig> hours at  <dig> °c. heat shock transcription factors  regulate the induction of many hsps and other proteins  <cit> . in particular, hsf <dig> has been indentified as the primary transcription factor responsible for the transcriptional response to heat stress in mammalian cells  <cit> . in addition, our set of differentially expressed genes indicated increased rates of protein misfolding, degradation, and dna damage as stated in succeeding sections. hence, we assume that the treatment temperatures applied were high enough to have structural effects on nucleic acids and proteins. this in turn suggests that both temperatures,  <dig> °c and  <dig> °c, are stressful, and that rather the buffering capacity of heat shock proteins was being compromised in this experiment.

in the category response to oxidative stress we found a high overlap among the upregulated genes after  <dig> hours for embryos kept at  <dig> °c and  <dig> °c. at both temperatures cytochrome p <dig> , soma ferritin , catalase , and peroxidasin-like protein  were upregulated as a consequence of exposure to increased temperatures. the upregulation of oxidative stress genes indicates that, as in adult corals, an increase in temperature leads to oxidative stress in coral embryos  <cit> . whereas cytochrome p <dig>  soma ferritin, and catalase displayed a similar change in expression at both temperatures, peroxidasin-like protein was highly upregulated  in embryos exposed to  <dig> °c. peroxidasin is a supposedly multifunctional protein that plays a role in several biological processes such as oxidation reduction, removal of apoptotic cells, and cross-linking and stabilizing of the extracellular matrix  <cit> . we suggest that peroxidasin-like protein might provide a useful candidate as a coral heat stress biomarker for the following reasons: 1) peroxidasin-like protein seems to be concordantly upregulated in embryos exposed for prolonged periods of time to elevated temperatures, 2) it showed a difference in upregulation depending on the temperature level that embryos were exposed to which gives rise to the possibility to not only assess current stress levels, but past stress levels, and 3) it has been shown to be upregulated upon heat stress in adult coral  <cit> . further studies on peroxidasin-like protein with a higher number of samples and coral species must be conducted in order to yield insights into the identity and applicability of this protein as a heat stress biomarker.

we find evidence for activation of apoptosis upon exposure to increased temperatures. we identified a homolog of activating transcription factor  <dig>  to be upregulated after  <dig> hours for both temperatures, and after  <dig> hours for embryos raised at  <dig> °c. this gene plays an essential role in cell growth, survival and apoptosis  <cit> . moreover, we identified a number of downregulated apoptosis-related genes, mainly in the late time point. the genes were autophagy-related protein  <dig> , calreticulin , and proapoptotic caspase adapter protein . downregulation of calreticulin has been shown to activate oxidative stress and cell death  <cit> . similarly, downregulation of proapoptotic caspase adapter protein  has been shown to expose neuronal cells to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis  <cit> .

system maintenance genes
differential expression in developmental- and growth-related genes could be a consequence of differences in development for a given time point. for this reason, we decided that the implication of differentially expressed genes of this category remains to be elucidated. nevertheless, downregulation of calmodulin  has been shown to be a sign of oxidative stress  <cit> . furthermore, we detected downregulation of ribosomal and translation-associated proteins. downregulation of ribosomal proteins as a consequence of heat shock has been shown in drosophila melanogaster and yeast  <cit> . most of the genes in the category degradation were ubiquitin-related genes. protein degradation is considered a general consequence of heat stress as elevated temperatures lead to increased rates of misfolding. in accordance with our findings of a downregulation of protein biosynthesis , we found a stronger down- than upregulation of metabolism-related genes. we also found a downregulation of genes related to electron transport in oxidative phosphorylation that might further indicate that metabolism is downregulated. for instance, cytochrome b <dig>  and nadh-ubiquinone oxidoreductase  <dig>  were downregulated across all time points and temperatures, mitochondrial atp synthase f chain  in both time points at  <dig> °c and in the late time point at  <dig> °c.

system regulation genes
we found a homolog of histone h <dig>  consistently downregulated across all treatments and time points, and a homolog of histone h2a.v downregulated after  <dig> hours for both treatment temperatures. histone proteins are post-translationally modified and are part of chromatin-based regulatory mechanisms that modulate the accessibility of genetic information  <cit> . it remains to be determined what the direct consequences of histone downregulation in temperature-treated coral embryos are, but it has been shown that downregulation of histone gene expression is used as a mechanism to prevent cells from further replicating upon dna damage  <cit> .

a number of upregulated genes contained zinc finger motifs. zinc finger proteins comprise the largest family of regulatory proteins in mammals and bind to cognate dna , rna, or protein  <cit> . specifically proteins that use c2h <dig> zinc fingers have been found to recognize histones for acetylation and/or methylation  <cit> . although tempting, it remains to be determined if the histones and zinc finger genes we identified here are functionally connected.

model of heat stress in coral embryos
based on our analysis and assignment of annotated differentially expressed genes, we devised a model of heat stress in coral embryos . upon temperature increase, cells respond with regulation of genes playing a role in system perturbation, system maintenance, and system regulation. heat stress induces differential expression of stress-responsive genes. this in turn results in differential expression of genes involved in the response to oxidative stress as heat stress stimulates the production of ros  <cit> . high levels of oxidative stress in turn have been linked to programmed cell death pathways and cytoskeletal changes  <cit> . furthermore, heat stress causes a general downregulation of metabolic processes in coral embryos. as a consequence, ribosome biosynthesis, metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation are downregulated. these processes are all interconnected. additionally, heat stress causes misfolding of proteins, which in turn affects the regulation of the protein degradation machinery. on an upstream level, histone proteins regulate downstream gene expression, and zinc finger proteins might modify those in turn. please note that this model is based on incomplete transcriptomic data and manual assortment of differentially expressed genes, and therefore subject to change. furthermore, due to logistical constraints, we were not able to include true biological replicates. ideally, three to five independent replicated cultures should have been analyzed per treatment and time point to evaluate the potentially contribution of so-called "jar effects"  into the observed gene expression variation. although jar effects represent a problem for our analysis, we hope that most of the observed gene expression patterns represent the true response to the treatments, because 1) our results are in correspondence with results from other heat stress studies in other organisms, 2) we find a stronger stress response in larvae treated at higher temperatures, and 3) a similar study that we conducted with acropora palmata larvae in which we did assay biological replicates gave similar results . we therefore acknowledge that implications drawn from these data are limited and follow-up studies  with proper biological replication are necessary to validate results and conclusions presented here. future efforts should concentrate on comparing transcriptomic responses to different stressors in coral embryos in order to identify a set of common and specific key response genes. these key genes could then serve as a repository for stressor-specific biomarkers as well as for research into coral-specific adaptations to stress responses and global climate change.

CONCLUSIONS
our aim was to look at differential gene expression in coral embryos at temperatures that are known to be non-stressful to corals  in comparison to 1) late summer temperatures during spawning that corals seem to tolerate  and 2) elevated late summer temperatures observed during years when adult bleaching is more pronounced . for this reason, we exposed our embryos to a more constant and gentle increase in water temperature rather than a short term heat shock. despite the lack of biological replicates in this study, our data indicate that effects of temperature on coral embryos depend on the duration and the degree of temperature change. embryos at  <dig> °c are physiologically responsive and show expression of stress-related genes, but seem to be able to counteract the temperature situation over time. embryos at  <dig> °c, however, are not able to recover during prolonged exposure periods and continuously express stress-related genes.
