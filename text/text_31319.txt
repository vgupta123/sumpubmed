BACKGROUND
xanthomonads are plant-associated bacteria that establish neutral, commensal or pathogenic relationships with plants. bacteria belonging to the genus xanthomonas are known to be exclusively plant-associated organisms and do not colonize durably other niches. globally, xanthomonads infect a wide range of economically important crops such as rice, banana, citrus, bean, tomato, pepper, sugarcane, and wheat. more than  <dig> monocotyledonous and  <dig> dicotyledonous plant species are hosts of xanthomonads  <cit> . the large host range of the genus strikingly contrasts with the typically narrow host range of individual strains that is restricted to one or several species of a botanical family  <cit> . indeed, besides their very homogeneous phenotype, xanthomonads differ mainly by their host specificity. this is illustrated in the pathovar infrasubspecific division, which clusters bacterial strains causing similar symptoms on a same host range  <cit> .

the common blight of bean , caused by x. axonopodis pv. phaseoli and x. fuscans subsp fuscans , is the most devastating bacterial disease of bean and one of the five major diseases of bean  <cit> . it causes significant yield loss that can exceed 40% . seed quality losses impact not only bean production but also seed industry worldwide. its wide geographical distribution is presumed to be due to an efficient seed transmission. cbb affects seed and pod production and marketability of common bean  but also lima bean , tepary , scarlet runner bean , and several species belonging to vigna <cit> . bean is a major crop all around the world; in the americas and in africa, bean is a staple crop and constitutes one of the main sources of protein for human  and animal feeding  <cit> . bean was domesticated independently in mesoamerica and in the southern andes more than  <dig>  years ago  <cit> . low to moderate levels of cbb resistance have been identified in a few common bean genotypes from the mesomerican gene pool, whereas no resistance has been identified in the large-seeded andean gene pool  <cit> . the tepary bean possesses the highest level of resistance, whereas only low levels of resistance have been found in common and scarlet runner beans  <cit> . these resistances have been introgressed into common bean breeding lines but with little success into common bean cultivars of any market class  <cit> . to date, at least  <dig> different cbb resistance qtls have been reported across all eleven linkage groups of common bean  <cit> .

x. axonopodis pv. phaseoli and xff colonizes both vascular tissues and parenchyma of their host. cbb agents survive epiphytically until favorable conditions for infection are reached  <cit> . these bacteria are well adapted to survive harsh phyllosphere conditions following epiphytic aggregation in biofilms  <cit> . penetration through stomata is thought to lead to bacterial colonization of the mesophyll, causing leaf spots. bacteria progression inside the host leads to the colonization of vascular tissues, but the wilting of the plant is observed only in severe cases of infection  <cit> . main cbb symptoms are spots and necrosis, which appear on leaves, stems, pods and seeds. they are especially severe in tropical wet regions  <cit> . bacterial ooze may be encountered especially on stems and pods, providing inoculum for secondary spread. in seeds, spots can be distributed all over the seed coat or restricted to the hilum area. most notably, contamination occurs on plants and seeds that are symptomless, raising concerns about pathogen transmission  <cit> .

many important pathogenicity factors have been described for xanthomonads. to establish themselves successfully in host plants, xanthomonads first adhere to the plant surface, invade the intercellular space of the host tissue, acquire nutrients and counteract plant defense responses. the secretion of effectors into the extracellular milieu or directly into the host cell cytosol leads to successful host infection. the virulence factors allowing xanthomonads to complete these steps include adhesins, eps, lps, degradative enzymes and type three effectors   <cit> . cbb agents are known to secrete several fimbrial and non-fimbrial adhesins, some of which are involved in aggressiveness  <cit> . the mucoid appearance of xap and xff bacterial colonies is an indication of xanthan production, which is under the regulation of the diffusible factor dsf . the role of the hrp-type three secretion system  in infection and bacterial transmission to seed has been previously demonstrated  <cit> . a specific repertoire of  <dig> to  <dig> t3es per strain of xap and xff strains has been determined  <cit> . however, a comprehensive characterization of all virulence factors in cbb agents remains to be proposed, and the genome deciphering of xff and xap strains is a first step in this direction.

cbb was first described in  <dig> and the taxonomy of infecting strains is still debated since they are genetically diverse but share a common host  on which they induce the same range of symptoms. among these strains, some produce a brown pigment on tyrosine-containing medium, therefore are called fuscous strains. the pigment results from the secretion and oxidation of homogentisic acid , an intermediate in the tyrosine catabolic pathway  <cit> . these strains are referred to as variant fuscans and are usually highly aggressive on bean  <cit>  although the pigment itself has not been directly associated with pathogenicity  <cit> . up to  <dig>  fuscous and non-fuscous strains responsible for cbb were grouped in a single taxon, namely, x. campestris pv. phaseoli. genetic diversity of strains responsible for cbb was demonstrated by rep-pcr  <cit> , aflp  <cit>  and recently by mlsa  <cit> . three genetic lineages  are phylogenetically closely related and belong to rep-pcr group  <dig>  <cit>  while gl <dig> is phylogenetically distant and belongs to rep-pcr group  <dig>  <cit> . following taxonomical revision of the xanthomonas genus, this pathovar was transferred to x. axonopodis, fuscous strains forming a variant within this pathovar  <cit> . the current taxonomically valid nomenclature for the strains responsible for cbb is xanthomonas fuscans subsp. fuscans  for the fuscous strains, and xanthomonas axonopodis pv. phaseoli for the non-fuscous strains  <cit> . fuscous strains were first isolated by burkholder from beans grown in switzerland in  <dig>  <cit>  and have been isolated from every bean production area throughout the world since this date. the strain 4834-r is a highly aggressive strain that was isolated from a seed-borne epidemic in france in  <dig>  <cit> .

twelve complete genome sequences of xanthomonas are currently available and more than  <dig> draft xanthomonas genomes  are deposited in public databases. altogether, genomes are available for strains representing  <dig> pathovars spanning over  <dig> xanthomonas species. most of the sequenced strains are pathogenic to five plant taxa . no complete fully assembled genome sequence is yet available for any xanthomonads pathogenic to legumes. however the draft sequence of x. axonopodis pv. glycines strain 12– <dig>  a pathogen of soybean, was recently made available . common characteristics of previously released xanthomonas genomes are to hold a great number of genes encoding proteins devoted to plant environment recognition such as methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein  and other sensors, to plant substrates exploitation such as tonb-dependent transporters  and cell wall-degrading enzymes , and to manipulation of plant defense machinery such as t3es  <cit> . these bacteria contain genes encoding the six types of protein secretion systems so far described in gram-negative bacteria. all these γ-proteobacteria are motile by a single polar flagellum. motility is an important feature involved in plant colonization and is often considered as a pathogenicity factor. one motif of the bacterial flagellum  is a microbial-associated molecular pattern  recognized by a transmembrane pattern-recognition receptor  leading to pamp-triggered immunity   <cit> . bean is known to harbor a fls2-like gene, which expression is regulated following fungal infection  <cit> .

here, we provide the first whole-genome sequence of a xanthomonas pathogenic on legumes. the high quality fully assembled and manually annotated genome sequence of x. fuscans subsp. fuscans strain 4834-r  reveals a strong potential for adaptation to versatile environments, which appears to be a hallmark for xanthomonads.

RESULTS
xff 4834-r presents the classical general features of xanthomonads genomes
a high quality fully assembled sequence of the genome of xff 4834-r was obtained by combining 454gs-flx titanium pyrosequencing , illumina 36 bp  and sanger  sequencing. the genome of xff 4834-r is composed of a circular chromosome and three extrachromosomal plasmids  with a total size of  <dig>  <dig>  bp . the average gc content of xff 4834-r chromosome is  <dig> %, while average gc content of plasmids a, b and c are  <dig> %,  <dig> % and 60%, respectively. this high gc content is a common characteristic of most genera within the xanthomonadaceae family  <cit> . the circular chromosome gc skew pattern is typical of prokaryotic genomes with two major shifts located near the origin and terminus of replication. the dnaa gene, which encodes a replication initiation factor promoting the unwinding of dna at oric, defines by convention the origin of the chromosomal sequence of xff 4834-r. annotation of the xff 4834-r genome sequence revealed a total of  <dig>  putative protein-coding sequences ,  <dig> pseudogenes,  <dig> insertion sequences ,  <dig> trna and six rrna genes. the rrna genes  are typically organized in two identical operons localized  <dig>  bp apart. this genetic organization is a common characteristic of the other xanthomonas strains sequenced , with the exception of x. albilineans, which presents a reduced genome  <cit> .

of the  <dig>  manually annotated cdss,  <dig>  have been assigned to putative functions based on homology with other known proteins and functional domain analyses . overall, automatic identification of clusters of orthologous groups of proteins  did not reveal any major difference in functions predicted in xff 4834-r genome compared to the genomes of other xanthomonas sp. .

xanthomonads pan-genome and comparative genomics
the pan-genome of a bacterial genus, species or group of strains is composed of a core genome  and a dispensable genome consisting of partially shared and strain-specific genes  <cit> . the dispensable fraction reflects the diversity of the group and may contain genes involved in the diversity of lifestyles  <cit> , xanthomonas pathogenicity, and adaptation to host and tissues  <cit> . based on the phylogeny of the xanthomonas genus  <cit>  and the quality of the genomic sequences, we chose  <dig> other genomes to perform comparative genomics analyses with xff 4834-r . these strains were chosen to represent different lifestyles and different host / tissue specificities.

more than 80% of cdss unique to xff 4834-r encodes hypothetical proteins
the  <dig> genomes of xanthomonas have various sizes  and totalize  <dig>  cdss. this xanthomonas pan-genome includes orthologs, paralogs, and cdss that are specific of each strain . the core genome of the  <dig> xanthomonas genomes contains  <dig>  groups of orthologs , which are defined as copy-unique genes present in every genome and also  <dig> groups of homologs , which are conserved in all strains but have at least one in-paralog in at least one strain. the xanthomonas core genome represents in average 30% of any xanthomonas genome. this value is high compared to the core genome size of the highly diverse lactobacillus, which represents approximately 15% of any lactobacillus genome  <cit> . the xanthomonas core genome increases to 44% of any xanthomonas genome once x. albilineans strain gpe pc <dig>  is excluded of the analysis. this result is probably due to the markedly reduced genome of xal gpe pc <dig>  <cit>  and to its phylogenetic distance with all other xanthomonas strains used in this study .

the remaining cdss  constitute the dispensable genome . the conserved fraction of the dispensable genome, i.e. cdss present in  <dig> to  <dig> genomes, contains  <dig>  groups of homologs . the variable fraction, i.e. cdss present in five to nine genomes, totalizes  <dig> groups of homologs , whereas rare homologs, i.e. distributed in two to four genomes are in  <dig>  groups . among those, pairwise comparisons of cds contents in the sequenced genomes show a limited number of genes that are shared exclusively between two strains. as expected, the phylogenetically-closest strains share the highest number of cdss . in contrast, xff 4834-r shares several cdss with xal gpe pc <dig>  these genes have been probably acquired by horizontal gene transfert  events . indeed, most of these cds  are located on plasmids; the others being clustered on the chromosome . at least  <dig>  unique cdss and  <dig> specific cdss with paralogs constitute the strain-specific fraction of xanthomonas pan-genome. the number of strain-specific genes is variable within the  <dig> xanthomonas genomes; xff 4834-r displays one of the smallest fractions of specific genes . the specific xff 4834-r cdss mainly encode hypothetical proteins , a feature already observed in other comparative genomics analyses  <cit> . regarding the origin of the xff4834-r specific cdss,  <dig> % have a plasmidic origin and  <dig> % are located in the vicinity of iss. however, only  <dig> % of xff4834-r specific cdss are associated with phage insertion. in addition, some xff 4834-r specific cdss also encode the t3e xopt, several regulators, transporters and secreted proteins . however, increasing the number of xanthomonas genomes in the comparison should decrease the number of xff 4834-r specific cdss observed in this study. for instance, the gene xopt is present in the strains x. oryzae pv. oryzae strain kacc <dig> and maff <dig>  which have not been used in our analysis. moreover, the cdss of the specific fraction of xff 4834-r may be not conserved in other xff-related strains. therefore, the prevalence of xff 4834-r specific genes among large collections of strains deserves further analysis. genomic comparisons provide candidates for further functional studies of xff host colonization

the genome of xff 4834-r was compared to different bacterial genomic sequences in order to identify functions or putative cdss involved in plant pathogenicity and adaptation to different ecological niches . to get insights into functions involved in plant pathogenicity, xylem and parenchyma adaptation, the genome of xff 4834-r was compared to the genomic sequences of a non-pathogenic plant endophytic isolate, sm r551- <dig>  and a xylem-limited plant pathogen, xf temecula  <dig>  both strains belong to the xanthomonadaceae family. xf temecula  <dig> presents a reduced genome and is insect-vectored  <cit> . orthologs shared by xff 4834-r and xf temecula  <dig> differ significantly in riley functional classes  <cit>  in comparison to the whole predicted proteomes . for instance, cdss involved in metabolism are enriched in the orthologous fraction shared between xff 4834-r and xf temecula in comparison with the whole genomes . among them, there are cdss involved in xanthan biosynthesis and several depolymerizing carbohydrates enzymes that could be involved in plant pathogenicity and xylem colonization. orthologs shared by xff 4834-r and sm r551- <dig> also differ significantly in riley functional classes in comparison to the whole predicted proteomes . cdss involved in regulation, transport, chemotaxis and motility are enriched in the orthologous groups shared by xff 4834-r and sm r551- <dig>  these functional categories are generally abundant in metabolically versatile prokaryotes capable of survival in complex and variable environmental niches, especially in nutrient-scarce environments  <cit> . this observation is in agreement with the ability of xff to survive in the phyllopshere  <cit> , an environment which is known to be nutrient-limited  <cit> .

in order to identify functions putatively involved in tissue colonization, the genome sequence of xff 4834-r was compared to the genome sequences of two rice pathogens xoo pxo99a and xoc bls <dig>  while xff colonizes both the vascular system and the parenchyma of its host, xoo pxo99a and xoc bls <dig> colonize specifically the vascular system and the parenchyma of their host, respectively. orthologs shared by xff 4834-r and xoc bls <dig> differ significantly in riley functional classes in comparison to the whole predicted proteomes . for example, cdss involved in regulation , in chemotaxis , in biofilm formation , and in pathogenicity  are enriched in the orthologous groups shared between xff 4834-r and xoc bls <dig>  interstingly, xopaf and xopak were previously suspected to be involved in tissue specificity of xoc bls <dig>  <cit> . orthologs shared by xff 4834-r and xoo pxo99a differ significantly in riley functional classes in comparison to the whole predicted proteomes . cdss involved in transport and of unknown function were enriched. further analyses should give information on their putative role in xanthomonas survival in the vascular system.

comparison of xff 4834-r with two citrus pathogens, xac  <dig> and xfa icpb <dig>  phylogenetically closely related to xff 4834-r should give insights into functions involved in host specificity and xylem adaptation since both xac and xfa are not vascular pathogens . in this comparison, cdss specific of xff 4834-r show a distribution in riley functional classes significantly different  from their distribution in the whole genome and include numerous cdss of unknown function , several t3e encoding genes  and a pectate lyase encoding gene. cdss present in the specific fraction of xff 4834-r could play a role in host specificity, as shown by the abundance of t3es in this fraction. indeed, repertoires of t3es have been already pointed out as candidate determinants of host specificity in xanthomonas <cit> . further studies of cdss specific of xff will confirm if some candidates are involved in bean colonization.

xanthomonads core functions are conserved in xff 4834-r genome
xff 4834-r is fully equipped for sensing the environment
bacteria mainly detect environmental signals through methylaccepting chemotaxis proteins  and sensors of two-component regulatory system . mcps are the principal components of the chemotaxis system. these transmembrane chemoreceptors direct cell locomotion by regulating the histidine kinase chea, which in turn communicates the information to the flagellar motor by phosphorylating its cognate response regulator chey. in xanthomonas, most mcps are clustered in a region dedicated to chemotaxis and motility  <cit> . this cluster is highly similar within xanthomonas with the exception of x. albilineans, which presents a reduced number of genes encoding mcps  <cit> . twelve mcps are scattered on the chromosome of xff 4834-r, among which eleven are also present in xcv 85– <dig> and in most other xanthomonas. the minor differences among xff 4834-r and other xanthomonas chemotaxis clusters concern the absence of xac <dig> and xcv <dig> orthologs in xff 4834-r genome.

tcrss are major signal transduction pathways allowing bacteria to adapt to changing environmental conditions. a typical tcrs consists in a membrane-bound sensor histidine kinase  that perceives external stimuli and a cognate response regulator  that mediates the cellular response. signal is transduced by successive phosphorylation reactions, as for chemotaxis  <cit> . the high number of tcrss in xanthomonas spp. confers to these bacteria a good adaptive potential compared to other bacteria  <cit> . xff 4834-r genome is composed of  <dig> putative tcrss according to their interpro domains and using criteria defined in previous studies  <cit> , including  <dig> transmembrane sensors,  <dig> sensor/regulator hybrids  and  <dig> rrs. the number of xff 4834-r tcrss  is similar to that of xcv 85– <dig>  sixty-two tcrss correspond to pairs of sensor and cognate rr. such an organization by pair is common in xanthomonas and acquisition or loss is reported to occur for both elements at the same time, reflecting a probable process of co-evolution  <cit> .

xff 4834-r is fully equipped for biofilm formation and multiple stress resistance
biofilm formation allows bacteria to resist multiple stresses and requires, at least, attachment of cells and production of exopolysaccharide matrix. these individual characteristics also participate in bacterial virulence. type iv pilus  is known to mediate a large array of functions, including twitching motility, adhesion, microcolony formation, and virulence factors  <cit> . twitching motility occurs through extension, attachment, and then retraction of the t4p. the t4p of xff 4834-r is encoded by a large number of genes grouped in clusters scattered all over the genome with  <dig> out of  <dig> genes grouped in four main clusters. xff 4834-r t4p belongs to t4a family, which is structurally related to type  <dig> secretion system   <cit> . the major pilin subunit pila, as well as three pila-related and one putative minor pilin subunit pile genes are identified in xff 4834-r genome. while synteny and identity are conserved for most genes involved in t4p synthesis among xanthomonas, pilq of xff 4834-r is disrupted by a frameshift . since pilq is essential for type iv pilus secretion across outer membrane  <cit> , it is tempting to speculate that the t4p of xff 4834-r is unfunctional. however, the truncated pilq of xff 4834-r still contained a secretin domain  according to interproscan software, thus suggesting that pilq could still be functional in xff 4834-r. this is in agreement with our previous study, which show that t4p should be functional in xff 4834-r  <cit> . indeed, a mutant deleted in pila displayed altered adhesion capacities on bean seeds relative to wild-type 4834-r, and a decreased aggressiveness. therefore either the frameshift observed in pilq has no major consequences on the protein function, or alternative secretins such as xpsd and or xcsd are recruited.

bacterial attachment, the first step of biofilm formation, depends mainly on adhesion factors such as t4p, type  <dig> pilus, and non-fimbrial adhesins. xff 4834-r genome possesses a cluster of genes encoding a type  <dig> pilus, belonging to γ <dig> fimbrial clade of the chaperon-usher system  <cit>  and sometimes referred to as type  <dig> secretion system  <cit> . this cluster  is highly similar to that of xac  <dig> with two genes encoding the putative pili assembly chaperones, two genes encoding candidate structural fimbrial subunits containing each a spore coat u domain , and one gene coding a predicted usher protein, i.e. an outer membrane protein corresponding to the assembly platform. a conserved secreted hypothetical protein  is also predicted in this cluster as in xcc atcc <dig> genome, i.e. between one gene coding a candidate structural fimbrial subunit and a putative pili assembly chaperone at the end of the cluster.

to date, the only identified non-fimbrial adhesins in xanthomonads are those secreted through one of the three type  <dig> secretion system  subtypes:  monomeric autotransporters   <cit> ,  trimeric autotransporters or oligomeric coiled-coil adhesins   <cit> , and  two-partner secretion systems including filamentous hemagglutinins   <cit> . a total of nine adhesins potentially secreted by each of these subtypes are predicted in xff 4834-r genome. the pattern of non-fibrillar adhesins encoded in xff 4834-r genome is highly similar to that of xac  <dig>  <cit>  with two hemagglutinin-like yaph being monomeric autotransporters , two trimeric autotransporters homologous to yada , one hemolysin called fhac , and three filamentous hemagglutinins secreted through the two-partners pathway . one putative hemagglutinin , highly similar to heca, may be non-functional as a frameshift was confirmed in the c-ter part of the predicted peptide . functional evidence of the involvement in in vitro or in planta adhesion, biofilm formation, and virulence so far has been obtained for four of these non-fibrillar adhesins: yaph , xada <dig> , xada <dig> , and fhab   <cit> . they participate in the initial adhesion, three-dimensional structure of the biofilm and as a result, in the epiphytic fitness of the bacterium. a role of anti-virulence factor has been proposed for yaph in order to explain the higher aggressiveness of the mutant deleted of yaph in bean  <cit> .

exopolysaccharide  of xanthomonas are mainly composed of xanthan, polymers of pentasaccharide repeating unit structures carrying at the non-reducing glucose residue a trisaccharide side-chain of varying extent of acylation  <cit> . xanthan gum is the predominant component of the extracellular slime  <cit> , a major component of the biofilm  <cit> . eps are considered as determinants of disease as they induce the water-soaking in the intercellular space  <cit>  and participate in wilt-induction for vascular pathogens  <cit> . involvement in epiphytic fitness of strains belonging to various pathovars has also been demonstrated  <cit> . xanthan is encoded by a cluster of  <dig> gum genes, gumbcdefghijklm <cit> . in xff 4834-r, the gum cluster  is syntenic with those found in other xanthomonas such as xcv 85– <dig>  a single nucleotide insertion in position  <dig> in gumn modifies the reading frame. in consequence, the trab domain of the predicted protein is  <dig> aa truncated compared to functional orthologs in xanthomonas sp. the  <dig> aa sequence in the c-terminal part of the predicted protein differs from those of the functional orthologs and is  <dig> aa longer than for other gumn predicted proteins in xanthomonas sp. the gene gumn is also fragmented in xcv 85– <dig> following the insertion of is <dig>  in xoc bls <dig>  a single base-exchange created a stop codon in the sequence resulting in two peptides . despite the co-transcription of gumn together with gumb-gumm operon in x. oryzae pv. oryzae <cit> , the role of gumn in xanthan biosynthesis is not demonstrated. the smooth aspect of xff 4834-r colonies is consistent with a non-altered production of eps. pseudogenization of gumn had occurred independently in strains as different as xcv 85– <dig>  xoc bls <dig> and xff 4834-r. this raises the question of the involvement of this gene product in the bacterial cycle?

other genes, such as xana  and xanb , also involved in xanthan biosynthesis  <cit> , are present in xff 4834-r as is the recently described xagabc operon   <cit> . nevertheless, it should be noted that this latter cluster may not be functional in xff 4834-r as the first gene of the operon, xaga, is pseudogenized by an early stop codon at its two third of its length. in other xanthomonas, the xaga gene is highly similar to that found in xcc  <dig>  <cit> . the pgaabcd operon of escherichia coli  is another operon known to be involved in the synthesis of polysaccharides. homologs of these genes are found in xff 4834-r genome  and in xac  <dig> but not in xcv 85– <dig> neither in x. campestris genomes. both the pgaabcd of e. coli and the hmshfrs of y. pestis are known to be involved in the synthesis of polysaccharide adhesins required for biofilm formation  <cit> . the role of these various genes in eps biosynthesis and pathogenicity of xff 4834-r remains to be investigated.

the lipopolysaccharide of xff 4835-r and the genomic plasticity of the o-antigen encoding genes
lipopolysaccharide  is one of the major components of the outer membrane  of gram-negative bacteria. this essential component confers peculiar permeability barrier properties to the om, protecting bacterial cell from many toxic compounds. lps is also known to interact with host cells, inducing innate immunity in both plant and animal host  <cit> . lps is an amphipathic molecule consisting of a hydrophobic glycolipid anchor termed lipid a, a hydrophilic polysaccharide portion in the core region and the o-antigen polysaccharide chain  <cit> . cdss  involved in the biosynthesis of lps precursors are clustered, except pgi and galu that are dispersed in the genome  <cit> . the cluster rmlabcd, which contributes also to the biosynthesis of the lps carbohydrate precursors  <cit> , is located downstream of ugd <dig> in xff 4834-r. the biosynthesis of the core-lipid a complex requires the convergent biosynthetic pathways of kdo2-lipid a portion of lps and of lps outer-core involving nine and four genes, respectively  <cit> , all present on the xff 4834-r chromosome. the eight cdss involved in the assembly and transport of lps in gram-negative bacteria  <cit>  are also present in xff 4834-r genome .

the genomic plasticity associated with the o-antigen cluster is in accordance with previous comparative genomic studies  <cit>  and might be due to intense diversifying selection and/or to hgt. indeed, genes involved in o-antigen synthesis are present in a highly variable gene cluster and can be classified into three different groups:  o-unit-processing genes,  genes involved in the synthesis of nucleotide sugars specially used as o-antigen residues, and  genes encoding sugar transferases  <cit> . as in few strains of e. coli, xanthomonas strains seem to process o-units via an abc transporter pathway that involves wzt and wzm  <cit> . however, wzt and wzm homologs in xanthomonas strains display considerable variation ranging from  <dig> to 92% identities at the amino acid level, which is not in accordance with the phylogenetic relationships of the strains. furthermore, the xff 4834-r genes of the o-antigen precursors gmd and rmd are only shared with x. axonopodis pv. malvacearum, xg atcc <dig>  xcc atcc <dig> and xcv 85– <dig>  distribution of sugar transferase genes is even more diverse in xanthomonas strains. for instance, the bifunctional glycosyl transferases encoded by wbda <dig> and wbda <dig> has only true orthologs in xfa, x. axonopodis pv. malvacearum, x. citri pv. mangiferaeindicae and xcv 85– <dig>  in addition, five genes  are only shared with x. axonopodis pv. malvacearum and xal gpe pc <dig>  the homology of several contiguous cdss of xff 4834-r with those of xal gpe pc <dig>  which is not a closely related organism, may be indicative of an hgt event.

nutrient acquisition and utilization
tonb-dependent transporters  are bacterial outer membrane proteins that allow active high affinity transport of large substrate molecules, among which iron-siderophore complexes, vitamin b <dig>  and various carbohydrates  <cit> . tbdts must interact with an inner membrane protein complex consisting of tonb, exbb, and exbd to get the proton motive force across the inner membrane to transport substrates  <cit> . the genome sequence of xff 4834-r reveals a high number of tbdts  encoding genes. such an overrepresentation of tbdts is common in xanthomonas sp.  <cit> . none of the tbdts is specific of xff 4834-r. most xff 4834-r tbdts have orthologs in xac  <dig> and many of them are conserved in xanthomonads, having also orthologs in xcc atcc <dig>  in xcc atcc <dig>  several tbdts are part of cut  loci comprising also inner membrane transporters, degrading enzymes, and transcriptional regulators  <cit> . a cut locus involved in sucrose utilization  <cit>  is well conserved in xff 4834-r. a second cut locus, involved in the utilization of n-acetylglucosamine  containing substrates  <cit> , is almost complete in xff 4834-r, except for the tbdt encoding gene nixc, which is a pseudogene. however, this latter cut system could be functional as orthologs of three other tbdt encoding genes are present, namely nixa, nixb and nixd. furthermore, orthologs of two other tbdts associated with glcnac in xanthomonas are also present in xff4834-r genome, naxa and naxb corresponding to xff4834r_chr <dig> and xff4834r_chr <dig>  respectively.

finally, the four main cut loci involved in plant xylan scavenging described in xcc atcc <dig> are conserved in xff 4834-r genome  <cit>  the main loci involved in xylan utilization, namely xyta, xylr, xytb and xyle loci, contain genes with putative functional orthologs in xff 4834-r. the only exception is an alpha-d-glucuronidase encoding gene, which is a pseudogene in xff 4834-r . diversity in depolymerizing enzyme gene content within cut loci among strains having different host range may reflect their adaptation to various host plant carbohydrates.

regulation of virulence factors
dsf cell-cell signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of many virulence factors such as eps synthesis, type iii secretion, extracellular hydrolytic enzymes  <cit>  and in the reversion of pathogen-induced stomatal closure  <cit> . this pathway involves a small diffusible signal factor , the dsf synthetase rpff and a tcrs rpfc/rpfg  <cit> . dsf signaling is tightly linked to the intracellular second messenger cyclic dimeric gmp   <cit> . this major gene cluster comprises nine genes in xcc  <dig>  <cit> , while only eight are predicted in xff 4834-r. indeed, rpfi which encodes a regulatory protein in xcc <cit>  is lacking. this is also the case in xcv 85– <dig>  while in xac  <dig> both rpfh and rpfi are lacking  <cit> . xylella fastidiosa shows a partial rpf cluster, which nevertheless plays a key role in regulation and pathogenicity  <cit> . mutation of rpfi does not significantly reduce the virulence of xoo kacc <dig>  <cit> .the rpf pathway is functional in xff 4834-r and as expected an rpff mutant shows an altered eps production and displays rough colonies .

another diffusible signal molecule, df, which was originally identified in x. campestris, was shown to be required for the production of xanthomonadin, eps, systemic invasion, and h2o <dig> resistance, which are various biological processes that are crucial for bacterial survival and virulence  <cit> . df is encoded by xanb <dig> <cit> , a gene belonging to the xanthomonadin biosynthesis pig gene cluster  <cit> , which was recently described as encoding a bifunctional chorismatase that hydrolyses chorismate into 3-hydroxybenzoic acid , the df factor, and 4-hba  <cit> . a xanb <dig> mutant of xff 4834-r presents, as expected, white colonies proving that the df system is functional and involved in xanthomonadin production in this strain . biosynthesis of xanthomonadins is encoded by the pig cluster comprising about  <dig> cdss, which may constitute part of a novel type ii polyketide synthase pathway  <cit> . this pig cluster including xanb <dig> is highly conserved among xanthomonas <cit>  and xff 4834-r did not depart from this rule. gene content is highly conserved between xoo pxo99a and xff 4834-r, with the exception of orthologs to pxo_ <dig> and pxo_ <dig> , which are located 133 kb away from the pig cluster. the yellow-pigmented colonies of xff 4834-r prove that this system is functional.

genes encoding the six types of protein secretion systems are conserved in xff 4834-r
gram-negative bacteria use various basic pathways to secrete proteins, among which virulence factors, and target them to the proper compartment. type i, iii, iv, and vi secretion systems  allow translocation of unfolded proteins directly from the cytoplasm to the outside or directly into the host cell cytoplasm. pathways that translocate polypeptides across the cytoplasmic membrane include general secretory  and twin-arginine  pathways. type ii and v secretion systems  allow crossing the outer membrane from the periplasm. genes encoding these six secretion systems have been identified in xanthomonads strains so far sequenced  <cit> .

the t1ss exports in a single step to the extracellular medium a wide range of proteins of different sizes and activities such as pore-forming hemolysins, adenylate cyclases, lipases, proteases, surface layers, and hemophores  <cit> . the t1ss consists in three proteins: an inner membrane atp binding cassette  protein, a periplasmic adaptor also named membrane fusion protein , and an outer membrane  channel of the tolc family. two sets of genes encoding an abc transporter, a mfp, and an omp are found in clusters in xff 4834-r genome , constituting two putative t1ss. furthermore, the omp tolc  could be associated to three other putative t1ss composed by sets of genes encoding mfp and abc transporters . some t1ss-secreted substrates carry a secretion signal located at the extreme c-terminus  <cit>  and secretion involves a multistep interaction between the substrate and the abc protein that stabilizes the assembled secretion system until the c-terminus is presented  <cit> . one putative substrate of t1ss  carrying  <dig> repetitions of the motif ggxgxdxxx is detected, while  <dig> other putative substrates carry only one repetition of this motif. the role of type  <dig> secreted proteins in xff 4834-r pathogenicity remains to be demonstrated.

because of a similarity in the structure of these systems, multidrug efflux systems  are sometimes considered as t1ss  <cit> . mes are grouped in five families depending on the primary structure and mode of energy-coupling  <cit> . mes belonging to the resistance-nodulation-division  and multidrug and toxic compound extrusion  families contribute significantly to intrinsic and acquired resistance to antimicrobials, but also to accommodate plant-derived antimicrobials  and hence are of special interest for plant pathogens  <cit> . rnd and mate are secondary transport systems, which utilize an electrochemical gradient of cations across the membrane for drug transport. these mes consist in three components: a rnd- or mate-type exporter protein located in the cytoplasmic membrane, a gated omp located in the outer membrane, and a mfp that links the exporter protein with the omp. the drug transport is active and, in rnd family, is driven by the proton motive force, while in mate the drug efflux reaction is coupled with na+ exchange  <cit> . xff 4834-r genome contains seven tripartite rnd-efflux pump system gene operons. four other sets of consecutive rnd exporter and the mfp coding genes could depend on tolc to assemble mes enabling export of drugs  <cit> . two probable mate transporters, including norm, are identified in xff 4834-r genome. in ralstonia solanacearum, the rnd pump acra and the mate pump dinf contribute to its overall aggressiveness, probably by protecting the bacterium from the toxic effects of host antimicrobial compounds  <cit> . the role of these mes in xff 4834-r as in other xanthomonas remains to be analyzed and described. to be secreted through the t2ss and t5ss, proteins are first exported into the periplasmic space via the universal sec or tat pathways. the machinery of the sec pathway recognizes a hydrophobic n-terminal leader sequence on proteins destined for secretion, and translocates proteins in an unfolded state, using atp hydrolysis and a proton gradient for energy  <cit> . the tat and the sec genes are highly similar in identity and organization to those found in xcv 85– <dig> genome. the sec genes are dispersed all over the genome and secm is absent in xff 4834-r genome as it is in xcv 85– <dig>  microsynteny and similar positions on genomes are conserved for the two t2ss  identified in xff 4834-r genome with orthologous clusters in xcv 85– <dig>  the t3ss encoded by the hrp gene cluster is a key pathogenicity factor in xanthomonads, with the exception of x. albilineans <cit> . it is involved in the secretion and translocation of effector proteins directly into the host cell cytoplasm. in xff 4834-r, the hrp gene cluster is inserted next to an arginine transfer-rna . one copy of isxfu <dig>  is localized at each side of this cluster, which otherwise is almost identical and syntenic to that of other sequenced xanthomonas strains . genes coding the master regulators hrpg  and hrpx  are localized  <dig>  mb away from the hrp cluster. this type iii secretion system was shown to be functional and to play a role in the colonization of bean plants and seeds  <cit> .

t4sss are versatile secretion systems in gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria that secrete a wide range of substrates, from single proteins to protein–protein and protein–dna complexes  <cit> . many of the t4sss found in gram-negative bacteria are similar to that of agrobacterium tumefaciens, which comprises  <dig> proteins, named virb <dig> to virb <dig> and vird <dig>  <cit> . t4sss have been identified in xanthomonads and have been especially well studied in xac  <dig>  <cit> . two t4ss are present in xac  <dig>  one found on a plasmid and the second one on the chromosome  <cit> . despite the fact that both systems belong to the same p-like t4ss group  <cit> , the two t4ss of xac  <dig> do not share either the same genetic organization nor high sequence identity at the protein level  <cit> . in xff 4834-r, only the chromosomal t4ss is complete. putative virb <dig> and virb <dig> are found on plasmid b and could be remnants of a plasmidic t4ss.

the t6ss is a recently characterized secretion system that appears to constitute a phage-tail-spike-like injectisome that has the potential to introduce effector proteins directly into the cytoplasm of host cells. it has been identified in many bacteria infecting plants or animals, but also in bacteria found in marine environments, the soil/rhizosphere, and in association  with higher organisms  <cit> . in xanthomonads strains, up to two t6ss clusters have been reported. they are assigned to three different types  <cit> . xff 4834-r contains a single t6ss belonging to the group  <dig>  which presents a kinase/phosphatase/forkhead phosphorylation-type regulator and an arac-type regulator. this is also the case for x. vesicatoria <cit> .

xff4834-r displays a large repertoire of cwdes
a large repertoire of t <dig> secreted degrading enzymes with various activities  is identified in xff 4834-r genome. these enzymes are suspected to degrade host plant tissues. orthologs of these  <dig> secreted enzymes and three pseudogenes are found in the genomes of other xanthomonas sp., none seeming to be specific of xff 4834-r. orthologs of most cwde described in potnis et al. <cit> , or type ii secretion substrates described in szczesny et al. <cit>  are identified in xff 4834-r genome. it should be noticed that no orthologs of xync , pel3a and pel10a <cit> , nor of xyn30a, xyl39a and gly43c <cit>  are found in xff 4834-r genome and that there are frameshifts in agu67a  and xyn51a . interestingly, these five latter enzymes have been identified in the xylem-invading bacterium xcc. the  <dig> -β cellobiosidase cbha is supposed to be required for bacteria to spread within xylem vessels  <cit> . while xff 4834-r is known to colonize xylem vessels  <cit> , no ortholog of cbha has been found in its genome. in most xylem-invading xanthomonadaceae engxca harbors a cellulose-binding domain  at its c-terminal extremity and a long linker region, which are known to enhance substrate accessibility  <cit> . xff 4834-r possesses one gene encoding engxca , which however presents apart the cbd domain a relatively short linker domain . moreover, the orthologs of x. albilineans genes coding cels and xalc_ <dig> present neither long linker regions nor cbd in xff 4834-r genome. this is also the case for other xanthomonas <cit> . such differences in depolymerizing enzyme content between these two xylem-invading bacteria  and xff may reflect a relatively limited ability of xff to colonize xylem vessels, which is in accordance with infrequent vessel obstructions, necrosis, and wilting symptoms.

xff 4834-r harbors a specific repertoire of putative t3es
to mine for the presence of genes coding candidate t3es , we first blasted on the genome of xff 4834-r the sequence of all known t3es genes listed on the xanthomonas.org website. such a mining of the genome of xff 4834-r predicts  <dig> genes encoding t3e orthologs , thereby revealing a t3e repertoire larger than previously described  <cit> . most genes encoding t3es are located in the chromosome; only  <dig> genes encoding t3es are plasmidic . as well, a pseudogene similar to the 5’-end of xopf <dig> and an extra pseudogenized version of xopad may be found on the chromosome. among the genes encoding t3es found in the genome of xff 4834-r, six have orthologs in all sequenced strains of xanthomonas possessing an hrp-t3ss. based on such an observation, a core effectome of the genus featuring xopn, xopq, xopf, xopx, avrbs <dig> and xopp <dig> can be defined.
xff 
4834-r genome and their characteristics

many t3es are located in the vicinity of various types of mobile genetic elements such as iss or integrases in xff 4834-r genome . interestingly, the locus carrying xopg contains numerous iss on both sides of xopg. this locus is found in the vicinity of trna genes. such genetic organization is also observed in other xanthomonas genomes including xcv 85– <dig> and xcc b <dig>  interestingly, in the genome of xcc  <dig>  xopg is pseudogenized and only one is can be found flanking xopg on one side. in the genome of 4834-r, xopg displays a significant gc bias since the average gc content dropped to  <dig> %. the predicted xopg protein belongs to the m <dig> family of metalloproteases. two cdss are located between xopg and isxfu <dig>  these cdss display a gc content of  <dig> and 60% respectively, which remains lower than the average value in the rest of the genome . the cds xff4834r_chr <dig> encodes a putative glyoxalase that may participate in stress resistance. the cds xff4834r_chr <dig> encodes a protein that shares structural similarity with peptidases from the m <dig> family. altogether, this suggests that xopg is carried by a small pathogenicity island that could be transferred by hgt.

the genome of xff 4834-r also features a cds resembling the n-terminal part of xopf <dig>  right upstream a complete allele of xopf <dig>  such cds may constitute an orphet for terminal reassortment of novel t3es  <cit> . as well, on the positive strand, cdss xff4834r_chr <dig> and xff4834r_chr <dig> encode truncated c-terminal and n-terminal parts of xopad, respectively. these cdss are located right upstream a full copy of xopad. the n-terminal part of xopad features numerous repeats of a 42-residue motif identified as skwp repeats. the n-terminal part of the full version of xopad differs from xff4834r_chr <dig> by three indels covering five entire repeats. on the contrary, cds xff4834r_chr <dig> shares 100% identity at the amino acid level with the c-terminal part of the full xopad copy. such an observation suggests that cdss xff4834r_chr <dig> and xff4834r_chr <dig> constitute two functional domains that may evolve separately. the c-terminal part may then be reassorted with various n-terminal parts.

plant-inducible promoters, also called pip-boxes, are cis-regulatory motifs recognized by the transcriptional activator hrpx that controls the expression of t3ss and t3es  <cit> . pip boxes are located between  <dig> and 32 bp upstream the - <dig> motif of the promoter  <cit> . therefore, to mine for potentially novel candidate t3es and genes expressed in an hrpx-dependent manner in the genome of xff 4834-r, we identified the occurrence of the previously described pip-boxes and - <dig> motifs  <cit> . pip-boxes matching the previously described patterns could be identified upstream xopa, xopam, xopaf xope <dig>  xopj <dig>  xopj <dig>  xopk, and xopr. the putative pip boxes upstream xopa, xopam, xopaf, xopj <dig>  xopj <dig>  and xopr were located far upstream the translational start codon of the respective cds . such an observation suggests the occurrence of very long 5’-utrs for these genes, as already observed by schmidtke et al.  <cit> .

looking at cdss downstream putative pip-boxes may reveal sequences corresponding to yet unidentified t3es, as well as functions co-regulated with type iii secretion . among cds found downstream pip boxes, cds xff4834r_chr <dig>  encoding a putative serine/cysteine protease, could be a good candidate t3e. genes coding for two putative polygalacturonases and a secreted lipase may be found downstreal pip boxes, suggesting that cell wall degradation is co-regulated with type iii secretion. cell to cell bacterial communication may also be partly co-regulated with the type iii secretion. indeed, the gene trpe encoding a probable anthranilate synthase component is also found among genes located downstream putative pip-boxes. the involvement of anthranilate synthases in the production of quorum signals controlling the production of virulence factors was recently documented in pseudomonas aeruginosa <cit> .

eight types of insertion sequences  are present in xff 4834-r genome
a total of  <dig> is copies are present in the genome of xff 4834-r. among those, only  <dig> appear to be complete  and are split into five isoforms: isxax <dig> <cit> , isxfu <dig> , isxfu <dig> , isxcd <dig> , and isxac <dig> <cit> , and three types of degenerated iss   <cit> . isxfu <dig> has not yet been identified in any other sequenced genome but an isoform was previously sequenced  from another bean-associated xanthomonads strain. there are  <dig> insertions or remnants of isxfu <dig> found all over xff 4834-r chromosome, none are plasmidic. there are  <dig> insertions of isxfu <dig> in xff 4834-r genome. no complete copy of isxfu <dig> is identified so far in other xanthomonads genomes. however, exact copies of the transposase txfu <dig> are present in xfa icpb <dig> translated genome.

overall, xff 4834-r contains more iss than xac  <dig>  <cit>  and less iss than x. oryzae strains  <cit> . isxax <dig> is the most abundant is in xff 4834-r genome and belongs to is256-family  <cit> . members of this family are plasmidic in xac  <dig> and xcv 85– <dig> but are present in multiple chromosomic copies in the four sequenced strains of x. oryzae <cit> . integration and dissemination of isxax <dig> in xff 4834-r chromosome may have occurred with the partial integration of pxcv <dig> plasmid .

furthermore,  <dig> remnants of iss belonging to several families are also inserted in xff 4834-r genome . these degenerated elements are probably not functional anymore. most remnants colocalize with other is elements. these interdigitations of various intact or partial is elements has been noted repeatedly in the literature  <cit>  this may reflect the scars of consecutive but isolated transposition events resulting from selection for acquisition or loss of accessory genes.

occurrence of other mobile genetic elements inserted into the chromosome of xff 4834-r
several predicted viral dna genes and fragments are found all over the genome of xff 4834-r . a dna region of more than  <dig>  bp contains  <dig> cdss of phage-related proteins including one copy of the ϕlf filamentous phage. the cds  coding the integrase of the ϕlf phage  <cit>  is disrupted indicating that the protein should not be functional anymore. two contiguous and symmetric copies of this phage are found in xcc atcc <dig> genome  <cit> . in xff 4834-r downstream of the complete ϕlf insertion, a truncated copy of ϕlf “orf112” is found contiguous to two consecutive insertions of isxax <dig>  this suggests that isxax <dig> insertions could be posterior to ϕlf integration and could have deleted most part of the second ϕlf integration, from which only the truncated “orf112” remained.

in addition, a chromosomal dna region of more than  <dig> kb contains cdss that are orthologous to cdss of plasmidic origin in other xanthomonas. half of this region  is syntenic to a part of pxcb from x. citri pv. aurantifolii strain b <dig>  <cit> , and  <dig> cdss are syntenic to a part of pxcv <dig> from xcv 85– <dig>  some cdss of these two parts of the native plasmids are orthologous but the copies found in xff 4834-r genome have higher identities with pxcv <dig> copies , suggesting that they originate from pxcv <dig> rather than pxcb. it is worthwhile to mention that pthb from pxcb is not conserved in xff 4834-r while its two adjacent cdss are. this t3e, pthb, is required to cause cankers on citrus  <cit> . however, the gene encoding another t3e, xopaf, is inserted in this region together with isxax <dig> and isxfu <dig>  orthologs of both xopaf and txfu <dig> are found by blastp only in xfa icpb <dig> genome. the association xopaf –isxax <dig> is unique to xff 4834-r and is not found in other xanthomonads genomes. isxax <dig> is present in the native pxcv <dig>  <cit>  and hence could have transposed from this plasmid during its integration into xff 4834-r chromosome.

mobile genetic elements co-localize with two major chromosomal inversion events, one large dna deletion event, and various gene insertions
half of the is insertion events are distributed all over the genome while the other insertions are grouped in spots of two to six iss . this non-random distribution of is elements is common in bacterial genomes  <cit> . isxfu <dig> is involved in  <dig> is hot spots together with isxax <dig> and in a lesser extent with isxfu <dig> and other is remnants. five other is spots involved only isxfu <dig>  isxax <dig>  and is remnants. xff 4834-r iss are associated with two major chromosomal inversion events, one large dna deletion event, various gene transfers, and several gene breakdowns.

two major chromosomal inversions co-localize with isxfu <dig> and isxfu2
a dramatic pattern of genomic rearrangement consisting in two inversion events involving isxfu <dig> and isxfu <dig> is revealed by comparison with the most closely related assembled genome  . the combination of various sequencing approaches that we used ensures a high quality of the assembly and we can therefore rule out that such an inversion would originate from an error in the assembly. a considerable colinearity exists among xanthomonads genomes allowing inversion events to be easily detected, as was previously observed between xcc atcc <dig> and xcc  <dig>  <cit> . two copies of isxfu <dig>  and two copies of isxfu <dig>  flank the inverted segments that are located symmetrically at mirror image positions across the replication axis. consequently, the gc skew pattern is not altered by these inversions . these inversions result in an inverted order of cdss and coding strand in xff 4834-r compared to the other xanthomonas on the length of these two regions of around 1 mb each .

a large deletion in the flagellar gene cluster in xff 4834-r genome is associated with isxfu2
annotation of the flagellum cluster reveals that a group of  <dig> contiguous genes is lacking in xff 4834-r genome compared to xcv 85– <dig> genome. instead of these genes, a complete copy of isxfu <dig> is inserted in xff 4834-r genome . notably, genes coding for the periplasmic rod and its rings, the hook, and the filament are lacking. these elements are essential for flagellum biosynthesis  <cit> . as suspected in the absence of a functional flagellum, no swimming motility can be observed for this strain in a soft-agar assay . this is a surprising observation, as xanthomonads are known to be motile by means of a single polar flagellum  <cit> . however, as we obtained a high quality fully assembled genome, this fragment absence could not be due to sequencing errors or assembling problems. no such flagellar deletion was observed so far in any other complete assembled genome sequence of any xanthomonads. on the contrary, the flagellar cluster is highly conserved among microbes. in particular, elements such as the flg <dig> peptide are usually described as canonical microbial associated molecular patterns  involved in the induction of the first layers of plant defense  <cit> .

absence of motility is not restricted to the strain xff 4834-r and involves several species within the xanthomonas genus
to determine if the event leading to a non-functional flagellum system is strain specific, pathovar specific or if, in contrast, it could be observed in other species of the genus, markers of the integrity of the flagellar cluster were searched for in several collections. to do so, seven consensus primers pairs  were designed and used for pcr-amplification of genes regularly dispersed all over xcv 85– <dig> flagellar cluster .

acollection of  <dig> strains, mostly type strains representing most species and numerous pathovars within the xanthomonas genus except cbb agents was intially used. for most strains, signals at the expected sizes were generated indicating that these strains should harbor complete flagellar cluster. however, some pcr were negative for seven strains that belong to six different species . since several pcr tests were negative in each strain, this strongly indicates that one or several groups of genes could be missing. different patterns of deletions are observed. their impact on motility of strains was tested using soft-agar assays. none of these seven strains are motile . among these, the pathotype strains of x. translucens pv. phlei and x. translucens pv. translucens are not motile . moreover, the genomes of two strains belonging to x. translucens were recently made publicly available and also show partial or entire deletion of the flagellar cluster , suggesting that they are also non-motile. the genome of x. translucens pv. graminis art-xtg <dig> has not one single orthologous gene  of any gene from xcv 85– <dig> flagellar cluster. in the genome of x. translucens pv. translucens dsm  <dig>  six cdss from the flagellar cluster-i encoding protein involved in flagellar structure are lacking, thereby probably altering the motility of the strain  <cit> . the absence of motily could hence occur in a wide range of species or pathovars within the genus xanthomonas.

cds are considered as orthologs  on the basis of an identity of more than 80% on more than 80% of the length of the cds. cds are considered as putative orthologs  when homology is lower or on a shorter length of the cds and if the expected functional domains are identified. on other cases, no orthologs are recorded .

distribution of non-motile strains was also assessed in a collection of  <dig> strains representing the four genetic lineages  of the agents responsible for the common bacterial blight of bean. while 95% of the strains harbor a complete flagellar cluster, eight strains possess an incomplete flagellar cluster . three patterns of deletion were identified. one pattern is found in several strains from the gl <dig> isolated in the americas over a large period of time and another pattern is found in fuscous strains isolated from different places in france over a period of 30 years. absence of motility was, once again, confirmed by phenotyping the strains with soft-agar motility tests .

in order to assess the prevalence of non-flagellate strains in natural environments,  <dig> strains isolated from the same epidemic than xff 4834-r were screened for flagellar cluster integrity and motility. these strains were sampled in the same field than xff 4834-r  and in fields representing the following bean generations . about half of the strains isolated each year is mobile, while the other half is not . this suggests that two populations are cohabiting in these epidemics, one being flagellate and the other not. this suggests that a non-flagellate strain may be fit in the field, at least in mixed populations with flagellate strains, as it can naturally colonize beans and be seed-transmitted over several generations.

signal at the expected size for each primer set  indicates the presence of the marker, while the absence of pcr signal at the expected size  is interpreted as the absence of the gene or allelic diversity and a suspected absence of motility. absence of motility was confirmed by soft-agar motility test as illustrated in figure  <dig> 

all the non-flagellate strains that lack flic obviously also lack flg <dig>  flg <dig> is a major mamp that is recognized by its cognate receptor fls <dig>  thus activating basic host defense responses. since natural populations of xff may be composed of flagellate and aflagellate strains, the size of the population is likely to be underestimated by the plant host due to the lack of recognition of aflagellate strains. therefore, the xff population may overcome host defense and more easily invade its host. however, non-functionality of the flagellar cluster is not a frequent event in xanthomonads indicating that absence of motility could be a negative trait. indeed, chemotaxis plays a major role in virulence of numerous pathogenic bacteria allowing bacteria to gain entry sites  <cit> . it is also likely that chemotaxis and motility play a role in fitness of bacteria outside the host, as in water for example. however, very little is known concerning any aspect of xanthomonads life outside their host. without a functional flagellum, a bacterium cannot rely on chemotaxis to move toward attractants and away from repellants, and cannot locate and infect plant hosts in its natural niches, which could be considered as negative traits in natural environments.

isxfu <dig> is flanking the hrp gene cluster on both sides colocalizing with t3e gene insertions
breaks in synteny occur on both sides of the hrp cluster, in regions where various genes encoding candidate t3es may be found. interestingly, complete copies of isxfu <dig> are located on each side of the hrp cluster of xff 4834-r. such a location coincides with loci displaying variations between genomes of xanthomonas . indeed, on one side of the hrp cluster, the locus located between hpab and hrpf carries a copy of isxfu <dig> and t3e genes: hpa <dig> and xopf <dig>  neither isxfu <dig> nor xopf <dig> and hpa <dig> are present in the genome of xac  <dig>  in xoo pxo <dig>  the isxo <dig> is located at the same locus as isxfu <dig> in xff 4834-r. in xoc bls <dig>  this locus features a large insertion that carries carbohydrate degradation operons, virulence genes such as the t3e gene xopad, tat genes, and transposases next to the trna-arg. on the other side of the hrp cluster of xff 4834-r, another copy of isxfu <dig> is located between hrcc and xopa. in xcv 85– <dig>  is <dig> is located at the same locus, as well as xopd and two genes coding hypothetical proteins. these observations suggest that in xanthomonads genomes, loci flanking the hrp cluster on both sides are prone to the insertion of mobile genetic elements carrying virulence genes, especially t3es and behave as pais  <cit> .

gene rearrangements and insertions associated with mobile genetic elements
integrons and gene cassette arrays are well known in clinical organisms in which they carry antibiotic resistance genes  <cit> . integrons were also described in many bacteria colonizing diverse environments including plants, in which they are supposed to contribute to niche adaptation. identification of chromosomal integrons in xanthomonas is based on the presence of a dna integrase  homolog, a plausible integron-associated recombination site , and a gene cassette array bounded by attc formerly called 59-base element sites. in xanthomonas, integron chromosomal insertion is located adjacent to the acid dehydratase gene, ilvd <cit> . in contrast, the ilvd region in xff 4834-r contains an is hot spot  and several genes having no orthologs in other xanthomonas genomes. however, integron remnants are present elsewhere in xff 4834-r genome . a truncated copy of inti is found  <dig>  mb away in xff 4834-r genome, and adjacent to inti, the atti site flanked by an array of gene cassettes consisting of a single cds and its attc site  <cit>  in xcc atcc <dig> integron, several copies of pigh are present in the cassette array. one pseudogenized copy of pigh is also present in the cassette array of xff 4834-r. the four other cassettes of this array contain genes encoding cryptic hypothetical proteins. contiguous to this region, a spot of  <dig> iss  may be involved in the genomic reorganization of ilvd region explaining the different xff 4834-r integron localizations in comparison to all other sequenced xanthomonas. in these two regions, different genes with low gc% and showing no or partial similarities with genes in other xanthomonas are found together with genes which phylogenies do not follow organism phylogeny . this suggests that these genes may have been acquired by is- and/or integron- promoted hgt.

most gene pseudogenizations result from indel leading to frameshift and stop codons
the availability of a deep sequenced and fully assembled genome for xff 4834-r and of several genomes of closely related organisms gives the opportunity to question pseudogenization. indeed, comparative genomics is a good mean to identify pseudogenes  <cit> . in xff 4834-r genome, the  <dig> events of pseudogenization observed fall into four cases . first, fragments of gene for which the mechanism of pseudogenization is not visible anymore could be detected. fourteen gene fragments initially encoding various functions result from gene erosion by comparison with functional orthologs in other xanthomonads. among them, ψxopf <dig> seems to be a truncated and degenerated copy of xopf <dig>  a t3e encoding gene located downstream. a truncated copy and a complete copy of virb <dig> gene are also present in the genome of xff 4834-r. two truncated copies of virb <dig> are also present in xac  <dig> that both correspond to the n-terminal part of virb <dig>  such a process of gene duplication is described to precede pseudogenization or novel function acquisition in various organisms  <cit> . second, numerous pseudogenizations are due to cds disruption by iss. fifteen xff 4834-r pseudogenes belong to this category and most of them affect genes encoding hypothetical proteins, one element of the t4p, and one small remnant of a non-fimbrial adhesin encoding gene . for one of these pseudogenes, a preceding event of gene duplication seems to have occurred, as this latter pseudogene is located downstream its putative functional copy fhabxff4834r_chr <dig>  orthologous to fhabxac <dig>  third, a sense codon has acquired a point mutation turning it into a stop codon causing premature termination of translation. there are  <dig> xff 4834-r pseudogenes concerned by this kind of in-frame stop. for  <dig> of them, a second peptide corresponding to the c-terminal part of the protein can be predicted. rna sequencing or functional analyses would demonstrate if some of them are still functional and could correspond to the creation of novel genes by fission. gene fission is already known in the case of modular proteins for which fragments containing functional domain fragments can still be considered as genes. this is the case for some tcrss  <cit> . fourth, most putative pseudogenizations  found in xff 4834-r genome correspond to frameshifted genes consecutive to a short insertion or deletion in the sequence leading to heterologous c-terminal amino acids and/or premature termination of translation .

a frameshift in hmga could lead to fuscous pigment production in xff 4834-r
a case of pseudogenization by frameshift is particularly relevant in the case of xff 4834-r, as it explains the abundantly described fuscous phenotype of xff. indeed, xff produce a fuscous pigment due to the disruption of tyrosin catabolism. secretion and subsequent oxidation of homogentisic acid confers this phenotype to xff strains  <cit> . tyrosine is catabolized as part of normal intermediary metabolism and in the breakdown of external proteins by microorganisms. in order to describe the genetic basis of this specificity of xff strains compared to most other xanthomonads, we analyzed the tyrosine degradation pathway . in tyrosine degradation i pathway, tyrosine is converted into fumarate through five reactions. it starts out with the transfer of its amino group to alpha-ketoglutarate by tyrosine-glutamate aminotransferase . the degradation intermediate of this transaminase reaction is 4-hydroxy-phenylpyruvate, which in turn is oxidized in the presence of vitamin c to homogentisic acid. this reaction is catalyzed by 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase . the ring structure of homogentisate is subsequently broken and the linear c <dig> unit degraded in two reaction steps to fumarate and acetoacetate, one citric acid cycle intermediate and one ketone body. based on high sequence similarity with homologs in other xanthomonads, genes of this pathway seem to be functional in the genome of xff 4834-r, with the exception of hmga, the gene encoding the homogentisate oxygenase. interestingly, this gene ψxff4834r_chr <dig> appears to be non-functional in xff 4834-r, due to a frameshift at position  <dig>  instead of a  <dig> residues reported for other hmga, the protein synthetized by xff 4834-r is  <dig> aa long. there are no functional orthologs of this gene in xff 4834-r. correction of this mutation or complementation of xff 4834-r strain with a functional allele would definitely proof that in wild type xff homogentisate could not be degraded in 4-maleyl-acetoactetate and accumulates giving rise to the brown diffusible pigment of xff. indeed, this acid can spontaneously oxidize and polymerize, leading to the formation of pyomelanins  <cit> .

except for pseudogenes related to hgt events, phylogeny of xff 4834-r putative pseudogenes follows the phylogeny of the organisms
in order to get insights into the pseudogene evolutionary history, we compared the phylogenetic tree of every gene family having a pseudogene in xff 4834-r with the phylogeny of six housekeeping genes among the  <dig> genomes used for comparative genomics . two pseudogenes , located in the integron region , have nucleotidic sequences more closely related to xcc atcc <dig> than to xfa icpb <dig> or xac  <dig> . this is consistent with hgt and also with the deleterious impact of integrons on genomes  <cit> . moreover, a third pseudogene  has a phylogeny different from that of the organisms. this pseudogene of unknown function is located in the vicinity of isxax <dig> and then could have been acquired by hgt. the phylogeny of the other pseudogenes follows the phylogeny of the housekeeping genes reflecting a probable recent pseudogenization .

CONCLUSIONS
genomic comparisons and xff 4834-r genome annotation enlighten features involved in plant pathogenicity and adaptation to different ecological niches. we identified  <dig> t3es, including tales, depolymerizing carbohydrate enzymes, sensors of tcrs and chemotaxis, tbdt and many proteins of unknown functions that could be involved in bean adaptation, colonization of xylem and other niches, the role of which remains to be explored. the distribution of these genes in large collections of strains representing the genetic diversity of bean bacterial blight pathogens and allele sequence comparison should reveal their evolutionary history and allow the selection of candidates for further functional analyses.

while xff 4834-r is well adapted to survive in the phyllopshere and to colonize seeds notably through adhesion and biofilm aggregation  <cit>  and is highly pathogenic on bean, genome sequence analysis reveals that this strain lacks a functional flagellum. isolation of such variants from a natural epidemic reveals that either flagellar motility is not a key function for in planta fitness or that some complementation occurs within the bacterial population. mixing of flagellated and non-flagellated cells in population could also be a strategy to avoid detection by plant defense system by reducing the targets.

finally, the sequencing and annotation of xff 4834-r genome allowed the discovery of the genetic basis of the fuscous pigment production, a characteristic of all xff strains. fuscous variants belonging to separate pathovars within xanthomonas are sometimes isolated. it will be interesting to test if the same genetic basis is responsible for these phenotypes that did not fixed in these populations. it shall now be feasible to replace ψhmga by a functional ortholog to identify the role of this pigment in xff fitness.
