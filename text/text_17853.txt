BACKGROUND
huanglongbing  is a destructive disease of citrus production worldwide. all known commercial citrus cultivars are susceptible to hlb. the disease was first noted in chaoshan area in guangdong province of the people's republic of china in the late of 1800s  <cit>  and is currently distributed in  <dig> citrus producing provinces in south china. hlb is now established in sao paulo of brazil  <cit>  and florida of the united states  <cit>  where it poses a great threat to the citrus industry. the disease is associated with three species of non-culturable, phloem-limited, α-proteobacteria: 'candidatus liberibacter asiaticus', 'ca. l. africanus', and 'ca. l. americanus'  <cit> . in both china and u.s., only 'ca. l. asiaticus' has been detected. due to the lack of pure culture, 'ca. l. asiaticus' has been poorly characterized. little is known about the bacterial biology, genetic diversity, and epidemiology.

sequence analyses of conserve genomic loci such as 16s rrna gene and 16s/23s intergenic spacer regions have been used to define 'ca. liberibacter' species  <cit> . however, more variable genomic loci need to be identified to better characterize the bacterium. before the availability of whole genome sequence, bastianel et al.  <cit>  identified an outer member protein gene  to differentiate isolates/strains of 'ca. l. asiaticus' from different geographical origins, although each regions was represented by only one to three strains. tomimura et al.  <cit>  analyzed the single nucleotide polymorphisms  in a bacteriophage-type dna polymerase gene and revealed three clusters of 'ca. l. asiaticus' strains from the southeast asia. all indonesia strains clustered in one group and the other two clusters were not correlated with geographical origins including vietnam, thailand, taiwan, and japan.

the completed genome sequence of 'ca. l. asiaticus' strain psy  <dig> is now available  <cit> . the annotated genome has  <dig>  protein and  <dig> rna coding loci and is readily accessible for genomic analyses. based on the variation of tandem repeat number  at the locus of clibasia_ <dig>  the population of 'ca. l. asiaticus' strains in guangdong of china was found to differ from that in florida of u.s.  <cit> . this analysis of trn also detected the possible presence of two genotypes in florida: a trn <  <dig> genotype that widely distributed statewide and a trn >  <dig> genotype that was limited to central florida. in guangdong, trn variations were more heterogeneous and correlations to geographical origins were not established. a recent report used four tandem repeat loci to analyze 'ca. l. asiaticus' strains from japan, taiwan and indonesia revealed various levels of population diversity, yet correlation to other genotypes or geographical origins was not known  <cit> . more recently, a prophage terminase gene  was used to evaluate population diversity of 'ca. l. asiaticus' in two geographically distinct citrus growing provinces  in china  <cit> . the 'ca. l. asiaticus' populations in these two locations are significantly different in their prophage terminase gene frequencies. in other bacteria, such as escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae and xylella fastidiosa, genomic loci with variable trn or prophage genes are also known to be valuable descriptors of bacterial genetic diversity  <cit> .

this study was to further explore the use of available genomic information for 'ca. l. asiaticus' characterization. we report our observation of dna mosaicism or hyper-sequence variation at the locus of clibasia_ <dig> and the downstream intergenic region in the genome of 'ca. l. asiaticus'. pcr analyses using a primer set flanking this genomic locus revealed eight electrophoretic types  of 'ca. l. asiaticus' strains from china and u.s. analyses on dna mosaic phenomenon depicted the inter- and intra-continent diversity of 'ca. l. asiaticus'. the molecular nature of dna mosaicism was identified through sequence analyses.

methods
sample collection
hlb symptomatic citrus leaves were collected from nine provinces in china  and florida in u.s. between  <dig> and  <dig>  each sample originated from a single tree and was tentatively considered as a single strain. all collected samples in china were shipped by mail to citrus research institute of southwest university in chongqing, or citrus hlb research laboratory of south china agricultural university in guangdong. collection of hlb samples in florida have been described previously  <cit> .

1har high altitude region; lar low altitude region

dna extraction
in chongqing, midribs of citrus leaves were excised and dna was extracted using the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide  methods as previously described  <cit> . procedures of dna extraction in guangdong and florida were described previously  <cit> . 'ca. l. asiaticus' was identified by pcr with primer sets oi1/oi2c  <cit>  and itsaf/itsar  <cit> . dna preparations were sent to the san joaquin valley agricultural sciences center, united stated department of agriculture-agricultural research services, parlier, ca, u. s. a. for further analyses.

primers and pcr assays
the whole genome sequence of 'ca. l. asiaticus' strain psy <dig>  was obtained from ncbi genbank database. fifteen primer sets, which targeted genomic loci with tandem repeats and prophage genes, were designed by setting the tm at 60°c and amplicon size around  <dig> bp with primer  <dig> software  <cit> . tandem repeat loci were identified using tandem repeat finder  with default parameters  <cit> . of the  <dig> tandem repeat loci, eight loci with 97-100% matches of each repeat were applied in the study. seven prophage loci were directly selected from the annotated 'ca. l. asiaticus' psy <dig> strain genome. dna from a set of  <dig> 'ca. l. asiaticus' strains  was used to test the capacity of each primer set in detecting strain diversity. primer set lap5640f/lap5650r flanking the chromosomal region of clibasia_ <dig> to clibasia_ <dig> was selected for further analysis because it generated different electrophoretic profiles from different strains. primer specificity to 'ca. l. asiaticus' were verified by in silico analysis through blastn search against the genbank database. primer set lapgp-1f/lapgp-1r, targeting a tandem repeat locus of clibasia_ <dig>  <cit> , was also included in this study for a comparison purpose. all primer sets used in the study are listed in table  <dig> and additional file  <dig> 

pcr amplifications were carried out in 25-μl volumes that include  <dig> μl of template dna,  <dig>  μl of each  <dig> μm forward and reverse primer,  <dig>  μl of  <dig>  mm deoxynucleoside triphosphate, and  <dig>  μl of ex taq dna polymerase at  <dig> u/μl . thermal cycling comprised an initial denaturing of 96°c for  <dig> min, followed by  <dig> cycles of amplification  and a final extension for  <dig> min. pcr products were electrophoresed in a  <dig> % agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining under uv light.

analyses of different 'ca. l. asiaticus' populations
although a single amplicon of  <dig> bp from primer set lap5640f/lap5650r was predicted based on the available genome sequence of strain psy <dig>  <cit> , multiple amplicons were observed from other 'ca. l. asiaticus' strains from china and florida. amplicon profiles on agarose gel were designated as electrophoretic types or e-types. e-type frequencies were summarized and chi-square test was used to determine the significance of e-type differences at different geographical locations.

dna sequencing and analysis
dna bands were excised from the gel and purified using qiaquick gel extraction kit . purified dnas were cloned with pgem t-easy vector  and sequenced using bigdye terminator v <dig>  cycle sequencing kit in a  <dig> ×  <dig> genetic analyzer . multiple sequence alignments were performed using clustalw  program with the default parameters  <cit> . manual adjustment was performed when appropriate. protein secondary structure prediction was performed by the method of bryson et al.  <cit>  available in psipred server http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/. the protein 3-d structure model was built based on a fold prediction protocol with the help of phyre  <cit> .

nucleotide sequence accession numbers
nine dna sequences of 'ca. l. asiaticus' representing different amplicon sizes and collection origins have been deposited in genbank with accession numbers jf <dig> to jf <dig> .

RESULTS
detection of dna mosaicisms by primer set lap5640f/lap5650r
a total of  <dig> hlb samples detected positive with primer set oi1/oi2c  <cit>  and itsaf/itsar  <cit>  were analyzed. among them,  <dig> samples were from nine provinces in china and  <dig> samples were from florida . the geographical origins of hlb samples in china were from locations of both high altitude region  and low altitude region  . pcr amplification with primer set lap5640f/lap5650r produced eight e-types, designated as e-type a to h. each e-type was composed of one or more of five dna amplicons, designated as p <dig> to p <dig> . dna polymorphisms were not detected with the other  <dig> primer sets listed in additional file  <dig> , i.e. each of the  <dig> primer sets generated a single amplicon.

the  <dig> bp calculated amplicon in the genome of 'ca. l. asiaticus' strain psy <dig> placed the strain to e-type c . surprisingly, e-type c was found in  <dig> out of the  <dig> florida hlb samples . other e-types detected in florida were a, g, and h. e-type g was predominant  followed by e-type a  and e-type h  . six e-types  were found in the  <dig> samples from china . e-type a was the most frequent , followed by e-type b . when geographical origins were considered, e-type a was mostly from lar locations and e-type b was mostly from har locations. similarly, only  <dig> samples  from china belonged to e-type c  and they were all from har locations .

to avoid the presence of small expected values in the chi-square test, data in table  <dig> were regrouped into four categories: e-type a, e-type b, e-type g and other e-types for location comparisons. the results showed that the e-type distribution of 'ca. l. asiaticus' population in china were significantly different from those in florida . within the samples from china, the e-type distribution in the lar population was significantly different from those in the har population .

correlation between e-types and trn genotypes
to evaluate the correlation between e-types and trn genotypes, all  <dig> 'ca. l. asiaticus' strains from florida  were also tested for trns variations with primer set lapgp-1f/lapgp-1r  <cit> . all the seven e-type a strains belonged to trn >  <dig> genotype, whereas the other three e-type strains were grouped with trn <  <dig> genotype. therefore, the florida strains could be divided into e-type a and non-e-type a groups, matching with trn >  <dig> and trn <  <dig> genotypes, respectively, and supported the previous observation that there were at least two groups of 'ca. l. asiaticus' strains in florida. no significant correlation between e-type and trn genotype was found after testing all 'ca. l. asiaticus' strains from yunnan, guangxi, and guangdong provinces .

sequence analyses of five amplicons from primer set lap5640f/lap5650r
the sequences of five amplicons  from primer set lap5640f/lap5650r were determined to be  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> bp, respectively . the size of each amplicon was confirmed by sequencing three to five addition 'ca. l. asiaticus' strains. alignment data showed that the five dna sequences shared a common backbone of p <dig> with p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> derived from insertion events at nucleotide position  <dig> and  <dig> . p <dig>  had a 72-bp direct repeat at position  <dig> inside open reading frame  clibasia_ <dig>  p <dig>  had an insertion of  <dig> bp fragment at position  <dig> within the annotated intergenic region. similar to p <dig>  p <dig>  had an insertion at position  <dig> but a fragment size of  <dig> bp. p <dig> had both the p <dig> and p <dig> type insertions. blastn search using the five amplicon sequences  showed that only p <dig> and p <dig> were nearly identical with bacterial sequences currently deposited in genbank database. the p <dig> sequence was identical to that in strain psy <dig>  <cit> . p <dig> was over 99% similar to those of 'ca. l. asiaticus' strain uf <dig> , liberibacter phage sc <dig> , and liberibacter phage sc <dig>   <cit> . the insertion/deletion sequences made p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> unique as comparing to the available 'ca. l. asiaticus' sequences in genbank.

in silico analyses of clibasia_ <dig> alleles
orf clibasia_ <dig> was annotated as interrupted gp <dig>  a phage-associated protein  <cit> . a 72-bp  insertion as shown in p <dig> and p <dig>  which distributed in e-type f, g, or h , created an in frame mutation. close examination showed that clibasia_ <dig> was mostly composed of imperfect six amino acids  tandem repeats leading by residue v . such hexapeptide domains are common to many bacterial transferases represented by lpxa-like enzymes. the secondary and tertiary  structure predictions on translated amino acid sequences were constructed . the  <dig> amino acid insertion apparently shortened many of the beta-sheets  and added a structure motif  along with the increases of prediction stability in both secondary and tertiary structures. interestingly, of the  <dig> strains which have p <dig> and p <dig> amplicons,  <dig>  were collected from florida, u.s., and only  <dig>  were from guangdong, china .

discussion
in this study, primer set lap5640f/lap5650r yielded one to three amplicons for a given hlb samples. a total of five amplicons with different sizes were identified. they are related by insertion/deletion events, demonstrating the mosaicism in the population genome of 'ca. l. asiaticus'. in another word, at the locus of clibasia_05640-clibasia_ <dig>  'ca. l. asiaticus' possesses alleles composed of sequences identical in some parts but polymorphic in other parts. dna mosaicism described in this study is largely from size variation of different pcr amplicons and confirmed by sequencing with limited strains. deng et al.  <cit>  showed the co-amplification of different amplicons from primer sets targeting the rrn locus in the chromosome of 'ca. l. asiaticus'. however, further sequencing investigation was not reported.

as shown in figure  <dig>  the mosaicism of e-types b, d, e, g and h is represented by multiple dna bands from the same pcr primer set, raising a question if a hlb sample has single or multiple clones  of 'ca. l. asiaticus'. this is of particular interest, since 'ca. l. asiaticus' dna obtained was not from a clonal pure culture. further complicated the issue is the variation of amplicon intensity, suggesting different concentration of pcr templates. if a single clone scenario is considered, the bacterium should have multiple lap5640f/lap5650r loci, either in chromosome or/and in the form of a phage. lytic phage possessing this genomic locus has recently been reported  <cit> . alternatively, the hlb samples may contain multiple clones of 'ca. l. asiaticus'. more evidence is, however, needed. a third scenario could be the combination of both of the above.

since the sequenced florida strain psy <dig> belongs to e-type c , it is interesting that the frequency of e-type c is low in florida , as well as in china . this could mean strain psy <dig> may not be the most representative strain. we noted that psy <dig> originated from a psyllid and all the 'ca. l. asiaticus' samples in this study were from citrus. could it be possible that bacterial population was difference between psyllids and plant hosts? zhang et al.  <cit>  recently reported that phages behaved differently between plants and psyllids in florida. phage sc <dig> and sc <dig> were lytic in dodder plant but remained lysogenic in psyllids.

among the six e-types in china, five were found in yunnan and two were in guangdong . the higher e-types number suggests that 'ca. l. asiaticus' population in yunnan could be more diverse than that in guangdong. the uniqueness of p <dig>  to yunnan samples further substantiates the speculation. it should be noted that yunnan is one of the world origins of citrus species  <cit> . it remains to be tested if a long history of the presence of citrus species is associated with more diversity of 'ca. l. asiaticus' population. information about the population diversity of 'ca. l. asiaticus' in yunnan is currently very limited.

the challenge of in vitro culture of 'ca. l. asiaticus' has been a critical factor limiting our capacity to study the bacterial biology. dna sequencing and in silico analyses provide a different venue to collect information of unculturable bacteria. regarding to clibasia_ <dig>  the p1/p3/p <dig> alleles which encode  <dig> hexapeptides predominately occurred in 'ca. l. asiaticus' populations in china, whereas the p2/p <dig> alleles which have  <dig> hexapeptides distributed mostly in florida populations. hexapeptide variation has been reported in other bacteria  <cit> . this type of genetic heterogeneity may be associated with phenotypic variation for environment adaptation  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study described and analyzed a dna mosaic phenomenon in the unculturable 'ca. l. asiaticus' associated with citrus hlb. in addition to the previous studies on two different genomic loci  <cit> , we identified a new genomic locus that generated single to multiple amplicons from different hlb samples. analyses on the dna mosaicism revealed significant inter- and intra population variations of 'ca. l. asiaticus' from south china and florida. further investigation showed that insertion/deletion events contributed to the dna mosaicisms.
