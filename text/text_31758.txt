BACKGROUND
g protein-coupled receptors  are versatile signaling molecules that regulate a vast amount of cellular processes responding to hormones and neurotransmitters  <cit> . they are present in almost every eukaryotic organism, including fungi and plants, and they are highly diversified in mammalian genomes, representing 2-3% of the human proteome  <cit> . gpcrs transduce external signals as diverse as photons, odors, pheromones, biogenic amines, neuro-peptides, proteases, glycoprotein hormones and ions  into the cell interior. the response is operated through second messenger cascades controlled by both heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins   <cit>  or g protein-independent pathways  <cit> . gpcrs constitute one of the most important pharmaceutical targets, with 30% of marketed drugs acting through them  <cit> . mammalian gpcrs are classified in three major families or classes  from which class a is the largest and most studied  <cit> . although each gpcr plays a single role in mediating physiological response, many conserved sequential and structural features are encountered among them, mainly near the cytoplasmic part where receptors bind to the g protein  <cit> . towards the extracellular side, divergence increases  <cit>  because of the wide diversity of ligands that need to be bound.

the relatively large repertoire of class a gpcr crystal structures currently available  <cit>   shed light into the understanding of gpcrs’ molecular architecture, as well as on the events responsible for signal transmission . receptors are thought to be in equilibrium among different states, being inactive ones the most populated in absence of ligand. agonist binding alters the energetic balance towards actives states triggering activation responses. this implies changes in the conformation of a few residues that are responsible for the formation and disruption of hydrophobic and hydrogen-bond interactions between specific groups of residues. most of the highly conserved residues often belong to “micro-switches” that swap between different conformations, and constitute an extended allosteric interface between transmembrane  domains  <cit> . these micro-switches span from the extracellular part to the intracellular g-protein binding site and regulate the equilibrium between inactive and active conformations. this may trigger, eventually, global movements connecting ligand binding with intracellular signaling. r <dig>  and d <dig>  , y <dig> , y <dig>  , and w <dig>  , are some of the most studied micro-switches  <cit> .

the cwxp motif in tm <dig>  is highly conserved in non-olfactory class a gpcrs, with c <dig> , w <dig>  and p <dig>  present in 71%, 78% and 98% of sequences, respectively . p <dig>  creates a huge kink in tm <dig> helix , far bigger than a usual proline in a transmembrane helix   <cit> . because an outward movement of the cytoplasmic side of tm <dig> is known to accompany receptor activation, it was initially proposed that the pro-kinked helix could act as a mechanical hinge  <cit> . in fact, these pioneering experiments and computer simulations on rhodopsin originated one of the central paradigms in gpcr activation: the so-called “rotamer toggle switch”. this consisted in a concerted change of c <dig> , w <dig>  and f <dig>  side-chain rotamers between inactive and active states, which were thought to originate the opening of tm <dig>  <cit> . in specific, transition of w <dig>  from gauche+ to trans and of c <dig>  from trans to gauche+ was proposed by shi and collaborators  <cit> . the low resolution structure of metarhodopsin i, determined by electron crystallography  <cit> , supported the rotamer change of w <dig>  as did more recent infrared spectroscopy experiments of rhodopsin photocycle  <cit> . however, and quite-unexpectedly, none of the available pairs of inactive-active structure are consistent with these rotameric changes , questioning the rotamer toggle switch model. still, it is known from mutagenesis experiments that w <dig>  is essential for signaling of some  receptors  <cit> . on the other hand, there is no current explanation for the large conservation of c <dig>  and for the effects on activity reported by various c <dig>  mutants. in particular, c <dig> t in β2-adrenergic receptor  <cit>  and c <dig> r in thyrotropin hormone receptor  <cit> , both led to constitutive gαs activation. similarly, c <dig>  mutants in cannabinoid receptors cb <dig> and cb <dig> modified both ligand recognition and receptor activation  <cit> .

the present study reports an extensive analysis of the available gpcrs crystal structures combined with results from molecular dynamics  simulations of model peptides in a membrane mimic aimed at characterizing the role of c <dig> . our results support that c <dig>  is a key element of a conserved micro-switch within the tm6/tm <dig> interface. we show that cys side-chain possesses unique physicochemical properties and rotameric preferences  that allows formation of specific interactions not possible for other small hydrogen-bonding capable residues.

RESULTS
residue prevalence and side chain conformation of position  <dig> 
70% of class-a gpcrs have cys at position  <dig> , whereas the homologous ser and thr account, respectively, for only 10% and 4% of the sequences . accordingly, most presently available crystal structures of gpcrs contain cysteine at this position except for muscarinic receptors m2r and m3r, which feature thr, and for squid rhodopsin, which features ser . this suggests that a small residue with hydrogen-bonding capabilities is required at position  <dig> , but also a preference for cys rather than ser or thr. structural analysis shows that, among receptors containing c <dig> , the residue is in gauche + conformation  in all cases except rhodopsin . m2rinv and m3rinv feature t <dig>  in gauche-  and srhoinv has s <dig>  in trans conformation. for those receptors in which both agonist- and inverse agonist-bound structures are available  there is no change in  <dig>  rotamer conformation. thus, crystal structures do not support the rotamer change for residue  <dig>  accompanying receptors activation as hypothesized by shi et al  <cit> .

md simulations of a/c/t/sxxp model peptides
we have previously shown how specific ser and thr conformers can efficiently modulate the structure of a neighboring proline-kink by forming hydrogen bonds with the backbone carbonyl at positions i- <dig> or i- <dig>   <cit> . in the present study, we performed md simulations of model peptides containing ser, thr and cys at position i- <dig> with respect to proline, in a hydrophobic solvent . analogous peptides containing c/t/swap motifs exhibit a similar profile . the aim of these simulations was to establish whether or not cys could alter the structure of a regular proline kink and quantify the extent of the alteration compared to ser and thr  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows the change in Φ and Ψ angles and in local twists and bends for peptides with respect to the reference aaap peptide, for c/t/saap motifs with the c/t/s rotamer fixed to g+, g- or t . in terms of Φ and Ψ, it can be seen that all g- conformers induce a ~15° decrease in Φ angle profile  at position i- <dig>  and an increase  in Ψ angle profile at position i- <dig>  trans conformers of ser and thr  induce a smaller but parallel effect: ~6° decrease in the Φ angle at position i- <dig>  and ~10° increase in Ψ angle profile at i- <dig> position. regarding bend profiles, all of them exhibit a bimodal shape, where cys g+, cys t and ser g+ exhibit the smallest deviations  relative to the wt. finally, twist angle in all g- conformers exhibits a pronounced decrease in the region between i- <dig> and i. collectively, it can be concluded that cg-  and all rotamers of ser and thr  modify the standard proline kink profile . opposite, profiles of both cg+ and ct reveal no important alterations of the standard pro-kink . taking in consideration that cg- rotamer is forbidden because of steric clash  <cit>  , cysteine turns out to be the only small hydrogen-bonding capable residue that does not modify the profile of a standard pro-kink in its allowed conformations. on the other hand, ser and thr would require further adaptation of the environment in order to be tolerated at position  <dig> .

tm6/tm <dig> interactions involving  <dig> 
having discarded c <dig>  as a modulator of tm <dig> kink, it is then likely that its high conservation is due to specific interactions played by the thiol group. crystal structures show that the central segments of both tm <dig> and tm <dig> are in intimate contact. the maximum proximity is found between residues  <dig>  and  <dig>  . position  <dig>  is precisely the hinge of the rigid body movement of the cytoplasmic side of tm <dig> associated to gpcr activation  <cit> . figure 2a shows a detailed view centered at c <dig>  for β2arinv structure  taken as representative. it can be seen that the thiol group is surrounded by three aliphatic residues , one aromatic residue , but also by hydrogen bond-capable groups . this dual nature at the environment of  <dig>  is common to the remaining structures and perfectly suits the physiochemical properties of cys thiol group. analysis of proteins of known structures show that cysteine environment are closer to those of ile methyl groups than to ser  <cit> . on the other hand, cys is a moderately good hydrogen-bond donor as demonstrated by the fact that more than two thirds of the thiol groups in the protein data bank or the cambridge structural database co-occur with suitable acceptors, manly carbonyl groups  <cit> . cysteine has also been described to participate in thiol- aromatic π-type hydrogen bonds  <cit> .

based on molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis studies, a c <dig> -n <dig>  hydrogen bond interaction has recently been proposed in the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor  <cit> . since all receptors with available structures feature n <dig>   except brho/srho  and cxcr <dig>  we assessed, by conducting systematic analysis on the available crystal structures, if this interaction was likely to exist in other gpcrs.

available crystal structures differ in the assignment of co and nh <dig> groups for n <dig>  . this it is not surprising because even at  <dig>  Å resolution  it is not possible to correctly assign all side chain rotamers. since it is unlikely that the orientation of the co/nh <dig> groups of n <dig>  is not the same in all receptors  we evaluated the two possible orientations using nq-flipper   <cit> . the results revealed that the conformer present in β2arinv  is the most favorable in all structures. we, therefore, performed our analysis assuming the rotamer present in β2arinv as the correct one. table  <dig> displays s · · · o distances and cβ-s · · · o angles measured on the crystal structures of asn <dig> -containing receptors . in all structures containing c <dig>  except β2arago structure , geometries are compatible with the existence of a hydrogen bond between c <dig>  and n <dig>   <cit> . it should be noted that sulfur hydrogen bond has a strong dispersion energy component  <cit>  and, therefore, the directionality of the hydrogen bond is less pronounced than in conventional hydrogen bonds, leading to flat potential energy surfaces that are attractive even at large distances  <cit> .

figure 2b shows a comparison between β2arinv and β2arago, displaying the breakage of the c <dig>  · · · n <dig>  hydrogen bond upon agonist binding. in parallel, it can be seen in the figure that carbonyl group of  <dig>  in β2arinv is oriented toward the amide group of c <dig> , whereas in β2arago it points towards thiol c <dig>  group.

as a result, there is a decrease in the cys <dig>  · · ·  <dig>  distance, which suggests the stabilization of an alternative hydrogen bond in β2arago. this leads us to propose that the breakage of the c <dig> -n <dig>  hydrogen bond is related to activation in β2ar. for a2ar the trend of that withdrawnness of n <dig>  from c <dig>  is clearly maintained. the fact that β1arago and a2arago structures reflect a smaller change as compared to β2arago could be due to the fact that the structures do not account for fully active-like states, as it has previously been proposed  <cit> . possible reasons could be the lack of tm <dig> opening  or, in the case of β1arago, the presence of thermostabilizing mutations . on the other hand, h1rinv, known for its high basal activity, exhibits a distance in between β2arinv and β2arago even in presence of antagonist  <cit> .

muscarinic receptors are of the few gpcrs that present a thr in position  <dig> . despite that m2rinv and m3rinv exhibit the analogous hydrogen bond interaction between t <dig>  and n <dig> . the rotamer for thr is g-, despite g+ is the most populated rotamer for thr . this anomaly seems to originate from the steric clash that thr methyl group would give with tm <dig> in the latter conformer. rhodopsins belong to the small group of receptors that contain s <dig> . because serine is too short to reach the side-chain of  <dig> , rhodopsins seem to have adopted alternative mechanisms to control tm6-tm <dig> interface. this could be related with the fact that retinal is attached to the neighboring k <dig> . figure 2c displays the structure of srhoinv that, oddly, features s <dig>  in the g+ rotamer conformation. it can be seen that the receptor contains residue q <dig>  that bridges s <dig>  and s <dig> . in the case of brho , brhoinv contains an alternative tm6-tm <dig> hydrogen bond between c <dig>  and t <dig> . comparison between brhoinv and brhoago reveals that in the former, trans c <dig>  forms a hydrogen with g- t <dig> , whereas in the latter, t <dig>  has changed conformation to trans, breaking c <dig> -t <dig>  interaction . thus, as in β2arinv/β2arago pair, there is a breakage of the c <dig> -tm <dig> hydrogen bond associated to activation.

cxcr4inv is the only resolved receptor whose sequence contains h <dig>  . although histidine is 87% conserved in chemokine receptors, cxcr4inv shows no  interaction between  <dig>  and h <dig> .

 <dig>  modulates d <dig> -n <dig>  interaction
in β2arinv n <dig>  and n <dig>  side chains form a water-mediated hydrogen bond. in β2arago, release of n <dig>  from c <dig>  permits n <dig>  to free n <dig>  side-chain  from n <dig> , enabling the interaction between n <dig>  and d <dig>  . stability of d <dig>  is reinforced by conformation changes of residue s <dig>  from g+  to trans . unsurprisingly, s <dig>  is highly conserved  in class a gpcrs. thus, c <dig> -n <dig>  interaction keeps n <dig>  away from d <dig>  and disruption of this hydrogen bond favors n <dig> -d <dig>  interaction.

in brhoago, t <dig>  allows y <dig>  to interact with the backbone carbonyl of  <dig> . the displacement of y <dig>  away from n <dig>  allows the latter to interact with d <dig>  through a water molecule resolved in the crystal structure. on the other hand, interaction c <dig> -t <dig>  in brhoinv disables n <dig> -d <dig>  interaction and retains y <dig>  close to n <dig>  . unsurprisingly, y <dig>  is 80% conserved among opsins, backing the importance of this residue within this subfamily. y <dig>  could not populate the conformation found in the crystal if c <dig>  would be in the g+ rotamer. this explains that c <dig>  is found in the trans rotamer. on the other hand, srho features h <dig>  . given the smaller side chain of his compared to tyr, residue c <dig>  can populate the g+ rotamer in the former. still, q <dig>  would prevent n <dig>  from interacting with d <dig> .

together with y <dig> , n <dig>  is described to undergo a conformational change that helps the release of r <dig>  from d/e <dig>  . this permits r <dig>  to adopt an extended conformation that favors the interaction with the c-terminal portion of gα domain of g-proteins  <cit> . these conformational changes open a cavity between tms  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  allowing g-protein binding  <cit> . in the context of the global toggle switch model proposed by schwartz and collaborators  <cit> , where various non-covalent interactions form an allosteric interface that connects ligand binding with intracellular signaling, c <dig>  could be considered as an intermediate micro-switch modulating interaction between n <dig>  and n <dig> , thus ultimately modulating tm2-tm <dig> interaction via n <dig>  and d <dig> . in the cascade of events during gpcr activation, c <dig>  micro-switch would be preceding n <dig> .

the analysis of hydrogen bond networks associated to position  <dig>  reveals that receptors having c <dig>  in gauche+/- conformation rarely have hydrogen-bond capable residue at position  <dig>  . in this situation, c <dig>  forms hydrogen bond with the side chain of residue at position  <dig> . on the other hand, in those structures where residue  <dig>  is in the trans rotamer conformation, position  <dig>  contains ser . in such cases c <dig>  forms a hydrogen bond with position  <dig>  instead. even with differences at position  <dig>  in rotamer conformation  and, to a lesser extent, in residue occurrence , all crystal structures are in accordance with a hydrogen bond network that connects residue at  <dig>  with n <dig>  of the npxxy motif and the highly conserved  d <dig> , via n <dig> .

CONCLUSIONS
the largely conserved cys <dig>  of the cwxp motif of class-a gpcrs was initially thought to modulate the conformation of the tm <dig> proline-kink through a rotamer switch during the process of activation. the release of several agonist-bound  crystal structures invalidated this possibility, as no conformational change of this residue has been observed, leaving the role and the prevalence of cys <dig>  unexplained. the present analysis of crystal structures suggests that c <dig>  has an active role in rearranging the tm6/ <dig> interface between active and inactive states. inactive structures are characterized by an interaction between the side chains of residues c <dig>  and  <dig> / <dig> , and this generates a constraint in the tm6-tm <dig> interface that keeps n <dig>   away from d <dig> . because active structures do not exhibit the interaction between  <dig> / <dig>  and  <dig> , the formation of a hydrogen bond between n <dig>  and d <dig>  is enabled. we propose that high conservation of cys at this position is attributable to the requirement of a small residue with ability to form both intra- and extra- main chain hydrogen bonds without altering tm <dig> pro-kink. cys has specific rotameric preferences compared to ser or thr, and in addition, the thiol group forms less directional hydrogen bonds than the hydroxyl group.

although none of the different approaches presented in this study corroborates per se our hypothesis, their combination brings to a unique possible role for cys <dig>  in class a gpcrs: cys <dig>  is the gate keeper of the hydrogen bond network involving n <dig> , n. <dig>  and d <dig> , one of the most important micro-switches associated to gpcr activation.
