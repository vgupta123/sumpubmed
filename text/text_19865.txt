BACKGROUND
rhizobia is the collective name of the genera rhizobium, sinorhizobium and mesorhizobium, which are soil and rhizosphere bacteria of agronomic importance because they form nitrogen-fixing symbioses with leguminous plants  <cit> . thus, rhizobia are considered bio-fertilizers and have been used as inoculants for over 120 years. rhizobial genetic diversity and the plant-bacteria molecular interactions have been well-studied  <cit> . the growth rate of mesorhizobium is intermediate between the genera rhizobium and bradyrhizobium and is one of the largest genera. additionally, the mesorhizobium genera consists of  <dig> species found in asia, europe, the mediterranean region and africa  <cit> .

jarvins et al.  <cit>  were the first to request the creation of the mesorhizobium genus and reclassified several genera identified as rhizobium into mesorhizobium. the correct phylogenetic identification of a species requires an accurate technical characterization  <cit> .

the taxonomy of mesorhizobium requires the reclassification of species because there is a need for studies to avoid classification problems. taxonomic information provides access to basic trait information such as physiology, epidemiology and evolutionary history  <cit> . the correct taxonomic assignment of bacterial genomes is a primary and challenging task .

the partial 16s ribosomal rna gene  is a molecular marker widely used in the taxonomy of bacteria. however, this gene has no consensus sequence to correctly classify microorganisms at the species level . thus, dna-dna hybridization  has been used as the gold standard for defining prokaryotic species at the genomic level. ddh is the only taxonomic method that offers a numerical and relatively stable species. therefore, ddh influences how the current classification system has been constructed  <cit> .

ddh is an expensive and laborious method that is available in only a few laboratories worldwide, since it requires the hybridization of hundreds of strains and often does not resolve the taxonomic problems. however, it is an important limiting factor for the description of new species, particularly in countries with the greatest biodiversity. prokaryotic species continue to be a group of strains due to dna-dna re-association values greater than 70 %  <cit> .

the recent development of sequencing technologies has enabled us to carefully assess microbial communities by generating many nucleotide sequences at lower costs. next generation sequencing  technologies have revolutionized the field of microbial ecology and allows researchers to determine the level of diversity more closely using in-depth sequencing. there are various applications using these ngs platforms, which range from single-gene targeted sequencing to whole-genome sequencing and shotgun metagenome sequencing  <cit> . with the availability of whole genome sequences, the gene content based approaches appear promising in inferring the bacterial taxonomy. the complete genome sequencing of a bacterial genome often reveals a substantial number of unique genes present only in that genome which can be used for its taxonomic classification  <cit> .

the recent improved access to various new gene sequences and the definition of prokaryote species has led to doubts regarding the suitability of the dna-dna hybridization method  <cit> . the new proposals include the analysis of several genes or the entire genome. one proposed analysis method is to analyze common genes between two strains and determine the average nucleotide identity values . an ani value exceeding 94 % corresponds to 70 % traditional dna-dna hybridization  <cit> .

this analysis method also considers genes with ecological functions. other ani values suggested replacing 70 % hybridization with 95 % ani and 69 % conserved dna. in the protein coding portion of the genome, these values would suggest 85 % conserved genes  <cit> . the most recent proposals recommend > 95–96 % ani to delineate species and would replace the traditional 70 % cut off threshold used for ddh sequences  <cit> .

the aim of this study was to evaluate semia <dig> isolated in mexico as b-11a mex and is classified by phenotypic taxonomic methods such as rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viceae by different groups of researchers. we used a combination of complete 16s rrna sequencing and complete genome analysis to reclassify b-11a as mesorhizobium sp.

RESULTS
bacterial growth curve
the bacterial growth curve of semia <dig> is shown in fig.  <dig>  semia <dig> grew similar to the median strains of rhizobium, mesorhizobium and bradyrhizobium. these findings phenotypically characterize semia <dig> as part of the genus mesorhizobium. this strain was originally isolated in mexico  and classified taxonomically as rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viceae semia <dig> by a combination of phenotypic methods, biochemical tests and partial sequencing of the 16s rrna gene.fig.  <dig> bacterial growth curve. bradyrhizobium elkanii lmg <dig>  rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viceae lmg <dig>  mesorhizobium huakuii lmg <dig> and mesorhizobium sp. semia <dig> strains




genome assembly of semia <dig> and its features
the sequencing result shows that strain semia <dig> has the following characteristics: one contig of  <dig> ,002 bp, g + c content 63 %,  <dig>  coding sequences  and a total of  <dig> rnas. in the semia <dig> genome, there are two clusters encoding nitrite reductase  and four clusters related to denitrification processes that reduce nitrate to nitrogen gas. it is postulated that after host infection this cluster is responsible for allowing brucella suis to survive low oxygen concentrations because the cells can use nitrogen oxides as final electron acceptors  <cit> . the presence of this pathway enables semia <dig> to use this mechanism of intracellular survival during host infection.

we also found the following other genes were present in the genome of semia3007: nifa, nifs, nifu, isca-like, nifb, frdn, nifx, nifx <dig>  nife, nifn, nifq, nifw, nifh, nifd, nifk, nifz and nift. these results suggest mechanisms for denitrification processes. the nif genes function in the transformation of ammonia nitrogen, nitrate, and nitrite ammonification and code for proteins such as nitrate reductase , nitrite reductase  , ferredoxin-nitrite reductase  and nitrite reductase  .

the semia <dig> genome also contains a subsystem for assimilation of ammonia and the bacteria can use ammonia assimilated for metabolism of amino acids . the system uses glutamate ammonia ligase , glutamate synthase  , glutamate synthase   and glutamate synthase  .

system secretions of type i, type ii, type iv and type vi were identified. these system components are common among rhizobia. the type iv secretion systems are identified in microorganisms associated with plants and are usually composed of vir proteins  <cit> . the operon of the type iv semia <dig> system features  <dig> genes encoding the following proteins: virb1-virb <dig>  virb <dig>  virb8-virb <dig>  virb <dig>  vird <dig> and virg. the virb region is responsible for coding key virulence factors in the symbiosis species mesorhizobium  <cit> . this operon may assist in inducing acidification of the phagosome in the cells after phagocytosis. the acidification may lead to the segregation of unknown effector molecules and create changes in the host cell endosome that generate a new intracellular compartment in which the attacker can replicate  <cit> . the secretion systems of types iii, iv and vi and the nodulation factors are considered responsible for lead host specificity in mesorhizobium huakuii  <cit> .

genome comparisons of semia <dig> and rhizobium
our analysis of the similarity between genomes can be used to differentiate microorganisms. we used the genomes of semia <dig>  rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viceae , rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii , mesorhizobium erdmanii , mesorhizobium ciceri , mesorhizobium huakuii , mesorhizobium loti  and mesorhizobium opportunistum  to construct a progressive alignment using the program mauve. we found there was a high degree of similarity  between semia <dig> and the mesorhizobium group and a limited number of blocks collinear between rhizobium .fig.  <dig> genomes comparison between mesorhizobium and rhizobium. a a genome alignment of eight genomes using mauve reveals collinear blocks conserved  among all genomes. each chromosome is shown horizontally and homologous blocks in each genome are shown as identically colored regions. b similarity between genomes aligned by mauve program showing the phylogenetic relationships between genomes




ani  <cit>  is one method that has replaced the ddh  <cit> , and it is the best in silico parameter representing ddh that has been experimentally demonstrated  <cit> . our genome comparisons for taxonomic purposes were based on blast calculations  <cit> . an ani value of 95 % ±  <dig>  % identity corresponds to 70 % ddh  <cit> , which is a value often recommended to delimit species when used in conjunction with other criteria, such as phenotypic traits  <cit> .

richter and rossello-mora  <cit>  describe a software tool  designed to easily allow the calculation of ani based on the blast algorithm  <cit>  and the mummer ultra-rapid aligning tool  <cit> . we also calculated the tetranucleotide frequencies, which are alignment-free parameters that have been successfully applied to phylogenetically sort metagenome inserts  <cit> . therefore, the 95–96 % ani threshold can be readily used as an objective boundary for species circumscription if it is reinforced by high tetra correlation values  <cit> . our results demonstrate that semia <dig> is more genetically similar to mesorhizobium huakuii than rhizobium .table  <dig> probability of pairwise comparison

phylogenetic analysis using 16s rrna
the results of sequencing the 16s rrna gene semia <dig> were subjected to a membership analysis taxonomy in rdpii bank. we utilized the classifier tool with a threshold of 95 %. the result showed the identity was 100 % mesorhizobium. additionally, there was 100 % identity with the 16s ribosomal rna database using the blast program .

a phylogenetic analysis was performed using data available on the ncbi database to assess whether semia <dig> should be identified and cataloged as rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viceae within rhizobium or be reclassified as part of the mesorhizobium group .

the results of the phylogenetic analysis clearly show semia <dig> is a member of mesorhizobium and is separate from the rhizobium group, which suggests a reclassification of semia <dig> is warranted .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree showing the taxonomic position of semia <dig> strain between groups of mesorhizobium and rhizobium. genetic differences between bacteria of  <dig>  %. the numbers in the branches show the probability calculated by mrbayes with the colors




comparison of gene orthologs
previous studies have compared genes to differentiate organisms. we used orthomcl clustering to identify “core genes”, which are the number of unique and shared orthologs of semia <dig> and mesorhizobium . a total of  <dig>  proteins from semia <dig> , m. huakuii , m. erdmanii , m. loti  and m. opportunistum  were evaluated. we used an inflation index of  <dig>  to complete genes and identified  <dig>  ortholog groups within the five genomes.fig.  <dig> venn diagram showing core genome analyses of mesorhizobium strains. the number of protein-coding gene ortholog sharing among five mesorhizobium. semia3007; m. huakuii ; m. loti ; m. opportunistum ; m. erdmanii 




the clusters of orthologs in fig.  <dig> show there are  <dig>  ortholog groups in semia <dig> representing  <dig>  % of the total cds in the genome. however, semia <dig> and m. huakuii showed  <dig>   common ortholog groups. we found that semia <dig> and m. erdmanii shared  <dig>   orthologs. there were  <dig>   orthologs in common between semia <dig> and m. loti. there were also  <dig>   orthologs shared between semia <dig> and m. opportunistum. therefore, isolated semia <dig> shows a large number of mesorhizobium gene orthologs. these findings suggest that semia <dig> is a mesorhizobium strain.


therefore, the results for growth curve of semia <dig>  comparative analysis of the genome, ani, gene orthologs and phylogenetic analysis using 16s rrna show that semia <dig> is not rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viceae suggesting its reclassification for mesorhizobium group .

CONCLUSIONS
ngs technologies have proven their utility in genomic and metagenomics areas since their earliest application appeared in  <dig>  identifying each individual sequence is important in microbial community analysis because the taxonomic information provides access to basic trait information such as physiology, epidemiology and evolutionary history. the taxonomic information also permits indirect inference of their ecological roles in a given environment  <cit> .

whole-genome sequencing has proven to be valuable and critical for refining the phylogenetic positions and correct taxonomic classification of rhizobial strains  <cit> . in this study, we sequenced, assembled and annotated the semia <dig> genome. we used this genome sequence to examine the phylogenetic relationship between mesorhizobium and rhizobium genus. semia <dig> was classified by phenotypic taxonomic methods and biochemical tests as rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viceae. however, our results strongly suggest that semia <dig> belongs to the mesorhizobium genus. the placement of semia <dig> in a mesorhizobium genus is supported by our analysis of ani, ortholog genes and phylogenetic analysis.

we can see a high degree of similarity and block synteny and direction between semia <dig> and the mesorhizobium group. our results demonstrated there were a limited number of blocks collinear between rhizobium. additionally, the ani based on a pairwise genome comparison of all shared ortholog protein coding genes is 98 % with mesorhizobium huakuii. our phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that semia <dig> is not part of the rhizobium genus, and the ortholog genes revealed sufficient ability to identify semia <dig> as mesorhizobium.

the concepts of orthology originated from the field of molecular systematics  <cit>  and have recently been applied to functional characterizations and classifications on the scale of whole-genome comparisons . in comparative genomics, the clustering of orthologous genes provides a framework for integrating information from multiple genomes by highlighting the divergence and conservation of gene families and biological processes.

the identification of orthologous groups in prokaryotic genomes has permitted cross-referencing of genes from multiple species and has facilitated genome annotation, protein family classification, studies on bacterial evolution and the identification of strains. the ultimate goal of taxonomy is to construct a classification that is operative and predictive for any discipline in microbiology. the classification is also essentially stable for old and new strain such as rhizobia and the collective names of the genera rhizobium, sinorhizobium, mesorhizobium.
