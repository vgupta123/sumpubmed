BACKGROUND
clinical context
worldwide, wounds pose a major health issue. lower extremity ulcers alone cost the us medicare system $ <dig>  billion. unless wound therapies see a large improvement, we will see escalating treatment costs and morbidity as the population ages and as the incidence of diabetes and obesity increases. an understanding of the mechanisms underlying wound healing will shed light on how normal physiology adapts to changes in the normal homeostatic environment. the vacuum assisted closure  device  is a relatively new modality in wound healing. although the device has been shown to accelerate wound healing, its mode of action remains to be proven convincingly. figure  <dig> shows the application of the device. this involves packing a polyurethane sponge into the wound bed and then sealing the wound including the sponge with an occlusive dressing that has one outlet tube going to a vacuum . theories about how this device obtains its efficacy range from a reduction in bacterial load  <cit>  to a reduction in edema. the blowup in figure  <dig> shows that with the application of the vacuum the skin is pulled into the intra-strut spacings of the sponge thereby stretching the skin.

in an earlier publication, we have used a numerical model to show how the imposition of the vacuum forces the tissue to stretch by small amounts  as the tissue is 'pulled' into the empty space defined by regular holes in the sponge causing a tension to be applied to the tissue substrate and through it to the cells embedded within the substrate  <cit> . previous work  <cit>  by donald ingber, one of the co-authors on our microstreatch paper  <cit>  has shown that cells stretched in vitro proliferate, whereas cells that are not stretched are cell cycle arrested. we thus, in that paper, hypothesized that through a similar mechanism the cells in the wound bed subjected to stretch by the application of negative suction pressure are also proliferating and thus helping the wound heal faster  <cit> . if we are able to understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie tissue response to forces, then we could substitute forces with interventions that mimic these molecular events. the effects of tissue expansion mechanisms  <cit>  are little studied in the literature. a rat ear was chosen as the system in which to study the effects of forces on tissues in a perfused system . the rat ear is thin and the blood vessels can be easily visualized under a light microscope. further, it is highly amenable to force experiments in vivo.

RESULTS
enrichment analyses
we ran the absolute enrichment, the upregulated enrichment , and the downregulated enrichment analyses on our dataset as explained in the methods section. the results are presented in tables  <dig> through  <dig> respectively. the absolute enrichment analysis produced the hypoxia gene set as the top ranked gene set of the  <dig> gene sets tested. also, 'response to mechanical stimulus' achieves the second highest rank. the members of the hypoxia gene set are listed in table  <dig> along with their paired t scores. positive t scores  indicate overall upregulation over the  <dig> time points, while negative scores  indicate overall downregulation over the  <dig> time points.

it should be noted that in gene set enrichment analysis we typically do not calculate the p values for each gene separately. rather we perform the permutation test  and look for the p values of the gene set. this is why we have not listed the p values of the genes in the hypoxia pathway. in the upregulated enrichment analysis, 'response to mechanical stimulus' achieves the top position. interestingly, the c <dig> cluster which is enriched for reproduction genes from ease and which was derived from mootha's original gene sets has obtained second rank in the up regulated analysis. there are a total of  <dig> c clusters derived by mootha through the use of self organizing maps over the gnf mouse expression atlas which itself is derived from expression profiling of different mouse tissue  <cit> . there were no gene sets in the down regulated analysis that had an ambiguous interpretation and thus none had to be analyzed through ease. the hypoxia gene set obtains rank  <dig> in the down regulated enrichment analysis. to see how members of the hypoxia gene set may be co-regulated, we ran a co-expression network analysis.

co-expression network analysis
pairwise correlations between the gene expression trajectories provide the correlation network weights shown in table  <dig>  the correlation network structure based on a threshold of  <dig>  is shown in figure  <dig>  to obtain the connectivity values , absolute values of the correlations were summed for each gene.

expression ratio plot over time
the hypoxia gene set members were further visualized by plotting the stretch to control expression values in three groups. the first group was made up of the positively upregulated members of the hypoxia pathway . the second and third groups were obtained by taking the remaining members of the hypoxia pathway  and then splitting them by inspection of their time trajectories into two groups. these results are presented in figures  <dig> through  <dig> 

the time trajectories of the members of the hypoxia gene set show two prototypical behaviors. they show either a sharp spike at earlier time points that is then dampened or they show a sharp dip at earlier time points that then recovers at later time points. these two are displayed on the co-expression network graph . we note that the members shown in light green shading show the first prototypical behavior while members negatively correlated with this set show the dip behavior . ep300_1373916_at and rgd_1561628_predicted are negatively correlated with casp <dig> and thus show a rise at earlier time points but we haven't shaded these because their rise isn't as pronounced.

discussion
the response to mechanical stimulus' gene set was ranked at number two in our absolute enrichment analysis and it was ranked at number one in our upregulated enrichment analysis. this gives us a strong measure of confidence that our t paired statistic is capturing relevant themes in our rat ear stretch system.

in the absolute enrichment framework, permutation testing  <cit>  gave the hypoxia gene set a highly significant p value of  <dig>  at the  <dig>  level. the two prototypical behaviors seen in the time trajectories  tell us that the genes in our hypoxia pathway show either a sharp rise or a sharp fall at earlier time points and then recover. this behavior was then compared with what has been reported in the literature. specifically, we note that sod <dig> shows a decline at earlier time points and then a recovery while nos <dig>  slc2a <dig>  and hmox <dig> all show sharp rises at earlier time points. maiti et al  <cit>  have stated that "under hypoxic stress, the cellular defence systems such as antioxidant enzymes  get disturbed and their activity decreases." further, they report that in the rat brain, hypoxia leads to an increase in nitric oxide. in our system, nos <dig> is sharply rising at earlier time points while sod <dig> is falling at earlier time points.

it has also been reported in the literature that no production upregulates heme oxygenase  production  <cit> . this may explain why we see a sharp rise in hmox in the early time points. it also may explain why on our co-expression network graph, nos <dig> and hmox show a positive correlation of  <dig> . at later time points, however, nos <dig> and hmox- <dig> do not move together . nitric oxide isn't the only mediator of hmox- <dig> upregulation. for example, it has been reported that hmox- <dig> is the major stress protein induced by uva, hydrogen peroxide and arsenite  <cit> . further, it is known that hmox- <dig> expression is linked to tissue stretch. many pathways lead to heme oxygenase i expression through renal injury  <cit> . mechanical stress has been shown to cause oxidant stress  <cit>  and hmox- <dig> levels are increased when cells are exposed to oxidative stress  <cit> . hmox- <dig> prevents oxidant-induced microvascular leukocyte adhesion  <cit> . hmox- <dig> has cytoprotective roles  <cit> , and is anti-inflammatory  <cit> .

hmox- <dig> itself is a negative regulator of no  <cit> . thus, if hmox- <dig> is upregulated independently of no , then no is strongly inhibited. for example, hemin can upregulate hmox- <dig> . this induction has been shown to strongly inhibit no production of lps-activated macrophages  <cit> . loike et al. <cit>  have reported that hypoxia leads to glucose transporter expression in endothelial cells. thus, it may be that we see a sharp spike in slc2a <dig>  as a consequence of hypoxia at earlier time points in our system.

thus, our system may be increasing glucose intake to make up for lack of oxygen, and it seems that our system may be undergoing hypoxia  <cit>  at least at earlier time points. according to  <cit> , "...the molecular mechanisms by which muscle contraction/hypoxia increase glucose uptake are less well defined, although they appear to be independent of the pi3k pathway. most intriguing is the observation that the recently identified hormone adiponectin also stimulates skeletal muscle glucose uptake in a pi3k-independent manner." the adiponectin gene is not part of the hypoxia gene set. we went to our dataset to see if seemed to show a trend similar to the genes in our hypoxia pathway. the adiponectin gene showed an upregulation or a rise at earlier time points dropping to a downregulation at later time points .

to our knowledge this is the first evidence that tissue stretch may lead to hypoxia. however, we should stress that we do not have replicates at each time point. thus, the conclusions on the time trajectories follow from the results of the enrichment analysis and not the other way round. because we feel that the hypoxia pathway is important, we then study its time trajectory in more detail for further insights.

CONCLUSIONS
our results show that the hypoxia pathway is clearly the most important in this dataset. this finding gives us insights not only into the biology that underlies the tissue response to forces, but also into clinical interventions that could be designed to mimic within wounded tissue the effects of forces without all the negative effects that forces themselves create . mimicking the effects of forces through the excitation of important parts of our hypoxia pathway through the use of interference rna or other gene therapy interventions could make an important impact on the suffering that delayed wound healing creates in various disorders, primary among them being diabetes.
