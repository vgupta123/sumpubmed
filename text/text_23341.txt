BACKGROUND
micrornas  play crucial regulatory roles in repressing mrna translation or mediating mrna degradation by targeting mrnas in a sequence-specific manner  <cit> . mirna-mediated regulation has been found to encompass a wide spectrum of biological processes ranging from growth and development to oncogenesis  <cit> . in general, one mirna can target more than one gene , and one gene can be controlled by more than one mirna   <cit> . cooperative binding of one or several distinct mirnas to a single target gene has been shown to be important for the functionality of mirna-mediated gene regulation  <cit> . for example, genetic evidences in previous research suggest that the lin- <dig> gene is cooperatively regulated by the lin- <dig> mirna and another unidentified mirna  <cit> . krek et al.  <cit>  also presented that mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and let-7b jointly regulate mtpn, providing evidence to support coordinate control of mirnas in mammals. studying the cooperativity of mirnas is a substantial step for understanding the contribution of co-regulating mirnas towards a complex interplay between mirnas.

recently several studies have attempted to develop methods to understand mirna cooperativity. boross et al. computed the correlations between the gene silencing scores of individual mirnas  <cit> . xu et al. also developed a computational method to identify significant synergistic mirna pairs via functional co-regulating mirnas that they jointly regulate  <cit> . most of these studies however did not actually considered co-expression profiles of mrnas and mirnas. considering that most mirnas exert their functions through interactions with other mirnas, an understanding of a mirna network context using both co-expression pattern and the sequence complementarity between mirnas and mrnas is essential to discover the cooperative regulation of mirnas.

in this paper, we propose a computational method to construct a mirna association network  by integrating multiple genomic data sources including mirna-mrna binding information and mirna-mrna co-expression profiles. while sequence complementarity-based mirna-mrna target relationships serve as a static set, dynamic expression profiles of mirnas and mrnas are used to identify those subsets that are concurrently active. we evaluate the mirnas modules determined to be significantly cooperative by assessing the functional coherence of target genes co-regulated by the mirna modules. then, we apply graph theoretical methods to characterize mran and analyse whether mirnas belonging to the network are associated with each other in a condition-dependent manner or not. finally we report that co-regulating mirnas tend to have structural similarities.

RESULTS
construction and characterization of mirna association networks
molecular complex detection algorithm   <cit>  revealed  <dig> cooperative mirna modules  . the numbers of mirnas and connections of the cmms range from  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig>  respectively . cmm  <dig> and  <dig> consist of let- <dig> family members and mir-103/ <dig> family, respectively. table  <dig> exhibits mirna family members included in cmms and figure  <dig> shows their condition-specific cooperativity. the first known human mirna let- <dig> and its family members are highly conserved across species in sequence and function. misregulation of let- <dig> leads to a less differentiated cellular state and the development of cell-based diseases such as cancer. the role of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> in regulation of cdk5r <dig> expression and in cellular migration and neural development is well documented  <cit> .

transcription factors are thought to regulate the transcription of mirnas in a pol ii dependent manner similar to that of protein-coding genes; that is, by binding to conventional transcription factor binding site sequences  located in or near promoter regions that lie upstream of the mirnas  <cit> . we examined the promoter regions of mirnas for the presence of regulatory motifs. we determined over-represented motifs and found  <dig> significantly over-represented tfbs pairs  among the  <dig> pairs  using hypergeometric distribution  ).

mutually exclusive functional landscape of mirna cooperativity
the biology of mirna function will be dictated by the mrna transcripts targeted by specific mirnas  <cit> . functional enrichment analysis of mirna's target transcripts hence can be used as a proxy for evaluation of the functional coherence of cmms. we performed functional enrichment analysis by using all kegg and biocarta pathways for each cmm. heat maps in figure  <dig> and  <dig> exhibit-log <dig> p-values obtained by hypergeometric tests between  cmms' target transcripts and  kegg and biocarta pathways. all pathways mapped to at least one cmm and all modules mapped to at least one pathway appear in the heat maps. those modules and pathways that have no mapping at all are omitted from each heat map. ten  and nine  cmms have at least one kegg and biocarta pathway mappings, respectively.

cmm  <dig> has many significantly enriched pathways both in kegg and biocarta and other cmms show small numbers of differently enriched pathways. one noteworthy pattern in both heat maps is the finding that functionally enriched pathways  show little overlap between cmms . it seems evident from the heat maps that cmms extracted by mining the global mran exhibit functional landscape of mutually exclusive cmms.

properties of the condition-dependent mirna association network
one mirna may be involved in many cmms in a condition-specific and combinatorial manner. figure  <dig> illustrates cmms  <dig> to  <dig> from table  <dig>  expression profiles of mir- <dig> and mir-106a show very high correlation coefficient  as well as high target overlap score  both in prostate cancer and circadian rhythm. so do the expression profiles of mir- <dig> and mir-17-5p in circadian rhythm. it seems that the function of a mirna in the context of cooperativity can better be defined by its interactions with other mirnas  rather than by its individual characteristics. microarray analysis by volinia et al. for determining mirna signatures in prostate cancer includes both mir- <dig> and mir-106a, which have well-characterized cancer associations  <cit> . several lines of evidences suggest that mir- <dig> may have different partners in different conditions. mir- <dig> and mir-130b affect the proliferation and survival of htlv-1-infected/transformed cells  <cit> . mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> are expressed at higher levels in small-cell than in non-small-cell lung cancer cell lines and immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells   <cit> . mirnas- <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 29a were significantly over-expressed in the serum from ovarian cancer patients compared to controls  <cit> .

the three mirna families in cmm  <dig> are in fact regarded as a larger family of mir-15/ <dig> group. these mirnas are involved in cell division, metabolism, stress response, and angiogenesis in vertebrate species and have been implicated in human cancers, cardiovascular disease and neurodegenerative disease, including alzheimer's disease  <cit> . membership in this group is defined based on sequence similarity near the mature mirnas' 5' end: all include the sequence agcagc. while all vertebrates studied to date express mir-15a, mir-15b, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig>  mammals alone are known to express mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig> 

sequence and structural similarities within mirna association network
recognition of only  <dig> ~  <dig> nt base pair in the seed sequence of the mirna are enough to induce functional inhibition of the target gene  <cit> . although critical points for target recognition are the short sites that match the seed region of the mirna, the possible role of the secondary structure of mirna cannot be overlooked in post-transcriptional regulation of mirna expression. if we assume that the distributions of the similarities obtained within cmms, between cmms, and among random mirnas is a normal distribution, the appropriate test is wilcoxon signed rank test. table  <dig> shows the results from statistical comparison of the distributions of the similarities. as expected, seed sequences within cmms were significantly more similar than those between cmms. in contrast, mature mirna sequence did not achieve statistical significance. neither did precursor mirna sequence.

very interestingly, however, secondary structure of precursor mirna showed statistically significant differences such that precursor structure comparison showed even much smaller p-values than seed sequence comparison, which is believed to be the primary regulatory element of mirna. although cmms tend to include mirna families as shown in table  <dig>  structural similarity of pre-mirnas within cmm cannot be explained by mirna families because many of them originate from different precursors. moreover, a cmm tends to contain more than one mirna families and structural similarity of pre-mirna is even bigger than seed sequence similarity . it is suggested that pre-mirna secondary structure may be involved in the expression of mature mirna's function.

evaluation
to evaluate the efficiency of our pipeline, we compared target gene enrichment scores of our mirna modules with those of mirna modules from previous study using enrichment scores provided by david gene functional classification  <cit> .

the enrichment scores are intended to order the relative importance of the gene groups. a higher score indicates that the group members are involved in more important  roles. the enrichment score of each group is measured by the geometric mean of the ease scores  associated with the enriched annotation terms that belong to this gene group.

we used wilcoxon rank sum test to compare target gene enrichment scores between this study and previous study. a statistically significant difference in the target gene enrichment score distribution was observed . in addition, in order to compare the distribution of enrichment scores of target genes between this study and previous study, we made boxplot and density plot ). these plots show that the enrichment scores of targets genes in the mirna modules obtained from this study are statistically significantly higher than those from previous study. in conclusion, we can demonstrate that our pipeline for finding mirna modules is more efficient than previous method in terms of enrichment of target gene function.

discussion
mirnas can bind to one gene  <cit>  and the target sites may overlap to some degree  <cit> . in many studies, individual effect of a mirna may appear to be small but when they cooperate, the effect can be of significant proportions  <cit> . sætrom et al.  observed that lin- <dig> down-regulation in c. elegans requires cooperativity between three mirna sites  <cit> . mavrakis et al.  showed that a small set of mirnas are responsible for the cooperative suppression of several tumor-suppressor genes in t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia   <cit> . cooperativity therefore provides the mechanistic basis for reading out combinatorial expression patterns of mirnas.

network-based approach of the present study aims to investigate cooperative translational control of mirnas. we constructed mran and showed that cmms share their transcription factors in the association network. transcription factors may bind directly to the pri-mir and/or pre-mir to regulate their processing  <cit> . tfbs within pre-mirs might serve specifically to regulate transcription of the primary mirna gene transcript  itself as well as transcription of nearby downstream genes. it may be a crucial factor that co-regulating mirnas act cooperatively to target genes.

it is demonstrated that individual mirna may interact with different mirna partners in a condition-specific manner. some mirnas may act as 'global facilitator mirnas' that assist their target-specific partners in their functions. they may inhibit their target genes depending on conditions and partner mirnas, enabling a post-transcriptional response that integrates multiple environmental signals and pathways.

mirna biosynthesis can no longer be viewed as one general pathway universal to all mirnas. many steps can be performed in multiple ways, omitted or replaced, and are affected by different mechanisms for individual mirnas. most importantly, these specific differences in mirna processing suggest multiple opportunities for post-transcriptional regulation of mirna expression  <cit> . we found that the secondary structures of pre-mirnas in cmms are highly similar. on the contrary, pre-mirnas in cmms are not similar at the sequence level. the secondary structures of pre-mirnas have been reported to serve as a signature motif that is recognized by the nuclear export factor exportin- <dig> in the biogenesis of mirna  <cit> . structure-function study raises the possibility of the involvement of pre-mirna secondary structure into specific functions of targets via different mirna biogenesis pathways. it has been further reported that the processing of pre-mirnas is specifically regulated  <cit> . these differential processes potentially may have caused selection of distinctive structural features that are involved in discriminating regulatory interactions. although the seed sequences of mirnas in cmms are mostly similar , there is no one-to-one mapping between cmms and seed sequences. instead, cmms seem to respond to a small group of similar seeds that may be shifted from the usual position  to, e.g. the positions 1- <dig> or 4- <dig> 

our results highlight the potential importance of the secondary structures of pre-mirnas in both cooperativity and specificity of target genes. vermeulen et al. identified the features of mirna structure that affects dicer specificity and efficiency showing that various attributes of the 3' end structure which play a primary role in determining the position of dicer cleavage  <cit> . in addition, the functional regulatory networks of mirnas can provide insights into the intricacies of mirna processing. the systematic study of identifying co-regulating mirnas showed that specifically regulated processing of pre-mirnas may have caused selection of distinctive structural features that are involved in discriminating regulatory interactions. it lends further credibility to the hypothesis that structural subclasses could be associated with processing differences of the precursors.

CONCLUSIONS
cooperative signal integration on target genes of mirnas is key features of the control of translation by mirnas. here, we constructed mran using cmms to investigate mirna cooperativity based on integration of multiple genomic data sources. the functional regulatory networks of mirnas can provide insight into the intricacies of mirna processing. pre-mirna secondary structure is suggested to be involved in mature mirna function. in conclusion, the molecular dissection of mirna modulation will help to unravel their functional comprehension and escalate one level towards their molecular decoding.
