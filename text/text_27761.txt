BACKGROUND
transposable elements constitute a large portion of the genomes of eukaryotes and play an important role in genome structure and evolution  <cit> . they can be assigned to two broad groups, retroelements  and dna-only transposable elements . unlike the retroelements, dna-only transposons do not rely on a rna intermediate, but transpose directly from dna using a multi-step cut and paste mechanism catalyzed by a transposase that recognizes the transposon dna by its terminal inverted repeats  . class ii elements in eukaryotes can be categorized on the basis of sequence similarities into nine superfamilies: mariner-tc1; hat; p; mutator; cacta; pif/harbinger; transib; piggybac; and merlin  <cit> .

most elements of the cacta superfamily of dna-only transposons  contain the core sequence cacta in their tirs and so far have only been described in plants  <cit> . the prototypical cacta maize suppressor-mutator  transposon was one of the first transposons described by barbara mcclintock  <cit> , and subsequent studies have shown that most of its length is occupied by a single transcription unit, which can be alternatively spliced to generate four distinct transcripts  encoding different proteins  <cit> . two of these transcripts, tnpa and tnpd, encode proteins that have been shown to be essential for transposition  <cit> . tnpa protein has been shown to perform a role in reactivating the methylated transposon promoter and to repress active unmethylated promoter  <cit> , while tnpd protein interacts directly with tnpa and stabilizes its binding to dna  <cit> .

schistosoma mansoni, a digenetic blood fluke, is a major cause of schistosomiasis in humans and an important source of morbidity on a global scale. the disease is endemic in  <dig> developing countries, infecting about  <dig> million individuals, and an additional 500â€“ <dig> million are estimated to be at risk  <cit> . the s. mansoni genome is approximately  <dig> mbp long  <cit>  and 55% of its content is expected to comprise mobile elements or other repetitive sequences  <cit> . recently, independent transcriptome and genome sequencing initiatives have provided an extensive repository for the discovery of novel genes and repetitive elements  <cit> . despite the extensive description of retroelements in s. mansoni  <cit> , so far the presence of just a single dna-only transposon, belonging to the merlin family, has been reported in this organism  <cit> .

using the public repository of s. mansoni sequence data as a starting point, we describe a novel s. mansoni transposon named smtrc <dig>  an element that shares several characteristics with plant cacta transposons, which suggests a distant relationship between these elements. a survey of complete genomes from the animal and fungi kingdoms revealed novel families of dna transposons belonging to the cacta superfamily.

RESULTS
isolation of smtrc <dig> clones from s. mansoni genome
our attention was drawn to the s. mansoni genomic sequence of supercontig_ <dig> available at the wellcome trust sanger institute  <cit>  while we were manually examining the splicing pattern of the gene represented by transcript smae c <dig>   <cit> . three exons of the latter mapped to bases  <dig> to  <dig>   <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig> of supercontig_ <dig>  upon examining the intron formed between bases  <dig> to  <dig> we detected a  <dig>  kbp element that extended between bases  <dig> and  <dig> with one open reading frame  of  <dig>  bp, which codes for a sequence with similarity  to a dna-only transposon. an inverted repeat motif was found at both extremities , suggesting that this intron is an inserted mobile element . although the element may be considered large  in comparison, for example, to mariner family transposons   <cit> , it is considerably smaller than cacta elements such as spm/en   <cit>  and rim coding elements   <cit> . we detected several other copies of the element in the s. mansoni genome sequence dataset displaying a perfect  <dig> bp inverted repeat at both extremities, confirming the sequence and correct length of the transposon inverted repeat  . we named these elements smtrc <dig>  because of its several similarities to transposons of the cacta family, as described in the text below.

we found a  <dig> bp direct repeat suggestive of target site duplication flanking the inverted repeat in  <dig> out of  <dig>  of the copies of these elements analyzed . three of these copies were found to be inserted into repetitive elements of the s. mansoni genome. two of them were inserted into copies of the s. mansoni ltr retrotransposons saci- <dig> and saci- <dig>  <cit>  and one into an unidentified repetitive element of which there are at least  <dig> copies in the preliminary assembly of the s. mansoni genome. when the flanking sequences of these three elements were aligned with paralogous sequence copies of the respective repetitive element  obtained from either the gss or the nr databases at genbank, it was clear that the original repetitive element  contained none of the direct repeats flanking the smtrc <dig> elements ; one of the 2bp direct repeat motifs was missing from the original repetitive element. this suggests that the direct repeats are in fact target-site duplications created by insertion of the smtrc <dig> element. it is well known that transposon integration results in the duplication of a short host sequence at the insertion site and that the length of the target-site duplication is determined by the properties of each transposase  <cit> , therefore these data provide further evidence for the mobility of smtrc <dig> elements.

using different combinations of a set of primers designed from the extremities of the transposon sequence from supercontig_ <dig>  we performed several pcr reactions to amplify genomic copies of smtrc <dig>  a typical result is shown in figure 1a; the major products are approximately  <dig>  kbp. cloning and sequencing of this major band revealed a  <dig> bp clone that represented a truncated copy of smtrc <dig>  which we designated smtrc1d <dig> . this element displays a truncated orf that codes for only  <dig> amino acids out of the  <dig> deduced from the full-length transposon. the entire sequence of smtrc1d <dig> aligns with the full-length genomic transposon, but it lacks part of the orf and its 3' tandem repeat , hence its short length. the diversity of lower molecular weight bands generated by pcr  suggests that smtrc <dig> copies of several sizes, differently truncated, must exist in the s. mansoni genome.

for one set of pcr amplifications with genomic dna as template, we used a  <dig> bp region downstream from the left tir as forward primer, and a sequence composed of  <dig> bp overlapping the 3'-end of the right tir plus a  <dig> bp region immediately downstream as reverse primer. this primer set permitted a copy of approximately  <dig>  kb to be amplified; this copy was cloned and sequenced . the sequence was named smtrc1f1; it lacked  <dig> bp at its 5'-end, including the left tir, owing to the design of the primer used in the amplification reaction, but otherwise it appears to represent an integral copy of smtrc <dig> . in fact, this clone displays  <dig>  % nucleotide identity  with the element described in supercontig_ <dig>  and one base in the left tir is deleted in both sequences. this suggests that we had cloned from the pcr products a copy representing the sequence contained in supercontig_0018735; the nine mismatched bases may have arisen from mutations generated either naturally in the field among the copies from individual parasites, or artificially from the taq polymerase during the pcr amplification step.

identification of trc transposons in other species
a blastp search against the nr database at genbank was performed using the protein encoded by smtrc1-orf as query. the highest hits produced were with two proteins of unknown function from schistosoma japonicum   and anopheles gambiae  . the next best hits  were with the tnpd proteins of cacta transposons from oryza sativa. it is worth noting that the region displaying similarity corresponds exactly to the transposase_ <dig> domain . in fact, as described below, global alignment of this region of the smtrc1-orf product with the transposase_ <dig> domains of cacta transposons indicates several conserved residues.

the smtrc1-orf sequence was used as query to perform an additional tblastn search directly into several complete animal and fungal genomes using the genomic blast tool at ncbi. this search produced hits indicating high similarity  between the deduced smtrc1-orf translated sequence and translated sequences from genomes of such diverse animals as strongylocentrotus purpuratus, ciona intestinalis, danio rerio and aedes aegypti. in all these cases, practically the whole protein was aligned, not only the transposase_ <dig> domain. the search against fungal genomes produced hits indicating moderate similarity  between the deduced smtrc1-orf translated sequence and translated sequences from the genomes of e.g. rhizopus oryzae, coprinopsis cinerea and phanerochaete chrysosporium. for several of the above organisms, multiple hits were generated in the tblastn searches against the genomic sequence, indicating that more than one copy must be present in their genomes.

as noted earlier, smtrc <dig> has a  <dig> bp tir sequence at its extremities, which is consistently present in all copies examined. also, the s. mansoni tir sequence has an internal repeat of the motif aaaggggaaataaag. a trc element of approximately  <dig>  kb was detected in the tribolium castaneum genomic sequence , and displays at its extremities an inverted repeat of  <dig> bp with the sequence ccctagtagcaccgaatatttgtaaaa. in addition, we found a  <dig> bp inverted repeat  flanking a trc in an a. aegypti genomic segment  that delimits a  <dig>  kb element. both elements have a  <dig> bp direct repeat adjacent to each inverted repeat , suggesting that target site duplication occurred when the mobile elements were inserted, analogous to the situation in the s. mansoni genomic sequences.

it is interesting to note that the first  <dig> bases in the tirs from the t. castaneum and a. aegypti elements are identical to those in the tir of s. mansoni , suggesting that animal trcs may display a ccc core sequence in their tirs analogous to the cacta core sequence in tirs from cacta transposons. comparison of these animal tirs with those of the plant cacta transposons showed a high similarity between the t. castaneum tir core sequence and the cacta core sequence of plants, with only one mismatched base . no such level of similarity is found in s. mansoni or a. aegypti tir core sequences, which display only  <dig> and  <dig> coincident bases, respectively. owing to the low numbers of bases and examples involved, it is difficult to determine whether the matching bases in t. castaneum are coincidental or reflect an evolutionary process.

we have not been able to characterize the tirs flanking the orfs of trc elements in organisms other than those described above, namely s. mansoni, a. aegypti and t. castaneum. in some animal species, the tirs may have become unrecognizable because of mutations or have been lost through further recombination. another possibility is that some of these elements may represent domesticated transposases  <cit> , which no longer transpose but perform another cellular function instead. further analyses of these animal elements are warranted to determine which is the case for each particular element.

estimation of the number of copies of smtrc <dig> by southern blotting
southern blot analysis using a probe from the 5' end region of smtrc <dig> detected multiple bands when hybridized to ecori-digested genomic dna, showing the existence of multiple copies . in parallel experiments, we used the same number of radioactive counts and probes of approximately the same size for smtrc <dig> and saci- <dig>  a previously described s. mansoni retrotransposon  <cit> . this allowed us to compare the two hybridization signals directly to estimate the number of smtrc <dig> copies. the hybridization image was processed to measure the signal intensity in each lane. for each digestion, we divided the intensity from smtrc <dig> by that from saci- <dig>  the results from both ecori and stui digestions show that smtrc <dig> has approximately 1/ <dig> of the number of copies of saci- <dig>  . extrapolation of these data indicates that there are approximately 30â€“ <dig> copies of smtrc <dig> in the s. mansoni genome. amplification of smtrc <dig> genomic dna by pcr suggested that most of the genomic copies are not integral, implying that there are only a few full-length copies of smtrc <dig> in the genome.

smtrc  <dig> produces multiple spliced transcripts
mapping of the s. mansoni ests available at genbank dbest to the full-length genomic copy of smtrc <dig> produced a discontinuous alignment of  <dig> ests , indicating that messages transcribed from this transposon are subject to alternative splicing. moreover, several of the predicted introns contain the canonical gt-ag splicing sites at their extremities . the diversity of patterns obtained for different ests mapping to the same locus indicates that a number of variant messages are produced by alternative splicing.

intriguingly, no s. japonicum ests with homology to smtrc <dig> were found by either blastn or tblastn searches using the full-length s. mansoni element as query against genbank dbest. this contrasts with the  <dig> s. mansoni ests  that were found with an e-value lower than 10- <dig> by a blastn search against the same database. this leads us to hypothesize that these elements either have a much lower transcriptional activity in s. japonicum than in s. mansoni or have been eliminated from the s. japonicum genome.

to document the existence of alternatively spliced transcripts in s. mansoni better, we used the sequences at the extremities of many of the  <dig> ests known to align to smtrc <dig> to design primers for amplifying additional smtrc <dig> transcripts by rt-pcr using mrna as template. the rt-pcr reaction produced a strong amplification band of approximately  <dig> bp and sub-products of lower molecular weight, plus a faint amplification band of higher molecular weight, which suggests that full-length transcripts may be expressed at a low level . no amplification was seen in the control without reverse transcription, indicating that the amplification products were in fact derived from bona fide transcribed messages.

we cloned and sequenced these different rt-pcr products. mapping the different sequences to the full-length smtrc <dig> genomic sequence confirmed a diversity of splicing patterns, as already suggested by mapping of previously existing genbank ests . two of the sequenced clones  are similar in size to the major band from the rt-pcr reaction, indicating that this band may contain more than one product. these two products did not overlap the orf region, and the intron formed between their exons  <dig> and  <dig> does not display the canonical ct-ag splicing sites. however, mapping of these transcripts to the entire s. mansoni genome showed that canonical splicing sites are present at the extremities of the same intron in some truncated forms of the element . this indicates that these transcripts probably originated from truncated copies that are apparently transcriptionally active, being responsible for a considerable fraction of the smtrc <dig> transcripts detected.

clone b <dig> has an orf of  <dig> bp that is interrupted by a tga stop codon at bases  <dig> to  <dig>  however, alignment with the smtrc1f <dig> sequence shows substitution of the tga by cta, which codes for isoleucine . we named this hypothetical protein product smtrc-pra . in addition, a  <dig> bp deletion at base  <dig> of this clone in relation to smtrc1f <dig> produces a frame shift at the beginning of the message. this suggests that the transcript was generated from a truncated copy of this element and that degeneration has produced the stop codon interrupting the orf. clone b <dig> has a shorter orf that codes for a product very similar to the deduced n-terminal amino acids of the orf product of clone b1; this hypothetical protein product was named smtrc-prb.

although most of the ests exhibit a splicing pattern that does not include the smtrc1-orf sequence in any exon, the presence of a few ests mapped in the region of the smtrc1-orf suggests that it is actually transcribed and translated. we were not able to clone the high molecular weight products directly from the first rt-pcr using primers designed from the extremities of est sequences, but we designed a primer from the 5'-end of the smtrc1-orf sequence and used a primer from the 3' extremity of the transcripts. the ensuing rt-pcr resulted in the amplification of a partial transcript of  <dig>  kb . cloning and sequencing of this message showed that it was indeed derived from exons mapping to the smtrc1-orf as well as from other exons in the 3' region . it codes for an incomplete hypothetical protein product of  <dig> amino acids named smtrc-prc. a longer, complete version of the message encoding a longer smtrc-prc protein is expected to exist, including the transposase_ <dig> domain in its amino-terminal portion. clone b <dig> also exhibits a second orf coding for a protein of  <dig> amino acids,  <dig> of which are shared with smtrc-pra . in view of this level of conservation, we named this protein smtrc-pra <dig>  characterization of additional clones could eventually identify further alternatively spliced forms of smtrc1-derived transcripts.

the spm element of maize has been shown to display four different transcripts  generated by alternative splicing, each coding for a different protein product  <cit> . one of these transcripts  spans the entire region comprising orfs  <dig> and  <dig> predicted in the spm dna, which explains the selection pressure that maintains such orfs in the transposon structure. similarly, we predict the existence of a spliced transcript spanning all the trc1-orf to explain the maintenance of such a large orf and the conserved amino acid sequence observed on comparison with elements from other animals. the diverse splicing pattern of the transcribed s. mansoni messages results in distinct orfs coding for different proteins; only the transposase_ <dig> domain of proteins encoded by these transposons has a detectable similarity with proteins from cacta transposons. the other portions of the proteins encoded by these alternatively spliced s. mansoni transcripts appear not to be detectably conserved.

spm tnpa, a short alternatively spliced transcript that lacks the transposase_ <dig> domain, is apparently more abundantly transcribed in plants than the other, longer transcripts. this reflects the results of rt-pcr experiments suggesting that shorter trc transcripts are more abundantly transcribed in s. mansoni than the longer alternatively spliced transcript that includes the transposase_ <dig> domain. spm tnpd displays two orfs in tandem, one coding for tnpd and the other for tnpa  <cit> . likewise, clone b <dig> also exhibits two orfs in tandem, one coding for smtrc-prc and the other for a smtrc-pra-like protein.

smtrc  <dig> orf contains a conserved transposase_ <dig> domain
multiple protein sequence alignment  of the transposase_ <dig> domain  was performed using sequences from known cacta transposons from several plants  <cit> , together with the related domain in the deduced orfs from s. mansoni and several other metazoan and fungal elements identified in the present work by blast analysis . although there is a visible divergence between the domains from elements derived from different phyla, conservation of several residues is apparent . it is also interesting to note that the trc-like sequence derived from the fungus cryptococcus neoformans has several characteristics that distinguish it from the other fungal sequences, which are apparently very similar to one another.

three different conserved motifs can be discerned, marked i-iii in the aligned proteins . in most of the elements, a first conserved motif i/l/v-x-i/l/v/f-x-i/l/v/f-x2-d-g-x3-f/y-x7â€“9-w-p-i/l/v of transposase_ <dig> domain is present ; however, in  <dig> out of  <dig> fungal sequences this motif shows an interchange between tryptophan and glycine residues. this suggests that these two residues have an important role and that only the position of one residue relative to the other is essential for activity of this protein. in the second conserved domain , the fungal proteins show a level of conservation comparable to magnoliophyta and higher than eumetazoa. thus, only proteins from fungi and magnoliophyta have a proline immediately after the conserved glycine residue , and an additional p-l/i conserved motif in the middle of this domain; both are absent from eumetazoa. interestingly, we identified a l/v/i-d-x-l/m-h-x3-l-g motif in the transposase_ <dig> domain that is present in the eumetazoan trc elements  and also in  <dig> out of the  <dig> fungal trc proteins, but is absent in proteins from magnoliophyta.

among the conserved residues there are two aspartyl residues , one in the first and one in the third conserved domain, separated by  <dig> residues; this is very similar to the distance between the two aspartyl residues in the dde motifs in tn <dig> transposases  <cit> . there is also a glutamyl residue  in the conserved domain  <dig> in all but three sequences, two of which have this residue in adjacent positions and one in a position  <dig> residues away. it is possible that conservation of such an amino acid triad reflects a similar catalytic mechanism in the dde motif despite the different arrangement of residues. in this case its function would be similar to that described for the dde motif, which is presumed to coordinate divalent metal ions to promote catalysis of dna cleavage and ligation  <cit> . moreover, there is a conserved cxxc motif in the conserved domain  <dig> that is identical to the configuration of cysteines in the zinc-finger-like motifs  of retroviral integrases, suggesting that trc cysteines may also be involved in dna binding.

a phylogenetic tree  was generated from the three conserved regions  shown in the alignment of figure  <dig>  although the analysis does not permit a clear inference of phylogeny within the eumetazoan elements, it clearly shows the separation of the eumetazoa and plant branches . interestingly, three of the fungi elements appear to be distinct from the others, but one of them, the c. neoformans element, appears to be at a basal position in relation to plant transposons. with the exception of the latter, the analysis clearly shows the separation between plants, fungi and eumetazoa.

CONCLUSIONS
the dna-only transposable element smtrc <dig> from s. mansoni exhibits various characteristics, such as generation of multiple spliced transcripts, the presence of terminal inverted repeats at the extremities of the elements flanked by direct repeats and the presence of a transposase_ <dig> domain, that suggest a distant relationship to cacta transposons from magnoliophyta. despite these similarities, conservation of proteins deduced from this new family of transposons in relation to cacta transposons is restricted to the transposase_ <dig> domain. the presence in s. mansoni of multiple transcripts and a higher expression level of a shorter alternatively spliced transcript coding for an orf lacking the transposase_ <dig> domain suggests that similar strategies are employed by transposons from animals and plants. the absence of conservation between smtrc-pra/smtrc-prb and plant tnpa protein indicates that these s. mansoni proteins either have a different evolutionary origin or are very divergent. the latter is more probable since we could detect no similarity between the s. mansoni proteins smtrc-pra and smtrc-prb and any sequences encoded in other animal or fungal trc elements by blastp or tblastn comparison to the genomes of these organisms, suggesting that this protein is rapidly evolving. nevertheless, smtrc-pra must perform an analogous role to the dna binding function described for tnpa in plant transposons, and experimental verification of this hypothesis is warranted.

several sequences from metazoa and fungi code for proteins similar to those encoded by smtrc, providing evidence that this superfamily exists in branches other than plants. data from phylogenetic analysis of the transposase_ <dig> domain suggests a common ancestry for such elements, and indicates inheritance through vertical transmission before the separation of eumetazoa, fungi and plants. this organization permits a division of the cacta superfamily into  <dig> different families, each represented by one of these branches . the c. neoformans element appears to be an exception, being more closely related to the plant transposon family than to the fungi family.

in view of the evolutionary distance between these related elements, the few conserved amino acids of the transposase_ <dig> domain must be essential for tnpd function. these conserved residues are preferential targets for future mutagenesis experiments to determine the importance of the transposase_ <dig> domain for tnpd function, as they are expected to abolish or significantly alter the domain functionality.

discovery of this new transposable element in s. mansoni should help in obtaining a more complete annotation of the genome of this parasite. apparently dna transposons are not as widespread as retroelements in s. mansoni, since only  <dig> elements of the former type  and  <dig> of the latter type  <cit>  have been described. nevertheless, dna transposons may have a significant impact on the biology of the parasite. comparison between merlin and smtrc <dig> shows that these elements have very distinct characteristics, the former being more compact  and presenting a slightly higher copy number, with an estimated  <dig> copies  <cit>  compared to 30â€“ <dig> for smtrc <dig>  on the other hand, most of the copies from both smtrc <dig> and merlin elements appear to be internal deletion derivatives. several transcripts of both elements have been detected in the s. mansoni est database, suggesting that both are transcriptionally active.

in addition, it is interesting to consider the smtrc <dig> element as a potential new tool for insertional mutagenesis experiments in schistosoma and other platyhelminths; cacta elements have been successfully used for this purpose in plants  <cit> . moreover, other superfamilies of transposons have been widely used for invertebrate and vertebrate transgene experiments and constitute a valuable tool for analyzing gene function and effects on phenotype  <cit> . further studies on other metazoa and fungi elements from the family described here will certainly provide candidate vectors for several other organisms.
