BACKGROUND
crop plants have a narrow genetic base because of domestication and breeding. moreover, many crop plants have gone through a polyploidization bottleneck. introgressive hybridization with wild relatives, often described as alien introgression, is widely used to broaden the crop genetic base. bread or hexaploid wheat , which accounts for 95% of the harvested wheat crop, traces its origin to a rare hybridization event ~ <dig>  years ago involving t. turgidum l.  and aegilops tauschii coss.   <cit> . mcfadden and sears  <cit> , kihara  <cit> , and mcfadden and sears  <cit>  have reproduced this hybridization event to generate ‘synthetic wheat’. these two species, and wheat landraces, constitute the primary gene pool of wheat  <cit> . synthetic wheats and direct crosses between t. aestivum and ae. tauschii  <cit>  have been used to enrich the bread wheat genetic base. extensive wheat genetic resources and marker systems  <cit>  are transferable and can be used for mapping of alien introgressions  <cit> , characterizing genetic diversity  <cit>  and gene isolation  <cit>  from the primary gene pool.

tetraploid, emmer wheat t. turgidum l. arose ~ <dig>  years ago from a hybridization between t. urartu tuanian ex gandilyan  and a b-genome species, whose closest living relative is ae. speltoides tausch   <cit> . these two species, together with the a-genome species t. monococcum l. subsps. monococcum and aegilopoides, the tetraploid wheat sibling species t. timopheevii zhuk.  and d genome cluster present in polyploid aegilops species  <cit>  constitute the secondary gene pool. usually, wheat marker systems can be used to map alien introgressions from secondary gene pool.

hundreds of other species in the triticeae tribe contain genomes other than a, b and d, and these species constitute the tertiary gene pool of bread wheat. all of these species can be hybridized with hexaploid wheat to produce amphiploids, addition and translocation lines  <cit> . chromosome engineering approaches have been used  <cit>  to produce small alien transfers without linkage drag. cytological approaches have been extensively used to identify alien introgression lines. however, these approaches lack throughput and resolution and are not suitable when analyzing a very large number of progeny for detecting a rare recombination event  <cit> .

molecular markers can detect small chromosome segments not detectable cytologically and permit easier identification of the introgressed alien fragments. microsatellite markers have been used extensively in the primary and secondary gene pools, however, they have low transferability to tertiary gene pool species, and the lack of locus specificity hampers their application  <cit> . wheat est bin maps have been explored as a source of markers, but polymorphic markers are rare  <cit> . single-nucleotide polymorphism  markers have become the technology of choice for all organisms because of their wide distribution in genomes and compatibility with high, multiplex detection systems  <cit> . advances in snp marker development in wheat and the availability of various snp genotyping platforms now permit high-throughput and cost-effective genotyping  <cit> .

despite the progress in dna marker technology, mapping large and polyploid genomes such as wheat remains a daunting task. mapping and sequencing complex plant genomes can be simplified by dissecting the chromosomes by flow cytometric sorting  <cit> . this approach reduces sample complexity and enables analysis at the subgenomic level. flow cytometric chromosome sorting has been implemented successfully in many plant species, including cultivated cereals , barley, rye, oats, rice and maize  <cit> . recently, molnár et al. reported flow-sorting of individual chromosomes from ae. umbellulata zhuk.  and ae. comosa sm. in sibth. & sm.  and from their natural allotetraploid hybrids   <cit> . this study provided opportunity for the next-generation sequencing of individual aegilops chromosomes for the development of sequence-based markers and their application in wheat breeding.

ae. geniculata, also called ovate goatgrass, is found widely distributed in the middle east. a member of the tertiary gene pool of wheat, ae. geniculata arose from hybridization between the diploid species ae. umbellulata and ae. comosa  <cit>  and is an important source of useful genes for wheat improvement  <cit> . the ae. geniculata genome has been introgressed into wheat, and single-chromosome, addition lines were developed by friebe et al.  <cit> . previously, we have reported on the transfer of genes lr <dig> and yr <dig>  <cit>  and sr <dig>  <cit>  from chromosome 5mg of ae. geniculata to chromosome 5d of wheat. in this study, we present the first report on alien chromosome-based snp discovery and its application in mapping of alien introgression in wheat.

RESULTS
flow-sorting and sequencing of the 5mg short arm
the analysis of dapi-stained, chromosome suspensions prepared from a wheat–ae. geniculata t5mgs telocentric addition line resulted in histograms with five peaks of fluorescence intensity  . the leftmost peak represents telochromosome t5mgs, which was well resolved from composite peaks i, ii, iii and peak 3b of the bread wheat chromosomes; t5mgs was flow-sorted with  <dig> % purity. a random mix of chromosome and chromatid fragments contaminated the sorted fractions. dna amplified from flow-sorted t5mgs was sequenced by the illumina technology. in total, we generated more than  <dig> million reads of 100 bp from one-lane hiseq sequencing. after quality trimming and filtering, about  <dig> million reads  were used for mapping, providing approximately ~45x coverage for t5mgs. de novo assembly of the 5mgs reads resulted in  <dig>  contigs with length ≥ 500 bp and average coverage depth of 20x . blast against wheat est sequences showed that  <dig>  of the  <dig>  contigs may contain genes. sequence data generated in this study was submitted to sra database .

mapping of reads and snp calling
for mapping the 5mgs reads, we used 5as, 5bs and 5ds chromosome shotgun sequence assemblies provided by the international wheat genome sequencing consortium. a maximum of three mismatches were allowed for each read for mapping  on reference group of chromosome five short arm assemblies . depending on the references used to map the reads, only about 30%, 23% and 25% of reads could be mapped to the 5as, 5bs and 5ds assemblies, respectively. the mapped 5mgs reads covered  <dig> , <dig>  of the 5as,  <dig> , <dig>  of the 5bs and  <dig> , <dig>  of the 5ds assemblies . based on the alignments of the 5mgs reads, we discovered  <dig>  5as,  <dig>  5bs and  <dig>  5ds raw variations. after filtering with a coverage depth of  <dig> and a snp quality of 50;  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  high-quality snps were retained, which were used for further analysis after analyzing  <dig> base pair sequences in total . snp densities of the 5mgs sequences against 5as, 5bs and 5ds were observed to be  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  snps/kb, respectively, with an average of  <dig>  snp/kb. we searched against the wheat est and ncbi nr databases with blastn and blastx and discovered  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  snps located in the gene coding regions.

5mg-genome-specific snps
after mapping the 5mgs reads from ae. geniculata on the group- <dig>  short-arm assemblies of chinese spring, we focused on finding 5mg-specific snps. snps that had the same alleles on 5a, 5b and 5d but a different allele on 5mg were identified. it was found that  <dig>  snps have the same alleles in the 5as, 5bs and 5ds contigs and different alleles in the 5mgs sequences. these snps were putative 5mg-specific snps . to make sure that the flanking sequences of 5mgs-specific snps matched the 5mgs assemblies, flanking sequences of 5mgs-specific snps were blasted to the 5mgs assemblies so that the primers designed based on the flanking sequences would work for both 5a  and 5mg. to eliminate interference from variations that may locate in the flanking sequences, only  <dig> snps that showed no variation in the 100-bp flanking sequences of snps between the 5a and 5mgs contigs were selected .

snp validation
in order to analyze the authenticity of the discovered snps,  <dig> sequences with one snp each were randomly chosen from snp sequences and used to design a kaspar genotyping assay. of the  <dig> kaspar genotyping assays, six snps had identical alleles in wheat and ae. geniculata and two snps showed heterozygous alleles in ae. geniculata accession ta <dig>  on average, 84% snps were validated in chinese spring and the ae. geniculata ta <dig> .

for sanger sequencing-based validation, we tested  <dig> primers derived from snp sequences; three did not show any amplification in either line suggesting the need for pcr optimization. of  <dig> primers tested between chinese spring and ae. geniculata ta <dig>  the snp validation rate was ~84%, which was similar to the results from the kaspar assay.

kaspar assays were done on wheat cultivars chinese spring, wl <dig> and seven ae. geniculata accessions to test the applicability of the  <dig> candidate snps . sixty-nine to 85% of the snps showed different alleles between wheat and the ae. geniculata lines . approximately 10% of the snps were polymorphic between ae. geniculata accessions ta <dig> and ta <dig>  and polymorphic snps were tested on a subset of an f <dig> population  developed from a cross between ta <dig> and ta <dig> . of a total of  <dig> snps tested,  <dig> belonged to genic sequences and  <dig> belonged to non-genic sequences. snp validation rates were similar for both genic  and non-genic sequences.

application of 5mg-specific snps
addition lines
validated snps between chinese spring and ae. geniculata accession ta <dig> were used to identify 5mg chromosome in the chromosome complement of chinese spring wheat. in the 5mg addition line, 5mg-specific snps were expected to have heterozygous condition, because wheat chromosomes 5a, 5b and 5d carry the alternative allele. out of  <dig> snps, 97% detected heterozygous alleles , confirming the presence of both wheat and ae. geniculata chromosomes in the tested addition line .

substitution and translocation lines
out of  <dig> snps tested on t. aestivum cv. wl <dig> and ae. geniculata ta <dig>   <dig> snps were validated and showed heterozygous alleles in alien translocation lines ta <dig> and ta <dig> . nine of  <dig> snps  had a heterozygous allele in ta <dig> , and three snps  were present  in the translocation line ta <dig> 

two germplasm lines  were developed using ta <dig>  of the three snps  validated in terminal translocation line ta <dig> , two  mapped in ks11wggrc53-j . only one snp  mapped in germplasm line ks11wggrc53-o .

discussion
the gene pools with the wild relatives of crops hold tremendous potential for crop improvement for resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. in wheat, many alien introgression and translocation lines involving members from tertiary gene pool have been produced  <cit> . exploiting alien germplasm has been slow because of the time-consuming process of interspecific hybridization and isolation of addition and translocation lines with reduced linkage drag  <cit> . a number of approaches are available to minimize alien chromatin for reducing linkage drag  <cit> ; the most widely used approach is to induce meiotic recombination between alien chromosome and its homoeologous  wheat chromosome. however, the frequency of homoeologous recombination between wheat and alien chromosomes is low , and a large number of progeny must be screened to isolate recombinants with small alien transfers  <cit> . cytological methods, such as chromosome banding, genomic in situ hybridization  and fluorescent in situ hybridization , have been used extensively to identify introgression and translocation lines in wheat  <cit> , but these approaches are low throughput and have resolution limitations  <cit> . molecular markers have been used to identify alien fragments; but limited availability of alien, chromosome-specific molecular markers, especially for the tertiary gene pool species, hampers the characterization of useful lines with traits of interest  <cit> . as an example, only a small number of u- and m-genome-specific ssr markers are available, greatly limiting marker-assisted selection of wheat-ae. geniculata and wheat-ae. biuncialis introgression lines  <cit> . practically no non-radioactive markers were available for the analysis of the wheat-ae. geniculata introgressions described herein, and all previous mapping was done using rflp analysis  <cit> . qi et al.  <cit>  used est-sts markers to identify alien introgression lines, but polymorphism was very low and only three or fewer polymorphic markers were discovered for each arm  <cit> . because the selection was based on only a few markers, useful smaller translocation may have escaped detection. therefore, the development of a system for a user-friendly high-throughput method of identifying alien chromosome-based introgression and translocation lines as reported here is highly significant.

flow cytometric chromosome sorting has been a foundation of the genomics of the triticeae tribe  <cit> . molnár et al.  <cit>  applied the flow-sorting technique on the allotetraploid species ae. biuncialis and ae. geniculata and their diploid progenitors ae. umbellulata and ae. comosa  <cit> . their results provided an opportunity for the molecular analysis of wild aegilops chromosomes and developing aegilops chromosome-specific markers. to date, only a few studies have reported on the development of u- and m-genome-specific ssr markers  <cit> . in this study, we flow-sorted a ditelosomic addition wheat-ae. geniculata line to isolate the short arm of the ae. geniculata 5mg chromosome with ~95% purity. this approach reduced dna sample complexity and permitted the development of markers specific for the short arm of 5mg . approximately  <dig> million reads  of total sequence were obtained for mapping after trimming the data , and the deep sequencing data was used for snp discovery.

snp discovery using next generation sequencing  was successfully used in small-genome plants, such as arabidopsis and rice, because their reference genomes are available  <cit> . snp discovery in complex genomes without a reference genome, such as wheat  <cit>  and barley  <cit> , can be achieved through ngs. however, the lack of accurate reference genome sequences can create ambiguities in snp calling, which can be further complicated by the presence of paralogs and dna repeats  <cit> . we used stringent mapping parameters to minimize erroneous base calling and misaligned reads. our snp discovery was greatly assisted by the availability of 5as, 5bs and 5ds chromosome shotgun sequences and assemblies developed under the international wheat genome sequencing consortium survey sequencing initiative. only about 30%, 23% and 25% of 5mg short arm reads could be mapped to the 5as, 5bs and 5ds assemblies, respectively, due to the low coverage of 5mgs sequences on reference assemblies, small reads and probably the diversity of the sequences. our snp-filtering criterion was similar to that in previously published reports  <cit>  and yielded  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   high-quality snps . in this research we generated single end sequencing reads, assembled data provided us ~ <dig> contigs > =500 bp. blast against wheat est database of these larger contigs suggested ~ <dig> contigs with genes on ae. geniculata chromosome arm 5mgs.

the estimated snp frequency in our study was ~ <dig>  snps/kb of the total analyzed sequences. this frequency is slightly lower than those of previous reports; trick et al.  <cit>  found an average density of  <dig>   snp/kb and ravel et al.  <cit>  estimated snp frequency to be  <dig>  snp/kb  <cit> . the lower estimated snp frequency can be attributed to the low coverage of 5mg sequences on reference assemblies and a stringent filtering criterion. for developing m-genome-specific snps, we needed identical snp alleles in 5as, 5bs and 5ds but different in 5mgs. we aligned the 100-bp flanking sequences of the snps that were discovered based on the three references  and only those sequences were selected that showed 100% similarity on the flanking sequences of the snp. critical selection of snps against 5as, 5bs and 5ds yielded  <dig>  reliable 5mg-specific snps which were around 1% of total snps discovered.

our study identified ~ <dig>  chromosome 5mgs-specific snps, providing a quick approach for developing markers that would facilitate identifying alien addition and translocation lines. for m-genome-specific marker development, we shortlisted  <dig> sequences with unique snps. using two different snp validation approaches, we tested  <dig> randomly selected snps in wheat cultivar chinese spring and ae. geniculata ta <dig>  and the validation rate was found to be ~84%. we tested chinese spring, wl <dig>  and seven ae. geniculata accessions. when comparing chinese spring against all the ae. geniculata accessions, the average validation was  <dig> %, with a range of  <dig> % to  <dig> %. for another set involving wheat line wl <dig> and the seven ae. geniculata lines, the average validation rate was  <dig> %, with a range of  <dig> % to  <dig> %. these results indicate the fixation of more than 70% of 5mg-specific alleles in ae. geniculata accessions , suggesting the usefulness of these snps in multiple ae. geniculata accessions. we compared the validation rates of  <dig> snps . the validation rate for the genic and non-genic snps was very similar . the validated 5mgs-specific markers  will be useful for monitoring introgression  in ae. comosa, ae. geniculata and ae. biuncialis, because they share a common m genome. the kaspar assay used in this study provides a cheap and high-throughput means for identifying alien introgressions because one assay mix is sufficient for ~ <dig>  reactions. validated snps between chinese spring and ae. geniculata ta <dig> were used to identify an alien disomic addition line . approximately  <dig> % of the validated snps identified the addition line with heterozygous alleles , confirming the presence of both wheat and ae. geniculata chromosomes in ta <dig>  forty-four 5mgs-specific snps also were tested on wl <dig>  the ae. geniculata accession ta <dig> and a set of their substitution and translocation lines. as expected  <dig> %,  <dig> %, 25%, and  <dig> % of the validated snps showed heterozygous alleles in ta <dig>  ta <dig>  ta <dig> short arm and ta <dig>  respectively. these data clearly indicate the applicability of snp-based identification for alien addition, substitution and translocation lines.

we also validated two released germplasm lines  developed by crossing ta <dig> with two susceptible winter wheat lines jagger and overley. both lines were found to have 5mgs-specific snps mapped on ta <dig> suggesting that two markers  could be used for marker-assisted selection for disease resistance genes .

CONCLUSIONS
to conclude, this study marks an important step forward for utilizing wild and related resources of wheat. for the first time, an arm of an aegilops chromosome from the tertiary gene pool of wheat was successfully flow-sorted and sequenced by illumina technology. recently it has been established that using ‘fluorescence in situ hybridization in suspension’ approach  individual aegilops chromosomes can be flow-sorted with high purity from wheat-aegilops disomic addition and substitution lines . alternatively, advances in flow cytogenetics have made possible even the flow-sorting of aegilops chromosomes from respective aegilops species  <cit> . the approach reported in this article can be used for marker development from targeted flow-sorted aegilops chromosome and their applications in marker assisted selection . next-generation sequencing offers a cheap way to develop sequence-based markers for molecular analysis of aegilops chromosomes. the ability to purify chromosome arms of aegilops species will be very useful for physical mapping, constructing arm-specific bac libraries and developing ngs-based genic and low-copy sequences to make chromosome- and genome-specific markers. recently released flow-sorted chromosome arm based survey sequenced assemblies of all wheat chromosomes will be very useful in alien chromosome based genome specific snp discovery . mapped arm- and genome-specific snp markers can be used to identify alien chromosome segments with a gene of interest for pre-breeding in wheat improvement programs.
