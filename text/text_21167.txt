BACKGROUND
diabetes is one of the most devastating and prevalent diseases in humans. according to data from the  <dig> national diabetes fact sheet,  <dig>  million people in the united states  have diabetes http://www.diabetes.org/diabetes-basics/diabetes-statistics/. type  <dig> diabetes  is the most common form of diabetes and is often associated with a collection of metabolic disorders including dyslipidemia and obesity which substantially magnifies the mortality and morbidity related to t2d  <cit> . hypertriglyceridemia is the main lipid abnormality in t2d patients that usually occurs years before diabetes, and is a strong predictor of diabetes  <cit> . the genetic contribution to human t2d and related metabolic disorders is evident, and mostly follows polygenic inheritance  <cit> .

tallyho/jngj  mice are a polygenic model for t2d characterized by glucose intolerance and hyperglycemia  and show metabolic abnormalities including obesity, insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperlipidemia  <cit> . the th male mice exhibit a striking rise in plasma triglyceride levels at an early age when their plasma glucose levels are steadily rising  <cit> . on the other hand, th female mice do not exhibit this triglyceride spike although they maintain hypertriglyceridemia compared with age- and sex-matched c57bl/6j  mice. some degree of vascular dysfunction is also reported in th mice  <cit> .

in the present study, we performed a genome-wide scan to search for quantitative trait loci  affecting hypertriglyceridemia in th mice using male f <dig> mice from a cross of b <dig> × th. we also searched for loci linked to hypercholesterolemia, hyperinsulinemia, obesity, and hyperglycemia. finally, we applied a genetical genomic approach and assessed the data systemically for candidate genes at the qtls.

RESULTS
phenotypes in parental, f <dig>  and f <dig> mice
body weights and 4-hour fasting plasma levels of triglyceride, total cholesterol, insulin, and glucose were measured at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> weeks of age. at  <dig> weeks of age, mice were killed and the five regional fat pads were dissected and weighed. in the f <dig> intercross mice, where b <dig> and th genomes are mixed and reassembled, there was wide variation in trait values that even exceeded the ranges in parental mice . this indicates that multiple genetic variants between the parental strains were responsible for the expression of traits.

data are presented as mean ± sem. means labeled with different letters are significantly different from one another comparing b <dig>  f <dig> and th . wk, week; ig, inguinal; ed, epididymal; ms, mesenteric; rp, retroperitoneal including perirenal; sc, subscapular; sum, sum of the  <dig> fat pads above; b <dig>  c57bl/6j; th, tallyho/jngj.

hypertriglyceridemia appeared to be inherited in a semidominant manner since the mean plasma level of triglyceride of f <dig>  progeny was intermediate between the means of the two parental strains . hypercholesterolemia, on the other hand, showed a complex inheritance.

the f <dig> population showed a mean plasma glucose level that was indistinguishable from b <dig> strain, suggesting that hyperglycemia is inherited in a recessive manner for the th alleles . plasma insulin levels in f <dig> mice were between the parental values at  <dig> weeks of age, but became similar to th mice at later ages.

the f <dig> mice initially showed higher body weights than b <dig> mice, but comparable to th mice . however, at later ages hybrid vigor , where a first-generation hybrid displays superior phenotypic expression over their parents, was observed for body weights. increases both in fat mass  and lean mass  appeared to contribute to the increased body weights in the f <dig> mice.

significant qtls identified by composite interval genome-wide scans
we collected approximately  <dig> f <dig> male mice, and individual mice were genotyped with  <dig> simple sequence length polymorphism  markers at approximately 20-cm intervals. a genome-wide qtl analysis was then performed for the traits in the male f <dig> population at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> weeks of age. figure  <dig> represents the distribution of trait values at  <dig> weeks of age, with most traits showing approximately normal distributions, but a few traits had positive skew. similar distribution patterns were observed at all other ages for each trait . qtls with genome-wide significance levels > 5% are summarized in table  <dig>  lod score plots of genome-wide scans are depicted in figure  <dig> and  <dig> for traits with significant qtl.

phenotypic data are presented as mean ± sem. means labeled with different letters are significantly different from one another . chr, chromosome; ci,  <dig> lod support interval; %, total variance explained by r-square; ig, inguinal; ed, epididymal; ms, mesenteric; rp, retroperitoneal including perirenal; sc, subscapular; sum, sum of the  <dig> fat pads above; gw sig., genome-wide significance; s, significant; vs, very significant.

triglyceride
four significant qtls for plasma triglyceride level had age-specific activity; loci near d1mit <dig> on chromosome   <dig> for  <dig> week, d11mit <dig> on chr  <dig> for  <dig> week, d4mit <dig> on chr  <dig> for  <dig> week, and d8mit <dig> on chr  <dig> for  <dig> week. hypertriglyceridemic contributions were from th genome. th alleles for chr  <dig> and chr  <dig> qtls appeared to be recessive while chr  <dig> and chr  <dig> qtls were dominant.

cholesterol
a very significant qtl near d1mit <dig> on chr  <dig> was linked to plasma total cholesterol levels. the hypercholesterolemic contribution of the locus was from the th genome and appeared to be additive for all ages. in addition, a qtl near d3mit <dig> on proximal chr  <dig> was also responsible for the plasma total cholesterol levels at  <dig> week; the b <dig> allele at this locus was associated with increased plasma levels in total cholesterol, appearing recessive.

glucose
on distal chr  <dig>  a qtl near d4mit <dig> was very significantly linked to the plasma glucose levels, with  <dig> lod support interval  of  <dig>  -  <dig>  cm. for that locus, the th alleles were associated with increased plasma glucose levels, and inheritance appeared to be dominant for the th allele.

insulin
no significant linkages were observed for plasma insulin levels.

body weight
two significant qtls linked to body weight were identified near d11mit <dig> on chr  <dig> and d1mit <dig> on chr  <dig>  for both qtls, the th alleles contributed to increased body weights with dominant action.

fat pad weight
a significant qtl linked to fat pad weights was identified near d1mit <dig> on chr  <dig>  the th allele was associated with increases in all regional fat pad weights studied and appeared dominant for all except epididymal fat pad weights.

carcass weight
two qtls near d11mit <dig> on chr  <dig> and d14mit <dig> on chr  <dig>  respectively, were significantly linked to carcass weights . the th alleles and the b <dig> alleles were associated with higher carcass weight at chr  <dig> locus and chr  <dig> locus, respectively. the chr  <dig> qtl location overlapped the qtl associated with body weight.

epistasis and interacting qtls
a pair-wise genome scan was conducted to examine all marker-marker interactions and identified  <dig> significant epistatic interacting qtls;  <dig> for triglyceride,  <dig> for total cholesterol,  <dig> for glucose, and  <dig> for fat pad weight . when we compared these epistatic qtls with the single qtls identified by single-locus genome scans, no locations overlapped.

it was noteworthy that a locus near d19mit <dig> on chr  <dig> interacted with two different loci affecting plasma glucose levels, one near d15mit <dig> on chr  <dig> and the other near d12mit <dig> on chr  <dig>  at  <dig> weeks of age, mice that were homozygous for the b <dig> alleles at the d19mit <dig> locus exhibited a significantly lower plasma glucose level when they were homozygous either for the th allele at the d15mit <dig> locus or for the b <dig> allele at the d12mit <dig> locus as compared with other possible genotype combinations at the loci .

similarly, mice that were homozygous for the b <dig> allele at the d14mit <dig> locus on chr  <dig> had a significantly lower plasma triglyceride level if they were homozygous for the th alleles at the d7mit <dig> locus on chr  <dig>  .

candidate genes using genetical genomics in the f <dig> mice
in order to seek candidate genes underlying the qtls, we applied a genetical genomics approach using a subset of the f <dig> mice  with differential hypertriglyceridemia, but not overtly diabetic. we analyzed gene expression levels in four critical tissues associated with diabetes, including liver, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and pancreas. anova was used to identify associations between markers and gene expression in each tissue. in total,  <dig> gene expression traits in liver,  <dig> in adipose tissue,  <dig> in skeletal muscle, and  <dig> in pancreas exhibited an association with the markers tested.

among these, we searched for gene expression traits that were associated with the markers linked to physiological traits to select candidate genes for the qtls . when cis-acting transcript is defined as a locus residing within  <dig> cm of the gene location  <cit> , this analysis revealed  <dig> putative cis-acting transcripts; coiled-coil domain containing  <dig>  gene in liver for the hypertriglyceridemia qtl near d11mit <dig>  signal-regulatory protein beta  <dig>  gene in adipose tissue for the hypercholesterolemia qtl near d3mit <dig>  riken cdna 1700009p <dig>  gene in liver for the hypercholesterolemia qtl near d1mit <dig>  and chymotrypsin c   gene in pancreas for the diabetes qtl near d4mit <dig>  these  <dig> genes have mostly unknown association with lipid and glucose metabolism or obesity.

genes in bold are putative cis-acting transcripts.

as another method to select possible candidate genes, we searched for gene expression corresponding to genes located near the qtls that were correlated with physiological traits  <cit> . gene expression levels of many genes in adipose tissue were correlated  with body weights and/or fat pad weights . notable ones included insulin receptor substrate  <dig>  gene and monoacylglycerol o-acyltrasferase  <dig>  gene located within the chr  <dig> obesity qtl interval near d1mit <dig>  within the chr  <dig> qtl interval, insulin-like growth factor binding protein  <dig>  gene expression levels in liver were also negatively correlated with mesenteric fat pad weights. interestingly, we also observed increased gene expression levels of multiple chemokine  ligands, including ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  and ccl <dig> in adipose tissue, being positively correlated with body and fat pad weights. these genes all map on the chr  <dig> body weight qtl interval near d11mit <dig>

real-time quantitative rt-pcr 
we conducted qrt-pcr analysis for candidate genes obtained from the microarray data or literature search . gene expression levels of ccdc <dig> in liver, ctrc in pancreas, and sirpb <dig> in adipose tissue were significantly up-regulated in th mice compared with b <dig> mice. on the other hand, the level of gene expression of 1700009p17rik was significantly down-regulated in liver from th mice compared with b <dig> mice. the gene expression levels of irs <dig>  mogat <dig>  and igfbp <dig> were significantly down-regulated in adipose tissue from th mice compared with b <dig> mice.

apolipoprotein a-ii  gene in dyslipidemia in th mice
apoa <dig> gene maps to the distal region of mouse chr  <dig>  near the chr  <dig> qtl linked to hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia in the f <dig> mice. through transgenic and knockout studies it has been shown that apoa <dig> is involved in controlling plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels and over-expression causes insulin resistance and obesity  <cit> . in order to test if apoa <dig> could be the chr  <dig> hyperlipidemia qtl, we conducted sequence comparison of the coding region between th and b <dig> mice. there were  <dig> nucleotide substitutions in the apoa <dig> coding sequence, resulting in  <dig> amino acid differences in the two strains . the gene expression level of apoa <dig> was not significantly different between th and b <dig> mice in liver .

discussion
through genome-wide linkage scans using an f <dig> intercross population from th and b <dig> strains, we identified multiple qtls and interacting loci linked to hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, and obesity phenotypes. further, genetic study of gene expression in a subset of this f <dig> population led to potential candidate genes for the qtls.

some limitations of this study need to be recognized. first, marker spacing in this study was approximately 20-cm, which was at the lower end of the generally accepted marker density  for qtl genome scans  <cit>  and could cause underestimation of the number of qtls identified in this study. however, it has been shown that the power of detecting a qtl is barely influenced by marker spacing in the range of  <dig> to  <dig> cm, with most  of the power retained even at  <dig> cm spacing  <cit> . therefore, it is unlikely that there are qtls with stronger effect than were identified in our f <dig> cross. fine mapping studies to further define the qtls identified will provide further validation. second, measurements of plasma glucose, lipid and insulin levels are sensitive to multiple environmental perturbations, such as animal husbandry, testing procedures, and environmental conditions. this creates phenotypic variation that may result in less power to detect the genetic determinants for physiological differences or inconsistency in detected qtls across time. this may have caused the observed fluctuations in qtl locations over time. the third potential limitation was running microarray analysis on a small subset of f <dig> mice selected from the upper and lower tails of the frequency distribution of the plasma triglyceride levels without severe hyperglycemia. populations with phenotypic extremes are known to be most genetically informative as genes influencing to the disease should be concentrated in the extremes of the populations. thus, even with small number of mice, our data from multiple tissues did identify potential novel candidate genes that may be involved in pathogenic mechanisms in th mice.

in mice, apoa2b allele, characterized by ala61-to-val <dig> substitution, has been reported to be hypermorphic in increasing plasma cholesterol levels and appears in multiple mouse strains  <cit> . the same polymorphism of apoa <dig> gene was revealed in th strain, suggesting apoa <dig> as the candidate gene underlying the chr  <dig> qtl linked to hypercholesterolemia. indeed, many cholesterol qtls were previously detected in the apoa <dig> region in separate genetic crosses of mice and apoa <dig> was suggested as a likely candidate across the strains  <cit> . functional studies related to apoa2b allele in th mice are warranted.

unlike cholesterol, age-specific genetic loci were found for plasma triglyceride levels, suggesting that different genetic mechanisms are responsible for the onset versus progression of hypertriglyceridemia in th mice. it is noteworthy that the chr  <dig> locus linked to hypertriglyceridemia at  <dig> weeks of age overlapped the chr  <dig> hypercholesterolemia qtl. it might be speculated that the onset of both hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia shares the same genetic factors, but distinct genetic mechanisms are involved in the progression of the disease in th mice. this age-related genetic effect has been previously recognized and appreciated in complex traits including diabetes and obesity  <cit> . data collection at multiple time points provides power to detect age-dependent effects that can be easily missed with a single time point study.

the chr  <dig> and chr  <dig> hypertriglyceridemia qtls map near the loci previously observed for atherosclerosis in mice; ath <dig> on chr  <dig>  <cit>  and ath <dig> on chr  <dig>  <cit> . the authors proposed the angiopoeitin-like protein  <dig>  gene, containing a coiled-coil domain, as a positional candidate gene for the ath <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, angptl3-null mice show markedly low plasma triglyceride concentrations  <cit> . the chr  <dig> hypertriglyceridemia qtl maps to the region of tgl <dig> linked to serum triglyceride levels in kk/ta ×  f <dig> backcross mice  <cit> .

a major qtl for the hyperglycemic  trait was identified on the distal region of chr  <dig>  previously, several qtls for diabetes and diabetes-related phenotypes have been mapped in this region in independent cohorts of mice and rats  <cit> . among those, qtls directly linked to plasma glucose levels included nidd <dig> in f <dig> mice from nzo × non, a locus near d4mit <dig> in f <dig> mice from c57bl/ksj × dba/ <dig>  and nidd/sjl in backcross mice from  × nzo.

recently, the zinc finger protein  <dig>  gene was identified as a candidate for the diabetes qtl of nidd/sjl  <cit> . an allelic variation of zfp <dig> was observed in multiple inbred strains; allele carried by b <dig> and nzo strains causing truncated mrna was associated with reduced diabetes susceptibility, while allele carried by sjl and non strains producing normal mrna was diabetogenic  <cit> . it is possible that the th strain, which is close to swiss family strains http://jaxmice.jax.org/strain/ <dig> html, may carry the sjl allele of zfp <dig>  this notion is possibly supported by the observed higher gene expression of zfp <dig> in th mice compared to b <dig> mice .

body weight is a compound trait reflecting the weights of lean muscle and bones as well as fat mass. a qtl near d11mit <dig> on chr  <dig> was very significantly linked to body weight . this locus was also associated with carcass weight, suggesting its major effect on lean mass. among multiple body weight-related qtls mapped to this chr  <dig> interval  <cit> , the wg <dig>  locus behaves similarly to the chr  <dig> body weight qtl, affecting growth rate and carcass lean mass in hg/hg f <dig> population from a cross of b6-hg/hg x cast/eij  <cit> .

a major qtl near d1mit <dig> on chr  <dig> was linked to all the fat pad weights and body weights at  <dig> weeks of age. this chromosomal interval contains nob <dig>  significantly linked to adiposity  in f <dig> progeny from nzo and b <dig> mice  <cit> . several other qtls associated with body weights were identified in this interval in mice, namely w3q <dig> and w10q <dig>  <cit>  and bwtq <dig>  <cit> . the human orthologous region of the chr  <dig> qtl is 2q33- <dig>  based on known functional relationship to metabolism, a few genes mapped in this region, including irs <dig>  mogat <dig> and igfbp <dig>  are considered as candidates.

obesity has been known to be a low-grade chronic inflammatory disease  <cit> . in this study, we observed that the gene expression levels of multiple chemokines, including ccl <dig> and ccl <dig>  were significantly increased in adipose tissue of th mice compared to b <dig> mice. the gene expression levels of these genes were also positively correlated with body and fat pad weights in the f <dig> mice .

previous research found genetic determinants of diabetes and obesity in th mice in backcross population from f <dig> × th, including diabetes qtls on chr  <dig>  and chr  <dig>  and obesity qtls on chr  <dig> , chr  <dig>  and chr  <dig>   <cit> . two loci on chr  <dig> and  <dig> interacted with tanidd <dig> and tanidd <dig>  respectively. these qtls were not detected in the present f <dig> study. this discrepancy is not totally surprising. as the detection of a qtl is subject to the magnitude of phenotypic variation within genotypes, qtl results in an f <dig> and a backcross population from the same progenitors can be different  <cit> . for example, when complete dominance exists for the th allele of a qtl, the power of a backcross  for detecting this qtl is zero. similarly, qtl interaction effects could be affected by the choice of an f <dig> or backcross, in part, due to the absence of homozygous mice for b <dig> alleles in the backcross. another source of the discrepancy in results from the two studies could be the different physiological conditions of the mice. non-fasting plasma glucose levels were measured in the backcross study, while 4-hour fasting plasma glucose levels were used in the present f <dig> study. therefore, the present findings using f <dig> population should be taken as additional genetic information underlying the pathogenic mechanisms in th mice, not just an independent replication.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, using ~ <dig> male f <dig> mice from the b <dig> × th intercross we detected  <dig> significant qtls;  <dig> for hypertriglyceridemia,  <dig> for hypercholesterolemia,  <dig> for hyperglycemia,  <dig> for body weights,  <dig> for fat pad weights, and  <dig> for carcass weights. polymorphisms in apoa <dig> gene are suggested to be responsible for the chr  <dig> qtl linked to hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia. gene expression analysis added novel aspects and aided the selection of candidates and biological mechanisms for the qtls. future studies to define the molecular bases of these qtls will improve the understanding of genetic contributions in diabetes related syndrome in th mice and ultimately in humans.
