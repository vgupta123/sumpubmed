BACKGROUND
the basic morphological and genetic mechanisms underlying vertebrate limb formation are highly conserved, from pectoral and pelvic fins in fish to arms and legs in humans  <cit> . along the flank of the embryo the primordial limb fields are established at specific sites in the lateral plate mesoderm   <cit> . the limb first appears as an outgrowth of mesenchyme from the lpm, which is covered by a sheet of ectoderm. the distal ectoderm covering the limb mesenchyme specializes and thickens to form a transient structure called the apical ectodermal ridge . reciprocal communication between the aer and underlying mesenchyme promotes cell proliferation and limb outgrowth. physical removal of the aer, for example in the chicken embryo, results in cessation of limb growth and truncation of distal elements  <cit> .

in all vertebrates, one of the earliest determinants defining the forelimb field is the t-box transcription factor tbx <dig>  <cit> . expressed in the limb mesenchyme, tbx <dig> is required for forelimb development and its functional disruption in zebrafish, chicken, and mouse results in a complete loss of the limb  <cit> . tbx <dig> transcriptionally activates fgf <dig> in the forelimb mesenchyme  <cit> , and its secreted gene product then signals to the aer to induce the expression of ectodermal fgfs such as fgf <dig> and fgf <dig>  <cit> . fgf <dig> in turn signals back to the underlying mesenchyme to maintain fgf <dig> expression, thereby creating a feedback loop needed to support limb outgrowth and establish the proximal-distal limb axis.

the fgf signaling pathway is critical for limb initiation and outgrowth  <cit> . genetic disruption of fgf <dig>  fgf <dig>  or fgf4/fgf <dig> results in severely malformed or truncated limbs  <cit> . the secreted fgf ligands can bind to four fgf receptors , with fgfr <dig> and fgfr <dig> being essential for limb development  <cit> . fgfr <dig> is expressed in the limb mesenchyme and is required for distal limb and digit formation  <cit> . fgfr <dig> in the mouse is alternatively spliced into two isoforms, fgfr2b and fgfr2c, which are expressed in the ectoderm and mesenchyme, respectively  <cit> . knock-out of both fgfr <dig> isoforms results in a failure of limb induction  <cit>  and deletion of isoform fgfr2b causes limb defects due to a loss of aer maintenance  <cit> . while critical for proximal-distal limb patterning, fgf signaling is also an integral part of patterning the other limb axes. the expression of shh, a central signal in anterior-posterior axis patterning, as well as wnts and bmps, which participate in dorso-ventral axis formation, are all dependent on fgf signals from the aer .

we previously identified a member of the pdz-lim protein family, pdlim <dig>  to be co-expressed with and bind to the transcription factors tbx <dig> and tbx <dig>  <cit> . pdz-lim proteins contain an n-terminal pdz domain and one or three c-terminal lim domains. pdz and lim domains are both protein interaction modules, providing this multi-domain protein family with diverse interaction opportunities  <cit> . functional roles for pdz-lim proteins have been reported in signal transduction, cell migration, and differentiation  <cit> . in cell cultures and chicken and zebrafish embryos we have shown that pdlim <dig> regulates tbx <dig> nuclear/actin cytoskeleton-associated localization and activity during cardiac atrioventricular boundary and valve formation  <cit> . work in zebrafish revealed that pdlim <dig> is also required for proper skeletal muscle development and maintenance  <cit> . however, the common or distinct functional roles pdlim <dig> and related pdz-lim proteins have in organ formation in the developing vertebrate embryo remain poorly understood.

in the zebrafish, pdlim <dig> is co-expressed with tbx <dig> during cardiac and pectoral fin development  <cit> . loss of either pdlim <dig> or tbx <dig> function leads to a similar cardiac phenotype, a non-looped heart, although by opposing molecular mechanisms  <cit> . elimination of tbx <dig> results in a loss of tbx <dig> responsive gene activation while reduction of pdlim <dig> leads to an upregulation of tbx <dig> target genes at the atrio-ventricular boundary. along with the heart problems observed at later developmental stages, compromised pdlim <dig> activity also results in pectoral fin defects early in embryogenesis  <cit> . however, detailed analysis of the fin phenotype has not been performed. here we analyze the pectoral fin phenotype induced by morpholino knock-down and mrna overexpression of pdlim <dig> and provide the first evidence of a critical role for pdz-lim proteins in vertebrate limb development.

RESULTS
pdlim <dig> is required for pectoral fin development
the pdz-lim protein, pdlim <dig>  was identified as a novel binding protein and regulator of the transcription factor tbx <dig>  <cit> . pdlim <dig> mrna has been detected in several tissues of the vertebrate embryo including the limbs, heart, and skeletal muscle  <cit> . in the zebrafish embryo during fin development, using whole mount in situ hybridization, we first detected pdlim <dig> expression in the mesenchyme of the fin field at  <dig> hours post-fertilization  which was maintained in the fin up to  <dig> hpf . expression of pdlim <dig> was not detected in the aer . injection at the one-cell stage with  <dig> ng of pdlim <dig> antisense morpholino oligonucleotides, interfering with either protein translation  or rna splicing , resulted in comparable defects in pectoral fin development . at  <dig> hpf, embryos injected with mo <dig> produced phenotypes with stunted fin buds as compared to control siblings, indicating a possible defect in forelimb outgrowth . by four days of development in wild-type larvae the pectoral fins are clearly visible, while the pectoral fins of mo <dig> injected embryos were significantly smaller or absent . both control and morphant larvae were stained with alcian blue to visualize the extent of cartilage differentiation. in controls, all of the major cartilage elements were present in the pectoral fin . however, in pdlim <dig> mo <dig> injected larvae, cartilage development was severely impeded. in the majority of cases, only a fragment of the cleithrum bone along with limited unidentifiable cartilage condensation could be detected . some phenotypic variability was observed among mo <dig> treated embryos and occasionally slight differences in phenotype were visualized between left and right pectoral fins within single embryos. less severe pectoral fin phenotypes in morphant embryos resulted in larvae with elements of the cleithrum, postcoracoid process, and a greatly reduced endochondral disc . based upon mrna expression and gene knock-down data, pdlim <dig> appears to be required for pectoral fin development.

cell proliferation is decreased in pectoral fins after pdlim <dig> knock-down
knock-down of pdlim <dig> results in the loss of, or severely truncated, pectoral fins. one possible cause for the fin phenotype could be due to alterations in cell proliferation or viability. to investigate this, embryos injected with pdlim <dig> mo <dig> were analyzed at stages of pectoral fin growth between  <dig> and  <dig> hpf for cell proliferation using an anti-phospho-histone h <dig>  antibody or for cell death using tunel . wild-type embryos displayed an increase in p-h <dig> antibody reactivity from  <dig>   <dig>  to  <dig> hpf in the developing pectoral fin . at  <dig> hpf, in the pectoral fin field, mo <dig> injected embryos had a comparable number of dividing cells as wild-type . however, quantification of p-h <dig> positive cells revealed a steady increase of proliferating cells in wild-type pectoral fins as development progressed to  <dig> hpf, while cell proliferation remained at a low, constant level in pdlim <dig> knock-down embryos . although the fin mesenchyme is smaller in morpholino injected embryos , the cells in the fin field including p-h <dig> positive cells appeared to be more scattered in the lateral plate mesoderm. considering this, we used equal sized boxed regions in wild-type and mo2-treated embryos for analysis, which provides for a certain overestimation of dividing cells in morphant fins. even with this conservative measure, we were able to detect a significant difference in p-h <dig> positive cells at  <dig> and  <dig> hpf between wild-type siblings and pdlim <dig> mo <dig> injected embryos .

one possible explanation for lower numbers of p-h <dig> positive cells in the pectoral fins may be reduced cell survival after pdlim <dig> knock-down. therefore, using a tunel assay, we investigated apoptosis in wild-type and pdlim <dig> mo <dig> injected pectoral fins at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hpf . in wild-type embryos, at most only one to two apoptotic cells could be observed in the developing pectoral fin at any of the three time points tested . in mo <dig> injected embryos, a slight increase of apoptotic cells in pectoral fins was detected, especially at  <dig> hpf . however, quantification of the data revealed that the slight increase in apoptotic cells in pdlim <dig> morphants was suggestive but not statistically significant compared to wild-type pectoral fins . these findings indicate that loss of pdlim <dig> has no significant effect on apoptosis; however, the protein appears necessary for normal cell proliferation in the pectoral fin field.

pdlim <dig> knock-down embryos exhibit pectoral fin cell migration and compaction defects
knock-down of pdlim <dig> function leads to severe arrest in pectoral fin development and lower numbers of proliferating cells in the budding fin. we next sought to determine if the pectoral fin field was established correctly in the absence of pdlim <dig>  in previous work we have demonstrated that pdlim <dig> can regulate tbx <dig> activity, one of the forelimb/pectoral fin field markers essential for limb outgrowth  <cit> . the cells of the fin field are derived from a population of cells in the lpm that initially comprises both heart and pectoral fin precursors  <cit> . the tbx <dig> expressing heart and pectoral fin progenitor cells remain indistinguishable until the 18-somite stage, when the pectoral fin precursor cells migrate posteriorly and separate from the adjacent anterior cardiac progenitors. the migratory behavior of these cells has been shown to be dependent upon tbx <dig> activity  <cit> . of note, in wild-type embryos both fin and heart precursor cells co-express tbx <dig> and pdlim <dig> , and by  <dig> hpf, tbx <dig> expressing cells are completely separated into the heart and pectoral fin primordia . in contrast, tbx <dig> expressing cells in  <dig> hpf pdlim <dig> morphants were detected in the lpm between the heart tube and pectoral fin field, connecting the two organ fields . dorsal views of mo <dig> injected embryos also displayed a less compact pectoral fin field as visualized by tbx <dig> expression . in comparison to control embryos, at  <dig> hpf, the pectoral fin field was noticeably smaller in size and induction of limb outgrowth appeared defective . these results suggested aberrant or delayed cell migration of forelimb precursors into the fin field, although overall embryonic development did not appear significantly delayed in pdlim <dig> morphants as cardiac beating began as expected around  <dig> hpf.

the tbx <dig> downstream target gene, fgf <dig>  is expressed in the pectoral mesenchyme at  <dig> hpf; right at the time when the fin bud emerges from the lpm . although fin bud growth was disrupted, fgf <dig> was induced normally in pdlim <dig> knock-down embryos , suggesting that the pdlim <dig> mediated misregulation of tbx <dig> transcriptional activity upon fgf <dig> may not be the cause of the compromised fin outgrowth.

to further investigate whether the pectoral fin primordium was fully established, we analyzed the expression of the early specification markers fgf <dig>  hand <dig>  and fgfr <dig>  all of these genes are active in the lpm in the fin primordial cells  <cit> . fgf <dig> is expressed in the pectoral fin precursor mesenchyme and is functionally required for cell migration and compaction to the presumptive fin field  <cit> . at  <dig> hpf in control embryos, fgf <dig> clearly delineated the future location of the pectoral fins . fgf <dig> expression was detected after pdlim <dig> knock-down, although the expression domain was slightly smaller and appeared closer to the midline of the embryo . hand <dig> was detected in the presumptive fin mesenchyme by  <dig> hpf in control and mo <dig> injected embryos . however, in morphant embryos, hand <dig> expression failed to undergo mediolateral expansion in the lpm. expression of fgfr <dig>  which is thought to be downstream of tbx <dig>  <cit> , was detected in the compact primordial pectoral fin cells in wild-type embryos . in the morphants, fgfr <dig> expression was diffuse and did not display normal compaction , similar to the compaction defect of tbx <dig> expressing cells . in pdlim <dig> knock-down embryos, mesenchymal gene induction and pectoral fin cell specification appears to occur normally, however, early compaction of the primordial fin field is disrupted or delayed possibly due to incomplete precursor cell migration.

knock-down of pdlim <dig> does not disrupt pectoral fin mesenchyme patterning
molecular markers for early pectoral fin specification were normal in pdlim <dig> compromised embryos, although precursor cell migration appeared delayed and the resulting fin field was smaller and less compact. in order to gain a better understanding of the cause of the pectoral fin phenotype, we examined the expression of several mesenchymal markers involved in limb patterning. we first analyzed tbx <dig>  which is regulated by pdlim <dig> in the zebrafish heart  <cit> . by  <dig> and  <dig> hpf, tbx <dig> expression could be detected in wild-type embryos throughout the developing pectoral fin mesenchyme . in pdlim <dig> knock-down embryos, tbx <dig> expression was maintained in the fin mesenchyme, however, the expression domain appeared less compact when compared to controls . fgf <dig> is a direct downstream target of tbx <dig> in the forelimb  <cit> . as expected, in wild-type and pdlim <dig> mo <dig> injected embryos at both  <dig> and  <dig> hpf, fgf <dig> was expressed in the limb mesenchyme; however, at the later time point the fgf <dig> expression domain appeared smaller in the morphants and less concentrated to the distal mesenchyme . the detection of fgf <dig> in the pectoral fin mesenchyme of mo <dig> treated embryos suggested that tbx <dig> protein was transcriptionally functional and proximal-distal limb outgrowth had been initiated.

we next tested the expression of hand <dig> and shh, two genes required for limb development and involved in anterior-posterior patterning  <cit> . hand <dig> is normally expressed in the posterior mesenchyme of the developing pectoral fin . in pdlim <dig> mo <dig> injected embryos, hand <dig> expression was detected in the lpm between  <dig> and  <dig> hpf, though its expression was diffuse and covered a wider area as compared to the control embryos . similar to hand <dig>  shh is asymmetrically expressed in a posterior mesenchymal domain of the developing fin . at  <dig> hpf, in wild-type embryos, shh revealed this posterior expression, however, in the mo <dig> injected embryos no expression could be detected in the pectoral fin . of note, shh expression was observed in the floor plate of morphant embryos at the same  <dig> hpf time-point . expression of shh recovered in the pectoral fin by  <dig> hpf, suggesting the absence at  <dig> hpf may have been due to a delay in activation . despite the significant reduction in fin size at  <dig> hpf, shh remained asymmetrically expressed in a posterior domain in the pdlim <dig> knock-down embryos . another gene involved in patterning all three limb axes is msxc  <cit> . at  <dig> hpf, msxc was expressed in the pectoral fin mesenchyme in both control and pdlim <dig> morphant embryos . similar to the other mesenchymal markers tested, msxc displayed a very diffuse pectoral fin expression at  <dig> and  <dig> hpf in mo <dig> injected embryos compared to the controls . the localization of msxc in the mesenchyme adjacent to the aer appeared to recover by the later time-point, however, some msxc expressing cells remained in the lpm . most of the key regulators tested in the pectoral fin mesenchyme remained expressed in pdlim <dig> knock-down embryos, however, the overall size and domain organization in the fin field appeared significantly affected.

pdlim <dig> knock-down causes loss of aer gene expression
knock-down of pdlim <dig> results in a stunted fin phenotype , suggesting a defect in limb outgrowth. limb outgrowth requires continuous signaling between the distal aer and the underlying limb mesenchyme  <cit> . since gene activities involved in patterning the pectoral fin mesenchyme were detected in the morphant embryos, we next asked whether gene expression in the aer was perturbed in pdlim <dig> compromised embryos. at  <dig> hpf we detected expression of the fin aer marker msxd  <cit>  in wild-type and pdlim <dig> mo <dig> injected embryos alike, indicating that the aer had formed . the proteoglycan versican was also detected in the aer of developing pectoral fins of wild-type embryos . we have found versican to be misregulated in the heart of pdlim <dig> mo <dig> injected embryos  <cit> , and therefore wondered whether versican would be misexpressed in the pectoral fins as well. indeed, versican was either greatly reduced or absent from the pectoral fins in morphant embryos . another prominent aer marker gene is fgf <dig>  whose function is required to maintain the signaling loop between the aer and underlying limb mesenchyme for appendage outgrowth  <cit> . knock-down of pdlim <dig> resulted in a significant reduction of fgf <dig>  compared to sibling controls . the family member fgf <dig> is normally turned off in the fin mesenchyme by  <dig> hpf and subsequently expressed in the overlying aer . importantly, unlike in the control embryos, we could not detect the switch from mesenchymal to aer expression for fgf <dig> after pdlim <dig> knock-down, but we rather observed ectopic expression in the fin mesenchyme . therefore, the loss of fin outgrowth in pdlim <dig> morphant embryos appears to be due to a loss of proper aer function and disruption of the reciprocal signaling between aer and the adjacent mesenchyme.

knock-down of pdlim <dig> affects fgf signaling in the pectoral fin
the disruption and loss of fgf gene expression in the aer of pdlim <dig> mo <dig> injected embryos suggested a possible breakdown of the fgf signaling loop between the mesenchyme and aer. to further explore this possibility, we tested additional fgf signaling components in the pectoral fin after pdlim <dig> protein reduction. fgf <dig> is a zebrafish-specific factor that functions downstream of tbx <dig> in pectoral fins and is required to activate fgf <dig> expression in the fin mesenchyme  <cit> . at  <dig> and  <dig> hpf, fgf <dig> was detected in the pectoral fin mesenchyme of wild-type embryos  and did not appear significantly different in embryos injected with pdlim <dig> mo <dig>  or earlier time-points . in contrast, in  <dig> hpf pdlim <dig> compromised embryos, fgf <dig> expression remained in the fin mesenchyme and did not switch to the aer . ectopic expression of fgf <dig> in the pdlim <dig> morphant mesenchyme was maintained at  <dig> hpf with no detectable expression in the aer . we consequently tested two transcriptional targets of fgf signaling in the fin mesenchyme, pea <dig> and erm  <cit> . we could detect pea <dig> expression in the pectoral fins at  <dig> and  <dig> hpf of control embryos . however, in  <dig> hpf morphant embryos, pea <dig> mrna was absent from the lpm but appeared to recover by  <dig> hpf . despite the presence of pea <dig> expression at  <dig> hpf, its localization was greatly diffused in the fin and did not show the normal restriction within the mesenchyme . a similar result was also observed for erm, a gene normally expressed in the budding pectoral fin . at  <dig> hpf in mo <dig> injected embryos, we could not detect erm mrna in the early bud, but gene expression recovered by  <dig> hpf, although with a slightly smaller and irregular shaped domain than in controls .

sandwiched between the secreted fgf signaling molecules and downstream target genes are the fgf receptors, whose function is critical for signal transduction and limb formation  <cit> . we tested the expression of fgfr <dig> and fgfr <dig> in the developing pectoral fins of control and pdlim <dig> morphant embryos. at  <dig> and  <dig> hpf, fgfr <dig> was expressed in wild-type pectoral fins throughout the developing mesenchyme . in mo <dig> injected embryos; however, similar to other genes tested, fgfr <dig> displayed a loss of compaction . fgfr <dig> mrna was also detected in the fin mesenchyme of control embryos at the two time-points, with expression restricted by  <dig> hpf to the proximal and anterior portion of the pectoral fin . after knock-down of pdlim <dig>  fgfr <dig> levels were significantly reduced at  <dig> hpf and expression completely absent from the pectoral fin at  <dig> hpf . thus, there appears to be a gradual loss of fgfr <dig> function between  <dig> and  <dig> hpf . of note, expression of fgfr <dig> in the head and brain was not affected by injection of pdlim <dig> mo <dig> . taken together, these results reveal that, after pdlim <dig> knock-down, the expression of several components of the fgf signaling pathway known to be critical for limb outgrowth, including the aer/mesenchyme signaling loop, are misregulated or absent.

pdim <dig> overexpression does not alter mesenchymal fgf expression
the ectopic expression of fgf <dig> in the fins of pdlim <dig> morpholino injected embryos suggested that fgf <dig> maybe a direct target of tbx <dig> and subject to regulation by pdlim <dig>  in an effort to support this hypothesis and to complement the knock-down studies, we overexpressed pdlim <dig>  considering pdlim <dig> induced shuttling of tbx <dig>  injection of  <dig> pg pdlim <dig> mrna into one-cell stage embryos should sequester tbx <dig> from the nucleus, resulting in the downregulation of target genes. comparison of in situ hybridization for fgf <dig> between wild-type and mrna injected embryos at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hpf displayed no significant changes in expression . expression of fgf <dig> during the fin progenitor cell compaction appeared normal at  <dig> hpf  while the gene still transitioned from mesenchymal to strict aer localization between  <dig> and  <dig> hpf . in addition to fgf <dig>  we monitored expression of fgf <dig> after pdlim <dig> overexpression. fgf <dig> did not reveal significant differences at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> hpf between uninjected control siblings and pdlim <dig> mrna injected embryos . fgf <dig> revealed its typical dynamic expression from broad mesenchymal  to concentrated location in the distal mesenchyme adjacent to the aer by  <dig> hpf . in several mrna injected embryos we noticed a more pronounced fgf <dig> crescent shape expression domain adjacent to the aer, which is typical for a more mature limb and may indicate slightly accelerated differentiation caused by forced pdlim <dig> expression. finally, since fgfr <dig> was greatly affected after pdlim <dig> knock-down and significantly downregulated by  <dig> hpf , we determined the expression of fgfr <dig> after pdlim <dig> overexpression. similar to the observations for fgf <dig> and fgf <dig>  fgfr <dig> at  <dig> hpf did not display differential expression between wild-type versus the mrna injected embryos and stained the proximal portion of the fin bud . control in situ hybridizations for the tbx <dig> target gene tbx2b revealed, however, a reduction of expression at the heart av boundary as previously published , demonstrating that the injected synthetic mrna was functional. the lack of change in fgf <dig> or fgf <dig> expression after pdlim <dig> overexpression does not rule out that fgf <dig> is directly activated by tbx <dig> or regulated by pdlim <dig>  as maintenance of limb outgrowth and fgf <dig> expression in the mouse is independent of tbx <dig>  <cit> .

discussion
pdlim <dig> functions to regulate tbx <dig> transcriptional activity
t-box proteins including tbx <dig> contain nuclear localization and nuclear export sequences, enabling these transcription factors to relocate between nuclear and cytoplasmic cell compartments  <cit> . we have previously shown that pdlim <dig> is necessary for dynamic shuttling of tbx <dig>  sequestering the transcription factor to actin filaments outside the nucleus and thereby regulating tbx <dig> target gene expression both in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . for example, tbx2b and nppa are downstream targets of tbx <dig> during zebrafish heart valve development and can be indirectly regulated by pdlim <dig> levels in cells of the atrio-ventricular  boundary  <cit> . loss of pdlim <dig> function by morpholino knock-down results in increased tbx2b and nppa expression with excess valve tissue, while overexpression of pdlim <dig> by synthetic mrna injection into the embryo causes downregulation of these tbx <dig> target genes and reduced valve tissue. these experimental results lead to a model in which a balance of pdlim <dig> and tbx <dig> within the cell regulates transcription factor activity. does a similar molecular mechanism function during forelimb development? fgf <dig> has been shown to be a transcriptional target of tbx <dig> using in vitro reporter assays and in vivo during mouse forelimb development  <cit> . in addition, in cultured cells, pdlim <dig> can regulate tbx <dig> activation of an fgf10-luciferase reporter construct  <cit> . work from this study in the developing zebrafish pectoral fins, however, suggests that misregulation of pdlim <dig> does not cause significant changes in fgf <dig> expression. knock-down of pdlim <dig> did not result in an obvious upregulation or ectopic expression of fgf <dig> and respective overexpression of pdlim <dig> did not lead to an apparent decrease in fgf <dig> expression , however, the smaller fin size in the morphant embryos may obscure a correct assessment and contribute to this observation. interestingly, the zebrafish specific fgf <dig> has been placed in a pathway between tbx <dig> and fgf <dig> during pectoral fin induction . fgf <dig> is expressed in the presumptive pectoral fin cells in the lpm at  <dig> hpf and is maintained in the fin mesenchyme until  <dig> hpf, before the gene is downregulated and then activated in the aer by  <dig> hpf . of note, we could detect induction of pdlim <dig> mrna by  <dig> hpf in the budding fin, the time point when fgf <dig> mesenchymal expression is turned off. the switch between mesenchymal to aer expression of fgf <dig> does not occur in pdlim <dig> knock-down embryos; however, we could demonstrate ectopic expression of fgf <dig> in the fin mesenchyme up to  <dig> hpf . the fact that pdlim <dig> function can influence fgf <dig> expression in the fin mesenchyme, coupled with previous findings that loss of tbx <dig> results in a loss of fgf <dig> expression  <cit> , suggests that fgf <dig> may be the critical fgf target of tbx <dig> in the zebrafish fin.

based upon this suggestion we asked whether overexpression of pdlim <dig> would inhibit mesenchymal fgf <dig> expression before the normal appearance of pdlim <dig>  pdlim <dig> mrna injection, however, did not yield an obvious reduction of fgf <dig> or fgf <dig> expression levels at  <dig> hpf in the fin mesenchyme, a time window before endogenous pdlim <dig> appears . this may be because expression of pdlim <dig> and tbx <dig> in a cell does not automatically result in binding and sequestration of the transcription factor. this notion is supported by co-expression of pdlim <dig> and tbx <dig> in undifferentiated cultured chicken epicardial cells that have strict nuclear localization of tbx <dig>  suggesting that the interaction of both proteins is regulated by yet unknown mechanisms, possibly posttranslational modifications  <cit> . thus, early ectopic expression of pdlim <dig> may not be sufficient to result in failure of fgf <dig> expression. during the later stages  of limb outgrowth, pdlim <dig> overexpression also did not result in significantly perturbed fgf <dig> or fgf <dig> expression. the reason for this may lie in the possibility that tbx <dig> is not required for maintenance of fgf <dig> and fgf <dig> expression. recent experiments in the mouse have shown that tbx <dig> is only required for induction of fgf <dig> during limb initiation but not for maintenance during limb outgrowth  <cit> . if a similar regulation operates in the zebrafish, overexpression of pdlim <dig> in the fin mesenchyme, during stages after  <dig> hpf when tbx <dig> nuclear activity may not be critical, will have little to no affect on tbx <dig> target gene expression. this could explain why fgf <dig> and fgf <dig> are maintained after pdlim <dig> mrna injection. in contrast, loss of pdlim <dig> may act as a gain-of-function with regard to tbx <dig> activity resulting in ectopic fgf <dig> in the fin mesenchyme. consistent with this hypothesis, the genomic sequence just upstream of the fgf <dig> gene contains a putative consensus tbx <dig> binding element , which would provide a mechanism for fgf <dig> regulation by pdlim7/tbx <dig> interactions. additional experiments at the genomic dna level will be needed to fully resolve this point.

knock-down of pdlim <dig> causes persistent high levels of nuclear tbx <dig> and continued ectopic expression of fgf <dig> in mesenchymal fin cells, which likely accounts for fgf <dig> maintenance despite the loss of aer genes such as fgf <dig>  the expression of fgfr <dig>  which appears to be in a parallel pathway downstream of tbx <dig> during fin induction  <cit> , is induced normally in pdlim <dig> mo <dig> injected embryos but becomes lost at post-induction stages possibly due to the absence of reciprocal aer signaling. we hypothesize that the signal required in the aer to maintain fgfr <dig> expression during fin outgrowth is fgf <dig>  fgf <dig> is never activated in the aer of pdlim <dig> morphants and the downregulation of fgfr <dig> appears to begin when fgf <dig> is supposed to switch from mesenchymal to ectodermal expression. this new information adds to our understanding of vertebrate limb induction and outgrowth and allows the extension of current models . during limb induction tbx <dig> operates in at least two feed-forward parallel pathways. in one branch of the pathway, tbx <dig> activates transcription of fgf <dig>  which then leads to the expression of fgf <dig> and signaling to the aer. the other branch regulates via a genetic cascade leading to fgfr <dig> activation . during limb outgrowth after  <dig> hpf, pdlim <dig> in the fin mesenchymal cells control tbx <dig> activity by removing the transcription factor from the nucleus . as a consequence, fgf <dig> becomes down-regulated, allowing a switch from mesenchymal to aer expression. fgf signaling molecules, including fgf <dig> and fgf <dig>  emanating from the aer maintain fgf <dig> and fgfr <dig> expression in the underlying mesenchyme. the reciprocal signaling between the aer and mesenchyme becomes independent of tbx <dig> activity during limb outgrowth . although the new data presented here clearly demonstrate that appropriate regulation of tbx <dig> via pdlim <dig> is necessary for establishment of a functional aer through fgf <dig> expression, future investigations confirming this hypothesis may reveal the mechanistic details for pdlim <dig> regulating tbx <dig> balance and transcriptional activity in the developing forelimbs.

pdlim <dig> in cell migration and compaction
tbx <dig> has been shown to be required for proper pectoral fin cell migration during zebrafish development  <cit> . we also found evidence for defective cell migration in pdlim <dig> mo <dig> injected embryos . tbx <dig> expressing pectoral fin cells display delayed migration and disrupted compaction of the fin field. this defect does not appear to be due to an overall developmental delay in pdlim <dig> morphants, as the heart begins to beat in a comparable time window as uninjected controls. a similar phenotype is also seen in ikarus  zebrafish mutants, which lack fgf <dig> function  <cit> . in these mutant embryos, tbx <dig> expressing cells fail to undergo appropriate compaction at the pectoral fin field. the primordial fin cells at 18-somites express tbx <dig>  pdlim <dig> as well as fgf <dig> . considering fgf <dig> is a target of tbx <dig>  it is possible that pdlim7/tbx <dig> protein interactions regulate fgf <dig> expression already in the 18-somite-stage embryo. increased nuclear tbx <dig>  by loss of pdlim <dig>  would result in misregulation of fgf <dig>  this idea is supported by the similar compaction defects observed after pdlim <dig> knock-down and in fgf <dig> ika mutants . overexpression as well as loss of tbx <dig> causes defects in cell migration in cultured chicken proepicardial cells  <cit> . it is plausible that pdlim <dig> functions at an initial stage of migration, in part by regulating tbx <dig> balance in the nucleus and cytoplasm.

an alternative view would be that pdlim <dig> itself, by its nature as an actin-associated protein, may modulate actin cytoskeleton dynamics and in this way directly influence cell migration  <cit> . in this context it is of interest that members of the pdz-lim protein family have been reported to be involved in cell migration  <cit> . however, more direct experimentation is required to fully elucidate this intriguing possibility.

pdlim <dig> may be involved in fgf signal transduction
in zebrafish, knock-down of pdlim <dig> by morpholino injection results in severely stunted pectoral fins, decreased cell proliferation in the fin region, and a loss or altered expression of fgf pathway genes. fgf signal transduction from the aer is required for limb outgrowth and proliferation of the undifferentiated limb mesenchyme  <cit> . how might pdlim <dig> be involved in fgf signaling in the developing pectoral fin? the delayed migration of cells into the pectoral fin field, coupled with the reduced ability of the cells in the limb field to compact after loss of pdlim <dig> function, may contribute to decreased fgf signaling. the lower proliferation rate in the budding fins further equates to fewer cells secreting and responding to signaling molecules, lowering the signaling potential. thus, it is possible that a certain minimum threshold needed for signal propagation is not reached and the mesenchyme/epithelial reciprocal interactions required for limb outgrowth are not established or maintained. this scenario may account for the maintenance of mesenchymal fgfs but loss of fgf expression in the aer.

a second possibility could be that pdlim <dig> plays a more direct role in fgf signal transduction. pdlim <dig> can interact with transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases  <cit>  as well as with protein kinase c , a component downstream of the fgf receptor signal transduction pathway  <cit> . pdlim <dig> may be necessary as an adapter, bringing together transmembrane proteins and intracellular signal transducers. without pdlim <dig> function, the fin mesenchyme may not be competent to respond to either paracrine signals from the aer or autocrine signals, despite the expression of fgf <dig> and fgfr <dig> in the fin mesenchyme. the eventual loss of fgfr <dig> and misexpression of pea <dig> and erm, coupled with the lack of fgf <dig> expression, suggest a breakdown of fgf response in the fin mesenchyme.

however, the fgf pathway genes that remain active in the fin, such as fgf <dig> and fgf <dig>  may be a consequence of tbx <dig> misregulation caused by knock-down of pdlim <dig>  the ectopic activity of tbx <dig> could account for the loss of specific mesenchymal and aer genes. work by others has shown tbx <dig> to function upstream of fgf <dig>  which may be a direct target, and fgf <dig> during pectoral fin development . fgf <dig> expression may be maintained in the fin mesenchyme by ectopic expression of fgf <dig> as a result of increased nuclear tbx <dig> levels, despite the loss of aer signaling.

CONCLUSIONS
here we provide the first evidence for a role of a pdz-lim family member in vertebrate limb development. pdlim <dig> is expressed in developing zebrafish pectoral fins and is required for normal outgrowth. in line with the model that pdlim <dig> regulates tbx <dig> transcriptional activity by altering its subcellular location, during fin development this regulation appears to have direct consequences on fgf <dig>  loss of pdlim <dig> function results in ectopic fgf <dig> expression in the fin mesenchyme but lack of fgf <dig> induction in the aer, resulting in a breakdown of the fgf signaling loop required for fin mesenchyme proliferation and outgrowth.
