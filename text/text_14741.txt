BACKGROUND
lilies , a group of monocotyledonous ornamental plants, are one of the major bulbous flowers in the floriculture industry  <cit> . taxonomically, the lilium genus is comprised of  <dig> species, about  <dig> of which originate from pr china  <cit> . l. davidii var. unicolor, a mutation of l. davidii duchartre, is an important genus, both economically and ornamentally, in lanzhou, gansu province in pr china. it is renowned for its large size, white and thick flesh as well as sweet taste  <cit> , and its flaming and flamboyant color provide its ornamental value. besides, lily scales are a rich source of proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids, and bioactive compounds such as phenolic glycosides, steroidal saponins and alkaloids  <cit> . in addition, l. davidii var. unicolor bulbs, which are considered health food due to their abundant nutritional value , are used in chinese medicine in different forms as fresh bulbs, dried scales, as well as powder to treat heart and lung ailments  <cit> .

reproduction of the lilium genus can be achieved through various approaches, including scale cuttings, bulblets or bulblets on stems, bulbils, seed reproduction and tissue culture  <cit> . in all cases, the formation and development of bulblets are crucial in the life-cycle of this plant. despite the wealth of literature on horticultural production and tissue culture of lilium, the genetic mechanisms that govern bulblet development still remain unexplored and unclear. the growth and development of lilium bulbs are closely related to carbohydrate metabolism  <cit> , because carbohydrate can serve as building blocks and as an energy source for development of the photosynthetic apparatus. as the main forms of carbohydrates, starch and sucrose are crucial to the balance and coordination of multiple forms of carbohydrates  <cit> . starch-sucrose metabolism remains a hot topic in plant physiology and biochemistry  <cit> . however, starch and sucrose metabolism is a complex physiological process due to its close connection with soluble sugar, with dozens of enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism  <cit> .

in the non-photosynthetic cells of higher plants, sucrose, which is transported from the photosynthetic apparatus, is cleaved to its constituent monosaccharides, hexoses or phosphorylated hexoses, which can then be used either in metabolic or biosynthetic reactions  <cit> . sucrose is degraded by four different enzymatic mechanisms  <cit> . firstly, it is hydrolysed into hexoses  by cell wall invertase  in the apoplast . hexoses generated are then transported into the cytosol by hexose transporters . secondly, cytosolic sucrose transported from the phloem by sucrose transporters  may also be taken up into vacuoles for hydrolysis by vacuolar invertase  . both the remaining two mechanisms take place in the cytosol. thirdly, sucrose is hydrolysed into hexoses by cytoplasmic invertase  . hexoses are converted into hexose-6-phosphates by hexokinase  . fructose-6-phosphate  is converted into glucose-6-phosphate  by glucose phosphate isomerase  , but on the other hand, f-6-p can synthesis sucrose via sucrose phosphate synthase  . fourthly, sucrose is reversibly converted into fructose and uridine diphosphate glucose  by sucrose synthase  . then udpg is further metabolized to glucose-1-phosphate  by the action of udpg pyrophosphorylase  . g-1-p, which can also be transformed from g-6-p by phosphoglucomutase  , serves as a precursor of adenosine diphosphate glucose  by adpg pyrophosphorylase    <cit> . both g-1-p and g-6-p are translocated into the amyloplasts via phosphate translators , whereas adpg is translocated via adpg transporters . then, starch biosynthesis occurs in the amyloplast. starch can be chemically classified into two homopolymers: amylose and amylopectin. amylose is an almost linear α- <dig>  glucan molecule synthesized by agpase and granule-bound starch synthase  whereas amylopectin is a highly branched glucan achieved by a coordinated series of enzymatic reactions involving agpase, soluble starch synthase , starch branching enzyme  , and starch de-branching enzyme . the rate-limiting step is the synthesis of adpg from g-1-p and atp by agpase  <cit> . following the adpg catalytic reaction, sss catalyses the transfer of a glucosyl unit from adpg to the reducing end of the glucose chain  <cit>  . after elongation of the glucan chains by sss, sbe generates amylopectin by cleaving α, 1– <dig> glucosidic bonds and transferring the released reducing end to c <dig> hydroxyls to form an α, 1– <dig> branch point. following starch branching, sdbe catalyzes the hydrolysis of α, 1– <dig> bonds  <cit> . in particular, gbss is mainly responsible for the synthesis of amylose and long amylopectin chains .figure  <dig>

to date, some research on starch or sucrose metabolism has been reported in some bulbous plants, including gladiolus hybridus  <cit>  and tulipa gesneriana  <cit> . these studies indicate that starch and sucrose metabolism is crucial for the formation and development of bulblets. similar to other bulbs, the development of lily bulbs can be achieved by using photoassimilates for morphogenesis and the accumulation of reserve metabolites. sun et al.  <cit>  found that sucrose was the predominant transported form of photoassimilates in the phloem of l. davidii var. unicolor, from photosynthetic leaves to bulbs, where it accounted for most  of total soluble sugar; moreover, during scale cutting propagation, starch content in mother scales declined while a synchronous increase occurred in bulblets  <cit> . starch was hydrolyzed in the bulb scales and sugars accumulated resulting in the increase of reproductive capacity during storage at a low temperature , which indicated that the preparation for later bulb growth involves mobilization of carbohydrate reserves  <cit> . these clues from the literature indicate that sucrose and starch metabolism have a key function in bulblet formation and development. despite the significance of carbohydrates in the formation and development of lily bulblets, information on the role of carbohydrate metabolism and related genes is very limited. few studies on the variation of carbohydrate compounds during bulblet development have been reported yet  <cit> . for enzymes involved in sucrose and starch catabolism, low temperature  resulted in increasingα-amylase, β-amylase, sps and susy  activity, but decreasing invertase  activity in bulblets regenerated in vitro  <cit> . castro and clément  <cit>  suggested that cwin might be essential for soluble sugar partitioning in different fractions of the anther. however, the molecular mechanism underlying carbohydrate metabolism regulating bulblet development in lilium is still enigmatic. the classification of gene expression patterns associated with specific stages of bulblet formation and development and functional characterization of the encoded genes are critical aspects for understanding the molecular and biochemical events associated with bulblet development.

to broaden our knowledge of lilium global gene expression profiles and to identify the genes involved in bulblet formation and development, this is the first study to compare gene expression profiles during bulblet formation and development in the lilium genus by taking advantage of the next-generation high-throughput sequencing platforms illumina gaiix and hiseq  <dig> to sequence the transcriptome of l. davidii var. unicolor bulblets. furthermore, the analysis presented in this study identifies most carbohydrate genes and biological functions regulating bulblet development for the first time and highlights important biological processes associated with bulblet development in lilium.

RESULTS
collection of bulblets
the transcriptome of l. davidii var. unicolor bulblets during development was assessed, including physiological and morphological changes during a three-phase process. the first phase is the appearance of bulblets, about 2 weeks after incubation at 25°c. rudimentary bulblets, represented by 1– <dig> small white bumps, emerged at the basal end of the adaxial side of mother scales . the second stage is bulblet formation, represented by bumps that developed into bulblets with a basic shape, a further 2 weeks later . the third phase of bulblet development, which involved considerable enlargement and growth , saw a distinct and pronounced change in bulblet size.figure  <dig>

sequencing and assembly
after strict quality control, 10– <dig> million  reads with ~95% q <dig> bases were selected as high quality reads, and were used in subsequent analysis . using trinity, the reads were assembled into  <dig>  unigenes with a mean length of 630 bp. the n <dig> contig was 926 bp long and  <dig>  unigenes had longer sequences. on average, 70% of these uniquely mapped to the reference genome .  <dig>  coding dna sequences  were predicted to have a mean length of 526 bp.table  <dig>

gene annotation and function classification
the assembled unigenes were searched against swiss-prot and trembl protein databases to achieve validation and annotation, resulting in  <dig>   annotated unigenes. among them,  <dig>   and  <dig>   had significant similarity to known proteins in swiss-prot and trembl protein databases, respectively. to further evaluate the completeness of the transcriptome, we randomly searched the annotated sequences for genes with cog classifications. as a result,  <dig>  sequences were classified into  <dig> cog categories . at the very top, the clusters were general function, replication, transcription, and translation. in addition, carbohydrate transport and metabolism held a central position with  <dig> unigenes .figure  <dig>

there were  <dig>  unigenes that could be successfully annotated according by blast2go . the main distributions in the molecular category were catalytic activity , binding , transporter activity , structural molecule activity , and nucleic acid binding transcription factor activity . in the cell component, most frequent distributions were in the cell , cell parts , organelles , membranes , and organelle parts . the most representative distributions in the biological process category were as follows: metabolic processes , cellular processes , responses to stimuli , biological regulation , and cellular component organization or biogenesis . among all the functions, there were many processes involved in carbohydrate metabolism .

gene expression during bulblet development
the level of gene expression was determined by calculating the number of reads for each gene and then normalizing this to rpkm. most unigenes were expressed at low levels whereas a small proportion of unigenes were highly expressed . the variations in gene expression during bulblet development were analyzed using the ideg <dig> program to identify two-fold up-regulated and down-regulated genes with a p value <  <dig> . finally,  <dig>  differentially expressed genes  were identified. as shown in additional file 4: figure s <dig>  between  <dig> and  <dig> d, the gene-expression pattern changed steadily, but not dramatically . between  <dig> and  <dig> d,  <dig>  degs were detected with  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig>  down-regulated genes. the greatest changes in gene expression occurred at  <dig> d compared with  <dig> d. between  <dig> and  <dig> d, a total of  <dig>  up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes were detected.

pathway enrichment analysis of degs
kegg pathway enrichment analysis was performed to categorize the biological functions of degs. we mapped all the genes to terms in the kegg database. specific enrichment of genes was observed for  <dig> pathways in the  <dig> d vs  <dig> d comparison,  <dig> pathways in the  <dig> d vs  <dig> d comparison, and  <dig> pathways in the  <dig> d vs  <dig> d comparison. the first  <dig> enriched pathways between library pairs are listed in additional file 5: table s <dig>  notably, starch and sucrose metabolism constituted the primary pathway among the three library pairs. the expression of starch and sucrose metabolism genes is shown in additional file 6: table s <dig>  the other pathways were mainly involved in secondary metabolism, energy metabolism, splicing, and protein synthesis. these results agree with the findings from the deg analysis and suggest that starch and sucrose metabolism pathways might be more active during bulblet formation and development.

starch and sucrose concentration
breakdown of carbohydrate reserves was measured in mother scales from  <dig> d to  <dig> d . in the first  <dig> d, starch strongly decreased in mother scales to provide energy for the activation of bulblet formation; starch then continued to decline slowly . from  <dig> d onwards, starch content in mother scales once again fell sharply, suggesting that the development and enlargement of bulblets need nutrients and energy supplied by starch hydrolysis. meanwhile, the starch content in bulblets increased gradually during the entire development process, especially at the late developmental stage .figure  <dig>

sucrose content changed mainly at the beginning of bulblet formation , decreasing sharply in mother scales but increasing equally sharply in bulblets. hereafter, although the speed of starch degradation accelerated, the content of sucrose in mother scales and bulblets showed a steady decrease and increase, respectively.

verification of gene expression by quantitative real-time pcr
in order to verify the gene expression profiles of enzymes involved in starch and sucrose metabolism obtained from the rna-seq approach, quantitative real-time pcr was utilized to analyze the expression of  <dig> selected genes, which encoded agpase , inv , susy , sps , sbe , sdbe , gbss , and sss . the results of agarose gel electrophoresis demonstrated that all  <dig> primer pairs amplified a single band of expected size . the correlation coefficients  ranged in value between  <dig>  and  <dig> , and pcr amplification efficiencies between  <dig> and 105% were obtained from the standard curves generated using a 10-fold serial dilution of cdna . based on the rpkm in different libraries, gapdh was selected as the reference gene due to its almost stable expression , with a |log <dig> | value of  <dig> , a |log <dig> | value of  <dig> , and a |log <dig> | value of  <dig> .

the expression pattern analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr was almost consistent with that observed in transcriptome analysis . at bulblet appearance  and morphogenesis , the expression of susy homologous genes in mother scales was higher than in bulblets, while during bulblet enlargement , the expression of susy genes in bulblets was higher . both in mother scales and bulblets, the dominant susy gene was susy <dig>  however, susy <dig> showed a more drastic change – nearly  <dig> fold – in bulblets than the other two susy genes. meanwhile, inv <dig> presented a relatively high expression level and dramatic shift in mother scales and bulblets than inv <dig> . sps genes, in contrast, showed relatively low and stable expression both in mother scales and bulblets . in mother scales, the expression of sps homologous genes gradually decreased during bulblet formation and enlargement, and increased slightly at  <dig> d. in bulblets, both sps <dig> and sps <dig> peaked at  <dig> d, which corresponds to bulblet formation. compared with sps <dig>  sps <dig> changed more sharply. for enzymes involved in starch metabolism, those in the synthetic direction such as agpase, sss, sbe and gbss, showed a decreasing trend in mother scales and higher gene expression at bulblet appearance and enlargement stages , while enzymes in the cleavage direction  showed higher gene expression in mother scales than in bulblets .figure  <dig>

discussion
lilium bulblet formation and development transcriptome
high throughput transcriptome sequencing by next generation sequencing platforms illumina gaiix and hiseq  <dig> is a powerful and efficient approach for gene expression analysis at the genome level. to date, the rna-seq approach is widely used to investigate the transcriptome of plants for which the whole genome is known but is especially suitable for gene expression profiling in non-model organisms that lack knowledge of genomic sequences.

despite the economic importance of lilium, its genome is not yet publically available and there is limited sequence data  <cit> . besides, there are vast differences in cell ploidy and genetic characteristics of different lilium genotypes. as far as the authors are aware, this is the only report to use rna-seq to identify large number of genes involved in lily bulblet formation and development. in this study of l. davidii var. unicolor ,  <dig>  unigenes were obtained, demonstrating the successful use of the rna-seq approach to profile gene expression in a species without a fully sequenced genome. among them,  <dig>  unigenes were successfully annotated but about 30% of the genes in our transcriptome could not have functions assigned as a result of the limitation of genome information in lilium.

to obtain all the degs from rna-seq data, the expression of all genes was analyzed depending on the rpkm. based on the comparative analyses of the rna-seq datasets and public information about the metabolic pathway, one objective was to narrow down the number of candidate genes responsible for bulblet formation and development. finally, a large number of degs corresponding to starch and sucrose metabolism were detected, in addition to secondary metabolism, energy metabolism, splicing, and protein synthesis. these results indicate that the morphogenesis and growth of bulblets demanded the participation of carbohydrates besides genetic material. at  <dig> d, bulblets formed from scratch, therefore many of the genes associated with the early events of bulblet emergence were highly expressed. correspondingly, the greatest changes in gene expression occurred at  <dig> d compared with  <dig> d, with a total of  <dig>  up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes. these temporal gene expression patterns indicate that the stage of bulblet appearance  was the most active stage. distributing transcripts in go categories provided a molecular snap shot of bulblet formation and development. the biological process was the most prominent go category , and about 24% of all transcripts fell under the molecular function. among all functions, there were many processes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, suggesting that genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism play an important role in bulblet formation and development. the bulblet is an energy sink tissue for plant reproduction in which starch and sucrose are mobilized for photosynthetic organs and are broken down to sugars, which function as a precursor to essential metabolites. according to cog classifications, carbohydrate transport and metabolism held a central position, indicating that the morphogenesis and growth of bulblets demanded the participation of carbohydrates. this was also the viewpoint supported by the transcript abundance of different kegg pathways.

starch and sucrose metabolism in different plants
starch and sucrose metabolism is vital to plant development and the response to abiotic stress. firstly, starch and sucrose metabolism is of great significance in seed development. many degs related to starch/sugar metabolism were found in seeds of rice  sugary mutant, more than in the wild type ‘sindongjin’. detailed pathway dissection and quantitative real time pcr demonstrated that most genes involved in sucrose to starch synthesis were up-regulated, whereas the expression of the agpase small subunit was specifically inhibited during the grain-filling stage in the sugary mutant  <cit> . in wheat  grain, high temperature restrained the accumulation of starch with the concomitant lower expression of agpase, sss, gbss, and sbe genes  <cit> .

starch and sucrose metabolism is also crucial to fruit development. gene set enrichment analysis suggested that glycolysis and carbohydrate metabolism were significantly altered in puffed citrus fruit, with higher gene expression of inv and sbe, as well as lower gene expression of agpase and sss  <cit> . meanwhile, starch and sucrose metabolism is high during the development and ripening of mango  fruits  <cit> . during pineapple  fruit development, the large rise in sucrose was accompanied by dramatic up-regulated changes in sps, and a cycle of sucrose breakdown in the cytosol of sink tissues could be mediated both by susy and inv  <cit> .

starch and sucrose metabolism are dominant during flower blooming in rosa chinensis ‘pallida’  <cit>  and are also responsible for the increase of cold tolerance in blueberry   <cit>  as well as lilium lancifolium  <cit> , due to the accumulation of soluble sugars. moreover, starch and sucrose was responsible for subterranean organ formation such as in sweetpotato   <cit>  and potato   <cit> . the present study of the l. davidii var. unicolor transcriptome revealed a large number of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism . according to kegg pathway analysis, starch and sucrose metabolism constituted the primary pathway in the three rna-seq libraries . all these facts support the fact that carbohydrates are vital to bulb formation and development of bulbous ornamentals  <cit> .

gene expression during bulblets development
susy can catalyze sucrose catabolism reversibly but inv catalyzes irreversibly. however, susy is generally considered to be involved in sucrose hydrolysis rather than sucrose synthesis  <cit> . sps is crucial to carbohydrate metabolism by regulating carbon partitioning between starch production and carbohydrate accumulation. in our study, susy and inv genes showed relatively higher expression, but sps genes showed an overall decline in mother scales , in accordance with the progressive decrease of sucrose content in mother scales . this result indicates that sucrose in mother scales is mainly metabolized in the cleavage direction to provide energy for bulblet formation and development. in spite of their relatively faint expression, both sps homologous genes demonstrated high activity in bulblets during bulblet formation , in accordance with the bare expression of susy and inv family genes, which indicates that sucrose plays a critically important role in bulblet morphogenesis. this is because sucrose serves as a critical signaling molecule in relation to cellular metabolic status  <cit> , and as a signal in the regulated expression of micrornas, which are transcription factors that modulate plant development  <cit> . when bulblets began to swell at  <dig> d, the expression of susy and inv peaked quickly, causing the hydrolysis of sucrose to provide carbon skeletons for starch synthesis. the expression pattern of susy and inv at different phases suggests that susy and inv work cooperatively to cleave sucrose.

an increase in amylose content can be accomplished by inhibiting enzymes involved in amylopectin synthesis  <cit> , by raising the expression levels of gbssi  <cit> , or simultaneously by raising the expression levels of agp as well as gbss and suppressing the expression levels of sbe  <cit> . however, amylopectin is the main form of starch in lily, accounting for 70% of all starch  <cit> . this was demonstrated by the gene expression of enzymes involved in amylopectin synthesis, namely sss, sbe, and agpase , which was considerably higher than the expression of the amylose synthesis enzyme gbss . another piece of evidence was that sdbe homologous genes were highly expressed in mother scales. this is because both sdbe homologous genes found in l. davidii var. unicolor fall into the pul group, which has been proposed to participate in amylopectin disassembly  <cit> . the expression levels of genes involved in starch synthesis  in bulblets were distinctly higher than those in mother scales , while genes involved in starch hydrolysis demonstrated an opposite trend. the change in starch metabolism-related gene expression was in accordance with the starch content in mother scales and bulblets . in bulblets, genes involved in starch synthesis were most expressed at  <dig> d and later stages  of bulblet development, but rarely expressed at  <dig> d , indicating that starch is pivotal to bulblet emergence and development.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, using three developmental stages of bulblets of lilium davidii var. unicolor, which does not have a reference genome, we performed comparative gene expression at the transcriptional scale by using rna-seq. the transcriptome was assembled with trinity and functionally annotated with blast2go and kegg. a set of genes that might contribute to starch and sucrose metabolism were identified and genetic mechanisms of these genes related to bulblet development were discussed. gene expression, together with changes in the content of starch and sucrose, suggest that sucrose is crucial for bulblet morphogenesis while starch is vital to bulblet emergence and development. the results will certainly be valuable for elucidation of molecular mechanisms in bulblet emergence and development in lilium and related species.
