BACKGROUND
early cancer detection requires noninvasive sampling is for general screening populations. exfoliated cervical cells have been used for cytologic screening of cervical cancer. these accessible cells could also be ideal for molecular screening based on gene expression if their mrna can be isolated and is representative of the expression profile of the underlying tissue. we have previously shown that satisfactory rna can be isolated from pap smear material in amounts sufficient for microarray analysis  <cit> . however since exfoliated cells are keratinized and terminally differentiated, it remains to be demonstrated that they have an active mrna profile that adequately represents the molecular signature of cervical tissue. while one group reported success using exfoliated oral cells as a source of gene expression biomarkers  <cit> , others have not obtained satisfactory results  <cit> .

this study addresses the representation of gene expression profiles in exfoliated cells and full thickness epithelium. to further explore the possibility of using exfoliated cells for molecular screening, we compared the gene expression in samples with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade  <dig>  to those without or only low grade lesions .

RESULTS
gene expression profiles in cervical exfoliated cells and tissue
the mwg a, b and c human  <dig> k arrays include probes evaluating  <dig>  different genes of the transcribed human genome. of these genes,  <dig>   were detected in uterine cervix tissue and  <dig>   in exfoliated cells . of those detected in tissue,  <dig>   were also detected in exfoliated cells. genes detected in each sample type grouped into the same major go categories in the same order of abundance , although the numbers in each category were on average 20% less in exfoliated cells . the exception is the go category, regulation of gene expression, epigenetics, in which the few genes that were detected were only found in exfoliated cells.

ease analysis of the  <dig>  genes detected only in cervical tissue found the biologic themes of structural cell components, ribosomal function and structure, ion transport and regulation to be enriched relative to their representation on the arrays . biologic themes enriched in genes detected only in exfoliated cells were mainly differentiation processes like neurogenesis, morphogenesis, oncogenesis, organogenesis and development .

gene expression comparison of cin <dig> samples with cin <dig> and cin <dig> controls
of the  <dig> genes on the a arrays that were included in this analysis, the average expression of  <dig> were at least 2-fold greater whereas  <dig> were at least 2-fold lower in cin <dig> compared to cin 0/cin  <dig>  based on cv, the cin  <dig> class showed more heterogeneity than the cin  <dig> class  or the combined cin 0/cin  <dig> controls .

the univariate parametric p-values of the  <dig> most significant genes that discriminate between the cin <dig> and the cin 0/cin  <dig> groups selected in the brb array tools two-sample t-test ranged between  <dig>  –  <dig> . none had a false discovery rate  of less than 10%. the go class comparison yielded  <dig> categories significant at the nominal  <dig>  level of permutation tests. these were helicase activity, replication fork, dna-directed dna polymerase activity, regulation of viral life cycle, peroxidase activity, dna replication and endoplasmatic reticulum membrane, or a closely related subcategory .

sam yielded a trimmed list of  <dig> genes with a median fdr of  <dig> . nine of these genes were also in the top list generated with brb tools. among the first  <dig> genes that focus identified as agreeing best with the hypothesized pattern change,  <dig> were seen in brb array tools top list and  <dig> by sam. table  <dig> shows the six genes identified by all three methods. all were upregulated in cin <dig> by an average fold change of  <dig>  .

discussion
exfoliated cells from normal squamous epithelium are derived from the terminally differentiated superficial layers and may have a more restricted representation of the underlying tissue than those derived from a neoplastic epithelium where differentiation is reduced or lost completely. therefore results from the normal samples should provide a conservative estimate of the degree of similarities between cells and tissue. grouping the detected genes by broad ontology categories, the cervical tissue and cervical exfoliated samples showed a similar distribution, however exfoliated cells had fewer numbers of genes in each category. the genes in common between tissue and exfoliated cell profiles represented 50% of the total genes detected in tissue and 72% of the total detected in the cells. therefore, while much of the tissue gene profile is included in the exfoliated cells, this representation is only partial.

the  <dig> genes that were not detected in exfoliated cells could be expected to be involved in proliferation of the basal epithelium. even though the gos of these genes did not indicate a direct involvement of these genes in cell division they did include basic components of cell structure and function. interestingly,  <dig> of the  <dig> most significant gos were related to ribosome activity implying that the ribosomal complex is not renewed after initial establishment in the basal cells.

it is interesting to note that  <dig>  genes found in the exfoliated samples were not detected in the tissue. one explanation may be the presence of inflammatory or other cells such as endometrium that are not present in tissue. with keratinocyte differentiation the profile becomes more specialized as some genes are down regulated  <cit> . therefore, another explanation may be that the restricted rna profile allows genes below the cutoff in tissue to exceed the threshold for detection in exfoliated cells. this is supported by the fact that average signal intensity  of these genes was only one third of these expressed in both specimens. the observation that the gos of these genes were relate to advanced differentiation processes favors the latter explanation.

since we used only one cervical tissue sample we undoubtedly underestimated the true biologic variability introduced by age, hormonal status and other environmental factors. in addition, requiring detection in  <dig> of  <dig> exfoliated samples limits the transcriptome to those genes that could reliably and reproducibly be detected by microarrays. additional study, including cervical tissues and matched exfoliated samples from a spectrum of disease states would be required to fully define the extent to which tissue and exfoliated cell profiles overlap, nonetheless we conclude that exfoliated cells are worthy of further investigation as a source of molecular markers for screening.

to begin biomarker discovery we conducted a pilot microarray study of exfoliated cells from women with cin <dig> to those with no disease  or cin  <dig> to determine if differential gene expression could be identified and evaluate the degree of variation within disease groups to determine the number of samples that would be required to stabilize selection of differentially expressed genes. not surprisingly, the gene expression profiles of the two groups were very similar. based on cytology, less than 10% of the sampled cells are neoplastic, so the dilution effect on abnormal transcript profiles could be considerable. a "field effect", that is extension of molecular changes to an area larger than the histologically identifiable lesion, has been demonstrated in other cancers including head and neck  <cit> , colon  <cit>  and bladder  <cit> . there is some evidence that this may occur in the cervix  <cit> , but the extent to which this occurs is not clear.

using three different statistical approaches to identify differentially expressed genes resulted in lists of candidate genes with little overlap and relatively high estimates of false discovery rates. these inconsistencies reflect the relatively small differences between disease classes compared to within-class variation. we intentionally represented a wide range of age and race in this pilot so as not to over simplify the within-class variation thereby maximizing the specificity of the identified candidate biomarkers. interestingly, despite matching age and race between the disease groups, the within-class variation was greater for cin  <dig> than for no disease or combined cin  <dig> and cin  <dig>  this suggests that cytologically identical cin <dig> lesions may represent different molecular pathways to oncogenesis.

there were  <dig> genes that were identified by all three analysis methods. given the central role of hpv in cervical carcinogenesis it is interesting that one of these, the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme e <dig> variant  <dig>  participates in the degradation of p <dig> through interaction with hpv e <dig> protein  <cit> . similarly, it is interesting to note an over-representation of genes in the go "viral life cycle" in cin <dig>  while none of the others have been previously implicated in cervical carcinogenesis this is not too surprising, as their role may be restricted to premalignant lesions or to host response.

CONCLUSIONS
the primary goal of this pilot study was to explore the possibility of using exfoliated cells for genomic biomarker discovery. we conclude that rna from these cells can indeed be applied to genomic studies. exfoliated cells display an expression profile that reflects the tissue albeit with limited complexity. in addition, the characteristic expression differences between cin  <dig> and control samples  are small and future studies need to be designed to address these factors.
