BACKGROUND
auxin is a plant hormone that plays pivotal roles in the regulation of plant growth in response to diverse developmental and environmental events such as embryogenesis, organogenesis, tropic growth, root architecture, flower and fruit development, tissue and organ patterning, and vascular development . it has been shown that auxin coordinates plant development essentially through the transcriptional regulation of some gene families, such as auxin/indole-3-acetic acid , gretchen hagen <dig> , small auxin up rna , and auxin response factor   <cit> . it was subsequently found that these so-called early auxin-responsive genes are characterized by conserved promoter elements, including the tga element , core element of the auxin response region , and auxin response element   <cit> . being an important component of auxin signaling pathway, arfs activate or repress the expression of auxin response genes by binding to auxre in their promoter  <cit> .

a typical arf contains a highly conserved n-terminal b3-like dna binding domain  that recognizes auxre in the promoter of auxin-responsive genes  <cit> . the c-terminal dimerization domain  contains two motifs, called iii and iv, that are also found in aux/iaa and enable the formation of homo- and hetero-dimers among arfs and aux/iaas  <cit> . the middle region , located between dbd and ctd, confers transcriptional activation or repression depending on its amino acid composition  <cit> .

the functions of arfs are well studied. in arabidopsis thaliana, arf <dig> and arf <dig> loss-of-function mutations affect leaf senescence and floral organ abscission  <cit> . loss-of-function arf <dig> mutants display defects in gynoecium and floral meristem patterning  <cit> , while mutant arf <dig> is characterized by abnormal vascular strands and embryo axis  <cit> . atarf <dig> is involved in the conditional regulation of differential growth in aerial tissues, and a mutation in atarf <dig> impairs hypocotyl response to blue light and auxin stimuli  <cit> . atarf <dig> regulates hypocotyl elongation, auxin homeostasis, and fruit development  <cit> . furthermore, the flowers of arf6/arf <dig> double mutant are infertile closed buds with short petals, short stamen filaments, and undehisced anthers  <cit> . the double mutation, arf7/arf <dig> affects auxin mediated lateral root development  <cit> . in rice , transgenic plants that express an antisense osarf <dig> show extremely low growth, poor vigor, curled leaves, and sterility, suggesting that this gene is essential for vegetative and reproductive development  <cit> . previous studies have shown that osarf <dig>  a transcription factor regulating auxin redistribution, is required for iron and phosphate deficiency responses in rice . another auxin response factor, osarf <dig>  controls rice leaf angles through the positive regulation of osgh3– <dig> and osbri <dig>  <cit> . in tomato , recent studies have shown the involvement of slarf genes in flower development and fruit set, development, and ripening .

papaya  is an economically important fruit crop in tropical and subtropical countries  <cit> . sex type in this trioecious species is determined by a pair of sex chromosomes, and plants have either female , male , or hermaphrodite  flowers  <cit> . papaya often exhibits male and imperfect hermaphrodite flowers, which are influenced by environmental and hormonal factors . under high summer temperatures, the flowers have been observed to change from hermaphrodite to male because of ovary abortion and stamen carpelloid. some endohormones, such as auxin, may play important roles in this change process  <cit> . despite the various causes of malformation in papaya fruit, the pear-shaped fruits from hermaphrodite flowers are commercially preferred, and hermaphrodite papayas are favored worldwide for economic production  <cit> . papaya fruits are very susceptible to deterioration and postharvest losses mainly by fungal decay and physiological disorders such as chilling injury, pests, mechanical injury, and over-ripeness. therefore, there are several critical problems in breeding and cultivation of hermaphrodite plants that need to be solved  <cit> . auxin has a positive role in the quality maintenance and shelf life of harvested papaya fruits  <cit> . application of exogenous auxin can delay fruit ripening in many crop species  <cit> ; however, the underlying mechanism linking auxin signaling and reproduction of papaya is largely unknown.

as an important segment of the auxin-signaling pathway, arfs are encoded by a multi-gene family in many different plant species. there are  <dig> members in arabidopsis,  <dig> in tomato,  <dig> in maize ,  <dig> in cucumber ,  <dig> in poplar ,  <dig> in rice ,  <dig> in medicago ,  <dig> in sweet orange , and  <dig> in soybean  . in this study, we used the existing data in public databases to perform domain analysis and identify genes encoding arfs in papaya. we also aimed to reveal comprehensive information on the gene structure, protein motif architecture, and sequence homology of  <dig> cparfs.

analysis of phylogenetic relationships and gene structure
the phylogenetic distribution suggested that arfs could be grouped into four major subclasses, including ia, ib, ii, and iii . based on the phylogenetic tree, seven sister gene pairs were identified between arabidopsis and c. papaya: cparf2/atarf <dig>  cparf3/atarf <dig>  cparf4/atarf <dig>  cparf5/atarf <dig>  cparf10/atarf <dig>  cparf16/atarf <dig>  and cparf17/atarf <dig>  no sister gene pairs were found between c. papaya and rice. most cparfs contained three typical domains: dbd, domain ii, and aux/iaa family domain. cparf <dig>  cparf <dig>  cparf <dig>  and cparf <dig> contained dbd and domain ii, but no aux/iaa family domain . the exon-intron structure of each cparf was revealed by comparing the full-length cdna sequences with the corresponding genomic dna sequences. the number of introns in cparf genes ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> . cparf genes, even with close phylogenetic relationship, displayed complex distribution patterns of introns-exons.fig.  <dig> analysis of protein domains, gene structures, and phylogenesis. a phylogeny of auxin response factor  proteins between different species. eleven carica papaya arfs ,  <dig> arabidopsis thaliana arfs , and  <dig> oryza sativa arfs  are classified into three groups: i, ii, and iii. group i includes two subgroups: ia and ib. scale bar  <dig>  denotes  <dig>  amino-acid substitution per site. b schematic organization of cparfs. the arf domain, b <dig> dna binding domain , and auxin/indole-3-acetic acid  family domain are shown in red, yellow, and blue, respectively. c exon-intron structure analysis of cparf genes. exons are represented by blue boxes; introns are represented by gray lines



analysis of amino-acid composition and classification of cparfs
the  <dig> cparfs were classified into three groups based on their mr amino-acid composition and the presence or absence of ctds:  arfs with a dbd, activator mr and a ctd;  arf with a dbd, repressor mr and a ctd; and  arfs with a dbd, repressor mr, but no ctd . the domain position in these  <dig> cparfs is presented in additional file 3: table s <dig>  and the amino acid composition of mrs is shown in fig. 2b and additional file 4: table s <dig>  cparfs contained four putative transcriptional activators, cparf <dig>  seven, ten, and  <dig> , and three putative transcriptional repressors, cparf <dig>  four, and  <dig> . three cparfs  were putative transcriptional repressors that did not contain a ctd. only one cparf, cparf <dig>  contained only a dbd.fig.  <dig> analysis of amino acid content and classification of carica papaya auxin response factor  proteins. a the protein structure of cparfs. dbd, dna-binding domain; ctd, c-terminal dimerization domain; mr, middle region; rd, repression domain; ad, activation domain; q, glutamine; s, serine; l, leucine; p, proline; g, glycine. b amino-acid content of mr domains in putative cparfs. cparf is the x-axis variable and the corresponding amino acid content is the y-axis variable. colored bars represent different amino acids



expression patterns for cparf genes in different plant tissues
to study the physiological function of cparf genes, the spatial-specific expression pattern of the  <dig> cparf genes was detected in different tissues and organs, including shoots, leaves, flowers, fruits and roots. the expression of most cparf genes was ubiquitous in all studied tissues and organs, suggesting that they might have a putative function in many aspects of plant growth and development. some cparf genes  showed fruit-specific expression, which indicated that they might play a role in fruit ripening. cparf <dig> was highly expressed in flowers, while cparf <dig>  cparf <dig>  and cparf <dig> were highly expressed in roots. many cparf genes, including cparf <dig>  cparf <dig>  cparf <dig>  cparf <dig>  cparf <dig>  cparf <dig>  and cparf <dig>  were hardly detectable in leaves and shoots .fig.  <dig> tissue-specific expression patterns of carica papaya auxin response factor  genes. expression pattern of cparf genes in leaves, shoots, roots, flowers, and fruits of 2-year-old papaya plants. cpactin value is  <dig>  means are from five independent repeats; error bars show standard deviations



expression of cparf genes during flower developmental stages and fruit set
in our study, we focused on the expression pattern of cparf genes in flowers during eight different developmental stages. except for cparf <dig> that showed the lowest expression level in all flowering stages, the remaining cparf genes exhibited dynamic expression patterns. cparf <dig>  cparf <dig>  cparf <dig>  cparf <dig>  and cparf <dig> showed the peak expression in flower developmental stage one and decreased during the following developmental stages, while cparf <dig> increased during the developmental process and reached the peak at stage seven. in addition, the expression pattern of cparf genes that belonged to the same phylogenetic branch also varied significantly. the expression of cparf <dig> did not change significantly during the developmental process, while the expression of its sister pair gene, cparf <dig>  showed a clear decrease .fig.  <dig> heatmap of carica papaya auxin response factor  gene expression during different flower developmental stages. changes in the expression levels during different flower developmental stages that schematically depicted above the displayed quantitative real time  data are relative to rna accumulation levels. levels of down expression  or up expression  are shown on a log <dig> scale from the highest to the lowest expression of each cparf gene. significant  differences are indicated by an asterisk



tissue-specific expression analysis showed that some cparf genes were highly expressed in the reproductive organs . these results prompted us to investigate the expression of cparf genes during various fruit ripening stages. the data indicated that the expression of most cparf genes underwent a significant change associated with fruit ripening. the expression of cparf <dig> showed a significant increase during the fruit ripening stages; while the expression of cparf <dig> and cparf <dig> decreased from stage one to stage six .fig.  <dig> heatmap of carica papaya auxin response factor  gene expression during different fruit developmental stages. changes in the expression levels during different fruit developmental stages that schematically depicted above the displayed quantitative real time  data are relative to rna accumulation levels. levels of down expression  or up expression  are shown on a log <dig> scale from the highest to the lowest expression of each cparf gene. significant  differences are indicated by an asterisk



auxin regulation of cparf genes in the flower and fruit
the qrt-pcr data showed that most of cparf genes were responsive to iaa and tiba treatment.

in flowers, the expression of cparf <dig> was significantly down regulated by iaa treatment and up regulated by tiba treatment. cparf <dig> and cparf <dig> expression levels were significantly increased by iaa treatment and remained stable after tiba treatment. cparf <dig> showed no response to iaa treatment and was largely induced by tiba treatment. cparf <dig> also showed no response to iaa treatment and was significantly induced by tiba treatment. cparf <dig> showed opposite expression patterns between iaa treatment and tiba treatment. the expression of cparf <dig> was up regulated by iaa treatment and down regulated by tiba treatment .

in fruits, many cparf genes, such as cparf <dig>  cparf <dig>  cparf <dig>  cparf <dig>  cparf <dig>  and cparf <dig>  were significantly induced by tiba treatment. however, many cparf genes, including cparf <dig>  cparf <dig>  cparf <dig>  cparf <dig>  cparf <dig>  and cparf <dig>  were inhibited by iaa treatment .

expression of cparf genes involved in male-hermaphrodite differentiation
to understand the regulatory mechanisms of auxin signaling involved in sex determination, we analyzed the expression abundance of cparf genes in the three different sex types. most cparf genes showed higher expression abundance in male and hermaphrodite flowers than in female flowers. for example, cparf <dig>  cparf <dig>  cparf <dig>  cparf <dig>  and cparf <dig> showed the highest expression abundance  in male flowers. however, cparf <dig> showed the highest expression abundance in hermaphrodite flowers, while it was almost undetectable in male flowers .fig.  <dig> expression of carica papaya auxin response factor  genes in different flower sex types. three different sex type flowers were collected for qrt-pcr test. the green boxes indicated the expression abundance in male flowers; the blue boxes indicated the expression abundance in female flowers; the red boxes indicated the expression abundance in hermaphrodite flowers



analysis of auxres in the promoter of reproduction-related genes
after searching the papaya genome database, we selected seven floral meristem determinacy related homologous genes   <cit> , nine cpknox genes , four flower development-related homologous genes   <cit> , four ethylene-signaling-related homologous genes   <cit> , and three ethylene-synthesis-related homologous genes   <cit>  for this analysis. among the  <dig> selected gene promoters,  <dig> promoters contained one or more auxres  . therefore, it was suggested that some reproduction-related genes could be strongly regulated by auxin treatment. all the promoter sequences of reproduction-related genes were listed in additional file 11: table s <dig> fig.  <dig> analysis of cis-elements in flower and fruit development-related genes. the 1500 bp upstream from annotated start codons of  <dig> flower and fruit development-related genes were analyzed for the presence of auxres, which are given using the presented colour code. the red code indicated aux <dig>  and brown code indicated aux <dig> 



endogenous iaa measurement
to reveal the involvement of auxin in the development of flowers and fruits in papaya, endogenous iaa contents were measured. the data showed that the endogenous iaa contents were much lower in the flowers under later stages than in the flowers under early stages. in the fruits, the endogenous iaa contents keep on a high level from stage one to stage four, and then significantly declined in the stages five and six. furthermore, three different sex type flowers were collected for endogenous iaa measurements. the highest iaa contents were detected in the male flowers. the iaa contents in the female and hermaphrodite flowers were lower than that in the male flowers .

discussion
auxin is a key signaling molecule for most organogenesis and patterning processes occurring during plant development  <cit> . the auxin transduction pathway is mainly comprised of two transcriptional regulator families: arfs and aux/iaas  <cit> . arfs directly bind to down-stream target genes and regulate their expression during development  <cit> . arfs are also involved in the reproduction of various plant species  <cit> . characterization and analysis of cparfs allowed us to reveal the mechanisms behind auxin involvement in fruit and flower development of papaya  <cit> .

in this study, the reference genome sequence of papaya, which is relatively small in size   <cit> , was used to identify the complete cparf family. the number of cparf genes was less than that in arabidopsis   <cit> . protein domain analysis provided us useful information on the biological function of arfs. a typical arf contains a dbd, an mr, and a ctd  <cit> . aux/iaas bind to ctds of arfs and form heterodimers. the presence of a large number of cparfs without ctd suggested that some auxin-responsive genes in papaya can be regulated in an auxin independent manner  <cit> . the percentage of ctd-truncated cparfs  was higher than that in other plant species, such as soybean , arabidopsis , brassica rapa , rice , and tomato   <cit> . based on the amino acid composition of mr domains, cparfs were classified into two groups: transcriptional activators and repressors  <cit> . the average activator/repressor ratio of cparfs was  <dig>  , similar to arabidopsis  and rice , and almost double compared to that in tomato   <cit> . only one arf in papaya, cparf <dig>  contained only a dbd. these data provided insight into the potential functions of cparf genes in plant developmental regulation.

we also built a phylogenetic tree to analyze the relationship of arf families between papaya, arabidopsis, and rice. the results showed that seven sister gene pairs with high bootstrap values  were identified between papaya and arabidopsis, suggesting that arfs in papaya were highly homologous to those in arabidopsis . many atarfs have been already reported in previous reports ; therefore, comparative studies may reveal useful information on the respective biological functions in papaya.

in arabidopsis, transcription factors arf <dig> and arf <dig> regulate a complex process by promoting expansion, stamen filament elongation, anther dehiscence, and gynoecium maturation  <cit> . the expression of cparf <dig>  a homologous gene of atarf <dig> and atarf <dig>  was increased more than six folds from flower developmental stage  <dig> to stage  <dig> , indicating a putative function of this gene in flower development and maturation. the double mutant arf6/arf <dig> in arabidopsis delays the elongation of floral organs and subsequently delays the opening of flower buds and petal growth  <cit> . most defects in arf6/arf <dig> are attributed to the abnormal expression of class one knoxs  <cit> . the promoters of some knox genes in papaya, such as cpknox <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  contain several auxre elements, suggesting that these genes may be negatively regulated by cparf <dig> in the developing floral organs .

atarf <dig> was also reported to be involved in flower patterning  <cit> . cparf <dig>  showed high expression levels in the flowers . however, the expression of cparf <dig> gradually declined from flower developmental stage one to stage eight, suggesting that it might play a different role compared to cparf <dig> during flower development, especially at the initial stage. the arabidopsis mutant arf <dig> has a delayed flowering and ripening, while a double mutant arf1/arf <dig> has an enhanced arf <dig> phenotype, indicating that atarf <dig> acts in a partially redundant manner with atarf <dig>  <cit> . in papaya, cparf <dig>  was highly expressed in flowers, while cparf <dig>  showed a fruit-specific expression. furthermore, the expression level of cparf <dig> was much higher in female flowers than in male flowers, and cparf <dig> showed an opposite expression pattern to cparf <dig>  the expression level of cparf <dig> was eight-fold higher in male flowers than in female flowers . additionally, the expression of cparf <dig> and cparf <dig> also declined during flower development . the preferred expression in early stages suggested that cparf <dig> and cparf <dig> participated in flower bud formation, which is a key step for flower development. tir1/afb-mediated auxin-responsive gene expression is controlled by the interaction between aux/iaa repressors and arf transcription factors  <cit> . cparf <dig>  cparf <dig>  and cparf4-related auxin expression regulation was decreased, while cparf6-mediated auxin expression regulation was activated in the mature flowers.

fruit development is a complex interplay of cell division, differentiation, and expansion that occurs in a temporally and spatially coordinated manner in the reproductive organs  <cit> . auxin triggers and/or promotes the unpollinated, quiescent ovary to undergo cell division and elongation, and hence it is considered to play a major role in fruit set and development  <cit> . in tomato, slarfs are involved in the regulation of various aspects of fruit development  <cit> . slarf <dig> acts as a negative regulator of fruit set after pollination and fertilization, and moderates auxin response during fruit growth  <cit> . another tomato gene, slarf <dig>  an auxin response factor involved in the control of sugar metabolism during fruit development, expresses in pericarp tissues of immature fruit  <cit> . in papaya, several cparf genes, including cparf <dig>  cparf <dig>  cparf <dig>  cparf <dig>  cparf <dig>  and cparf <dig>  displayed fruit-specific expression patterns, suggesting their importance in improving fruit-related agronomic traits in papaya  <cit> . goetz et al. suggested that atarf <dig> restricts auxin signal transduction in ovules and pistil until the initiation of fruit development  <cit> . however, no homologous gene of atarf <dig> was identified in papaya.

it is well studied that reproductive organs of plants reacted differently to different plant hormones. many previous researches have presumed that auxin might play important roles in flower differentiation in papaya, and delay fruit ripening in other plant species  <cit> . however, there is still no decisive evidence revealing that endogenous iaa plays roles in the flower and fruit development in papaya. the endogenous iaa contents showed a decline during both the flower and fruit development, suggesting that a high level of endogenous iaa might contribute to the initiation of reproductive organs in papaya.

ethylene-auxin crosstalk regulates a variety of developmental and growth processes in plants, including fruit development and ripening . auxin plays a key role in progressing of fruit development towards the transition phase that leads to the initiation of autocatalytic ethylene production in an auxin- and ethylene-dependent manner . in arabidopsis, atarf <dig> and atarf <dig> are involved in ethylene response, indicating an interaction between auxin and ethylene  <cit> . slarf <dig>  a homolog of atarf <dig> in tomato, was also found to be involved in auxin signaling transduction during tomato fruit set and development  <cit> . in our study, the expression of cparf <dig>  was significantly inhibited during fruit ripening . high expression levels of cparf <dig> and cparf <dig> in mature flowers and early fruit developmental stages indicated that these two genes might be involved in fruit set and early cell division stage of the fruit. to get the putative targets for cparfs during fruit ripening, we analyzed the promoter regions of several ethylene-signaling-and ethylene-synthesis-related genes in papaya . the results showed that many auxres were contained in the promoters of two selected ethylene-signaling-related genes  and three ethylene-synthesis-related genes  . in papaya, arfs may be also involved in fruit ripening by regulating ethylene-signaling-related and ethylene-synthesis-related genes.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our study provided comprehensive information on arf family in papaya, including gene structures, chromosome locations, phylogenetic relationships, and expression patterns. the involvement of cparf gene expressions in flower and fruit development allowed us to understand the role of arf-mediated auxin signaling in the maturation of reproductive organs in papaya.
