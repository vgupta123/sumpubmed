BACKGROUND
the set of all rna molecules transcribed in an organ or tissue at a particular point of time under a given set of environmental conditions constitute the transcriptome. in contrast to the genome, which remains largely constant during the life of an individual, the transcriptome is highly dynamic. global patterns of gene expression vary greatly in space  as well as in time . the transcriptome is characterized by both qualitative features, such as a description of which genes are transcribed, as well as quantitative features including the level of expression of each gene. evaluating the transcriptome, i.e. estimating the level of expression of all genes under particular conditions, is a key step to understand the complex processes that occur during development.

rna-seq  <cit>  is a robust technology to obtain genome-wide estimates of relative gene expression. rna is purified from a sample of interest and converted to a cdna library which is sequenced using one of a variety of high-throughput sequencing methods. sequence fragments are then mapped to a reference genome and the frequency of these alignments is used to estimate the expression of each gene  <cit> . when a published reference genome is not available, the cdna reads can be assembled de novo in order to obtain a high quality reference to which the reads can be re-mapped  <cit> . rna-seq experiments demand a careful design including replicates that permit the estimation of statistical error or variation that is not explained by the experimental treatment  <cit> .

one of the challenges of high-throughput experiments is the analysis of very large datasets in order to extract biologically pertinent knowledge  <cit> . conclusions drawn from the expression of a single gene or a small set of related genes may lead to an incomplete understanding of particular phenomena. a current trend in developmental biology research is to interpret changes in gene expression in the context of simultaneous changes in the resulting proteome and the set of metabolites present during each state of development  <cit> . as mentioned in  <cit> , “simply comparing genes to themselves have the pitfall of taking molecular information out of context. numerous scientists have emphasized the need for better context. this can be achieved through holistic measurements of differential connectivity in addition to, or in replacement, of differential expression”. here we propose to achieve a better understanding of the dynamic changes of the transcriptome by examining the weighted expression of groups of genes related with specific biological processes or metabolic pathways. in addition, we examine the changes in the diversity and specialization of the transcriptome. these analyses create an interpretation framework for the results, which makes it easier to appreciate their meaning.

chili pepper  is one of the most important horticultural vegetable crops worldwide as well as a good model for the study of secondary metabolism during fruit development. capsicum species  are members of the solanaceae family, which also includes other important crops such as tomato , potato , tobacco , eggplant , and ornamentals like petunia . chili pepper fruits synthesize and accumulate a number of valuable compounds including capsaicinoids , pigments such as anthocyanins and carotenoids as well as vitamins a, b and c  <cit> . because of the agricultural importance of chili peppers, efforts have been made to study the transcriptome of capsicum species as a source of basic and applied knowledge. for example, a chili pepper  est database built from  <dig>  sequenced ests and  <dig>  refined ests from  <dig> cdna libraries representing  <dig> different tissues, developmental stages or plants subjected to different stress conditions has been reported  <cit>  and specific efforts have been made to identify genes involved in the biosynthesis of capsaicinoids  <cit> . a transcriptome profile of red chili pepper fruits  was obtained using  <dig> gs-flx pyrosequencing and  <dig>  total unigenes were assembled. in this assembly, 30% of aligned reads were assigned to a locus with a specific function annotation, 24% of alignments matched to genes of unknown or unclassified function and 46% could not be aligned to an individual gene. furthermore,  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphisms  and  <dig> simple sequence repeats  were detected that will be useful as molecular markers for linkage mapping and association mapping  <cit> . assemblies of two chili pepper transcriptomes from sequences generated by sanger sequencing  or the illumina ngs platform  were carried out to identify snps and ssrs as molecular markers useful for breeding or single position polymorphisms  for genotyping  <cit> . recently, we described a capsicum transcriptome database generated from a hybrid assembly of a collection of ests derived from five capsicum annuum organs  sequenced by the sanger method and from multiple leaf transcriptomes obtained by pyrosequencing. this project yielded almost  <dig>  singletons and  <dig>  high quality contigs   <cit> . transcriptomic studies of chili pepper plants subjected to different stresses have also been reported. for example,  <dig>  ests were generated and a cdna microarray analysis identified  <dig> chili pepper genes responsive to the non-host soybean pustule pathogen xanthomonas axonopodis pv. glycines <cit> . cdna microarrays were used to study the expression of ozone stress-regulated genes in a sensitive  and a resistant chili pepper cultivar   <cit> . transcriptomic analysis of leaves following infection of chili pepper plants with a geminivirus revealed a total of  <dig> differentially expressed genes between healthy  and symptomatic or recovered tissues  <cit> . more recently, a global transcriptomic analysis of chili pepper plants treated with different biotic/abiotic stresses was carried out to investigate the participation of signaling components  in both types of stresses. this study targeted the involvement of salicylic acid in the activation of abiotic stress-responsive genes, methyl jasmonate and ethylene in regulating biotic stress-responsive genes, and abscisic acid in regulating both biotic and abiotic stress-responsive genes  <cit> .

here we present an analysis of the changes in the transcriptome during the development and ripening of chili pepper fruit. we quantified the expression of  <dig>  chili genes at each of four time points sampled. considering these transcriptomes at a more global level, we also evaluated their diversity and specialization, as well as the specificity of the genes expressed during chili fruit development. in addition, by categorizing genes into biological process ontologies as well as kegg metabolic pathways in which they participate, we analyzed the behavior of groups of genes involved in these categories. finally, our rna-seq expression data was validated by analyzing the expression of genes involved in carotenoid biosynthesis by qrt-pcr.

RESULTS
the transcriptome of chili pepper fruit
the transcriptional dynamics of a serrano type chili pepper cultivar  were studied at four stages of fruit development:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days after anthesis . representative photographs of chili pepper fruits at different stages of development, including the time points selected for this work, are presented in figure  <dig>  these particular developmental stages were selected because  <dig> and  <dig> daa are early and intermediate stages of fruit development, respectively. at  <dig> daa, chili fruits reach their maximum size and represent the breaking stage of ripening . finally,  <dig> daa is the point at which the fruits are fully ripe  <cit> . at each time point, mrna was purified and cdna libraries created from two independent samplings of whole fruits. these eight libraries were sequenced using the illumina miseq platform, yielding a total of  <dig> , <dig> raw reads, that after quality filtering resulted into  <dig> , <dig> reads of  <dig> bp in length, a total of  <dig>  mb of data. reads were trimmed of adaptor sequences and ambiguous bases, then assembled de novo into a transcriptome reference using trinity software  <cit> . this assembly consisted of  <dig>  contigs with a mean length of  <dig>  bp. the cdna reads were re-mapped to the trinity contigs using bowtie software  <cit>  and  <dig>  contigs had at least one read aligned, indicating that this subset of contigs in the de novo assembly represents genes expressed in our chili pepper samples. the contigs were subjected to blast analysis against different databases. contigs with identical blast hit were considered as variants  of the same gene and thus grouped into a single unit for analyses. we obtained evidence for the expression of  <dig>  chili genes and 52% of these genes had enough similarity to sequences in databases to provide some annotation .

estimation of the number of expressed genes and scaled number of mrna molecules
one difficulty in rna-seq transcriptome research is that certain genes can be expressed at such low levels that the total number of cdna sequences obtained  can be insufficient to detect them  <cit> . this problem is similar to one well-known in ecology research when sampling species at a given site; sampling can miss some rare species depending on the sample size  <cit> . nonetheless, from the frequencies of expression found in a given sample, it is possible to estimate the total number of genes that are actually expressed in a transcriptome, even if their expression was not detected in the particular sample. we used two such estimators, one originally proposed by chao et al. for ecological research  <cit>  and another proposed by changjiang et al. in the context of gene estimation  <cit> . an additional parameter of interest is the scaled number of mrna molecules present in the samples, denoted here by m and called “rna production” in  <cit> . comparing the number of reads obtained in a library with the estimated value of m, shows how close was the sampling deepness to the scaled number of mrna molecules existent under each stage of development. to calculate the scaled number of mrna molecules we used the estimator for m proposed by good  <cit>  in the ecological context. table  <dig> presents the total number of sequences obtained in the sampling of the transcriptomes as well as estimations for the number of genes expressed in each transcriptome and the scaled number of mrna molecules present in each sample, m^.

the number of cdna reads obtained in our sampling of chili transcriptomes at each stage of development was approximately two million for each sampling point , with a minimum of approximately  <dig>  million and a maximum of approximately  <dig>  million . these figures are the sum of the number of reads derived from the two biological replicates at each stage. table  <dig> also indicates the number of genes showing evidence of expression at each stage of development.

the number of genes for which we obtained evidence of expression at each stage of development ranged from a minimum of  <dig>  genes at  <dig> daa to  <dig>  genes at  <dig> daa. the total number of genes whose expression was detected in at least one of the samples was  <dig> . this figure likely overestimates the true number of expressed genes because our de novo transcriptome assembly strategy results in isoforms or alleles of transcripts expressed from the same locus that are assembled into distinct contigs. derived estimates of the true number of genes expressed in each one of the stages of development using chao’s estimator  had a mean of  <dig>  with standard deviation of  <dig> . from this we concluded that our sampling depth was insufficient to detect the expression of approximately  <dig>  genes, which likely have frequencies of expression lower than  <dig>  transcripts per million , and thus were not detected in our data. estimates of the number of expressed genes obtained with the estimator proposed by changjiang et al. resulted in a larger number of genes whose expression was not detected . it is not clear which of the two estimators is more accurate, but our own simulation studies suggest that the changjiang et al. estimator tends to overestimate the number of undetected genes . the true number of expressed genes is therefore likely to be closer to the number obtained by using chao’s estimator. considering that the arabidopsis genome encodes approximately  <dig>  protein coding genes  <cit> , and tomato and potato  have  <dig>  and  <dig>  protein-coding genes supported by rna sequencing respectively  <cit> , we can infer that in this study we detected a large proportion of the genes expressed in the chili fruit transcriptome. the last column of table  <dig>  m^, indicates estimates of the scaled number of mrna molecules present at each stage of development, obtained by using good’s estimator  <cit> . the estimated values of m^ are very close to the number of reads obtained in the corresponding stages of development . in all cases the number of cdna reads obtained represents more than 99% of the estimated m^, indicating that the sample sizes employed in this study are close to the scaled number of mrna molecules at each stage of development. therefore, only genes transcribed at very low frequencies, likely less than  <dig>  tpm, were possibly missed by the sampling.

genes detected per subset
venn diagrams showing the intersections between expressed genes detected at each developmental stage  are shown in figure  <dig>   <dig>  genes, or  <dig> % of the total of  <dig>  genes detected, were expressed in all four stages of development.  <dig>   genes were expressed exclusively at a single stage of development. of these uniquely expressed genes,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   genes were expressed exclusively at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> daa, respectively. the ratio of genes expressed exclusively at a single stage to that of genes expressed in all stages,  <dig> / <dig>  or  <dig> , indicates that significant changes in expression happen during the development of chili pepper fruit, during which a large proportion of genes are switched on or off. the number of genes whose expression was detected at exactly two stages decreased as a function of time. for example, the number of genes whose expression was detected only during the  <dig> and  <dig> daa stages was  <dig>  , while the number detected only at  <dig> and  <dig> daa was  <dig> .  <dig>  of genes were expressed only at  <dig> and  <dig> daa.

changes in gene expression during fruit development and ripening
our chili pepper fruit transcriptomes were obtained at consecutive developmental time points . in our study, we measured changes in gene expression between consecutive time points, specifically between  <dig> to  <dig>   <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig> daa. we call these changes in patterns of gene expression “transitions”. change in gene expression in a transition are evaluated by the change in the number of reads detected for a given gene in the corresponding time points. in each transition we determined whether the expression level of each chili gene either decreased , remained steady  or increased . considering these three possibilities, expression of each gene was classified into 3×3×3= <dig> patterns, 1−ddd,2−dds,⋯,27−iii, where the order of the letters corresponds to the transition. for example, pattern 8−dis indicates a decrease in expression between  <dig> and  <dig> daa followed by an increase in the interval between  <dig> and  <dig> daa and an steady state between  <dig> and  <dig> daa. to classify each gene into one of the  <dig> possible patterns we used the r statistical software environment  <cit>  to implement the exact test for differences between two groups of negative-binomial counts proposed in  <cit>  and in  <cit> . the resulting probabilities were further processed using the q value procedure  <cit>  at a false discovery rate of 1% . details pertaining to the number of genes that were categorized into each one of the  <dig> possible patterns are presented in table  <dig> 

patterns of expression are denoted by a decrease, d, steady state, s, or increase, i, in each one of the three consecutive intervals,  <dig> to  <dig>   <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig> daa, respectively. all analyses were performed at  <dig>  fdr. for the  <dig> possible patterns, data for individual genes , biological processes  and metabolic pathways  are presented; in each case the number and percentage of the item following each pattern are presented.

the most common pattern of expression was represented by  <dig>  genes  that exhibited a consistent steady state mode of expression. in other words, these genes did not exhibit a significant change in expression between any of the consecutive time points . the remaining  <dig>  genes  exhibited a significant change in expression during at least one transition. the second- and third-most common patterns correspond to 13−ssd, represented by  <dig>  genes  and 15−ssi by  <dig>  genes, respectively. of particular interest, these two patterns represented by a total of  <dig>   genes, were populated by genes showing significant changes in expression only in the third transition. this result suggests that the developmental period between  <dig> and  <dig> daa was the most dynamic with respect to changes in the transcriptome. the fourth- and fifth-most common patterns were 5−dss, represented by  <dig> genes  and 23−iss, represented by  <dig>  genes, respectively. patterns 5−dss and 23−iss were also characterized by genes showing significant changes of expression in only one transition, but in these cases, the relevant developmental period was between  <dig> and  <dig> daa. taken together, our results indicate that relatively large groups of chili genes showed the tendency to change their level of expression at only a single developmental stage and remain at this level until fruit maturity. the number of genes participating in patterns 13−ssd,15−ssi,5−dss and 23−iss includes a total of  <dig>  genes , which is more than half of the number of genes that exhibited a significant change in expression during at least one transition . in contrast, consider the patterns populated by genes whose expression changed significantly only in the middle transition . examples of these patterns include 11−sds, represented by  <dig> genes  and 17−sis, represented by  <dig> genes . these patterns were relatively infrequent and populated by a total of  <dig> genes . patterns of consistent gene expression decrease  or increase  in each subsequent developmental interval were characterized by relatively few genes,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the least common pattern of gene expression observed was characterized by genes whose expression decreased in the first two transitions but increased in the third  genes). additional file  <dig> includes gene identifiers, description, expression level, pattern and q values for all genes detected in this study.

we also analyzed the global changes in gene expression during chili development by calculating the transition probabilities from one interval to the next. we begin by estimating the frequency of each transition during the first interval from  <dig> to  <dig> daa . then we calculated the conditional probabilities of change of state  from one transition to the next, assuming that a gene was selected at random. this allows the interpretation of the dynamic changes occurring during the transitions. for example, if a gene decreased its expression  during the interval  <dig> to  <dig> daa, the most likely event is that its expression would remain at steady state s during the interval  <dig> to  <dig> daa, and this probability was estimated to be  <dig> . all transition probabilities for genes whose expression were detected at a steady state level and then changed to a more active state,  were larger for the transitions from  <dig> -  <dig> daa to  <dig> -  <dig> daa than from  <dig> -  <dig> daa to  <dig> -  <dig> daa. for example, the probability of changing from s to d was  <dig>  during the transition from  <dig> -  <dig> daa to  <dig> -  <dig> daa, but was four times more likely  during the transition from  <dig> -  <dig> daa to  <dig> -  <dig> daa. this result suggests that the most active period for changes in expression frequencies occurred during the last period sampled, from  <dig> to  <dig> daa.

the number of genes exhibiting significant changes in expression during each interval of time is shown in figure  <dig>  the interval with the greatest number of genes showing significant changes in expression was between  <dig> and  <dig> daa, with  <dig> + <dig> = <dig>  changes, almost 50% of the total of significant changes detected in the three intervals . of these changes,  <dig>   were increases in expression and  <dig>   were decreases in expression, indicating that a larger percentage of genes were down-regulated during the last state of fruit development. in the first period, from  <dig> to  <dig> daa,  <dig>  significant changes were detected.  <dig>   genes were up-regulated and  <dig>  genes  were down-regulated, while in the second interval  a smaller number of significant changes  were observed. during the second interval,  <dig>  genes  were up-regulated and  <dig> genes  were down-regulated. in summary, development of the chili pepper fruit is characterized by two periods, from  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig> daa, where approximately  <dig>  genes per period changed their pattern of expression. this was followed by a dynamic period  where more than  <dig>  genes changed their expression pattern, and approximately 5/ <dig> of these changes were decreases in expression. this may indicate a global down-regulation of metabolism marking the end of the maturation process. however, it should also be noted that the intervals between sampling points were not all equal in duration. considering the global transcriptional changes on a per day basis, the first and third intervals appeared equally dynamic, exhibiting  <dig> /10= <dig> and  <dig> /20= <dig> changes in gene expression per day. during the intermediate period, between  <dig> to  <dig> daa, only  <dig> /20= <dig> changes in gene expression per day were observed.

we examined the expression patterns of genes encoding members of the xyloglucan transglucosylase/hydrolases  family as examples of genes known to participate in fruit development and ripening. genes belonging to the xths family where identified in our dataset using the results of the blast analysis. this family of enzymes is involved in xyloglucan endotransglucosylation and endohydrolysis and their respective genes are differentially expressed in mature-green and ripe tomato fruits  <cit> . the expression of the  <dig> members of the xths family exhibited the 7−did pattern and a peak of expression at  <dig> daa. however, the expression levels of individual members of this family was heterogeneous .

classifying the patterns of expression of genes during chili pepper fruit development and ripening in the discrete space of  <dig> possible patterns allows for a more detailed analysis of the complex changes in the transcriptome. by considering only the significant differences in expression between sampling points, we can filter some of the noise produced by random differences in expression between biological replicates as well as excluding genes with very low expression in all states of development. on the other hand, pattern classification offers a complementary method to peruse the data, by focusing on genes that share the same patterns of expression. for example, within the subset of genes showing a continuous decrease in expression during development  are a number of orthologs of the argonaute family. argonaute proteins form an evolutionarily conserved family whose members silence gene expression in pathways such as rna interference   <cit> . this suggests that the activity of the rna-induced silencing complex  decreases during fruit development. within the subset of genes whose expression increased in every subsequent developmental interval , we identified a senescence-associated gene, the chili pepper ortholog to arabidopsis, “at4g <dig>  senescence-associated gene 21”. the previous example of the xth family also shows that examining the expression of related genes can lead to a better understanding of the underlying genetic and metabolic processes. an additional interesting avenue is to study the promoters of genes that share the same pattern of expression, with the aim of identifying specific sequence motifs involved in regulating genes according to these specific patterns  <cit> . this goal may be attainable when a chili pepper genome sequence becomes available.

changes in diversity and specialization of the transcriptome
to further examine the global changes in gene expression during chili fruit development, we estimated the diversity and specialization of our transcriptomes as well as the specificity of the genes detected  <cit> . the diversity of the transcriptome, h, is measured by the application of shannon’s entropy formula to the set of estimated relative frequencies of expression of the genes. h is sensitive to both the number of expressed genes as well as to their frequencies, yielding higher values when the distribution of the frequencies is flatter. this scenario indicates that a larger content of information is passed from the nucleus to the protein synthesis machinery. we also estimated the specificity of each one of the genes. the specificity is zero if the corresponding gene is equally expressed in all the transcriptomes studied, and reach a maximum value when it is expressed exclusively at a single transcriptome . having the estimates of specificity for the genes we can estimate the specialization of the transcriptome, δ, as the weighted average of the specificity of the genes corresponding to that transcriptome. a larger value of δ indicates that, on average, more genes specific to the evaluated transcriptome are being expressed, i.e., the transcriptome is more “specialized” given that it express more specific genes. figure  <dig> presents a plot for the diversity  and specialization  of the transcriptomes we obtained during the development and ripening of chili pepper fruit. this figure also includes the number of significant changes in gene expression observed in each interval, discussed above. the diversity of the transcriptome increased from  <dig> daa  to  <dig> daa where it reaches its maximum value of h= <dig> . diversity then decreased abruptly in the interval from  <dig> to  <dig> daa to its minimum value of h= <dig> . interestingly, there was no appreciable change of slope in the diversity increases between  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig> daa, indicating that the rate of increase in transcriptome diversity was constant from  <dig> to  <dig> daa. this indicates that the point where genes were expressed at the most even frequencies was reached around  <dig> daa, and, from that point of development, the transcriptome changed to a distribution in which genes were expressed at more variable frequencies . another way to interpret the diversity of the transcriptome is to calculate the number of effective genes, g=2h. this parameter represents the number of genes equally expressed required to produce a given diversity value of h. in contrast to h, which is given in logarithmic scale,  is given in additive genetic units and is thus easier to interpret. the estimated values of  were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> daa, respectively. if the maximum value of g= <dig>  at  <dig> daa is considered as 100%, the percentage-transformed values of  were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 73% for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> daa respectively. this calculation makes it apparent that the  value diminished by 27% from  <dig> to  <dig> daa. this abrupt change in the number of effective expressed genes indicates that the last developmental period examined  was the one characterized by the most profound changes in the transcriptome. this claim is equally supported by considering the number of genes differentially expressed during each transition , while in intervals  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig> daa we see a more even ratio of around 50% in significant increases over the total of changes, /= <dig> / <dig> ≈ <dig> , this ratio descends to  <dig> /≈ <dig>  in the last interval from  <dig> to  <dig> daa, indicating a stronger down-regulation of the transcription machinery which results in a less diverse transcriptome at  <dig> daa.

the specialization of the transcriptome, , only slightly decreased at  <dig> daa compared to  <dig> daa, but at later time points it increased until reaching its maximum value at  <dig> daa. this indicates that the transcriptome at  <dig> daa was, on average, expressing more genes specific to that stage of development than at the other developmental time points. in contrast with the values for the number of genes detected at each time point , the specialization of the transcriptome gives a quantitative measure which responds to slight changes in the relative expression of the genes, allowing a better understanding of the global change experienced by these parameters.

considering together the results for h and δ presented in figure  <dig>  we conclude that the chili transcriptome was most specialized and least diverse at  <dig> daa and that the largest changes in the fruit transcriptome occurred in the period from  <dig> to  <dig> daa. to provide some context for these observations, the human organs producing the least diverse and most specialized transcriptomes are the pancreas, salivary glands and stomach, whose functional role is to produce a relatively small number of metabolites in large quantities  <cit> . according to our analyses, mature chili fruits at  <dig> daa are similar in that the transcriptome at this stage is less diverse and more specialized than the preceding developmental stages. this implies that more specific transcripts were produced in larger quantities than at the other stages sampled.

figure af1- <dig> in additional file  <dig> presents the distribution of the gene specificity values  <cit>  estimated in this study. in general, we observed a large proportion  of generalist genes which were expressed in all four stages at approximately the same level, and a large proportion  of highly specific genes that were almost exclusively expressed in only one of the stages of development. combining the gene specificity parameters with information pertaining to differential expression of genes during each of the three periods of development represents a powerful tool to further investigate the biological roles of genes of interest.

grouping genes to gain biological knowledge
grouping genes into categories has significant advantages to summarize gene expression information in extremely large datasets  <cit> . this approach reduces the dimensionality of the problem; instead of interpreting the expression patterns of thousands of genes, discrete groups of genes can be categorized in a variety of ways. this approach also increases statistical power, given that larger numbers of rna-seq reads can be taken into account in each comparison  <cit> . models that explain transcriptional regulatory networks are an achievable goal, and the one developed for e. coli <cit>  is a good example. eventually, we aim to develop models for eukaryotes that can explain and predict gene expression in different tissues and organs as a function of external and internal signals. by classifying patterns of gene expression into a smaller number of quantitative categories, it is possible to examine the tendencies of related groups of genes to coordinately change their levels of expression. there are currently a plethora of methods to analyze the expression of groups of genes . in our study, we made use of a relatively simple measurement. by adding together all rna-seq reads mapping to genes participating in a particular category of interest, we obtained a quantitative parameter describing the expression of the category as a whole. this approach implies the reductionistic assumption that a category pattern of expression can be accurately represented as the sum of its parts. this is clearly not the case in categories characterized by genes in which some must be up-regulated and some must be down-regulated in order to participate in a particular biological activity. more sophisticated alternatives of analyzing genes in categories imply a better understanding of the function of each gene participating in a category. for example, certain transcription factors may be activated and a distinct set repressed. thus, our approach of evaluating the sum of expression of genes participating in a category of interest is a crude, but necessary, first step in interpreting our expression results. this approach needs to be complemented with additional studies of the expression levels and functions associated with individual genes participating in each category.

in our study, we categorized chili pepper genes with sufficient annotation information into the biological process   terms and also into the metabolic pathways  in which they participate. the latter classification scheme made use of the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes   <cit> . for every chili gene that could be identified as an arabidopsis ortholog, its corresponding bp term or mp was recorded. these classification schemes are somewhat redundant in that a single gene may participate in more than one bp or mp. to address this issue, we divided the estimated expression values  between the number of categories in which the gene has been annotated to participate and used this normalization for the grouping analysis. thus, the total number of rna-seq reads considered for all genes was not altered, preserving the statistical power of the analysis . genes lacking sufficient annotation to participate in any of the bp or mp categories formed an “offset” category which was not tested but was included in the dataset. even when the literature for the analysis of gene groups is very abundant , to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that our particular approach to take into account the redundancy of the categories is reported.

genes grouped by biological process 
in the bp category analysis, a total of  <dig>  chili pepper genes were classified into  <dig> bp categories using the “slim” go term . the number and percentage of bp categories participating in each one of the  <dig> previously described global patterns of expression is presented in table  <dig>  interestingly, the number of genes exhibiting a particular pattern of expression was highly correlated with the number of bps showing the same pattern ρ^= <dig>  ; this suggest that not much relevant information was lost as a result of the grouping process and that the summarizing grouping procedure reflects the global behavior of gene expression. the most common pattern of expression for bp categories as well as for individual genes was 14−sss. this pattern denotes genes whose expression did not change significantly over the sampling periods. the 14−sss pattern includes  <dig> bp categories, which was  <dig> % of the total. expression patterns showing change only from  <dig> to  <dig> daa  comprised  <dig>  and  <dig> % of all bp categories, respectively. examples of bp categories showing the 13−ssd pattern  were histone methylation, determination of bilateral symmetry, secondary metabolic process, meristem initiation, pyrimidine ribonucleotide biosynthetic process and meiosis. the 15−ssi pattern  included bp categories such as riboflavin biosynthesis, defense response to fungus incompatible interaction, cellular lipid metabolic process and circadian rhythm. translational elongation was the sole bp category characterized by the 1−ddd pattern . nine bp categories exhibited the 27−iii pattern, which is an increase in expression during each subsequent interval. these nine bp ontologies were intracellular signal transduction, amino acid transport, dna-dependent negative regulation of transcription, cellular membrane fusion, response to abscisic acid stimulus, response to ethylene stimulus, negative regulation of endopeptidase activity, regulation of proteolysis and translational initiation. a table including results for each of the bp ontologies involved in our study is found in additional file  <dig> 

histograms indicating the number of significant changes in bps during each one of the developmental intervals are presented in figure  <dig>  from the total of  <dig> significant changes in the patterns of expression of the  <dig> bps, the largest number of changes  occurred in the last interval, from  <dig> to  <dig> daa. this result is consistent with our analysis of individual genes, which also showed that the greatest number of genes was differentially expressed from  <dig> to  <dig> daa . within these  <dig> changes in the behavior of the bp categories, a larger proportion was due to increases in expression  than to decreases . this pattern is in contrast to the behavior of individual genes, where a larger proportion of genes showed decreases in expression in the last period. this implies that although a larger proportion of genes were down-regulated in the last period, a larger number of bps were up-regulated or at least increased their net expression during this period of development. this inference is not complete because not all genes detected in the experiment could be categorized into bp ontologies. the number of significant changes in the net expression of bps during the first two intervals  was consistent with the expression results obtained for individual genes . in the first period a larger number of bps decreased their net expression  while this pattern was reversed in the second period in which more bps  increased their expression in comparison with the ones that decreased it . consistent with our analysis of individual genes, the net changes in expression of genes participating in the bp categories indicates that the most active period of change in the transcriptome occurred during the last interval . however, because the length of the first interval was  <dig> days and the lengths of the other two intervals were  <dig> days, the rates of change in net expression of genes included in the bp ontologies were 264/10= <dig> ,198/20= <dig>  and 445/20= <dig>  per day for the intervals from  <dig> to  <dig>   <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig> daa respectively. this result is also consistent with the rates of change in expression obtained for individual genes .

figure af1- <dig> in additional file  <dig> shows the expression of genes grouped into fruit maturation bp as well as the expression of the grouped genes. even when the analysis of the grouped expression shows a pattern of non significant changes , the pattern of all four genes forming this group shows a significant change in some of the intervals. in particular, the most influencing gene of the four , the chili pepper orthologous of arabidopsis at1g <dig>  a mate efflux family protein with functions in ripening, increases its expression significantly in the last two intervals, from  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig> daa. the fact that the grouped expression presents a pattern of non significant changes in this case is due to the changes in opposite directions from the genes forming the group. this illustrates the fact that it is important to examine not only the expression pattern of the group, but also of its individual components.

figure af1- <dig> in additional file  <dig> shows the expression of  <dig> genes grouped into developmental growth bp as well as the expression of the group as a whole. the pattern of change of this bp was significant at the three intervals, increasing in the first and decreasing in the following two intervals . the pattern 19−idd of developmental growth is consistent with what is known about the development of the chili pepper fruit, where the most active period of development occurs between  <dig> and  <dig> daa to then decrease up to the fully mature state at  <dig> daa . in this case the graph of the individual behavior of the  <dig> individual genes grouped into developmental growth bp is too complex to be directly interpreted. this shows the advantage of summarizing the expression of genes as groups.

genes grouped by metabolic pathway 
chili pepper genes  were grouped into  <dig> metabolic pathways  according to the classification of their corresponding arabidopsis orthologs . as for the bp ontologies, net changes in the expression of mps were evaluated by summing the weighted expression of genes participating in each mp. the  <dig> possible patterns of change for the net expression of mp categories are shown in table  <dig>  the correlation between the patterns presented by genes considered individually and mp was estimated to be ρ^= <dig>   whereas the correlation between the patterns observed for bp and mp was estimated to be ρ^= <dig>  . these measures indicate that there was greater concordance between the patterns presented by genes grouped into mp categories with genes grouped into bp categories than between genes grouped into mp categories with individual genes. as was previously observed for individual genes and genes grouped by bp, the most common pattern exhibited by genes grouped by mp was 14−sss.  <dig>  mp categories showed a steady-state level of net expression during chili development. as was the case for individual genes and bp categories, the next-most frequent patterns of change in the expression of mp categories were those exhibiting significant differences only in the third interval: 13−ssd with  <dig>  mps and 15−ssi with  <dig>  mps. these two patterns were populated by a total of  <dig>  mps, reaffirming the fact that the third interval  had the most profound transcriptional changes in our samples of chili pepper development. full results pertaining to our pattern analyses of mp categories during chili development are shown in additional file  <dig>  a total of  <dig>  of the mps included in our study showed a significant change in net expression in at least one of the three intervals studied . only  <dig> mps  exhibited the pattern of significant decrease in each subsequent interval , while three mps  exhibited the pattern of significant increase in net expression in each subsequent interval . this result suggests a crucial role for these metabolic processes during chili development and ripening, however, a recent metabolomic study of capsicum <cit>  reports non significant changes in tyrosine during ripening while tryptophan was not detected, possibly by methodological shortcomings. on the other hand, the continuous increase in the expression of genes related with the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis during development could be related to the lignification of the fruit and also to the synthesis of capsaicinoids, as has been reported  <cit> .

as previously discussed, these patterns observed of the mp categories reflect the weighted sum of rna-seq reads mapping to genes participating in the mps. a more complete understanding of metabolic pathways playing important roles during chili development will require a careful analysis of the behavior of individual genes comprising the mp categories. the number of significant changes in the net expression of mps during the three developmental intervals is summarized in figure  <dig>  the third interval  had the greatest number of significant changes in the net expression of mps. during this interval, we calculated a total of  <dig>  significant changes in mps, with  <dig>  showing increased and  <dig>  showing decreased expression. this result is in accordance with our analysis of the expression of individual genes. the third period of development  had the greatest number of differentially expressed genes, most of which were down-regulated during this interval. also, the tendencies observed in the analyses of individual genes during the first two intervals, from  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig> daa  were confirmed by the analyses performed by mp and presented in figure  <dig>  we found  mps down-regulated in the first interval compared with  up-regulated mps, while this tendency was reversed in the second interval where  <dig> mps  were down-regulated compared with  <dig>  up-regulated. these observations could be due to the fact that the first period  occurs during the transition from flower to fruit, while in the second interval  new mp are activated. in the last period of maturation , metabolic activity decreases and thus a large number of mps are down-regulated. considering the four developmental time points together,  <dig>  mps were up-regulated and  <dig>  were down-regulated. similar to our calculations for the rate of change in the numbers of differentially expressed genes, the rate of change per day in mp expression was 64/10= <dig> ,47/20= <dig>  and 104/20= <dig>  changes per day for the intervals between  <dig> to  <dig>   <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig> daa, respectively.

the expression patterns of genes associated with the capsaicinoid and ascorbic acid biosynthesis mp categories are shown in additional file 1: figures af1- <dig> and af1- <dig>  respectively. gene expression estimates for each gene participating in these categories are shown in additional file 1: tables af1- <dig> and af1- <dig>  respectively. for the capsaicinoid biosynthesis pathway, the net expression pattern of the grouped genes participating in this pathway was 19−idd, with a peak at  <dig> daa. six of the  <dig> individual genes grouped into this pathway also exhibited this pattern. this result is in agreement with previous studies of capsaicinoid accumulation in ‘tampiqueño 74’ chili pepper fruits  <cit> . these pungent compounds begin to accumulate at  <dig> daa, reach their maximum levels at  <dig> daa and then decay  <cit> . with the aim of identifying genes involved in the biosynthesis of capsaicinoids liu et al. performed an rna-seq study contrasting the placenta and pericarp of a highly pungent cultivar of c. frutescens l.  <cit> . fruits were collected in the period of  <dig> to  <dig> daa and hundreds of genes potentially regulating capsaicinoid biosynthesis were identified, which were predicted to be involved in microbody, peroxisome, fatty acid synthase activity, coa-ligase activity, acyltransferase activity, transaminase activity, and phenylalanine metabolism, among other processes. in our study we varied the time period  studying whole fruits, and we identified groups of genes differentially expressed in time with peroxisome localization  as well as genes involved in protein import into the peroxisome matrix . in general, these genes tend to increase their expression as a function of time. in addition, genes involved in phenylalanine metabolism and coa metabolism as well as acyltransferase or transaminase activities were found to be differentially expressed during chili development . two genes recently shown to be involved in the capsaicinoids biosynthetic pathway, dhad  and td   <cit> , were identified in our study. dhad presented the expression pattern 13−ssd, while td presented the pattern 1−ddd. a comparison of the results by liu et al. for different parts of the fruit with the data reported here for changes in transcription activity trough time in the whole fruit provides a better understanding of the dynamics of the transcriptome during fruit development.

genes categorized into the ascorbic acid biosynthesis pathway also exhibited the 19−idd pattern. in this case, the pattern characterizing the whole group was driven by the expression of the ggp gene, which codify for a gdp-galactose phosphorylase  <cit>  . the results presented in alós et al.  <cit>  showing the relative expression of genes involved in the ascorbic acid pathway  are highly correlated with the expression levels obtained here and presented in additional file 1: figure af1- <dig> and table af1- <dig>  even though the cultivars and methods employed are different. this suggests that the pattern for the expression of genes involved in the ascorbic acid pathway is consistent between cultivars when comparing equivalent states of development.

carotenoid biosynthesis
carotenoids are visual markers of chili pepper maturation. color of the fruits may change from green to yellow, orange or red, depending on the type of carotenoids synthesized and accumulated by the fruits  <cit> . nine genes grouped into the carotenoid biosynthesis mp exhibited the expression pattern 6−dsi, characterized by a significant decrease in net expression from  <dig> to  <dig> daa, a steady state from  <dig> to  <dig> daa and a significant increase between  <dig> to  <dig> daa.

the expression patterns and levels for genes grouped into the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway are shown in additional file 1: table af1- <dig> and figure af1- <dig>  respectively. for eight of the nine genes grouped into this pathway, the expression pattern was characterized by a significant up-regulation between  <dig> and  <dig> daa, where the color change from green to red in chili pepper fruits usually occurs . of these genes, the one with the largest change in expression was a gene encoding a capsanthin/capsorubin synthase. expression of this gene increased markedly, from  <dig> transcripts per million  at  <dig> daa to  <dig>  tpm at  <dig> daa . another gene with a large influence on the net expression behavior of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway was a β-carotene hydroxylase , which showed an expression change from  <dig> tpm at  <dig> daa to  <dig>  tpm at  <dig> daa. notably, none of these carotenoid biosynthesis genes were up-regulated during the first period from  <dig> to  <dig> daa when chili fruits are still green. our results confirm the findings of romar et al.  <cit>  showing that genes involved in the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway are not coregulated during chili fruit ripening, which is consistent with the hypothesis regarding differences in the expression of these genes. ha et al. studied carotenoid accumulation and expression of genes involved in the carotenoid pathway in chili varieties with different levels of fully ripe color  <cit> . in that study the authors concluded that the expression levels of the phytoene synthase, phytoene desaturase, and capsanthin/capsorubin synthase genes are high in peppers with high levels of total carotenoids. these results are consistent with our findings, given that ‘tampiqueño 74’ is a cultivar with strong red color at maturity . moreover, the results presented here add a more precise time frame for the expression of these genes .

comparison of qrt-pcr vs. rna-seq results for genes related to carotenoid biosynthesis
in order to validate the chili pepper fruit transcriptome rna-seq results, we conducted a qrt-pcr analysis of the nine above mentioned carotenoid biosynthesis genes . the expression of each of the nine genes was calculated at each developmental time point using the 2−ΔΔct method  <cit>  and expressed as a log <dig> fold-change relative to the level of expression determined at  <dig> daa. figure  <dig> presents the log <dig> fold-change in expression estimated using both rna-seq and qrt-pcr methods as well as the pearson’s correlation  between the fold-changes obtained from each method for each gene. the values of r for the nine genes ranged from a minimum of  <dig>   to a maximum of  <dig>  , with a mean value of  <dig> . thus, the expression estimates obtained using the two methods were largely in agreement. we evaluated the concordance between these two methods by comparing their ability to discriminate the tendencies of genes to significantly increase or decrease in expression according to the previously established  <dig> patterns. for three genes   both methods identified the same trend during all three intervals. for  <dig> genes , both methods identified the same trend in two of three intervals. only for the isopentenyl pyrophosphate isomerase-encoding gene  there was a complete discordance between the two methods. the standard deviation values for the expression of the isopentenyl pyrophosphate isomerase-encoding gene in the rna-seq analysis  were the largest among all  <dig> genes related to carotenoid biosynthesis. we speculate that expression of this gene has a larger intrinsic variation than the other genes considered, and this can explain both the low level of correlation  as well as the lack of concordance between the rna-seq and qrt-pcr estimations.

our qrt-pcr analysis also confirmed the finding that genes pertaining to carotenoid biosynthesis were most abundantly expressed during the last period of fruit maturation, reaching their maximum levels at  <dig> daa.

CONCLUSIONS
this study presents a detailed analysis of gene expression in chili pepper fruit at four stages of development. we estimated that our rna-seq transcriptomes may be missing approximately  <dig>  genes expressed at very low levels and that the scaled number of mrna molecules in the samples were about the same sizes as the number of cdna reads obtained. we analyzed the expression patterns of individual genes, as well as groups of genes categorized into biological processes  ontologies and metabolic pathways . the most prevalent pattern was for individual genes as well as the bp and mp groupings to change their behavior only during the third interval, from  <dig> to  <dig> daa. in this interval, down-regulated genes were more prevalent, marking the end of the fruit maturation and the starting point of senescence. we also concluded that transcriptome diversity was at its maximum at  <dig> daa and that the transcriptome of the mature fruit at  <dig> daa was the most specialized and least diverse of the transcriptomes studied.

we demonstrated that by grouping genes and studying the pattern of expression of the groups as well as the individual components, it was possible to gain insight into the behavior of the whole system. by using this approach we inferred, for example, that the most abundant expression of genes related to capsaicinoid and ascorbic acid biosynthesis occurred at  <dig> daa, while for genes related to carotenoid biosynthesis the maximum was estimated at  <dig> daa.
