BACKGROUND
to adapt to hard winter conditions, many organisms living in temperate regions use photoperiod cues to anticipate the transition between autumn and winter. such seasonal photoperiodism enables individuals to prepare winter installation through physiological or behavioural adaptations such as migration, hibernation or over-wintering egg-laying. aphids are plant phloem feeding insects that provoke significant damage to agricultural crops. as poikiloterm animals, they do not regulate their internal temperature and die in cold winters. they bypass this difficulty by producing over-wintering eggs in the autumn that enter diapause during the winter period. aphids are among the rare organisms practicing cyclical parthenogenesis during their annual life-cycle  <cit> , alternating between viviparous parthenogenesis and oviparous sexual reproduction. in spring, eggs hatch and the new born aphids develop clonal colonies by parthenogenesis: viviparous females produce other viviparous females that are genetically identical, without haploid gamete formation or meiotic recombination  <cit> . at the end of the summer, these colonies produce, by clonal parthenogenesis, sexual morphs  that mate, these oviparous sexual females then lay eggs before winter.

in viviparous parthenogenetic aphids, embryos develop within the abdomen of their mother. each mother contains several dozens of embryos at different stages of development. the most developed embryos have nearly complete differentiation of their ovaries with a germarium and several follicle chambers. embryos at early stages are already formed within these follicle chambers. thus, an adult viviparous female aphid contains two embedded generations: nearly fully developed embryos and early embryos within these developed embryos. this is the so-called "telescoping of generations".

the switch between parthenogenetic and sexual reproduction in aphids is driven by the variation of abiotic factors in autumn, primarily the photoperiod. photoperiod shortening is sufficient to trigger the switch in the reproductive mode; decrease in temperature further promotes this switch  <cit> . aphids measure the length of the night phase ; a minimum number of consecutive inductive nights is required to trigger the switch in the reproductive mode  <cit> . several observations suggest that in aphids, part of the photoperiodic signal is detected by the protocerebrum in the brain through the cuticular head capsules  <cit> . several aphid putative photoreceptors and transducer proteins have been located in the protocerebrum and the compound eyes in megoura viciae  <cit> . early transduction of the photoperiod signal involves a group of neurosecretory cells  located in the pars intercerebralis of the aphid protocerebum  <cit> . transduction of the photoperiodic signal to the target tissues and cells located in the ovaries is still unresolved; however, ectopic applications of melatonin  <cit>  or juvenile hormones  <cit>  suggest that these molecules play key roles in the oocyte fate. during viviparous parthenogenesis, the photoperiodic signal may be detected and/or transduced through the different embedded generations; the regulatory mechanisms of such trans-generational signalling are not known.

recently, with the development of genomic tools for the pea aphid acyrthosiphon pisum  <cit> , global analyses of gene regulation have been undertaken between aphids producing or not sexual. a receptor of gaba whose mrna is up-regulated in long-night reared insects has already been identified  <cit> . our group was the first to demonstrate that genes encoding cuticle and signalling proteins are regulated by shortening of the photoperiod  <cit> . to date, these studies have been performed on one development stage and during only one generation.

herein, we analysed the transcriptomic and proteomic response of the pea aphid to shortening of the photoperiod at different stages covering the two parthenogenetic generations required before the birth of the future sexuals. we observed very few transcripts were regulated in the heads of the grand-mothers. in contrast, major changes occurred in the heads of mothers of the future sexual; these are probably linked to the developmental program of parthenogenetics that are sexual producers. genes with putative functions in visual cues, photoreception, cuticle structure and the insulin pathway are particularly discussed.

RESULTS
microarray and dige experiments were performed in order to identify gene and protein expression profiles accompanying the switch from asexual to sexual reproduction induced by a shortening of the photoperiod in aphids. all rna and protein samples were collected from dissected pea aphid heads in order to focus on the early steps of the photoperiodic signal detection and transduction, and to eliminate rnas and polypeptides of the next generation contained within the abdomen.

slight transcriptomic response in the heads of the grand-mother generation
transcript profiles between long-night  or short-night  reared aphids were compared at different stages of production of sexual individuals: two stages for generation g <dig>  grand-mothers) and two for g <dig>  . of the  <dig> spotted cdnas,  <dig>  passed the quality filters of image analysis and normalization at l4-g <dig> stage,  <dig>  at wa-g <dig> stage,  <dig>  at l2-g <dig> stage and  <dig>  at l4-g <dig> stage. statistical analyzes were performed on log-ratios of normalized values of fluorescence of ln rna samples and of sn rna samples. four independent analyses  were performed using the sam software, and the statistical test was of one-class response type .  <dig> transcripts were detected as regulated at l4-g <dig> stage ,  <dig> transcripts  at wa-g <dig> stage with high fdr, indicating that a very low number of transcripts are regulated in g <dig>  the selection of high fdr was necessary to obtain significantly regulated genes, since a lower fdr value provided no significantly regulated genes in the g <dig>  in contrary,  <dig> transcripts  at l2-g <dig> stage and  <dig>  at l4-g <dig> with low fdr. these changes of expression revealed that the major transcriptomic modifications occurred in heads of the mothers of the future sexuals , whereas few transcripts were differentially expressed in heads of the grand-mothers  of the future sexuals .

the dige analysis performed at l4-g <dig> and l2-g <dig> stages identified  <dig> significantly regulated polypeptides at the g <dig> generation, and only  <dig> at the g <dig> generation . this corresponds to  <dig> % of the total proteins detected on a 2d-gel, whereas nearly 10% of the transcripts captured by the microarrays were regulated.

induction of sexual morphs accross  <dig> generations
three generations  were used to collect samples for microarray hybridizations and dige analyses. this protocol ensured that the complete chain leading to the production of sexual individuals was obtained . the low level of regulated transcripts in the heads of the first generation supported lees' hypothesis  <cit>  that there was little or no grand-mother effect on the detection of the photoperiod changes. consequently, under ln conditions, the embryos within the grand-mother might directly detect the photoperiod shortening through the abdominal cuticle of the grand-mother.

the offspring of individuals reared under ln conditions at l <dig> stage  at  <dig> distinct temperatures  was analyzed in terms of percentage of sexual -producers or parthenogenetic-producers. the offspring of control individuals maintained under continuous ln conditions across  <dig> generations is also indicated for comparison.

to experimentally eliminate the grand-maternal effect, new-born l <dig> were directly transferred from sn to ln conditions. once they reached adulthood, their offspring was analyzed for production of sexual morphs. in this experiment, the induction process took place across only  <dig> generations . progeny analyses showed that at 18°c or 15°c , 96% and  <dig> % of the individuals respectively were already sexual-producers. in both cases, the most of the sexual individuals were males . these results suggest that even when the number of sexual females was decreased, production of sexual morphs was possible in two generations: this confirms the hypothesis that signalling from the grand-mother is not essential for the switch in the reproductive mode in the pea aphid.

functional annotation of regulated polypeptides
a search for homologies in the ncbi non-redundant database and in a home-made pea aphid database was performed for the  <dig> regulated polypeptides. about 73%  of the proteins shared homologies with identified proteins, and 27%  corresponded to orphan genes . approximately 70% of these proteins were up-regulated by the photoperiod shortening. fold changes of differentially expressed polypeptides ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for those up-regulated and - <dig>  to - <dig>  for those down-regulated. based on sequence homology, classification of polypeptides into functional groups  indicated that 28% of the regulated polypeptides were involved in "metabolic process". in addition to this strong molecular signature,  <dig> %  corresponded to "structural constituents of cuticle",  <dig> % to "translation, transcription regulatory activity",  <dig> % to "immune response and response to stress", and  <dig> % to "binding and electron carrier activity".  <dig> % of identified polypeptides are implicated in "structural constituents of cytoskeleton", and 7% in "development process and reproduction". the "metabolism" thus corresponds to the largest group, indicating a large modification of the metabolism in short-day reared insects.

functional annotation of regulated transcripts
a search for homologs in the non-redundant database was performed for the  <dig> different transcripts selected as undergoing significant regulatory changes. functional annotation was assisted by data from flybase and uniprot databases, supported by the gene ontology classification. about  <dig> % of the transcripts shared homology with identified genes, and  <dig> % corresponded to orphan genes . approximately half of the transcripts were either up-or down-regulated by photoperiod shortening. fold changes of differentially expressed transcripts ranged from - <dig>  to - <dig>  for down-regulated genes and from + <dig>  to + <dig>  for up-regulated genes. classification of transcripts into different functional groups  indicated that 20% of the transcripts were involved in "translation, transcription regulatory activity" ,  <dig> % in "binding and electron carrier activity" and  <dig> % in "metabolic process".  <dig> % of the regulated transcripts were involved in "structural constituents of cytoskeleton" and 1% in "immune response and response to stress". more strikingly, the analyses revealed that  <dig> % of the regulated genes were involved in "structural constituents of cuticle":  <dig> transcripts corresponded to cuticular proteins,  <dig> transcripts encoded enzymes involved in chitin metabolism and  <dig> were homologous to glycin rich proteins, known to be major constituents of the cuticle  <cit> . the majority of arthropods cuticular proteins contain a conserved region known as the rebers and riddiford consensus . three distinct forms of this extended consensus have been defined  <cit> : rr <dig>  rr <dig> and rr <dig>  a search of such motifs using the cuticledb website  <cit>  indicated that of the  <dig> transcripts encoding cuticular proteins,  <dig> contained a rr <dig> domain,  <dig> contained a rr <dig> domain whereas  <dig> did not contain any of the rr domains .

apart from this strong biological signature corresponding to the differential expression of cuticular protein genes in our experiment, 6% of the differentially expressed transcripts corresponded to genes known to be involved in "development and signalling" . eight transcripts had homology with proteins involved in nervous system development, from axon guidance and crossing to synaptogenesis. seven transcripts had homology with proteins implicated in the visual system ,  <dig> with proteins mediating neurotransmission,  <dig> with proteins involved in hormonal regulation and  <dig> regulated by the circadian rhythm.

regulated transcripts or proteins were divided into  <dig> categories: nervous system development, neurotransmission, visual system and others. the accession numbers of each contig, est or geneid and the accession number of the corresponding d. melanogaster transcripts  or protein  are indicated, as well as their putative function and their level of regulation at the corresponding stages.

statistic analyses were performed to identify significant enrichment of gene families in the significantly regulated genes compared to all the genes spotted on the microarray. each of the spotted genes with a homolog in d. melanogaster has been assigned the corresponding go terms. from the initial set of  <dig> spotted cdnas and  <dig> regulated cdnas,  <dig> and  <dig>  were assigned at least one go term. the list of significant terms is given in additional file  <dig>  this general analysis demonstrates enrichment in biosynthetic processes and confirms the enrichment in structural constituents of cuticle and ribosomes.

despite the quantitative difference in the data, the combined transcriptomic and proteomic approach allowed the identification of common genes and proteins regulated by the photoperiod. this includes several heat shock or zinc finger proteins, translation initiation factors, protein kinases, myosin-like proteins and several other proteins from the general metabolism. most interestingly, pea aphid homologs of kinesins putatively involved in synaptic vesicle transport, and rho gtpases involved in axon guidance were regulated at both transcriptomic and proteomic level .

discussion
the objective of our microarray and dige analyses was to identify cellular pathways regulated in the heads of the pea aphid during the switch from parthenogenesis to sexual reproduction. 5% of proteins and 10% of transcripts changed significantly in our experiments. the total protein extraction procedure does not allow an exhaustive extraction of the whole pea aphid proteome, and the microarray contained about 19% of the  <dig>  predicted genes of the pea aphid genome. thus, although this work allows high throughput analysis of protein and transcripts regulated during shortening of the photoperiod, it does not cover the whole proteome and transcriptome of the pea aphid. nevertheless, the dige and transcriptomic analyses identified an important regulation of proteins involved in general metabolism and of transcripts corresponding to the protein synthesis machinery. this strong general signature indicates that the parthenogenetic morph producing sexuals that appear in the autumn has a different metabolism to the parthenogenetic morph producing parthenogenetic individuals, despite the absence of morphological differences between them.

not essential grand-mother effect
the process of induction of sexual morphs in our experimental conditions utilized three generations. the grand-mothers  are the first individuals that experiments ln conditions. they are parthenogenetic and their embryos  will be the parthenogenetic mothers of the future sexual individuals . we thus analyzed dige and/or transcriptomic profiles of aphid heads at different developmental stages for each generation. the first conclusion from these analyses is that the transcriptome of the grand-mothers is only slightly modified by shortening of the photoperiod, suggesting, as hypothesized several years ago  <cit> , that there is little or no transmission of the photoperiod signal from the grand-mother to the mother of the future sexuals. in aphids, a minimum number of consecutive ln is necessary to observe the irreversible production of sexual morphs. for the clone yr <dig> of the pea aphid and in our conditions, this number is  <dig>  <cit> . l4-g <dig> aphids were collected after  <dig> consecutive ln cycles and wa-g <dig> aphids after  <dig> cycles. it is thus possible that after such numbers of consecutive ln, the major modifications of gene regulation that lead to the production of sexual morphs are not initiated. another possibility is that embryos of the future mothers could detect photoperiodic signals already within the abdomen of the grand-mothers, before their birth  <cit> . indeed, we observed that an induction of sexual morphs across  <dig> generations  was possible. the almost complete absence of transcriptomic and proteomic modifications in the heads of the grand-mothers suggests the embryos have the capacity to directly sense environmental cues through the cuticle of their mother before birth.

photoperiod shortening regulates the expression of transcripts involved in visual system and photoreception
based on a similarity search, several of the significantly regulated genes corresponded to proteins known to be involved in photoreception or related to the visual system . although aphid photoperiodic receptors are still uncharacterized, it is generally accepted that in insects, rhodopsins are synthesized within neuron bodies of ommatidies and transported to their surface. calnexin, which is up-regulated under ln conditions, is essential for rhodopsin maturation and transport  <cit> . then, arrestin <dig>  is translocated when rhodopsins are photoactivated by the light source  <cit> . this suggests an involvement of rhodopsin in the response of aphids to photoperiod shortening. gao et al.  <cit>  localized rhodopsin and arrestin polypeptides in both the compound eyes and the protocerebrum of the aphid m. viciae. shiga and numata  <cit>  suggested that several photoreceptor systems could be involved in the phoroperiodic response in insects, implicating both intra-and extra-retinal components. in complement, the strongly up-regulated  is an inhibitor of protein phosphatase- <dig>  that is important for axon targeting of photoreceptor r-cells in d. melanogaster  <cit> . finally, two transcripts related to the conjugation of β-alanine and dopamine shared similarity with the black and the ebony gene of d. melanogaster. black  <cit>  and ebony mutants  <cit>  respond abnormally to visual cues, suggesting a role in d. melanogaster visual system. these genes are also involved in cuticle structure .

photoperiod shortening links cuticle modification and dopamine pathway
at least  <dig> pea aphid cuticular homologs were regulated by photoperiod shortening, some of these exhibit very high levels of differential expression . several genes have been already shown to be regulated by short days in the pea aphid; our data extends this observation to a larger number of cuticular protein genes  <cit> . the dige experiment did not show any regulation of cuticular proteins, probably because extraction of cuticular proteins requires specific procedures. among the  <dig> cuticular proteins transcripts regulated by seasonal photoperiodism in this analysis,  <dig> contained a rr <dig> or rr <dig> domain.

the strong down-regulation of rr <dig> containing proteins suggests a modification of the cuticle. the cuticle is the storage site for several metabolites such as β-alanyldopamine   <cit> . nbad forms electrostatic links between cuticular proteins and thus reinforces the cuticular matrix. if the down-regulation of cuticular proteins during photoperiod shortening is associated with a relaxation of the chitin-cuticular protein network, what is the fate of nbad in such a cuticle? nbad conjugation is driven by the ebony gene in d. melanogaster. in our experiment, we observed that the pea aphid transcripts homologs to ebony were down-regulated in l4-g <dig>  suggesting that less nbad is formed during photoperiod shortening. β-alanin is synthesized from aspartate under the control of black gene in d. melanogaster. the pea aphid transcripts homolog to black were down-regulated at l2-g <dig> and l4-g <dig> stages, suggesting that ln reared aphids synthesized less β-alanin. consequently, a putative modification of the cuticle in response to day-length shortening could be related to a decrease of stored nbad and β-alanin. this might result in the modification of dopamine concentration in aphid brains . this biogenic amine is a neurotransmitter and we suggest that it could play a role in the photoperiod signalling during the switch in the reproductive mode of the pea aphid.

photoperiod signal transduction involves the neuro-endocrine system
many significantly regulated genes are putatively involved in nervous system development, supporting the hypotheses that nervous system structures are modified by seasonal photoperiodism  <cit> . a group of neurosecretory cells forming two clusters in the pars intercerebralis of the protocerebrum probably release neurosecretory material that could be transported along axon projections to targeted cells  <cit> . several of the regulated genes showing homology to proteins implicated in axon guidance   <cit>  or the development of the central nervous system and synapses such as wunen or hdd <dig>  <cit>  might be involved in this process. these two transcripts had already been detected as regulated at l3-g <dig> stage in earlier experiments  <cit> , which supports their putative involvement in the transduction of the photoperiodic signal. dige experiments also detected the differential expression of  <dig> proteins, a g-protein-regulated inducer and a rho-gtpase-activating protein, known to be involved in neurite growth in drosophila, again supporting the role of the nervous structures in this mechanism.

neurotransmitters might also be part of the transduction pathway of the photoperiodic signal. dunc-13-4a and dunc 10-4a are involved in synapse vesicle release  <cit>  and depcontaining protein is probably involved in dopaminergic transmission  <cit> . both microarray and dige experiments detected a differential expression of the transcript/protein homolog to dunc 10-4a, indicating its possible importance in the response of the pea aphid to photoperiod shortening.

it has been previously suggested that viviparous parthenogenetic aphids reared under long nights and giving birth to sexual morphs have lower concentration of juvenile hormone  than aphids reared under short nights  <cit> . in d. melanogaster mutations in insulin signalling pathway alter jh synthesis  <cit> . in our experiment, two genes related to proteins of the insulin pathway were detected as significantly regulated. one is a putative insulin receptor that is down regulated and the second a putative insulin degrading enzyme that is up-regulated. this suggests a link between insulin pathway and jh in seasonal photoperiodism of the pea aphid, as already shown in the mosquito culex pipiens for diapause, or in the honey bee for cast determination  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
general transcriptomic and proteomic analyses strengthen the observation that aphid' embryos can detect seasonal photoperiodism directly within their mother and that signalling between grand-mothers and mothers is not essential. several genes putatively involved in photoreception and neuro-endocrine signalisation have been identified. we propose a working hypothesis linking photoreception, cuticle modification and neuro-endocrine signalization in response to photoperiod shortening.
