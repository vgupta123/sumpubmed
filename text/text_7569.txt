BACKGROUND
salmonella foodborne infection is a common but important public health issue worldwide. among the many serovars, salmonella typhimurium is frequently isolated from outbreaks as one of the common bacterial causative agents. the world health organization has also emphasized the rising concern of multidrug resistance in this non-typhoid salmonella serovar, which potentially accounts for the transfer of antimicrobial resistance to other human pathogens  <cit> . with the continual reduction in the cost for high-throughput genome sequencing, thousands of genomes of pathogenic bacteria have now been sequenced and salmonella is of no exception  <cit> . in addition to the conventional analysis of antimicrobial resistance profiles, coupling of genome sequencing to phylogenetic analysis has opened new trends of in-depth epidemiological studies at both regional and global levels. over the past few years, hundreds of genomes of various salmonella serovars, including typhimurium  <cit> , enteritidis  <cit> , typhi  <cit> , newport  <cit> , heidelberg  <cit> , and pullorum  <cit> , were sequenced to facilitate evolutionary studies, as well as epidemiological and pathogenicity investigations in this important pathogen.

despite the availability of genome sequences for s. typhimurium isolates from all around the world, the japanese strain t <dig> remained as the only sequenced and published isolate from northeastern asia  <cit> . here we report the use of high-throughput genome sequencing, coupled to traditional microbiological testing method, in a retrospective study of salmonella typhimurium strains isolated from subjects hospitalized in hong kong over the past two decades. specifically, we reconstructed the phylogenetic relationship and investigated the distribution and mutation patterns of virulence determinants among  <dig> local isolates.

methods
bacterial strains
a total of 20 s. typhimurium isolates  were obtained from patients admitted to the hospitals of the new territories east cluster of the hospital authority in hong kong between  <dig> and  <dig>  written informed consent for using the blood and stool samples in the study was obtained from all participants. seven blood isolates, three of which isolated in the mid 90’s and the rest isolated in the mid 00’s, and  <dig> stool isolates were obtained by standard procedures. the blood isolates are representatives of the circulating clones during the sampling periods and act as representatives of systemic infection whereas the stool isolates were used as the genetic background for comparison purpose. the 10-year span between isolate collections allows determination of endemicity of the selected strains. these isolates were confirmed biochemically by the ap120e system .table  <dig> information of patients and corresponding s. typhimurium clinical isolates



genome sequencing and de novo assembly
genomic dna from the isolates was extracted using prepman ultra reagent  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. whole-genome shotgun sequencing was performed on a  <dig> gs flx titanium platform   <cit> . bases sequenced and corresponding quality values were called and delivered in standard format by gs flx for downstream bioinformatic analyses. sequence reads were assembled de novo using newbler assembler .

snps extraction and phylogenetic analysis
all snp positions were obtained by aligning the genome sequences of the  <dig> isolates with the reference strain lt <dig>  <cit>  chromosome using mauve and  <dig> gs reference mapper  <cit> . raw snp calls were filtered to ensure that at least 90 % of the reads support the snp. snps called in phage sequences and repetitive regions of the reference genome were excluded. only snps located in the salmonella core genes  <cit>  were included in the phylogenetic analysis. all remaining snps were concatenated to generate a single pseudo-sequence. phylogenetic analyses were conducted in mega   <cit>  and phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using the maximum parsimony  method with a heuristic search based on the tree bisection and reconnection  approach. salmonella enteritidis pt <dig>  and salmonella choleraesuis sc-b <dig>  were used as outgroups. nodal supports were inferred from  <dig> bootstrap replicates.

antimicrobials resistance profiling
the 20 s. typhimurium isolates were tested for susceptibility to ampicillin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim, and ciprofloxacin by an agar dilution method according to the recommendations of the clinical and laboratory standards institute   <cit> . isolates with minimal inhibitory concentrations  greater than those for susceptible strains as suggested by clsi were regarded as resistant. multidrug resistance was defined as resistant to three or more of the antimicrobials tested.

virulence determinants analysis
genes and mutations responsible for antimicrobial resistance were retrieved from the literature and compared among the  <dig> isolates. virulence factors and salmonella pathogenicity islands  for salmonella pathogenicity were obtained from the virulence factors database   and aligned against each of the respective genome sequences for the detection of genetic variations  <cit> . prophage elements for the isolates were identified by the web server phage search tool    <cit> .

RESULTS
phylogenetic tree analysis revealed two major phylogenetic clades in hong kong
genomes of  <dig> local s. typhimurium isolates were sequenced here with an average depth of 38× . the snp-based phylogenetic trees grouped the s. typhimurium isolates into two major phylogenetic clades . clade a consisted of  <dig> isolates with a predominance of nine stool isolates and only a single blood isolate, whereas clade b consisted of a total of seven isolates including three blood isolates and four stool isolates. the remaining three isolates appeared to be sporadic infections and they were also distantly related by themselves. intriguingly, they were all blood isolates. the year of isolation did not seem to be an important determining factor in the phylogeny, as isolates retrieved from the 90’s and 00’s were both found in each of the clades.table  <dig> statistics for the  <dig> sequenced s. typhimurium genomes

contrasting antimicrobials resistance profiles among phylogenetic clades
the  <dig> isolates were tested for their susceptibility to five antimicrobials from different classes . fifteen of the isolates  were resistant to at least one antimicrobial class. more than half of the strains were resistant to ampicillin , trimethoprim  and chloramphenicol , while less was resistant to ciprofloxacin  and gentamicin . except gentamicin, the proportion of resistance to ampicillin, trimethoprim, chloramphenicol, and ciprofloxacin was higher in the blood isolates  than the stool isolates . among the  <dig> isolates,  <dig>  were multidrug-resistant, in which five were blood isolates. intriguingly, with respect to the phylogenetic tree above, all seven isolates within clade b were multidrug-resistant, with all of them resistant to the older antimicrobials ampicillin and chloramphenicol and six of them resistant to trimethoprim. in contrast, among the  <dig> isolates from clade a, only two of them were multidrug-resistant, with at least half of them still susceptible to these older antimicrobials.table  <dig> susceptibility to five antimicrobials for the 20 s. typhimurium isolates

loss of virulence determinants in clade a isolates
genome sequence analysis revealed the absence of the virulence plasmid pslt, a ~90 kb plasmid of lt <dig> which harbors many important virulence factors including the spv locus, pef  locus and the complement resistance gene rck  <cit> , in the  <dig> clade a isolates.

the salmonella pathogenicity islands , which encode two type iii secretion systems  and a number of virulence effectors, represent another category of important virulence factors. genome sequences revealed that spi1- <dig> were present in all  <dig> isolates and were highly conserved in sequence. however, a number of snps were found in spis in isolates from clade a, for instance, fhla  in spi <dig>  orf <dig>  and ssec  in spi <dig> as well as sugr  and mgtb  in spi <dig> . the snp in ssec, which was shown to be an important effector protein to alter host cell physiology and promote bacterial survival  <cit> , resulted in a previously undescribed glu424 > asp amino acid change. another effector protein ssei/srfh, which lies within the gifsy- <dig> prophage, also showed a snp at nucleotide position  <dig> and resulted in a ala47 > thr amino acid change. nevertheless, other effector proteins, including those encoded outside of spi <dig> and spi <dig> such as sopb and sope <dig>  did not show any sequence variation.

apart from the pslt plasmid and snps in the spis, isolates in clade a also contained less genetic materials arisen from prophages. all isolates from clade b contained a complete copy of the salmonella prophages gifsy- <dig> and gifsy- <dig>  <cit> , whereas isolates from clade a contained only ~ <dig> and ~68 % genetic materials from the respective prophages. this apparent reduction of genomic content had resulted in the loss of several genes previously implicated to involve in long-term systemic infection in mice  and replication in macrophages   <cit> . while five out of the seven isolates from clade b contained a complete copy of fels- <dig>  isolates from clade a and the three sporadic isolates did not harbor this salmonella prophage. in addition, isolates in clade a had also lost a total of ~20 % of genetic materials from phage st <dig> compared to clade b isolates, whereas sporadic isolates st2850/ <dig> and st8493/ <dig> did not harbor st <dig>  instead, these two isolates contained a complete copy of the phage st64b, which is also identified in many previously sequenced salmonella isolates but not in isolates in clade a, b, lt <dig> and the japanese isolate t <dig>  <cit> .

discussion
the potential reemergence of lt <dig> progeny
salmonella typhimurium is one of the most common bacterial causes of foodborne infections in hong kong, with 150– <dig> reported cases each year. nevertheless, genomes of these clinical isolates have seldom been sequenced. in this report, we present genome sequences of 20 s. typhimurium clinical isolates in hong kong throughout 1993– <dig>  phylogenetic analysis indicated that two major phylogenetic clades  had been circulating in hong kong for almost the past two decades, with some sporadic infections caused by phylogenetically distinct isolates. we showed that several of the previously sequenced s. typhimurium isolates, including the human isolates dt <dig>  <cit>  and d <dig>  <cit> , did not show high phylogenetic relatedness to isolates either in clade a or b . notably, isolates from clade b showed remarkable genetic relatedness to the laboratory reference strain lt <dig>  which was originally isolated in the 1940s. comparative genomic analysis also indicated that the japanese isolate t <dig> displays high similarity to isolates in clade b. izumiya et al.  <cit>  commented that multidrug-resistant progeny of lt <dig> might be reemerging alongside dt <dig> and other definitive phage-type strains, and our data suggested that such progeny of lt <dig> might have already reemerged in regions nearby japan over at least the past two decades.

analysis of antimicrobial resistance determinants
we also showed that the clade a and b isolates differed remarkably in their level of virulence in terms of antimicrobials resistance, presence of virulence plasmids and prophage elements. not only did clade b comprise a higher proportion of blood isolates, all isolates within the clade were also multidrug-resistant. genome sequence alignment revealed that none of our  <dig> local isolates harbor a complete copy of the salmonella genomic island  <dig>  found in the dt <dig> lineage  <cit> . specifically, all isolates in clade a did not harbor any of the genomic fragments from sgi <dig>  intriguingly, isolates in clade b harbor an approximately  <dig>  kb-fragment originated from sgi <dig> , which is represented by a class  <dig> integron consisting of oxa- <dig> beta-lactamase blaoxa- <dig>  aminoglycoside resistance protein aada <dig>  a small multidrug resistance protein qaceΔ <dig> and sulfonamide resistance gene sul <dig>  this class  <dig> integron is in turn located within the previously characterized 82 kb gi-dt <dig> genomic island in t <dig>  together with the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and tetracycline resistance protein teta genes  <cit>  located  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb upstream, respectively, to the class  <dig> integron, this genomic island confers resistance to a number of antimicrobials including ampicillin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, sulfonamide drugs, and quaternary ammonium compounds.fig.  <dig> brig diagrams showing an overview of the genomic relationship between the seven sequenced group b s. typhimurium isolates and a the sgi <dig> genomic island in dt <dig>  and b the t <dig> plasmid pstmdt12_l   <cit> . the innermost rings  represent the reference sequences, and the outer rings show blastn comparisons of the group b genomes against the references using an e-value cut-off of  <dig> . known genes of sgi <dig> in dt <dig>  <cit>  and known protein products of open reading frames in the resistance island of pstmdt12_l  <cit>  are marked on the outermost rings in  and , respectively



the large plasmid pstmdt12_l identified in t <dig> is also exclusively found in the clade b isolates . nevertheless, due to the presence of four transposases  and a recombination protein in the plasmid, the resistance island showed structural variation, which results in the existence of the aminoglycoside 3-n-acetyltransferase gene , for gentamicin resistance) in only four of the isolates and the dihydrofolate reductase gene  in only three of the isolates.

ciprofloxacin resistance in salmonella typhimurium as well as other serovars, most notably typhi and paratyphi, has become a global concern in recent years  <cit> . five out of our  <dig> isolates  were shown to be ciprofloxacin-resistant. the first four isolates were from clade b, and they demonstrated similar mutation patterns in the quinolone resistance-determining regions  in the dna gyrase a  and dna topoisomerase iv subunit a and b  genes  <cit> . genomic sequences revealed a ser83 > phe mutation in gyra for all the four isolates, but at amino acid  <dig>  it was asp87 > asn for st4806/ <dig> and asp87 > gly for the remaining three. mutation for parc was a consistent ser80 > arg, but for the pare gene it was the rarely described leu416 > phe for st4806/ <dig> and the more common ser458 > pro for the rest. no mutations were identified in the gyrb gene. interestingly, the only ciprofloxacin-resistant strain outside clade b, st4024/ <dig>  showed only a single mutation  without any additional mutation in either gyrb, parc or pare genes. this suggests that only a single mutation in the qrdr of gyra is sufficient to confer resistance to ciprofloxacin.

evolution of ciprofloxacin-resistant strains
as noted above, ciprofloxacin resistance was only identified in strains isolated in the 00’s and not noted in the 90’s. in particular, four of these isolates were from the more virulent clade b. despite additional antimicrobials has not been tested, resistance to ciprofloxacin has often been associated with quinolones resistance. such combination of multidrug and a potential quinolone resistance has prompted clinicians to pay attention to the spread of progenies from s. typhimurium strains in clade b.

CONCLUSIONS
our study revealed the existence of two major phylogenetic clades of salmonella typhimurium clinical isolates circulating in hong kong over the past two decades. the two clades differ remarkably in antimicrobial susceptibility, presentation and mutations of virulence determinants and members in one of the clades are shown to be close relatives and likely progenies of the laboratory reference strain lt <dig>  such potential dissemination of this multidrug-resistant group of s. typhimurium in the northeast asia should deserve more attention.
