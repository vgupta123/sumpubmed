BACKGROUND
some urodele amphibians possess an extraordinary capacity for regeneration  <cit> . the newt notophthalmus viridescens  can completely regenerate limbs, tail, jaws, lens and retina after amputation or following attacks of natural predators. interestingly, newts are also able to regenerate internal organs such as parts of the central nervous system  <cit>  and parts of the ventricles of the heart after amputation or mechanical damage  <cit>  suggesting that they exhibit a general program that enables regenerative responses. this ability distinguishes newts  from other vertebrates, which have lost  the capacity for comprehensive organ regeneration. mammals, for example, are not able to repair substantial cardiac injuries by replacement with functional tissue. instead, the mammalian heart responds with scar formation and fibrosis resulting in severe functional impairment . the failure of mammalian hearts to regenerate seems to be caused by the inability of cardiac myocytes to proliferate and a preference for hemostasis and fibrosis, which occurred during evolution, together with the advent of high-pressure circulation  <cit> .

newt cardiomyocytes are virtually non-proliferative in undamaged hearts but respond to cardiac injuries by proliferation  <cit> . at present, it is not clear whether proliferating cardiomyocytes arise solely from resting cardiomyocytes, which might undergo partial de-differentiation or re-programming, or also from dedicated cardiac stem cells that are able to replace lost cardiac tissue. despite this open question it is undisputed that newt cardiomyocytes re-enter the cell cycle in inductive environments. the plasticity of newt cardiomyocytes to adopt a different cellular fate is also demonstrated by their ability to contribute to skeletal muscle formation in regenerating limbs  <cit> .

understanding gene expression during critical stages of cardiac regeneration is a fundamental prerequisite to decode the molecular processes, which enable newt cardiomyocytes to re-enter the cell cycle and functionally replace, lost cardiac tissue. considering its exceptional regenerative capabilities, surprising little sequence information is available for the newt. by the end of  <dig>   <dig> entries were listed in the ncbi database, which encode a maximum of  <dig> non-redundant proteins including  <dig> very short sequences. another  <dig> unique sequences were present in the nucleotide database resulting in a total number of around  <dig> unique sequences, which correspond to expressed genes from n. viridescens. limited est datasets exist so far for two other urodele amphibians; the mexican axolotl  and the eastern tiger salamander   <cit> . both species belong to the family of ambystomatidae  that have separated from the salamandridae family after divergence of family-level salamander lineages more than  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . the paucity of annotated sequence information for newts severely compromises efforts to analyze changes in the transcriptional profile during regeneration. this is emphasized by a recent attempt to characterize transcriptional changes during nerve dependent limb regeneration. due to the low degree of sequence annotation, the combination of microarray and  <dig> sequencing analysis yielded only a limited number of new contigs after assembly of  <dig> cdna sequences with existing expressed sequence tags  even though the number of non-redundant human-a. mexicanum orthologous sequences was increased considerably  <cit> .

the size of the newt genome, archived on  <dig> chromosomes is estimated to be around  <dig> times larger than most mammalian genomes  <cit>  which impedes attempts to determine the complete genomic sequence. we therefore decided to concentrate on expressed sequences. this reduces the complexity of sequence information that needs to be analyzed but allows a comprehensive view on genes expressed during cardiac regeneration in the newt. in this study, we focused on newt hearts  <dig> days after damage, the time when highest cell proliferation during heart regeneration occurs  <cit> . we have assembled and annotated a large set of sequence data resulting in the identification of a group of potential open reading frames, which seem to be unique for urodele amphibians. furthermore, a web based relational database was constructed that combines sequence data and functional annotations. the database was used to compare transcriptional signatures of damaged hearts of newts and zebrafish, which is the only other known vertebrate capable of cardiac regeneration.

RESULTS
analysis of est quality and contig assembly
to obtain a comprehensive non-biased view of gene activity in regenerating newt hearts we constructed a non-normalized cdna library from damaged hearts  <dig> days after mechanical injury.  <dig>  randomly selected clones were picked and transferred into  <dig> well plates. we selected  <dig> clones for 5'end sequencing, which resulted in  <dig> high quality reads. after clipping of flanking vector sequences and long polya tails with a custom made software tool,  <dig> sequences which did not contain any cdna insert were removed. furthermore,  <dig> ests were discarded since they contained sequences shorter than  <dig> bp in length, thus yielding  <dig> est sequences of high quality . the majority of ests were in the range of 500- <dig> bp with a median size of  <dig> bp.  <dig> est reads  had a length of more than  <dig> bp . the quality of our sequence data with respect to read lengths and contig sizes was similar to previous est sequencing projects focusing on a. mexicanum  <cit> .

we assembled the  <dig> ests into  <dig> contigs with the commercial software seqman™ pro using default parameters. the average contig length was determined to be  <dig> bp. most contigs were in the range of  <dig> bp  in additional file 1). since the newt heart library was not normalized, we quantified the est distribution per contig to determine the redundancy level of our est dataset.  <dig> ests  were only present as singleton sequences, whilst  <dig> contigs  contained only two est clones, a ratio that is very similar to the est sequencing projects of a. mexicanum  <cit> . on average, the number of ests per contig was  <dig> , which confirmed the high diversity of our dataset.  <dig> contigs, assembled from  <dig> sequence reads, contained more than  <dig> ests , most probably representing transcripts with highest abundance at this stage of heart regeneration.

blast searches, homology assignment, and est annotation
to identify putative homologies to known nucleotide and protein sequences, we performed separate blastn, blastx and tblastx searches for the  <dig> assembled contigs in ncbi nr nucleotide and est databases.  <dig> contigs with a blast score of at least = 1e- <dig> were used for further analyses. according to the blast scores  <dig> contigs were categorized as weakly similar  and the remaining  <dig> contigs in significantly similar  to existing entries in the ncbi database . to further analyze which species showed the highest similarities for the individual contigs, we extracted blast hits with the smallest e-values from the different blast runs . not surprisingly,  <dig> % of all best hits were assigned to amphibians with the majority belonging to  <dig> identified salamander species, followed by  <dig> % of best hits for  <dig> different mammalian species and  <dig> % of best hits for  <dig> different avian species . most of the best hits corresponded to est sequences, which lack functional annotations or protein identities. however, blastx searches revealed significant similarities for many of these contigs to known protein entries in ncbi. thus, for submission to genbank all initial  <dig> contigs were split into their respective ests and deposited together with the information about the best hits  from all blast algorithms applied . all  <dig> est sequences were published in genbank on july  <dig>   <dig> under the accession numbers go <dig> to go935047

analysis of contig sequences
to identify contig sequences encoding full open reading frames we screened all blastx searches with a score ≤ 1e- <dig> for similarities that start within the first  <dig> amino acids of their putative protein homologues.  <dig> out of  <dig> contigs, which showed significant similarities before amino acid position  <dig>  also contained a polya tail.  <dig> contigs contained both the start codon and a 3'polya sequence suggesting that the complete open reading frame was covered .

 <dig> contigs, which show an alignment to their putative homologues before amino acid position  <dig>   <dig> contigs were found to encode a full-length cdna based on the presence of a putative initiation codon and a polya tail.

no assignable similarity to existing data base entries was obtained for  <dig> contigs . this ratio of  <dig> % was slightly higher compared to the a. mexicanum est sequencing project of habermann et al.  <cit>  , which might be due to the smaller number of ncbi database entries for n. viridescens compared to ncbi entries for ambystoma species. many contigs, which lacked an allocated blast hit to existing ncbi database entries, mapped to 3'untranslated regions, as determined with the software estscan  <cit> . however, a substantial proportion of these contigs  encoded open reading frames longer than  <dig> amino acids. in total,  <dig> contigs with orfs longer than  <dig> amino acids were identified . we reason that these contigs might represent proteins that are unique to urodele amphibians or correspond to proteins, which to date have not yet been identified in related organisms due to incomplete genomic information. however, we cannot exclude that the identified orfs represent parts of known proteins whose similarities are located in parts of the sequence that are not covered by the analyzed orfs.

the number of est clones which map to a certain contig will roughly reflect the relative abundance of corresponding mrnas since the cdna library from regenerating newt heart used in this study was not normalized. we found that  <dig> % of all ests were contained in  <dig> contigs, indicating that this group represented the most abundantly expressed genes in regenerating newt hearts  <dig> days after damage. in fact, the contigs with the largest number of est hits comprising  <dig> % of all ests, represented members of the globin family. the second largest group of ests  was derived from mitochondrial transcripts. members of the actin-myosin cytoskeleton represented  <dig> % of all sequenced inserts. another  <dig> % of all ests were classified as ribosomal proteins . the large number of est clones encoding globin mrnas was most likely caused by an incomplete removal of nucleated blood cells from regenerating hearts.

the four most abundant gene families of globins, mitochondrial encoded proteins, proteins associated to the actin-myosin cytoskeleton, and ribosomal proteins comprised  <dig> % of all ests represented by  <dig> contigs.

in order to subtract our dataset from contig sequences that are already available for n. viridescens in ncbi databases, we performed blast searches applying a cut-off value of ≤ e- <dig>  we identified a significant homology to  <dig> ncbi nr entries, which represented  <dig> different proteins.  <dig> out of these  <dig> proteins were encoded on the mitochondrial dna . most of the known n. viridescens ncbi entries were not covered by our est data set, which might be due to a low expression level and/or the different tissues from which the ests were derived. in summary, we were able to expand the existing set of unique ncbi sequence entries by more than  <dig> high quality annotated contigs, of which  <dig> sequences represented putative proteins that are potentially unique to urodele amphibians.

significant similarities to the newt est database were obtained for  <dig> entries from the ncbinr database. most contigs matched to mitochondrial-encoded proteins

functional annotation of assembled newt contigs to gene ontology terms
in order to achieve a functional annotation of assembled newt contigs we took advantage of protein identifiers deposited in the goa database. protein identifiers were retrieved by searching the trembl and swiss-prot databases using e-value ≤ e- <dig> and an abagyan score of > <dig>  <cit> . using this approach we assigned  <dig> contigs to existing go terms.  <dig> go terms were assigned to the domain "biological process",  <dig> go terms to "molecular function" and  <dig> go terms to "cellular component".  <dig> % of all functionally annotated proteins were most similar to the mammalian species human, mouse, rat and bovine,  <dig> % to fungal proteins,  <dig> % to insects, whilst  <dig> % displayed the highest similarity to miscellaneous eukaryotic organisms. only  <dig> % of all go annotated proteins were assigned to archaebacteria and bacteria .

50% of best hits matched to mammalian organisms. only  <dig> % of all best hits matched to insects, lower vertebrates, lower eukaryotic organisms, and bacteria.

comparison of transcriptional changes during newt and zebrafish heart regeneration
cardiac regeneration in vertebrates does not only occur in the newt n. viridescens but also in zebrafish  <cit> . the availability of affymetrix dna microarrays for zebrafish, which covers around  <dig> transcripts, allowed an analysis of the gene expression profile during zebrafish heart regeneration  <cit> . in this analysis  <dig> ests were found to change their expression level during heart regeneration. we wondered whether our newt cdna library, which was constructed from regenerating hearts, would cover corresponding sequences from zebrafish. to answer this question we integrated available zebrafish cdna sequences into a database. analysis of the database using the published affymetrix data allowed us to extract deregulated zebrafish transcripts, which we assembled into  <dig> different contigs. we next searched our newt est library with deregulated zebrafish sequences yielding  <dig> blast hits with an e-value < e- <dig>  of these hits,  <dig> individual newt contigs were identified, which showed a similarity to  <dig> zebrafish affy-ids . zebrafish and newts are evolutionary distant organisms. this compromises comparisons on the nucleotide level by blast and restricts identification of potential homologous protein sequences. furthermore, the transcriptomes of zebrafish and from newts are far from being complete. it is likely that est clones from newts and zebrafish, which encode for a specific homologous protein, will not match since the clones encode different non-overlapping parts of the cdna. to account for these difficulties we assigned protein identifiers to newt and zebrafish est clones after blastx searches on trembl and swiss-prot databases. in total,  <dig> zebrafish sequences were linked with a protein identifier.  <dig> proteins shared identical identifiers with proteins from our newt dataset, which were not detected previously by direct blast searches . using this approach we detected additional est clones coding for raldh <dig> in both newt and zebrafish data sets. raldh <dig> is a marker of activated epicardial cells that cover damaged myocardium after amputation and migrate actively into the regenerating myocardium  <cit> . applying both direct blast searches and comparison of protein identifiers we were able to identify similarities to  <dig> of the  <dig> deregulated zebrafish proteins. this indicates that a substantial number of the  <dig> annotated newt proteins may change expression levels during heart regeneration.

identifiers with best hits are listed with protein name, corresponding organism, and uniprotkb/swissprot entry. additional  <dig> proteins were identified using this approach.

to further investigate whether both organisms show similar changes in the gene expression program during heart regeneration we performed rt-pcr analyses of selected candidate genes categorized into  <dig> different gene expression clusters  according to lien et al  <dig>  <cit> .  <dig> genes of each selected cluster were chosen. expression levels were determined in newt hearts without injury and at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days after mechanical damage. for each time point analyzed,  <dig> biological sample pools, consisting of  <dig> newt hearts each were used. we found that muscle creatin kinase, hsp <dig> alpha and slc25a <dig>  which belong to cluster i, were down regulated by about 50% in newt hearts  <dig> days after damage. the expression was similar to control levels at day  <dig> and  <dig> after damage. in zebrafish these genes showed an extended down regulation  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days after amputation, which might be due to the more severe type of injury . genes of cluster iii  were up regulated  <dig> and  <dig> days after zebrafish ventricular amputation while the expression levels of corresponding newt sequences were not elevated at day  <dig> but increased from day  <dig> onwards until  <dig> days after damage. the delayed up-regulation of cluster iii genes in newts together with the extended increase of expression levels was clearly different from the situation in zebrafish . the genes for collagen typei alpha <dig>  similar to ferritin heavy chain and similar to cathepsin k  were up regulated at all stages of newt and zebrafish heart regeneration, albeit with different kinetics. in zebrafish, the highest levels occurred at earlier stages during development while this pattern was inversed in regenerating newt hearts . all expression changes of more than two fold were analyzed for statistical significance by paired students t-test and were found to be significant . the only exception was the expression of tubulin  <dig> alpha at  <dig> days after injury. taken together our analysis revealed a significant change in expression level of members of corresponding gene families in regenerating hearts of zebrafish and newt. the time course of expression, however, differed between both species, which might reflect species-specific differences or the different types of injuries, which were applied.

identification of biological pathways activated during zebrafish and newt heart regeneration by go annotation
so far the analysis indicated that our est dataset is enriched in sequences, which were modulated during newt heart regeneration, and that such sequences were also often expressed at different levels during regeneration of zebrafish hearts. we next asked whether we could identify common transcriptional pathways or signaling cascades, in which annotated newt proteins accumulate. we assumed that deregulated zebrafish ests represent a subset of genes, which mark regenerative processes. all newt and zebrafish proteins that were previously assigned to a go term within the root node "biological process"  were included in our search for genes involved in regeneration. we then selected a number of daughter nodes that cover processes, which are most likely involved in tissue regeneration. the following nodes were selected:  <dig> ) "embryonic or larval gene expression programs" since regeneration might require the re-initiation of early embryological processes which are needed to build tissues or organs.  <dig> ) " wound healing and cell migration", since the early phase of heart regeneration in zebrafish and newt involves recruitment and migration of inflammatory cells into the damaged tissue and other typical wound healing processes  <cit> .  <dig> ) "cell proliferation and cell death", since remodeling of damaged tissue requires proliferation of cells and removal of non-functional cell types within the damaged heart.  <dig> ) "cell differentiation, cell division and cell cycle", since new functional cells have to be generated by cellular differentiation of precursor cells that might originate from de-differentiated, reprogrammed cardiomyocytes  <cit>  or from stem cells residing within the heart  <cit> .  <dig> ) "circulation and growth of tissue", since epicardial cells migrate into the wound area of zebrafish hearts and contribute to the establishment of functional cardiac tissue by formation of microcapillaries  <cit> .  <dig> ) "muscle contraction", since reprogramming of existing newt cardiomyocytes results in down regulation of mature cardiomyocyte markers and expression of smooth muscle proteins  <cit> .  <dig> ) "cell surface receptor linked signal transduction and intracellular receptor mediated signaling pathways", since signaling events, which originate at the cell membrane, will contribute to the initiation and regulation of cardiac regeneration.

we first generated a tree diagram displaying all possible go term daughter nodes derived from the above selected ancestor terms using the freeware tool blast2go  <cit>  . next, proteins were directly annotated to their respective go nodes and then annotated to their connected parental nodes until the root biological process was reached. this allowed us to functionally connect proteins that are otherwise not assigned to the same specific go term.  <dig> protein identifiers were directly associated to  <dig> different go terms in newts . for the zebrafish dataset we associated  <dig> protein identifiers to  <dig> go terms . the largest number of protein identifiers  was related to a go term connected to development. a clear difference in protein numbers between newt and zebrafish was detected for the go ancestor term "intracellular receptor mediated signal", which is most probably due to relative small numbers of proteins associated with this term in the zebrafish dataset. interestingly, we did not detect any protein identifier for the ancestor term "antigen receptor-mediated signaling pathway" in zebrafish and only  <dig> proteins within the newt database suggesting that cellular immune response may be of minor relevance at these stages of heart regeneration.

the total number of proteins within a dataset that has been assigned to a given go term does not necessarily reflect the relative distribution of proteins between different terms, since the number of proteins that are covered by a given term might differ. therefore, we compared the total number of proteins annotated to the go term biological process to the total number of proteins in selected go term nodes. this procedure allowed us to determine the ratio of proteins annotated to the go term nodes go:0007275: development, go:0042060: wound healing, go:0016477:cell migration, go:0008283: cell proliferation, go:0008219: cell death, go:0030154: cell differentiation, go:0051301: cell division, go:0007049: cell cycle, go:0000278: mitotic cell cycle, go:0008015: circulation, go:0040007: growth, go:0006936: muscle contraction and go:0007166: cell surface receptor linked signal transduction. to verify an accumulation of proteins in a given ancestor term, we also compared the ratio of proteins annotated to a given go term to the total number of proteins available from the goa database, which was used as an unbiased standard dataset .

interestingly, we found a strong accumulation of proteins in some of the selected ancestor terms. a more than  <dig> fold accumulation was detected for "wound healing", "muscle contraction", and "circulation". the go terms "cell division", "cell death", "cell migration", "cell cycle", "mitotic cell cycle" and "cell proliferation" displayed a fold enrichment of at least  <dig>  for zebrafish and  <dig>  for newt with a minimum of  <dig> proteins annotated for zebrafish and  <dig> proteins annotated for newt. the terms "cell differentiation", "growth" "development", and "cell surface receptor linked signal transduction" showed an enrichment of less than  <dig> fold, which confirms our starting hypothesis that the total number of proteins, which can be linked to a go term, does not necessarily reflect the relative activity of genes within a term .

identification and analysis of genes associated with highly enriched go term sub nodes
since the determination of protein numbers accumulating within one of the above described ancestor terms only gives an estimate which general categories of a biological process were activated, we next determined the fold enrichment of proteins in all  <dig> go sub nodes for newt and all  <dig> go sub nodes for zebrafish. to demonstrate that this procedure allows identification of genes, which are not necessary homologous but linked to similar biological processes, we selected daughter nodes of go terms that contained at least  <dig> protein identifiers from zebrafish and  <dig> protein identifiers for newt . we detected an at least 10-fold enrichment for the following  <dig> go term nodes : m phase of mitotic cell cycle , mitosis , regulation of mitosis , mitotic sister chromatid segregation , and g2/m transition of mitotic cell cycle . the enrichment within these sub nodes indicated a dynamic regulation of the cell cycle during cardiac regeneration; anti-apoptosis , and autophagic cell death  suggesting a major role of the inhibition of programmed cell death and removal of dysfunctional cells during regeneration; muscle development , and muscle contraction  as expected for a dataset derived from contractile tissue; circulation , regulation of angiogenesis , and wound healing , which demonstrated the critical role of neoangiogenesis and wound repair during early heart regeneration.

to prove that enrichment analysis of go terms allows a more efficient identification of deregulated candidate genes that might be involved in the regeneration process rather than random selection, we performed statistical analysis for all  <dig> go terms from the newt dataset based on chi square test. in the course of the analysis we made a one-to-one comparison for the goa and newt datasets. the p-values represent the level of significance by which our observations are independent from each other. for the above-mentioned go terms, the detected enrichment was statistically significant .

to learn more about the expression kinetics of individual genes which were present in highly enriched go terms , we performed a rt-pcr analysis using tissues from hearts isolated at four different time points during heart regeneration. four genes were selected that were both identified in newt and zebrafish hearts:  <dig> ) karyopherin or importin alpha <dig> , which is involved in the first step of nuclear protein import and is believed to be regulated in a cell cycle dependent manner  <cit> . karyopherin is regulated by tgf beta <dig> and ifn-gamma mediated signaling  <cit>  amongst many other pathways.  <dig> ) survivin , which is member of a family of inhibitors of apoptosis and functions as a key regulator of mitotic cell cycle and programmed cell death  <cit> . survivin is a target of the pi3k/akt pathway  <cit>  and interacts in a cell cycle dependent manner with the small gtpase ran  <cit> .  <dig> ) clusterin , which is a glycoprotein expressed as an intracellular isoform, and as a secreted protein. the nuclear form of clusterin  is pro-apoptotic while the secretory form  has a pro-survival role  <cit> . clusterin has been implicated in various cell functions involved in carcinogenesis and tumor progression  <cit> .  <dig> ) cyclophilin a , which is a member of the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase  family involved in cyclosporin a mediated immunosuppression  <cit> . in h <dig> lung cancer cells, down regulation of cyclophilin a prevents up regulation of cyclin d <dig> and cdk <dig> expression for subsequent cell cycle progression  <cit> . the expression level of all  <dig> selected genes differed from normal hearts at all  <dig> time points analyzed. the highest expression was detected at  <dig> days after injury. an almost two fold change was detected for survivin, which was down regulated to less than 60% of normal levels  <dig> days after newt heart damage, although changes in expression levels were statistically not significant . the expression of survivin in zebrafish was up regulated with expression levels that were highest at  <dig> and  <dig> days after amputation. this illustrates differences during newt and zebrafish heart regeneration despite multiple similarities.

to ask whether our go term based functional screen is able to identify additional transcripts that may change their expression level during newt heart regeneration, we selected candidate proteins from go terms, which showed a more than  <dig> fold accumulation ratio. candidates were chosen which either did not undergo a change in expression levels during zebrafish heart regeneration or which were not present on zebrafish affymetrix arrays. for transcripts associated to "cell cycle regulation" we included the gtp-binding nuclear protein ran, which is required for nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of proteins and control of dna synthesis and cell cycle progression  <cit> . ran directly interacts with survivin in a cell cycle dependent manner  <cit> . ring-box protein  <dig>  a component of the scf  and the cbc   e <dig> ubiquitin ligase complexes mediates ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins involved in cell cycle progression  <cit> . thioredoxin-like protein 4b , which is required for cell cycle progression at the s/g transition and is associated to proteins involved in pre-mrna splicing  <cit> . dead/h box protein  <dig> , a dna helicase required for sister chromatid cohesion  <cit> . chlr <dig> is essential for embryonic development and the prevention of aneuploidy  <cit> . s-phase kinase-associated protein  <dig>  an essential component of the scf  ubiquitin ligase complex  <cit> , which mediates the ubiquitination of proteins involved in cell cycle progression. fission yeast skp <dig> is required for spindle morphology and nuclear membrane segregation at anaphase  <cit> . aurora kinase a-interacting protein , a negative regulator of aurora-a kinase  <cit> , that modulates the stability of its interaction partner aurora-a kinase in conjunction with gsk-3beta  <cit> , as well as centrin  <dig> and  <dig>  involved in centrosome reproduction  <cit> . additionally, we selected transcripts assigned to negative regulation of apoptosis. translational-controlled tumor protein , a multifunctional protein with potent antiapoptotic capabilities  <cit>  that is essential for mouse embryonic development  <cit> . secreted frizzled-related protein  <dig> , which functions as a modulator of wnt signaling through direct interaction with wnts  <cit> . ring finger protein  <dig>  a component of the scf  e <dig> ubiquitin ligase complex, which mediates ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins involved in cell cycle progression, signal transduction and transcription  <cit> . high mobility group box protein b <dig>  which functions as an intracellular regulator of transcription and is also released as a cytokine by necrotic and inflammatory cells  <cit> . hmgb- <dig> is implicated to be critically involved in skeletal muscle  <cit> , as well as cardiac regeneration  <cit> . cofilin  <dig>  an actin depolymerizing protein, implicated in congenital nemaline myopathy   <cit> . pp1beta, potentially involved in cell cycle control and apoptosis  <cit>  and ywhaz , which possibly modulates reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton via binding to cofilin and limk <dig>  <cit> . from a third group of transcripts functionally annotated to muscle development, we chose muscle lim protein , which is critically involved in cardiomyocyte architecture, as revealed by targeted knockout  <cit> . muscle lim protein acts as a stress sensor, linked to calcineurin-nfat signaling at the sarcomeric z-disk  <cit>  and interferon-related developmental regulator  <dig> , a multifunctional transcriptional regulator, that is directly interacting with p <dig>  regulating its function  <cit>  and is also required for myoblast differentiation  <cit> .

to detect transcriptional changes during newt heart regeneration, we performed rt-pcr analysis for the selected candidates as described above. although most candidate genes did not show major changes in expression, we monitored a more than  <dig> fold change in the levels of rnf  <dig>  sfrp  <dig>  thioredoxin-like protein 4b and tctp  <dig> during newt heart regeneration . these changes were statistically significant for rnf  <dig> and sfrp  <dig> at  <dig> and  <dig> days after injury and  <dig> and  <dig> days after injury for thioredoxin-like protein 4b . we concluded that our functional annotation based screen identified dynamically regulated candidate genes that have not been implicated in cardiac regeneration before. although a functional analysis is pending, the changes in the expression of cell cycle control genes and of regulators of programmed cell death suggest an important role of these processes for newt heart regeneration.

CONCLUSIONS
we have described the generation of a large est dataset from regenerating newt hearts. this will facilitate the molecular analysis of heart regeneration. together with existing est data from other urodeles such as amybystoma mexicanum, our est dataset might also help to uncover general principles of tissue regeneration in urodele amphibians. careful analysis of our data allowed insights into the transcriptional program that governs heart regeneration in newts and revealed multiple changes in different biological processes ranging from the regulation of programmed cell death to cell cycle regulation and wound repair. comparison to sequences, which are deregulated during zebrafish heart regeneration, revealed similarities but also differences during cardiac regeneration in both species.

the fundamental differences between mammals and newts in tissue regeneration argue for involvement of multiple mechanisms directing complex processes ranging from wound repair, regulation of the extracellular matrix, and cell cycle control, to proliferation and differentiation, which need to be precisely controlled to allow successful organ regeneration. only integrated approaches that take advantage of the analysis of large data sets will eventually lead to a thorough understanding of tissue regeneration. an important part of such analysis is the comparison between organisms capable of comprehensive organ regeneration and those, which have lost  this ability. so far the mammalian heart has proven to be resistant to tissue regeneration despite numerous attempts to rebuild lost tissue including cell transplantation and activation of potential regenerative pathways. it seems reasonable to assume that analysis of transcriptional changes, which occur in organisms capable of regeneration, might disclose the critical processes that are indispensable for the replacement of functional heart tissue. we reason that in-depth knowledge of differences that occur in response to tissue damage between regenerating and non-regenerating organisms might pave the way to manipulate and improve regenerative responses. eventually, evolutionarily imposed restrictions to cardiac regeneration might be lifted, in particular if such restrictions are species-specific. the acquisition of sequence data, which reflect transcriptional changes during newt heart regeneration, is a first step in this direction.
