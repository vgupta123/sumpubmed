BACKGROUND
there is now an extensive literature on the phylogeographic structure of many european freshwater fish species, and these studies often relate to shifting hydrological river networks over several pleistocene glacial cycles or dating even back into the pliocene or miocene epochs  <cit> . knowledge of broad-scale phylogeographic structure relating to historical geomorphological processes provides us with an evolutionary framework that can support finer-scaled studies directed toward the understanding of speciation processes as well as potential population responses to future climatic changes  <cit> . such studies on freshwater systems are now extending into the marine environment, where factors affecting phyogeographic patterns such as ocean currents and larvae dispersal are discussed. far less attention has been given to the biologically relevant dynamics of the historical landscape for anadromous fishes  <cit> , which are invariably more complex as they involve both freshwater and marine environments.

the combined effects of tectonic and climatic processes promotes abrupt sea level changes that alter ocean or sea interconnections, large-scale current patterns, salinity and temperature gradients, as well as water column stratification  <cit> . in europe such processes can lead to dramatic extinction events such as those experienced in the late miocene during the messinian salinity crisis, which resulted in a near drying of the mediterranean due to volcanic and tectonic uplift near the strait of gibraltar  <cit> . more generally, broad-scale isolation mechanisms lead to multi-species phylogeographic breaks such as that found between the mediterranean and atlantic basins caused by the strait of gibraltar and the complex currents of the almeria-oran front. such breaks have led not only to genetic structure within species but also to levels of reciprocal endemism between these major ocean basins  <cit> . unlike many purely marine species, whose dispersal is strongly influenced by oceanic currents experienced in the early-life history stages   <cit> , dispersal of anadromous species is mainly dependent on adult migration into estuaries and river courses. as such environments in europe are heavily affected by a wide range of human-related alterations and exploitation pressures  <cit> , the conservation of many anadromous fish populations presents a very difficult challenge.

shads of genus alosa comprise  <dig> species that are primarily anadromous representatives of the family clupeidae, one of the world’s most commercially important fish families  <cit> . the two european species, a. alosa and a. fallax, exhibit largely overlapping ranges in the northeastern atlantic, which use to extend from iceland in the north to morocco in the south . however, human-mediated disturbances  have resulted in a drastic reduction of their range, especially for a. alosa, which is now mainly confined to some iberian and french atlantic rivers  <cit> . while a. fallax was also described in at least one black sea tributary and is found throughout the mediterranean, a. alosa is now presumably extinct from the rivers draining into this almost enclosed sea , though previously reported in ebro , rhone  and moulouya . a high diversity of alosa species is found within the ponto-caspio region, with three species described for the black sea ; one endemic species  described for lake volvi, a greek freshwater lake; and five species  described for the caspian sea. thus, these species occur across oceanic biogeographic regions where abiotic factors such as currents, salinity and temperature continuously change allowing episodes of long-distance dispersal, gene flow and alternatively isolation .

despite their biological interest as a model to study the main factors involved in diversification in the region, their phylogenetic relationships have not yet been completely clarified  <cit>  and little is known about the geographic distribution of their genetic variability  <cit> . in particular, given the limited number of samples analyzed per species in phylogenetic studies  <cit> , it is not clear if the monophyletic status of european shad species will be maintained with increased geographic sampling coverage. moreover, despite the identification of significant genetic differentiation between populations, mainly among a. fallax populations, some studies have a very regional focus  <cit> , while others are based on genetic markers with limited variability for drawing broad geographic-scale conclusions , highlighting the need for a comprehensive phylogeographic study.

hybridization among european shad species is well documented , with levels of introgression varying widely among the populations thus far investigated  <cit> . nonetheless, in all locations where species are found in sympatry, taxa remain largely distinct reflecting a degree of resilience to the formation of hybrid swarms and partial barriers to introgression. understanding cladogenesis, ecological divergence and varying degrees of reproductive isolation despite gene flow  remains a major challenge for evolutionary geneticists and thus shads in the atlantic-mediterranean region provide a unique model for population genetic studies of these processes.

in order to obtain a better understanding of the roles of historical events and demographic processes in shaping genetic diversity of european alosa we carried out the first comprehensive comparative phylogeographic analysis of these species. we were particularly interested in: i) re-evaluating the genetic relationships among alosa species; ii) testing if shared mtdna haplotypes between a. alosa and a. fallax result from introgression or incomplete lineage sorting; iii) understanding how genetic variability is distributed among the eastern atlantic and mediterranean basins, as well as inferring the major phylogeographic barriers to gene flow that may have been responsible for promoting differentiation; and, iv) understanding the impact of major pleistocene climatic changes on the genetic composition and historical demography of a. alosa and a. fallax populations from different geographic regions. this study focuses on historical patterns and processes, but the inferences can contribute to the improvement of conservation measures in the future, as the species confront both natural and man-made ecosystem alterations.

RESULTS
dna sequence variation, phylogenetic relationships and divergence time between eurasian shads
the final alignment yielded  <dig> bp for cyt b  and  <dig> bp for nd <dig> , with no indels or stop codons, after removing the terminal stop codon for nd <dig>  in  <dig> a. fallax individuals, more than one haplotype was observed within a single individual, corresponding to common haplotypes in our database. as the occurrence of heteroplasmy was reported previously in alosa <cit> , for simplicity, we excluded this low percentage  of putative heteroplasmic individuals from further analyses.

there were a total of  <dig> variable positions,  <dig> of which were parsimony informative defining a total of  <dig> haplotypes:  <dig> found in a. alosa and  <dig> in a. fallax individuals, from which  <dig> are shared among the two species. maximum parsimony  analysis revealed  <dig> equally parsimonious trees of  <dig> steps . the best-fit model was trn + i + g with an estimate of invariable sites  and a discrete approximation of the gamma distribution . as similar topologies were obtained with all methods only the mp and bayesian trees are shown . the monophyly of all eurasian alosa is very well supported by the mtdna fragments here analyzed. notwithstanding the observation of shared haplotypes between a. alosa and a. fallax , a very well supported clade is formed by a. alosa haplotypes, while a. fallax and black sea species complex  taxa form a large diverse clade with low support , as previously shown  <cit> . excluding introgressed individuals, three subgroups of a. alosa haplotypes each form well-supported clades, while the support for three subclades of a. fallax haplotypes and the primary clade  of bsc was generally lower, except for the bayesian analysis, where posterior probability is generally equal to  <dig>  . divergence time between a. alosa and other major clades of eurasian shads  ranges from  <dig>  to  <dig>  myrs , being lower between a. fallax and the bsc  . two clades are observed within the black sea  . within both a. alosa and a. fallax, the three main well-supported clades started to diverge between  <dig>  and  <dig>  myrs ago; and between  <dig>  and  <dig>  myrs ago, respectively . importantly, intraspecific divergence  is always lower than interspecific divergence .

dxy, mean pairwise divergence between groups; da, net nucleotide divergence between groups; black sea represents all haplotypes found in the bsc complex, including bs <dig>  estimates using different divergence rates  are presented.

the posterior distribution of the divergence time between a. alosa and a. fallax obtained with ima <dig> did not show a well-defined peak, suggesting that there is not enough information in the data to confidently infer this parameter . nonetheless, the bins with higher posterior probabilities correspond to a divergence time of around  <dig>  myrs , which is very close to the estimate based on the amount of sequence divergence .

introgressive hybridization between a. alosa and a. fallax
in three out of nine a. alosa populations analyzed, we found a. fallax haplotypes, and in  <dig> of the  <dig> populations of a. fallax we found varying percentages of a. alosa haplotypes, with relatively high levels  in populations from the united kingdom  and portugal  . coalescent-based ima <dig> analysis detected statistically significant gene flow between the two species in both directions . although effective migration is slightly higher into a. alosa than into a. fallax, the confidence intervals overlap considerably .

in the remaining populations no introgression was observed.

*individuals from severn and its tributary, the teme, were pooled.

intraspecific phylogeographic network description
for a. fallax, the  <dig> haplotypes across all three clades span a total of  <dig> substitutions . one group of haplotypes  is distributed throughout the atlantic north of morocco . within this group, a large star-like cluster of haplotypes is centered on the most common haplotype  found throughout the atlantic, north of the mira river in portugal . a second small star-like cluster of haplotypes is closely related to the large cluster, representing haplotypes common to portuguese rivers. a second large diverse group of haplotypes  is a minimum of four substitutions divergent from all other haplotypes and represents populations distributed throughout the mediterranean basin, although the two most common haplotypes  were also found in atlantic populations, with af <dig> found as far north as denmark . two additional haplotypes  are a minimum of eight substitutions divergent from all others. one of these haplotypes is fixed in morocco and widely distributed in portugal , while the other  was only detected in the guadiana river. an additional divergent haplotype  was found in the tejo river, portugal . some haplotypes were found in a single river or confined to a restricted geographic region  .

codes for populations and haplotypes are the same as in table  <dig>  as well as in the different figures.

for a. alosa,  <dig> haplotypes across the three clades span a maximum of  <dig> substitutions whereby one star-like cluster  centers on the most common and widespread haplotype  found in nearly all populations . clade  <dig> is separated by a minimum of seven substitutions from the four remaining haplotypes, which are dispersed over two groups, one mainly located in the northern atlantic , and the second  represented by primarily low-frequency haplotypes with no apparent phylogeographic pattern . the guadiana river was fixed for a unique haplotype, while lima river exhibited a total of six haplotypes whereas four of them were found in single individuals  .

codes for populations and haplotypes are the same as in table  <dig>  as well as in the different figures.

population substructure
within population variation explained the majority of the genetic variance in both european shad species  . nonetheless, among population variance was significant in a. fallax  but not in a. alosa . levels of differentiation within the mediterranean basin for a. fallax were higher than in the atlantic . for a. fallax the 3-level amova revealed significant structure between the atlantic, morocco and mediterranean population groups . a samova considering k =  <dig> showed that this clustering indeed maximized Φct , supporting our grouping for the amova structure analysis.

* populations were clustered in three main groups: atlantic ; mediterranean; and morocco. ap, among populations; ag, among groups; apwg, among populations within groups; wp, within populations.

divergence time between the atlantic and mediterranean groups of populations estimated based on an isolation-with-migration model dates to  <dig>  myrs ago . although a 95% hpd upper bound could not be computed for the coalescent-based estimates of divergence time , the values obtained are very close to the interval of divergence time based on sequence divergence  . shared haplotypes between atlantic and mediterranean populations were observed, as well as between atlantic populations and morocco . coalescent-based estimates of migration between the former pair of populations identified significant migration from mediterranean into the atlantic coasts of europe but not the reverse  .

intraspecific variation and demographic history
both haplotype and nucleotide diversities, as well as observed theta are higher for a. fallax  compared to a. alosa  . accordingly, the coalescent-based ima <dig> estimate of the effective population size of a. alosa is considerably lower than observed for a. fallax  with non-overlapping confidence intervals . the posterior distribution of the ancestral population size is very flat, with a very wide likelihood-based confidence interval.

within a. fallax, clade  <dig>  showed higher levels of both nucleotide and haplotype diversity compared to clade  <dig>  . however, both theta and the coalescent-based ima <dig> estimates of the effective population size of clade  <dig> are considerably higher than observed for clade  <dig>  . within the atlantic basin, both a. fallax and a. alosa revealed higher diversity levels in the iberian peninsula region compared to the north atlantic . within a. fallax, a demographic expansion was supported for clade  <dig>  and clade  <dig>  starting about  <dig>  and  <dig>  yrs ago, respectively . within a. alosa clades, growth was supported only for clade  <dig>  beginning about  <dig>  yrs ago . despite the large confidence intervals, the bayesian skyride analysis confirms a general tendency for population growth for these same clades during the last  <dig>  years, with exception of the last thousand years. although the time since expansion estimates based on the bayesian skyride and on the one-time sudden exponential growth model analyses  are not completely coincident, we observe a similar trend: in a. fallax, effective population size started to increase earlier in clade  <dig>  than in clade  <dig> .

discussion
eurasian shad diversification
our analysis provides strong support for the monophyly of eurasian shads yet weak support for the internal branching order of major european lineages, as previously shown with a far more limited data set  <cit> . the lack of resolution for the relationships among major lineages presumably reflects relatively rapid radiation during the pleistocene  but whole mtdna genome data or an extensive nuclear gene data set might still provide more resolution. even the question of the sister species status of a. alosa and a. fallax <cit>  cannot be unequivocally answered due to the very weak node support of the clade grouping a. fallax and bsc haplotypes . however, divergence estimates  favor a considerably closer relationship of a. fallax to the bsc than to a. alosa.

for estimated divergence times among lineages we rely on a credible but rough divergence rate of 2% /myrs for the whole mtdna, though we provide inferences based on a range from 1-4%/myrs . rates such as 1%/myrs are very unlikely as this would result in estimates of demographic expansion in the atlantic  ca. 25– <dig> thousand years ago, which is at the height of the last glacial maximum  . rates of 3%/myrs have been convincingly shown for the genus coregonus <cit>  whereby their calibration is based on a more recent split, and there is mounting evidence that there is a time-decay phenomenon for mtdna divergence rates due to the delayed efficiency of purifying selection within a phylogeny  <cit> . moreover, there is little evidence for considerably higher rates of divergence for temperate freshwater fishes . thus, we limit our discussions to inferences based on a 2%/myrs divergence rate, but emphasize that the relative as opposed to the absolute dating of events among lineages is more credible.

using this framework, some general inferences can be drawn concerning the diversification of european alosa lineages. first, all species or clade splits are confined to the pleistocene implying that these cold-tolerant taxa proliferated or radiated during glacier-mediated climatic oscillations and not during pre-pleistocene  climatic conditions, which were considerably warmer  <cit> , or perhaps even unsuitable for alosa in the region under study. second, all species or clade splits occurred over time periods older than the lgm and thus this most recent glacial cycle had little to nothing to do with the origin of major lineages. the divergence between a. fallax and the black sea lineages started roughly  <dig>  to  <dig>  myrs ago. we speculate that a radiation occurred during this period when connections between the mediterranean and black seas  took place  <cit> , allowing the eastern expansion of alosa into the black and caspian seas. these connections were subsequently interrupted several times , promoting isolation and differentiation, providing a clearer biogeographic break, which has presumably played a role in promoting cladogenesis  <cit> . similar to the communication between the mediterranean and atlantic basins, however, there is presently no absolute barrier between the mediterranean and black seas. the present connection occurs over a salinity gradient along the dardanelles channel, which connects the aegean and marmara seas and has bottom salinities similar to the mediterranean. the marmara sea is then connected to the black sea via the bosporus strait, whose total saline input into the black sea combined with the present freshwater inputs results in an approximately  <dig>  to  <dig> ppt surface water salinity  <cit> . this raises the question of whether the observed cladogenesis and speciation in the genus alosa in this region is primarily promoted through allopatry stemming from phases of geographic isolation during reduced mediterranean sea levels, or simply the starkly differing environmental conditions , as suggested for other species in the ponto-caspio region  <cit> .

salinity gradients or breaks have clearly played a role in the diversification of the genus alosa. several landlocked populations of alosa complete their entire life cycle in freshwater and differ in terms of morphology, genetics and physiology from nearby anadromous populations  <cit> . a. macedonica, endemic to freshwater lake volvi in greece, is one such example. freshwater lakes of this region were presumably colonized with alosa immigrating from a low salinity phase of the black sea during one of its spills into the aegean sea  <cit> . alosa colonized two lakes on the greek peninsula , whereby the lake vistonis lineage has apparently gone extinct due perhaps to human-caused salt water intrusion  <cit> . alosa from lake volvi is considered a distinct species carrying out its entire life cycle in freshwater, whereas the aegean sea region, now with higher salinity harbors only a. fallax of mediterranean origin.

interspecific gene flow versus ancestral polymorphism
while ancestral polymorphism could in theory explain shared haplotypes between the two species, the evidence for hybridization and introgression is overwhelming, in agreement with previous published studies  <cit> . the occurrence of apparent hybrids is not geographically homogeneous, with certain rivers showing high and others low frequencies. this alone is suggestive of hybridization in contrast to ancestral polymorphism, which should show little geographic pattern. however, given the anadromy and natal site fidelity of the species, such observations are not 100% conclusive.

coalescent-based estimates under a model of isolation-with-migration support gene flow between a. alosa and a. fallax. strong population substructure or complex demographic scenarios may provide violations of model assumptions. however, several lines of argument strongly support that introgression is occurring between the two species. first, it has been shown that migration estimates based on isolation-with-migration models are robust to population structure and departures from simple demographic scenarios  <cit> . second, the occurrence of morphological hybrids between these species has been widely documented  <cit> . and finally, previous studies showed a correlation between genotypes based on nuclear markers and gill raker counts, with the hybrids presenting intermediate morphological and genetic compositions, strongly supporting the occurrence of hybridization  <cit> .

interestingly, the levels of introgression are particularly high in a. fallax populations of usk and tywi , although a. alosa basically disappeared from this region  <cit> . these results are concordant with the higher mtdna introgression levels previously found in these same rivers  <cit> . the interpretation of these results under a wider geographic perspective suggests that hybridization between a. alosa and a. fallax varies among river basins from  <dig> to 63%, reaching a maximum in tywi . the causes of different levels of introgression among river basins are unknown but might be related to either differing degrees of anthropogenic disturbance, mainly the construction of migration obstacles such dams and weirs  <cit> , and/or innate differences relating to behavior or genetic composition. whether natural or anthropogenically induced, changing environmental conditions have long been thought to play a major role in increasing rates of hybridization in fishes  <cit> . several recent freshwater fish studies  <cit>  underscore the importance of broader ecological degradation leading to increased hybridization rates, a situation which easily applies to the uk and portuguese rivers where high levels of hybridization are documented. nevertheless, shads represent a very unique case of introgressive hybridization among european fishes, something that needs to be further addressed using also nuclear markers.

geographic distribution of intraspecific genetic variability
phylogeographic structure within a. fallax revealed by amova and samova clearly relates to the major basins , but also to smaller-scale patterns evidenced by regionally specific haplotypes. therefore, it appears that differentiation was mainly shaped by historical processes of fragmentation between the mediterranean and the atlantic as described for many other species , but also by regional barriers within these oceanographic regions. the divergence time estimates between the main clades marking the divide between the mediterranean and the atlantic a. fallax populations  suggest that separation occurred after the mindel glaciations, when a hypothetical ancestral population expanded its range through the three regions, allowing subsequent divergence. however, we do not know with certainty if fragmentation was caused by sea level drop during glacial maximums, shifting marine currents, or adaptation to different environmental conditions existing between the two basins. thus, at least for a. fallax, the strait of gibraltar or a nearby region  act in restricting gene flow between the mediterranean and atlantic, as described for many other species  <cit> . this barrier may not be absolute for a. fallax, considering the existence of shared haplotypes  between the two basins and the coalescent-based migration estimates, with significant gene flow from the mediterranean into the atlantic . a simulation study testing the violations to isolation-with-migration models showed that gene flow with a third population, can inflate migration and effective population size estimates  <cit> . however, our estimates remained significant even when we corrected for this possibility , namely migration between morocco and european atlantic coast, suggesting that a. fallax migration from the mediterranean into the atlantic inferred using mtdna is indeed real. although migration over long distances through the straits of gibraltar is possible, we cannot exclude alternative possibilities associated with past connection between headwater captures of mediterranean and atlantic draining rivers, migration through artificial canals, or non-documented human-mediated transport related with stocking. nonetheless, as no a. fallax haplotypes typical for the atlantic region have been thus far found in the mediterranean and a. alosa is currently limited to the atlantic basin, it would appear as if the atlantic-mediterranean corridor is at least a contemporary isolating mechanism for these species.

the geographic origin of clade  <dig> in a. fallax is not clear. the fact that it reaches higher frequencies in the southern atlantic populations from morocco and guadiana suggests an african or southern iberian origin. however, the lack of variability in the southern most population  is puzzling. huge population declines and possible local extinction has been suggested for a. fallax in morocco  <cit> , which could have resulted in a depletion of variability on that region. however, further studies using nuclear markers and samples from other african populations  are needed to evaluate this hypothesis and to elucidate about the putative origin of clade  <dig> 

at a smaller geographic scale, significant population structure  supported by the existence of fixed or regionally restricted haplotypes is observed in a. fallax . this pattern is especially evident in the mediterranean, where the existence of relatively frequent haplotypes restricted to some regions  explain the higher differentiation found in this oceanographic region compared with the atlantic . this can either suggest a higher fidelity in terms of homing behavior of the a. fallax populations inhabiting the mediterranean or a longer history of isolation accompanied by a more demographic stability of these populations. however, this is difficult to evaluate with the present data set, as the system of rivers draining to each of these oceanographic regions is not easily comparable.

genetic variation of alosa in the atlantic basin shows both concordance between the two species, with respect to the haplotype networks, as well as strong differences in overall diversity and phylogeographic structure. in both species, three similarly divergent clades are present, most likely reflecting evolution in the same refugia during glacial maxima. despite the fact that a. alosa displays little phylogeographic structure compared to a. fallax , clades as a whole are broadly spread throughout the atlantic basin in both species, where they co-exist . this pattern implies a concordant history of both species presumably due to the same climatic events and the same long-term refugia, yet differing in post-glacial demography and/or ecological responses to climatic amelioration . a. alosa has a considerably more limited distribution and spawns much higher in the river systems than a. fallax, an obviously more demanding ecological niche, through periods of natural hydrological instability and glacial advance as well as in more contemporary times due to numerous anthropogenically caused interruptions in river corridors. consequently, the task of inferring the geographic origin of the three main clades observed for a. alosa is comparatively much more challenging, as the species disappeared from some of the putative candidate regions . future studies should thus make use of existing material  and of a. alosa haplotypes “available” in populations of a. fallax through introgression, prior the local extinction of a. alosa, to identify the geographic origin of the clades identified here.

demographic responses to pleistocene climate
interestingly, although the two species share parallel intraspecific clade structures supporting parallel refugia, mtdna haplotype diversity of a. alosa is much lower than for a. fallax. the rapidly declining range of a. alosa, including its disappearance from the mediterranean basin and northern africa can explain the differences found between the two species  <cit> , and have perhaps permanently clouded any trace of its evolutionary origins in geographic terms.

the demographic responses detected in our analysis were largely lineage specific, most likely reflecting relatively large-scale environmental changes. assuming a neutral or nearly-neutral evolution of the mtdna molecule, strong statistical support for post-glacial growth was seen for both a. alosa and a. fallax lineages in the atlantic basin, with roughly similar age estimates, presumably reflecting expansion after the lgm . reproductive migrations of a. fallax are thought to be inhibited by water temperatures below 11°c  <cit>  implying that this species must have been purged from, or at least drastically reduced in the north atlantic during the lgm. however, not only present, but also historical effective population sizes of a. fallax may have been larger than for a. alosa. this may suggest that even before anthropogenically caused environmental changes a. alosa had a more limited capacity to survive climatic oscillations. however, we cannot exclude that a population of a. alosa may have survived in the north atlantic, where haplotypes of clade  <dig> are more frequent , a hypothesis that needs to be tested in the future with nuclear data. regardless of the refugia location, it appears that the refugial populations of a. alosa have only carried limited mtdna haplotype diversity at our level of resolution compared to a. fallax, which seems to have experienced more stable conditions along the iberian coast compared to the north atlantic.

demographic growth in a. fallax  seems to have started earlier in the mediterranean than in the atlantic , suggesting either a faster amelioration or the maintenance of adequate environmental conditions in the mediterranean during the last glacial period , allowing the permanence of stable populations of a. fallax in the region. the actual rarity of alosa on the southern shores of the mediterranean probably reflects that the present day sub-tropical temperatures are far from optimal for this species. in general, for both a. alosa and a. fallax, the contemporary southern limit of their distributions appears to reflect marginal habitat conditions, due to warm temperatures. during the last century, the occurrence of a. alosa along the mediterranean was mainly reported for the coast of the iberian peninsula and france, where a. fallax is presently abundant. the fact that this region exhibits the coolest water temperatures along the entire mediterranean basin  <cit>  further supports our hypothesis.

the distribution of the genetic diversity of european alosa species throughout the atlantic, in particular of a. fallax , suggests that a southern refuge existed along the iberian peninsula , similar to that reported for many other species . however, contrary to what has been suggested for other anadromous fishes with atlantic distribution, namely the cold-tolerant species atlantic salmon s. salar <cit>  and brown trout s. trutta <cit>   for which glacial refugia in northern europe have been suggested, alosa northern populations seem to have been directly affected by the advance of ice sheets, as suggested by the low nucleotide diversity observed in these populations, when only the haplotypes of the clade with a putative atlantic origin  are considered. thus, alosa’s comparative cold-intolerance may limit the potential range of glacial refugia in the atlantic, which, together with the fact that contemporary climatic conditions appear to be causing problems for the species at the southern limit of their distribution, underscores, especially for a. alosa, the sensitivity of these species to climatic change. in contrast to the atlantic, the mediterranean seems to provide more long-term stable habitat for lineages of alosa during colder periods, but the opposite may also be true during interglacials, as suggested by the recent disappearance of a. alosa and the distribution of a. fallax throughout the region, with lower abundance in areas with higher seawater temperature.

CONCLUSIONS
the geographically extensive sampling implemented in this study allowed us to shed light on the present day and historical distribution of eurasian shad’s genetic diversity, providing a necessary framework upon which different evolutionary hypotheses can be further tested. alosa alosa and a. fallax mtdna haplotypes from different geographic locations cluster in two major lineages that roughly correspond to the two species, suggesting a unique event of diversification and subsequent colonization of different river basins. the observation of gene flow between these two species, which differs in intensity and directionality among geographic locations, suggest that the genomic architecture underlying pre- and/or post-zygotic barriers may differ geographically. although we cannot neglect that these inferences were drawn based on a single locus, they provide fundamental information for new research projects. further studies on eurasian shads should focus on multiple molecular markers and on particular ecological features, in order to evaluate the nature of putative reproductive barriers between these species in different river systems where they coexist. moreover it will be important to identify genomic regions impermeable to gene flow in order to understand the building up of the genetic basis of reproductive isolation. the repeated contact between these lineages across different river systems offers a unique set of replicated experiments for evaluating reproductive barriers and to test speciation mechanisms.

the high population differentiation of a. fallax populations, especially in the mediterranean suggest a complex evolutionary history but also constitute an interesting region to study the genetic basis of adaptation to high water temperatures and salinity. this implies that a conservation perspective to the taxonomic diversity in this region should be more sensitive to other potential population differences .

despite the similar haplotype network topologies between a. alosa and a. fallax, suggesting a common intraspecific evolutionary history, their different demographic histories, present day distribution ranges, and spawning niche differentiation reflect different ecological needs and responses to natural or human-mediated climatic changes. shads are clearly relatively vulnerable taxa due to their dependence on major river systems, which are some of the most heavily impacted habitats in europe. their responses to the remarkable flow and sea level changes experienced naturally in the past may become even more dramatic due to the additive effects of current human activities. the differences observed between these two species in terms of the genetic diversity must be considered by management actions to insure the maintenance of their declining populations.
