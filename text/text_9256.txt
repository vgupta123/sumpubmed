BACKGROUND
neurotransmission underlies cognition and behavior, and when disturbed leads to changes in these functional parameters  <cit> . the polyunsaturated fatty acids , docosahexaenoic acid  and arachidonic acid  are important second messengers in brain, where they participate in neurotransmission  <cit> . agonist binding to certain neuroreceptors can release aa or dha from the stereospecifically numbered- <dig>  position of membrane phospholipids via activation of aa-selective group iva calcium-dependent cytosolic phospholipase a <dig>  or dha-selective group via calcium-independent phospholipase a <dig>   <cit> . cpla <dig> and ipla <dig> are post-synaptically located  <cit> .

in the intact brain and in vitro, aa-preferring cpla <dig> type iva has been shown to be coupled to serotonergic 5-ht2a/2c receptors  <cit> , cholinergic muscarinic m <dig> , <dig> receptors , dopaminergic 2-like receptors , and ionotropic n-methyl-d-aspartate  receptors  <cit> . ipla <dig>  which is dha-preferring, can be activated by agonist stimulation of cholinergic muscarinic m <dig> , <dig> and serotonergic 5-ht2a/2c receptors, but not of nmda receptors  <cit> .

the regulation of g-protein mediated activation of cpla <dig> or ipla <dig> depends on extracellular and intracellular calcium concentrations. cpla <dig> is activated by extracellular ca2+ entry into the cell and ipla <dig> by intracellular calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum via phospholipase c  . plc, when activated, converts membrane phosphatidylinositol  <dig> -bisphosphate  to diacylglycerol  and inositol  <dig> ,5-triphosphate . ip <dig> binding to ip <dig> receptors stimulates the release of intracellular ca2+
 <cit>  and of calcium influx factor  <cit>  from the endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum . the calcium influx factor contributes to the activation of ipla <dig> by dissociating calmodulin from the active site of ipla2
 <cit> . this plc-mediated activation of ipla <dig> results in the hydrolysis of dha from membrane phospholipid. dag can also be further hydrolyzed to release dha, although this pathway likely contributes minimally to dha release.

intracellular calcium release associated with activation of the plc pathway regulates vesicle transport and neurotransmitter release at synaptic terminals  <cit> . muscarinic m <dig> , <dig> and serotonergic 5-ht2a/2c neurotransmission is coupled to ipla <dig> via the plc pathway, as is dopaminergic neurotransmission, although the directionality of this coupling is not agreed on. activation of d2-like receptors in isolated neurons or dissected brain structures was reported to increase  <cit>  or decrease  <cit>  intracellular calcium release or ip <dig> concentration  <cit> . a reduction in intracellular calcium release would not activate ipla <dig>  whereas an increase would activate ipla <dig> and increase dha release.

in the present study, we wished to see if activation of brain d2-like receptors in unanesthetized rats would also lead to a dha signal, as it does an aa signal  <cit> . stimulation of dopaminergic receptors by the agonists quinpirole or apomorphine produced an aa signal that could be blocked by the d <dig> receptor antagonists raclopride or butaclamol in unanesthetized rats  <cit> .

to test this, we used an established in vivo kinetic method in awake rats  <cit> , to quantify the dha signal in response to the d2-like receptor agonist quinpirole, compared with vehicle. with this method, radiolabeled dha is infused to steady state levels in plasma, and brain radioactivity is measured with quantitative autoradiography to derive the regional incorporation coefficient, k*. we found that d2-like receptor activation with quinpirole did not change the dha incorporation coefficient  into brain compared to vehicle-treated controls, suggesting that d2-like receptor activation does not involve dha release as a second messenger.

methods
animals and diets
experiments were conducted following the “guide for the care and use of laboratory animals”  and were approved by the animal care and use committee of eunice kennedy shriver national institute of child health and human development. two-month-old male fischer cdf  <dig> rats  were acclimated for one month in an animal facility with regulated temperature, humidity and 12-h dark/light cycle. rats were maintained on the rodent nih- <dig> auto 18– <dig> diet , which contained   <dig> % saturated,  <dig> % monounsaturated,  <dig> % linoleic,  <dig> % α-linolenic,  <dig> % arachidonic,  <dig> % eicosapentaenoic, and  <dig> % docosahexaenoic acid  <cit> . water and food were provided ad libitum.

tracer purification and drug preparation
radiolabeled dha dissolved in ethanol  was purified on  <dig> a° thin-layer chromatography  silica plates  alongside phospholipid, cholesterol, cholesteryl ester, triglyceride and unesterified fatty acid standards using diethyl ether: heptane: acetic acid  as a solvent. the dha was purified because the stock tracer bottles used for this study had been opened in the past, a factor which was previously found to reduce tracer purity over time despite storing it in a −80°c freezer, due to loss of the preservative argon gas blanket in the stock bottle once opened. the plate was sprayed with  <dig> % 6-p-toluidine-2-naphthalene-sulfonic acid in 50 mm tris–hcl buffer  , and the unesterified fatty acid band containing dha was identified under uv light, scraped and purified from the silica particles by the folch method . the chloroform extract was dried under nitrogen, reconstituted twice with 10 ml ethanol, centrifuged to remove additional silica particles, and pipetted to a new 50 ml pyrex tube. the ethanol extract was reconstituted in 5 ml of ethanol. radioactive purity measured in a portion of the ethanol extract with hplc using acetonitrile/water  as a solvent , confirmed that 93% of the radioactivity eluted at the same time as the unesterified dha  standard. on the day of the experiment, a portion of the ethanol extract was dried under nitrogen and resuspended in hepes buffer, ph  <dig> , containing 50 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin .

an acute 1 mg/kg i.v. dose of -quinpirole hydrochloride dissolved in  <dig> % saline  was chosen because it produces widespread significant increments in the incorporation coefficient, k*, for aa in the brain of unanesthetized rats, which can be blocked by the d2-like receptor antagonists, butaclamol or raclopride, without causing convulsions  <cit> .

surgical procedures and tracer infusion
a total of  <dig> rats were randomized to saline or quinpirole treatment . rats were anesthetized with halothane  and polyethylene  catheters were surgically inserted into the right femoral artery and vein   <cit> . the wound was closed with surgical clips and the rat was wrapped loosely, with its upper body remaining free, in a fast-setting plaster cast taped to a wooden block. each surgery lasted 20–25 min. rats were allowed to recover from anesthesia for 3–4 h in an environment maintained at 25°c. rectal temperature was maintained at  <dig> - <dig> °c using a feedback-heating device and rectal thermometer. arterial blood pressure and heart rate were measured with a blood pressure recorder . one minute after an i.v. injection of quinpirole or saline, dha  was infused into the femoral vein for 5 min at a rate of 400 μl/min, using an infusion pump . blood was collected at baseline and after dha infusion . twenty min after beginning tracer infusion, the rat was euthanized with an overdose of nembutal®  and decapitated. the brain was removed, frozen in 2-methylbutane maintained at −40°c in dry ice, and stored at −80°c until sectioned.

chemical analysis
blood samples, collected before, during or after dha infusion, were centrifuged immediately at  <dig>  g for 30 s at room temperature. total lipids were extracted from plasma  using a modified folch procedure  <cit> . one hundred μl of the lower organic phase was used to determine the radiolabeled unesterified plasma dha concentration by liquid scintillation counting.

concentrations of unlabeled, unesterified fatty acids were determined from 100 μl of ice-thawed arterial plasma collected at 20 minutes. unesterified heptadecanoic acid  was added as an internal standard to the plasma and total lipids were extracted with the folch method. the total lipid extract was separated by thin layer chromatography on  <dig> a° silica gel plates  alongside phospholipid, unesterified fatty acids, triglyceride and cholesteryl ester standards using the solvent system heptane: diethylether:glacial acetic acid . the plates were sprayed with  <dig> % 6-p-toluidine-2-naphthalene-sulfonic acid in 50 mm tris–hcl buffer  , and the unesterified fatty acids band was identified under uv light, scraped and methylated with 1% h2so <dig>  in anhydrous methanol  after adding  <dig>  ml toluene. the fatty acid methyl esters were extracted with 3 ml heptane after terminating the reaction with  <dig>  ml water  <cit> , reconstituted in 25 μl of isooctane and quantified by gas chromatography as described  <cit> . the injection volume was 2 μl.

quantitative autoradiography
quantitative autoradiography was performed on a total of  <dig> brain regions from autoradiographs of coronal brain sections. the regions were identified from a stereotaxic rat brain atlas  <cit> , and were sampled in both hemispheres. the average of bilateral measurements for each region from three consecutive brain sections was used to calculate regional radioactivity  by digital quantitative densitometry, using the public domain  <dig>  analysis nih image program. regional brain incorporation coefficient k*  of dha were calculated as follows  <cit> :
  <dig>  

where   is brain radioactivity 20 min after infusion,   is arterial unesterified dha concentration, and t  is time after beginning dha infusion. integrated plasma radioactivity , which corresponds to the input function, was determined by trapezoidal integration and used to calculate k*.

the regional rate of incorporation of unesterified dha from plasma into brain phospholipids, jin , was calculated as follows  <cit> :
  <dig>  

where cplasma is the plasma concentration  of unlabeled unesterified dha. since negligible amounts of dha  can be synthesized de novo by the brain from its precursor, alpha-linolenic acid  <cit> , jin represents the metabolic loss of dha by the brain  <cit> .

statistical analysis
all data are presented as mean ± sd. an unpaired t-test was used to assess significant changes in body weight, baseline body temperature, arterial blood pressure and heart rate, input function, the incorporation coefficient  and the incorporation rate, jin. a paired t-test was applied to compare mean body temperature, blood pressure and heart rate in the same animal before and after saline or quinpirole injection. statistical significance was accepted at p <  <dig> .

RESULTS
physiological parameters
one control rat died after surgery and prior to infusion with saline due to unknown causes. during the brain slicing, one control and one quinpirole brains were not sectioned uniformly, resulting in a saturated, unquantifiable signal, and a sample size of  <dig> saline and  <dig> quinpirole. physiological parameters, plasma input function and fatty acid concentrations were therefore obtained from  <dig> saline and  <dig> quinpirole treated rats.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
d2-like receptor activation by acute quinpirole did not significantly change brain dha incorporation coefficient  or rate  in any of the  <dig> regions studied. the incorporation coefficient k* reflects the metabolic loss of dha by the brain following its release from membrane phospholipid and jin reflects net loss  <cit> . the lack of a quinpirole effect on each parameter suggests that d2-like receptor activation does not involve dha release from membrane phospholipid.

dha release is controlled by ipla2
 <cit> , which is activated following displacement of bound calmodulin protein by calcium influx factor  <cit> . intracellular calcium increases concurrently because it is released with the calcium influx factor from the er/sr in response to ip <dig> formation following plc stimulation . unlike ipla <dig>  cpla <dig> requires extracellular calcium for activation  <cit> , consistent with in vivo evidence of increased aa but not dha incorporation into the brain following glutamatergic nmda receptor activation, which allows extracellular calcium into the cell  <cit> . d2-like receptor stimulation also allows extracellular calcium into the cell, similar to nmda  <cit> . thus, the increase in aa  <cit>  but not dha incorporation  following acute quinpirole confirms the independence of ipla <dig> of extracellular calcium and likely reflects selective coupling of d2-like receptors to cpla <dig> but not ipla <dig>  several in vitro studies reported a reduction in intracellular calcium levels following dopaminergic activation  <cit> . the lack of effect of quinpirole on k* agrees with these observations.

this study does not rule out the possibility that intracellular calcium levels increased following d2-receptor stimulation with quinpirole, as reported in vitro . such elevations if present, however, were not significant enough to produce a measurable dha signal with our method.

this study demonstrates that there is no dha signal following activation of d2-like receptors, although there is a signal following activation of muscarinic and serotonergic receptors  <cit> . it is likely, therefore, that ipla <dig> is activated by the latter two but not d <dig> receptors. the difference in g-protein receptor coupling remains to be clarified, but it may be related to limited intracellular calcium release and dissociation of calmodulin from ipla <dig> following dopaminergic receptor stimulation, compared to muscarinic stimulation .

in summary, this study showed that d2-like receptor activation does not involve dha release as a second messenger. this observation, along with our previous finding that d2-like receptor activation stimulates aa release, suggest that d <dig> receptors are selectively coupled to aa but not dha as a second messenger.
