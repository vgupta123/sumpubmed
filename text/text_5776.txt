BACKGROUND
antibiotic-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains emerging from the community as well as hospital environments represent a global threat  <cit> , requiring new approaches to control this pathogen. the anterior nare is the major reservoir of s. aureus in humans; 80% of the human population may be carriers  <cit> . a causal relationship between nasal colonization of s. aureus and serious infection has been established; thus, eliminating s. aureus nasal carriage may reduce the risk of infection  <cit> . coagulase-negative staphylococci  are known commensal flora of the skin and mucous membranes and also colonize human anterior nares. recently cons have been recognised as opportunistic pathogens responsible for the increasing incidence of serious nosocomial infections, mainly because of their affinity for the foreign materials used in prosthetics and indwelling devices. immunocompromised patients, including those undergoing haemodialysis, are especially susceptible to these infections  <cit> . more than 80% of clinical cons strains and 30% to 40% of cons obtained from healthy carriers or patients from the community are resistant to methicillin  <cit> .

bactroban nasal  has been approved for nasal clearance of s. aureus and significantly reduces the risk of postoperative staphylococcal infection in carriers  <cit> . however, mupirocin resistance has already been reported, and its use is restricted in many countries. a superior product for intranasal prophylaxis in at-risk patients is therefore an unmet medical need. new chemical entities take longer to develop, and killing by broad-spectrum antibiotics is undesirable. current efforts are therefore focused on pathogen-specific biological entities such as peptidoglycan hydrolases  <cit> , antibodies  <cit> , and other antimicrobial peptides and proteins  <cit> . for example, lysostaphin is a bacterial peptidoglycan hydrolase that has been extensively studied for its antistaphylococcal activity in various animal models  <cit> . bacteriophages are viruses that infect and kill bacteria and have co-evolved with bacterial defenses  <cit> . bacteriophages have been used for human therapy in several eastern european countries for decades  <cit> . although they have not been used in clinical applications in western countries, the united states food and drug administration recently approved the use of bacteriophages to prevent bacterial contamination in meat  <cit> . in addition, bacteriophages are a good source of cell wall-degrading enzymes, which have been evaluated as antibacterial agents  <cit> .

p <dig> is a novel chimeric protein that derives its staphylococcal cell wall-degrading enzymatic domain from the gene product, orf <dig>  of bacteriophage k and the cell wall-targeting domain  from lysostaphin . we have previously reported the construction of this novel chimeric protein and assignment of its peptidoglycan hydrolase activity to the cysteine, histidine-dependent amidohydrolase/peptidase  domain. we also demonstrated the efficacy of p <dig> in nasal clearance of methicillin-resistant s. aureus  in a rodent model  <cit> . p <dig> is under development for topical indications including use against s. aureus nasal carriage. in this study we tested the antistaphylococcal activity of p <dig> by determining minimum inhibitory concentration , minimum bactericidal concentration , time-kill kinetics, and activity against staphylococci from human nares.

methods
bacterial strains
all s. aureus strains used in the study are listed in table  <dig>  these include  <dig> clinical strains  from the public health research institute, new jersey and two usa  <dig> strains.

mic was determined using a modification of the clsi broth microdilution method. p <dig> was tested at  <dig> to  <dig>  μg/ml. s. aureus atcc  <dig> and s. carnosus atcc  <dig> were used as control strains. mbc was determined following the clsi procedure by plating  <dig> μl from the mic, mic ×  <dig>  mic ×  <dig>  and mic ×  <dig> wells on lb agar, and incubating the plates overnight at 37°c. strains 1- <dig> constitute a global panel of distinct clinical isolates  obtained from the public health research institute ; strains  <dig> and  <dig> are usa <dig> 

p <dig> expression and purification
p <dig> protein was cloned and expressed under the inducible t <dig> expression system in e. coli er <dig> strain. details of cloning and design of the p <dig> clone-construct were reported previously .

to generate a purified preparation of p <dig> for the studies reported in this work, expression of p <dig> protein in e. coli er <dig> was induced with  <dig> mm iptg, at 37°c for  <dig> h. the induced cell pellet was lysed and the protein in the supernatant was subjected to 0-50% ammonium sulphate precipitation using solid ammonium sulphate at 4°c. the precipitate was dialysed against  <dig> mm tris hcl buffer ph  <dig> , passed through an anion exchange column. the unbound fraction , containing p <dig> protein, was bound to a cation exchange column using  <dig> mm sodium acetate buffer at ph  <dig> . the bound protein was eluted using a linear gradient of  <dig> to  <dig>  m sodium chloride. fractions containing p <dig> protein were extensively dialysed against saline and used for all the studies.

mic and mbc
the mic was determined using a modified clinical and laboratory standards institute  broth microdilution procedure  <cit> . briefly, microtiter wells were pre-coated with  <dig> % bovine serum albumin  to prevent nonspecific p <dig> adherence to the polystyrene plate, based on the method published for lysostaphin  <cit> . two-fold dilutions of p <dig> were prepared in mueller hinton broth  supplemented with  <dig> % bsa , and  <dig> μl aliquots of the p <dig> dilutions  were added to the wells. bacterial suspensions  were diluted in mhb to achieve  <dig> ×  <dig> colony-forming units  per ml. then  <dig> μl aliquots of the cell suspension were added to wells containing p <dig>  plates were incubated under static conditions at 35°c for  <dig> h. the mic was defined as the lowest concentration of p <dig> in which no visible growth was observed at the end of the incubation period. the mbc was also determined using the clsi procedure. briefly,  <dig> μl from the mic, two times mic , four times mic , and eight times mic  wells were plated on luria bertani  agar and incubated at 37°c overnight.

mic of vancomycin was determined for a panel of s. aureus isolates that represented the mic range of p <dig>  using the clsi broth microdilution method. vancomycin was tested at concentrations of  <dig> - <dig> μg/ml, and mics were read manually after  <dig> h of incubation. mbc was also determined using the clsi procedure. the reference strain, s. aureus atcc  <dig> was used for quality control of the assay, in case of both p <dig> and vancomycin mic and mbc determinations.

time-kill curve studies
the kinetics of p <dig> bactericidal activity were assessed in vitro using six s. aureus strains: bk# <dig>  bk# <dig>  bk# <dig>  bk# <dig>  bk# <dig>  and bk# <dig>  the cryopreserved test strains were plated on lb agar plate and incubated overnight at 37°c. several well-isolated colonies were picked up and suspended in mhb broth; the turbidity was then adjusted to  <dig>  mcfarland standard . the initial inoculum was prepared by inoculating  <dig> μl of each test bacterial suspension into  <dig> ml mhb supplemented with  <dig> % bsa. after  <dig> h in a shaker incubator ,  <dig>  ml aliquots of the culture were dispensed into four tubes, and  <dig>  ml p <dig> was added. a  <dig>  ml aliquot was immediately removed to determine the initial cfu . incubation was continued, and  <dig>  ml aliquots were taken at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> h. the cultures were serially diluted in sterile saline immediately after sampling and plated on mhb agar. after overnight incubation of the plates, cfu were determined. the time-kill curve was plotted based on bacterial survival at the sampling intervals  <cit> .

efficacy of p <dig> hydrogel applied to s. aureus on agar surface
p <dig> hydrogel was formulated with hydroxyethyl cellulose , propylene glycol , and glycerin  as the main excipients along with p <dig> protein. a formulation that contained physiological saline in place of p <dig>  served as a negative control. lb agar was poured into 24-well tissue culture plates . s. aureus  cells at  <dig> cfu/well  and  <dig> cfu/well  were seeded on lb agar in the microwells. p <dig> gel was diluted two-fold in buffer gel to contain p <dig> protein at a concentration range of  <dig> to  <dig>  μg/ml. p <dig> gel preparations were applied to wells and the plates were incubated at 37°c for  <dig> h. at the end of incubation,  <dig> μl iodonitrotetrazolium chloride  prepared in  <dig> mm sodium phosphate buffer, ph  <dig>   was added to the wells to visualize viable cells.

bactericidal activity of p <dig> in simulated nasal fluid
activity of p <dig> was tested in a buffer that simulated the ionic composition of nasal fluid. the simulated nasal fluid  contained  <dig> % nacl,  <dig> % cacl <dig>  2h <dig>   <dig> % kcl, and  <dig> % bsa  <cit> . the s. aureus col strain was subcultured in lb medium from an overnight culture and grown at 37°c and  <dig> rpm until the od <dig> reached  <dig>  to  <dig>  .  <dig> μl of this cell suspension  was centrifuged at  <dig> × g for  <dig> min and the cell pellet was suspended in  <dig> μl of snf.  <dig> μl of p <dig> prepared in snf  was added to the cells. as a positive control, p <dig> contained in physiological saline was added to cells suspended in physiological saline. after addition of p <dig>  tubes were incubated for  <dig> h in a shaker incubator at 37°c,  <dig> rpm. cells were then pelleted and resuspended in  <dig> ml lb, and 10-fold dilutions were plated on lb agar and incubated at 37°c overnight. cells treated with snf or saline served as untreated cell controls.

efficacy of p <dig> gel on nasal staphylococci in their native physiological state
nasal commensal staphylococci of  <dig> healthy people were characterized and evaluated for sensitivity to p <dig>  a dry swab  was inserted into each nostril, rotated six times to cover the entire mucosal surface of the anterior nare, and slowly withdrawn. the swab from one nostril of each individual was immersed in a vial containing  <dig> μl p <dig> hydrogel , and a swab from the other nostril was immersed in a vial containing  <dig> μl buffer gel . the vials were placed in a biosafety cabinet for  <dig> h at ambient temperature . the entire vial contents were then spread on blood agar plates and incubated overnight at 37°c. cfus recovered were characterized in terms of colony morphology, hemolysis on blood agar, gram stain, and a histaph identification kit .

RESULTS
p <dig> is a bacteriophage derived staphylococcal cell-wall degrading enzyme. this protein is under development in our laboratory for topical therapeutic use in humans. in this study, we tested the bactericidal activity of p <dig> protein on globally prevalent s. aureus clinical strains. we assessed the biological activity of p <dig> using various in vitro assays and under conditions designed to simulate physiological conditions.

p <dig> protein preparations used in this study were of > 95% purity. the protein expressed was in the soluble form in a standard e. coli expression system and purified using a 2-step ion-exchange chromatography procedure  <cit> .

susceptibility to p <dig> determined by mic and mbc assay
determination of mic and mbc is a commonly used method to assess susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. we determined the mic and mbc of p <dig> for a panel of  <dig> globally represented strains of s. aureus using modified clsi methods  <cit> . microtiter plate wells were pre-coated with bsa before adding p <dig> to minimize nonspecific adherence and loss of protein to the polypropylene surface. the mic of p <dig> for the various strains of s. aureus ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> μg/ml . the mic at which 50% of the strains tested were inhibited  was  <dig> μg/ml. the mbc of p <dig> across s. aureus strains tested also ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> μg/ml; and the mbc <dig> was found to be  <dig> μg/ml .

mic and mbc of vancomycin were determined using the same procedure that was used in case of p <dig>  for the reference strain, s. aureus atcc  <dig> mic and mbc of vancomycin was found be  <dig>  μg/ml and  <dig> μg/ml respectively. these values correlate with the reported mic and mbc of vancomycin for this strain, validating the assay used in this work. vancomycin was also tested on a panel of s. aureus strains that represented the mic range of p <dig> . mic of vancomycin for these strains ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> μg/ml and mbc ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> μg/ml .

mic was determined by modified broth microdilution method following the clsi procedure. vancomycin test concentration was in the range of  <dig> to  <dig>  μg/ml. s. aureus atcc  <dig> was used as the control strain. mbc was determined following the clsi procedure by plating  <dig> μl from the mic, mic ×  <dig>  mic ×  <dig> and mic ×  <dig> wells on lb agar and incubating the plates at 37°c overnight. the strains used here span the mic range of p <dig> 

strains 1- <dig> were selected from a globally represented panel of distinct, typed clinical isolates  obtained from the public health research institute, new jersey, usa; strain  <dig> is usa500/ <dig>  and  <dig> is s. aureus, atcc 25923

since mic relates to growth inhibition activity of an antimicrobial agent, mbc may be a more appropriate measure of activity of p <dig> which is bactericidal in action.

time-kill curve studies
time-kill assays were performed in accordance with the clsi guidelines, with a starting inoculum of  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu/ml and, various multiples of the mics. the objective of this assay was to evaluate concentration-dependent bactericidal activity. in order to find the optimal concentration required to achieve and maintain >  <dig> % killing upto  <dig> h, sub-mic levels were not considered. the detection limit of the time kill curve was  <dig> cfu/ml.

we determined the number of viable s. aureus cells remaining at different time intervals after adding p <dig> protein. figure  <dig> shows the time-kill curves of p <dig> for six representative strains of s. aureus, which included five mrsa strains and one mssa strain. p <dig> showed rapid, dose-dependent bactericidal activity against the mssa and mrsa strains tested, killing of  <dig> % of cells in all six strains tested within  <dig> h at the respective mic concentration. at the mic, growth was inhibited up to  <dig> h for all five mrsa strains and up to  <dig> h for the mssa strain . however, the cells of bk# <dig> that grew after  <dig> h were susceptible to p <dig> . since a concentration 4× the mic inhibited growth of this strain for up to  <dig> h, we surmised that higher concentrations of p <dig> or repeated treatments may be required in such cases.

efficacy of p <dig> gel formulation applied to s. aureus on agar surface
the efficacy of p <dig> hydrogel was tested on solid culture medium to simulate the conditions of topical nasal application.

the assay format was designed to check availability of the protein when applied as a gel formulation. the objective was also to test efficacy of p <dig> gel applied to a surface where low numbers of bacterial cells are present. we have used a range of 100- <dig> μg/ml of protein concentration in the gel formulation. p <dig> gel showed complete clearance at concentrations up to  <dig>  μg/ml .

bactericidal activity of p <dig> against s. aureus col in snf
functional efficiency and structural stability of enzymes can generally be influenced by ph, temperature, and the composition and concentrations of metal or inorganic ions in the reaction milieu. our primary concern was that monovalent and divalent ions present in nasal fluid may have a deleterious effect on p <dig> activity. we therefore evaluated the activity of p <dig> in a composition that simulated the ionic content of normal human nasal fluid. we found that p <dig> reduced the staphylococcal viable count  by five orders of magnitude in snf, comparable to the activity observed in case of p <dig> in physiological saline. cells incubated in snf that did not contain p <dig> were unaffected . these results indicate that the protein would not be influenced by the ionic content of human nasal fluid.

efficacy of p <dig> gel on nasal staphylococci in their native physiological state
secreted products and components such as exotoxins, exoenzymes, surface-associated adhesins, and capsular polysaccharide play a role modulating host responses to s. aureus infection  <cit> . production of capsular polysaccharide type  <dig> by staphylococci has been reported in a study using a mouse model of s. aureus nasal colonization  <cit> . the same study also showed the inability of a capsule-defective mutant to persist in mouse nares, indicating that s. aureus is encapsulated in the nares. the rate of methicillin resistance among cons isolates colonizing anterior nares of patients undergoing haemodialysis is reported to be higher than that of s. aureus isolates; this is accompanied by the lack of susceptibility to other classes of antibiotics  <cit> . although s. epidermidis is responsible for most cons infections, other cons species have been associated with a variety of human diseases  <cit> . for example, s. haemolyticus is the second most commonly encountered species in clinical infections, and s. lugdunensis is a more recently described cons species  <cit> .

in this context, we evaluated the bactericidal activity of p <dig> on s. aureus and other staphylococcal species recovered from human nares. as the first step, we characterized the nasal commensal bacteria of  <dig> healthy people. speciation was carried out using the histaph identification kit and the s. aureus carriage rate was also determined. nasal staphylococci of 71% of the healthy people sampled consisted of cons species, predominantly s. epidermidis and s. aureus was found in the remaining 29% of people. other cons among nasal commensal bacteria included s. haemolyticus and s. lugdunensis . we examined nasal commensal populations in two randomly selected healthy people for comparability between the two nares with respect to bacterial load and staphylococcal species present and found both nares to be comparable .

commensal bacteria recovered from nasal swabs of  <dig> healthy people were plated on blood agar, enumerated, and characterized by gram stain, coagulase test, and speciation

we then evaluated the activity of p <dig> hydrogel on nasal staphylococci of  <dig> healthy people.

in case of nasal swabs immersed in buffer-gel, colonies were numerous, ranging from  <dig> -  <dig> cfu; estimated based on results of a preliminary experiment, where s. aureus cells of known cfu counts  were plated to vizualize the pattern of growth after overnight incubation of plates . of the swabs immersed in p <dig> hydrogel, 4/ <dig> showed >  <dig> % reduction in staphylococcal cell counts, 17/ <dig> showed  <dig> % reduction, 5/ <dig> showed 99% reduction, and 5/ <dig> showed 90% reduction . a few colonies that grew on the plate containing p <dig> were found to be sensitive to the protein when tested, and hence apparently escaped the protein action.

both nares of each individual were swabbed. one swab was immersed in p <dig> hydrogel, and the other was immersed in buffer gel . staphylococcal cfu counts of nasal swabs immersed in p <dig> gel were significantly lower than cfu counts of control swabs

this finding shows that p <dig> is bactericidal to nasal staphylococcal isolates. however, we did not evaluate the presence of capsular polysaccharides, which may be assessed in future studies in our laboratory. it is important to note that the cells were treated with p <dig> hydrogel immediately after isolation . we conclude that both s. aureus and cons are susceptible to p <dig> in the physiological state relevant to nasal carriage. considering the pathogenic potential and multidrug resistance of these species, it is significant that these species were fully sensitive to p <dig>  further studies are needed to determine the mic and mbc of p <dig> on cons.

reports point to the endogenous origin of most infective s. aureus isolates and mrsa carriage poses an increased risk for invasive infections compared with mssa carriage  <cit> . the worldwide spread of mrsa strains, which are often multidrug-resistant  <cit> , combined with limited therapeutic options necessitates new approaches to combat this pathogen. recent findings emphasize that commensal cons strains are also potential threats  <cit> . therefore an antibacterial agent, exemplified by p <dig>  which can target antibiotic resistant s. aureus as well as other clinically significant staphylococci would meet the current medical need and warrants further development.

CONCLUSIONS
this report describes the development and in vitro biological characterization of a chimeric antistaphylococcal protein designated p <dig>  which exhibits rapid and selective antibacterial activity at low mic values against a broad range of staphylococcal species, including numerous clinically relevant s. aureus strains.

the mic and mbc of p <dig> on a global panel of clinical isolates ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> μg/ml. p <dig> showed in vitro microbicidal activity against a wide variety of staphylococcal species, including many clinically relevant s. aureus strains. with an mbc <dig> of  <dig> μg/ml, the protein was bactericidal against every s. aureus strain tested. p <dig> time-kill kinetics were determined at mic and higher concentrations on select isolates, and p <dig> was found to rapidly reduce cell numbers by  <dig> %. to develop p <dig> as a treatment to eliminate human nasal carriage, p <dig> was formulated as a hydrogel and tested on nasal staphylococci recovered from healthy people. the protein was able to kill s. aureus under conditions representing physiological conditions. taken together, our findings demonstrate that p <dig> exhibits excellent antistaphylococcal properties and warrants development for therapeutic use.
