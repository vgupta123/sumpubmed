BACKGROUND
two different strategies of fe uptake have been described in plants. the so-called chelation strategy , which is mainly found in graminaceous plants, is based on the excretion of phytosideropores  to the rhizosphere. phytosideropores rapidly chelate fe, to form fe-ps chelates that are subsequently transported into the root cells through a specific transporter. the so-called reduction strategy  relies on the coordinated action of a membrane bound fe reductase, that reduces fe to fe  <cit> , an fe uptake transporter  <cit>  and an h+ -atpase that lowers the ph of the rhizosphere  <cit> , is mainly used by non graminaceous plants, including beta vulgaris. the reduction strategy includes root morphological, physiological and biochemical changes that lead to an increased capacity for fe uptake. morphological changes include root tip swelling, development of transfer cells and an increase in the number of lateral roots, leading to an increase in the root surface in contact with the medium  <cit> .

some plants are able to accumulate and/or release both reducing and chelating substances, such as phenolics and flavins, which may have a role in fe acquisition  <cit> . iron has been shown to down-regulate riboflavin  synthesis in flavinogenic yeast strains and some bacteria  <cit> . in plants, rbfl and derivatives are accumulated and/or excreted in fe-deficient roots and could act as a redox bridge for electron transport to the fe reductase  <cit> . moreover, fro <dig> belongs to a superfamily of flavocytochrome oxidoreductases  <cit> , and a recent study confirmed that the fro <dig> protein contains fad sequence motifs on the inside of the membrane  <cit> . also, a connection between fe deficiency perception and rbfl excretion has been described to occur through basic helix-loop-helix  transcription factors in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> .

at the metabolic level, increases in the activity of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase  and several enzymes of the glycolytic pathway and the tricarboxylic acid  cycle have been found in different plant species grown under fe deficiency  <cit> . transcriptomic  <cit>  and proteomic studies in fe deficient plants  <cit>  have also reported increases in root transcript and protein abundances, respectively, of enzymes related to the glycolytic and tca cycle pathways, among others. iron deficiency also induces an accumulation of organic acids, mainly malate and citrate, in roots  <cit> . the induction of c metabolism in roots of fe-deficient plants would not only provide a source of reducing power, protons and atp for the fe reductase and h+-atpase enzymes, but also lead to an anaplerotic root c fixation  <cit> . carbon accumulated in roots is exported in the form of organic acids via xylem  <cit>  to leaves  <cit> , which have otherwise drastically reduced photosynthetic rates when fe-deficient. the higher energy requirements in fe-deficient root cells are tackled by increasing mitochondrial oxidative processes, and roots from fe-deficient plants show enhanced respiratory activities and higher o <dig> consumption rates  <cit> . on the other hand, the mitochondrial respiratory chain is strongly affected under fe-deficient conditions  <cit> , since some of its components are fe-containing enzymes. iron deficiency leads to an enhancement of different ros detoxification strategies  <cit> . furthermore, an increase in anaerobic metabolism has also been described in fe-deficient roots  <cit> , probably as an strategy to oxidize all the reducing power generated by glycolysis and tca cycle that can not be easily oxidized in the respiratory chain. when resupplied with fe, fe-deficient plants reorganize its metabolism by readjusting metabolic cycles and changing root morphology towards those typical of fe-sufficient plants  <cit> .

the most common approach used to study fe deficiency in roots is to analyze only a small number of genes, proteins and/or metabolites. a more comprehensive knowledge of the processes taking place in fe-deficient roots has been recently provided by the application of modern techniques allowing for the simultaneous and untargeted analysis of multiple genes or proteins  <cit> . the aim of this work was to characterize the changes induced in the root tip proteome and metabolome of sugar beet plants in response to fe deficiency and resupply, in order to provide a holistic view of the metabolic processes occurring in plants under different fe status.

RESULTS
ief-page electrophoresis
the polypeptide pattern of root tip extracts was obtained by 2-d ief-sds page electrophoresis. real scans of typical 2-d gels are shown in figure 1; an average number of  <dig> and  <dig> polypeptides were detected in fe-sufficient and fe-deficient plants, respectively . the total number of spots detected was relatively low when compared to other proteomic studies  <cit> . several causes may account for this discrepancy, including i) protein extraction method and amount of protein loaded in the gels, ii) gel size, iii) pi range and iv) sensitivity of the staining method. averaged 2-d polypeptide maps were obtained using gels of three independent preparations, each from a different batch of plants . to better describe polypeptide changes we built a composite averaged virtual map containing all spots present in both fe-deficient and control root tip extracts . iron deficiency caused 2-fold increases in  <dig> spots  and 2-fold decreases in signal intensity in  <dig> spots .

furthermore,  <dig> spots were only detected in fe-sufficient plant samples  and  <dig> spots were only detected in fe-deficient plants . all polypeptides in the composite averaged map are depicted again in figure 1d, to permit annotation of those polypeptides where identification was achieved by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization - time of flight ms . these polypeptides were labeled from a to v as described in figure 1d, and homologies found are described in detail in table  <dig> 

scores  are based on:  ms <dig> peptide mass fingerprint data, with protein scores > <dig> being statistically significant , and ms <dig> ion sequencing data, with individual ion scores >  <dig> indicating identity or extensive homology . in both cases, protein scores are derived from ion scores as a non-probabilistic basis for ranking protein hits. proteins are separated in different groups depending on whether they increased, decreased, appeared  or disappeared  when compared to control plants.

from the  <dig> spots that showed increases in signal in root tip extracts of fe-deficient as compared to fe-sufficient controls, the  <dig> more abundant were excised and analyzed by maldi-ms. since the sugar beet genome has not been sequenced yet and few sequences are available in the databases, identification was performed by homology searches with proteins from other plant species. from the  <dig> spots analyzed,  <dig> proteins were identified . these include proteins related to glycolysis such as fructose  <dig> -bisphosphate aldolase , triose-phosphate isomerase , 3-phosphoglycerate kinase  and enolase . three spots gave significant matches to malate dehydrogenase , and two more polypeptides presented homology with α and β subunits from f <dig> atp synthase . other proteins increasing in root tip extracts from fe-deficient sugar beet plants as compared to the controls were fructokinase  and formate dehydrogenase . also, one spot gave significant matches to a cytosolic peptidase at1g79210/yup8h12r_ <dig> . spot n gave significant match to a glycine rich protein, which possibly has a role in rna transcription or processing during stress conditions.

from the  <dig> spots detected de novo in proteome maps from root tip extracts of fe-deficient plants , the  <dig> more abundant were excised and analyzed by maldi-ms, resulting in only  <dig> positive matches . these significant matches were found for glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase  and dmrl . changes in the amount of dmrl as well as dmrl gene expression and flavin analysis were further studied using root tip extracts of fe-sufficient, fe-deficient and fe-resupplied sugar beet plants .

from the  <dig> spots showing a decrease in signal intensity in root tip extracts from fe-deficient plants as compared to controls ,  <dig> were identified by maldi-ms. spots q and r  gave a significant match to nucleoside diphosphate kinase i and to oxalate oxidase-like germin, respectively. spot s presented homology with the at4g <dig> protein  whose molecular function is to interact selectively with fmn, and also presents oxidoreductase activity.

from the  <dig> spots not detected in root tip extracts from fe-deficient plants as compared to the controls ,  <dig> were identified by maldi-ms . proteins matched were oxalate oxidase , peroxidase  and caffeoyl coa o-metyltransferase .

dmrl synthase gene expression analysis
to identify a putative dmrl synthase cdna in b. vulgaris, primers were designed based on dmrl synthase sequence from the closely related specie s. oleracea . a pcr product of approximately  <dig> bp was amplified, purified and sequenced . the translated amino acid sequence for the dmrl synthase putative orf had  <dig> aminoacids, a predicted mw of  <dig>  kda and a pi of  <dig> . the predicted protein displayed 90% identity at the amino acid level with s. oleracea dmrl , and homologies with other known dmrls sequences included in the alignment analysis ranged from  <dig> to 56% . thus, we have assigned the name bvdmrl to the corresponding dmrl synthase gene of b. vulgaris, and the sequence has been deposited in genbank as accession gq <dig>  transcriptional regulation by fe status of the bvdmrl gene was assessed by semi-quantitative rt-pcr. bvdmrl transcript abundance was much higher in root tips from fe-deficient as compared to control plants . the expression of bvdmrl was drastically reduced  <dig> h after fe-resupply to fe-deficient plants  but it was still higher than that observed in fe-sufficient root tips. however, transcript abundance in root tips sampled  <dig> h after fe-resupply, which showed two different zones , had a low expression level, similar to that measured in fe-sufficient plants .

dmrl synthase protein analysis
real scans of the 2-d gel zone where dmrl synthase protein is located  are shown in figure 2b. the dmrl synthase protein was detected not only in fe-deficient root tip extracts but also in extracts of root tip yz from plants resupplied with fe for  <dig> and  <dig> h . conversely, dmrl synthase was not detected in extracts of the new wz of root tips from plants  <dig> h after fe resupply, or in fe-sufficient root tip extracts .

flavin concentrations
since dmrl synthase is one of the key enzymes in flavin synthesis, we also examined flavin concentrations in root tip extracts from fe-sufficient, fe-deficient and fe-resupplied plants by high performance liquid chromatography . riboflavin, fad and rbfl sulphates were found in fe-deficient and fe-resupplied root tip yz extracts. riboflavin sulphates and rbfl account for 98% and 2% of the total flavin concentration, respectively, and only traces of fad were found. rbfl sulphate concentrations were  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> nmol g- <dig> fw in the root yz of fe-deficient plants and  <dig> h and  <dig> h fe-resupplied plants, respectively . riboflavin concentration ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  nmol g- <dig> fw in root yz . only traces of these compounds were present either in controls or in the wz of  <dig> h fe-resupplied plants.

metabolite analyses
changes induced by fe-deficiency and fe-resupply in the root tip metabolome were evaluated by non-biased gas chromatography mass spectrometry  metabolite profiling. a total of  <dig> metabolites were present in at least 80% of the samples of at least one treatment, and  <dig> of them were identified. partial least square analysis shows a good separation between +fe and -fe root tips . iron-deficient samples were closer to the  <dig> h and  <dig> h yz samples than to the  <dig> h wz ones. on the other hand, the  <dig> h wz samples were closer to the +fe samples than to the -fe ones.

iron deficiency and/or resupply caused significant changes  in the levels of  <dig> out of the  <dig> identified metabolites. metabolite level data were normalized to the mean response of the +fe treatment; response ratios, defined as the level in a given treatment divided by the level in the +fe control, are indicated in table  <dig>  iron deficiency caused significant changes in the response ratios of  <dig> metabolites. large  increases were found for some organic acids , some sugars , nicotianamine and 2-aminoadipic acid. the response ratio of oxalic acid decreased markedly in -fe conditions, whereas those of other aminoacids, n compounds, lipid metabolites and others did not show large  changes when compared to the fe-sufficient controls.

when the response ratio  was lower than  <dig> the inverse was taken and the sign changed. values indicated in bold represent a t-test significance of p <  <dig> . the last column shows a. thaliana kegg pathway numbers where the metabolite is predicted to be involved; all kegg pathway numbers are hyper-linked to the corresponding kegg website. to reach one specific pathway in kegg type in your web browser:  "http://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?ath0xxxx" being xxxx the pathway number.

twenty-four hours after fe-resupply, there was a dramatic coordinated increase in the root tip response ratios of galactinol, raffinose, lactobionic acid, cellobiose and nicotianamine when compared to those found in fe-deficient roots, whereas the response ratios of sucrose, myo-inositol, citrate and malate decreased. seventy-two hours after fe resupply, the response ratios of galactinol, raffinose, cellobiose, nicotianamine and many other compounds had decreased in the yz areas, whereas in the wz the response ratios were very low. the response ratio of many of the lipids increased moderately in all fe resupplied samples. metabolites in the coenzyme, glycolysis, oxidative stress, pentose phosphate pathway and signalling categories did not show large response ratio changes with fe resupply.

regarding the unknown metabolites, significant changes  were found for  <dig> of the  <dig> metabolites with fe deficiency and/or resupply . binbase metabolite id  <dig> showed the largest response ratio . the response of this metabolite to fe status was very similar to that found for the rfos, and in fact its mass spectra and retention index show a good similarity in binbase to those of other disaccharides such as leucrose, suggesting that it could be a rfo related compound .

raffinose and galactinol concentrations
the concentrations of raffinose and galactinol in root tips were determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc-ms. raffinose concentrations were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  nmol g fw- <dig> in the -fe, 24h, 72h wz, 72h yz and +fe tissues, respectively. galactinol concentrations were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  nmol g fw- <dig> in the -fe, 24h, 72h wz, 72h yz and +fe tissues, respectively.

discussion
the changes induced by fe deficiency in the root tip proteome and metabolome from sugar beet plants grown in hydroponics have been studied. more than  <dig> proteins  and  <dig> metabolites  were resolved in sugar beet root tip extracts. iron deficiency resulted in significant and higher than 2-fold changes in the relative amounts of  <dig> polypeptides, and  <dig> of them were identified. out of  <dig> identified metabolites,  <dig> changed significantly with fe deficiency. in general, our results are in agreement with previous transcriptomic  <cit> , proteomic  <cit>  and enzymatic  <cit>  studies on fe-deficient roots. our data confirm the increases previously found in proteins and metabolites related to carbohydrate metabolism and tca cycle pathways  <cit> . two major changes induced by fe deficiency in roots are described in this study for the first time: the increase in dmrl synthase protein concentration and gene expression, and the increase in rfo sugars.

the largest change found in the proteome map of root tip extracts from sugar beet plants grown in fe deficiency conditions corresponded to dmrl synthase, which was detected de novo in fe-deficient root tips, and is the protein with the highest concentration in these gels . this enzyme catalyses the fourth step of rbfl biosynthesis, and rbfl is the precursor of rbfl sulphates, fmn and fad, the last one being a cofactor for the root plasma membrane fe reductase  <cit> . the expression of bvdmrl decreased drastically  <dig> h after the addition of fe to fe-deficient plants, whereas dmrl synthase protein abundance and rbfl and rbfl sulphate concentrations did not change significantly with fe-resupply in the yz of root tips , suggesting that the turnover of this protein is slow. accumulation in fe-deficient roots of flavin compounds, including rbfl and rbfl 3' - and 5'-sulphate is a characteristic response of sugar beet and other plant species  <cit> . the exact role of flavins in fe deficiency is unknown, and it has been hypothesized, based on the similar location of flavin accumulation and fe reduction and on the fact that the fe reductase is a flavin-containing protein, that free flavin accumulation may be an integral part of the fe-reducing system in roots from strategy i plants  <cit> . on the other hand, these compounds are secreted to the growth media at low ph  <cit>  and, assuming high concentrations at the secretion site, they could mediate extracellular electron transfer between soil fe deposits and root fe reductase as it has been described for flavin phosphates secreted by some bacteria  <cit> . moreover, excreted flavins could also act as a plant-generated signal that could influence rhizosphere microbial populations, indirectly affecting fe availability  <cit> .

a major change in carbohydrate metabolism was the large increase in rfo compounds  that occurs in roots with fe deficiency. this increase was higher than that found for sucrose . the total concentrations of raffinose and galactinol were also determined by hplc-ms, and concentrations of both compounds in the 35- <dig> nmol g fw- <dig> range were found in fe-deficient and fe-resupplied root tips , whereas concentrations in the +fe treatment were one order of magnitude lower. the sum of the raffinose and galactinol concentrations in the -fe, 24h, 72hwz, 72hyz and +fe tissues was  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the total sucrose, respectively, supporting the relevance of the rfos changes with fe status. rfos have diverse roles in plants, including transport and storage of c  <cit>  and acting as compatible solutes for protection in abiotic stresses  <cit> . other explanation for the large increase in the relative amounts of rfos could be the ability to function as antioxidants  <cit> ; galactinol and raffinose have hydroxyl radical scavenging activities similar to other soluble antioxidants such as glutathione and ascorbic acid  <cit> . since ros damage and ros detoxification strategies have been observed in fe-deficient roots  <cit> , the increase in rfo concentration could help to alleviate ros damage produced under fe deficiency. moderate increases in sugars commonly found in cell walls such as cellobiose, xylonic acid and arabinose, which may indicate cell wall modifications, were measured in sugar beet fe-deficient root tips. changes in cell wall metabolism have been also described in fe-deficient tomato roots  <cit> . on the other hand, it has been described that cell wall damage generates oligosaccharides that can act as signalling molecules in stresses such as wounding  <cit> . the increase in rfos could also act as a long distance fe-deficiency signal via phloem sap transport. this is the first description of rfos accumulation in plants under fe deficiency, and the physiological implications of this increase deserve further consideration.

most of the proteins found to be up-accumulated in sugar beet root tips by fe deficiency were identified as carbohydrate catabolism enzymes, including  <dig> of the  <dig> glycolytic pathway enzymes , one of the citric acid cycle  and fructokinase. increases in the activities and concentrations of several glycolytic enzymes in root extracts with fe deficiency have been previously found, including fructose  <dig> -bisphosphate aldolase, enolase, triosephosphate isomerase and gadph  <cit> . also, increases in the activities and concentrations of several enzymes of the citric acid cycle with fe deficiency have been previously reported in root extracts, including mdh  <cit> . results are also in agreement with microarray gene analysis in fe-deficient a. thaliana roots  <cit> . increases in the amount of pepc have been found at the protein level  <cit> , but this enzyme, with a molecular mass of  <dig> kda, was not in the range  used in our 2-d gels. up-regulation of carbohydrate catabolism in roots of plants grown in fe deficient conditions is probably a result of an increased demand of energy and reducing power in roots needed to sustain the increased activity of h+-atpase and fe reductase  <cit> . also, two spots corresponding to different subunits of f <dig> atp synthase increased in 2-d gels from fe deficient root tips, further supporting the higher energy requirement in these roots. moreover, our results show an increase in the amount of formate dehydrogenase, an enzyme related to the anaerobic respiration, in fe-deficient roots, confirming the results of enzyme  <cit>  and transcriptional  <cit>  analysis. anaerobic respiration is an alternative pathway for energy production when oxidative phosphorylation is impaired.

metabolite studies revealed large increases in organic acids, including a 20-fold citric acid increase. these increases in tca cycle organic acids with fe deficiency are coupled with increases in glycolysis  <cit>  and root c fixation by pepc  <cit> , and provide an anaplerotic, non-autotrophic  c source for leaves which have otherwise reduced photosynthetic rates  <cit> . malate and citrate could also be pumped from the cytosol to the mitochondria via a di-tricarboxylate carrier  where they would allow a higher turnover of reducing equivalents  <cit> . a significant decrease  in oxalic acid concentration was observed in fe deficient root tips, and similar decreases  have been reported in fe-deficient tomato roots  <cit> . the implications of oxalate concentration decreases with fe deficiency are still not known, since the role of oxalic acid in plants is quite different from that of the other organic acids, and for a long time it has been considered as a toxin or a metabolic end product  <cit> . regarding n and amino-acid compounds, a large increase  was measured for nicotianamine, which has been described to play a role in cytosolic fe availability  <cit> .

a comprehensive representation of the metabolomic and proteomic changes taking place in root tips under fe deficiency and resupply is shown in figure  <dig>  red and yellow symbols indicate major and moderate increases in metabolites  and proteins  compared to the fe-sufficient controls. blue and green symbols indicate major and moderate decreases in metabolites  and proteins  compared to the controls. besides the major increases in rfos and dmrl, fe deficiency induced significant changes in root tip metabolism, mainly associated to increases in carbohydrate catabolism, glycolysis and tca cycle and to a lesser extent in aminoacid and nitrogen metabolism . similar changes were observed in the  <dig> and 72h yz fe-resupplied roots, whereas the wz of  <dig> h fe-resupplied plants did not show major changes when compared to +fe plants . on the other hand, the relative amount of lipid metabolism compounds did not change markedly in fe-deficient roots, whereas fe resupply caused a moderate increase in this type of metabolites .

CONCLUSIONS
the proteomic and metabolic profiles of root tips from sugar beet plants were affected by fe deficiency and resupply. changes in the glycolysis and tca cycle metabolites and proteins confirmed previous studies. two novel and major findings were the increase in i) dmrl synthase protein concentration and gene expression, and ii) some rfo sugars . these new findings give new perspectives to the knowledge of fe deficiency.
