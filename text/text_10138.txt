BACKGROUND
hepatotoxicity is one of the most commonly observed adverse effects in response to many environmental and toxic exposures and is of major concern in the drug development industry  <cit> . the liver's response to insults depends on the properties of the stressor, the dose received and if the exposure is acute or chronic. examples of injury or damage are fatty liver, necrosis, cholestasis, cirrhosis and cancer. traditionally, the detection of a stressor's toxicity relies on the evaluation of serum enzyme levels that are indicators of tissue damage  <cit> . for instance, elevations of alt and ast are indicative of liver damage  <cit> . they are associated with inflammation and\or injury to hepatocytes. necrosis of the liver usually results in hepatocellular plasma membrane leakage of ast and alt into the bloodstream. however, although the elevated levels of these serum enzymes are indicators of hepatocellular damage, they are poor prognosticators for the severity of the liver injury or acute liver failure. the ability to predict necrosis at the molecular level, the extent  of damage and the source of the insult is currently a challenge using classical toxicologic assays, parameters and biomarkers.

microarray analysis has evolved as a reliable technology to survey the expression of genes across an entire genome  <cit> . several efforts have shown that gene expression signatures can be "anchored" to the phenotype of biological samples  <cit>  and even characterize the genetic variability in individuals  <cit> . the possibilities of phenotypic anchoring are promising and just beginning to take form in investigations from toxicogenomics and risk assessment to pharmacogenomics and personalized medicine. ultimately, the success of these efforts relies on the identification of genes and gene products that are considered biomarkers of toxicity or candidates of susceptibility to health conditions. recently, bushel et al.  <cit>  have shown that rat blood gene expression signatures are predictive of the toxic exposure to acetaminophen and can be used to monitor the exposure of the toxicant reflected in the human blood and in the rat liver. the study was based on a single hepatotoxicant which targeted a specific region of the rat liver , addressed discrimination of non\sub-toxic vs toxic  and overdose exposure levels and demonstrated the superiority of gene expression markers over traditional clinical parameters in predicting the exposure. a more comprehensive analysis of compound-induced liver injury was performed ab initio using samples exposed to hepatotoxicants or compounds without known liver toxicity  <cit> . expression profiles from  <dig> genes combined with a composite hepatotoxicity score were highly predictive of compound-induced liver injury. it would be useful to be able to identify gene expression patterns as a diagnostic signature for prediction of the  level of necrosis as the general phenotypic response that is commonly manifested from toxic exposure to a compendium of stressors which targets various regions of the liver.

in our study, gene expression data from rat livers exposed to a compendium of hepatotoxicants  was used to identify gene expression patterns as a diagnostic signature which predicts the level of necrosis of the liver with a high degree of accuracy. the eight chemical compounds in the compendium  elicit some or no hepatotoxicity in male rat liver samples at one or more of the three time points . a form of necrosis was the major lesion observed in a region of the liver from the toxic doses of the chemicals. analysis of the liver and blood gene expression data using svm classifiers within each dose\time group separately for each tissue type revealed compound-specific separation of the samples exposed to the hepatotoxicant . interestingly, the blood data consistently performed better than the liver data in separating the samples into compound groups in the majority of the dose\time point groups. to investigate the ability of liver genomic markers to predict the level of necrosis manifested in the livers of the animals exposed to the hepatotoxicants, we utilized a random forest classifier with an out-of-bag classification error and variable importance estimation procedure to select gene predictors of three classes of the level of necrosis that were derived according to 1) the five severity scores of the injury 2) the differentially expressed genes from an anova model and 3) the gene ontology biological processes enrichment shared by adjacent necrosis levels. from this strategy, gene expression profiles from  <dig> informative genes were identified as a diagnostic signature which achieved 90%, 80% and 60% prediction accuracies of the level of necrosis against independent test data derived from rats exposed to acetaminophen, carbon tetrachloride, and allyl alcohol, respectively. in addition, it was determined that inflammation follows programmed cell death in response to the hepatotoxicants and the cytotoxic effects of tnf-α as well as a transcriptional regulation by jun and tp <dig>  and apoptosis-related genes possibly lead to necrosis.

RESULTS
manifestation of necrosis
we used a data set containing  <dig> hepatotoxicants  to identify genes related to necrosis level. table  <dig> shows the distribution of the severity level of the animals in each compound studied. the necrosis severity included five levels: none, minimum, mild, moderate and marked. none represents no sign of necrosis, minimal represents less than 5% of hepatocytes show necrosis, mild represents 5%–25% of hepatocytes are necrotic, moderate means 26%–50% of hepatocytes show necrosis and marked means more than 50% of liver cells are necrotic.

gene expression changes transition with severity of necrosis
given the groups of samples according to the manifestation of hepatocyte necrosis, we extracted genes from the microarray data that have expression levels that are significantly different between severity levels. the severity levels of necrosis were transformed to indicator variables  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> denoting none, minimal, mild, moderate and marked necrosis, respectively. an unbalanced one-way anova was constructed with the level of necrosis as the only factor. to find significantly differentially expressed genes between two adjacent necrosis levels, four estimations of the comparison of necrosis score  <dig> vs.  <dig>   <dig> vs.  <dig>   <dig> vs.  <dig> and  <dig> vs.  <dig> were performed. table  <dig> summarizes the number of differentially expressed genes between two adjacent necrosis scores under a series of bonferroni multi-test correction thresholds. the number of significant differentially expressed genes for comparisons of necrosis score  <dig> vs.  <dig> and score  <dig> vs.  <dig> are much fewer than that for comparison of necrosis score  <dig> vs.  <dig> and score  <dig> vs.  <dig>  this suggests that the expression of genes in the samples of the liver between minimal and mild necrosis and between moderate and marked necrosis are not much different. the bulk of the difference is between liver samples with no necrosis and those with minimal necrosis and between those with mild necrosis and with moderate necrosis.

* a total of  <dig>  genes from the agilent platform were tested.

inflammation follows programmed cell death in response to hepatotoxicant exposure
gene ontology analysis was performed on four lists of significantly differentially expressed genes from the comparisons of two adjacent necrosis scores which met the bonferroni  <dig>  threshold. figure  <dig> shows gominer analysis of over-expressed genes from the four lists of gene. the over-expressed genes in the comparison of necrosis score  <dig> vs.  <dig> and score  <dig> vs.  <dig> do not show any significant biological processes, while the over-expressed genes in the comparison of necrosis score  <dig> vs.  <dig> and  <dig> vs.  <dig> yielded several significant biological processes. one example is the biological process for inflammatory response. it is over-represented in the gene set discriminating necrosis level  <dig> and  <dig> but not when comparing level  <dig> and  <dig>  the programmed cell death pathway is over-represented in this latter comparison. therefore, it appears that after exposure of the liver to these hepatotoxicants in rats, programmed cell death is activated in the samples that exhibited mild or minimal necrosis while the inflammatory response is activated in the liver samples showing moderate or marked necrosis. these results, suggesting that inflammation follows programmed cell death, are in-line with recent finding that the mechanisms by which apoptosis promotes an inflammatory response may be related to death receptor-initiated signaling cascades  <cit> .

both the anova statistical analysis and gominer biological processes analysis resulted in the conclusion that the gene expression, biological pathways and processes in the liver samples that manifest minimal or mild necrosis are very similar and difficult to differentiate from one another. the same is the case for liver samples revealing moderate or marked necrosis. however, the biological response in the liver of the samples with necrosis level comparisons of none vs. minimum and mild vs. moderate resulted in significant biological differences. thus, for the purpose of this study, we combined the five necrosis severity scores into three necrosis levels,  in order to identify genes that can predict the level of necrosis with a high degree of certainty from samples that share a common biological response. in the end, the sample size in each level increases and the statistical power to differentiate the newly defined levels of necrosis improves.

gene classifiers that predict necrosis
selection of predictor genes
first, a one-way anova was fitted to extract the significant differentially expressed genes among the three newly defined necrosis levels. the same one-way anova model as described above was applied with the modification that the necrosis level now was from  <dig> to  <dig> instead of from severity score  <dig> to  <dig>  three contrasts were performed to identify differentially expressed genes between level  <dig> vs.  <dig>   <dig> vs.  <dig> and  <dig> vs.  <dig>  from this analysis,  <dig> genes were significantly differentially expressed either in the contrast of level  <dig> vs.  <dig> or in the contrast of level  <dig> vs.  <dig> using bonferroni multi-test correction at p-value threshold of  <dig>  . gene ontology analysis performed on the two gene lists generated from the  <dig> vs.  <dig> and  <dig> vs.  <dig> level comparisons from the redefined groups reconfirms that inflammation follows programmed cell death when the samples are exposed to the hepatotoxicants . inflammation is significant only in the  <dig> vs.  <dig> comparison while program cell death is more significant in  <dig> vs.  <dig> comparison.

for building a model for prediction, all the normalized data from the  <dig> arrays  were used as a training set. the three necrosis levels were used as the class labels and the  <dig> genes as the predictors. random forest and gems-svm were two classification approaches used for prediction.

prediction with random forest
the random forest classification method selected  <dig> genes which have an out-of-bag  data error rate of  <dig>  and standard deviation of  <dig> . the names and annotation of the  <dig> selected genes are listed in table  <dig>  the list contains several genes related to inflammatory disease, cell-to-cell signaling and interaction, cell death, cellular movement, immune response, and cell organization.

prediction with gems
classifiers used for prediction can be data dependent. therefore, we also used the gene expression model selector  approach for prediction. the best performing model selected by gems used a gene selection method consisting of a signal-to-noise ratio in a one-versus-rest fashion followed by a multicategory support vector machines method by weston and watkins  <cit> . six genes were selected from the prediction model achieving a minimum cross validation error with prediction accuracy of  <dig> % on the training data . five of the six genes were also selected as predictors using the random forest approach except for inosine monophosphate  dehydrogenase  <dig>  this gene catalyzes the rate-limiting reaction of de novo gtp biosynthesis at the inosine monophosphate metabolic branch point and therefore is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation. the prediction results on the training and test data from both classifiers are showed .

* overlap with the  <dig> selected agilent probes using random forest

comparison of results between random forest and gems
the same average prediction accuracy of  <dig> % on the training data was achieved using the  <dig> genes selected by random forest and the  <dig> genes selected by the gems-svm classifier . comparison of the prediction calls for the training data set from the two approaches indicates that the gems-svm approach tends to misclassify samples towards the lower end of the necrosis level than the random forest approach . assessing the prediction accuracy for each compound in the training data set revealed that different compounds show different prediction accuracies, ranging from  <dig> % to 100% . the thioacetamide, monocrotaline, galactosamine, and diquat exposed samples always showed lower prediction accuracies  using both the random forest and gems-svm approaches. the bromobenzene,  <dig> -dichlorobenzene and n-nitrosomorpholine exposed samples were typically predicted with accuracies greater than 94% using either the random forest or gems-svm approaches. the samples exposed to <dig> -dichlorobenzene show better prediction accuracy using the random forest approach than the gems-svm approach.

both the random forest classifier and gems-svm classifier misclassified  <dig> animals from the training set. there are  <dig> animals in the overlap; thus, a total of  <dig> animals were misclassified either from the random forest approach or from the gems-svm approach. further verification using clinical chemistry data was performed for animals where there was disagreement between the predicted necrosis level and the necrosis class label according to the redefined groups . the correlation analysis  and scatter plot  were performed on the data to identify the concordance of log2alt/log2ast level, the predicted class label, and the necrosis class label based on the redefined groups. the random forest and gems-svm predicted labels for the misclassified samples were more consistent with alt and ast levels than the necrosis class label . the random forest and gems-svm predicted labels for the correctly classified samples were just as consistent  with log2alt and log2ast levels as the necrosis class label . this result corroborates our prediction call. comparing the scatter plot colored by the random forest predicted label  vs. colored by the gems-svm predicted label  on those misclassified samples revealed that the random forest method tends to predict the samples more towards a severe necrosis level while the gems-svm approach tends to predict them towards a less severe necrosis level . figure  <dig> is a principal component analysis  on all  <dig> training animals using the  <dig> selected genes illustrating the level of necrosis separated along the pc <dig>  figure 3a is colored by the necrosis class label and figure 3b is colored by the predicted label. both figures show that the level of necrosis increases from left to right along the pc <dig> 

to validate the prediction using the selected genes, the classifier was applied to the test data. the chemical compounds in the testing data sets  include three different studies of rat livers exposed to acetaminophen, one to carbon tetrachloride and one to allyl alcohol. when the random forest classifier was applied to the acetaminophen-treated sample data, the prediction accuracies were  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively for the data sets from the national center for toxicogenomics study # <dig> , national toxicology program  and national center for toxicogenomics informatics challenge study . the random forest classifier produced  <dig> % prediction accuracy for the carbon tetrachloride-treated test samples. surprisingly, only  <dig> % prediction accuracy was achieved with the classifier applied to the allyl alcohol-treated test samples . similarly, the gems-svm classifier with the  <dig> predictive genes achieved prediction accuracies of  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively for three acetaminophen data sets from nct <dig>  ntp and nct informatics challenge. in the case of the carbon tetrachloride test samples, the gems-svm classifier achieved the same prediction accuracy  as the random forest classifier. not surprisingly, similar to the random forest prediction of the test data, the gems-svm classifier model performed poorly on the allyl alcohol sample set achieving only 59% prediction accuracy. generally speaking, the gems-svm classifier model performed slightly worse than the random forest model on the test data, probably due to the smaller number of genes in the former model.

to test the significance of the  <dig> genes in the classifier  <dig>  samples were generated by randomly selecting  <dig> genes from the array to use for training of the random forest classifier and testing on the test data. the median prediction accuracy for the  <dig>  randomly generated samples is 70%. about  <dig> % of the random samples achieved a prediction accuracy greater than 76%. only  <dig> out of the  <dig>  samples achieved prediction accuracy greater than or equal to  <dig>  . therefore, the significance of the prediction accuracy of the selected  <dig> genes in the random forest classifier has a p-value <  <dig> .

biological pathway and gene network analyses
pathway analysis of the  <dig> predictor genes revealed a central regulating role of tumor necrosis factor , jun and tp <dig> . the majority of the predictor genes  are regulated in their expression by those transcription factors. bayesian gene networks were reconstructed using the discretized expression profile of all mapped genes from the training samples. the edges between the genes denote inferred interactions. animals treated with a low dose  of the agents don't usually manifest necrosis. only samples treated with a high dose  of the agents were selected  for reconstruction of the bayesian networks. the networks with the highest posterior probability of the model given the data were collected from a large number of heuristic searches. the frequency distribution histogram  details the number of edges that reoccur in the  <dig> networks that were reconstructed. there are potentially  <dig> edges for the  <dig> genes used to generate the networks ,  <dig> edges not presented ,  <dig> edges presented over  <dig> times, and  <dig> edges presented between  <dig> and  <dig> times. the probability of each edge being presented was calculated using weighted average scoring. figure  <dig> shows the consensus network recreated using the highest scoring network from each of the  <dig> runs of the algorithm, including all edges with a probability of being presented greater than  <dig> . four gene-to-gene interactions  with probabilities greater than  <dig>  are consistent with the interactions in the biological pathway generated from curation of scientific literature .

discussion
hepatotoxicants particularly target the liver and cause a variety of liver injuries. one type of damage is necrosis, a degenerative process leading to cell death. we analyzed a compendium of gene expression data  acquired from rat livers exposed to hepatotoxicants in an attempt to define gene expression patterns as a signatures that are highly predictive of the level of necrosis. we used necrosis as a phenotypic anchor to identify genes which predict the level of necrosis of the rat liver with a high degree of accuracy.

a prevailing advantage of our study was identifying genes related to necrosis which may be directly related to cell death caused by exposure to the compounds while filtering out genes related to other mechanisms related to a single compound. this was accomplished by using the histopathologic class label of the biological samples for necrosis as defined by board certified pathologists. we then leveraged anova pairwise contrasts of the severity groups and gominer analysis of the gene expression data to subset the samples into groups with similar phenotypic changes exhibited by necrosis of the liver and comparable overrepresentation of biological processes . using these groups as class labels for the level of necrosis in the training set and two gene selectionification approaches , we were able to identify subsets of genes which yielded a low prediction error rate during cross validation of the classifiers. preliminary analysis of the liver gene expression data within each dose\time group by lobenhofer et al.  revealed compound-specific separation of the samples. although classification of the blood data was better in higher dose groups at the later time points as compared to the liver data, classifiers derived from it was not able to predict animals in some cases where the hepatotoxicant elicited a different phenotypic response with the animals of a particular dose\time group. interestingly, concordance analysis of alt and ast enzyme levels with the class label of the level of necrosis and our predicted class labels revealed that the latter is more consistent with the enzyme levels. one potential reason for this could be that the microarray samples are from the whole liver whereas the histopathology samples used for scoring the extent of necrosis are only from two independent slices of the liver specimen. in a limited study, heinloth et al.  <cit>  also showed that gene expression analysis is more informative than histopathologic evaluations and offers unique advantages to liver biopsy evaluations. another explanation could be that certain animals may develop the phenotype at a later time point after treatment than the time point when the samples were taken for analysis. therefore, the histopathology samples may not completely represent the liver toxicity. however, our gene expression analysis, redefining of the class labels for the level of necrosis exhibited in the samples and selection of predictor genes for necrosis are geared towards capturing the biological processes and mechanistic pathways that may govern the manifestation of the phenotype from a low level of necrosis to its highest level.

using independent gene expression data sets acquired from the exposure of rat liver samples to a different set of hepatotoxicants, we show that the prediction accuracies of either of the two classifiers were roughly 80% overall but approximately 90%, about 80% and around 60% for acetaminophen-, carbon tetrachloride- and allyl alcohol-exposed samples, respectively with a p-value <  <dig>  for the significance of the prediction using the random forest classifier . the dramatic difference in prediction accuracy could be related to bioactivation mechanisms involved in the manifestation of centrilobular necrosis in the case of acetaminophen- and carbon tetrachloride-toxicity as opposed to periportal necrosis in the case of allyl alcohol-toxicity. in the former, the abundance of cytochrome p <dig> plays a critical role whereas in the latter, higher oxygen levels are responsible  <cit> . another reason may be a site-specific batch effect since the allyl alcohol microarray data was generated at a different location than the acetaminophen and carbon tetrachloride microarray data. the training and testing samples are plotted together using pca of the expression data from the signature of the  <dig> selected genes . the testing samples show similar distributions as the training samples and also indicate that the necrosis level increases from right to left along pc <dig>  the acetaminophen- and carbon tetrachloride – exposed samples show a similar data dispersion range as the training samples while the ally alcohol – exposed samples are more compressed along the first pc.

genes from our predictive models  have biological functions related to the regulation of apoptosis  or are involved in a chemokine\inflammatory response , cxcl <dig> and lgals <dig>  pathway analysis of the predictor genes revealed a central regulating role of tumor necrosis factor , jun and tp <dig> . the majority of the predictor genes in the signature  are regulated in their expression by these transcription factors. therefore, our results are generally in agreement with the current hypothesis that tnf mediates liver injury and genes such as jun and tp <dig> are closely involved in necrotic changes in response to exposure to some hepatotoxicants  <cit> . surprisingly, monocyte chemoattractant protein- <dig> , a serum factor gene and chemokine that is in our predictor gene list, was shown to have its protein product differentially expressed in acetaminophen-treated rats  <cit>  and is induced by tnf-α  <cit> . this regulation might be a reflection of a repair process following liver injury by acetaminophen-toxic exposure or could be a contributor to the insult. although the role of mcp- <dig> in liver injury is controversial  <cit> , new evidence using mcp- <dig> deficient mice suggests that interference of the gene's expression is sufficient for altering the processes that lead to severe carbon tetrachloride-induced liver injury  <cit> . however, caution must be taken as a more complicated biological response to liver injury is likely since there are hepatotoxicants, such as monocrotaline – , where an inflammatory response ensues secondarily to injury of the liver and tnf-α appears to not be primarily responsible for the hepatotoxicity  <cit> . in addition, transcription factors such as tnf-α and tp <dig> have both pro- and anti-apoptotic effects. tp <dig> keeps the cell from progressing through the cell cycle if there is damage to dna but can also cause the cell to enter apoptosis if the damage cannot be repaired. similarly, tnf-α can induce pro-apoptotic signaling mechanisms  <cit>  or induce resistance against apoptosis  <cit>  depending on the overall condition of the cell and its microenvironment.

the reconstructed bayesian network from the toxic exposures of the hepatotoxicants  revealed several gene interactions that are consistent with interactions in the pathway that was generated from curated scientific literature  and points to apoptosis-related genes in necrosis-mediated toxicity. bear in mind that the network is a consensus one, has only positive, one-way, acyclic interactions and was generated from microarray data alone using a limited number of genes. however, the confidence of each gene-to-gene edge  was calculated by performing  <dig> simulated annealing searches.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated that gene expression signatures can predict, with a high degree of accuracy, the severity of necrosis of the liver elicited by acute exposure of rats to a variety of hepatotoxicants. first, the class discovery approach using anova and gominer pathway analysis provided well-defined groups. this step is important since the redefined groups are more correlated with the liver injury as measured by alt and ast enzyme levels. in addition, the gene selection strategy using random forest and gems-svm improved the accuracy of predicting the severity of necrosis. furthermore, the gene expression signature led to the identification of the molecular pathways that exhibited biological relevance to the manifestation of necrosis. finally, pathway and gene network analyses revealed several gene interactions suggesting that apoptosis may be a consequence of the chain of events stemming from drug-induced liver injury and it leads to, or is concomitant with, the manifestation of necrosis of the liver from exposure of the hepatotoxicants in rats.
