BACKGROUND
escherichia coli cause a wide variety of diseases in humans and animals, carrying a significant public health and economic burden. most e. coli isolates can be grouped into  <dig> broad phylogroups, termed a, b <dig>  b <dig>  c, d, e and f, based on the distribution of a number of target genes and multi-locus sequencing typing  methods  <cit> . dispersed across these phylogroups are several pathotypes, including extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli  such as uropathogenic  and neonatal meningitis-associated , and intestinal pathogenic e. coli  including enterohaemorrhagic , enteropathogenic , and enterotoxigenic  strains.

generally, a correlative relationship can be seen between pathotypes and phylogroups - e. coli from phylogroups b <dig>  d and f are predominantly associated with extraintestinal diseases , and these phylogroups are enriched with genomic elements which facilitate their pathogenesis - including iron acquisition systems  and adhesins  <cit>  - often housed on mobile genomic islands encoded in the chromosome , or contained within plasmids  <cit> . in contrast, e. coli from phylogroup a, b <dig>  c and e, are less commonly associated with extraintestinal disease  <cit> , although there may be some geographic variation to this trend  <cit> . these e. coli are more typically associated with intestinal commensalism or disease, and include the ehec o157:h <dig> group  infamous for several deadly outbreaks across the globe , the recent european epidemic o104:h <dig> group   <cit> , and etec o78:h <dig> str. h <dig>   <cit> . counter-intuitively, e. coli from classical expec groups are also frequently isolated as human intestinal commensals, and successfully compete with resident intestinal microflora to colonise the human gut in the absence of gastro-intestinal disease  <cit> . they may constitute the predominant faecal commensal e. coli type in a significant proportion of healthy humans  <cit> , and many of the pais which impact on expec disease also function as intestinal colonisation fitness factors .

this general trend of phylogroup/pathotype association is not without exception, and isolates belonging to a particular phylogroup can exhibit the pathogenicity more typical of another. for example, one of the most closely studied intestinal pathogens, epec o127:h <dig> str. e2348/ <dig>  belongs to phylogroup b <dig>  <cit>  yet houses the lee type  <dig> secretion system   <cit> ; a virulence factor typically associated with ehec from phylogroup e. like many of the expec pais, the t3ss is conferred on a mobile genetic element, which has facilitated the dissemination of lee and the attaching and effacing phenotype amongst disparate strains  <cit> . similarly to the transmission of the t3ss to e2348/ <dig>  a previous investigation of closely related apec and upec strains from phylogroup c identified a virulence plasmid in these strains more usually associated with typical expecs  <cit> . these isolates, which may be considered ‘pathotype switchers’, can offer an invaluable resource for investigating the genetic basis for expec disease as they illuminate those components which, when acquired into an ancestrally non-expec genome, may engender disease.

in this paper, we investigate the genomic evolution of extraintestinal pathogenesis in an isolate of e. coli termed ms <dig>  this phylogroup b <dig> isolate was collected from clinical bovine metritis and can recreate extra-intestinal disease in a mouse model of infection  <cit> . using a range of bioinformatic approaches, we have identified regions of the ms <dig> genome that are much more frequently associated with the genomes of extraintestinal pathogens from phylogroups b <dig>  d or f, than they are with other isolates from phylogroup b <dig>  we suggest that this expec-associated dna within the genome of ms <dig> has been horizontally acquired during its recent evolutionary history, and we speculate that the recruitment of this dna into the ms <dig> genome has expanded the niche of this isolate, and allows it  to cause extraintestinal disease. the acquired dna disproportionately encodes several functional classes of genes, including those involved in adhesion and those directed to the outer membrane or extracellular space. these data help illuminate key components in the genetic basis for extraintestinal pathogenesis in e. coli, and demonstrate the adaptability of this species in its evolution to exploit multiple environments.

RESULTS
ms <dig> is a member of an emerging expec lineage
e. coli strain ms <dig>  was isolated from a case of bovine metritis, and previously shown to reproduce extra-intestinal disease in a mouse model of intrauterine infection  <cit> . in light of the ability for ms <dig> to cause extraintestinal disease in animals, we investigated whether e. coli similar to ms <dig> had been isolated from other extraintestinal infections. we searched the literature for reference to this sequence type  and found seven recent publications describing eight st <dig> isolates, five of which are isolates from human urinary tract infections across the globe . the remaining three isolates, alongside two further unpublished isolates found in the e. coli mlst database , are isolated from the faeces of humans or animals in the absence of disease. these data revealed a striking mirror of the epidemiological profile of traditional expecs  in this phylogroup b <dig> lineage, and demonstrate increasing evidence for the ability of st <dig> e. coli to cause extra-intestinal disease. since this group is outwith the previously dominantly represented, and well characterised, expec lineages from phylogroups b <dig>  d and f, we speculate that st <dig> may represent a distinct and potentially emerging expec lineage.table  <dig>

overview of the ms <dig> genome
our investigation of the ms <dig> genome sequence  <cit>   revealed that, in addition to the chromosome, this sequence contained several contigs which exhibited marked homology to colv-type plasmids found in a number of expecs including apec o <dig>  s <dig> and several plasmids isolated from extra-intestinal pathogenic salmonella enterica serovar kentucky isolates , which have been proposed to underpin their virulence  <cit> . a similar plasmid was also recently described in an expec isolate from phylogroup c  <cit> , indicating that the putative ms <dig> plasmid could also play a role in virulence. indeed, many of the traits associated with expecs can be conferred when similar plasmids have been experimentally introduced into non-pathogenic e. coli
 <cit> . among the fitness, colonisation and virulence factors encoded on the putative ms <dig> plasmid are those which may provide resistance against several antibiotics, including beta-lactams, tetracyclines and macrolides. the presence of these plasmid sequences in ms <dig>  and similar plasmids in the genomes of other st <dig>  isolates may explain the some of the antibiotic resistance previously observed in these strains .

our preliminary investigation of the ms <dig> chromosome revealed several features in the genome of this isolate which we did not anticipate, and could be related to the ability for ms <dig> to cause expec infection. these included the yersiniabactin iron uptake system, implicated in the virulence of a number of expecs  <cit> , the pix fimbrial locus, previously identified in the upec strains x <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> , and a group  <dig> extracellular polysaccharide capsule locus with similarity to that described in the sepsis-associated isolate cp <dig>  <cit> .

regions of the ms <dig> genome show association with expecs
in light of the fact that st <dig> contained several examples of isolates from extra-intestinal infection, we speculated that, as a representative of st <dig>  ms <dig> may possess genes which enable it to behave more similarly to typical expecs within phylogroup b <dig>  d or f, than to members of its phylogenetic family . we reasoned that regions of the ms <dig> genome that are more frequently found in expecs than within phylogroup b <dig> organisms would be likely to contain candidate genes to be involved in the ms <dig> expec phenotype. to investigate this, we sought to compare the ms <dig> genome to two groups of sequences; one of typical expec genomes, and the second of genomes from the phylogroup b <dig> relatives of ms <dig>  to populate these groups with a sufficient number of sequences for robust comparative analysis, we elaborated the phylogenetic relationship between  <dig> e. coli genome sequences available in the ncbi sequence database at the outset of the study, and approximated their isolation source using the data available at ncbi . we partitioned  <dig> genomes into the expec group, and  <dig> genomes into the b <dig> group - further details of the genomes assigned to each group are shown in the table in additional file  <dig>  due to the large number of genomes in this analysis bootstrapping of this tree was not possible, so a subset of these sequences were taken for phylogenetic analysis with bootstrapping in order to support the branching pattern, which showed strong support for our tree .

rather than focusing entirely on previously-defined genes for our comparative analysis, we performed an unbiased analysis in order to identify any region of the ms <dig> genome which displayed a significantly greater association with sequences in the expec group than those within the phylogroup b <dig> group. to do this we investigated the frequency of homologous sequences to 1 kb ‘windows’ of the ms <dig> genome in the b <dig> or expec sequence groups. the resulting data allowed us to calculate the difference in frequency between the two groups, which is expressed on a scale from − <dig> to + <dig>  representing windows more frequent in b <dig> than expecs , regions of no difference between the groups  and windows more frequent in expecs than b <dig> . the main panels in figure  <dig> represent this frequency difference along the length of the ms <dig> chromosome  and plasmid , according to the scale presented to the right of the image. the grey circles on the main panels represent results of a statistical analysis  to identify windows significantly associated with either group. since regions of no difference  do not discriminate between regions of shared commonality  or shared rarity , the top panel for the chromosome and plasmid tracks the total frequency in the b <dig> group  and expec group  independently.figure  <dig>

the association between the ms <dig> genome and the phylogroup b <dig> or expecs groups. the scale to the left of the image describes the colours which indicate a difference in frequency between the phylogroup b <dig> group  and expec group . these colours are used to represent query windows across the length of the ms <dig> chromosome  and plasmid , where regions more frequently found in expecs than b1s are red, regions of no difference between the two groups are white, while regions more frequently found in b1s than expecs are blue. significance values on the y-axis are the results of two-tailed fisher’s exact test to determine whether a query window is significantly associated with either group, and the results for each query window are represented on the graph by semi-transparent grey circles . regions of dna which appear white in the main panel do not differentiate between query windows which are uniformly common or uniformly rare, therefore the line graphs presented above the main panels track the frequency of each window in the b <dig> group  and expec group  independently. these data indicate that approximately 4% of the ms <dig> chromosome  and 52% of the putative ms <dig> plasmid  are significantly associated with the expec group .



the data in figure  <dig> revealed some striking features of the ms <dig> genome, with numerous regions clearly associated with either the b <dig> or the expec group. our analysis of these data showed that approximately  <dig> % of the ms <dig> chromosome is significantly enriched in the b <dig> group - this result was anticipated, since ms <dig> is a phylogroup b <dig> strain. these regions encode several metabolic loci  and a number of genes involved in the production of extracellular structures including fimbrial and autotransporter genes. conversely, we found a surprisingly large fraction  of the chromosomal windows to be significantly enriched in the expec group compared to the b <dig> group. several prominent expec associated regions are visible in the chromosome of ms <dig>  particularly a block at approximately  <dig> kbp, which is the product of  <dig> consecutive windows which are strongly associated with the expec-group in contrast to the b <dig> group, and coincides with the yersiniabactin siderophore system locus. in addition, the ms <dig> plasmid appears predominantly expec-associated, with approximately 54% showing a strong, significant association with expecs. a full list of b1-enriched and expec-enriched genes is included in additional file 4).

ms <dig> is more expec-like than is typical for other b <dig> isolates
in total, we calculated that  <dig> % of the ms <dig> genome  is significantly more prevalent in the genomes of expecs compared to phylogroup b <dig>  which raised the question as to how typical this was for phylogroup b <dig> genomes in general. to investigate this, we investigated the amount of expec-associated dna found within  <dig> other genomes across the spectrum of phylogroup b <dig>  and calculated this as a percentage of their genome length .figure  <dig> 
the percentage genomic association with the expec group compared with the phylogroup b <dig> group in a range of phylogroup b <dig> genomes. on average,  <dig> % of a phylogroup b <dig> genome contains dna which is more frequently found in expecs . by contrast,  <dig> % of the ms <dig> genome  is more frequently found in expecs - a 33% increase on the average. isolates which have been recovered from intestinal sites are coloured blue, while those which have been recovered from extra-intestinal sites are coloured red . isolates belonging to st <dig> are annotated with a black circle next to the name. this detail shows that all the identified st <dig> strains contain more than the average quantity of expec-associated dna that is typical for phylogroup b <dig> genomes.



figure  <dig> reveals that ms <dig> encodes an atypically high percentage of expec-associated dna, in comparison to the average of what may be expected for a phylogroup b <dig> genome. from the  <dig> phylogroup b <dig> genomes investigated, ms <dig> ranks third in the greatest amount of expec-associated dna contained within a genome. furthermore, the two higher ranking isolates , along with other top ranking isolates , are all st <dig> strains very closely related to ms <dig> , whilst o <dig> was also isolated from extra-intestinal infection  <cit> . the increased amount of expec-associated dna in the ms <dig> genome relative to the average for phylogroup b <dig> equates to approximately  <dig> kbp.

gene families over-represented in the ms <dig> expec-associated dna
the surprising association of approximately  <dig> % of the ms <dig> genome with expecs led us to investigate the function of the genes within these regions, as we presume that these directly influence the ability for ms <dig> to cause extraintestinal disease. we identified  <dig> chromosomal and  <dig> plasmid-borne genes which localised to the expec-associated windows . key genes which have previously been implicated as important to expec virulence and, we speculate, are crucial to the ms <dig> expec phenotype – are listed in table  <dig>  unexpected among these was type i fimbriae which, although found widely in e. coli, have been linked with expec pathogenicity  <cit> . the fim genes were, surprisingly, underrepresented in phylogroup b <dig> genomes compared with expec genomes, hence, they emerged as a significant correlate.table  <dig>

in addition to the role for the characterised expec determinants, we speculated that the expec-associated genes may enrich ms <dig> for certain functional classes of protein and facilitate extraintestinal pathogenesis. to investigate this, we examined the ‘biological process’ gene ontology  annotations  <cit>  , and psortb sub-cellular predictions  <cit>  , for the expec-associated genes compared with other genes in the ms <dig> genome .

this analysis revealed several functional classes and localisations of genes to be over-represented in the expec-associated dna of ms <dig>  compared to that which constitutes the non-expec dna . statistical investigation  indicate that genes involved in biological processes including “death”  , “biological adhesion” , “multi-organism processes” , and “cellular organisation” , are all significantly over-represented in the ms <dig> expec-associated dna. for the predicted subcellular localisation, these data indicate that genes whose products are directed to the outer membrane or extracellular space are also over-represented in the expec-associated genes, genes localised to the cytoplasmic membrane show no difference, while genes localised to the cytoplasm or periplasm are significantly under-represented.figure  <dig> 
a comparison of the relative abundance of biological process gene ontology classifications  and subcellular localisation predictions  for the ms <dig> non-expec genome  versus the ms <dig> expec-associated genome . these data show that the expec-associated dna in ms <dig> disproportionately carries genes related to several processes which may be important for its expec lifestyle, including  genes related to biological adhesion and the coordination of populations  as well as  genes directed to the outer membrane of extracellular space. in total, go annotations were recoverable for  <dig> genes. statistical significance, annotated by an asterisk on the over-represented side, was determined by fisher’s exact test .



the gene classes contained disproportionately in the ms <dig> expec-associated dna are reflective of many of traits associated with expec disease, including adhesins and secreted factors  <cit> , while the over-representation of genes related to death is indicative of the enrichment of phage/prophage within the expec-associated dna, which may have carried expec-associated traits into the genome of ms <dig>  both the number of expec-associated genes in the genome of ms <dig> and the range of functional classes that these genes fall into suggests expec pathogenesis in ms <dig> is unlikely to be conferred by a narrow subset of genes, but is more likely to be a complex trait resulting from the incremental contribution of a number of interlinked processes.

ms <dig> acquired much of the expec-associated dna via horizontal transfer
several of the expec-associated features in the genome of ms <dig>  including the plasmid and the yersiniabactin iron uptake system are well characterised mobile genetic elements  <cit> , suggesting that some of the expec-associated dna present in the ms <dig> genome may be a result of recent horizontal transfer. to investigate this, we reasoned that by profiling the expec-associated regions in the ms <dig> genome for their presence or absence in the sequences of its closest relatives , we could identify the regions which have been acquired over the evolution of this strain. our broad phylogenetic estimate  suggested that  <dig> genome sequences present in ncbi were highly similar to ms <dig>  these relationships were confirmed by examining snps in the core genome of these sequences using panseq  <cit>  .

these data supported the validity of our phylogenetic estimate, as the topology of the tree shown in additional file  <dig> was very similar to the local topology around ms <dig> in the tree within figure  <dig>  using these genome sequences as close relatives of ms <dig> we identified regions of the ms <dig> chromosome or plasmid which were absent in each of these close relatives. we then combined this data with the information on the expec-associated dna in ms <dig> to visualise four categories, as shown in figure  <dig> :  regions of the backbone ms <dig> genome which are found in a relative ,  regions of the backbone genome which are not found in a relative ,  expec-associated regions which are found in a relative , and  expec-associated regions which are not found in a relative . this analysis revealed several hotspots in the ms <dig> genome which varied in the other genomes, within which the expec-associated dna appears concentrated. for example, ms <dig> shares approximately 91% of its total genome with the etec strain e24377a, however the 9% that is not found in the e24377a genome accounts for over 55% of the expec-associated dna present in the ms <dig> genome. it also appears that more immediate relatives of ms <dig>  tend to encode more of the expec-associated dna in common with ms <dig> than more distant relatives . to investigate this further, we calculated the proportion of expec-associated dna in the ms <dig> genome which is present in the genomes of these relatives . this analysis revealed a clear trend for more closely related isolates to ms <dig> to share more of the expec-associated dna with this isolate than less closely related ones, consistent with the hypothesis that ms <dig> has acquired the expec-associated dna over the course of its recent evolution and since divergence from e24377a.figure  <dig> 
diagrammatic representation of the similarity between the ms <dig> genome and its close relatives in reference to the expec-associated dna found within its genome. we compared the ms <dig> genome sequence to its close relatives to investigate the structure and variation in the expec-associated regions in the ms <dig> genome . regions of the non-expec associated dna in the ms <dig> genome which are also found in the isolate are coloured white, regions of this dna which are not found in the isolate are coloured yellow. expec-associated dna which is found in the isolate are coloured grey, and expec-associated dna which is not found in the isolate are red. several regions of clear variation between the ms <dig> genome and the related isolates are evident , within which the expec-associated dna appears to be concentrated. we then investigated the proportion of the ms <dig> expec-associated dna which could be found in the genomes of these relatives , which showed that closer phylogenetic relatives of ms <dig> tend to encode more of the expec-associated dna in common with ms <dig> than do other, more distantly related isolates. the dendrograms presented alongside each panel are linear representations of the phylogeny in additional file 7: figure s <dig> with bootstrap values removed.



to build a model of the stages in the acquisition of the expec-associated dna by ms <dig>  we investigated the distribution of the expec-associated genes in the genomes of the close relatives, and performed clustering based on the distribution of genes between the different genomes. this clustering, shown on the row dendrogram in figure  <dig>  is compared against the phylogenetic relatedness between the isolates, shown on the column dendrogram, which is taken from the phylogenetic analysis shown in additional file  <dig> 

this analysis supports the hypothesis that a large proportion of the expec-associated genes within the ms <dig> genome have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer during its recent evolutionary history. the horizontal clustering in figure  <dig> suggests three distinct groups:  genes which appear ancestral to the linage leading to ms <dig>  as they are found in the majority of this set of genomes ,  chromosomally encoded expec genes, some of which are found in e24377a, but most are found only in  <dig> of the closest relatives of ms <dig> and  a group of mainly plasmid encoded genes which are found only in three of the most phylogenetically proximal isolates to ms <dig>  comparison with the phylogenetic relatedness  suggests that these expec genes have been acquired in successive stages, with two transference events leading to the combination of chromosomal genes, and a subsequent acquisition of the plasmid. interestingly, this analysis also suggests this plasmid to be instable, with subsets of the plasmid encoded genes missing in strains h <dig>  h <dig> and str. o <dig> . furthermore, this model suggests the plasmid may have been subsequently lost by the lineage leading to ms 182– <dig>  hvh_ <dig>  hvh_ <dig> figure  <dig> 
clustering of the distribution of expec-associated genes in close relatives of ms <dig>  the distribution of expec-associated genes from ms <dig> are clustered according to the row dendrogram. three broad groups of genes can be resolved from this analysis:  chromosomal genes which appear to be ancestral to the ms <dig> lineage,  chromosomal genes which are present in a subset of  <dig> genomes in the group, including ms <dig> and its six closest relatives, and,  plasmid genes present in ms <dig> and its three most proximal phylogenetic relatives. the column dendrogram has been ordered according to the phylogenetic relatedness between the strains as show in additional file  <dig>  from these relationships, a model can be proposed where the ms <dig> acquired some chromosomally encoded expec genes in two stages, with the acquisition of the plasmid occurring subsequently . this model suggests that the plasmid has been lost in the lineage leading to ms 182– <dig> and the two hvh strains .



given that our data indicate that many of the expec-associated genes were acquired by ms <dig> via horizontal gene transfer, we performed a more detailed comparison of the relationships between the sequences of these genes in ms <dig>  and those present in other expecs, in order to trace the provenance of these genes. to do this we constructed phylogenetic trees for each of the genes within clusters  <dig> and  <dig> from figure  <dig>  and calculated the distances between the sequences found in ms <dig>  and the cognate sequences from other expecs .

as we expected, no single expec genome contained homologues to all of the expec-associated genes present in the ms <dig> genome, which is consistent with the hypothesis that ms <dig> acquired these genes in stages rather than en bloc in a single interaction with a donor source. conversely,  <dig> of the  <dig> expec-associated genes we postulate were acquired by the last common ancestor of ms <dig> and e24377a have very similar homologues in  <dig> closely related phylogroup b <dig> strains- of which the most similar is the isolate hvh  <dig>  further investigation of the hvh  <dig> genome revealed a 31 bp remnant of the missing gene , suggesting that this gene may have been previously present in this lineage, but has since become substantially truncated. therefore, it is probable that a hvh 212-like e. coli was the donor source for the complement of expec-associated genes acquired by the last common ancestor of ms <dig> and e24377a.

similarly, the expec-associated genes putatively encoded on the ms <dig> plasmid can also all be found in  <dig> other isolates - in this case  <dig> originate from phylogroup b <dig> and one from phylogroup d, whilst the most similar genes are found in the phylogroup b <dig> isolate hvh  <dig>  indeed, further analysis of these additional genomes revealed several, and in particular hvh  <dig>  to contain highly homologous sequences to the entirety of the putative ms <dig> plasmid . as expected, the average distance between the ms <dig> plasmid gene sequences and those in hvh- <dig> is much smaller  than between the chromosomal genes shared between ms <dig> and hvh  <dig> , consistent with the plasmid having been acquired much more recently by the ms <dig> lineage. although it is possible that, rather than the ms <dig> lineage acting as a recipient for the plasmid from these strains, instead ms <dig> served as the donor of this plasmid, we consider this scenario unlikely due to evidence for similar plasmids in a high number of isolates closely related to hvh  <dig> within phylogroup b <dig> 

however, the provenance of the chromosomal genes acquired by the ms <dig> lineage subsequent to its divergence from e24377a appears more nuanced, and we could not clearly demarcate putative donor strains which could have contributed all of these genes to the ms <dig> genome. some genes, such as the yersiniabactin iron uptake locus, are highly similar to those found in phylogroup d strains kte <dig>  hvh  <dig>  hvh  <dig> and hm <dig>  whilst others, for example the phosphoglyerate transport  locus, are much more similar to cognate genes found in phylogroup b <dig> strains kte <dig>  hvh  <dig> and hvh  <dig>  this suggests that at least  <dig> separate interactions have occurred which have resulted in the specific arrangement of these expec-associated genes in the ms <dig> genome, however we cannot rule out the possibility that a single donor strain existed which is not represented in the panel of sequences we used.

CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that ms <dig> and st <dig> e. coli represent an emerging extraintestinal pathogen with world-wide presence. strikingly, the isolates from this sequence type share an epidemiological profile very similar to expecs, with a low incidence of intestinal pathogenic isolates combined with a high incidence of both intestinal commensal and extra-intestinal pathogenic variants. our present work suggests this is likely to be underpinned by regions of the genome which are reminiscent of extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli in phylogroup b <dig>  d and f, which are much less likely to be found amongst other phylogroup b <dig> e. coli. these regions disproportionately encode traits, including iron acquisition systems and adhesins, which are crucial for the diseases caused by classic expecs. furthermore, our analyses indicate that over half of the total expec-associated dna within the ms <dig> lineage has been acquired since its divergence from e24377a, which our data indicate to be the closest diarrheagenic relative to the st <dig> group. this dna, including the chromosomally encoded yersiniabactin locus, kpss and the ms <dig> plasmid, appear to have been acquired in stages, suggestive of an iterative evolutionary process which has gradually recapitulated the expec phenotype in a typically non-expec background, thus allowing ms <dig>  and potentially other st <dig> isolates which share this genetic information, to colonise niches broadly unavailable to their ancestral group. these analyses help illuminate the genetic basis for extraintestinal disease, since the data reveal those factors which, when shuffled together, are sufficient to permit the emergence of a novel expec lineage.

for the farm from which ms <dig> was isolated, st <dig> was the dominant disease-associated clone present at the time of sampling  <cit> . however, this and another study have shown that metritis-associated e. coli originate from a diverse range of phylogenetic lineages, albeit with a preponderance for isolates from phylogroup b <dig>  <cit> . although these studies found few genes to be associated with metritis e. coli, bicalho and colleagues saw a modest enrichment of fimh carrying isolates in metritis  <cit> , which is concordant with the differential carriage of type i fimbriae we found between expec genomes and those from phylogroup b <dig>  however, the general failure of previous studies to identify genes associated with metritis may indicate that the causative e. coli utilise disparate virulence strategies to colonise and cause disease in the bovine uterus, yet it also may reflect the fact that the expec-associated genes we have identified in ms <dig> are often unrepresented in pcr based analyses of virulence gene carriage. we anticipate the results presented here will inform future population level analyses of e. coli associated with metritis and other atypical expecs, to investigate if these, or a subset of these genes, can define this economically important pathotype and be used as diagnostic or therapeutic targets.
