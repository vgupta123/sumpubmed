BACKGROUND
continuous tnf stimulation promotes proliferation and new blood vessel formation by huvec - the process of tnf-induced angiogenesis  <cit> , which plays a role in the pathogenesis of solid tumours, multiple myeloma  <cit>  and rheumatoid arthritis  <cit> . however, the molecular system underlying tnf-induced angiogenesis is not well understood  <cit> . better understanding of this system may lead to new biomarkers an anti-cancer drugs.

methods
we analysed a dna microarray data set  in which gene expression had been measured in huvec over eight time points of tnf stimulation  in triplicate . here, time  <dig> means the time point when exposure to tnf was started. the  <dig> time points ×  <dig> replicate data set was normalized using cyclic loess. before cluster analysis below, we removed those genes that had average expression values across all time points ≤  <dig> or missing values at any time point, leaving  <dig>  genes. the expression data for each gene was then standardised so that mean =  <dig> and variance =  <dig> 

we performed clustering using a k-means algorithm with peason's correlation coefficient as the similarity measure between genes to identify sets of genes that have similar temporal gene expression patterns in huvec following tnf stimulation. we should note that other clustering techniques with different similarity metrics could also be used. for example with this time course data we could have used a similarity metric that incorporated a time lag between the compared expression profiles, however since the dataset used contained only eight time points we used non-time lagged statistic in order to achieve as stable a result as possible.

during the k-means clustering the number of clusters was set to  <dig>  although the number of clusters chosen stongly influences the output of k-means clustering algorithms and is usually statistically optimised, clustering is not a final goal of our analysis in this case. therfore, a single relatively large value of k was chosen in order to obtain tight clusters that have closely correlated and possibly complex co-expression patters.

then, to identify biologically informative clusters, we used functional enrichment analysis by david   <cit> . the functional enrichment analysis david was performed to identify genes in the same cluster enriched for particular biological functions. after finding biologically informative clusters, we needed to elucidate the putative directional relationships between the genes in these clusters. for this purpose, we estimated a probabilistic network of relationships between these genes using a bayesian network estimation program, sign-bn  <cit> , implemented on the supercomputer system at human genome center, the institute of medical science, the university of tokyo  <cit> . the estimated gene network was analyzed using cell illustrator  <cit> , a gene network analysis platform.

RESULTS
clustering and functional enrichment of clusters
we performed k-means clustering with k =  <dig> and evaluated the functional enrichment of genes in each cluster using david. of the  <dig> clusters, we found that three had significant enrichment of cell proliferation, apoptosis and angiogenesis annotations. the results of functional enrichment analysis using david are summarized in table  <dig>  these three clusters included a total of  <dig> genes. the profiles of these genes in tnf-stimulated huvec were used to estimated a baayesian gene regulatory network.

functional enrichment for each cluster was evaluated by using david. the following three clusters have enrichment of cell proliferation, apoptosis and angiogenesis that are important function for interpreting the estimated tnf-induced gene networks.

gene network analysis for tnf-regulated genes
dynamic bayesian networks were estimated using the computer program sign-bn , in which membership of the three clusters is distinguished by color. for more detail, the network file is also available . the size of each node is propotional to the number of its direct child genes, i.e., out-degree. therefore, the genes shown as large nodes potentially function as hubs that are the candidate master regulators. among the three clusters, angiogenesis genes are enriched in the cluster c. the expression levels of genes in the cluster c are induced in early time points, with the average expression profile of genes in this cluster show the peak at  <dig>  hours after tnf treatment was initiated and then decreased monotonically. interestingly, interleukin- <dig>  is included in the cluster c. il <dig> transduces proliferation-promoting signals and many proliferation-related genes are induced  <cit> . therefore, we next focused on the sub-network related to il <dig> 

we have previously noted that especially important gene network hubs may have their direct chilren enriched for specific functional annotations  <cit> , therefore we looked at the functional annotations of il <dig> children. in the estimated network, il <dig> has  <dig> direct child genes, including ten genes related to the gene ontology  path for cellular proliferation  and  <dig> genes known to be nf-kb targets, with transfac promoter motif v$nfkb_q6_ <dig> .

nf-κb is a master transcription factor, which induces genes that control cell proliferation, cell survival, and immune response  <cit> . although no genes encoding nf-κb family proteins are direct children of il <dig>  we have previously suggested that the nf-κb family do not appear in gene networks  <cit> , since the activity of this family are regulated largely by post-transcriptional mechanisms. however, il <dig> may not work alone in regulating nf-κb transcriptional activity. its activity may be complimented by tnf-induced molecular pathways that converge on nf-κb from several directions, since  <dig> other hubs in the gene network also have ≥ <dig> direct children that are known in the transfac database to have nf-κb response elements in their promoters . interestingly, interleukin- <dig>  is also a direct child gene of il <dig> in the gene network. il <dig> induces angiogenesis by strongly promoting huvec growth  <cit> . two direct children of il <dig> are also key to nf-κb family activity - rela is an nf-κb family member and nfkbie is a direct upstream regulator of nf-κb proteins. based on these facts, we propose the hypothesis that il <dig>  along with cascade of other molecules, works as an initiator of tnf-induced angiogenesis to promote excess huvec growth by inducing nf-κb and il <dig>  the sub-network related to il <dig> and il <dig> is shown in figure  <dig> 

as for the estimated relationship between il <dig> and il <dig>  it is known that il <dig>  tnf and il <dig> combinatorially induce nf-κb and nf-il <dig> , which in turn induce il <dig>  <cit> . therefore, under tnf stimulus, our estimated edge from il <dig> to il <dig> is biologically tenable based on published experimental results.

the network also suggests a relationship of il <dig> and il <dig> to apoptosis. nfκb <dig>  cflar, bcl2a <dig> stat5a and traf <dig> are anti-apoptotic factors and are estimated to induce il <dig>  i.e., they are direct network parents of il <dig>  on the other hand, il <dig> is known to inhibit endothelial cell apoptosis  <cit> . in the gene network, five genes  of the  <dig> genes that are direct children of il <dig> are annotated with an anti-apoptotic function . therfore, the network suggests a complex tnf-indiced apoptosis-regulating pathway focussed around il <dig> and il <dig> 

in addition, in the il6-il <dig> sub-network, il <dig> and il <dig> have eight and ten children, related to cellular proliferation . the tnf-induced pathways proposed by this network analysis that lie downstream of il <dig> and il <dig> may synergise to promote tnf-angiogenesis, since it is known that the processes of proliferation and apoptosis are both required for angiogenesis  <cit> .

discussion
our computational gene network suggetsed that tnf-induced angiogenesis may be promoted by modulating both apoptosis and proliferation via il6-il <dig> sub-networks initiated by tnf. il <dig> is a major angiogenesis factor, but the mechanism of il <dig> induction is not fully understood  <cit> . our anlalysis suggests that the roles played by il <dig> and il <dig> in regulating nf-kb activity, apoptosis and cellular proliferation during tnf-induced angiogenesis should receive further experimental study. this is cliniclaly relevant since the tnf-induced angiogenesis inhibitor thalidomide is used for treatment of cancers  <cit> , and since the tnf-induced activation of nf-κb transcripional programs that occurs in breast cancer and cultured endothelial cells appear very similar  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
tnf-induced angiogenesis is an important factor in cancer and rheumatic disease  <cit> . computational gene network analysis proposed new biologically tenable molecular pathways of tnf-induced angiogenesis. in particular, based on the information of the tnf-induced estimated gene network, il <dig> induced nf-κb  <cit>  and il <dig>  <cit>  appear to play an especially strong role in this process. this study suggests that the analysis of drug response time course gene expression data using gene network methods, along with functional annotation of the gene networks, has the potential to retrieve information about complex molecular systems, and that this method can be used to generatre hypotheses for testing in the laboratory.
