BACKGROUND
flax or linseed  is one of the earliest domesticated crops. it is a self-pollinating diploid species cultivated as a source of fibre, oil and medicinal compounds. historically it has been used as a model for developmental studies and has a different evolutionary history than other model plants like arabidopsis  <cit> . among plant foods, flaxseed has the highest contents of the essential omega- <dig> fatty acid, alpha-linolenic acid   <cit>  and bioactive phenolic compounds such as lignans, predominantly secoisolariciresinol diglucoside   <cit> , phenolic acids and flavonoids  <cit> . ala dampens inflammatory reactions, thereby reducing a risk of heart attack or stroke; while lignans are strong antioxidants inhibiting breast and prostate cancers. given the economic and health benefits of these bioactive compounds, it would be useful to comprehensively analyze the genes involved in their biosynthesis. in plants, glycosylation represents the last step in the biosynthesis of numerous natural compounds like terpenes, phenylpropanoids, cyanogenic glucosides and glucosinolates. it is an important modification that alters their activity, sub-cellular location and modulates their chemical properties, such as solubility and stability, which are important for their in planta functions  <cit> .

the glycosylation process is catalyzed by glycosyltransferase enzymes , which are highly divergent, polyphyletic and belong to a multigene family found in all living organisms  <cit> . gts from diverse species have been classified into  <dig> families based on the amino acid sequence similarities, catalytic mechanisms and the presence of conserved sequence motifs . among these, the glycosyltransferase family  <dig> is the largest family, the enzymes of which generally catalyze transfer of the glycosyl group from nucleoside diphosphate-activated sugars  to a diverse array of substrates, including hormones, secondary metabolites and xenobiotics such as pesticides and herbicides  <cit> . the plant ugt enzymes are characterized by a unique, well-conserved sequence of  <dig> amino acid residues designated as the plant secondary product glycosyltransferases  box  <cit>  and a catalytic mechanism that inverts the anomeric configuration of a transferred sugar  <cit> .

the gt family  <dig> has been extensively studied in various plants species, as well as in humans. in mammals, ugts coordinate the activity of signal molecules such as steroid hormones and detoxify xenobiotic compounds taken up from the environment  <cit> . polymorphisms among these ugts have been shown to be associated with increased susceptibility to certain diseases in humans  <cit> . studies in model plants have shown that the plant genomes contain a great diversity of gene sequences predicted to be involved in glycosylation  <cit> . the occurrence of a wide range of glycosylated products in flax  <cit>  suggests the presence of a large number of ugts. the availability of the flax genome sequence , tissue specific ests  and microarray expression dataset  <cit>   of flax provide an opportunity to analyze the diversity of expressed glycosyltransferase family genes in this economically important oilseed crop.

in this study, we identified  <dig> ugt genes from flax, which were clustered into  <dig> phylogenetically distinct groups. their expression patterns were analyzed using  <dig> tissue specific est libraries available at the ncbi as well as the publicly available microarray expression data, which indicated their differential expression in various flax tissues. this digital expression analysis was further supported by rt-qpcr for ten selected genes. seven flax diverged ugts were identified from the families  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  which indicated diversification of flax ugts as compared to those of four other sequenced dicots, viz., ricinus communis, populus trichocarpa, vitis vinifera and arabidopsis thaliana.

RESULTS
identification of flax ugt genes
blastp search against the  <dig>  flax gene models  using the conserved pspg box sequence resulted in the identification of  <dig> scaffolds. family  <dig> ugts usually utilize low molecular weight compounds as acceptor substrates and udp-sugars as donors  <cit>  and commonly possess a carboxy terminal consensus sequence  believed to be involved in binding to the udp moiety of the sugar nucleotide donor  <cit> . taking these characteristics into account,  <dig> sequences  having lengths of 375– <dig> amino acids and 0– <dig> introns were selected and subjected to phylogenetic and digital expression analysis. in order to confirm the open reading frame  sequence of these genes,  <dig> genes expressed in seed tissue were randomly selected, isolated using pcr, cloned and sequenced, which revealed that they were 100% identical to the putative ugt gene sequences identified.

phylogenetic analysis
all the identified putative ugt genes were classified as per the recommendations of the ugt nomenclature committee  <cit>  . as expected, the pspg signature motif was present in all the ugt sequences and the overall sequence similarity among them varied substantially from 36% to 98% . a total of  <dig> amino acid positions  were aligned for all the genes analyzed and used to construct a phylogenetic tree. fourteen major groups  were defined by both the neighbour-joining  and parsimony methods with high bootstrap supports  . the tree topology and grouping of the ugts were similar as described for the arabidopsis ugt genes  <cit> , e.g. group l consists of the ugts belonging to the families  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  however, in four groups, a, c, g and i, sequences from additional ugt families were observed viz. luugt <dig>  luugt <dig>  luugt <dig> and luugt <dig>  respectively. the number of genes  as well as the sequence diversity varied considerably within each group .

detection of orthologs and duplicated genes
the orthologs of flax ugts identified in the four selected dicots are listed in the additional file  <dig>  of the  <dig> sequences, orthologs were identified for  <dig> ugts from at least one of the four dicots. however, for  <dig> sequences, orthologs were identified from all the four species. the maximum number of orthologs  was identified in case of vitis vinifera, while the lowest of  <dig> orthologs were detected in case of arabidopsis thaliana. seven flax diverged ugts were identified  and  <dig> gene duplication events with sequence similarity of ~90% were observed .

analysis of intron gain/loss events
among the  <dig> sequences,  <dig> were intron less, while  <dig> and  <dig> had one and two introns each, respectively . total  <dig> introns were detected in the  <dig> ugts, with an average of  <dig>  intron per gene. seven independent intron insertion events were observed when the intron positions were compared with the sequence relationship predicted by the phylogenetic analysis . an intron was considered conserved if its position in a particular sequence was within 40– <dig> amino acids of its mean recorded position across the sequences . two conserved introns  were identified, of which intron  <dig> was observed in  <dig> ugts belonging to the a, c and f-j phylogenetic groups, while intron  <dig> was observed in  <dig> ugts belonging to the d, e, k and l phylogenetic groups. luugt79a <dig> from group a and luugt709e <dig> from group g both had the conserved introns. alternatively, group m showed absence of both the conserved introns, while luugt92g <dig> from group m showed gain of intron  <dig>  within the members of groups f-j and n, intron  <dig> was predominant, except in luugt85q <dig> and luugt87j <dig>  in comparison, the members of groups k and l had intron  <dig>  while only one member of l group  showed the presence of intron  <dig>  all other introns were either found only within a single restricted group of closely related sequences or in only a single gene. group b members were intron less.

many sequences showed loss of the conserved introns and gain of other introns. for example, within group a, three members from family  <dig> and one member from family  <dig>  showed loss of conserved introns  <dig> and  <dig>  and gain of introns  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. similarly, within group d, four members of family  <dig> lost conserved intron  <dig> and few members gained introns  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  likewise, in group e, all the members of the family  <dig> showed loss of conserved intron  <dig> while gain of introns  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in few members.

most of the conserved introns were either in phase  <dig>  or phase  <dig>  . the intron sizes of flax ugts ranged from 65 bp to 2258 bp with an average of 406 bp for both the introns. about 28% of the flax ugt introns were in the size range of 65–99 bp .

in arabidopsis,  <dig> out of  <dig> ugt genes contained introns while, three genes had two introns. by comparing the intron positions with sequence relationships predicted by phylogenetic analysis, a minimum of nine independent intron insertion events appear to have happened in the course of ugt evolution in arabidopsis. intron  <dig> was found to be widespread and oldest intron and was present in all of the  <dig> ugt sequences in groups f–k in arabidopsis  <cit> . similarly in flax, the introns  <dig> and  <dig> have been found in most members of the groups f-j and k respectively and could be considered as the oldest introns.

expression analysis of flax ugt genes using est data
expression of the identified ugt genes was analyzed using the available est and microarray data of flax. of the  <dig> genes,  <dig> genes showed expression evidence based on either or both the datasets. among these,  <dig> genes  were expressed based on the est data; while the microarray data indicated expression evidence for  <dig> genes  . similarly for  <dig> genes, the expression evidence was present in both the datasets. further, the ests from various flax tissues were mapped onto the  <dig> flax ugt gene models to estimate their gene expression levels. this analysis identified that a total of  <dig> ests mapped to  <dig> flax ugt sequences with an average of  <dig>  ests per gene. the frequency of ests varied greatly from  <dig> to  <dig> per ugt gene model. among the various tissue types, flower  and seed coat at torpedo stage  had the largest number of highly expressed genes, while globular embryo  stage had the lowest  number of expressed genes.

the highest number of ests  were mapped to  <dig> sequences of group g, followed by  <dig> ests mapping to  <dig> members of group e. on the contrary, only one est was mapped to a single group n member. on an average, the highest of  <dig>  ests were mapped per ugt sequence of family g, followed by  <dig>  ests per gene of family e. the percentage of the genes expressed per phylogenetic group or family varied from 28% to 100% . among all the genes expressed, luugt85q <dig> and luugt74s <dig> showed the highest expression in flower  and seed coat at torpedo stage , respectively .

expression analysis of flax ugt genes using microarray data
in addition to the sequence based expression analysis method, we also used publicly available microarray data  under the platform gse <dig>  which profiles expression patterns for various flax tissues and seed developmental stages, viz., roots , leaves , stem outer tissues: vegetative stage , stem outer tissues: green capsule stage , stem inner tissues: vegetative stage , stem inner tissues: green capsule stage , seeds: 10–15 days after flowering  , seeds: 20– <dig> daf  and seeds: 40– <dig> daf   <cit> . we used the robust multichip average  -normalized, averaged gene-level log <dig> values for expression evidence of ugts to construct a heat map . hierarchical clustering with pearson correlation matrix highlighted co-expression of specific gene family members in specific tissue types. only  <dig> of the  <dig>  flax ugts represented on the array showed expression evidence . three genes were highly expressed in seed stages s <dig> and s <dig> , luugt709e <dig> , and luugt709e <dig> , respectively; while one gene  showed the highest expression in leaf tissue . the number of genes having higher expression in different tissues  varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . among the different tissues, sogc had the largest number of highly expressed genes, while s <dig> had the lowest  . surprisingly, the two contrasting varieties, drakkar and belinka did not show any difference in the expression of these  <dig> ugts .

expression profiling using rt-qpcr
the rt-qpcr is currently the most accurate method for detecting differential gene expression. the  <dig> tissue types selected for ugt expression profiling cover all plant parts and seed developmental stages from fertilization to seed maturation. eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5a  was selected as a reference gene after confirming the stability of this gene across all the tissue types used in the study  <cit> . single dissociation curves were observed for all the flax ugt genes and etif5a, confirming amplification specificity of the primers. the Δct method  <cit>  was used to express the results relative to the reference gene. a validation experiment was conducted to ensure similar amplification efficiencies of all the genes analyzed.

relative transcript abundance of  <dig> flax ugt genes was profiled and is graphically represented in figure  <dig>  all the selected genes had est expression evidence and covered six phylogenetic groups. the luugt71m <dig> transcript was detected in mature leaves, stem, etiolated seedling and  <dig> daf; however, the relative expression level compared to other ugt genes was very low. luugt94g <dig> expressed constitutively in almost all tissues types; specifically it showed maximum expression in stem. its expression was also supported by ests from stem peel library. luugt72n <dig> expressed in flower,  <dig> and  <dig> daf with peak at  <dig> daf. luugt85q <dig> had  <dig> ests mapped from flower est library and rt-qpcr analysis confirmed its high expression in flower. expression of luugt89b <dig> was observed in later stages of seed development viz.  <dig> and  <dig> daf and supported by two est clones identified in torpedo seed coat stage. luugt72m <dig> expressed in mature leaves, flowers and early seed developmental stages whereas luugt72r <dig> and luugt712b <dig> were highly expressed in various seed developmental stages. luugt85q <dig> belonged to family  <dig> which is known to be involved in glycosylation of cyanogenic compounds  <cit> . the abundance of cyanogenic compounds and higher expression of luugt85q <dig> in stem, root and mature seed  suggest the putative function as cyanogenic glycosyltransferases  <cit> . luugt74s <dig> expressed highly in developmental seed stages and peaked at  <dig> daf i.e. torpedo stage of embryo. flax has a major lignan, secoisolariciresinol diglucoside, which is a phenylpropanoid and accumulates in seed coat  <cit> . ugts belonging to the gene family  <dig> glycosylate phenylpropanoid group of compounds. about  <dig> ests clones from torpedo stage seed coat library were mapped on luugt74s <dig> gene indicating its putative in planta function as secoisolariciresinol glycosyltransferase. expression profiles of the  <dig> selected genes analyzed using rt-qpcr, matched well with the digital expression results.

discussion
glycosylation mediated by glycosyltransferase enzymes  is a critical step in metabolic pathways with diverse roles in cellular processes and homeostasis  <cit> . recent studies involving functional characterization of plant gts suggest their important roles in growth, development and interaction with the environment  <cit> . the activities of many gts from a variety of plants and biological roles of their products have been known for a long time  <cit> . however, the methods for identification of ugts based on biochemical and classical genetic approaches are slow and difficult  <cit> . recent developments in plant genomics stimulated the use of strategies such as differential display methods and/or homology-based screening of cdna libraries for identification and isolation of novel ugt genes  <cit> , although the roles of many ugts still remain uncertain. availability of whole genome sequence of many plants enabled a thorough and detailed analysis of multigene families. for example, in arabidopsis, genome-wide search using pspg motif identified  <dig> putative ugt genes. similarly, a whole genome survey of six plant species resulted in identification of  <dig>  to  <dig>  ugts  <cit> .

the recently published draft genome sequence and the extensive tissue specific est library collections of flax provided an opportunity to investigate the diversity in flax ugt multigene family in a greater detail. we identified  <dig> flax ugts, which is more than that identified in arabidopsis but less than that discovered in rice, grapevine and medicago  <cit> . all the identified ugts contain two major domains, a conserved c-terminal domain and a variable n-terminal domain, although the overall sequence diversity was high among the genes.

flax ugt family resembles the phylogenetic group structure of arabidopsis ugts
a phylogenetic tree provides a framework to compare the properties of gene family members and to identify similarities and differences among them  <cit> . in the present study, the flax genome revealed  <dig> ugt families including four new families , not reported in arabidopsis. however, phylogenetic analysis of flax ugts clustered them in  <dig> groups  as reported in arabidopsis  <cit>  and interestingly, the four new flax ugt families did not form any additional groups. moreover, all the six sequences of the ugt <dig> family clustered with the sesamum indicum ugt94d <dig> sequence , and ugt94b <dig>  are the only ugt <dig> family sequence reported till now. a phylogenetic tree constructed by bowles et al. <cit>  using  <dig> ugt sequences reported from other plant species along with the arabidopsis ugt sequences, mostly resulted in  <dig> groups, while an additional group of cytokinin gts was identified containing the phaseolus vulgaris and zea mays ugt sequences  <cit> . based on the phylogenetic analysis of arabidopsis ugts, it has been shown that it might be possible to correlate, to a large extent, the regiospecificity of glycosylation to the phylogenetic groups  <cit> . the exception to this might be due to regioswitching events taking place during evolution. in some cases, phylogenetically closely related ugts show distinct regiospecific differences towards a common acceptor. for example, a. thaliana ugts, atugt74f <dig> and atugt74f <dig>  share ~82% amino acid sequence identity, and while atugt74f <dig> glucosylates the phenolic hydroxyl group of 2-hydroxy benzoic acid, atugt74f <dig> glucosylates both the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups of 2-hydroxy benzoic acid  <cit> . on the contrary, in some cases , the genes have been shown to exhibit a broad specificity toward acceptors in vitro; however, a member of this group  in sorghum bicolor specifically catalyzes the conversion of p-hydroxymandelonitrile into dhurrin in vivo <cit> . this analysis, along with amino acid sequence similarity of ugt families within a group, might be useful for predicting substrates  <cit> . for example, osmani et al. <cit>  reported that the group g members glycosylate terpenoids; while the members of groups d, e and l glycosylate flavaonoids, tepenoids and benzoates.

however, a study of several medicago truncatula ugts highlighted the difficulties in assigning substrate specificity based on phylogeny. biochemical and phylogenetic studies of mtugt78g <dig> and mtugt85h <dig> showed that substrate specificity could not be predicted by their clustering with biochemically characterized ugts belonging to the same family  <cit> . although, few genomes such as rice, poplar, grapevine and medicago have been screened and annotated for gt genes, they have not been assigned to gt groups and families so far. apart from the model plant arabidopsis  <cit> , this is the first attempt to classify gt genes into groups and families from a crop plant flax, as per the standardized system recommended by the ugt nomenclature committee  <cit> . thus, the present analysis of flax ugt genes might help to narrow down the substrate choice of a specific gene.

detection of orthologs and functional divergence of unique flax ugts
detection of orthologs is critically important for accurate functional annotation and has been widely used to facilitate the studies on comparative and evolutionary genomics  <cit> . several methods such as the blastp  <cit> , inparanoid  <cit>  and reciprocal smallest distance  <cit>  have been reported to detect orthologs. in the present study, we used blastp to identify the orthologs for flax ugts from four sequenced dicots . of the  <dig> flax ugts,  <dig> ugts had orthologs from the four dicots and seven flax-diverged ugts were detected. based on the microarray and est data,  <dig> of these  <dig> orthologs  showed expression evidence; while, five of the seven flax diverged ugts revealed expression evidence, suggesting their functional divergence. thus, the flax diverged ugts, with significantly different primary sequences than those of other surveyed dicots, might have evolved independently since the last common ancestor between flax and these dicots. as the number of flax diverged ugts identified in our analysis is small, other methods such as inparanoid search need to be conducted to identify more flax diverged ugts that the present analysis might have missed. however, we could not perform this analysis, as the flax scaffold sequences are not yet publicly available for conducting the inparanoid search.

intron mapping to understand the evolution of ugt family
to understand the evolution of a gene family within phylogenetic groups, introns, more specifically their position, phase, loss and gain, can serve as an important tool  <cit> . therefore, we conducted intron mapping in the  <dig> flax ugts among which  <dig> % sequences were intron less. this percentage is less than that observed in arabidopsis, wherein >50% genes were intron less  <cit> . in flax ugts, a total of seven intron positions were identified with the number of introns per family in the range of one to four. most families showed the presence of conserved introns  <dig>  and  <dig> , which could probably be considered as the oldest among the seven introns identified. intron  <dig> was present in almost all members of the groups f-j and n; while intron  <dig> was dominant in groups l and k. interestingly, in these groups wherever intron  <dig> was present, intron  <dig> was absent and vice versa except in case of luugt709e <dig>  where both the introns were present; while in case of luugt87j <dig>  both were absent. in other groups, the introns  <dig> and  <dig> were absent in some members of groups a, d, m and e. this suggests that either of these introns was gained prior to diversification of flax ugts. this is also supported by the observation that most of the conserved introns were in the same phase.

it is a commonly held view that the majority of conserved introns are ancient elements and their phases usually remain unchanged  <cit> . in fact, it has been further suggested that the intron sliding or shifts of intron-exon boundary over a few nucleotides causing change of intron phase are rare events and introns retain their phase for a long evolutionary time  <cit> . furthermore, the introns other than the conserved introns were found only within a single restricted group of closely related sequences or in only a single gene, suggesting a general pattern of intron gain during evolution of the flax ugt gene family. a clear case of loss of a conserved intron and gain of intron  <dig> was seen in the subfamily of closely related genes luugtb17luugtb <dig> from group a. similarly, in case of luugt73b <dig> and luugt73b <dig>  loss of conserved introns and gain of intron  <dig> was also observed. thus, analysis of the evolution of the flax ugt multigene family provides evidence for both intron gain and loss and thereby strongly supports the “intron-late” theory of intron evolution  <cit> .

expressed flax ugts: identified by digital expression analysis and supported by rt-qpcr
functional divergence among duplicated genes is one of the most important sources of evolutionary innovation in complex organisms. interestingly, among the  <dig> duplicated genes, five pairs of genes luugt94g <dig> and luugt94g4luugt73b <dig> and luugt73b13luugt712b <dig> and luugt712b5luugt86a <dig> and luugt86a <dig> and luugt74s <dig> and luugt74s <dig>  showed evidence of differential expression. for example, luugt74s <dig> showed seed coat specific expression, while its duplicated counterpart, luugt74s <dig>  remained unexpressed. evidence for differential expression was also provided by the duplicated gene pair luugt86a <dig> and luugt86a <dig>  this suggests that after duplication, the genes acquired either differential or tissue specific expression patterns. in an earlier study, haberer et al. <cit>  estimated that about two thirds of duplicate gene pairs had divergent expression in arabidopsis.

to predict and understand the roles of these ugt genes in various tissue types, gene expression pattern analysis is very helpful to infer which gene family members are expected to perform distinct or similar roles. with this aim, we performed expression analysis of flax ugts using est libraries, microarray data and rt-qpcr. about 62% flax ugts showed expression evidence based on the est data and one or more ests were detected per tissue type, providing strong evidence that most of the flax ugt genes were expressed in varied tissue types. the expression patterns analysed using rt-qpcr very well correlated with the digital expression analysis.

the frequency of ests per ugt gene ranged from 1– <dig> among the ugts, suggesting varied expression levels. among the different tissue types, seed and stem tissues showed the highest number of expressed ugts. it is known that flax seeds and stem contain a large number of secondary metabolites and hence could explain the abundance of ugts in these tissues  <cit> . however, this could also be due to a large number of est libraries available for these tissue types . this study also identified two genes, luugt85q <dig> and luugt74s <dig>  belonging to groups g and l respectively, which showed high expression in flower and seed coat from the torpedo stage. the members of these groups are predicted to glycosylate terpenoids, flavanoids and benzoates classes  <cit> ; and hence, they can be considered as potential targets for screening against these predicted classes to identify their substrates.

compared to the sequence based expression analysis method, microarray provides a high-throughput tool for simultaneous analysis of expression at the whole transcriptome level. as per the microarray data, 44% flax ugts showed expression evidence in various tissue types . three genes from seed stage and one gene from leaf showed high expression, suggesting possible involvement of these genes in seed and leaf secondary metabolite glycosylation. microarray data from two contrasting flax varieties, drakkar and belinka were also analyzed. drakkar produces better quality fibres than belinka, and is more resistant to the fungal pathogen fusarium <cit> . however, we could not detect any ugt having variety specific expression pattern. although, plant ugts have been reported to be involved in defence mechanism  <cit> , the available microarray data were not generated by exposing the varieties to any pathogen. the difference in expression of the ugts between the est and microarray datasets might have resulted from the differences in the number of tissue types, size of each dataset and varieties used for data generation. the est dataset was larger compared to the microarray dataset, therefore we might have obtained expression evidence for more genes using the est dataset. moreover, the long sequence reads of ests provide fairly unambiguous evidence of gene expression, compared with the hybridization based microarray data and hence est profiling could be considered as a more reliable method for transcriptomic analysis as also suggested by geisler-lee et al.  <cit>  and moreau et al. <cit> .

regarding the  <dig> unexpressed flax ugts, it is possible that some or most of these genes may express at very low levels in particular tissue type or express only under specific conditions such as biotic or abiotic stresses. hence, they might have not been represented in the est and microarray data as the data were generated from unchallenged libraries. even in the large arabidopsis est collection gathered over several years, only  <dig> % of the genes had corresponding ests  <cit> . absence of an est for a corresponding gene implies that it is either inactive or expressed at undetectable level in the tissues sampled or that it is a non-functional gene per se.

CONCLUSIONS
we identified a large number of ugt genes in the linum usitatissimum genome. these genes were clustered into  <dig> distinct evolutionary groups based on the phylogenetic analysis. two new ugt family members not observed in arabidopsis were identified in the flax genome. most of the identified genes were expressed in various tissue types and seven of them were flax diverged. results of the digital expression analysis were confirmed by rt-qpcr. two conserved introns were observed, indicating evolution of flax ugts from two lineages. the phylogenetic tree can be useful for understanding the structure-function relatedness of the ugt family members and might further facilitate their functional analysis.
