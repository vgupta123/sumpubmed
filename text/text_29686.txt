BACKGROUND
the use of plants for the large-scale production of heterologous proteins is gradually gaining widespread acceptance and could provide a platform for the cost-effective production of proteins on an agricultural scale. in particular, it has been proposed that plant production for human and animal vaccines may significantly lower the cost of production of the raw material, especially for oral vaccination  <cit> . however, low protein yield is a significant problem limiting the commercial exploitation and the competition with other heterologous production methods  <cit> . in this sense, several approaches have been developed to increase protein expression in plants. in particular, techniques such as codon optimization and subcellular targeting can markedly improve the expression levels  <cit> .

toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite capable of infecting a variety of mammals, including humans, and birds  <cit> . in humans, toxoplasmosis is usually asymptomatic in healthy individuals. however, in pregnant women, congenital infection can cause severe neonatal malformations and ocular complications in the fetus; and in immunocompromised individuals, such as aids patients and transplant recipients, often results in fatal encephalitis  <cit> . toxoplasmosis is also of veterinary importance, especially in sheep and pigs, where it often results in abortion, causing considerable economic losses  <cit> . in addition, the tissue cysts of t. gondii in meat of infected livestock are an important source of infection for humans  <cit> .

although a vaccine against human infection with t. gondii is not yet available, an effective vaccine preventing infection in animals used for human consumption would block the main transmission route to humans  <cit> . also, in the farming industry, a vaccine against t. gondii may be valuable to prevent both fetal infection and reactivation.

recently, we transiently expressed the surface antigen  <dig>  and granule dense  <dig>  of toxoplasma gondii in tobacco leaves  <cit> . sag <dig> protein is the best characterized and the primary vaccine candidate  <cit> . numerous studies have demonstrated its vaccine potentialities as a recombinant protein or as a dna vaccine  <cit> . in fact, a sag1-specific cd8+ t-cell clone exhibited cytolytic activity against target cells infected with t. gondii  <cit> . in an effort to improve the expression level of sag <dig> in plant leaves, in the present work, we investigated the effects that codon optimization and plant cell-compartment targeting have on sag <dig> expression levels using vacuum agroinfiltration. we also evaluated the efficacy of subcutaneous or oral immunization with sag1-expressing leaf extract.

RESULTS
synthesis of a codon-optimized sag <dig> gene
sag <dig>  previously named p <dig> , is the main surface antigen of t. gondii  <cit> . in the parasite, sag <dig> is processed before it is loaded to the plasma membrane, losing the signal peptide and the c-terminal hydrophobic region, to generate the mature sag177- <dig> version  <cit> . for this reason, the open reading frame sequence encoding the native sag177- <dig>  was used as a source of codon optimization for expression in tobacco . a total of  <dig> codons were altered in the ns sequence to match the codon usage preferences of nicotiana tabaccum, yielding an optimized-plant version of the sag <dig> sequence named os . the os gene was synthesized using a set of overlapping oligonucleotides . the optimization strategy removed only about 20% of all the infrequently used codons. in addition, in order to avoid potential negative factors influencing protein expression, a putative splicing site, a potential plant polyadenylation signal sequence, consecutive strings of a + t or g + c nucleotides of  <dig> bp or more were removed . the final g + c content of the os gene was lowered to 46% and the codon adaptation index value  was increased to  <dig>  for matching with tobacco genes as compared to the  <dig>  cai value of the ns sequence. the nucleotide sequence of the os gene  was 92% homologous to the ns gene. however, the amino acid sequence encoded by the os was identical to that of the ns gene to ensure retention of the antigenicity of the expressed protein.

construction of the apoplast and endoplasmic reticulum targeting vectors
the os and ns sequences were cloned in a pzp200bar binary vector for plant expression . both the os and ns sequences were fused to the tobacco  ap <dig> osmotin signal peptide sequence at the n-terminus end to target the recombinant proteins to the apoplast, generating the aos and ans sequences . combining the apoplast targeting sequence with an endoplasmic reticulum retention signal  incorporated at the c-terminus end the recombinant proteins are sequestered in the er of plant cells .

the pzp200bar binary vector, where the aos, ans, kos and kns versions were cloned, contains the duplicate cauliflower mosaic virus 35s promoter  with the translational enhancer sequence  and the nopaline synthase  terminator to stop transcription. pzp200bar also contains the basta resistance marker , which permits the selection of transformed plants . in addition to these constructions, the previously pzpvxsag <dig> and paposag <dig> constructs  <cit> , where sag <dig> is expressed as a full-length protein lacking the signal peptide , were also used .

transient expression of sag <dig> in plants
vacuum agroinfiltration was used to compare the expression of sag <dig> constructs in plants. recombinant agrobacterium carrying these constructs and the control pzp <dig> were used to agroinfiltrate leaves of the nicotiana tabaccum cv. xanthi transgenic line x-27- <dig>  <cit> . this line expresses high levels of the tobacco etch virus  p1/hc-pro sequence. agrobacterium-mediated transient expression declines sharply as a result of post-transcriptional gene silencing . certain plant viruses encode silencing suppressors that may inhibit ptgs and are used to extend and enhance agrobacterium-mediated transient expression  <cit> . in a previous work, sag <dig> was successfully expressed in this transgenic line  <cit> .

sag <dig> protein expression was measured at  <dig> days post-infiltration by western blot from three independent agrobacterium infiltrations. in agreement with our previous work  <cit> , western blot analysis of infiltrated tobacco leaf samples demonstrated the successful expression of the  <dig> kda sag <dig> together with another specific band of about  <dig> kda . sag <dig> accumulation in tobacco leaves was estimated by western blot analysis  using the gel-pro analyzer program as described in methods. agroinflitration with the pkns vector produced the highest level of sag <dig> expression being the accumulation of the kns protein 5- and 10-fold higher than aos and kos, respectively . in fact, the kns yields were ~ <dig>  μg per gram of fresh weight , while the aos and kos vectors generated the lowest sag <dig> production: ~ <dig>  μg and ~ <dig>  μg per gram of fw, respectively . on the other hand, the pans and paposag <dig> vectors expressed intermediate sag <dig> levels . the apoplast-localized native protein levels were ~ <dig>  μg per gram of fw, near a production 50% lower than that obtained by pkns . finally, the removal of the c-terminus did not affect its accumulation, when compared with its full-length  .

in order to know whether the differences in protein expression were due to differences in mrna expression, a semi quantitative rt-pcr was performed . sag <dig> mrna expression was measured at  <dig> days post-infiltration from three independent agrobacterium infiltrations. sag <dig> transcript levels were normalized with the actin transcripts used as an internal control. to estimate the level of sag <dig> mrna accumulation, the band intensity was quantified by the gel-pro program and normalized to the band intensity of actin mrna quantified by the same program. relative mrna units from the three independent agrobacterium infiltrations were plotted in figure 3b. statistical analysis from the data of the three independent agroinfiltrations altogether showed that the level of sag <dig> mrna accumulation among the infiltrated leaves with the different constructs was similar .

immunogenicity of plant-derived sag1
as a first approach to study the immunogenicity of the plant-derived sag <dig>  c3h/hen mice were subcutaneously immunized with leaf extracts expressing kns protein crude extract combined with incomplete freund adjuvant  . mice inoculated with leaves infiltrated with the empty pzp <dig> plasmid plus ifa  were used as controls. a naïve group was also included as an additional control. to analyze the immunoprotective value, two weeks after the last immunization, mice were orally challenged with a non-lethal dose of me <dig> cysts and one month later the brain parasite burden was measured. the sag <dig> group showed a significant reduction in the brain cyst burden  compared to control and naïve groups while these two last groups presented a similar brain parasite load . in order to improve the immune protection obtained in sag <dig> immunized animals, a prime-boost immunization protocol was assayed. both the sag <dig> and control groups were boosted intradermally  with rsag <dig> expressed in e. coli plus ifa . this protocol resulted in a significant reduction of 46% in the brain cyst burden compared to the control+boost group and of 54% compared to naïve mice . no significant differences were detected between the sag <dig> and sag1+boost groups or between the control and control+boost groups.

two weeks after the immunization schedule was completed, blood samples were collected and analyzed by elisa for specific anti-sag <dig> responses. also, cellular responses were studied in vivo by a dth reaction and in vitro by the characterization of the cytokine profile secreted by splenocytes . although sag1-immunized mice showed neither a significant igg production compared to the control and naïve groups  nor a positive dth reaction , significant levels of ifn-γ were detected in supernatants of spleen cells after in vitro stimulation with rsag <dig> .

on the other hand, sag1+boost-immunized mice elicited significant th <dig> polarized humoral and cellular responses . significant levels of specific igg were detected compared to all the experimental groups, with predominant secretion of igg2a over the igg <dig> isotype . sag1+boost immunized animals also showed an antigen-specific cell-mediated immunity as measured by a positive dth reaction that resulted significantly different compared to all the other groups . upon antigen-specific in vitro stimulation, the levels of ifn-γ secretion were higher than in naïve and control mice . the inclusion of an id boost with rsag- <dig> in control animals  induced an increase in specific igg levels and dth reactivity, but in contrast to the sag1+boost group, these differences did not significantly differ from the control and naïve groups . regarding ifn-γ secretion, the control+boost group presented increased levels of this cytokine, which resulted similar to that observed in the sag <dig> and sag1+boost groups, but not significantly different from control and naïve mice .

considering that t. gondii infects the host through the gut mucosa, the feasibility of inducing immunogenicity at this site by the use of transgenic plants in oral vaccination strategies is an interesting tool. therefore, an oral immunization protocol was included in this study using c57bl/ <dig>  mice. three experimental groups were used: mice orally immunized with sag1-expressing leaf extract , mice orally immunized with pzp200-infiltrated leaf extracts , and a third group of mice orally immunized with sag1-expressing leaf extracts plus an intradermal boost with rsag <dig> expressed in e. coli . to evaluate the protection against t. gondii infection, two weeks after the vaccination schedule was completed, immunized mice were orally challenged and the number of t. gondii brain cysts was analyzed one month later. no protection was observed in sag1-vaccinated mice compared to the control and naïve groups . in contrast, the sag1+boost group presented a significant reduction in the parasite load  when compared to both the sag <dig> and control groups . the number of brain cysts in the control  or pbs+boost  groups was not different from that obtained in naïve mice. in the sag1+boost group, a significant increase in the sag1-specific iggt was observed when compared to the sag <dig> and control groups . however, we could not detect significantly increased levels in any of the igg isotypes or a dth positive response in any of the experimental groups .

discussion
our group has previously investigated the suitability of a vacuum infiltration system to express sag <dig> in tobacco leaves  <cit> . in that study we tested the performance of three different constructs. two of them were based on the pvx amplicon carrying the sag <dig> gene and the other corresponded to paposag <dig>  <cit> . although the sag <dig> accumulation levels were similar in the pvx amplicon  and paposag <dig> , the use of this amplicon in transgenic plants is more difficult due to the induction of post-transcriptional gene silencing  <cit> . for this reason, in order to improve the nuclear expression of sag <dig> in plants, in this work, other binary vectors containing codon-optimized sag <dig> genes and plant cell compartment-targeting signal sequences were investigated using transient expression in nicotiana by vacuum agroinfiltration. in addition, the new constructs deleted the dna sequence encoding the highly hydrophobic  <dig> c-terminal residues that are processed in the native sag <dig> protein  <cit> .

in general, rare codons, au-rich destabilizing sequences and putative polyadenylation and splicing signals may contribute to rapid mrna decay, thus limiting the expression of foreign genes in plants. the cai value is considered a measure of the expression levels of a given gene in different organisms. it is believed that increasing the cai of a foreign gene results in a high expression level of their proteins. however, the increase in the cai value brings about an increase in the a+t content, which could decrease mrna stability and reduce the protein expression level  <cit> . recently, sou et al.  <cit>  have shown that constructs carrying optimized sequences, where the a+t content is higher than 50%, present a protein expression level significantly lower than the native protein, although the mrna level by rt-pcr is similar in all the constructs. the human papillomavirus type  <dig>  l <dig> gene re-synthesized to reflect human codon usage expresses better than the native gene, which expresses better than a plant-optimized gene  <cit> . thus, the highest expression of human l <dig> protein is correlated with a lowest a+t content, resulting in a better transcription and rna processing. finally, in the codon-optimized pymsp4/ <dig> antigen from plasmodium, the a+t content is reduced from 67% to 53% and the at-rich regions are disrupted  <cit> . the constructs that express a reduced a+t gene version are more efficient in antigen production than native versions, supporting that the increase in a+t content may decrease mrna stability and reduce the protein expression level  <cit> . in our study, codon optimization allowed increasing the cai value and a+t content for matching with tobacco genes. in the aos and kos dna sequences, the a+t content  was higher than that in the as, ans and kns  genes and the cai value was also increased to  <dig> . although this optimization of the sag <dig> gene did not significantly modify the mrna levels, the plant-optimized sag <dig> expression was significantly lower than kns, ans and as versions. based on that, we could infer that plant codon optimization negatively affected sag <dig> expression, being the yield of optimized protein extremely low without apparently affecting the transcript accumulation. however, further studies should be carried out to shed light on this point.

according to the sag <dig> accumulation analysis by western blot, we can group the expression systems in three categories; higher expression , intermediate expression  and lower expression . these results indicate that er retention of sag <dig> is highly positive and that the low expression level of the kos version seems to be restricted to the translational step. proteolysis is more likely to occur in the apoplast rather than in the er  <cit> . thus, retention of the protein in the er can be used to minimize foreign protein degradation since the er provides a relatively protective environment with molecular chaperones and stabilizing agents, which results in an increase of protein stability and an enhanced level of protein accumulation. on the other hand, sag <dig> yield was lower in the cytoplasm using pvx amplicon than in the er using nuclear expression systems. besides, the use of pvx amplicon induces gene silencing in transgenic plants that considerably affects the transgene expression, being the heterologous protein sometimes undetectable. for this reason, to produce recombinant proteins in transgenic plants, they must be co-expressed with proteins able to suppress this mechanism. however, this co-expression makes this procedure rather difficult and little feasible. overall, our data indicate that the best choice for plant expression is the kns system.

this study also focused on improving the immunization strategy with the leaves containing the sag <dig> protein and was set up as a proof of concept that plant-produced t. gondii proteins could possibly be further developed as candidates for vaccine approaches. previously, we had demonstrated that c3h/hen mice subcutaneously vaccinated with sag <dig> expressed in tobacco leaves showed significant lower brain cyst burdens compared to the control group  <cit> . in that work only the humoral response was analyzed showing that a weak th <dig> polarized response was elicited. to further evaluate the immunogenic value of plant-produced sag <dig> antigen, in the present study we characterized the immune responses elicited by the extract from leaves infiltrated with the pkns using different immunization protocols. as in our previous study, significant partial protection was obtained in sag <dig> immunized mice compared to the controls. although we could not detect specific iggs antibodies, sag <dig> immunization elicited a th <dig> cellular response characterized by significant ifn-γ production in splenocyte supernatants. a vaccine candidate against toxoplasmosis has to primarily elicit a th <dig> humoral response and especially increase ifn-γ levels, since this cytokine is one of the main mediators in host resistance to t. gondii  <cit> . in our case, no specific-humoral response was detected and this could be due to the fact that sag <dig> protein possesses conformational b-cell epitopes  <cit> . therefore, as the sag <dig> present in the leaf extracts stimulated only a cellular immune response which do not require conformational correct antigen folding  <cit> , it could be hypothesize that this protein, although it had been dialyzed prior to immunization, could not be correctly folded. in addition, sag <dig> presented post-translational modifications as glycosylphosphatidylinositol  additions during its maturation in the parasite  <cit> . although in our case it remains to be elucidated whether this post-translational modification occurred during kns maturation, it has been previously shown that the gpi anchoring motifs does not affect the elicitation of antibody and t-cell responses against this protein  <cit> .

although our main goal in this study was to evaluate whether plant-derived sag <dig> was immunoprotective, we also included a prime-boost protocol with a recombinant sag <dig> expressed in bacteria in order to see if we could improve the immunoprotection. even though the inclusion of a boost increased the protection from 30% to 46% compared to their respective controls and naïve group, the protection observed between these two protocols was not significantly different. the protection observed in the prime-boosted mice is consistent with the significant th <dig> humoral and cellular immune responses elicited.

the fact that only with the inclusion of a boost immunization a humoral response was induced, is in agreement with the results observed by wang et al.  <cit> , who obtained specific antibodies only when plants expressed pymsp4/ <dig> antigen from plasmodium primed mice where boosted with dna. it is worth mentioning that the rsag <dig> boost immunization induced significant humoral and cellular responses capable of protecting mice against infection, only when mice were previously primed with the sag <dig> expressing leaf extracts  and not with control extracts . although similar immune responses were elicited by the control+boost and sag <dig> groups , partial protection was only observed in this last group. this protective effect could be attributed to the significant levels of ifn-γ obtained in the sag <dig> group. nevertheless, whether nk or cd8+ t cell cytotoxic activity was induced by the immunization protocols, remains to be elucidated. all these results suggest that immunization with tobacco leaves expressing sag <dig> is a reliable system to generate immunity, which could be boosted by heterologous prime-boost inoculation regimens.

given that t. gondii gains entry into the body through the intestinal mucosa, an efficient stimulation of the immune response in this specialized compartment is of great importance for developing a vaccine against this parasite  <cit> . in this sense, an important purpose of the present work was to test whether leaf-sag <dig> oral vaccination could positively influence the outcome of t. gondii infection. oral immunization with sag1-containing leaves elicited neither evident humoral and cellular immune responses nor protection. noteworthy, a protocol based on a prime with oral immunizations and a boost with rsag <dig> expressed in bacteria injected intradermally elicited an important protection  that correlated at least with an increased humoral response. it is evident that oral immunization with the plant-derived sag <dig> protein prior to the e. coli-sag <dig> intradermal boost was necessary to elicit significant protection since immunization with control plant extract prior to the boost, nor the boost alone were able to elicit a protective effect. most of the reports based on oral immunization with plant expressed antigens, elicited a detectable humoral immune response only when an exogenous adjuvant was included in the vaccine formulation and/or high doses of the antigen were used  <cit> . moreover, some works showed that even using high oral antigen doses in plant extracts with adjuvant, humoral and cellular immune responses were only observed when heterologous prime-boost inoculation regimens were implemented  <cit> . taking all these data together, our results are encouraging because a low antigen dose without adjuvant was used. future studies should consider the evaluation of a wide range of leaf tissue doses using lyophilized leaves  <cit>  and/or the maximization of the efficacy of the antigen presentation by using potent oral adjuvants  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we determined that it was feasible to produce vaccine-relevant t. gondii sag <dig> protein in plants of nicotiana spp. by means of transient expression via recombinant a. tumefaciens. we demonstrated that sequence optimization showed a not positive impact on protein yield. the er targeting improved the native sag <dig> protein expression, and it could be used in oral and subcutaneous immunization protocols. sag <dig> is one of the most vaccine-relevant t. gondii proteins, so it expression in plants could have considerable potential.
