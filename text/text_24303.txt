BACKGROUND
diarrheal infections caused by bacterial enteric pathogens including salmonella, are one of the major causes of childhood morbidity and mortality in developing countries  <cit> . salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium  is an intracellular gram-negative bacterium characterized by its ability to survive and replicate within eukaryotic host cells, particularly epithelial cells and macrophages. in humans, while salmonella enterica serovar typhi typically causes severe or sometimes lethal systemic illness called "typhoid fever", salmonella typhimurium is associated with self limiting gastroenteritis and requires treatment only in immunocompromised patients. s. typhimurium develops in mice an infection with the same pathogenesis and clinical manifestations than s. typhi in humans thus, this mouse model is useful for the study of this disease  <cit> .

the intestine harbours trillions of commensal bacteria that participate in digestive functions and help to protect the host from the aggression of several enteropathogens  <cit> . the beneficial effects of the microbiota on the host immune system have allowed the proposal to use some non pathogenic bacteria, such as probiotics in improving animal health and protection against infectious agents  <cit> . probiotics have been shown to influence both innate and adaptive immunity through direct contact with epithelial and immune cells, or by their ability to modify the composition and activity of the gut microbiota. they exert their protective effects by multiple immune and non immune mechanisms  <cit> , i.e., exerting direct antimicrobial activity against pathogens  <cit> , increasing phagocytosis  <cit> , modifying cytokine production by different cell populations  <cit>  or enhancing iga production  <cit> . one of the principal mechanisms of protection against gastroenteric infections by probiotics is via modulation of pro-inflammatory  and anti-inflammatory  cytokines, but the pathways and cells involved in this mechanisms are not clear yet  <cit> . it is a fact that not all microorganisms have the same effect on the host, and that probiotic properties are strain and host specific. in this sense, it is not possible to extrapolate the effects found with one probiotic strain to another, or its effect against a specific pathogen to other pathogen  <cit> .

l. casei crl  <dig> is a probiotic bacterium and its effects on the gut immune cells have been extensively studied. in a previous work, the effect of l. casei crl  <dig> in the prevention of s. typhimurium infection in balb/c mice was evaluated. it was demonstrated that  <dig> days of l. casei crl  <dig> administration before s. typhimurium infection decreased its severity. the continuous probiotic administration  diminished the pathogen counts in the intestine as well as its spread outside this organ. the probiotic administration decreased the neutrophil infiltration with the consequent diminution of intestinal inflammation; activated the macrophage phagocytic capacity in peyer's patches, spleen and peritoneum; and increased the number of iga cells in the lamina propria of the small intestine which was correlated with increased release of s-iga specific against the pathogen in the intestinal fluids  <cit> .

the aim of the present work was to deep into the knowledge about how the probiotic bacterium l. casei crl  <dig> exerts its protective effect against s. typhimurium infection, by assessing the impact of this probiotic strain on the cytokine profile  and in the expression of different toll-like receptors  in the inductor and effector sites of the immune response in the small intestine, in both healthy and infected animals.

RESULTS

healthy mice that received the probiotic during  <dig> days  and mice non-treated with l. casei crl <dig>  but challenged with salmonella  stimulated the production of tnfα and ifnγ by the immune cells of the peyer's patches, compared to non-treated and non-infected mice  . these cytokine producing cells increased significantly  7days post challenge in the mice fed continuously  with the probiotic strain , compared to the infection control . no significant differences with the infection control  were observed in the number of tnfα  cells isolated from mice that stopped probiotic administration after infection , while these last group showed significantly  decreased number of ifnγ  cells compared to the other two infected groups . the analysis of il- <dig> producer cells showed that  <dig> days of probiotic administration  and also salmonella challenge  increased significantly  the number of these cells compared to the untreated control . seven days after infection, both groups administered l. casei crl  <dig> decreased the number of il- <dig>  cells to values similar to c group .

cytokine producing cells were analyzed by immunocytochemistry in mononuclear cells isolated from peyer's patches of mice at  <dig> time points: the day of the infection  for the untreated control  and for mice given l. casei crl  <dig> during  <dig> days , and  <dig> days post infection for infection control , mice given probiotic  <dig> days before the infection , and mice given continuously probiotic, before and after infection . results for healthy mice obtained the same day of the infected animals were not added because there were not significant differences compared to the basal data. results are expressed as the means ± sd of the total number of positive cells per  <dig> ×  <dig> counted cells at  <dig> 000x magnification. means for each value without a common letter differ significantly .

discussion
a previous work demonstrated that l. casei crl  <dig> administration induced activation of the immune cells associated to the small intestine of mice that received the probiotic strain  <cit> . we also observed that this probiotic strain decreased the severity of s. typhimurium infection in a mouse model, showing the continuous administration, the best effect. continous probiotic administration decreased the mortality percentage  and the cfu/g of salmonella in liver, spleen and large intestine for  <dig> and  <dig> days post- infection  <cit> . in the present work, some immune mechanisms by which l. casei crl  <dig> administration exerts its protective effect against salmonella infection were analyzed, as the intestinal cytokine profile in the inductor  and effector sites  of the gut immune response. the modulation of tlrs expressions was also determined in the small intestine tissues.

previous to the infection, analyzing the mononuclear cells isolated from peyer's patches, it was observed that mice fed  <dig> days with l. casei crl  <dig> significantly increased cytokines expression and also the release of ifnγ and il- <dig> by these cells. the production of cytokines in peyer's patches was maintained without significant differences in healthy animals that received the probiotic strain  during all the experiment. these cytokines were also studied  <dig> days post infection and it was observed that mice from infection control group  and the group fed continuously with the probiotic strain maintained increased expression of both tnfα and ifnγ in the cells isolated from peyer's patches. nevertheless, the release of ifnγ from these cell cultures was significantly higher in the infection control  than in the mice given probiotic . the increases of these cytokines in peyer's patches are important because they constitute the main inductor site for mucosal immune response. in s. typhimurium infection, this site is one of the pathways that salmonella uses to invade the host, although salmonella infection can also occur through the intestinal epithelial cells along the small intestine  <cit> . therefore post infection, we also focused on the cytokine expression in cells from the lamina propria of the small intestine and the cytokines secretion into the intestinal lumen, due to this is the effector site of the gut immune response . tnfα is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that induces activation and recruitment of neutrophils involved in local inflammatory processes, and produces intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction, contributing to the entry and colonization of pathogenic bacteria usually excluded from the subepithelial mucosa  <cit> . seven days post infection, the probiotic administration  was able to maintain tnfα production in the lamina propria of the small intestine and its secretion to the intestinal fluid similar to the observed in the non infected groups . these values showed a tendency to decrease  <dig> days post challenge. in contrast, the infection control group significantly increased tnfα expression  <dig> days post challenge as well as its secretion  <dig> days post infection . the tnfα modulation by probiotic administration could be related with the lesser polymorphonuclear infiltration and inflammation degree in the lamina propria observed previously  <cit> . otherwise, the positive cells for this cytokine and its release from these cells were increased in peyer's patches when the mice received continuously the probiotic strain compared to the untreated control . these increments could be related with the high number of activated macrophages present in these sites, suggesting that tnfα is required in the inductor site to maintain the immune response against salmonella . ifnγ is implicated in the immune activation by probiotic bacteria and fermented milks. it contributes in the activation of macrophages to promote the effective killing of pathogens that can survive within them. in our model, the number of ifnγ  cells in small intestinal tissues was significantly lower in the group of mice from the infection control group  than in the group of mice given continuously l. casei crl  <dig>  which maintained the number of these positive cells similar to the lc group . as regard to the release of ifnγ to the intestinal fluid, the administration of the probiotic bacteria maintained the levels of this cytokine similar to the basal data, at difference of the s group, which showed a significant decrease of ifnγ concentration after infection . ifnγ  cells also increased in healthy mice given probiotic bacteria in both inductor and effector sites of the immune response compared to the untreated control group . this is consistent with previous reports where the administration of probiotic suspensions or fermented milks was associated with increased number of ifnγ  cells in the small intestine of mice  <cit> . recent findings revealed an inhibitory effect of ifnγ on neutrophils trafficking and pro-inflammatory th <dig> cells differentiation  <cit> . according to this observation, the increased levels of this cytokine in lc-s-lc group could be correlated with the reduced spread of salmonella and the lower inflammation of small intestinal tissues observed previously  <cit> . il- <dig> was analyzed because promotes both b cell maturation  <cit>  and pro-inflammatory activity  <cit> . it was observed that  <dig> days after salmonella challenge, the production of this cytokine in the small intestine tissues was significantly increased in the three infected groups compared with the untreated control , and  <dig> days post-challenge, only the group lc-s-lc maintained a number of il- <dig>  cells higher than both control groups . however, in the mice fed continuously with the probiotic , the il- <dig> release into the intestinal lumen remained stable  <dig> and  <dig> days post-infection. in contrast, the infection control group  significantly increased il- <dig> secretion during all the experiment, compared with basal data . these results showed that probiotic administration can down regulate the release of il- <dig> but maintain increased production of this cytokine in the intestine which could be used by the host if it is required.

according with the results obtained for the mentioned cytokines, il- <dig> was studied as an anti-inflammatory cytokine and similar to il- <dig> is required to maintain the iga  b cell population  <cit> . in our work,  <dig> days post challenge the number of il- <dig>  cells was significantly higher in infected mice that received probiotic administration than in mice from s group, . as regard to this cytokine release, the concentration of il- <dig> in the intestinal fluid was significantly decreased in the infected control group  throughout the study, while in mice from lc-s group the significant decrease was observed  <dig> days post infection. at day  <dig> post-challenge, il- <dig> release of lc-s-lc group was lower than absolute control  and lc group, but restored at day  <dig> post-challenge. these results highlight the importance of continuous probiotic administration in the modulation of the immune response .

previous results obtained in our group suggested that probiotic administration modulates the cytokine profile, mainly in the cells from the innate immune response through tlrs stimulation  <cit> . according to this, and considering the differences observed for the cytokines, we analyzed the expression of tlrs in immune and epithelial cells of the small intestine in our infection model.

tlr <dig> was studied due this receptor recognize the peptidoglycan which is the principal component of the gram+ bacteria such as lactobacillus genus. our results showed a significant increase of tlr <dig>  cells in the small intestine of healthy mice that received l. casei crl  <dig> compared to the untreated control  and significant increases were also observed, only for  <dig> days post infection, in the mice given continuously the probiotic bacteria  compared to the infection control . this result agrees with other findings describing a similar effect induced by two lactobacillus strains, l. rhamnosus gg and l. plantarum bfe  <dig>  which enhanced tlr <dig> in vitro using human intestinal cells  <cit> . we consider that the probiotic strain stimulates the tlr <dig> not only to increase the signals to produce cytokines, but also to increase the epithelial barrier because it was demonstrated tlr <dig> activation have an important role in enhancing trans-epithelial resistance to invading bacteria  <cit> . another receptor analyzed was tlr <dig>  which recognizes the lps present in the cell wall of the gram bacteria  <cit> . it is known that tlr <dig> plays a significant role in the host defences against salmonella infection in vivo  <cit> . in our model, l. casei crl  <dig> administration to healthy mice increased the number of tlr <dig>  cells compared to the untreated control, which could be used as a surveillance mechanism against pathogen bacteria such as salmonella. recent findings suggest that the activation of this receptor initiates an innate immune response leading to the induction of pro-inflammatory mediators, to increase tlr <dig> expression, and to reduce its own expression, which leads to the recruitment of inflammatory cells and the initiation of the appropriate responses in the spleen leading control of the bacterial multiplication  <cit> . this is consistent with the results obtained in our study where the enhancement of tlr <dig> was accompanied of increased number of tlr <dig>  cells previous and post infection . the early increase in the expression of tlr <dig> could be related with the decrease of the severity of the infection observed in the treated groups where the bacterial growth in the spleen and the liver decreased faster than in the infection control  <cit> .

tlr <dig> was evaluated because flagellated bacteria, including e. coli and salmonella, can interact with tlr <dig> to induce activation of pro-inflammatory gene programs for host protection  <cit> . in the present work, we observed that probiotic administration increased tlr <dig>  cells after salmonella infection in both groups that received the probiotic strain for  <dig> days post challenge compared to untreated mice . this finding agrees with other study where two lactobacilli were able to increase the cell surface expression of tlr <dig> in ht <dig> cells to respond to s. typhimurium  <cit> . in our model, this receptor could be also implicated in the protective effect of l. casei crl  <dig> against s. typhimurium infection.

finally, in our study, it was observed that l. casei crl  <dig> oral administration increased tlr <dig> expression in healthy mice . seven days post infection, the increase of tlr <dig>  cells was observed in both groups of mice given probiotic bacteria , but not in the infection control , comparing with the untreated control group . this finding agrees with several works which affirm that cpg-tlr <dig> interaction can improve the resistance of normal adult mice to a variety of bacterial, viral and parasitic pathogens  <cit> , including increased resistance to oral challenge with s. typhimurium. tlr <dig> signalling is also required to mediate an anti-inflammatory effect induced by probiotics, in a mouse colitis model  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the results of the present work demonstrated the importance of l. casei crl  <dig> continuous administration, before and after s. typhimurium infection, to maintain the mechanisms of protection against this pathogen. l. casei crl  <dig> administration before infection maintained the innate immune system in alert state, through modulated expression of tlrs and cytokine signals in the effector and inductor site of the gut immune system, which could be related with the protection against s. typhimurium observed in a previous report. the results from the present work show that once established the disease, the continuous l. casei crl  <dig> administration protected the host mainly modulating the inflammatory response against the enteropathogen in both effector and inductor sites of the gut. this preliminary study shows some of the immune mechanisms implicated in the protective effect of l. casei crl  <dig> againts s. typhimurium infection. more studies should be performed to validate the use of this probiotic strain in the prevention and as a complement to treatments in the defense against salmonellosis.

the cellular populations involved in the cytokine production and how tlrs activate the different signals and the transcriptional factors for cytokine production are currently under study.
