BACKGROUND
aggregation of dictyostelium discoideum proceeds by an oriented migration of the amoebae towards a source of the attractant camp which is synthesized and released periodically by cells in the center of the aggregate. stimulation with camp activates liberation of stored ca2+ and extracellular ca2+-entry  <cit>  leading to a i-transient  <cit> . chemotaxis proceeds in the presence of extracellular egta but not in the presence of intracellular ca2+ buffers, so a i-elevation is necessary and release of stored ca2+ is sufficient for oriented migration  <cit> . on the other hand, the view that a i-increase is essential for chemotaxis was called into question by analysis of a cell line where the ipla gene was disrupted by homologous recombination  <cit> . the ipla gene is the only gene known in the dicyostelium genome so far that shares homology with ip3-receptors of higher eukaryotes. however, whether its protein product indeed constitutes a functional ip3-receptor and its cellular localization are not known. the ipla- mutant was found to aggregate and to form fruiting bodies although neither camp-activated 45ca2+-entry nor a i-elevation were detected  <cit> . from these results the authors concluded that the ipla gene product is central to the regulation of i and that its presence and thus the presence of an agonist-activated i-increase is not necessary for proper chemotaxis and development. however, agents that interfere with ip3-receptor mediated signaling such as xestosponginc  <cit>  were found to influence not only camp-induced ca2+-fluxes but also the chemotactic response and aggregation of dictyostelium  <cit> . in this study we aimed to clarify these conflicting findings and analyzed both, capacitative and chemoattractant-induced ca2+-fluxes and the effect of their disturbance on chemotaxis and differentiation of the ipla- mutant. mn2+-influx was used to determine the rates of ion fluxes into cells with filled and emptied stores and related to ca2+-electrode recordings in cell suspensions. we found that ion fluxes, chemotaxis and differentiation were sensitive towards alteration of the ca2+-homeostasis. capacitative ca2+-entry was normal in the mutant and upon stimulation with agonist ca2+- and mn2+-fluxes occurred, yet to a considerably reduced extent. spontaneous motility and chemotactic performance of mutant amoebae was strongly impaired by the intracellular presence of a ca2+-chelator.

RESULTS
extracellular  affects development and chemotaxis of wild type and ipla-
as ipla- cells formed fruiting bodies, albeit somewhat smaller in size, it was concluded that chemotactic aggregation and differentiation was normal  <cit> . we analyzed development of the mutant in parallel with wild type at various conditions. when cells differentiated on h5-agar plates  we consistently found a delay in the onset of aggregation by 1– <dig> h in the mutant; the smaller size of fruiting bodies was due to breaking of aggregation strands yielding smaller mounds . next we asked whether the absence or presence of ca2+ affects development. differentiation on egta-containing agar plates and thus the steady reduction of internal ca2+-levels dose dependently resulted in a delay of aggregation and a decrease in the size of aggregates and fruiting bodies in both strains. doses of 5– <dig> mm egta in the agar did not significantly alter the time point of aggregation which is in accordance with previous data  <cit>  showing requirement of additional multiple washing of amoebae with egta in order to affect aggregation. at concentrations of 15– <dig> mm egta however, aggregation occurred at later time points , on average at  <dig> ±  <dig> h in wild type and at  <dig> ±  <dig> h in ipla- cells ; despite the daily variations in aggregation timing the mutant strain was delayed as compared to the wild type in each of the experiments performed. on the other hand, the presence of ca2+ in the agar and therefore the continuous loading of cells with ca2+  <cit>  resulted in stronger impairment of aggregation in the wild type. the delayed aggregation of wild type cells in the presence of ca2+ was not due to inhibition of chemotaxis . now the formation of aggregates was observed consistently at earlier time points in the ipla- strain than in wild type ; indeed, under this condition differentiation of ipla- cells resembled that of wild type observed in the control situation.

then we analyzed the effect of treatment with either egta or ca2+ on basal cell motility. we found that under control conditions the general morphology of the cells as well as extension of pseudopods was practically identical in both strains . preincubation with  <dig> mm egta for  <dig> min led to strong rounding of wild type and mutant amoebae  with reduced extension of small pseudopods . by contrast, pretreatment with  <dig> mm cacl <dig> did not affect the morphology  or the extension of pseudopods  in both strains. next we tested chemotaxis of amoebae towards a camp-filled glass capillary. under control conditions cells of both strains oriented and migrated towards the tip of the capillary ; the average chemotactic speed was not different between wild type and the mutant strain . incubation in  <dig> mm egta for  <dig> min abolished chemotaxis in most of the wild type and the ipla- amoebae: small pseudopods were extended randomly and the cells did not approach the capillary tip . only rarely, cells of both strains exhibited an oriented but highly reduced migration towards the camp source . thus the loss of ca2+ from stores impairs both, orientation and migration also in the absence of the ipla gene product. by contrast, when amoebae were incubated in  <dig> mm cacl <dig> for  <dig> min to load stores, they oriented and migrated towards the camp capillary . the chemotactic speed of wild type cells  was comparable to that under control conditions whereas mutant amoebae chemotaxed significantly faster  than wild type cells in the presence of  <dig> mm cacl <dig> .

buffering of intracellular  impairs chemotaxis
the observation that aggregation occurred in the mutant cell line although a camp-activated increase in i was not detectable resulted in the conclusion that i-changes were not necessary to accomplish chemotaxis  <cit> . we used the mobile buffer approach originally described by speksnijder et al.  <cit>  which allows to analyze the requirement of a i-gradient for a given response. if in dictyostelium a i-increase was necessary for chemotaxis, the presence of a ca2+-chelator in the cytosol should impair orientation and/or migration. in a previous study, we had introduced the ca2+-chelator bapta and its derivatives into the cytosol of wild type amoebae which indeed had inhibited chemotactic migration and reduced chemotactic orientation  <cit> . here we used the ca2+-indicator fura2-dextran to clamp i and loaded the indicator into wild type and mutant cells in the absence of external cacl <dig>  the treatment affected chemotactic performance of wild type as well as ipla- amoebae. lack of extracellular cacl <dig> during the loading process induced strong rounding of the amoebae and loss of migration. figure  <dig> shows that the capacity to orient chemotactically and to extend pseudopods towards the capillary tip was reduced by 58% in wild type . inhibition was also evident in ipla- cells  showing sensitivity of the mutant towards buffering of intracellular ca2+-levels and eradication of i-changes: the fraction of pseudopods extended in direction of the camp-source was reduced by 75% . these results show that not only in wild type but also in the ipla- cell line the ability to orient and to migrate in fact depends on an agonist-activated i-elevation.

analysis of ca2+-fluxes
our findings that differentiation was sensitive towards depletion of ca2+ or loading of the cells with ca2+ and that chemotaxis was blocked by intracellular ca2+-buffers led us to investigate ca2+-fluxes in the mutant cell line. we used a ca2+-sensitive electrode in cell suspensions to measure ca2+-fluxes, an approach different from that of traynor et al.  <cit>  who had studied ion fluxes by 45ca2+-measurements. first we tested whether the coupling of stores to the plasma membrane, i.e. capacitative ca2+-fluxes without prior stimulation with agonists were altered. in dictyostelium induction of capacitative ca2+-influx requires active intracellular ca2+-pumps. their inhibition by either thapsigargin or  <dig> -di-- <dig> -hydroquinone  does not evoke influx; rather, stores have to be emptied by treatment with egta  <cit> . capacitative ca2+-fluxes were studied early during differentiation . at this time ca2+-influx and ca2+-efflux are at an equilibrium which held true for both, wild type and mutant cells ; in suspensions of cells at later stages of development influx strongly exceeds efflux  <cit> . in ipla- and in wild type cells emptying of storage compartments via preincubation of amoebae with egta induced capacitative ca2+-entry  which was blocked by addition of  <dig> mm nan <dig> . the characteristics of influx were comparable in wild type and mutant cells. these data show that capacitative ca2+-influx does not depend on the product of the ipla gene.

on the other hand, agonist-activated 45ca2+-entry had been reported to be absent in the mutant strain; in their study, traynor et al. had stimulated cells with camp in the presence of  <dig>  mm cacl <dig>  <cit> . the use of a ca2+-sensitive electrode allows to measure much lower levels of extracellular ca2+ to analyze ca2+-fluxes, in the range of approximately  <dig> μm ca2+. indeed, we found that under this condition reversible ca2+-entry occurred after addition of  <dig> μm camp  that amounted to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pmol ca2+/ <dig> cells . the level of influx represented roughly 5% of wild type influx . ca2+-influx was delayed in the mutant and the time to reach the maximum was longer than in wild type cells  <cit> . in addition, challenge with arachidonic acid  induced influx . again, the mutant was less sensitive and higher concentrations were required than those reported to evoke ca2+-entry in wild type cells . neither  <dig> nor  <dig> μm aa were effective; in the wild type  <dig> μm aa activates influx of  <dig> ±  <dig> pmol ca2+/ <dig> cells  <cit> . at  <dig> μm aa entry occurred in the mutant strain which amounted to an average of  <dig> ±  <dig> pmol ca2+/ <dig> cells . preincubation of cells with the serca-type ca2+-atpase inhibitor bhq reduced aa-induced influx by  <dig> %  to an average of  <dig> ±  <dig> pmol ca2+/ <dig> cells . these data show that ca2+-fluxes across the plasma membrane do occur in ipla- cells as well but at a reduced level.

next we tested whether the mutant strain was able to release stored ca2+ when stimulated with camp or aa. fluxes were measured in suspensions of cells with permeabilized plasma membranes; any change in e thus reflects efflux of ca2+ from storage compartments. both, camp and arachidonic acid activated release of stored ca2+ . on average, addition of  <dig> μm camp released  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pmol ca2+/ <dig> cells and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pmol ca2+/ <dig> cells were liberated after stimulation with  <dig> μm aa . the amount of ca2+-efflux from stores after camp stimulation was 61% of that found in wild type cells  whereas release upon aa-challenge was in the range of 5–10% of wild type . in addition to the ca2+-electrode recordings, we studied ca2+-fluxes in suspensions of partially purified storage compartments fluorimetrically. atp induced ca2+-sequestration  was of similar magnitude and rate as in wild type stores. this result indicates that the decreased release of ca2+ from the stores measured with the ca2+-electrode is not due to a lack of storage capacity. moreover, the addition of aa evoked release of ca2+ from stores as did inhibition of ca2+-pump by thapsigargin. xestosponginc that inhibits ca2+-uptake and activates ca2+-release in wild type  <cit>  and the ionophore ionomycin also resulted in substantial ca2+ release in the mutant cell line . all values were in the same range as those for wild type.

mn2+-quenching experiments
the e-recordings in suspensions of cells as described above detect the sum of ca2+-influx and efflux. therefore, a complementary approach which monitors influx only was pursued, by using the mn2+-quenching technique in single intact amoebae. this method is based on the fact that many ca2+-channels are permeable to mn2+  <cit>  and that the ca2+-indicator fura <dig> binds mn2+ with high affinity. fluorescence of the indicator is quenched upon binding  <cit> . we compared quenching of fura2-dextran fluorescence activated by addition of mn2+ alone or in combination with  <dig> μm camp in wild type and mutant cells. higher concentrations of mncl <dig> were required to quench fura2-dextran fluorescence in ipla- amoebae . reduction of fluorescence occurred at  <dig> μm mn2+ and  <dig> μm mn2+/camp in wild type  but not in the mutant  where addition of  <dig> μm mn2+/camp was necessary;  <dig> μm mn2+ alone was not effective  but started at  <dig> μm mn2+ . these data show that the reduction in ion fluxes in the mutant were indeed due to an alteration in entry mechanisms.

in principle, the ipla gene product could form a channel in the plasma membrane or in membranes of internal stores. the lack of the ipla gene product in the stores might impair their coupling to the plasma membrane. as we had observed capacitative ca2+-entry in the mutant we asked whether manipulation of the filling state of the stores altered ion fluxes. first we tested the effect of emptying of stores on mn2+-influx. when cells were preincubated with egta, the requirement for high doses of mn2+ to quench fluorescence was abrogated. now capacitative and also agonist-activated mn2+-influx occurred at concentrations of mncl <dig> comparable to those used under control conditions in wild type, in the range of 1– <dig> μm . this result renders the possibility that the plasma membrane is altered in the mutant unlikely. yet, the rate of mn2+-influx observed in egta-treated mutant amoebae was still less than in wild type cells with respect to both basal and camp-activated fluxes .

i-determination
in wild type cells treatment with egta augments responsiveness and camp-elicited i-transients are detected at low extracellular   <cit> . however, an agonist-induced i elevation was not observed in ipla- cells under these conditions. on the other hand, when stores were loaded in the continued presence of cacl <dig>  we observed that differentiation of the mutant resembled the wild type as described above. this led us to compare the i-response of wild type and mutant amoebae after pretreatment with cacl <dig>  in wild type cells preincubation with  <dig> mm cacl <dig> for 10– <dig> min and its continued presence during the i-imaging experiment is required to activate a i-transient after challenge with camp ; in nominally ca2+-free medium or at very low extracellular  a camp-activated i-elevation is not observed  <cit> . in accordance with the data of traynor et al.  <cit>  this condition  and even increasing the concentration of cacl <dig> to  <dig> mm resulted in no detectable i-increase in the mutant strain . however, we found that the basal i level in ipla- amoebae was significantly lower than in wild type and amounted to an average of  <dig> ±  <dig> nm  as compared to  <dig> ±  <dig> nm in wild type .

for stronger loading of ca2+-stores, we preincubated cells with  <dig> mm cacl <dig> for  <dig> h. after this treatment a i-elevation upon addition of camp was detected in 60% of wild type amoebae even at low extracellular  levels, i.e. when the buffer used to wash the cells had been supplemented with only  <dig> μm cacl <dig> . starting from a basal level of  <dig> ±  <dig> nm, the height of the i-transient amounted to  <dig> ±  <dig> nm . again, these conditions were not effective in ipla- cells; rather, the sensitivity of the mutant was shifted to higher ca2+ concentrations as had been found with mn2+-quenching experiments. we preincubated ipla- amoebae with  <dig> mm cacl <dig> for  <dig> h; after washing thoroughly, a camp-induced i-elevation in the presence of  <dig> mm cacl <dig> was observed  in 28% of the cells; its average height amounted to  <dig> ±  <dig> nm  starting from a basal level of  <dig> ±  <dig> nm. in the course of these experiments we once observed a response also under standard conditions, i.e. at  <dig> mm e without prior incubation in  <dig> mm cacl2; the height of the increase amounted to  <dig> ±  <dig> nm . yet, this was a rare event .

discussion
the role of camp-activated i-changes for chemotaxis has been questioned by traynor et al.  <cit>  who reported results obtained with the ipla- mutant cell line favouring insignificance of i for the chemotactic response. the authors had observed formation of fruiting bodies even though neither 45ca2+-fluxes nor an agonist induced i-elevation were detectable. the discrepancy between our view that a i-elevation is necessary for a proper chemotactic response  <cit>  and the conclusion of traynor et al. prompted us to analyze chemotaxis, differentiation and the -regulation of the ipla- mutant in detail. in particular, we tested not only basal and camp-activated ion fluxes but also capacitative ca2+-entry which is induced by emptying internal ca2+-stores via preincubation of amoebae with egta  <cit> .

aggregation and development of wild type and mutant cells on agar plates was sensitive towards continuous emptying or loading of ca2+-stores. these effects are not necessarily caused by altering chemotactic migration. it is conceivable that other ca2+-dependent processes were affected, e.g. that the timing or pattern of gene expression or the establishment of cell contacts was altered. although incubation of mutant amoebae for  <dig> h with  <dig> mm cacl <dig> or of wild type with  <dig> mm cacl <dig> for 4– <dig> h or with  <dig> mm egta for  <dig> h  <cit>  did not significantly increase or lower basal i it is possible that the continued presence of  <dig> mm egta or cacl <dig> for many hours affects basal levels of i which in turn might mediate effects on gene expression as was shown for prolonged incubation of cells with bhq  <cit> . during development dictyostelium cells form ca2+-dependent and edta/egta-sensitive cell-cell contacts that are mediated by gp <dig> and ddcad- <dig> . therefore, chelation of extracellular ca2+ might also inhibit cell adhesion. however, mutant cells whose gene encoding ddcad- <dig> had been disrupted show normal chemotaxis and cell streams. furthermore, mound formation was accelerated and only culmination was delayed by about  <dig> hours  <cit> . if only ca2+-dependent cell adhesion was affected in our development assay in the presence of egta we would expect a similar phenotype. however, aggregation was clearly delayed. this argues for additional ca2+-dependent processes during aggregation.

when we tested the influence of the presence of egta or cacl <dig> on spontaneous motility and chemotaxis we found that in both strains motility in general was strongly impaired and that chemotaxis of the amoebae towards the camp-filled glass capillary was virtually abolished upon depletion of internal stores by the extracellular presence of egta. this effect is time dependent; after  <dig> min of incubation with  <dig> mm egta the behaviour of wild type amoebae was found to be unaltered and only after treatment for  <dig> – <dig> h rounding and reduction of pseudopod elongation towards the capillary tip occurred  <cit> . prolonged incubation for more than  <dig> h as carried out in this study completely inhibited the chemotactic response. these results strengthen the view that ca2+ has a necessary role in chemotaxis in wild type and in the mutant as well. when the cellular ca2+ content falls below a critical value ca2+-dependent cytoskeletal rearrangements  <cit>  that are necessary for both, random pseudopod extension during spontaneous motility and oriented pseudopod formation after chemotactic stimulation no longer take place correctly. on the other hand, the presence of  <dig> mm cacl <dig> induced no alteration of basal cell motility in wild type or mutant amoebae. yet, during chemotactic stimulation the average speed of migration towards the capillary tip was higher in mutant than in wild type cells. in this respect it is of importance that the basal level of i was significantly lower in the former. at standard conditions the reduced basal i does not impair the capacity of the mutant to chemotax. therefore, this particular mutant strain represents the "minimal solution" with respect to the concentration of cytosolic ca2+ necessary to accomplish cytoskeletal rearrangements and extrusion of a pseudopod correctly. however, in the presence of  <dig> mm extracellular ca2+ during camp-stimulation ca2+-fluxes are enhanced allowing more efficient formation of pseudopods. we had shown previously that a small global elevation of i activates the extension of pseudopods all over the cell's circumference whereas a larger increase induces contraction of the amoebae  <cit> . in our view, the strongest evidence that a i-transient is necessary for the extension of pseudopods rests upon the experiment where a ca2+-chelator was introduced into the cytosol of the amoebae. this treatment led to rounding of the amoebae and a general reduction of pseudopod formation . upon stimulation with a camp-filled capillary, the extension of oriented pseudopods was greatly reduced and migration towards the capillary tip was abolished. as speksnijder et al.  <cit>  had pointed out the fact that the presence of a chelator has an effect shows that a i-gradient is essential for a given response. in summary, these data support the notion that an elevation of i is required to extend pseudopods; suppression of the i-elevation inhibits motility in general. upon chemotactic challenge with camp this i-gradient has to be established in a locally restricted fashion in order to allow local, oriented pseudopod formation ; otherwise pseudopods would be extended in all directions . our results imply that in ipla- cells such a i-gradient occurs as well, either nonrestricted allowing extension of pseudopods at random sites during spontaneous motility or restricted locally after chemotactic stimulation leading to oriented pseudopod formation. the fact that in the mutant cell line camp-activated i-changes were practically undetectable under our standard condition argue for a i-increase that is either smaller and/or more restricted to distinct domains within the cell than in wild type amoebae. indeed, in only one out of roughly  <dig> determinations did we observe a camp-activated i-transient under standard conditions. these results imply a crucial role but not an absolute necessity of the ipla gene product for the regulation of camp-induced i-changes.

by using a ca2+-sensitive electrode in cell suspensions, we analyzed which aspects of i are controlled by the ipla gene product. besides studying agonist-induced ca2+-fluxes we also investigated capacitative ca2+-entry and found that this type of influx was similar in mutant and wild type cell suspensions. we obtained equivalent results by testing mn2+-quenching of fura2-dextran fluorescence which showed that capacitative entry is independent of the ipla gene product.

on the other hand, using the ca2+-sensitive electrode, we found that in the ipla- mutant the agonist camp and also aa did activate ca2+-entry into intact cells. the difference between the data published by traynor et al.  <cit>  and our results is most likely due to the experimental conditions: the magnitude of the ca2+-fluxes that we observed was considerably lower than in wild type cells and detectable at low extracellular  only. the 45ca2+-flux studies had been performed at  <dig> μm external cacl2; so the fraction of 45ca2+ entering the cells was presumably too low to be detected reliably. moreover, we found camp- and aa-induced ca2+-release from stores in cells with permeabilized plasma membranes. these data show that camp-induced ca2+-release from stores in ipla- cells is functional. however, much like the ca2+-influx, agonist-activated liberation from stores was smaller than in wild type amoebae. in line with these results are the findings using mn2+-quenching to assay ion fluxes in intact single cells: higher doses of mn2+ were necessary to detect influx.

there are several interpretations for the results above.  there are two types of channels responsible for ca2+-influx: one type being activated by emptying of the stores and sustaining capacitative ca2+-entry which is unaffected in ipla- cells and the other one mediating agonist-induced ca2+-fluxes, the latter being under the control of the ipla gene product. the view that there are two strictly separated ion channels seems unlikely as under conditions of emptied stores camp-activated mn2+-quenching occurred in the mutant as well.  the same channel mediate capacitative and agonist-activated fluxes but upon stimulation with agonists it cannot be addressed properly when ipla is disrupted. this implies a role of the protein in the liberation of ca2+ from the stores which is a prerequisite for the triggering of ca2+-entry  <cit> . in the mutant this cannot proceed normally so subsequent activation of ca2+-influx and the generation of a full i-increase is impaired. the results of the experiments where stores were strongly loaded with ca2+ prior to stimulation support this notion. in this situation release from stores should be augmented. indeed, in both, wild type and mutant cells, camp-activated i-elevations occurred at an extracellular   where without pretreatment no increase was observed. presumably, release of ca2+ from the filled stores contributed to the observed i-increase to a greater extent than under standard conditions. the requirement for  <dig> fold higher concentrations of cacl <dig> during preincubation to elicit an agonist-induced i-elevation in ipla- cells are most likely due to the reduction in ca2+-entry which necessitates a higher concentration gradient across the plasma membrane to fill the stores efficiently.

an as yet unresolved issue is the mechanism that induces ca2+-entry upon liberation of ca2+ from the stores. from our data we conclude that in dictyostelium these signals are different when the stores are emptied by egta or by agonist-activated signaling cascades. otherwise one cannot explain normal capacitative ca2+- and mn2+-influx induced by egta-treatment and a requirement for  <dig> fold higher ion concentrations to induce mn2+-entry by camp. if indeed the ipla gene product constitutes an ip3-receptor like channel that is located on membranes of stores the physical coupling of the receptor to channels in the plasma membrane as a mechanism to activate extracellular ca2+-entry  <cit>  should be missing in the mutant. on the other hand, emptying of stores by egta-treatment influences not only the ip3-sensitive store but also other stores and thus exerts a much more general effect on the cells. studies using microarrays should reveal whether the expression of other genes is affected by the absence of ipla and thus might give a clue how i is regulated in the mutant although one type of ca2+-store is malfunctional.

CONCLUSIONS
our results show that ca2+ fluxes and regulation of ca2+ homeostasis take place in the ipla- mutant and that chemotaxis and development of the mutant are sensitive to disturbance of the ca2+ homeostasis. in wild type cells and in cells lacking the ipla gene changes in i are necessary to orient and to migrate chemotactically; their abolition causes loss of chemotaxis towards a camp source. the ipla gene product exerts a crucial role in the control of basal i and of agonist induced ca2+-fluxes. it is not required to activate capacitative ca2+-influx. thus the mechanisms responsible for capacitative and agonist-activated ca2+-fluxes are different.
