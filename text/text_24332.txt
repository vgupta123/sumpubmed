BACKGROUND
clinical infection due to drug-resistant bacteria is a serious challenge to patient safety
 <cit> . in the united states, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  is estimated to cause ~ <dig>  deaths per year
 <cit> . mrsa is also a considerable threat in china, where the resistance ratio among hospital-acquired infections reaches almost 90%
 <cit> . apart from mrsa, several multidrug-resistant  and pan-drug-resistant  gram-negative bacteria, including pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii, and klebsiella pneumoniae, are emerging as additional major threat to public health
 <cit> . unfortunately, few novel drugs have been developed specifically for mdr/pdr gram-negative bacteria in recent years
 <cit> . the development of new antimicrobial agents cannot keep up with the evolution of bacterial resistance. thus, more efforts should be placed on discovering and developing new antimicrobial agents.

as a source of new antibiotics, food-associated microorganisms have recently received increased attention. the well-known active compounds produced by these strains are peptide antibiotics, such as lantibiotics and lipopeptides
 <cit> . many of them are potentially useful in medical and food applications due to their low intestinal toxicity. to obtain antimicrobial agents that are novel safe and potent, a lot of food bacteria were isolated and screened for their antimicrobial activity. in this work, strain b <dig>  a new bacterial isolate from a sample of dairy waste, was found to produce antibiotics against both gram-positive and gram-negative human pathogens. based on the 16s rrna gene sequence analysis as well as physiological and biochemical characterization, strain b <dig> was identified as paenibacillus ehimensis. after isolation and purification of the fermentation products, the chemical structure and biological characteristics of the active compounds produced by p. ehimensis b <dig> were determined.

samples of dairy waste were collected from a local dairy industry in wuxi. the dairy waste samples were suspended in  <dig> % sterile peptone water and antibiotic producing strains were isolated using a competitive inhibition method as previously described
 <cit> . nutrition broth was used for routine culture. the active compounds were produced in synthetic katznelson and lochhead  medium, which had the following composition : glucose, 5; 2so <dig>   <dig> ; mgso <dig> h2o,  <dig> ; nacl,  <dig> ; cac <dig>   <dig> ; feso <dig> h2o,  <dig> ; znso <dig>   <dig> ; mnso <dig> h2o,  <dig> ; and kh2po <dig>  <dig> . the medium was autoclaved and brought to a ph of  <dig> . staphylococcus epidermis cmcc  <dig> was purchased from the national center for medical culture collections. s. aureus atcc  <dig>  s. aureus atcc  <dig>  e. coli atcc  <dig>  and p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig> were purchased from the american type culture collection . clinical isolates  were isolated from patients at the fourth people’s hospital of wuxi, wuxi, china. the tested strains that were used to determine the sensitivity to the active compounds were routinely grown at 37°c on a nutrient agar or in a nutrient broth. for long-term storage, all of the strains were stored in 20%  glycerol at −80°c. this study was approved by the ethics committee of the fourth people’s hospital of wuxi.

production and purification of active compounds
strain b <dig> maintained on nutrient agar slants was inoculated into 50 ml of nutrient broth and cultivated at 30°c for 24 h. the seed culture of strain b <dig> was transferred to a 2l erlenmeyer flask that contained 500 ml of the kl medium. the culture was incubated on a rotary shaker  at 30°c for  <dig> d. after centrifugation at 4500 g for 30 min at 4°c, the cell-free supernatant was loaded onto a column packed with amberlite xad- <dig> resin . the column was washed with distilled water prior to elution with stepwise gradients of aqueous methanol . each fraction was concentrated and assessed for activity using the paper disc method. the active fraction was evaporated and dried before being redissolved in acetonitrile. the concentrated solution was then applied to a c <dig> spe column . the column was washed with five bed volumes of distilled water, followed by five bed volumes of an acetonitrile/water mixture . the fraction that contained the active compounds was eluted from the column by washing with three bed volumes of an acetonitrile/water mixture . further purification was performed using a preparative hplc system  that was equipped with an ymc-pack dos-a c <dig>  column. the mobile phase consisted of milli-q water that contained  <dig> % trifluoroacetic acid and acetonitrile. a linear gradient of 15% to 55% acetonitrile  was used for elution at a flow rate of 10 ml/min. uv detection was performed at a wavelength of 210 nm. fractions from multiple runs were collected and combined for the subsequent antimicrobial activity assays. the active fractions were passed through the hplc column two consecutive times.

amino acid analysis
approximately 300 μg of the purified compound in  <dig>  ml of 6 m hcl with  <dig> % phenol was hydrolyzed at 110°c for 16 h. amino acid analyses was performed using ion-exchange chromatography with a hitachi l- <dig> amino acid analyzer  according to the method described by qian et al.
 <cit> . the absolute configuration of amino acids was determined using 1-fluoro- <dig> -dinitrophenyl-5-d-leucinamide  and 1-fluoro- <dig> -1-fluoro- <dig> -dinitrophenyl-5-l-leuci-namide  as derivatizing agents. fdla derivative analysis was performed as previously described
 <cit> .

mass spectrometry analysis
electrospray ionization  mass spectra were acquired in positive ion mode on a thermo finnigan lcq mass spectrometer . the esi-mass spectrometry  conditions included a capillary voltage of 40 v, a source voltage of  <dig>  kv, and a capillary temperature of 300°c. to obtain the amino acid sequences, collision induced dissociation  was applied to the purified lipopeptide antibiotics.

antibacterial activity assay
during fermentation and purification, antimicrobial activity was determined using the paper disc method
 <cit> . the minimum inhibitory concentrations  of the purified antibiotics were determined using a microbroth dilution method according to the national committee for clinical laboratory standards . the final concentrations of the antibiotics in the medium ranged from  <dig> to 64 μg/ml. mics were measured after incubation at 37°c for 20 h. to determine the effect of divalent cations on the mode action of purified compounds, 10 mm cacl <dig> or mgcl <dig> was added to the test medium.

nucleotide accession number
the nucleotide sequence of 16s rrna gene of strain b <dig> has been deposited in genbank under the accession number jx <dig> 

RESULTS
identification of strain b7
the bacteria strain b <dig> that is active against mrsa atcc  <dig> and p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig> was selected for further investigation. morphologically, strain b <dig> was characterized to be a rod-shaped, spore-forming, motile, gram-positive bacterium. aerobic growth of b <dig> occurred at a temperature between  <dig> and 50°c and a ph between  <dig> and  <dig>  optimal conditions included a temperature of 30°c and a ph of  <dig>  the bacteria strain b <dig> was negative for urease and positive for catalase, oxidase, methyl red test, and nitrate reduction. starch, chitin, and gelatin were hydrolyzed by strain b <dig>  acid was produced from d-mannitol, d-gentiobiose, d-xylose, d-mannose, l-arabinose, mannitol, and glucose. the g + c content of the strain dna was  <dig> %. the major fatty acid of strain b <dig> was anteiso-c15: <dig>  making up to  <dig> % of the total fatty acids, a characteristic of the genus paenibacillus. the b <dig> isolate and p. ehimensis ifo 15659t showed identical 16s rrna gene sequences
 <cit> , which suggests that they are members of the same species. this inference was further confirmed by the dna-dna hybridization results. the dna-dna re-association between strain b <dig> and p. ehimensis ifo 15659t was  <dig> %. all of these characteristics supported the identification of the isolate as a member of p. ehimensis. thus, strain b <dig> was named p. ehimensis b <dig> 

purification of antibiotics produced by p. ehimensis b7
p. ehimensis b <dig> grew well and produced active compounds in the kl medium. bioactivity was detectable approximately 20 h after inoculation and reached a maximum level at 96 h. the cultures were separated into supernatant and cell pellets by centrifugation. before purification, the stability of the antibiotics that were present in the culture supernatant was investigated according to a previously described method
 <cit> . the active compounds were stable at a ph of  <dig>  to  <dig> , and their antimicrobial activities were also not affected by heat treatment at  <dig> or 80°c for 1 h.

the antibiotics were easily absorbed from the culture supernatant by amberlite xad- <dig> resin. the resin was washed with distilled water and then eluted with stepwise gradients of aqueous methanol. one fraction that was eluted with 100% methanol exhibited the most significant antimicrobial activity. this fraction was extracted with a spe cartridge and further separated by hplc. two active compounds that were eluted at retention times of  <dig>  and  <dig>  min were obtained and named pe <dig> and pe <dig>  respectively. the final yield was approximately  <dig>  mg/l for pe <dig> and  <dig>  mg/l for pe <dig> 

structure analysis
esi-ms analysis indicated that pe <dig> had a molecular mass of 1114 da, and pe <dig> had a molecular weight of  <dig>  da. the two molecular masses differed from each other by 14 da, suggesting that they were homologues. amino acid analysis demonstrated that these two compounds had the same amino acid composition, and both of them contained l-  <dig> -diaminobutyric acid , l-leucine , l-isoleucine , l-threonine , d-phenylalanine , and d-valine , with molar ratios of 3:2:1:1:1: <dig>  which further confirmed that they were structural close-related peptide antibiotics.

after alkaline hydrolysis , the purified compounds with protonated molecular masses of  <dig>  and  <dig>  da, yielded two new products, with + ions of  <dig>  and  <dig>  da, respectively. the 18 da increase in mass was attributed to the hydrolysis of a lactone. this result indicated that the two compounds were cyclic lipopeptide antibiotics. the ms/ms spectrum of the doubly charged precursor ion of the hydrolyzed compound at m/z  <dig>  with a mass of 1133 da was shown in figure 
 <dig>  successive fragmentations from the two termini of the ring-opened lipopeptide resulted in b-type ions at m/z  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , along with corresponding y-type ions detected at m/z  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> . these fragment ions allowed for the assignment of the following sequence: ile/leu-dab-phe- leu/ile-dab-val-leu/ile-thr-oh. the b-type ions at m/z  <dig>  corresponded to fatty acid -dab, which indicated that the fatty acyl moiety has the elemental composition of c7h12o <dig> 

the ring-opened pe <dig> with a mass + of  <dig>  da was also analyzed by cid. the tandem mass spectrum of this derivative was shown in figure 
 <dig>  all of the b-type ions that were generated from this doubly charged precursor ion 2+ at m/z  <dig>  were 14 da less than those generated from the precursor ion 2+ at m/z  <dig> . however, the two y-type ion series for the two compounds were almost the same in mass, which indicated that the two compounds had identical amino acid sequences but different fatty acid chains. similar to pe <dig>  pe <dig> also produced a fragment ion at m/z  <dig> , which corresponded to the loss of 214 da from the + ion. examination of the neutral fragment that was lost suggested that it contains a dab residue and a fatty acyl moiety . these results further confirmed that the two compounds were different in their fatty acyl moieties.

apart from in the c-terminal amino acid , no hydroxyl group was found in the peptide moieties of p. ehimensis lipopeptides studied here. thus, a lactone linkage was only formed between the carboxyl group of the c-terminal and the hydroxyl group of fatty acid moieties. the proposed structures for pe <dig> and pe <dig> are showed in figure 
 <dig> 

antimicrobial activities of the purified compounds
the antimicrobial activities of the purified compounds pe <dig> and pe <dig> were measured using micro dilution methods. table 
 <dig> showed that pe <dig> and pe <dig> both had a similar level of strong activity against all of the tested gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens as well as candida albicans. the mics of the compounds were lower than those of commercial polymyxin b in the cases of gram-positive bacteria. in the case of e. coli atcc  <dig>  e. coli  <dig>  and p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig>  the mics of pe <dig> and pe <dig> were higher than that of polymyxin b. interestingly, p. aeruginosa  <dig>  a pan-drug resistant clinical isolate, was highly sensitive to pe <dig> and pe <dig>  with mics of 2 μg/ml that was slightly lower than that of polymyxin b.

time-kill assays
to further evaluate the growth inhibition effect of newly isolated antibiotics, killing experiments of pe <dig> and pe <dig> against s. aureus atcc  <dig> and p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig> were performed. the time-kill curves of pe <dig> against both strains were similar to pe <dig> . in the case of p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig>  all of the tested antibiotics at 4 × mic rapidly reduced the number of viable cells of this strain by at least  <dig> orders of magnitude over the first 3 h of exposure, and no bacteria could be detected after a 24 h incubation. in the case of s. aureus atcc  <dig>  the number of viable cells counted also dramatically decreased within a period of 3 h following the addition of these two compounds, although substantial re-growth occurred after 24 h. thus, pe <dig> and pe <dig> were determined to be bactericidal at high concentrations, which is consistent with the characteristics of other cationic cyclic lipopeptides
 <cit> .

effect of divalent cations on antibacterial activity
to determine the effect of divalent cations on the antibacterial activity of the lipopeptides that are produced by p. ehimensis b <dig>  the mics of pe <dig> against s. aureus atcc  <dig> and p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig> were determined in mh medium with 10 mm ca2+ or mg2+. in normal medium, the mics of pe <dig> for s. aureus atcc  <dig> and p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig> were  <dig> and 8 μg/ml, respectively. however, the mics of pe <dig> for s. aureus atcc  <dig> and p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig> increased to  <dig> and >64 μg/ml, respectively, when 10 mm cacl <dig> was added to the test medium. similar results were obtained when mg2+ was added instead of ca2+ .

cytotoxicity
the cytotoxicity of the purified compounds  against mammalian cells was tested by the cck- <dig> assay. pe <dig> and pe <dig> showed little cytotoxicity against hek293t cells  at all of concentrations that were tested  .

discussion
in the present study, b <dig>  a new bacterial strain with potent antimicrobial activity was isolated from a dairy waste sample, and identified as p. ehimensis. phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rrna gene indicated that the isolate was closely related to p. elgii, p. koreensis, and p. tianmuensis . this group of bacteria produces diverse antimicrobial agents, including lipopeptides
 <cit> , lantibiotics
 <cit>  and macrolide
 <cit> . interestingly, most extensively described lipopeptide antibiotics from this group of bacteria contain a high percentage of both dab and a c6-c <dig> n-terminal fatty acyl chain
 <cit> .

the active compounds  that are produced by p. ehimensis b <dig> were structurally similar to the lipopeptide polypeptins  that were previously isolated from bacillus circulum <cit> . polypeptin is a group of polypeptide antibiotics composed of a cyclic nonapeptide moiety and a fatty acid side chain. to date, five polypeptin-type antibiotics, including polypeptin a, polypeptin b, permetin a, bmy- <dig>  and pelgipeptin d, have been extensively described
 <cit> . polypeptins a and b, which have the same molecular formula, have identical amino acid moieties but vary in the structure of fatty acids. bmy- <dig> and permetin a only differ from each other at position  <dig> in peptide moieties . pelgipeptin d and permetin a only differ from each other in the fatty acid moiety, while permetin a differs from polypeptin a only in the amino acid at position  <dig> . polypeptin-type antibiotics were known to have a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against many gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria
 <cit> . the molecular mass of pe <dig> was identical to that of polypeptin a and b, and the amino acid sequences and antimicrobial spectra were extremely similar, suggesting pe <dig> and polypeptin  are most likely the same compound. however, pe <dig> was characterized as a new analog of polypeptin because pe <dig> and polypeptin contained identical peptide moieties, but differed from each other by a molecular mass of 14 da in fatty acid chains. although ile and leu cannot be distinguished by tandem mass spectrometry, there are two reasons for us to assign ile at position  <dig>  and leu at positions  <dig> and  <dig> in the pe peptide antibiotics . firstly, the amino acid compositions of pe and polypeptin are identical, including the molar ratios of amino acids and their absolute configurations. secondly, positions  <dig> and  <dig> of the peptide moieties in all of the extensively described members of polypeptin are leu, whereas ile or val is present in their peptide moieties at position 2
 <cit> .

the active modes of cationic lipopeptides generally involve the interaction of positive charged residues with bacterial cell wall, which is normally stabilized by divalent cations 
 <cit> . this is consistent with our results that the addition of 10 mm ca2+ or mg2+ significantly reduced the susceptibility of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria to lipopeptides from p. ehimensis. in addition to positive residues, the fatty acyl chain and amphipathic structure also contribute to the antimicrobial activity of cationic peptides
 <cit> . although polypeptin and polymyxin are structurally related cyclic lipopeptides with several basic amino acids, their antimicrobial potencies and spectra are significantly different. polypeptin has a broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, whereas polymyxin is potently active mainly against gram-negative bacteria. the selectivity of lipopeptide antibiotics may be attributable to their differential binding affinities to the external and/or cytoplasmic membrane of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. understanding the action mode of polypeptin may provide some useful clues toward developing novel lipopeptide antibiotics.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, two active compounds  were obtained from the newly isolated strain p. ehimensis. structural analysis indicated that they were analogs of polypeptin, and pe <dig> was characterized as a novel analog of polypeptin. these two compounds showed potent activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens, including mrsa and pan-drug resistant p. aeruginosa. although the present results provide some valuable information about the cyclic lipopeptide antibiotics that are produced by paenibacillus ehimensis, further studies are needed to determine their potential clinical utility.
