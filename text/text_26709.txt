BACKGROUND
autotransporter proteins form the largest known family of virulence factors expressed by gram-negative bacteria, and play central roles in processes such as cell-to-cell aggregation, biofilm formation, serum resistance, and adherence to host epithelial cells  <cit> . the members of this family share structural features that include a surface-exposed passenger domain specifying the biological activity of the protein and a c-terminal transporter module comprised of several β-strands that anchors the autotransporter in the outer membrane . based on the length and structure of this transporter module, autotransporters can be classified as conventional  or trimeric   <cit> . one of the better characterized trimeric autotransporter molecules is the yersinia enterocolitica adhesin yada; yada and structurally related autotransporters are also often referred to as oca  proteins  <cit> . because of their structure and role in pathogenesis, autotransporters represent promising targets for anti-infective approaches. large portions of these proteins  are located on the bacterial surface and are therefore amenable to recognition by the immune system. in addition, autotransporters play key roles in virulence and targeting them may interfere with development of disease.

moraxella catarrhalis is a gram-negative bacterium that causes a wide range of infections, including ~20% of all cases of bacterial otitis media in children  <cit> , up to 10% of lung infections in elderly patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease   <cit> , sinusitis  <cit> , and conjunctivitis  <cit> . this organism is a significant health concern, and complicating this problem is the fact that most m. catarrhalis clinical isolates display resistance to antibiotics including β-lactams  <cit> . the development of a vaccine for m. catarrhalis thus has increasing importance for the health status of both the elderly and the very young. this bacterium expresses several autotransporter proteins that have been well-studied including the trimeric/oca adhesins uspa <dig>  <cit> , uspa2h  <cit> , and hag/mid  <cit> , the trimeric/oca serum resistant factor uspa <dig>  <cit> , and the conventional autotransporter adhesin/phospholipase b mcap  <cit> .

expression of hag, or its ortholog mid , is important for attachment to erythrocytes as well as a <dig>  and hmee  cells  <cit> , and hag directly mediates adherence to hmee cells  <cit> . in addition, hag binds immunoglobulin d and forms oligomers  <cit> . the gene coding for this protein is found in almost all m. catarrhalis isolates studied to date  <cit> , and specifies a relatively well-conserved molecule of ~ <dig>  residues in length. expression of hag is subject to translational phase variation, via slipped strand mispairing in a homopolymeric guanine tract located near the beginning of the orf  <cit> . hag has also been found to contain a series of degenerate amino acid  repeats similar to those present in the n-terminus of the prototypical oca adhesin yada and which specify the adhesive properties of this y. enterocolitica protein  <cit> .

in this study, we sought to determine what role hag plays in m. catarrhalis adherence to lung mucoepidermoid  and conjunctival  cells by measuring the binding of hag isogenic mutants and of recombinant e. coli expressing wild-type  hag genes to these human cells. we also sought to identify the region of hag important for adherence using a panel of in-frame hag deletion constructs.

RESULTS
hag expression is important for the adherence of m. catarrhalis to ncih <dig> and chang cells in vitro
previous work demonstrated that hag plays an important role in the attachment of m. catarrhalis to hmee cells and a <dig> human type ii pneumocytes  <cit> . to further explore the role of this protein in adherence to human epithelial cells that are relevant to pathogenesis by m. catarrhalis, a panel of previously-described wt isolates and cognate hag mutant strains  <cit>  were tested for their ability to bind to ncih <dig> lung mucoepidermoid and chang conjunctival cells. of note, these mutants were previously shown to have reduced adherence to a <dig> and hmee cells  <cit> .

strain tta <dig> attached poorly to ncih <dig> monolayers and the adherence of its hag mutant, tta <dig> hag, was not significantly lower . hag-deficient strains derived from isolates v <dig>  o35e, mcghs <dig> and o12e did not attach as efficiently to ncih <dig> cells as their respective wt progenitors . the binding of v <dig> hag, o35e.tn <dig> and mcghs <dig> hag to these monolayers was about a third that of their parent strains v <dig>  o35e, and mcghs <dig>  respectively. though the two-fold difference between strains o12e and o12e.hag was not statistically significant, the preponderance of our data suggests that hag expression is important for the adherence of m. catarrhalis to ncih <dig> lung cells.

similar results were obtained when the wt and isogenic mutant strains were tested for their ability to bind to chang conjunctival cells. the hag mutants of strains v <dig>  o12e and mcghs <dig> all adhered significantly less than their wt progenitors . strain tta <dig> attached well to chang cells  and the adherence of its hag deficient mutant tta <dig> hag was reduced by 93%. strain o35e.tn <dig> did not show hag-dependent binding to chang cells, though strain o35e did not attach as well to these monolayers as the other wt m. catarrhalis isolates tested. taken together, these results indicate that hag expression is important for the binding of m. catarrhalis to conjunctival cells. of note, all strains tested in this study were previously shown to express wt levels of the adhesins uspa2h , uspa <dig>  mcap, and ompcd  <cit> , yet we found that hag deletions still substantially reduce adherence.

hag directly confers binding to ncih <dig> cells and murine type iv collagen
it is possible that absence of hag in the om of m. catarrhalis mutants affected the proper display of other adhesins, which themselves mediate adherence to ncih <dig> and chang monolayers. to determine whether hag directly mediates binding to these epithelial cells, recombinant e. coli strains previously shown to express the hag gene product of m. catarrhalis strain o12e, o35e or v <dig>  <cit>  were tested in quantitative attachment assays. of note, these clones were previously shown to have gained the ability to attach to hmee cells  <cit> . as shown in fig. 2a, o12e-, o35e- and v1171-hag conferred on e.coli the ability to bind to ncih <dig> cells at levels that were ~5-, ~10- and ~15-fold greater than e. coli carrying the control plasmid pcc <dig> , respectively. in contrast, e. coli expressing these three hag proteins did not show significant increases in binding to chang monolayers . these results demonstrate that hag directly mediates adherence to ncih <dig> cells, but its expression is not sufficient to increase the binding of recombinant e. coli to chang monolayers.

based on sequence and structural similarities, hag belongs to the oca family of autotransporter adhesins  <cit> . y. enterocolitica yada is the prototypical member of this family and has been shown to directly mediate adherence to different types of collagen  <cit> , including type iv  <cit> . e. coli cells expressing the hag protein of m. catarrhalis strain o35e, o12e or v <dig> were therefore tested for their ability to bind to murine type iv collagen. as shown in fig. 2c, e. coli expressing o12e- and v1171-hag were ~ <dig> times more adherent to collagen than the negative control while recombinant bacteria expressing o35e-hag exhibited a ~80-fold increase in binding. these data indicate that hag proteins from different m. catarrhalis isolates directly mediate attachment to murine type iv collagen when expressed in the e. coli background. however, our panel of m. catarrhalis wt and isogenic mutant strains all bound poorly to collagen-coated wells .

construction and surface-expression of mutated hag proteins
to define the region of hag important for adherence to epithelial cells and collagen, several in-frame deletions were engineered in the hag orf of strain o35e . fig.  <dig> illustrates the various deletion constructs that were made. these mutated hag proteins were tested for their ability to mediate the binding of recombinant e. coli to ncih <dig> cells, hmee cells and murine collagen . sarkosyl-insoluble om proteins were also prepared from recombinant e. coli expressing these constructs, and tested by immunoblotting with hag-reactive antibodies. as shown in fig.  <dig>  all mutated hag proteins were associated with the om. the polyclonal antibodies used in these westerns are against the last  <dig> residues of o35e-hag  and encompass the transporter domain . this portion of oca adhesins has been shown to be important for oligomerization properties, which likely accounts for the multiple bands reacting with anti-hag antibodies in fig.  <dig> 

to verify that these om-located hag proteins were exposed on the bacterial surface, intact recombinant e. coli cells were treated with proteinase k and analyzed by western blot using antibodies against hag. as controls, proteinase k-treated bacteria were also probed with a monoclonal antibody against the inner membrane-anchored protein tonb  <cit>  to demonstrate that a minimal amount of the enzyme transversed across the om and into the periplasm of e. coli. fig.  <dig> shows the results of a representative experiment in which e. coli carrying the plasmids pelo <dig> hag, pbbhs <dig>  and pbbhs <dig>  were incubated for  <dig> min on ice in the absence  or presence  of proteinase k. as shown in fig. 5a, incubation with the enzyme decreases the reactivity of the hag-specific monoclonal antibody 5d <dig> to the cell lysates. by contrast, little to no degradation of tonb was observed under these conditions . longer incubation with proteinase k resulted in the near-complete digestion of hag but also caused partial degradation of tonb . the data are therefore consistent with the hag proteins being exposed on the surface of recombinant bacteria ; similar results were obtained when e. coli expressing the other mutated hag proteins were treated with this enzyme .

adhesive properties of recombinant hag proteins containing in-frame deletions
as previously reported  <cit> , one striking similarity between the y. enterocolitica adhesin yada and o35e-hag is the presence of degenerate aa sequence repeats in their n-termini, which in yada form coiled parallel structures described as a β-roll  <cit> . o35e-hag contains  <dig> such n-terminal repeats between residues 85– <dig>  having the consensus sequence gxxsiaigxxxax. for comparison, the yada β-roll repeats are xxxsvaigxxsxax  <cit> . in this y. enterocolitica adhesin, the repeated motifs are followed by a "neck" region , which is also present in o35e-hag after the β-roll repeats . of significance, the β-roll specifies the adhesive properties of yada, and an intact neck region appears to be essential for the proper display/stability of the β-roll since mutations in either area abolishes yada-dependent binding to human cells and collagen  <cit> . based on these observations, we hypothesized that the β-roll and neck region located in the n-terminus of o35e-hag are responsible for epithelial cell and/or collagen binding functions. to test this hypothesis, the region of hag encompassing only the β-roll repeats  or the β-roll structure and its associated neck  were deleted. as shown in columns h and c of fig.  <dig>  these mutations did not affect binding to hmee cells or collagen, respectively. in addition, e. coli cells expressing these two deletion constructs attached to ncih <dig> monolayers well above background levels . these results oppose the hypothesis that the n-terminal β-roll and associated neck region of o35e-hag specify adhesive properties.

unlike yada, which contains only one β-roll/neck combination, o35e-hag contains a second neck region in its c-terminus  preceded by a β-roll structure containing  <dig> "gxxsiaigxxxax" repeats . this second β-roll/neck combination of o35e-hag is located prior to a predicted membrane anchoring module and is presumably located on the bacterial surface as part of hag's autotransporter passenger domain. to determine whether this c-terminal β-roll structure specifies adhesive properties, residues 1546– <dig> xax" motifs) were removed in construct  <dig> , which also contains the deletion of the n-terminal β-roll/neck area . expression of this doubly-deleted hag protein still conferred on e. coli cells the ability to bind to hmee cells, collagen and lung cells at or near wt levels . by contrast, recombinant bacteria expressing the mutated adhesin construct  <dig> , which retains both β-roll/neck combinations but is missing residues 436– <dig> , no longer adhere to either epithelial cells or collagen . these results therefore support rejection of the hypothesis that the β-roll structures of o35e-hag specify adhesive properties as they do in yada. our data also suggest that residues 385– <dig> encompass the collagen and epithelial cell binding domain of this m. catarrhalis adhesin.

the m. catarrhalis strain bc <dig> protein mid, a hag ortholog, binds human immunoglobulin d on the bacterial surface, and mid residues 962– <dig> are responsible for this binding  <cit> . sequence analysis revealed that the region of o35e-hag encompassing aa 1113– <dig> is 83% identical to the bc5-mid igd binding domain . furthermore, hag mediates the binding of igd by m. catarrhalis strain o35e  <cit> . thus, the possibility that the igd-binding domain of o35e-hag is responsible for adherence to human epithelial cells and collagen was tested by removing aa 919– <dig>  from the already mutated hag protein  <dig> , yielding the construct  <dig>  . as shown in fig.  <dig>  deleting the predicted igd binding region of o35e-hag does not adversely affect attachment to epithelial cells  but completely abolishes binding to collagen . adherence to human cells is therefore specified by a region of o35e-hag distinct from that important for binding collagen, making these adhesive properties separable.

the adhesive properties of constructs  <dig>  and  <dig>  suggest that residues 385– <dig> contain the portion of o35e-hag mediating adherence to ncih <dig> cells and hmee cells. interestingly, previous sequence analysis by our laboratory indicated that aa 715– <dig> of o35e-hag are 73% identical to residues 764– <dig> of m. catarrhalis bc <dig> mid  <cit> . this is noteworthy because others showed that a purified and radioactively-labeled recombinant protein encompassing this particular portion of bc <dig> mid directly binds to a <dig> cells and erythrocytes  <cit> . to determine what role, if any, these aa have in adherence to ncih <dig> cells, hmee cells and collagen, most of the potential a549/erythrocyte binding site of o35e-hag  was removed from the already mutated hag protein  <dig> , yielding construct  <dig>  . as shown in columns n and h of fig.  <dig>  e. coli expressing this construct attached to both ncih <dig> lung cells and hmee cells at the same level as recombinant bacteria expressing the full length adhesin. however, these recombinant bacteria, like those expressing  <dig> , no longer bound to collagen . thus, the results are consistent with residues 385– <dig> encompassing a portion of o35e-hag that is crucial for adherence to ncih <dig> monolayers and hmee cells. this hypothesis is also supported by the results of quantitative attachment assays with construct  <dig> , which was obtained by deleting aa 385– <dig> from the adherence positive hag construct  <dig>  ; recombinant e. coli expressing construct  <dig>  no longer adhere to either ncih <dig> or hmee cells . the inability of constructs  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  to mediate the binding of recombinant bacteria to collagen suggests that a region of o35e-hag starting upstream of aa  <dig> and extending to at least residue  <dig> is important for adherence to this extracellular matrix protein .

discussion
previous reports established that hag and its ortholog mid play important roles in adherence of m. catarrhalis to middle ear epithelial cells and a <dig> pneumocytes  <cit> . disruption of hag/mid in several m. catarrhalis strains substantially decreased adherence to both cell types, while expression of hag in a heterologous e. coli background increased attachment to middle ear cells at least 17-fold. the results of the present study extend these findings and demonstrate that hag expression is also important for adherence to conjunctival  and lung mucoepidermoid  epithelial cells . these cell lines are relevant to pathogenesis by m. catarrhalis as this organism is a causative agent of conjunctivitis, otitis media and lung infections. furthermore, our data reveal that hag directly mediates binding to ncih <dig> monolayers . thus, hag is a key adherence factor for epithelial cells relevant to pathogenesis by the bacterium, making the protein an attractive target for anti-infective approaches.

hag/mid exhibit several properties of a good vaccine candidate. most m. catarrhalis isolates tested to date contain a hag/mid gene and express its product  <cit> . the protein also contains surface-exposed epitopes  <cit> , making it readily available for recognition by the immune system, and immunization with a peptide encompassing mid residues 713– <dig> increases clearance of m. catarrhalis from the lungs of infected mice  <cit> . our data demonstrating that hag plays a central role in m. catarrhalis adherence, a crucial step in pathogenesis by most infectious agents  <cit> , strengthen the hypothesis that this om protein has vaccinogenic potential. we believe that targeting functionally relevant regions of hag in a vaccine will interfere with colonization of susceptible individuals by m. catarrhalis. bacterial adhesins have already proven to be efficacious vaccine antigens. for example, immunization with the cell-binding domain of the h. influenzae adhesin hap elicits production of antibodies that reduce attachment to human epithelial cells and protect mice in a nasopharyngeal colonization model  <cit> . similarly, immunization with the adhesin fimh of uropathogenic e. coli is protective in animal models of infection  <cit> . furthermore, all vaccines licensed for use in the us against whooping cough contain the bordetella pertussis filamentous hemagglutinin adhesin fha  <cit> .

also consistent with the vaccinogenic potential of hag is the demonstration that saliva collected from healthy adults  <cit>  and children colonized with m. catarrhalis  <cit>  contain antibodies against hag. copd patients recovering from pulmonary exacerbations caused by this organism were also shown to have increased serum levels of anti-hag igg  <cit> . in addition, hag is a major target of new iga antibodies purified from the sputum of copd patients with m. catarrhalis infections who have successfully cleared the organism  <cit> . in fact, hag is the only om protein out of several tested  which elicited an iga response in all patients  <cit> . this protective immune response, however, appears to be strain specific as copd patients get reinfected with different m. catarrhalis isolates  <cit> . hag is a large protein  that exhibits interstrain variability   <cit> . these observations emphasize the need to identify the region of hag specifying the best vaccinogenic properties for protection against the majority of m. catarrhalis isolates. to achieve this, we sought to identify the region of hag specifying adhesive properties by deleting predicted structural domains of the protein. this approach has been successfully used to identify the cell-binding domains of other autotransporter adhesins such as y. enterocolitica yada  <cit>  and h. influenzae hap  <cit> .

the involvement of hag in adherence by m. catarrhalis is complex. while the protein itself is sufficient to directly mediate binding to middle ear  <cit>  and ncih <dig> lung cells , the exact role of hag in attachment to a <dig> and chang cells is not clear. as shown in fig. 1b, lack of hag expression in strains tta <dig> hag, v <dig> hag, mcghs <dig> hag and o12e.hag reduces binding to chang monolayers 70–90%, but hag expression does not confer on e. coli the ability to attach to these conjunctival cells . these results are similar to those previously reported by our laboratory, where it was discovered that hag expression is important for wt adherence of m. catarrhalis to a <dig> cells but that expression of the protein is not sufficient to mediate attachment of recombinant e. coli cells to these pneumocytes  <cit> . complicating matters is the demonstration that purified bc5-mid, specifically residues 713– <dig>  binds to a <dig> cells  <cit> . these observations suggest that post-translational modification of the protein and/or expression of a co-adhesin, neither of which occurs in the heterologous e. coli background, is necessary for hag-dependent binding to a <dig> and chang monolayers. interestingly, lack of ompcd  <cit>  or uspa <dig>  <cit>  substantially decreases adherence of m. catarrhalis to a <dig> and chang cells, respectively. these molecules may thus act in concert with hag during attachment to these epithelial cells. the lack of a suitable plasmid vector for m. catarrhalis currently precludes us from directly addressing these issues in the native genetic background. only three plasmids, namely pww102b  <cit> , pww <dig>  <cit>  and pemcjh <dig>  <cit> , have been described for use in m. catarrhalis. these vectors are not amenable for complemention of our mutants due to the incompatibility of antibioticr markers and replication in a restricted number of m. catarrhalis isolates. for these reasons, we focused our efforts on identifying region of o35e-hag important for directly mediating adherence to hmee and ncih <dig> cells, using e. coli as a host for our experiments.

the adhesive properties of constructs  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  imply that residues 71– <dig> and 746– <dig> of o35e-hag do not specify binding to either hmee or ncih <dig> monolayers . these results are particularly interesting in light of previous reports that the β-roll repeats of yada specify binding to both collagen and human epithelial cells  <cit> . a recent study also indicates that the β-roll repeats found in the n-terminus of the actinobacillus actinomycetemcomicans oca autotransporter adhesin emaa specify adhesive properties  <cit> . the ability of construct  <dig>  to confer on e. coli the ability to attach to ncih <dig> cells, hmee cells and collagen, however, demonstrates that the β-roll structures of o35e-hag are not required for adherence. although all mutated hag proteins conferring attachment to epithelial cells also have aa 1– <dig> and 1708– <dig> in common , it is unlikely that these residues are directly mediating adherence. this belief is based on previous sequence analysis of o35e-hag indicating that aa 1– <dig> correspond to a signal sequence and that the last  <dig> residues  specify a transporter domain anchoring the protein in the om  <cit> . furthermore, recombinant bacteria expressing the mutated hag proteins  <dig>  and  <dig> , both of which specify aa 1– <dig> as well as 1708– <dig> but lack most of residues 385– <dig>  do not bind to hmee or ncih <dig> cells . these observations support the hypothesis that aa 385– <dig> of o35e-hag contain a major epithelial cell binding determinant.

forsgren and colleagues previously reported that residues 764– <dig> of mid, which correspond to aa 715– <dig> of o35e-hag, encompass the part of the protein mediating adherence to a <dig> cells and erythrocytes  <cit> . our results demonstrate that the mutated hag construct  <dig> , lacking most of this region , binds to ncih <dig> and middle ear cells . in addition, e. coli carrying the plasmid pbbhs <dig> , which specifies the entire a <dig> binding domain , does not attach to ncih <dig> or hmee cells . these results suggest that the portion of hag important for adherence to middle ear and ncih <dig> cells is different from that specifying attachment to a <dig> pneumocytes. whether the mutated hag constructs  <dig>  or  <dig>  mediate adherence to a <dig> cells was not tested since we previously demonstrated that hag expression is not sufficient to confer recombinant bacteria with the ability to attach to this particular cell line. interestingly, the serum of copd patients recovering from m. catarrhalis infections contain elevated antibody titers against mid residues 367– <dig>  <cit> , which correspond to aa 355– <dig> of o35e-hag. these observations support the hypothesis that the ncih <dig> and hmee epithelial cell binding region of hag has immunogenic potential, which is a desirable characteristic of a vaccine candidate.

m. catarrhalis binds to extracellular matrix proteins including fibronectin  <cit> , vitronectin  <cit> , and laminin  <cit> ; to our knowledge, the organism has not previously been reported to bind to collagen. our data demonstrate that e. coli expressing the hag gene product of three m. catarrhalis wt isolates  gained the ability to attach to type iv collagen . m. catarrhalis isolates expressing hag, however, were found to bind poorly to collagen , at least when grown under the conditions we used. one possible explanation for these conflicting results is that m. catarrhalis cells express an additional surface molecule  that precludes hag-mediated binding to collagen. this hypothesis is supported by reports demonstrating that expression of certain surface structures can adversely affect the biological function of others. for instance, pearson and colleagues recently showed that hag interferes with uspa1-dependent biofilm development  <cit> . similarly, the expression of type  <dig> fimbriae prevents ag43-mediated autoaggregation of e. coli cells, even though ag <dig> is still expressed at wt levels on the bacterial surface  <cit> . other e. coli examples include capsular polysaccharides blocking the function of ag <dig>  <cit> , and the autoaggregation proteins tiba as well as aida-i functioning as surface antagonists of flagellar motility  <cit> . whether m. catarrhalis expresses a molecule inhibiting hag-dependent adherence to collagen remains to be determined. another possible explanation for these conflicting results is that hag is expressed at greater levels in e. coli compared to m. catarrhalis. the biological relevance of m. catarrhalis binding to collagen is currently unknown. the molecule is a major component of the extracellular matrix that supports most tissues and type iv collagen is found in the basal lamina, which is the layer on which the epithelium sits. hag-mediated binding to collagen may therefore facilitate adherence of m. catarrhalis to damaged tissues during infection.

CONCLUSIONS
hag expression is important for adherence to several human epithelial cells relevant to pathogenesis by m. catarrhalis, including middle ear, lung and conjunctival cells. this oca-family adhesin directly mediates binding to type iv collagen as well as middle ear and ncih <dig> lung cells, but its expression is not sufficient to confer recombinant bacteria with the ability to attach to chang conjunctival monolayers. the collagen and epithelial cell binding properties of hag are separable and residues 385– <dig> appear to specify the epithelial cell binding domain of the protein. this portion of hag is different from that proposed by other investigators to be crucial for attachment to a <dig> cells . furthermore, conserved structural features shown to specify the adhesive properties of the oca adhesin yada , are not important for adherence mediated by hag. these observations suggest that hag employs different mechanisms to confer adherence to epithelial cells and collagen.
