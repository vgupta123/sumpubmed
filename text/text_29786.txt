BACKGROUND
approximately two-thirds of the world’s freshwater is used to dilute wastewater discharges. the demand for freshwater is expected to rise by 70% by  <dig>  <cit>  driving an urgent need to understand the impacts of treated waste effluent discharges on aquatic ecosystems. wastewater treatment works  effluents contain tens of thousands of chemicals, including pharmaceuticals and natural steroid estrogens that are biologically active at low  exposure concentrations  <cit> . however, the long-term consequences of exposure to most of these chemicals on fish health and population sustainability are not known.

there is substantial evidence showing that experimental exposure of fish to wwtw effluents and the estrogens they contain can result in adverse health effects, including effects on reproductive development and breeding output. this has led to concerns that freshwater fish populations might also be affected with cascading consequences for freshwater ecosystems. feminization of male fish is widespread in stretches of rivers downstream of wwtw outfalls as demonstrated in studies using wild  <cit>  and caged  <cit>  fish. feminized phenotypes include the presence of vitellogenin, a female-specific protein in the blood of male fish  <cit>  and the intersex condition: the presence of oocytes and/or female reproductive ducts in otherwise male gonads  <cit> . feminization has been attributed to the presence of estrogens in effluents: estradiol  and estrone  from human excretion;  <dig> alpha-ethinylestradiol , a component of the female contraceptive pill  <cit> ; and a large number of other estrogenic chemicals from industrial and domestic effluents. wwtw effluents can also induce genotoxic effects  <cit> , alterations in immune function  <cit> , decreased reproductive output  <cit> , altered stress response  <cit>  and changes in reproductive behavior  <cit> .

concern about estrogens in rivers in the united kingdom drove a £40 m programme to evaluate the efficacy of various tertiary treatment processes in the removal of estrogens  <cit> . implementation of such processes will, however, incur considerable costs and a greater carbon footprint for wwtw  <cit> , emphasising the need to understand better the population-level consequences for exposure to estrogenic and other so-called endocrine disrupting chemicals .

a critical question is whether chronic exposure to estrogenic effluents negatively impacts the viability of wild fish populations, but this has been difficult to address experimentally as it requires controlled experiments extending over periods of several years. limited studies suggest that high concentrations of ee <dig>  in the aquatic environment could be a threat to the sustainability of fish populations. for example, a controlled exposure of an entire lake to ee <dig> in canada resulted in the collapse of the fathead minnow  population within three years  <cit> . likewise, long-term  laboratory exposures of a range of fish species have resulted in the absence of breeding males  <cit>  and a three-year exposure of roach  to an undiluted wwtw effluent in large tanks resulted in an all-female population  <cit> . it is not known, however, if this occurs in rivers contaminated by effluents. female fecundity can also be reduced through estrogen exposure, which can potentially reduce population growth rates  <cit> . although the exposure concentrations in these studies were high compared to those typically experienced by wild fish populations  <cit> , exposures to ee <dig> at concentrations below 1 ng/l during the period of sexual development, have been shown to result in feminized gonads in roach  <cit>  and decreased egg fertilization and female-skewed sex ratios in fathead minnows  <cit> . evidence from wild roach living in uk rivers has similarly shown that feminized fish  with large numbers of eggs in their gonads have impaired semen quality  <cit>  and severely  reduced reproductive success  <cit> .

while these studies suggest that exposure to high concentrations of effluent could threaten the viability of fish populations, aggregates of cyprinid fish, including roach, are often found in effluent contaminated rivers. however, numbers alone may provide a misleading assessment of population sustainability as these could be sink populations maintained by substantial immigration from less contaminated locations where successful reproduction still occurs. likewise, effective population sizes  – related to the breeding population of fish – may be decreased without necessarily impacting on population sizes  <cit> , as effluent exposure can affect the number of reproducing individuals and can skew reproductive success  <cit> . density-dependent growth and survival can also play an important role  <cit> , so a few reproducing individuals can potentially maintain large adult population sizes. indeed, studies in several species of marine fish with high fecundity have shown that ne can be several orders of magnitude smaller than census population sizes. one study found two populations of the exploited new zealand snapper  to have values of ne less than  <dig>  despite adult census population sizes in the millions  <cit> . similarly, a study of striped bass , a freshwater fish species, found cohorts to consist of a few, full sib families, despite an adult census size of over  <dig>   <cit> . critically, ne influences long-term sustainability as it determines the rate at which genetic diversity is lost from a population through genetic drift  <cit> . high genetic diversity increases the long-term potential for populations to adapt to changes in the environment and also acts to reduce the risk of inbreeding  <cit> . small ne, however, may act to increase the chances of losing some lethal or sub-lethal mutations through genetic purging.

understanding the impact of estrogenic effluents on the sustainability of fish populations is, therefore, paramount, but has been limited to date by the logistical challenges involved in undertaking long-term exposures to realistic effluent concentrations, and understanding the demographic history of wild fish populations at highly contaminated sites. in this study, we examine evidence for population impacts on wild roach , a fish species in which feminization is widespread, in southern england. southern england has some of the highest proportions of wwtw effluent in rivers known globally, and numerous weirs and locks which potentially confine fishes to heavily polluted stretches of river. we have used this system to evaluate whether stretches of river highly contaminated with estrogenic effluents have impaired breeding populations of roach. to do this we undertook analysis of population genetic structures of roach in the region using dna microsatellite analysis. microsatellite data were also used to calculate ne and estimate levels of gene flow to determine the extent to which these populations are maintained through immigration of fish from less contaminated stretches of river.

RESULTS
genetic diversity and genetic bottlenecks
a total of  <dig>  roach, constituting  <dig> samples  from  <dig> different geographic locations in england were genotyped . data for  <dig> microsatellite loci  revealed high genetic diversity in all  <dig> samples . allelic richness  ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , and expected heterozygosity  ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . nevertheless, significant differences in ar , f =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) and observed heterozygosity   =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) among samples were detected. roach sampled at two relatively unpolluted sites  exhibited comparatively low ar and leehyd’ <dig> exhibited comparatively relatively low ho . no significant differences in he were found. additionally, there was evidence for genetic bottlenecks at two relatively unpolluted sites sampled within the rivers arun  and lee , and at a polluted site in the lee  .

population genetic structure of roach in english rivers
we undertook an analysis of population genetic structure in order to examine the genetic similarity of roach between and within catchments. analysis of molecular variance  indicated the majority of variation was partitioned among individuals within river locations, with river location accounting for a small  <dig> %, but highly significant proportion of the genetic variation . average pairwise fst between roach samples from different catchments was  <dig>  and comparisons were consistently highly significant . the population tree  shows distinct clusters of samples in different catchments: the arun, the nene, the anglian blackwater and the trent, supported with moderate–high bootstrap values . samples from the arun and the nene also group in the principal component  and the structure analyses  demonstrating a distinct genetic identity of fish at these sites. utilising the method of evanno et al. <cit> , the inferred most likely number of genetically distinct clusters in the structure analysis was three, comprising: the arun, the two most upstream sample sites in the river lee, and all remaining sites genotyped. however, from visual examination of structure plots run with higher levels of k  other possible groups are apparent. we found no evidence that roach in the thames catchment constitute a distinct genetic group, as samples failed to group together in any analysis . this may reflect a true lack of genetic distinctiveness of roach in this catchment, but may also result from the limited ability of the microsatellite markers used to resolve population genetic structure at this level.

population genetic structure of roach within rivers and catchments
despite thames catchment roach appearing not to constitute a single genetic unit, distinct from roach in other regions, the study did find evidence for significant genetic structuring in roach populations within the thames catchment. this suggests the existence of local subpopulations exchanging a limited number of effective migrants  rather than panmixia . for example, average fst between samples in the thames catchment was  <dig> , only slightly lower than the average for between-catchment comparisons  for the study as a whole, while  <dig> of the  <dig> pairwise fst comparisons in the catchment were highly significant. there was a weak, but significant, relationship between genetic and geographic distance  within the catchment, indicating a tendency for individuals to produce offspring with fish from nearby populations rather than distant populations . additionally, the population tree  and pca analyses  showed groups comprising samples from neighbouring thames sites: three from the main thames; four from the kennet and its tributary ; samples from the stort and the lee; and samples from the wandle and mole. samples from the thames blackwater collected in the years  <dig> and  <dig>  clustered with very high bootstrap support  in the population tree . this indicates that this roach population is largely restricted to this stretch of river, which includes both moderately and highly polluted sites, and has no substantial uncontaminated upstream stretch .

despite the proximity of some populations in the pca and tree, we also found significant genetic differentiation between samples from some neighbouring stretches of the same river, sometimes occurring over small distances of separation , for example, within the upper lee , between the lee and the stort, between the blackwater and main thames, between the lambourn and the kennet and within the anglian blackwater. in other cases, despite the separation of sampling locations by in-river impoundments such as weirs, we found no significant genetic differentiation between sites, for example, within the stort, the main thames, the kennet, the arun, the nene and the trent. thus, patterns of within-river genetic structure differed between river stretches. for some other fish species analysis of genome-wide snp data has provided greater resolution in population structure than that achievable using microsatellite data  <cit> , and it is possible that some fine-scale genetic structure in the roach populations has not been detected with the microsatellites used in the current study.

relationship between exposure to estrogenic effluents and effective population size
estimates of ne calculated from the microsatellite data using the approximate bayesian computation method ), ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> for each sample, with higher precision for small ne estimates . we found no evidence for a correlation between ne and predicted e <dig> equivalents , a measure of total estrogenicity of the river water due to contamination by sewage effluent , f =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) or for an interaction between sample site and estrogen exposure  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) across the  <dig> sample sites where no recent restocking had occurred and had sufficient sample sizes for robust ne calculation. however, the 95% confidence intervals  for the model coefficient indicated ne could decrease by a maximum of  <dig> % for each incremental increase in exposure of 1 ng/l e2eq, or 65% at  <dig>  ng/l e2eq, equivalent to the most polluted river stretch included in this study. the inclusion of roach density as an additional covariate within the model also produced a non-significant result  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ), albeit for a reduced number of sites . similarly, there was no significant correlation between the other variables included in the statistical analyses  with ne. this analysis makes the assumption that immigration of fish from remote sites is limited and this is discussed below.

there was limited evidence for reduced variation in ne in roach sampled from more contaminated stretches of river compared to those sampled from less contaminated sites; all estimates above 6 ng/l e2eq were below  <dig>  whereas there was greater variation  where e2eq was below 6 ng/l . estimates of ne using other methods were of the same order of magnitude but had wider confidence intervals for each estimate; ne ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> and also showed no relationship with e2eq . temporal estimates of ne, calculated from allele frequency changes over several generations using the jorde and ryman method  <cit> , varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  but were available for too few locations to make meaningful comparisons . overall, the relatively small variations in ne observed in this study could not be explained by any of the environmental or other variables measured in this study.

population genetic structure within the river lee, a high effluent river
the average proportion of effluent in the upper lee downstream from harpenden and east hyde wwtws ranges from 28% to 70% in different stretches. significant genetic differentiation was detected between fish sampled from four of the five locations in this stretch of river , and between these samples and two from its tributary, the stort  shown in table  <dig>  the presence of numerous large weirs  likely confines fish to particular areas of this river; nonetheless, samples from the lee and the stort did cluster together in some analyses . a sample from the upstream, unpolluted sample site  grouped with two samples  from the most polluted river stretch immediately downstream . the next sample site downstream, leewhe, was distinct from these , indicating restricted movement of fish between leehyd and leewhe over at least three to five generations . analysis using the program ima <dig>  <cit>  suggested that there was less than one effective  migrant per generation between leehyd and leewhe in either direction, and about one migrant per generation from leewhe downstream to leesta . collectively, these data suggest that roach populations at leewhe and those downstream do not rely on migration from the uncontaminated stretch of this river. despite this, ne estimates for these polluted sites in the upper lee ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  compared to only  <dig>  for the upstream uncontaminated location, suggesting no substantial impact of the effluent on the effective population size of these roach.

discussion
in this study, analyses of population genetic structure via the analysis of dna microsatellite loci identified distinct subpopulations of roach in two tributaries of the thames, the rivers lee and the blackwater, that were largely restricted to high-effluent stretches of the rivers over multiple generations. this is despite evidence for widespread feminization of male fish in the studied rivers and previous evidence that feminization alters breeding capabilities  <cit> . both of these tributaries contain feminized fish  <cit> ), with predicted average exposure of between  <dig> and 9 ng/l e2eq. we also found no statistically robust evidence for a substantial impact of estrogenic sewage effluents on ne of roach. the possibility of a reduction in ne of up to 65% for roach living in the most polluted river stretches  could not be ruled out, due to the wide 95% confidence intervals associated with the statistical model. moreover, our analysis included relatively few samples from rivers in the highest risk category, largely because these sites are rare.

caveats
as with any modelling exercise, this analysis makes assumptions that may affect the interpretation of the results. one of these assumptions is that migration between sites with different pollution profiles is limited over two to three generations, the time frame likely to have the greatest influence on ne <cit> . this was ensured by selecting sites with physical obstructions between them. however, quantifying migration rates over this timescale was not always possible because all potential source populations could not be sampled and, in some cases, we found no significant genetic differentiation between roach at sites distant from one another. genetic differentiation can take many generations to manifest with low levels of migration  <cit> . histological data from the arun and the lee show that feminized gonads in roach were approximately 6-fold  and approximately  <dig> -fold  more prevalent in populations living in the stretches downstream of major wwtw inputs compared with those living upstream  <cit> . this demonstrates that migration in these rivers was indeed restricted to stretches delimited by physical barriers, despite no significant genetic differentiation observed between river stretches .

a second assumption is that no restocking of the rivers sampled had occurred or that the effect of restocking activities on ne was relatively minor. approximately  <dig>  hatchery-reared roach just over one-year-old  have been introduced into the thames catchment since 2000; broodstock for hatchery fish originate from the river trent. the influence of restocking activities on ne, however, is likely to be relatively minor, as the sites sampled in this study were separated by major physical barriers from sites where these introductions had occurred. moreover, introductions prior to  <dig> are unlikely to have had a large influence on ne as this is primarily affected by the size and variance in reproductive success of the parental generation, which would have spawned between  <dig> and  <dig> for most of the samples in this study. however, we cannot exclude some influence of introductions prior to  <dig> as some of the summary statistics used to calculate ne are known to be affected by demographic processes over a longer time period  <cit> . the effects of introductions on genetic diversity, the detection of bottlenecks and population structure are likely to be greater, as these factors are affected by demography over many generations. however, neither the success of the reintroduced fish nor the size of the roach population in the thames is currently known. in salmonids, restocking success is highly variable and has been attributed to local adaptation  <cit> . using our microsatellite dataset, 73% of  <dig> individual roach from a stretch of the wandle  assigned to the thames reporting regions. only 5%  assigned to the trent , which may be mis-assignments, as 5% also assigned to the arun, 10% to the anglian blackwater and 10% to the nene, from where no restocking had taken place. thus, the success of the re-introduced fish may be low, but this requires further investigation.

evidence for self-sustaining populations in effluent contaminated rivers
while this study does not exclude the possibility that estrogenic effluents reduce ne of fish populations, it suggests that roach populations can be self-sustaining despite exposure to estrogens over several generations. these findings are consistent with the fact that the prevalence of male fish with moderate to severely feminized gonads  is generally less than 10% in english rivers  <cit> . the reproductive competitiveness of fish with the more common mild-intersex condition is similar to those of fish without gonadal feminization  <cit> . in roach, the gonads of male fish exposed to estrogens become progressively feminized with age  <cit> , so gonadal feminization could theoretically increase ne by reducing the reproductive dominance of large older males in estrogen-contaminated rivers. while the effects on females are less well studied, female roach exposed to an undiluted effluent for three years in large tanks were able to breed, despite the fact that this exposure caused complete gonadal feminization of males  <cit> ; similarly, the majority of females collected from two effluent-polluted rivers examined in this study were also able to breed  <cit> .

population risks of long-term exposures to estrogenic effluents
the results of this study on wild roach populations seem to contrast with studies that have assessed population risk through long-term exposures to estrogens, where exposure to concentrations between  <dig> and 6 ng ee2/l  <cit>  or to a full-strength effluent  <cit>  resulted in all-female populations and/or reproductive failure. the apparent difference between the wild populations and those experiments designed to simulate ‘real world’ exposure, however, may be because the fish living in the effluent-contaminated rivers examined in this study have been exposed to a lower level of estrogen or because all of the estrogen is not bioavailable; organic pollutants can bind to particulates and dissolved organic matter  <cit> . the most contaminated river in this study has a mean proportion of effluent of approximately 70%, although the majority of contaminated english rivers average approximately 10% to 30%  <cit> . while ee <dig> has been measured up to approximately  <dig> to 8 ng/l in english wwtw effluents  <cit> , for the most part, they are lower  <cit> , and estrogen concentrations vary greatly over short periods. for instance, ee <dig> was detected in only  <dig> of  <dig> water samples from the lee, although occasionally reaching 4 ng/l  <cit> . considering the totality of estrogen content, the predicted average estrogenicity of the most contaminated site in this study is 12 ng/l e2eq and would be below 21 ng/l for 90% of the time. only 1% to 3% of  <dig>  individual river reaches in the uk receiving wwtw effluent were predicted to have average e2eq >10 ng/l, and, of these, many are ditches composed almost entirely of sewage effluent  <cit> . as e <dig> is approximately  <dig> times less potent than ee <dig> in inducing gonadal feminization in fish  <cit> , it is probable that average life-time exposure to estrogens in the wild does not currently reach the concentrations shown to cause sex-reversal and population collapse in controlled experimental exposures. green et al.  <cit>  recently predicted a doubling of estrogen exposure concentrations in some rivers with population growth and climate change by  <dig> suggesting an increased likelihood of population level effects of estrogenic effluents in the future, unless mitigated by substantial improvements in sewage treatment processes.

influences on the population genetic structure of roach
the population genetic structure of roach in southern england observed in this study may have been influenced by historical biogeography, migratory behaviour, human translocations and in-river barriers. roach can be highly mobile and can migrate over 10 km, particularly in the spawning period april to june, if migration is not obstructed  <cit> ; additionally, there is some evidence that roach show fidelity in migration and return to spawning sites they have used previously  <cit> . within the thames catchment, the observed population genetic structure likely results, at least in part, from the large number of physical barriers, such as weirs and locks ; these have been recognized as major factors restricting movement  of roach  <cit> . similarly, the importance of barriers in driving intra-catchment genetic variation is well documented in other fish species, for example, brown trout  <cit> . only obstructions in the main river thames and the kennet are equipped with fish passes and, although some passes can be used by roach  <cit> , the effectiveness of these passes in allowing fish movement has not been studied. as we identified significant genetic differentiation between roach from the kennet and the thames, despite being connected by fish passes, these passes may represent major physical separation barriers to this fish species.

CONCLUSIONS
despite the widespread feminization of male roach in effluent-contaminated rivers of southern england, using nuclear dna microsatellites we were able to identify some populations that have been confined to stretches of river with moderate to high exposure to estrogenic effluents over multiple generations. we also found no evidence of a correlation between the ne of roach populations and predicted exposure to estrogens, although because of the wide confidence intervals, a reduction in ne of up to 65% is still possible at the most contaminated sites.
