BACKGROUND
many proteins that control biological processes are initially synthesized as immature proproteins, which need to be proteolytically converted into functional end products. this proprotein conversion dictates the bioavailability of these dormant molecules. therefore the enzymes responsible of this event, proprotein convertases , are important regulatory factors. the primarily identified seven pcsks  are closely related and evolutionarily conserved subtilisin/kexin-like serine proteases that process their targets mainly in the secretory pathway, cell surface and endosomes . the general pcsk target sequence typically encompasses a series of basic amino acids lysine and/or arginine; -n-↓, where n is  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> and x is any amino acid. more recently identified and distantly related pcsk family members mbtps <dig> and pcsk <dig> do not cleave at basic amino acids. instead, mbtps <dig> targets the consensus motif -x--x↓, and pcsk <dig> has only autocatalytic cleavage activity on its prosegment sequence vfaq152↓.

understanding the determinants of pcsk target specificity is currently incomplete; convertases have shown a variable degree of redundancy in target selection in in vitro experiments, especially in over-expression settings  <cit> . importantly, however, the phenotypes of pcsk deficient animals and patients with genetic mutations that result in abolished or enhanced pcsk activity show compellingly that most, if not all, family members also have specific target proteins  <cit> . one approach to gain insights into the specificity prerequisites is to model and compare the structures of the pcsk enzymes. previous results suggest that all human pcsks share a remarkably similar structure of the substrate binding groove and there are only subtle differences in the number of charged residues close to the substrate binding region  <cit> .

additional clues for identification of physiological pcsk - substrate pairs come from experiments that show a positive expression correlation between pcsk and its substrate in cell. for example, furin is co-expressed with its target molecule vegf-c in head and neck cancer  <cit> , and some targets, like tgfβ- <dig>  are even known to create a feed-forward mechanism by enhancing the expression of their converting enzyme   <cit> . an explanation for the coordinated expression is often the common transcription factors that regulate the expression of both pcsk and a target molecule  <cit> . however, whether this phenomenon is universal for all pcsks and indicative of biological substrate specificity is currently not known.

in order to find new pcsk - target molecule pairs we have here analyzed the genome-wide expression correlation for all human genes and pcsk enzymes in a very large number of samples. our results also show that with notable exception of pcsk <dig> and pcsk <dig> the genes that are strongly co-regulated with a certain pcsk are often putative target molecules for these enzymes. we found also that pcsks display a highly variable number of unique and shared target genes, and that they also cluster differently with regard how many genes show a strong expression correlation. we finally validate our approach in biochemical experiments and identify pappa <dig> and adamts <dig> as novel furin target molecules.

RESULTS
the crystal structures for mouse furin, bacterial subtilisin and yeast kexin have been previously determined using x-ray crystallography  <cit> . we used the mouse furin structure as a template to survey the conservation of enzymatically active cleft/pocket of all the pcsk homologues in different genomes . we found the catalytic cleft, especially the residues that are in contact with the p1-p <dig> sites of the substrate, to be highly conserved in all pcsks over different genomes. our data further corroborate the remarkable conservation of the catalytically active cleft of the pcsk enzymes and suggest that the pcsk substrate specificity is likely not solely explained by the structural features of the active site  <cit> .

expression correlation
meta-analyses of public microarray data sources offer insights into the genome-wide gene expression in health and disease  <cit> . genesapiens is a comprehensive reference database of the human transcriptome that integrates large quantities of human expression data into a unified format  <cit> . using genesapiens we first arranged the whole human transcriptome  according to expression similarity with pcsk genes in all healthy tissues . the average correlation between pcsks and all other genes was close to zero . the 5%  of both most positively  and negatively  correlating genes were chosen for further analysis.

marked differences were observed in the magnitude of correlation amongst the top 5% genes. average correlations fell into two distinct categories: pcsk <dig>  pcsk <dig> and pcsk <dig> cluster together with significantly higher average correlations  than furin , pcsk <dig> , pcsk <dig>  and pcsk <dig> . pcsk <dig> stands out from all the other pcsks with  <dig> genes with an extreme high genome-wide expression correlation value of > <dig>  . in contrast, no such high correlations were observed for furin, pcsk <dig>  pcsk <dig> or pcsk <dig>  whereas pcsk <dig> and pcsk <dig> had only a few genes with equally high correlation . the genes that had the strongest negative expression correlation with pcsks  showed less variation in their magnitude of correlation .

finally, we explored the strength of the expression correlation between the pcsk genes. our data show that apart from pcsk <dig> and pcsk <dig> enzymes, which are chiefly present in the neuroendocrine tissues, no other pcsk-pcsk pair ranks within either top or bottom 5% in the analyses over the whole spectrum of tissues . it is noteworthy, however, that when pcsk pairs were analyzed in a tissue specific setting other strong correlations can be observed. for example, furin and pcsk <dig> show highly significant correlation in blood myeloid cells . tissue specific expression correlation data for all pcsk pairs is shown in additional file  <dig> 

identification of putative pcsk targets
the scheme that pcsk enzymes are co-expressed with their target molecules in vivo is supported by experimental evidence where immature growth factors are shown to be co-expressed and even induce the expression of their converting enzyme  <cit> . we wanted to explore whether putative pcsk target molecules are generally enriched in the genes that are coordinately expressed with pcsk enzymes. to this end, we employed a previously published, artificial neural networks based method  to survey pcsk target sequences in the most positively and negatively co-expressed genes. in addition, since pcsk mostly process their target proteins in the secretory pathway, the presence of signal peptide sequence predicted using the signalp algorithm integrated in prop  <dig>  was used as an additional inclusion criterion for putative targets  <cit> .

our analysis show that with the exception of pcsk <dig> and pcsk <dig> the top 5% of positively correlating gene pools encompasses a significant enrichment of putative target genes when compared with the bottom 5% correlates . for furin we used both "general pc" network, which is based on the experimental crystal structures in swiss-prot protein database and experiment-based "furin specific" target prediction network; both analyses showed strong enrichment of putative targets in highly positively correlating genes. interestingly, pcsk <dig>  the only family member with no reported knock-out mouse phenotype or specific target genes  <cit> , showed no significant difference in the number of putative target genes in top 5% versus bottom 5% correlates . this finding may either further suggest redundancy for pcsk <dig> function in biology or be a sign of more limited number of target molecules. pcsk <dig> in part showed an outstanding number of putative target molecules amongst the negatively correlating genes. this is an intriguing phenomenon and may offer insights into the biological characteristics of this enzyme. for example, one could envision that the pcsk <dig> target mrna translation may become repressed if mature protein is expressed in abundance. this could lead to lack of target enrichment in the positively correlating gene pool. we tested this hypothesis by exploring how an experimentally identified and bottom 5% target protein bace <dig>  <cit>  affects the pcsk <dig> expression in 293e cells. in these experiments transient overexpression of bace <dig> did not cause any alterations in the pcsk mrna expression levels . this negative result could, in theory, imply that the target induced pcsk <dig> repression is either tissue or target dependent, or that pcsk <dig> downregulation requires a sustained expression of its target proteins.

genes with pcsk cleavage site and signal peptide accumulate in top 5% correlating genes

pcsk enzymes have displayed a significant level of redundancy between family members in vitro  <cit> . however, the phenotypes of pcsk knockout animals and patients with either gain or loss-of-function mutations in pcsk genes argue for target specificity and need for identification of specific enzyme-substrate pairs  <cit> . to gain insights into the pcsk substrate specificity we first analyzed the degree of shared putative target proteins identified in expression-correlation analysis. table  <dig> lists the fractions of common putative targets for each pcsk enzyme, and extensive differences in sharing the co-expressed targets can be observed. for example, pcsk <dig> and pcsk <dig> form a unique convertase pair because they share a vast majority  of their putative target molecules. strikingly, pcsk <dig>  the enzyme that prefers negative rather than positive expression correlation with its putative targets shares few genes with other pcsk enzymes. this finding underscores the dissimilar behavior of this enzyme in these expression correlation analyses.

intriguingly, the previously published sequence-based pcsk comparisons resulted in nearly identical order of similarity as did our shared putative target analysis presented in table  <dig> <cit> . the only exception was pcsk <dig>  which is the structurally least similar enzyme with furin. in our analyses it has the second highest number of identical putative targets with furin. the substrate sharing between these two enzymes is supported by previous experimental data and a likely explanation for the observed biological redundancy of pcsk <dig>  <cit> .

to further dissect the specificity-redundancy issue we classified the identified target molecules according to a calculated 'uniqueness value' . first, the protease targets were sorted in descending order based on the correlation values with a specific pcsk gene and ordinals were recorded. then, the same was done ascending, one by one, for all the other pcsk genes. finally, the ordinal numbers for each of the correlating putative targets were summed up. consequently, lower value of the summed ordinals predicts more unique pcsk - target pair. in other words, this 'uniqueness value' assorts the likelihood by which a pcsk enzyme is coordinately and specifically expressed with a target molecule and can therefore offer insights into the biological function and degree of substrate redundancy of these enzymes.

in addition to the direct modulation by transcription activators and repressors expression of a gene can also be dictated at epigenetic level. clustering of the pcsk target genes in chromosomes might thus imply a coordinated, genome-structure manner of regulation. to test whether such clusters exist we performed a clustering analysis of the putative pcsk target genes. intriguingly, marked differences could be observed; the putative targets for the pcsk <dig> and pcsk <dig> form several chromosomal clusters , whereas for example there was no chromosomal clustering of the pcsk <dig> target genes . this could suggest that some of the pcsk enzymes regulate the expression of their targets by participating in the epigenetic modulation while others prefer a direct transcription factor based induction. obviously, experimental evidence is required to test this hypothesis.

exploring the putative substrates beyond the pcsk consensus sequence
the minimal pcsk target sequence contains basic amino acids arginine and lysine, which are critical for the substrate to bind into the negatively charged enzymatically active cleft in the pcsk enzymes. the flanking regions around the minimal consensus sequence in the pcsk targets are less well examined. the amino acid compositions around the recognition sequences were first visualized using multidisp server . we focused on twenty amino acid residues close to the putative pcsk cleavage site  to see if any common patterns can be identified for a specific pcsk enzyme. as expected, the predicted target sequences for all pcsks clearly favored either arginine or lysine at the p <dig> and p <dig>  and p <dig>  when the targets of a pcsk were explored individually many amino acid residues with only subtle preferences could be seen at other positions. to perform a systematic analysis of the preferred/unfavored residues we then calculated the frequency difference from a mean for each amino acid at sites p10-p10' using the amino acid frequency tables from multidisp .

our analysis showed minor differences in the target alignment segment, where a consensus sequence of rxr is favored. putative targets of pcsk <dig> have a slight enrichment of arginine in the p <dig>  this might be explained by the pcsk <dig> β8-β <dig> loop having a glycine aligning the p <dig> site instead of the glutamate in pcsk1/4/5/ <dig> or the phenylalanine in pcsk <dig>  small glycine residue might allow more space for the bulky arginine side chain. in addition, pcsk <dig>  which showed putative target enrichment in the bottom 5% correlating genes, seem to have a stronger preference for lysine at this site when compared to other pcsks. interestingly, when the inversely expressed putative targets from the negatively correlating genes for pcsk <dig> were analyzed we found a strong preference for arginine at p <dig> site . pcsk <dig> appears to allow negative charged residues at the p <dig> site, which cannot be explained in the electrostatics of the pcsk <dig> residues interacting with the p <dig>  just outside the substrate alignment segment, at the p <dig>  acidic residues are preferred in all groups of putative targets, except for pcsk <dig>  it is also noteworthy that the putative targets of pcsk <dig> have leucines enriched at sites p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>  the hydrophobic nature of leucine would suggest higher extent of hydrophobic interactions between pcsk <dig> and target sequences in contrast to other pcsks.

we did not find strong patterns of favored amino acids for the sites p1'-p10' that would explain substrate specificity of the pcsks. however, position p5' was found to be quite variable and to slightly favor acidic residues, with the exception of pcsk <dig>  glutamine and alanine were found slightly enriched in the p7' position in pcsk <dig>  these enriched residue types at certain positions could hint at sequence-specific substrate recognition, but additional studies are needed to prove their contribution to the biological function.

biochemical identification of pappa <dig> and adamts <dig> as novel furin substrates
as previously pointed out the coordinated expression of pcsk and its substrates is supported by scattered experimental evidence. in addition, a previous report has convincingly shown the validity of prop prediction in selecting pcsk targets in furin deficient mouse liver in vivo  <cit> . these data show that prop can predict the physiological pcsk processed proteins fairly accurately, but also that the mainly co-expression experiment data based furin prediction algorithm cannot discriminate the physiological furin specific target molecules from general pcsk targets. our genome-wide analysis identified several previously published targets for the pcsk enzymes, for example, the list of putative furin target molecules includes matrix metalloproteinases , growth factors , and cytokines  that have been previously been identified as pcsk targets  <cit> . notably, the list lacks a physiological furin target tgfβ <dig>  which shows a highly coordinated expression with furin in the tissues like blood myeloid and lymphoid cells   <cit> . when exploring the putative target list of pcsk <dig> and pcsk <dig> enzymes, which have a more restricted expression pattern than furin, we noted that several biological targets, such as prosaas  and prosomatostatin , can be identified. therefore, our approach seems to work particularly efficiently when both pcsk and its substrate have generally restricted expression. in contrast, genome-wide approach may fall short in identifying tissue specific substrates for widely expressed pcsk enzymes.

we validated our approach biochemically by identifying novel pcsk target genes on our lists. we chose to look for novel furin processed molecules from both general pcsk and "furin specific" target lists. we selected two highly correlating genes with a human-mouse conserved pcsk target sequence adamts <dig>  and pappa <dig> , which have not previously been experimentally shown to be processed by furin. further, we have previously shown that in furin knock-out t cells adamts <dig> is down-regulated, which is in keeping with our theory that the pcsk target molecules are coordinately regulated with their converting enzyme  <cit> . in figure 5a, we blotted for endogenous adamts <dig> molecule in wild-type and furin knock-out cd4+ t cells with an antibody that specifically recognizes the catalytic domain of adamts <dig>  our results show that the  <dig> kda band that represents the processed adamts <dig> molecule is clearly reduced in furin knock-out samples . furthermore, in figure 5b we show that pappa <dig>  which contains putative pcsk target sites in its n-terminus is only processed if furin cdna is co-expressed with the n-terminal part of pappa <dig>  the mutation of the putative furin target sequences in pappa <dig> makes it resistant for furin's proteolytic activity. these results unequivocally show that expression correlation analysis combined with pcsk target site prediction can be used to identify novel target molecules for the pcsk enzymes.

finally, to test whether the enrichment of certain amino acids around the cleavage site would change the target preferences for pcsks we mutated arginines at p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> positions of pappa <dig> into pcsk7-favored leucines . in these overexpression experiments wild-type n-terminus of pappa <dig> was processed by pcks <dig> to comparable extent with furin, a finding that underscores again the limitations of this approach in identifying specific substrates. however, pappa <dig> construct that harbors the favored leucines  was much more potently processed by pcsk <dig> when compared with wild-type pappa <dig>  this result confirms that the abovementioned exploration of the cleavage site flanking sequences may indeed give insights to the substrate preferences of a pcsk. however, true in vivo identification of such critical amino acids would require an analysis using for example knock-in mice or mutant patient cell lines.

CONCLUSIONS
the biological significance of the pcsk enzymes is indisputable and interfering with their activity holds promise for future therapies in diseases ranging from atherosclerosis to cancers and infections. therefore, understanding the determinants of the substrate specificity of pcsks enzymes is of utmost importance. traditional biochemical experiments where a pcsk is co-expressed in vitro with its putative target molecule have certainly improved our understanding on the pcsk function, but can also lead to misinterpretation on the biological role of a pcsk. our data presented herein shows that most pcsk enzymes are coordinately expressed with their putative target proteins. exploring this phenomenon can complement the in vitro experiments and can also offer insights into the true biological function of these enzymes in health and disease.
