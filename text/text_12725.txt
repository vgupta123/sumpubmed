BACKGROUND
pemphigus vulgaris  is characterized by the loss of normal epithelial cell-to-cell adhesion leading to blistering which may involve the mucous membranes, non-mucosal cutaneous surfaces, or both  <cit> . pemphigus autoantibodies  are mainly directed against the desmosomal glycoproteins desmoglein  <dig>  and desmoglein  <dig> , members of the cadherin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules  <cit> .

clinical evolution of disease expression is common in pv  <cit> . in early disease, a majority of pv patients develop autoantibodies to dsg <dig> coincident with mucosal blisters. in later stages, significant proportions of patients develop additional lesions on non-mucosal cutaneous sites and exhibit non-cross-reactive immunity to both dsg <dig> and dsg <dig>  <cit> .

two immunologic phenomenon termed "antigen mimicry"  <cit>  and "epitope spreading"  <cit>  have been proposed as possible pathogenic mechanisms responsible for the shift in autoreactive lymphocyte  profile from dsg3+/dsg1- to dsg3+/dsg1+. antigen mimicry can be defined as the generation of lymphocyte  reactivity towards a protein due to its close structural similarity to unique exogenous antigens, or new determinants that have been generated endogenously  <cit> . epitope spreading in the context of autoimmunity refers to the development of epitope-specific immune responses that are distinct from and non-cross-reactive with disease-inducing epitopes on the same  protein secondary to the release of such a self-protein during an autoimmune response  <cit> .

a close relationship between antigen mimicry and epitope spreading exists, with epitope spreading usually occurring after an initial episode of antigen mimicry  <cit> . exogenous and endogenous antigens that may trigger cross-reactivity with self-proteins have not yet been defined in pemphigus  <cit> . while the modulation of autoantibody reactivities in the transformation of one disease subform into another has been actively explored  <cit> , the role of t-cells underlying the evolution of autoreactive processes and epitope spreading remains poorly understood. to date, limited studies on t-cell specificities within pv have been reported  <cit> . the reported hla associations with disease may serve to provide the genetic link that drives the evolving autoimmune responses in pemphigus. pv is known to be strongly associated with the hla-dr allele drb1* <dig>  <cit> ; it is present in more than 90% of ashkenazi patients  <cit> . the drb1* <dig> allele is also common in other ethic backgrounds, including patients from france  <cit> , italy  <cit> , spain  <cit> , argentina  <cit>  and iran  <cit> .

we have previously investigated the docking potentials of dsg <dig> peptides to drb1* <dig> using a hybrid approach that integrates the strength of monte carlo simulations and homology modeling  <cit> . consistent with experimental evidence  <cit> , computational simulations reveal that a potentially large number of t-cell epitopes may be relevant in the pathogenesis of pv  <cit> . in the current study, we have extended our analysis to the dsg <dig> glycoprotein and applied a new scoring scheme for identification of immunological  hotspots within both dsg <dig> and dsg <dig> self-antigens. in silico mapping of the t-cell epitope repertoires within dsg <dig> and dsg <dig> suggests that similar peptides from both pv target antigens may be involved in disease progression and the evolution in autoreactive lymphocyte reactivity during the course of disease from one clinical subtype to another .

RESULTS
comparison of dsg <dig> and dsg <dig> extracellular domains
the dsg <dig> extracellular domain  has an extensive surface area of  <dig> Å  <dig>  this surface area is ~3% larger than the dsg <dig> ecd atomic accessible surface . the general folds of dsg <dig> and dsg <dig> ecds are similar . in particular, the ecd <dig>  ecd <dig> and ecd <dig> of dsg <dig> and dsg <dig> are well conserved with cα r.m.s.d. of  <dig>  Å,  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å, respectively. the main differences between dsg <dig> and dsg <dig> ecds lie in ecd <dig>  and ecd <dig> . in ecd <dig>  the most obvious difference between the structures involve the loop 411– <dig> of dsg <dig> and loop 405– <dig> of dsg <dig>  the backbone of gln <dig>  ala <dig> and ile <dig> in dsg <dig> are intercalated more deeply into the ecd <dig> interface than the corresponding residues in dsg <dig>  in ecd <dig>  the loop 468– <dig> curled upward toward dsg <dig>  with differences of up to  <dig>  Å between the corresponding positions in dsg <dig> . it appears that these regions may not contain high concentration of t-cell epitopes and do not contribute directly to the differences in t-cell specificities of the two pv target antigens . nonetheless, these structural differences are solvent exposed and may interact with pemphigus autoab.

dsg <dig> and dsg <dig> share common immunological hotspots
the locations of dsg <dig> and dsg <dig> immunological hotspots are highly conserved across the ecd, tm and intracellular domain , despite limited sequence identity . there are substantial overlaps between predicted and known immunological  hotspots  at the threshold - <dig> kj/mol . at this threshold, the number of predicted dsg <dig> hotspots are ten . among these, one spans the signal peptide , propeptide  and the ecd; six are present in the ecd; one extends across the ecd, tm and icd; while two hotspots are predicted to exist in the icd . similarly, nine hotspots were predicted for dsg <dig> , all of which overlap with those from dsg <dig> . collectively, these results suggest that the potential t-cell epitope repertoire encoded in dsg <dig> and dsg <dig> is substantially overlapping, and may help to explain the molecular basis underlying the observed inter-molecular spreading from dsg <dig> to dsg <dig> targets during the course of pv.

effects of binding registers in peptide selection
we investigated the effect of multiple contact regions or binding registers in dsg <dig> peptides specific to drb1* <dig>  <cit> . among  <dig> dsg <dig> peptide sequences ,  <dig> were predicted high-affinity binders with 77% containing two or more registers that can be docked into the binding groove of drb1* <dig>  a similar number of high-affinity binders are predicted to exist within the dsg <dig> glycoprotein, with analogous distribution of binding registers as illustrated in figure  <dig>  of  <dig> dsg <dig> peptides,  <dig> were predicted high-affinity binders with  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  peptides possessing two, three, four, five and six registers, respectively.

redundancy profiles of predicted binding peptides
the predicted dsg <dig> high-affinity binding sequences were examined for their similarity with the dsg <dig> proteome. each dsg <dig>  sequence was used to probe the entire dsg <dig> proteome for the highest identity dsg <dig>  peptide with the minimal number of substitutions. figure  <dig> details the degree of conservation of dsg <dig> predicted high-affinity binders with dsg <dig> sequences. all predicted dsg <dig> and dsg <dig>  binding peptides share at least four common residues along their primary sequences. it has been reported that pv and pf autoabs can cross-react with dsg <dig> and dsg <dig> peptides with 75% identity  <cit> . sequence alignment showed that 18%  of these peptides are highly conserved with at least 75% sequence identity. in this context, two peptides dsg158– <dig> cregednskrnpiak and dsg159– <dig> regednskrnpiaki near the n-terminus of ecd <dig> appear to be of particular interest, since they are fully conserved within the dsg <dig> proteome and may represent the most likely antigenic link between self-directed responses to two distinct autoantigens . a subset of patients with pv has been shown to have t cell reactivity to both dsg <dig> and dsg <dig>  <cit> . however, defined dsg <dig> epitopes have not yet been determined.

CONCLUSIONS
although clinical evolution of disease expression is common in pv  <cit> , our understanding of how t-cells are involved in the underlying autoreactive processes remains poor. collectively, the results of this study provide interesting new insights into the possible mechanism of disease progression. our data suggests that similar peptides from the two known pv autoantigenic targets may bind to drb1* <dig> and allow for intermolecular epitope spreading that lead to distinct morphological categories of pv – mucosal lesions only vs. mucocutaneous disease. nonetheless, many other factors exist, such as igg-activated intracellular signalling events  <cit> , which may play a critical role in the complex disease mechanism and should also be explored. recently, lucchese and coworkers  <cit>  discovered an immunodominant dsg <dig> t-cell epitope dsg349– <dig> rewvkfakpcre that is highly reactive with both pv and pf sera, with 75% identity to dsg149– <dig> rewikfaaacre. in this context, our current approach of epitope mapping may prove useful in facilitating the systematic discovery of peptides that cross-react with both pv and pf autoreactive t-cells and serve as targets for potential therapeutic approaches that are efficient in both diseases. further studies are necessary to determine the proportion of immunogenic epitopes that are capable of stimulating autoreactive lymphocytes from both pemphigus subtypes.
