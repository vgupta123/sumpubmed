BACKGROUND
potato late blight, a disease caused by the oomycete pathogen phytophthora infestans, is one of the world's most devastating crop diseases. world-wide losses due to late blight exceed several billion dollars annually  <cit> . most of the potato cultivars currently grown in the united states are highly susceptible to late blight and control of this disease relies almost exclusively on fungicide applications. the most effective and environmentally sound way for controlling late blight is to incorporate natural resistance into potato cultivars. the pedigrees of many potato cultivars currently used in different countries include late blight resistant germplasm derived from solanum demissum, solanum andigena, and other wild species. however, most of the resistance derived from these wild species is controlled by single dominant resistance genes . these r genes are only effective in preventing the development of late blight if the invading p. infestans race contains the corresponding avirulence genes. this r gene-mediated resistance is often short-lived and is rapidly overcome by new races of the late blight pathogen.

solanum bulbocastanum  is a diploid species that has adapted in the same environment as the late blight pathogen. this wild species was characterized as possessing durable resistance against p. infestans, even under high disease pressure  <cit> . two resistance genes, rb  and rpi-blb <dig>  have been cloned from s. bulbocastanum  <cit> . both genes confer broad-spectrum resistance against a wide range of known p. infestans races. transgenic potato lines containing a single rb gene showed a high-level resistance in the toluca valley, mexico, where the potato fields are naturally intensively infested with the most diversified p. infestans populations  <cit> . most interestingly, transgenic rb plants did not show total immunity to late blight, but instead showed a marked delay in both onset of symptoms and development of lesions. such rate-limiting resistance may put less selection pressure on the p. infestans populations and protect the durability of this resistance gene. the rb gene therefore provides an excellent model to study the mechanism of broad-spectrum and rate-limiting disease resistances. an understanding of the underlying mechanism of this type of resistance is important for developing strategies to breed durable and sustainable disease resistance.

several genes have been implicated in the regulation of r gene function. of these genes, rar <dig> and sgt <dig> are among the most extensively studied genes. the rar <dig>  gene was first identified for its essential role in the function of a subset of mla genes that confer resistance to barley powdery mildew  <cit> . the rar <dig> protein contains two highly similar but distinct cysteine- and histidine-rich  zn2+-binding domains and was proposed to play a role in stabilizing r proteins in a confirmation that is implicated in receiving pathogen signals  <cit> . the sgt <dig> gene  is an essential gene with multiple functions in yeast. sgt <dig> protein was initially identified as a rar1-interacting partner in a yeast two-hybrid screen  <cit> . sgt <dig> may play a role in r protein accumulation  <cit> . rar <dig> and sgt <dig> genes are required in various r-gene mediated resistance against viral, bacterial, oomycete or fungal pathogens  <cit> . however, none of the previously studied r genes showed a race-non-specific and rate-limiting resistance phenotype as the rb gene. in addition, the role the rar <dig> and sgt <dig> genes are not universal and these genes are not essential for resistance involving some r genes  <cit> .

besides the two broad-spectrum resistance genes rb and rpi-blb <dig>  several race-specific late blight resistance genes have also been cloned  <cit> . numerous late blight resistance genes have recently been mapped in various potato species or populations  <cit> . however, there is almost no information available about the resistance pathways mediated by any of these genes. as an initial effort to understand the rb-mediated late blight resistance pathway, we silenced the rar <dig> and sgt <dig> genes using an rnai-based approach in a potato line containing the rb gene. we demonstrated that sgt <dig>  but not rar <dig>  is essential for the rb-mediated broad-spectrum resistance to potato late blight.

RESULTS
identification of the potato rar <dig> and sgt <dig> genes
a search of the institute for genomic research  potato database  <cit>  using a sequence from the tobacco rar <dig> gene  identified a potato est, tc <dig> , which showed 96% sequence similarity to the tobacco and tomato rar <dig> transcripts. similarly, a search using a sequence from the tomato sgt <dig> gene  identified a potato est, tc <dig> , which showed 98% sequence similarity to the tobacco and tomato sgt <dig> genes and 90% sequence similarity to the arabidopsis thaliana sgt1b gene. since the full-length cdnas for the a. thaliana rar <dig> and sgt1b genes are  <dig> and  <dig> bp, respectively  <cit> , the identified potato ests almost cover each of the complete potato genes. southern blot hybridization was performed to determine the copy numbers of the rar <dig> and sgt <dig> genes in the potato genome. genomic dna was isolated from potato clone k <dig>  which contains the rb gene introgressed from s. bulbocastanum, and was hybridized with the potato rar <dig> and sgt <dig> gene probes. the southern hybridization results showed that the haploid potato genome contains only one copy of the rar <dig> gene and two copies of the sgt <dig> gene , which agree with a similar conclusion reported by pajerowska et al. .

rnai-based silencing of the potato rar <dig> and sgt <dig> genes
we developed rnai constructs for the potato rar <dig> and sgt <dig> genes. the rar <dig> silencing construct contained a 474-bp fragment covering the chord ii domain. the sgt <dig> construct contained a 481-bp fragment that targets the p23/cs domain . these constructs were used for agrobacterium-mediated transformation of the potato line k <dig>  we obtained  <dig> and  <dig> independent transgenic lines for the rar <dig> and sgt <dig> genes, respectively.

the expression of the rar <dig> and sgt <dig> genes in the transgenic lines was analyzed by northern blot hybridization using the rar <dig>  and sgt <dig>  genes as probes. a significant reduction of the rar <dig> transcripts was observed in  <dig> of the  <dig> rar1-rnai transgenic lines analyzed . sgt <dig> transcript reduction was also observed in  <dig> of the  <dig> sgt1-rnai lines . three rar1-rnai lines and one sgt1-rnai line showed no detectable northern hybridization signals after exposure for over one month using intensifying screens . only these four lines were used in the late blight resistance evaluation. we observed no distinguishable morphological features associated with rnai-induced silencing of the rar <dig> and sgt <dig> genes in these transgenic lines.

late blight resistance evaluation of the rar1- and sgt1-silenced potato lines
we evaluated the late blight resistance of the rar1- and sgt1-silenced lines together with several controls that either contain or do not contain the rb gene, including transformed but not silenced rar1-rnai and sgt1-rnai lines . triplicates of each line were used in each of two independent inoculation experiments. all variation within replicates and experiments were taken into account in determining resistance scores. the average score of the late blight infection on the rar1-silenced plants was  <dig>   after  <dig> days post inoculation  and  <dig>   after  <dig> dpi, which represents ~13% and 18% foliage infection, respectively . the untransformed k <dig> plants and the non-silenced rar1-rnai line showed an average score of  <dig>  , representing less than 10% infection. all susceptible controls showed an average score of  <dig>  , representing ~81% infection. anova showed that there was a significant difference in mean resistance scores among the tested plants  after seven days. fisher's least significant difference  test as a comparison of resistance score means revealed no significant differences between the rar1-silenced plants and other resistant controls but revealed significant differences with the susceptible control, katahdin. these results show that the rb-mediated resistance was not affected in the rar <dig> silenced lines.

the sgt1-silenced plants showed an average late blight infection of  <dig>   after  <dig> dpi and  <dig>   after  <dig> dpi, representing ~70% and ~73% infection, respectively . significant differences among the mean resistance scores were observed among the tested plants starting from day seven using anova with p-val =  <dig> e- <dig>  fisher's lsd test revealed that the sgt1-silenced plant had a significantly different resistance score compared to the resistant control  and non-silenced sgt <dig> plants. these results suggested that silencing of the sgt <dig> gene compromised the rb-mediated late blight resistance.

the late blight resistance of the rar1- and sgt1-silenced lines were also evaluated using the gfp-tagged p. infestans isolate 208m <dig>  <cit> . the phytophthora growth was quantified by counting the fluorescing sporangia within each area; more p. infestans growth is indicated by larger counts. one and three days after inoculation, no significant differences were observed between the sporangial counts on the silenced and non-silenced controls. six days after inoculation, however, there were significant differences among the sporangial counts of the tested plants  based on a one-way anova with unequal variance . fisher's lsd, using an alpha of  <dig> , indicated that the sgt1-silenced plant had significantly more p. infestans growth, as indicated by sporangial count, than the k <dig> control, the transgenic but not silenced rar1-rnai and sgt1-rnai lines and the rar1-silenced plants . these results are consistent with those from the conventional greenhouse evaluations.

discussion
the rar <dig> and sgt <dig> genes in potato
rar <dig> is a single copy gene in barley  <cit>  and a. thaliana  <cit> . our data from southern blot hybridizations confirm the previous report that only one copy of rar <dig> exists in the haploid potato genome  <cit> . plant rar <dig> mutants show no visible growth defects  <cit> , although silencing of the rar <dig> homolog in c. elegans resulted in semi sterility and embryo lethality  <cit> . the rar1-silenced potato plants did not show any visible growth phenotypes in our study.

sgt <dig> is an essential protein for proper kinetochore function in yeast and null mutations of the single copy sgt <dig> gene are lethal  <cit> . most plant species analyzed appear to contain two sgt <dig> genes  <cit> . the sgt1a and sgt1b double mutant in a. thaliana is embryo lethal  <cit> . similarly, virus-induced gene silencing  of the sgt <dig> genes  in n. benthamiana caused a stunt phenotype  <cit> . in tomato, silencing of the sgt1- <dig> gene, but not sgt1- <dig>  was lethal. this result was possibly caused by silencing of both the sgt1- <dig> and sgt1- <dig> genes using the vigs construct designed for sgt1- <dig>  <cit> . in contrast, silencing of the wheat and barley sgt <dig> genes by vigs did not result in a growth phenotype  <cit> . however, the copy number and functional redundancy of the sgt <dig> genes in wheat and barley are not clear, this may be caused by either partial silencing of the gene and/or compensated by partially homologous and non-silenced sgt genes in these species.

we did not observe any abnormal growth phenotype in the sgt <dig> silenced line. the complete silencing of the sgt <dig> gene was confirmed by northern blot hybridization . the available sequences of the two potato sgt <dig> genes  are 100% identical. the sgt <dig> cdna fragment used in our rnai contruct also shares 100% homology to these sequences. these results suggest that both copies of the potato sgt <dig> gene are likely silenced in the rnai silencing line. therefore, it appears that silencing both of the sgt <dig> genes is not lethal in potato. this result will need to be confirmed by multiple completely silenced sgt <dig> lines.

requirement of the rar <dig> and sgt <dig> proteins in disease resistance
a role of the rar <dig> protein in disease resistance signaling was first recognized in barley through mla12-mediated resistance against powdery mildew  <cit> . the same role for rar <dig> has since been identified in the resistance pathways conferred by several genes that belong to the nb-lrr family  <cit> . interestingly, there were also reports that the rar <dig> gene appears to not play a role in the resistance pathway. the rar1-independent cases include the mla1-mediated resistance against powdery mildew in barley  <cit> , bs2/avrbs2-mediated resistance against bacterial spot disease in n. benthamiana  <cit> , and mi-1-mediated resistance against root-knot nematodes in tomato  <cit> . we demonstrated that silencing of the single rar <dig> gene in potato does not affect the rb-mediated late blight resistance.

the previous rar1-independent conclusions were based on gene silencing techniques by biolistic delivery of double stranded rna constructs into single cells  <cit>  or by vigs  <cit> . these techniques may not result in complete suppression of a target gene and uniform silencing of the gene throughout the infected plants. false negative results have to be carefully sorted out because a low level of the transcripts resulting from incomplete silencing may be sufficient to facilitate the function of rar <dig>  the rnai-silenced rar <dig> potato lines showed no transcripts based on stringent northern blot hybridizations , suggesting a near complete silencing of the rar <dig> gene. these stable silenced lines allowed repeated resistance evaluations. thus, our results from multiple rnai silencing lines provide conclusive evidence that rb-mediated resistance is rar <dig> independent.

the rar <dig> protein has been proposed to be involved in forming or stabilizing the recognition complexes associated with r proteins or in assisting conformational changes of the recognition complexes  <cit> . such functions may not be required in the complex assembly of a subset of r proteins. bieri et al  showed that in barley rar <dig> mutants that are compromised for mla <dig> but not mla <dig> resistance, the steady state level of both mla isoforms is reduced. however, mla <dig> accumulated to about a four-fold lower level than mla <dig> in transgenic lines. interestingly, mla <dig> functions independently of rar <dig> only where mla <dig> abundance exceeds a threshold level  <cit> . a number of previous studies suggest that rar <dig> may control the abundance of the nb-lrr type r proteins  <cit> . we propose that the rb protein level in the rar <dig> silenced potato lines may be sufficient to trigger the resistance pathway.

many previous studies confirmed the requirement of the sgt <dig> protein in resistance mediated by both nb-lrr and pto-kinase type resistance genes, as well as in non-host resistance  <cit> . several resistance genes in a. thaliana were sgt1b independent in the sgt1b mutant background  <cit> . however, sgt1a may complement the loss of sgt1b  <cit> . the mla1-triggered resistance in barley, unlike other mla variants, was largely unaffected when the hvsgt <dig> gene was silenced  <cit> . the transient silencing method used in this system may not have been complete, leaving some levels of hvsgt <dig> for mla <dig> to function. alternatively, mla <dig> requires low levels of hvsgt <dig> to operate as compared to other mla variants  <cit> . bhattarai et al.  recently showed that partial silencing of the sgt1- <dig> gene in tomato resulted in attenuation of mi-1-mediated potato aphid resistance, but the same plants still held the mi-1-mediated root-knot nematode resistance. these results support the hypothesis that plant r proteins differ in the amounts of sgt <dig> needed to trigger effective resistance  <cit> . we demonstrate that silencing of sgt <dig> clearly compromised the rb-mediated late blight resistance , indicating that the rnai approach most likely silenced both copies of the sgt <dig> gene and the sgt <dig> gene plays the key role in the pathway. our results provide further evidence for the universal role of the sgt <dig> gene in various r gene-mediated plant defense responses.

CONCLUSIONS
we developed rnai-based silencing lines of genes rar <dig> and sgt <dig> in a potato line that contains the late blight resistance gene rb, which confers broad-spectrum resistance against all known races of p. infestans. silencing of the rar <dig> and sgt <dig> genes in potato does not result in phenotypic changes. late blight resistance evaluation of the rar <dig> and sgt <dig> silenced lines showed that the sgt <dig> gene is essential for the rb-mediated late blight resistance. in contrast, silencing of the rar <dig> gene does not abolish the rb-mediated resistance. these results provide additional evidence for the universal role of the sgt <dig> gene in various r gene-mediated plant defense responses.
