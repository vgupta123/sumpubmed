BACKGROUND
cytotoxic t lymphocytes  play an important role in the vertebrate immune system. ctls recognize pathogens via peptide presentation on major histocompatibility complex molecules . if the source of peptides is an infectious virus, the ctl response could be stimulated, thus leading to the elimination of virus-infected cells
 <cit> . mhc-bound peptides are called epitopes, and they are usually composed of 8– <dig> amino acids. epitope identification is an essential step toward synthetic vaccine development, since epitopes play an important role in the activation of the immune response
 <cit> . epitopes are traditionally identified by synthesizing a large number of nonapeptides and subsequently performing affinity assays. those peptides with high affinity for mhc proteins are considered as potential epitopes. however, the process of developing a new vaccine is time-consuming and laborious when performed with traditional methods. to avoid the problems of such bottlenecks, instead computational methods can be effectively applied to search for candidate peptides and identify new promising epitopes.

due to the importance of vaccines for human, we focus on mhcs in humans, which are referred to as the human leukocyte antigens . there are three classes of hlas: i, ii, and iii. epitopes presented on hla class i molecules are recognized by ctls. hla class i proteins can be categorized into three types according to their genes: hla-a, hla-b, and hla-c. a majority of previous studies have focused on the hla-a*02: <dig> allele because it is the most frequent allele of the a <dig> supertype in the northeast asian and caucasian populations
 <cit> . typically, the hla-a*02: <dig> epitope consists of 8– <dig> amino acids, and many studies have focused on nonapeptides in particular: that is, epitopes that are  <dig> residues long
 <cit> . figure
1a shows the nonapeptide epitope llfgypvyv fitted inside the hla-a*02: <dig> binding cleft, which consists of two α-helices and one β-sheet . figure
1b shows the conformation of the nonapeptide epitope llfgypvyv.

early epitope binding prediction algorithms were based on allele-specific motifs
 <cit> . for example, for the hla-a*02: <dig> allele, positions  <dig> and  <dig> of nonapeptides were the most important ones for binding. the residues at both positions were defined as classical anchor residues typically occupied by leucine, valine, and isoleucine since the mhc molecule forms hydrophobic sites for amino acids at these two positions
 <cit> . additionally, the residues at positions  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were identified as secondary anchor residues. positions  <dig> and  <dig> were mainly preferred by tyrosine and phenylalanine
 <cit> . the residue at position  <dig> was suggested to be an amphipathic residue suitable for amino acids with small hydrophobic side-chains such as valine and alanine
 <cit> . in this manner, unknown peptides that matched with such allele-specific motifs were determined to be epitopes.

as more data became available, statistical methods could be applied to calculating a positional scoring matrix. in the matrix, an element was defined individually for each position and specific amino acids, resulting in an l ×  <dig> coefficient matrix where l is the length of the peptide. in general, the matrix is used under the assumption that each amino acid in a peptide sequence independently contributes to a certain binding energy according to an element included in the positional scoring matrix. overall binding energy is estimated from the summation of binding energies from all positions. there are several methods based on such a positional scoring matrix: for example, bimas
 <cit> , rankpep
 <cit> , gibbs sampler
 <cit> , arb
 <cit> , smm
 <cit> , and smmpmbec <cit> .

currently, the most successful approach for epitope prediction utilizes machine learning algorithms. these algorithms require large enough datasets for training in order to obtain reliable results. fortunately, the immune epitope database 
 <cit>  provides more than  <dig>  mhc binding data related to t-cell epitopes from infectious pathogens, experimental pathogens, and self-antigens . iedb encompasses patent data from biotechnological and pharmaceutical companies, as well as direct submissions from research programs and partners. as reliable experimental data are provided, the volume promises a sufficient grounding for developing good predictive models. although iedb is not the only database that provides such information, it has more entries than other existing databases. examples of other databases are syfpeithi
 <cit> , fimm
 <cit> , mhcpep
 <cit> , mhcbn
 <cit> , and antijen
 <cit> . netmhc
 <cit> , a predictor based on artificial neural networks, used data from both iedb and syfpeithi and performed very well. svrmhc
 <cit> , a predictor based on support vector regression  used data from antijen and used libsvm
 <cit>  for svr-related implementation. moreover, there also exists an epitope predictor based on a hidden markov model
 <cit> .

the allele-specific motif method, the positional scoring matrix method, and machine learning-based methods use only sequence information in general. almost none of these methods can provide a clear explanation about the effects of the physicochemical properties of amino acids on binding affinity. in some cases, there are not enough peptides for training: e.g., when using data from rare alleles. therefore, three-dimensional  structure-based methods have been developed
 <cit>  to uncover binding mechanisms and address all forces related to binding affinity. however, such methods are currently less reliable than data-driven methods
 <cit> . the reason is that 3d structure-based methods usually require a number of crystal structures of mhc-peptide complexes, which are still not available in large numbers.

currently, more than  <dig>  hla alleles have been identified. searching for epitopes that bind to a large number of those alleles would be computationally exhaustive and time-consuming. therefore, the concept of allele supertypes was developed by clustering alleles into groups based on overlapping epitopes
 <cit> . within each supertype, most of the alleles should share the same epitopes. these epitopes are called ‘promiscuous epitopes’, which show great promise for vaccine development due to their potential for a high level of population coverage.

in this study, we have developed a novel epitope prediction method named epiccapo. peptides were encoded numerically by combining information on the peptide-mhc  contact sites with amino acid pairwise contact potentials , accompanied by a support vector machine 
 <cit> . our method’s performance was evaluated by using benchmark datasets and then compared with other high performance methods. in addition, identification of candidates of promiscuous ctl epitopes for influenza a viruses was demonstrated using the proposed method.

the h1n <dig> or h5n <dig> strain of influenza a virus caused a lethal flu in humans, as seen in the epidemics of 2005– <dig>  although inactivated influenza vaccination is beneficial, the development of more effective vaccines is still needed, particularly in elderly adults who are more susceptible to viral infections
 <cit> . identification of promiscuous ctl epitopes might aid this issue by providing candidate peptides from viral proteins for vaccine development.

RESULTS
comparison of peptide-encoding schemes
we compared our peptide-encoding scheme  with binary peptide-encoding and with four amino acid descriptors . the results of the comparison of the peptide-encoding schemes  showed that epiccapo performed better than others in the classification tasks. it achieved the highest average area under the curve , followed by binary encoding , dpps , fasgai , z-scale , and isa/eci  schemes. all of standard deviations were less than  <dig> . a comparison of receiver operating characteristic  curves is shown in figure
 <dig> 

means and standard deviations were calculated by  <dig> iterations of 10-fold cross validation.

underlined values represent the highest performance.

sens = sensitivity; spec = specificity; f <dig> = f-score; acc = accuracy; auc = area under the curve.

*these three top-ranked aapps were micc <dig>  simk <dig>  and simk <dig> .

although epiccapo used the largest number of features —higher than binary encoding , dpps , fasgai , z-scale , and isa/eci —we confirmed that its high performance was not due to a larger number of features. in our study, the training dataset was separated into  <dig> datasets corresponding to  <dig> aapps. each dataset consisted of  <dig> features. the classification functions were fitted to these datasets, and after that the aapps were ranked by auc. the results, as shown in table
 <dig>  suggested that even by using only three top-ranked aapps , the classification performance values are comparable to those obtained by using all aapps. these three top-ranked aapps were micc <dig>  simk <dig>  and simk <dig> . they have been previously used in identifying native-like protein structures
 <cit> , and were also identified as important aapps in our accompanying experiments.

classification results of benchmark datasets
we applied epiccapo to benchmark datasets of  <dig> mhc-i alleles
 <cit> . as shown in table
 <dig>  netmhc performed the best, ahead of arb, smm, and smmpmbec. for epiccapo, average aucs were lower than in netmhc  in  <dig> allele datasets and were higher than in netmhc  in  <dig> allele datasets when using all of the  <dig> aapps . almost all of standard deviations were low except several alleles with results of standard deviation larger than  <dig> . however, if more data are available, these standard deviations can be decreased. to improve the performance of our method, we developed epiccapo+ by selecting an appropriate subset of aapps. as seen in table
 <dig>  the performance of epiccapo+ was higher than epiccapo and comparable with netmhc. the overall performance of epiccapo+ is significantly higher than that of other methods according to a paired t-test  comparison of average aucs from all alleles. the ids of aapps used for estimating the predictive models of epiccapo+ are shown in additional file
 <dig> 

for each dataset, aucs were evaluated based on 5-fold cross validation. in the lower part, p-values of average aucs were calculated using paired t-tests .

means and standard deviations were calculated by  <dig> iterations of 5-fold cross validation for epiccapo and epiccapo+.

underlined values represent the highest performance among arb, smm, smmpmbec, and netmhc. values in bold represent significant improvements of epiccapo or epiccapo+ aucs from  <dig> iterations of 5-fold cross validation over the underlined values according to t-tests .

improved hla-a-nonapeptide binding predictive models
in this experiment, epiccapo+ was further developed as epiccapo+ref to improve the predictive performance and identify important positions of nonapeptides in pmhc binding . the ids of aapps used in epiccapo+ref are shown in table
 <dig> . the most important aapps identified by epiccapo+ were ids  <dig>  and  <dig> , which were selected in  <dig> out of  <dig> alleles. ids  <dig>  and  <dig>  were also considered to be important, because they were selected in  <dig> out of  <dig> alleles. from previous studies that used aapps in mhc i epitope prediction, aapp ids  <dig>  and  <dig>  proved to be important in peptide-mhc binding predictions
 <cit> . in our study, however, betm <dig> was not selected for an aapp subset for any allele, and miys <dig> was chosen for only two alleles . in a report by schueler-furman et al.
 <cit> , keso <dig> was also tested and compared with miys960102; however, there was no significant improvement in the predictive performance. therefore, it is interesting that micc <dig>  simk <dig>  keso <dig>  and simk <dig> were important for generating better predictive models in our study.

we further investigated the generated features according to the selected subset of aapps. in our peptide-encoding scheme, nine features were generated from one aapp, corresponding to the nine amino acid positions in the nonapeptide. previous studies have indicated that not all positions were important in pmhc binding
 <cit> . therefore, some features corresponding to specific positions could be removed to improve the predictive performance.

the relief algorithm
 <cit>  was employed in our study to rank the features according to their importance in separating the nonbinding peptides from the binding ones. the ranking results showed that the ten top-ranked features correspond to positions  <dig> and  <dig> in most of the alleles, followed by positions  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> . as indicated in tables
 <dig> and
 <dig>  the overall auc value of epiccapo+ref was higher than that of epiccapo+; however, it was still slightly lower than that of netmhc in the a*01: <dig> and a*02: <dig> alleles. in summary, epiccapo+ref performed better than other methods, with an average auc of  <dig> . table
 <dig> also shows the number of selected features after employing the relief-f algorithm. these numbers were different for specific alleles. for the a*01: <dig>  a*02: <dig>  and a*06: <dig> alleles, no features were removed. however, for the a*02: <dig>  a*24: <dig>  a*29: <dig>  and a*68: <dig> alleles,  <dig> or more features were removed. interestingly, features corresponding to positions  <dig> and  <dig>  which have previously been considered to not significantly contribute to hla binding potentials, were still included in some of the selected feature subsets. therefore, we assumed that features corresponding to different positions are not independent, and that all features from all positions should be required input to estimate the model with the highest-performance .

candidates of promiscuous epitopes for a development of influenza a viral vaccines
since epiccapo+ref performed better than the other existing methods when testing with  <dig> hla-a allele datasets, it was further used to find candidates of promiscuous epitopes from influenza a viral sequences. epitopes from protein sequences of h1n <dig> , h3n <dig> , h1n <dig> , and h5n <dig>  were identified using epiccapo+ref. the prediction results of all influenza a strains categorized into specific alleles are shown in table
 <dig>  all  <dig> alleles were assigned to supertype groups using the supertype classification defined by previous studies
 <cit> . the a*01: <dig> and a*26: <dig> alleles were assigned to the a <dig> group. the a*29: <dig> allele was assigned to an unidentified group. as shown in table
 <dig>  there are a small number of predicted positive peptides in the a <dig> supertype. for example, in case of h1n <dig> , only one peptide was identified as positive for the allele a*26: <dig>  in contrast, there were quite high numbers of predicted positive peptides in the a <dig>  a <dig>  and a <dig> supertypes. even the a*29: <dig> allele, which was assigned to an unidentified group, had a higher number of predicted positive peptides than those in the a <dig> group. based on our findings, when promiscuous epitopes were identified from the overlapping epitopes of four influenza a viral strains , the a <dig> group rarely shared peptides with other groups. as shown in additional file
 <dig>  the a*01: <dig> allele shared only one peptide  with a*29: <dig>  and the a*26: <dig> allele shared the peptide dtvnrthqy with a*29: <dig> and a*68: <dig>  moreover, the a*29: <dig> allele also shared peptides with the a <dig> and a <dig> groups: e.g., smelpsfgv and qtydwtlnr, respectively . therefore, a*29: <dig> can be considered as a special group that links a <dig>  a <dig>  and a <dig> together. furthermore, doytchinova et al.
 <cit>  assigned a*29: <dig> to the a <dig> group. however, we did not find overlapping epitopes from the four influenza a viral strains in the a*24: <dig> allele assigned to the a <dig> group. this suggested that a*24: <dig> itself is different from other alleles considered here, and this might be the reason why most of the previous studies assigned it separately to the a <dig> group
 <cit> . as shown in additional file
 <dig>   <dig> peptides  of the total  <dig> epitopes were immunologically validated as positive, whereas  <dig> peptides  were validated as negative. no evidence of immunological validation could be obtained for  <dig> peptides . these results indicate that our newly developed method provides a markedly high accuracy in epitope identification, given the fact that most of the identified epitopes could be correlated with immunological experimental evidence. however, even without such immunological evidence, those epitopes identified by our computational approach might be considered as candidates for new vaccine development.

our results are in agreement with the study by uchida
 <cit> , which identified promiscuous epitopes from influenza a h1n <dig> , h3n <dig> , h1n <dig> , and h5n <dig> . uchida found experimentally confirmed ctl epitopes in the a <dig> group. in our results, the epitopes identified by epiccapo+ref in the a <dig> group were consistent with them . in addition, we found promising candidates of promiscuous epitopes also for the a <dig> and a <dig> groups as shown in additional file
 <dig> 

although the overall performance of epiccapo+ref was high, there are two limitations in the use of this method. the first limitation is the length of input peptides must be equal to  <dig>  in the further study, we will improve epiccapo+ref to be applicable to peptides with the length of 8– <dig>  the second limitation is that input amino acids must not be special or ambiguous ones. examples of special amino acids are u  and o . also, examples of ambiguous amino acids are b , z , and j . epiccapo+ref are not applicable with these amino acids since they are not included in aapps.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have developed a novel method for epitope prediction. peptides were encoded numerically, combining information of pmhc contact sites and amino acid pairwise contact potentials, accompanied by an svm for estimating the predictive model. our method achieved high performance in testing with benchmark datasets. in addition, our study identified a number of candidates of promiscuous ctl epitopes from four influenza a viral strains, consistent with previously reported immunological experiments. this consistency in results strongly supports the accuracy of our method. we speculate that our techniques may be useful in identifying promising candidates of promiscuous epitopes for the development of new vaccines.
