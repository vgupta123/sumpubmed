BACKGROUND
p2x receptors comprise a family of membrane cation channels gated by extracellular atp. seven subtypes , each encoded for by a separate gene, are present in mammalian species  and these combine to form either homo or hetero trimeric channels  <cit>  exhibiting different expression profiles and functional properties. p2x <dig>  the first subtype to be isolated, was cloned over a decade ago  <cit>  and the physiological roles of this channel in the regulation of arterial tone  <cit>  and in the neuronal control of smooth muscle contraction  <cit>  are well established. the presence of p2x <dig> receptors in platelets was discovered shortly after its cloning  <cit> , however, it has not been until more recent times that the physiological importance of p2x <dig> in platelet function has started to fully emerge . activation of platelet p2x <dig> receptors by extracellular atp results in a rapid ca2+ influx which activates cytoskeletal events to induce a transient but substantial shape change and granule centralization  <cit> , both important early events in platelet activation. p2x <dig> receptors can also synergize with p2y, collagen, adrenaline and thrombopoietin receptor mediated responses  <cit>  to enhance platelet function. furthermore, over expression of p2x <dig> in the platelets of transgenic mice results in a prothrombotic phenotype  <cit>  whereas an absence of the receptor in p2x <dig> knockout mice leads to a reduced risk of thrombosis  <cit>  suggesting that the level of p2x <dig> receptor expression in platelets is of physiological and clinical significance.

although the physiological roles and consequences of altered expression levels of platelet p2x <dig> receptors are becoming increasingly apparent, the mechanisms that regulate p2x <dig> expression in platelets are poorly understood. since platelets are cell fragments devoid of any nuclei the complement of channels and receptors present on their surface must ultimately rely on the regulation of gene transcription in the megakaryocyte, the platelet precursor cell. bhlh factors and e proteins are thought to be involved in smooth muscle specific p2x <dig> transcription  <cit> . nothing however is known about transcriptional regulation of p2x <dig> in megakaryoblastic cells. in order to initiate studies on the transcriptional mechanisms involved in determining p2x <dig> expression levels in platelets, we have identified and characterized the p2x <dig> promoter in the megakaryoblastic cell line meg- <dig>  <cit> . we show that sp <dig> and nf- <dig> regulatory elements located in the direct vicinity of the transcriptional start site are essential for basal transcription of p2x <dig> in meg- <dig> cells.

RESULTS
cloning and analysis of the p2x <dig> gene 5' upstream sequence
the human genomic bac clone rp11-167n <dig> was found to contain all  <dig> exons of the human p2x <dig> gene and  <dig> kb 5' upstream sequence. the  <dig>  kb upstream of the atg start codon was cloned into the pgl- <dig> basic luciferase reporter plasmid to generate the plasmid p-4407/+ <dig> and the sequence analyzed by the proscan computer program  <cit> . a potential core promoter was predicted at - <dig> to + <dig> bp with a promoter score of  <dig> .

the p2x <dig> transcription start site is located  <dig> bp upstream of the start codon
to map the location of the p2x <dig> transcription initiation site in meg- <dig> cells, four anti-sense oligonucleotides pet <dig>  pet <dig>  pet <dig> and pet <dig>  were used for primer extension. as positive control we utilized a previously published primer sequence ptxrhr- <dig> which has been used to map the transcription start site of the thromboxane receptor gene in meg- <dig> cells  <cit> . similar to previous studies, this control primer yielded a single extension product of ~ <dig> bp . a single extension product of ~ <dig> bp was generated by pet <dig> , two distinct extension products of ~ <dig> bp and ~ <dig> bp, were generated by pet <dig> , a doublet band of ~ <dig> bp was generated by pet <dig>  and no extension products were observed from pet <dig> . extension products of  <dig> bp ,  <dig> bp  and  <dig> bp  correspond to a transcription start site located ~ <dig> bp upstream of the atg start codon. the pet <dig> sequence is very close to this site  and so would not be expected to produce an extension product. an additional extension product of  <dig> bp produced by the pet <dig> primer  indicated the possibility of an additional transcription start site located ~ <dig> bp upstream of start codon. however, no bands corresponding to such a start site were observed with the pet <dig>  pet <dig> or pet <dig> primers. furthermore, subsequent analysis of promoter activity in constructs where this potential site had been removed ) did not indicate the presence of a functional transcription start site in this region. we therefore attributed the  <dig> bp band produced by the pet <dig> primer as a non-specific extension product. to precisely map the start site, sequencing reactions primed with the same pet primer used for primer extension were run in parallel to extension reactions . the  <dig> bp pet <dig> extension product  corresponds to a transcription start site located at a "t" residue  <dig> bp upstream of the atg start codon. this site is  <dig> bp downstream of the start site previously described for p2x <dig> in smooth muscle  <cit>  but matches closely to the est clone bx <dig> which was isolated from human bone marrow, a tissue rich in megakaryocytes.

pma induced differentiation results in a 20-fold increase in p2x <dig> reporter gene activity
in initial studies, we tested the p-4407/+ <dig> construct for promoter activity in three cell lines previously reported to show endogenous p2x <dig> expression, meg- <dig>  <cit> , hl- <dig>  <cit>  and jurkat  <cit> . the human kidney proximal tubular epithelial cell line hk <dig> was used as negative control. cells were assayed both with and without prior treatment with pma, a phorbol ester previously reported to increase p2x <dig> mediated currents in meg- <dig>  <cit>  and hl- <dig>  <cit>  cells. low promoter activity was detected in untreated meg- <dig>  hl- <dig> and jurkat cells but not in hk <dig> cells . treatment of meg- <dig> cells with  <dig> nm pma caused cells to differentiate to a non-proliferating adherent phenotype and resulted in a ~ <dig> fold increase in promoter activity of p-4407/+ <dig>  this pma-induced increase was also apparent in jurkat and hl- <dig> cells but not in hk <dig> cells . comparisons of promoter activity between different constructs in untreated meg- <dig> cells proved problematic since promoter activities were not sufficiently above background to allow accurate quantification. pma-differentiated meg- <dig> cells were therefore utilized for subsequent analysis since these cells represent a well characterized model of megakaryocyte maturation  <cit>  and the higher p2x <dig> promoter activity aided quantification of differences between constructs.

deletion analysis of luciferase reporter gene constructs
to define the mechanisms controlling transcriptional regulation of p2x <dig> in meg- <dig> cells, a series of deletion constructs were generated. gradual deletion of 5' sequence from - <dig> to - <dig> resulted in no significant change in luciferase activity  suggesting that no important regulatory elements reside in this ~ <dig> kb region. removal of sequence between - <dig> and - <dig> in construct p-1398/+ <dig> however resulted in a  <dig> ± 14% increase  in promoter activity indicating the presence of a repressive element. sequence analysis of this region revealed a  <dig> bp polypyrimidine tract located - <dig> to - <dig> bp which contains  <dig> copies of the sequence motif 5'-tccctccctccc-3'. interestingly, this same sequence motif is present in the mouse c-ki-ras promoter where it plays a role in transcriptional regulation  <cit> . within this polypyrimidine tract region are clustered multiple potential sp <dig>  ets- <dig> and maz transcription factor binding sites. the increase in promoter activity was maintained throughout deletions from  <dig> to  <dig> in the constructs p-805/ <dig>  p-454/+ <dig>  p-330/+ <dig>  and p-190/+ <dig>  . the difference in promoter activity between constructs p-1398/+ <dig> through to p-190/+ <dig> was not significant. removal of 3' sequence from + <dig> to + <dig> bp  decreased promoter activity back to the level of the p-4407/+ <dig> construct. deletion of 5' sequence from - <dig> to - <dig> bp  resulted in a  <dig> ± 5% decrease  in promoter activity. further deletion of  <dig> bp 5' sequence in construct p-68/+ <dig> produced no significant change in activity from p-111/+ <dig>  removal of 3' sequence however from + <dig> to + <dig> bp in construct p-190/+ <dig> completely abolished promoter activity.

thus, to summarize the deletion analysis performed on the p2x <dig> upstream region, promoter activity was stable or increased in 5' deletions from - <dig> through to position - <dig>  deletions past - <dig> up to position - <dig> significantly reduced promoter activity whereas removal of  <dig> bp from + <dig> to + <dig> bp abolished promoter function demonstrating that this region contains regulatory elements essential for transcription.

in vitro binding of sp1/ <dig> and nf- <dig> to the p2x <dig> promoter
results from the above deletion analysis suggested that the region - <dig> to + <dig> bp plays an important role in the transcriptional regulation of the p2x <dig> gene . analysis of this region using the programmes tess  <cit>  and proscan  <cit>  did not reveal putative tata or ccaat boxes, but detected several potential transcription factor binding sites including nf-κb, yy- <dig>  gata- <dig>  nf- <dig>  and multiple sp <dig> sites. to begin to understand which specific transcription factors are involved in regulating p2x <dig> gene transcription we initially performed emsas on nuclear extracts from pma-treated meg- <dig> cells using oligonucleotides corresponding to a potential nf- <dig> site and two sp <dig> sites  located in the immediate vicinity of the transcription start site. the radiolabelled probe o-nf <dig> containing a potential nf- <dig> binding site produced a major retarded band , the formation of which was prevented by an excess of unlabelled o-nf <dig> itself  but not by the mutated o-nf1-mut probe . in the presence of an anti-nf- <dig> antibody, the dna-protein complexes were either supershifted or remained in the well . similar results for nf- <dig> supershift complexes have also been reported in previous studies  <cit> , we therefore concluded that nf- <dig> can bind to the p2x <dig> proximal promoter.

the probes o-sp1a and o-sp1b corresponding to the sp1a and sp1b binding sites respectively, gave rise to three major dna-protein complexes, the larger two of which appear as a doublet band . to identify specific transcription factor binding, supershift assays with sp <dig> and sp <dig> antibodies were performed. the sp <dig> antibody produced a supershift . sp <dig> antibodies caused a decrease in intensity of the doublet band but produced no visible supershifted products . to further clarify the molecular basis of sp1/sp <dig> interactions with the oligonucleotide probes, competition experiments were performed . addition of unlabelled o-sp1a or o-sp1b prevented binding of sp1/sp <dig> to labelled probe . similarly, addition of an unlabelled commercial consensus sp <dig> oligonucleotide  also prevented sp1/sp <dig> binding to o-sp1a and o-sp1b. in contrast o-sp1a-mut and o-sp1b-mut did not prevent protein binding  demonstrating that a  <dig> bp mutation  disrupted sp1/ <dig> binding.

an oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the potential nf-κb binding site  did not produce super-shifted products after addition of an nf-κb antibody . in summary emsas demonstrated that sp <dig>  sp <dig> and nf- <dig> transcription factors can bind regulatory elements in the p2x <dig> proximal promoter implying that these factors are involved in the regulation of p2x <dig> gene transcription.

sp <dig> and nf- <dig> sites are essential for basal transcription of the p2x <dig> gene
we next conducted site-directed mutagenesis to disrupt the sp1/ <dig>  nf- <dig> and nf-κb binding sites in selected p2x <dig> promoter constructs. promoter activity of mutated constructs was determined in pma treated meg- <dig> cells and expressed relative to that of the wild type p-190/+ <dig> construct . single mutation of the nf-κb  and sp1a  sites produced no significant change in promoter activity . single mutation of the nf- <dig> site  or sp1b site  however resulted in  <dig> ± 5%  and  <dig> ± 2%  reductions respectively. a double mutation ablating both nf- <dig> and nf-κb sites simultaneously  reduced promoter activity by  <dig> ± 2% , whereas double mutation of sp1a and sp1b sites  reduced activity by 92% ±  <dig> . simultaneous mutation of nf- <dig> and sp1b sites , the nf- <dig> site together with sp1a and sp1b sites , or deletion of the fragment from + <dig> to + <dig> bp which removes both sp1a and sp1b sites  effectively abolished promoter activity .

in order to confirm the apparent redundancy of the potential nf-κb site, we generated a further set of mutations in the plasmid p-111/+ <dig>  a construct where the potential nf-κb site has been removed . whilst removal of  <dig> bp from - <dig> to - <dig> resulted in a ~50% decrease in promoter activity, the overall pattern of promoter activity resulting from sp <dig> and nf- <dig> binding site mutations was very similar to that observed in the p-190/+ <dig> mutations .

a p2x <dig> transcription start site  <dig> bp upstream from site identified in this current study has been reported in human smooth muscle cells  <cit> . if this same site is utilized in meg- <dig> cells then its removal in deletion constructs would be expected to abolish promoter activity. to test this hypothesis and to further delineate a functional core promoter, the construct p-68/+ <dig> was generated. p-68/+ <dig> displayed a promoter activity  <dig> ± 3% that of the p-190/+ <dig> construct. single and double site-directed mutations of sp <dig> and nf- <dig> binding sites in this p-68/+ <dig> construct again showed a similar pattern of promoter activity to that observed in the p-190/+ <dig> construct .

from the above mutation and previous deletion analysis, we defined the region spanning - <dig> to + <dig> as the p2x <dig> core promoter composing of a single nf- <dig> binding site and two sp1-binding sites. to prove the importance of these sites in controlling basal transcription, the sp1a, sp1b and nf- <dig> sites were mutated in the original  <dig>  kb reporter construct p-4407/+ <dig> to generate the construct p-4407/+ <dig>  promoter activity from this triple mutated construct was abolished in both untreated and pma-treated meg- <dig> cells  confirming the essential roles of sp <dig> and nf- <dig> in p2x <dig> basal transcription.

direct binding of sp1/ <dig> and nf- <dig> to the endogenous p2x <dig> core promoter
having identified sp <dig>  sp <dig> and nf- <dig> sites essential for p2x <dig> reporter gene function, we next utilized chip to determine whether the corresponding transcription factors are physically recruited to the endogenous p2x <dig> core promoter in vivo . primers for the hsp <dig> and histone h <dig> promoters were used as positive controls as sp <dig> and sp <dig> have previously been detected at these promoters by chip assay  <cit> . as a negative control, parallel experiments using primers for the coding region of the gapdh gene were performed. antibodies for sp <dig>  sp <dig>  nf- <dig> and tfiib in chip assays using chromatin isolated from pma-treated meg- <dig> cells resulted in enrichment of the dna genomic segment harboring the region -197/+ <dig> of the p2x <dig> gene thus confirming the in vivo recruitment of these factors to the core promoter.

discussion
regulation of p2x <dig> transcription in megakaryocytic cells is of physiological and clinical importance as ultimately this will influence the level of p2x <dig> receptor present on platelets, excessive activation of which can lead to thrombosis, cardiovascular disease and stroke. as a first step towards understanding the transcriptional mechanisms regulating p2x <dig> expression in megakaryocytic cells, we have analyzed the p2x <dig> promoter in meg- <dig> cells. we identified a transcription start site  <dig> bp upstream of the start codon and defined a core promoter located within the region - <dig> to + <dig> bp. two sp <dig> sites and an nf- <dig> site in the core promoter were shown to be critical for basal transcription.

the p2x <dig> core promoter was found not to possess "tata" or "ccaat" elements but contained sp <dig> and nf- <dig> sites critical for basal transcription. mammalian promoters lacking a tata box often contain sp <dig> elements and rely on sp <dig> to recruit tata-binding protein and guide rna polymerase ii to the initiator site  <cit> . sp <dig> and sp <dig> are members of a large family of transcription factors that regulate transcription through interactions with gc-boxes. they are both zinc finger proteins that bind the same dna recognition sequences with similar affinity  <cit> . despite ubiquitous expression, tissue-specific gene activation by sp <dig> and sp <dig> may be achieved by a variety of mechanisms including variability in the concentration of sp <dig> and sp <dig>  <cit> , interactions of sp <dig> with tissue specific transcription factors  <cit>  and tissue specific post-translational modification of sp <dig> and sp <dig>  <cit> . sp1/ <dig> can regulate gene transcription through a variety of mechanisms, functioning as either a basal promoter element or an upstream activator, depending on promoter  <cit> . two sp1/ <dig> sites were identified in the p2x <dig> promoter and mutation of the sp1b  site most markedly reduced promoter activity. single mutation of the sp1a  site did not significantly reduce transcription. however, simultaneous mutation of both sp1a and sp1b together entirely abolished transcriptional activity. thus, the sp1b site can completely compensate for the loss of the sp1a site but sp1a can only partially compensate for the loss of sp1b suggesting that whilst both sites may be utilized in basal transcription, the sp1b site plays a more prominent role.

an nf- <dig> site in the p2x <dig> core promoter was also found to be important for transcription. nf- <dig> proteins are recruited to promoters in a cell type specific manner and can associate with different regulators to either activate or repress transcription depending on the promoter and cellular context  <cit> . site-directed mutagenesis of the nf- <dig> site in the p2x <dig> core promoter significantly reduced transcriptional activity by ~80% . simultaneous mutation of both nf- <dig> and sp1b sites completely abolished promoter activity suggesting that nf- <dig> and sp1/ <dig> may act synergistically to recruit the initiation complex to the p2x <dig> core promoter.

the human p2x <dig> promoter identified in this study shows characteristics typical of those normally associated with housekeeping genes: lack of classical tata or ccaat boxes, an increased gc content and critical sp <dig> and nf- <dig> elements  <cit> . this would appear ideally suited for p2x <dig> expression in megakaryocytes since constant synthesis is required for platelet production. constitutive expression of p2x <dig> however does not occur in all hematic cell types and their progenitors as neutrophils, monocytes and lymphocytes show no significant expression of p2x <dig>  <cit> . this suggests that tight repression of the p2x <dig> promoter occurs and that release from this repression may be an important feature of p2x <dig> transcriptional regulation. deletion analysis performed in this study identified a repressive element in an upstream region containing a  <dig> bp polypyrimidine tract located - <dig> to - <dig>  removal of this tract in deletion constructs p-1398/+ <dig> through to p-190/+ <dig> resulted in a ~90–100% increase in promoter activity . polypyrimidine tracts can harbor multiple binding sites for sp <dig> and sp <dig>  <cit>  and play important roles in the regulation of gene transcription  <cit> . a possible mechanism for the repressive effect of the p2x <dig> polypyrimidine tract could be that this region facilitates a local sequestration of sp1/ <dig> factors hindering their binding to the sp1a and sp1b sites further downstream in the core promoter.

important transcriptional regulatory elements often show conservation between species  <cit> . we therefore investigated whether the nf- <dig>  sp1a and sp1b binding sites identified in the human promoter are also present in the upstream sequence of p2x <dig> genes from other species. using blast searches of genomic sequence data we identified p2x <dig> genes from mouse, chimp, dog and rat. similar to human, the upstream regions of these genes were also gc-rich and contained no "tata" or "ccaat" elements. sequence alignment revealed nf- <dig>  sp1a and sp1b sites in identical positions across all species examined . these results demonstrate a conserved core promoter structure in mammalian p2x <dig> genes and suggest that the involvement of sp1/ <dig> and nf- <dig> in the regulation of p2x <dig> transcription has been conserved during evolution.

pma-induced differentiation of meg- <dig> cells is widely used as a model of megakaryocytic maturation and is known to increase the expression of megakaryocytic lineage specific antigens, such as integrin αiibβ <dig>  <cit> . pma activates signaling cascades via activation of pkc and other c <dig> domain containing receptors resulting in a wide range of cellular effects  <cit> . pma can enhance p2x <dig> mediated responses in meg- <dig>  <cit> , thp <dig>  <cit> , and hl- <dig>  <cit>  cells and is also thought to have more acute effects by increasing phosphorylation of a putative p2x <dig> accessory protein  <cit> . in this study, we found that p2x <dig> promoter activity increased ~20-fold in pma-differentiated meg- <dig> cells compared to untreated cells. several studies have shown sp <dig> dna-binding activity and expression level to increase upon treatment of cells with pma  <cit> . similarly, pma induction has been shown to increase the formation of nf- <dig> dna complexes  <cit> . we therefore speculate that pma enhances p2x <dig> ion channel function through the actions of sp <dig> and nf- <dig> at the p2x <dig> core promoter resulting in an increase in gene transcription and the synthesis of new p2x <dig> protein. the signaling pathways that link pma stimulation with p2x <dig> gene activation and whether these result in alterations in the levels of sp <dig> and nf- <dig> or in protein modifications such as phosphorylation altering the affinity of factors for their respective binding sites remain to be determined.

CONCLUSIONS
the in vivo control of p2x <dig> transcription in megakaryocytes is undoubtedly a complex combinatorial process involving the integration of a large number of protein-protein and protein-dna interactions that mediate cell type specific expression during megakaryocyte differentiation and the ability respond to regulatory inputs. this study provides the first steps towards unraveling the complexities of this control by providing the fundamental information of p2x <dig> core promoter location and composition in a megakaryocytic cell line. we demonstrate that sp <dig> and nf- <dig> are critical for p2x <dig> core promoter function in both proliferating and pma-differentiated meg- <dig> cells. the targeting of signaling pathways that influence the function of these transcription factors in megakaryocytes may therefore provide the basis for the future therapeutic manipulation of platelet p2x <dig> function.
