BACKGROUND
bacteria of the gram-positive genus streptomyces are of great scientific and economic importance. streptomycetes are saprophytic, aerobic, soil dwelling bacteria which undergo complex differentiation to form mycelium, aerial hyphae and spores, and produce a diverse array of secondary metabolites, such as antibiotics and bioactive compounds  <cit> . there are a number of published streptomycete genomes including streptomyces griseus  <cit> , streptomyces avermitilis  <cit>  and streptomyces coelicolor  <cit> . the genomes of the sequenced streptomycetes consist of large  linear chromosomes with high  g+c content  <cit> . the chromosomes show synteny to each other in the central 'core', a region thought to contain conserved and highly expressed genes, and also contain two flanking 'arm' regions, proposed regions of high horizontal gene transfer  with high recombination rates  <cit> . the large sizes of streptomycete genomes are thought to be related to the diversity of environmental niches which streptomyces encounter.

s. lividans is known to be closely related to s. coelicolor a <dig> and has a virtually identical  16s rdna sequence  <cit> . both species are members of the s. violaceoruber clade in 16s rdna phylogenetic trees  <cit> . the similarities in basic genomic structure and genetic organisation of the s. coelicolor and s. lividans chromosomes have long been known  <cit> . however, it is clear that many genomic differences are present, e.g. s. lividans  <dig> possesses a  <dig> kb "genomic island" in its chromosome, relative to that of s. coelicolor a <dig>  <cit> , and does not contain the same fertility plasmids as s. coelicolor, a <dig> instead harbouring the plasmids slp <dig>  <cit>  and slp <dig>  <cit> . these, and other genetic differences, are reflected in phenotypic differences. for example, s. lividans differs from s. coelicolor in that its dna is degraded during electrophoresis in buffers containing traces of ferrous iron. this phenomenon is due to a dna phosphorothioate modification conferred by a cluster of five dnd genes which are only present in the s.lividans genome in the  <dig> kb island  <cit> . although, s. lividans exhibits most of the secondary metabolic capability that s. coelicolor possesses it does not produce antibiotics to the same extent, for reasons which are unclear. however, a number of studies have shown that antibiotic gene clusters can be "awakened" in s. lividans through the over-expression of regulatory factors such as afss and actii-orf <dig>  <cit> .

s. lividans is one of the most commonly used streptomyces hosts for dna cloning  <cit>  and heterologous protein production  <cit> . it has several features that make it a suitable host for efficient recombinant protein expression, including the absence of a methylation-dependent restriction system  <cit>  which recognizes and degrades methylated dna isolated from commonly used escherichia coli strains  <cit> . additionally, s. lividans has very low endogenous extracellular proteolytic activity when compared to other streptomyces species, leading to higher product recovery  <cit> . moreover, in comparison with e. coli, s. lividans is a better host for eukaryotic recombinant protein production because the recombinant proteins produced in s. lividans tend to have higher levels of solubility, therefore avoiding the problem of inclusion body formation.

for streptomycetes for which no genome sequence is available, comparative genomic hybridization , through the use of microarrays, provides a useful tool for the comparison of genetic content between strains. while microarrays cannot detect chromosomal rearrangements or single nucleotide polymorphisms, oligonucleotide based microarrays can be hybridized using stringent conditions which enable the detection of small numbers of bases changes, and can be a powerful tool in detecting gene duplication, horizontal gene transfer  and gene loss/divergence. a previous comparative study of s. lividans tk <dig> against s. coelicolor m <dig> has been conducted by jayapal and co-workers  <cit> . however, because spotted pcr product based arrays were used the findings were limited to identification of large-scale differences,  between gene coding regions. in the present study the genomic differences between the sequenced s. coelicolor m <dig> strain,  strain) and two s. lividans strains: s. lividans  <dig> , and its plasmid free derivative strain s. lividans tk <dig>  have been determined using our novel high-density s. coelicolor microarrays. our aim was to determine whether high-resolution cgh could identify small insertions/deletions . it was anticipated that this study would serve not only to experimentally validate the microarray platform, but also shed light on the genotypic differences between the two streptomycete species, and also between the two strains of s. lividans.

RESULTS
production of high density 104k Ã— 60-mer s. coelicolor dna microarray
due to the high g+c content of s. coelicolor  it was necessary to experimentally test specificity of a large set of probes in order to select a validated subset for comprehensive coverage of the genome. the resulting 104k microarray comprises almost  <dig>  unique 60-mers  with an average spacing of  <dig> nucleotides. the 104k array is designed for cgh, chip-chip and high resolution transcriptome analysis, covering all known genes and all intergenic regions; both strands of the genome are represented for the latter.

high resolution comparative genomics
the availability of the genome sequence of s. coelicolor allows the use of post-genomic technologies such as microarrays to explore the genomic content of other streptomyces species. here we have used the 104k array to examine the genomic differences between s. coelicolor m <dig> and s. lividans  <dig> and its plasmid free derivative strain s. lividans tk <dig> using novel, ink-jet in situ synthesized  high density microarrays. thus, the averaged  normalised log <dig> ratios, with m <dig> genomic dna as the common denominator , for each probe can be ordered by the genomic position as it appears in the annotated s. coelicolor genome sequence. consequently, the differences between the two s. lividans strain chromosomes and the s. coelicolor m <dig> chromosome can be readily observed and compared . furthermore, by importing the data into gack , software built around an algorithm that selects a dynamic cut-off value based on the shape of the signal ratio distribution  <cit> , a binary classification of presence/absence could be applied to generate a list of present/absent probes which is represented diagrammatically in figure 1b.

prima facie, we were confident that regions of difference identified by multiple contiguous probes indeed represented genuine phenomena and demonstrated the presence of substantial sequence differences between s. coelicolor and the s. lividans strains. however, initially our confidence in the validity of single probe absences was less. the microarray probe design and validation procedure  <cit>  was such that only probes that exhibited a reduction in signal intensity  following inclusion of a three nucleotide mismatch were selected. therefore, to experimentally verify in a real world experimental situation whether the apparently missing isolated probes were in fact genuine absences, or false negatives, and whether the microarrays were operating according to specification, we selected several regions targeted by these single, isolated 'absent' probes for further analysis.

investigation of a single non-binding probe in the cda biosynthetic gene cluster
analysis of the results obtained using the 104k array design  indicated the apparent absence/divergence in both s. lividans strains of a probe-binding sequence corresponding to nucleotides 3560106- <dig> of the s. coelicolor chromosome , i.e. in the adenylation domain of module  <dig>  of cdapsi of the calcium dependent antibiotic  biosynthetic cluster  <cit> . also, significantly, absence of this probe-binding sequence suggested the absence of the corresponding sequence present in the adenylation domain of module  <dig>  in s. lividans  <dig>  as the sequence in this region in s. coelicolor is identical to that of module  <dig>  in order to verify that this was indeed the case, regions of the adenylation domains of s. lividans cdaps modules  <dig>   <dig> &  <dig> spanning the 'missing' probe were amplified by pcr using specific primer pairs whose sequences are based on the published s. coelicolor m <dig> genome sequence . the sequences of the cloned pcr products  show that the sequence of the s. lividans  <dig> module  <dig> and module  <dig> differ from the s. coelicolor probe sequence by a three bp deletion which is flanked by regions containing eleven base mismatches. these results indicate that modules  <dig> and  <dig> of s. lividans  <dig> contain sequences which are identical to that of s. lividans  <dig> and s. coelicolor module  <dig>  and are different from s. coelicolor modules  <dig> &  <dig>  it is likely that the sequence differences between the species derive from recombination events between the three asp modules in s. lividans  <dig> resulting in the module  <dig> &  <dig> sequences being replaced by the corresponding sequence from module  <dig>  however, a close examination of longer sequences of modules  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> indicates that, relative to the s. coelicolor sequences, the three modules of s. lividans are 'shuffled' and each s. lividans module contains specific nucleotides/motifs characteristic of all three s. coelicolor asp modules . this data suggests a long history of recombination events between these three asp modules, although due to the high levels of similarity between them, identification of cross-over sites has proved elusive. it is significant that the sequences encoding the active site residues which determine the specificity of modules  <dig>   <dig> &  <dig> for aspartate has been conserved  <cit>  even though there has been recombination within the modules; this is consistent with the aspartate residues being essential for cda activity as they are responsible for the binding of a ca2+ ion  <cit> .

investigation of a single non-binding probe in the actinorhodin gene cluster
from a preliminary, trial array used in our array testing and optimization process  we identified a non-binding probe corresponding to positions 5524009- <dig> of the s. coelicolor chromosome, i.e. a region located in between genes sco <dig> and sco <dig> of the actinorhodin biosynthetic cluster, which encode the actii- <dig> transcriptional regulator and actii- <dig> actinorhodin transporter proteins respectively. sequence determination of a pcr product amplified using primers actdell and actdelr  spanning the corresponding region of the s. lividans  <dig> chromosome generated the sequence shown in additional file  <dig>  which differs from the s. coelicolor probe sequence by seven nucleotides, including three consecutive nucleotide mismatches. it may be that these sequence differences, which are located in the divergent promoter region of sco5082- <dig>  are at least partly responsible for the differences in actinorhodin production between s. coelicolor and s. lividans, although it is clear that other factors are involved in actinorhodin production/regulation .

the above results illustrate the sensitivity of the experimentally optimised 60-mer probe set in discriminating relatively small differences in nucleotide sequence.

establishment of the "region of difference" calling criterion for gene presence/absence
the above studies demonstrate the high specificity of our microarray design, indicating that single non-binding probes can represent genuine genomic differences between strains. in addition to providing detection of small sequence differences and microdissection of individual gene structure our results provide a macroscopic overview of genome content in s. lividans.

in a previous comparative study of s. lividans tk <dig> against s. coelicolor m <dig> jayapal and co-workers  <cit>  used a  <dig>  probe spotted pcr array, where each gene is targeted by one probe. they used a criterion that three consecutive probe targeting genes need to be classified as divergent/absent before being assigned as absent. in analogy to their criterion, our presence/absence calling criterion is based on a relative loss of signal from a minimum of three consecutive 60-mer probes, which define a 'region of difference'. figure  <dig> illustrates how the pattern of probe binding may be used to characterize 'regions of difference'. genes are classified as 'absent' if their annotated translational start site  is encompassed by a region satisfying the 'region of difference/absence' criterion. we believe that this analysis represents a conservative view of the number of absent/divergent genes, as, for example, it would assign 3" truncated non-functional genes as present. this situation is illustrated in figure 3a: sco <dig> is not classified as absent/divergent despite it containing a 'region of difference' comprising  <dig> non-binding probes in both s. lividans strains as its translational start site is not encompassed within this region. the converse situation also occurs where our calling criterion classifies genes whose 5' terminus lies within a "region of difference" as "absent". for example, we classify sco <dig>  as being absent/divergent in s. lividans tk <dig>  it is clear from the gack classification of probe absences  that sco <dig> is largely intact/present, as of the  <dig> probes targeting this gene all but three are present/non-divergent, i.e. only the first probe targeting the 5' terminus and the two probes targeting the 3' terminus do not bind. however, significantly, as a run of more than three consecutive non binding probes, comprising the first probe within the gene, extends into sco <dig> from upstream so encompassing the translational start site of the gene within a 'region of difference', the gene is classified as absent/divergent according to the microarray data. however, the results of our reciprocal blast search  indicated that sco <dig> is present in s. lividans tk <dig> and diverges only from the s. coelicolor gene sequence at the 5' and 3' termini in a pattern consistent with that of the microarray probe-binding .

genes classified as absent/divergent from both s. lividans  <dig> and tk <dig>  and uniquely from tk <dig> are given, respectively, in additional files  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the criterion used in this study represents a significant advance in terms of increase in resolution of interspecies genomic differences over the previous amplicon-based cgh study  <cit> . furthermore, the present study identifies differences between the intergenic regions of s. coelicolor and s. lividans which have not been previously investigated.

from figure  <dig> it is apparent that s. lividans  <dig> shares the vast majority of its genome with s. coelicolor a <dig>  we have identified  <dig>  and  <dig>  probe differences between s. lividans  <dig> and s. lividans tk <dig> and s. coelicolor m <dig>  respectively. these include  <dig> single probe absences and  <dig> double probe absences for s. lividans  <dig> relative to s. coelicolor m <dig>  and  <dig> single probe and  <dig> double probe absences for s. lividans tk <dig>  relative to s. coelicolor m <dig>  respectively. according to our calling criterion these probe absences do not contribute towards assigning genes as present/absent. when our calling criterion was applied to the remaining absent probes which are present in consecutive runs of three or more we identify  <dig> 'regions of difference' between s. lividans  <dig> and s. coelicolor m <dig>  which encompass  <dig> absent/divergent genes, and  <dig> 'regions of difference' between s. lividans tk <dig> and s. coelicolor, encompassing  <dig> absent/divergent genes. the distribution of these 'regions of difference' across the s. lividans  <dig> and tk <dig> chromosomes is shown schematically in figure  <dig> .

we note that there are 'regions of difference' which do not appear to correlate with absent/divergent protein coding genes. the absence/divergence of these regions may however prove to be significant as these regions may encompass promoter elements and rna genes, including, for example at present unidentified/uncharacterized cis- or trans-encoded non-coding rnas.

comparison of the s. lividans tk <dig> microarray results with the results of blast search
the broad institute  are currently in the process of annotating the sequence of s. lividans tk <dig> and the sequence data are available for blast search via their website  <cit> . as a test of our calling criteria we performed a reciprocal blast search  between the s. coelicolor m <dig> and s. lividans tk <dig> genes; the results are presented in figure  <dig>  both the microarray and blast results find  <dig> genes to be absent/divergent in s. lividans tk <dig> relative to s. coelicolor m <dig>  however,  <dig> genes are classified as absent/divergent from the microarray data but are present according to the blast results. one possible explanation for these results may be due to the difference in discrimination of the techniques employed. for families of very similar/identical genes the blast search may have identified absent/divergent genes as present through targeting their similar family members, whereas the microarray probes, which are designed to be specific for each gene, give a more accurate indication of presence/absence. in this regard it is worth noting that many of the genes classed as present/non divergent according to the reciprocal blast results  are transposase genes which give multiple hits when 'blasted' against the s. coelicolor m <dig> genome; transposase genes that give smaller numbers of blast hits are comprised within the  <dig> genes identified as absent/divergent by both the microarray analysis and reciprocal blast search. an example illustrating the differences in specificity of the microarray probes and blast search is the case of sco <dig>  which appears from the pattern of microarray probe-binding  to be absent/divergent from s. lividans tk <dig> but which the reciprocal blast search  classifies as present/non divergent.

from the annotated  <dig>  protein encoding genes in the s. coelicolor genome, the blast analysis identifies  <dig> genes as missing and  <dig>  as present in s. lividans tk <dig>  from the array analysis of s. lividans tk <dig> versus s. coelicolor m <dig> we identify  <dig> genes as missing and  <dig>  as present.  <dig> genes were found to be missing by the array analysis but found to be present by blast, whilst  <dig> genes were found to be present by the array analysis but missing by blast.

if we classify genes identified as present by the reciprocal blast as true positives  and the number of genes mis-identified  by the array classed as false negatives  then the sensitivity can be calculated by tp/tp+fn. thus the sensitivity of the arrays and calling method is 7047/7047+120: 98%. if we class genes identified as absent by the reciprocal blast as true negatives  and the number of genes mis-identified  by the array classed as false positives  then the specificity can be calculated by tn/tn+fp. thus the specificity of the arrays and calling method is 498/498+159: 78%. the overall accuracy  of the arrays and calling method for cgh purposes is 96%.

macroscopic pattern of gene absence/divergence in s. lividans  <dig> and tk <dig> and comparision to s. lividans tk <dig> and s. coelicolor m145
previous studies  <cit>  have categorized regions of difference based on size as either genomic islands   or as smaller genomic islets , which although smaller than  <dig> kb contain at least three consecutive genes  <cit> . the use of this "archipelago" model is understandable given the technical limitations of earlier microarray technologies and the gene absence/presence calling criterion, which tended to bias the analysis towards identifying blocks of consecutive absent genes. analysis of the s. coelicolor m <dig> genome sequence identified a series of regions designated as potentially recently laterally acquired  <cit>  which are broadly consistent with clusters of genes identified by jayapal and co-workers as absent/divergent. however, the increased resolution of the genomic differences between the species that the 104k microarray of the present study affords has allowed us to identify a more subtle and complicated pattern of differences, so the 'archipelago' model approach was not employed in our study.

it is clear from figure  <dig> that the identified 'regions of difference' are not evenly distributed along the s. lividans  <dig> and tk <dig> chromosomes. in common with previous studies  <cit>  we note that certain regions containing trna genes and integrated copies of the s. ambofaciens plasmid psam <dig> homologues are hotspots for gene absence/divergence, due to recombinogenic activity. however, our results lead us to propose that rather than being strictly confined to these isolated areas, gene deletion/divergence occurs more widely throughout the s. lividans chromosome than previously thought. it appears that in both s. lividans strains, "regions of difference" and single and double absent probes are distributed throughout the genome, with a slight tendency to occur in the "core" region  as previously defined by  <cit> . both s. lividans strains  <dig> and tk <dig> possess significant deletions at the chromosome termini, which is consistent with previous observations regarding s. lividans tk <dig> and s. coelicolor m <dig>  and with other studies reported in the literature  <cit> , reporting that the terminal regions of streptomycete genomes are more prone to deletion, duplication and recombination events. evaluation of the % g+c content of the genes identified as absent/divergent in the present study indicates that they are unusually a+t rich, when compared with the entire genome . moreover, the codon adaption index  indicates the absent/divergent genes have a low score and possess non-optimum codon usage . both of these measures suggest that many of the apparently absent/divergent genes identified in s. lividans strains have in fact been recently acquired by s. coelicolor and our results are consistent with the results of previous studies in this respect  <cit> .

our results are broadly consistent with the findings reported by jayapal et al  <cit>  in that the majority of genes absent in s. lividans  <dig> and tk <dig> are present in the gi's and gi's of tk <dig> defined previously. in some cases our results correlate exactly with previous results, particularly when considering the smaller genomic islets . for example, s. lividans tk <dig> possesses blocks of absent genes which match gi- <dig>  , gi- <dig>  , gi- <dig> , gi- <dig> , gi- <dig> , gi- <dig> , gi- <dig>  and the right end terminal deletion  of s. lividans tk <dig> exactly. figure 3b illustrates gi- <dig> in s. lividans  <dig>  similarly, s. lividans  <dig> possesses blocks of absent genes which match gi- <dig>  gi- <dig>  gi- <dig> , gi <dig>  and gi- <dig> 

however, there are also significant differences between our results and those reported previously  <cit> , and in many cases these correspond to regions where our results do not provide evidence for the complete absence of large blocks of genes. instead, we are able to classify at least one gene, and in some cases many more, within most of the gi/gi's identified previously  <cit>  as being present, raising doubt as to the gi/gi's boundaries and in some cases the very existence of a gi/gi at all. for example, gi- <dig> is reported as an absence of sco3929-sco <dig>  <cit>  whereas we find that in both s. lividans tk <dig> and  <dig> that sco <dig> is classed as present. additionally, gi- <dig> was reported to lack sco2381- <dig> whereas we find that sco <dig> is present in both tk <dig> and  <dig>  moreover, gi- <dig> is defined as an absence of sco0090- <dig>  <cit>  whereas in tk <dig> we find only sco0090- <dig> and sco <dig> are absent, and in s. lividans  <dig> only a single gene sco <dig> is absent. furthermore, out of the  <dig> missing genes  defined as gi- <dig>  we find that tk <dig> has  <dig> missing genes, but significantly s. lividans  <dig> only has  <dig> missing. hence, due to the methods employed in this study we have succeeded in identifying many single genes, and small blocks of genes, located in between genomic islands/islets as absent/divergent. for example, we assign three consecutive secreted protein genes  and the isolated secreted protein gene sco <dig> as absent in both s. lividans  <dig> and tk <dig>  we also assign sco3521- <dig>  encoding an integral membrane protein and a transcriptional regulator respectively, as absent in tk <dig> only.

it is interesting to note that the patterns of gene absence/divergence relative to s. coelicolor m <dig> differ in all three s. lividans strains so far investigated. the results are summarized in the venn diagram shown in figure  <dig> and indicate that whilst there appears to be a core of  <dig> absent genes common to all three strains there are also gene differences unique to one particular strain, or are shared between only two of them. this is consistent with the fact that although tk <dig> and tk <dig> were generated from s. lividans  <dig>  in the same study, they were generated in parallel  <cit> . it is likely that although some of the differences between tk <dig> and the other strains may be due to differences in the microarray platform employed and data analysis methodology used, these factors cannot account for the significant differences identified between s. lividans  <dig> and tk <dig>  it appears, prima facie, that tk <dig> and tk <dig> share more similar patterns of gene loss/divergence than do tk <dig> and  <dig>  or tk <dig> and  <dig>  tk <dig> and  <dig> have lost  <dig> genes relative to s. coelicolor m <dig> that were misclassified as present in tk <dig> from the previous lower resolution study  <cit> . collectively, tk <dig> and tk <dig> lack  <dig> genes relative to the parent strain, s. lividans  <dig> and some of these differences in gene loss might be attributed to the differences in plasmid profiles of the strains. cgh studies do not distinguish between chromosomal genes and those that are plasmid-located and can only inform as to their presence/absence. this being so it may be that loss of slp <dig> from tk <dig> and tk <dig> explains some of the  <dig> absent genes common to these strains, which are present in s. lividans  <dig>  and the further loss of slp <dig> by tk <dig> the additional  <dig> genes it has lost relative to the other strains. furthermore, plasmids may have acquired chromosomal genes singly or in small blocks during repeated recombination events. it has long been known that slp <dig> is able to mediate chromosomal recombination events  <cit>  and that the rightmost  <dig>  kb of slp <dig> is identical to sequence from the s. lividans chromosome from which it is thought to have been recently acquired  <cit> , probably by recombination occurring between the slp <dig> and chromosomal copies of tn <dig>  <cit> . it has also been suggested that slp <dig> is able to integrate into the s. lividans chromosome as curing of the plasmid has also resulted in deletion of chromosomal dna  <cit> .

consideration of the absent divergent genes in s. lividans  <dig> and tk24
the lists of genes which are absent/divergent and are common to s. lividans  <dig> and tk <dig>  and are specific to tk <dig>  are listed in additional files  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  hypothetical genes and pseudogenes account for approximately 50% of the genetic differences between s. lividans  <dig>  s. lividans tk <dig>  and s. coelicolor m <dig>  it is clear from the gene annotations and co-localization pattern that a number of genes lost are from integrated plasmids of the psam <dig> family from s. ambofaciens. for example, genes sco3250- <dig> and sco5336- <dig> represent integrated plasmids similar to psam <dig> from which the three s. lividans strains have lost genes.

other classes of genes well represented in the absent/divergent lists include transposases, and "orphan" membrane proteins, secreted proteins, transcription regulators, unspecified regulator and transporter proteins, lipoproteins, dna-binding proteins, and atp-binding proteins. until such time as the precise functions of these genes are understood we are unable to explain or predict reasons for phenotypic differences between s. coelicolor and the s. lividans strains. therefore, the main interest of the available datasets lies in the absent/divergent genes of s. lividans whose functional annotations are sufficiently detailed to be useful in hypothesis/prediction generation, i.e. mainly the enzymes.

the differences between the genetic complement of s. lividans tk <dig> and s. coelicolor m <dig> have been discussed elsewhere and we do not intend to reiterate the results of the previous analysis  <cit>  and in view of their current annotations we are unable to usefully comment on the significance of the  <dig> absent/divergent genes specific to tk <dig>  of the  <dig> gene differences found in tk <dig> but not found in s. lividans  <dig> and tk <dig>  only three are enzymes and only one  possesses useful functional annotation, being a putative  <dig> hydroxyacyl-coa dehydrogenase. however, tk <dig> also differs significantly from the other s. lividans strains in lacking the Ï†c <dig> phage resistance gene pglz , although it and tk <dig> both lack the Ï†c <dig> phage resistance gene pgly . both of these genes are present in s. lividans  <dig> 

the differences in act biosynthesis between s. lividans and s. coelicolor may be due to absence/divergence of genes relating to s-adenosylmethionine
among the more intriguing of the apparently missing genes in the s. lividans strains are those which are either involved in the biosynthesis of methionine or are s-adenosylmethionine -dependent methyltransferases. the indirect involvement of genes possessing these functions in differentiation and antibiotic production has previously been noted  <cit> . elevated concentrations of sam have been shown to lead to expression of actii-orf <dig> and subsequent overexpression of actinorhodin biosynthesis in s. lividans tk <dig>  <cit> , overexpression of undecylprodiginine in s. coelicolor  <cit>  and inhibition of sporulation in s. lividans  <cit> . sam has been shown to mediate its effect on sporulation through induction of bldk expression  <cit> , in addition to other abc transporters involved in development  <cit> , and possibly through modulation of blda expression  <cit> . we note that the genes identified as missing in s. lividans  <dig> and tk <dig> in the present study include sco <dig>  and the methyltransferase genes sco <dig>  and sco <dig> . it may be significant that both absent methyltransferase genes possess sequence similarity to sam-dependent methyltransferases. whilst we do not propose a direct and precise mechanism by which loss of sco <dig>  sco <dig> and sco <dig> mediate the differences in antibiotic production and differentiation between s. coelicolor and s. lividans the roles we hypothesize for these genes and their effect on development and secondary metabolite biosynthesis relate to their effect on sam concentration. this hypothesis is consistent with them playing roles similar to those outlined previously with regard to mutagenesis of the methionine synthase, meth, and a sam dependent methyltransferase, sco <dig>  <cit> .

investigation on sequence differences in s.coelicolor and s. lividans bldb
although it is instructive to compare the macrosequence differences between the two s. lividans strains, and s. coelicolor much of the interest of the present dataset lies in the fine detail afforded by the high density coverage of the genomes, as exemplified above in the case of the cda asp-activating adenylation domains. a further example of the use of the dataset in microsequence analysis relates to the bldb gene . this gene encodes a small  protein required for morphogenesis, antibiotic production and catabolite control in s. coelicolor  <cit> . s. lividans tk <dig> apparently lacks this gene  <cit>  and in the present study we find it is classified as absent/divergent in s. lividans  <dig> and tk <dig>  a bldb homologue has long been known in s. lividans tk <dig>  <cit> , its sequence has been determined  and it is well known that s. lividans sporulates readily and does not exhibit the severe bldb deletant mutant phenotype observed in s. coelicolor mutants  <cit> . bldb null mutants have a "bald" phenotype when grown on all carbon sources and fail to produce aerial hyphae or antibiotics under any tested conditions  <cit> . in contrast to  <cit>  we accept that s. lividans does in fact possess bldb and attribute its apparent absence in microarray studies to technical reasons relating to positioning of probe design and the pattern of sequence similarity between the s. coelicolor and s. lividans genes across their sequences . it seems that the pcr product used by jayapal et al  <cit>  spanning the entire tk <dig> bldb sequence was unable to bind to its target. in our microarrays the probes located 5" of bldb and the probe encompassing the 5" terminus  were not bound in s. lividans  <dig> or tk <dig>  and of the three remaining probes directly, or partially targeting, bldb on our microarray three bound successfully to the 3' terminus of bldb in s. lividans  <dig> and two bound successfully to tk <dig> genomic dna . thus, in both s. lividans  <dig> and tk <dig> the presence of three consecutive absent probes encompassing the translational start means that bldb is classed as absent/divergent when in fact it is present but possesses sequence sufficiently divergent from the s. coelicolor homologue in the 5" region to prevent hybridization. when the sequences of pcr products generated from both s. lividans strains using primers slbldbup and slbldbdown  were determined, both were found to be identical to the published s. lividans bldb sequence  and the tk <dig> bldb sequence identified by blast search of the broad institute database, showing that the bldb gene is indeed present in both s. lividans strains as well as in s. coelicolor.

investigation on metabolic differences between s. coelicolor and s. lividans and alternative mechanisms in s. lividans strains
flux balance analysis  of genome scale metabolic reaction networks  has been widely used to predict metabolic capabilities of microbial strains, metabolic engineering of overproducing strains, prediction of essential genes and integration of high throughput data with the literature knowledge on metabolic reactions  <cit> . here we have used fba in combination with our cgh data to identify system-level differences in global metabolic flux distribution between s. coelicolor and s. lividans, and have modified the existing s. coelicolor gsmn accordingly and then tested our predictions relating to differences in cell physiology and c <dig> metabolism between the species.

the published gsmn model of streptomyces coelicolor  <cit>  was the starting point of our studies. the following nine metabolic genes which are included in the gsmn model were shown to be absent from the s. lividans  <dig> genome by our cgh: sco <dig>  sco <dig>  sco <dig>  sco <dig>  sco <dig>  sco <dig>  sco <dig>  sco <dig> & sco <dig>  subsequently, we identified all reactions, which require products of these genes and have removed them from the s. coelicolor gsmn model . we checked whether the resulting model is feasible i.e. whether it reproduces the growth of s. lividans strains on a typical glucose-based minimal medium and then ran simulations of the maximal flux towards reactions representing biomass synthesis. this modified model, referred to here as the s. lividans gsmn, predicted that the metabolic network is capable of biomass synthesis.

reactions from the model of borodina et. al.  <cit>  requiring products of genes classified as missing in s. lividans  <dig> and tk <dig> according to cgh data. reaction ids and metabolite names are set according to the model of  <cit> ; full names of metabolites can be found in  <cit> .

perhaps the genes most fundamental to core metabolic activities which the present study identifies as absent in s. lividans are those which encode isocitrate lyase  and malate synthase , which are both involved in the glyoxylate bypass mechanism. this is a key system for the utilisation of compounds, such as fatty acids or acetate, which enter central metabolism at the level of acetyl-coa. this mechanism involves the condensation of acetyl-coa and oxaloacetate to form citrate, which is isomerized to isocitrate, which can in turn either be decarboxylated to form Î±-ketoglutarate in the tca cycle or which can be cleaved by isocitrate lyase  to yield succinate and glyoxylate. malate synthase  is able to condense acetyl-coa and glyoxylate to generate malate and coa. thus icl and ms, together with enzymes from the krebs cycle, catalyse the net formation of succinyl-coa from two molecules of acetyl-coa. there is little published evidence for the expression of the glyoxylate bypass enzymes in streptomyces species and it is well known that the glyoxylate bypass is not the sole mechanism by which c <dig> units may enter streptomyces central metabolism  <cit> . although s. cinnamonensis possesses icl and ms genes extracts from cells grown in oil-based media have been shown not to possess icl activity  <cit>  and s. collinus has only been shown to possess icl activity when grown in the presence of tween, but not in acetate  <cit> . we note that an isoform of malate synthase  is present in both s. lividans  <dig> and tk <dig> and that reaction r <dig> may be catalyzed by this enzyme. however, as both strains lack icl the strains must necessarily be deficient in the glyoxylate bypass.

we have used the s. coelicolor and s. lividans models to make predictions about the growth of both species on medium comprising palmitate as the sole carbon source. simulations of maximal biomass synthesis rate predicted that s. coelicolor is able, and s. lividans is not able, to use palmitate as a sole carbon source . this contradicted previously published experimental data indicating that s. lividans tk <dig> is capable of growth in media comprising triacylglycerides or oleic acid as sole carbon source  <cit>  in addition to our own observations which demonstrate that s. lividans  <dig> and tk <dig> are capable of growth in minimal media where the sole carbon sources are tween  <dig> or palmitic acid . the apparent non-essentiality of the glyoxylate bypass enzymes may be explained by the presence of an alternative metabolic pathway. a number of possible alternatives for c <dig> metabolism to the glyoxylate bypass mechanisms have been suggested, although they have not been fully characterized/confirmed  <cit> . however, the recently identified ethylmalonyl-coa pathway  <cit>  is the most likely candidate mechanism which operates as an alternative to the glyoxylate shunt in s. lividans; indeed, this pathway has recently been shown to operate in s. coelicolor .

CONCLUSIONS
the results presented here provide a powerful demonstration of the application of high-density microarrays to cgh studies. as shown here high-density ijiss arrays are capable of distinguishing between extremely similar sequences allowing specific discrimination on the basis of as few as three nucleotide mismatches.

the results presented here regarding single probe absences provide evidence for recombination between the aspartate-specific adenylation domain modules  of the cdaps genes of the cda biosynthetic gene cluster revealing them to be "mosaic" genes, relative to the corresponding s. coelicolor sequences. we also identify an intergenic sequence divergence from s. coelicolor in the actinorhodin biosynthetic gene cluster and suggest that this, and/or the differences in the s. lividans complement of genes involved in sam biosynthesis, or sam-dependent methytransferases, may be involved in mediating the phenotypic differences in actinorhodin production between s. coelicolor and s. lividans.

taking a broader view, the results indicate that the pattern of genetic differences between s. lividans  <dig> and tk <dig> are different to those of s. coelicolor m <dig> and s. lividans tk <dig>  we propose that more widespread genetic drift and recombination has occurred in s. lividans than the "archipelago model" developed previously, suggests .

in a series of case studies we confirm that the pattern of probe binding to s. lividans genes correlates with their sequence differences relative to s. coelicolor and use this to explain the published contradictory results previously reported for s. lividans bldb.

we have developed a gsmn for s. lividans taking into account the genetic differences relating to the differences in central metabolism between s. lividans  <dig> and s. coelicolor, including the absence of genes encoding the enzymes of the glyoxylate bypass-isocitrate lyase and malate synthase. the fact that the gsmn indicated that both s. lividans strains should not be able to grow on fatty acids as sole carbon source, so contradicting the literature, suggests an alternative pathway to the glyoxylate shunt exists in s. lividans and it is likely that the hypothesized ethylmalonyl-coa pathway fulfils this role.

it is clear from the case studies presented here regarding bldb and the genes which encode the glyoxylate bypass enzymes that the microarray data presented here has enormous potential to explain previously published observations and inform new hypotheses. we note that observations published in the previous study  <cit>  regarding the putative identification of genes involved in dna methylation systems of s. lividans have stimulated and informed further studies into this phenomenon  <cit> . we expect that the present, more extensive and detailed study will do likewise.

finally, we envisage that these high-density arrays will find widespread application for rapid assessment of genome content in mutational studies of s. coelicolor and related species. it is well known that streptomycetes generally display high genetic instability and second-site mutations can arise frequently in the s. coelicolor genome when conducting targeted mutagenesis studies . the 104k array provides an efficient tool for comparing a new mutant with its immediate parent, to allow identification of mutants that have acquired additional, unwanted, deletions/duplications  and hence exclude them from further study.
