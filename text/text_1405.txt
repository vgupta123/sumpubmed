BACKGROUND
we have previously described a complex developmental phenotype in mice bearing a homozygous ethylnitrosourea-induced mutation  or a conditional epiblastic knockout of the gene encoding the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type  <dig> - pcsk <dig>  <cit> . no phenotypic abnormalities were observed in heterozygous mice. components of the homozygous or epiblastic knockout mutant phenotype included cardiac malformations such as dextrocardia, atrial and ventricular septal defects , common arterial trunk , vascular ring, right-aortic arch and hypoplastic arterial duct. such lesions are characteristic for human congenital heart disease   <cit>  – a gross structural abnormality of the heart or intrathoracic great vessels that is present at birth and is of functional significance  <cit> . pcsk <dig> mutation also resulted in non-cardiac defects commonly associated with chd: antero-posterior patterning defects, tracheo-esophageal and anorectal malformations, presacral mass, absent tail, sacral agenesis, increased numbers of thoracic vertebrae and true ribs, hypoplastic hind limbs, renal and palatal agenesis, and pulmonary hypoplasia. together with chd-like malformations, this phenotype closely resembles human vacterl/caudal regression/currarino syndrome-like malformations . we  <cit>  and others  <cit>  have found heterozygous mutations in conserved residues in pcsk <dig> in patients with vacterl syndrome that are transmitted from phenotypically normal parents, suggesting that other genetic or epigenetic factors that interact with pcsk <dig> are likely responsible for the development of the disease.

pcsk <dig> is a member of the subtilisin-like proprotein convertase family that mediates pro-domain cleavage and activation of tgfβ/bmp-family members   <cit> . pcsk <dig> is expressed in extraembryonic lineages in the mouse at embryonic day   <dig>   <cit> , and then expression initiates in the anterior mesoderm of the embryo at around e <dig> , just before the cardiac crescent is formed  <cit> . at e <dig>  pcsk <dig> is expressed in the somites, bulb of umbilical cord and lung buds  <cit> . we have previously shown, using whole mount in situ hybridisation at e <dig> , that pcsk <dig> is present in the somites and limb buds but we did not observe it in the heart or outflow tract  <cit> . using a more sensitive radioactive in situ hybridisation method, we have shown previously that at e <dig> -e <dig>  pcsk <dig> is, indeed, weakly expressed in the bulbus cordis  <cit> . we have previously shown that deletion of pcsk <dig>  led, respectively, to pre-natal or early embryonic lethality  <cit> . by characterizing the vcc and conditional epiblastic Δ <dig> mutations, we showed that pcsk <dig> functions to cleave and activate gdf <dig> , and thus regulates caudal hox paralogs  to control anorectal, renal, and caudal skeletal development  <cit> . the presence of cardiac abnormalities in the vcc and conditional epiblastic Δ <dig> mutations indicated that pcsk <dig> is essential for heart development, but these studies did not address the exact spatio-temporal requirements of this enzyme during cardiogenesis. cardiac malformations arise from defects in progenitor cell specialisation, or abnormal patterning during development. the heart, although induced by endodermal signals, is essentially mesodermal in origin, with a minor contribution from the ectodermal neural crest  <cit> . these three embryonic lineages arise from the epiblast  <cit> . following gastrulation, mesodermal progenitors migrate anteriorly to form two closely appositioned primary and secondary heart fields  . these cells specialize into cardiomyocyte, endothelial and epicardial lineages that form the heart. neural crest cells differentiate into the mesenchyme of the great arteries and transiently contribute to the outflow tract  and aorticopulmonary septa  <cit> . left-right patterning also plays a key role in creating a 4-chambered heart  <cit> . the heart tube is initially linear , with venous tributaries draining into the developing atria at the posterior or inflow end, and connecting to the ventral aorta at its anterior or outflow end. the initially symmetrical atria subsequently develop distinct left-right identities. the heart tube undergoes dextral looping beginning e <dig>  and remodelling between e <dig> – <dig> , processes that are necessary to position the developing atria cranial to the ventricles, and to connect the left and right atria to the respective ventricles  <cit> . the aorta, carotid and pulmonary arteries arise by remodelling of the initially bilateral pharyngeal arterial arch system, beginning at e <dig>   <cit> . by e <dig> , major structures of mouse embryonic heart are fully developed; maturation of ventricular and atrial septa, separation of outflow tract and cardiac valve formation is completed  <cit> . to explore further the role of pcsk <dig> during heart development, we employed a conditional knockout approach to ablate pcsk <dig> from cardiogenic lineages. we show that conditional deletion of pcsk <dig> in the early cranio-cardiac mesoderm affects heart development but that conditional deletion in the neural crest or in the pharyngeal arches, or in nkx <dig> -expressing cardiac progenitors does not affect heart development.

methods
mice and generation of embryos
all animal procedures were approved by the committee for animal care and ethical review at the university of oxford, and all the experiments conformed to the uk animals  act,  <dig>  incorporating directive 2010/63/eu of the european parliament. mice were housed in groups, in specific pathogen-free cages under a 12 h light-dark cycle, at 21–22 °c, with chow and drinking water available ad libitum . mice with pcsk <dig> alleles pcsk5

flox/flox females. pregnant dams were killed by cervical dislocation and the embryos were dissected and processed for further analyses as described below. genotyping was performed using polymerase chain reaction with allele-specific primers  on dna isolated from embryonic forelimbs or from sections of cardiac tissue.

magnetic resonance imaging 
embryos were dissected at indicated time-points and mri was performed and data analysed as described previously  <cit> .

histology
embryos were dissected into cold pbs  at various developmental stages and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. histological sections and hematoxylin–eosin staining were performed as described previously  <cit> .

in situ hybridization

in situ hybridization was performed using a digoxigenin-labeled antisense probe as described previously  <cit> .

RESULTS
pcsk <dig> expression in early murine embryos
to further characterize the expression of pcsk <dig> we used whole mount in situ hybridisation. we find while pcsk <dig> is expressed in the presomitic mesoderm and first forming somites at e <dig>  , it is not seen in the forming heart tube. pcsk <dig> is also detected in the pharyngeal arches at e <dig>  . taken together with published data this suggests that with regard to heart, outflow tract and aortic arch development, pcsk <dig> could have either an early role in the developing mesoderm, or a later role in the bulbus cordis  or the pharyngeal arches.fig.  <dig>

pcsk <dig> Δ <dig> knock-out embryos recapitulate completely the vcc mutation
we used magnetic resonance imaging  to analyse pcsk5
Δ1/Δ <dig> knock-out embryos at e <dig> . screening embryos at this developmental stage allows the observation of cardiac malformations that are typical of human congenital heart disease. we imaged  <dig> pcsk5
Δ1/Δ <dig>   <dig> heterozygous  and  <dig> wild-type embryos . all four pcsk5
Δ1/Δ <dig> embryos had reduced body size, caudal regression evidenced by hind limb dysplasia and absent tail, visceral anomalies including exomphalos, absent kidneys, neural presacral mass, hypoplastic lungs, tracheo-esophageal fusion, and cardiac malformations. these included ventricular and atrial septal defects, abnormal atrio-ventricular junction, common arterial trunk, and right-sided aortic arch. these abnormalities were not found in heterozygous and wild-type littermates . thus the pcsk5
Δ1/Δ <dig> knock-out fully recapitulates the vcc mutant allele.table  <dig> developmental anomalies identified by mri in pcsk <dig> zygotic and conditional knock-out embryos at e <dig>

epiblast deletion of pcsk <dig> almost completely recapitulates the zygotic mutant  <cit>  phenotype
cardiac developmental malformations can result from abnormalities in extra-embryonic lineages that affect placental development  <cit> . to distinguish the role of pcsk <dig> in the extraembryonic versus embryonic lineages we have previously reported epiblastic deletion of pcsk <dig> with meox2cre, and found that this recapitulated all developmental malformations but with reduced penetrance  <cit> . we therefore used a sox2cre driver that also deletes mainly in the epiblast  <cit>   to explore if a different driver would affect penetrance. although sox <dig> is expressed in the trophoblast extraembryonic lineage  <cit> , reports show, that sox2cre-dependent deletion does not significantly affect extraembryonic tissues  <cit> . we generated and analysed five pcsk5

conditional deletion of pcsk <dig> in early cranio-cardiac mesoderm recapitulates cardiac anomalies observed in the zygotic mutations
we next wished to determine the role of pcsk <dig> in mesodermal lineages that contribute to the heart, and we initially used a mesp1cre driver to investigate this. mesp1cre deletes in the extraembryonic and lateral mesoderm at the onset of gastrulation, at ~ e <dig>   <cit>  . lateral mesodermal cells migrate through a primitive streak to the most anterior end of the embryo to become an anterior mesoderm that includes early cranio-cardiac and pharyngeal arch mesoderm  <cit> . as evidenced by lineage tracing, this cell population contributes mainly to the mesoderm of the developing heart: myo-, endo- and epicardium  <cit> , cranial mesoderm-derived structures, like the muscles of the tongue, jaws and neck, and oesophagus  <cit> . other mesodermal lineages, paraxial , axial  and intermediate  are not affected by the mesp1-driven cre recombination  <cit> . we analysed six pcsk5
Δ1/flox
; mesp1cre
+ experimental embryos and six pcsk5
wt/flox
; mesp1cre
+ control littermates. we observed atrial and ventricular septal defects, abnormal atrio-ventricular junction, double outlet right ventricle and transposition of great arteries in pcsk5
Δ1/flox
; mesp1cre
+ embryos . consistent with lack of deletion in paraxial, axial and intermediate mesoderm, there was no evidence of caudal regression, renal agenesis, or hindgut abnormalities. all control littermates were normal. these results showed that pcsk <dig> is required in the cranio-cardiac mesoderm for the development of the heart.fig.  <dig> cardiovascular anomalies in the  <dig> dpc embryos with the mesp1cre-driven deletion of pcsk <dig>   three-dimensional reconstruction of a control  heart. left and right ventricles  are separated by ventricular septum ; the aorta  arises from the left ventricle and forms the arch on the left side of the trachea . pulmonary artery  leaves from the right ventricle.  corresponding views of the two representative abnormal hearts .  transposition of great arteries: aorta arises from the right, and pulmonary artery – from the left ventricle.  ventricular septal defect  and double outlet right ventricle : both great arteries arise from the right ventricle.  mri section through the control heart. the mitral valve  is formed between the left ventricle  and the left atrium . atrial septum  separates left and right atria .  corresponding sections through the heart of the psck5

pcsk <dig> is not required in the nkx <dig>  expressing mesodermal lineage for cardiac or great vessel development
we next investigated the role of pcsk <dig> more specifically in cardiac progenitor lineages. to do this we used the nkx <dig> cre driver  <cit> . this activates expression of cre recombinase in the myocardial precursors of primary and secondary heart fields, with target floxed gene recombination effectively starting at embryonic day e <dig>   <cit>  . in addition, nkx <dig> cre drives recombination also in the endoderm and ectoderm of the first pharyngeal arch  <cit> . fate mapping shows that nkx <dig> cre effectively deletes in the progenitor cells that contribute to myocardium, to coronary, chamber, and valve endothelium, to smooth muscle cells of the aorta and coronary arteries, to proepicardium and, subsequently, to coronary vasculature  <cit> . in keeping with this, nkx <dig> cre-driven deletion of fgf <dig> results in a truncated heart tube and pharyngeal arch hypoplasia  <cit> , and bmp <dig>  deletion leads to conotruncal and atrioventricular septation defects and anomalies in the branching of branchial arch arteries  <cit> . to explore the role of pcsk <dig> in the nkx <dig> -expressing lineage, we studied six pcsk5
Δ1/flox
; nkx <dig> cre
+ and six pcsk5
wt/flox
; nkx <dig> cre
+ control embryos. surprisingly, no cardiac, outflow tract or pharyngeal arch malformations were observed . to investigate if nkx <dig> cre was deleting pcsk <dig> from cardiac tissues, we used allele-specific polymerase chain reaction on the hearts obtained from these embryos. this showed that pcsk <dig> was indeed completely deleted in the heart . thus the cardiogenic progenitor deletion induced by mesp1cre is either not relevant to the development of the heart, or is needed at an earlier time point to be effective. another possibility is that either mrna or protein persisting from the earlier stages is sufficient to compensate for the deletion of pcsk <dig> with nkx <dig> cre at the stage when this driver is active. alternatively, another member of the convertase family may effectively substitute for the function of pcsk <dig> in these tissues.fig.  <dig>

although nkx <dig> cre-driven deletion of pcsk <dig> did not lead to cardiac developmental anomalies, tissues derived from the heart fields may still require the expression of pcsk5; the nature of atrioventricular septal defect observed in pcsk <dig> knock-out embryos  may suggest developmental anomalies in the formation of dorsal mesenchymal protrusion . dmp is a derivative of the posterior second heart field  and is critical for the formation of the atrioventricular mesenchymal complex  <cit> . it provides a mesenchymal “connector” between the major atrioventricular cushions and the cap of the primary atrial septum , and after myocardial differentiation, it transforms into a muscular rim at the base of the atrial septum  <cit> . mice with mutations  in the genes important for posterior shf, like alk <dig>  pdpn or tbx <dig> show atrioventricular septal defects similar to this observed in the pcsk <dig> mutants  <cit> . moreover, the development of dmp is, among others, regulated by bmp signalling  <cit>  and members of bmp family are potential substrates for pcsk <dig>  testing the requirements for pcsk <dig> in the shf , using, for example, a mef2ccre driver, would be the next logical step and will require further investigation.

pcsk <dig> is not required in the pharyngeal arches for cardiac or great vessel development
pharyngeal arch tissues initially include all three germ layers: endo-, meso- and ectoderm, and are subsequently populated by neural crest cells  <cit> . the pharyngeal arches contribute to several cranio-facial structures like bones, muscles and nerves. they also give rise to the aorta and great vessels  <cit> . to ablate pcsk <dig> in pharyngeal arch tissues we used the hoxa3cre driver  <cit> . hoxa3cre-dependent recombination initiates weakly just before e <dig>  and by e <dig>  affects all pharyngeal tissues caudal to the second arch  <cit>  . in keeping with this, deletion of tbx <dig>  in pharyngeal arch tissues, for instance, results in aortic arch malformations, including right-sided aortic arch, aortic vascular ring, and outflow tract septation defects  <cit> . to explore the role of pcsk <dig> in the hoxa3-expressing pharyngeal arch lineages, we analysed five pcsk5
Δ1/flox
; hoxa3cre
+ and five control littermate embryos. we did not observe any cardiac or outflow tract anomalies. there were also no other obvious structural defects, detectable by mri, in these embryos . to investigate if hoxa3cre was deleting pcsk <dig>  we used allele-specific polymerase chain reaction on the hearts obtained from these embryos. this showed that pcsk <dig> was indeed deleted in the pharyngeal arches . this result indicates that the expression of pcsk <dig> is not essential in the ecto-, meso- and endodermal pharyngeal arch lineages during embryonic development. thus, the pharyngeal mesodermal deletion induced by mesp1-cre is either not relevant to the development of the aortic arches, or is needed at an earlier time point to be effective.

deletion of pcsk <dig> in the neural crest did not affect heart development
the neural crest originates in the ectoderm, and contributes to the outflow tract of the heart, providing cells and mediating remodelling of the cardiac outflow and aortic arches. neural crest cells also form smooth muscle and innervate the cardiovascular system  <cit> . wnt1cre deletes specifically in the neural crest, and labelled cells contribute to the aorticopulmonary septum and cono-truncal cushions, and to the 3rd, 4th and 6th pharyngeal arch arteries  <cit>  . in keeping with this, wnt1cre-driven deletion of ptpn <dig>  results in common arterial trunk and abnormal great vessels  <cit> , deletion of mapk <dig>  – in double outlet right ventricle and septal defects  <cit> , and deletion of acvr <dig>  - in common arterial trunk, septal defects and anomalies in brachiocephalic arteries  <cit> . the zygotic mutation of pcsk <dig> and sox2cre conditional knockout shows common arterial trunk as a phenotype, and this was not observed in mesodermal deletion of pcsk <dig> with mesp1cre . as common arterial trunk is a neural crest phenotype  <cit> , and is also observed in conditional deletions of different genes induced by wnt1cre, we explored the role of pcsk <dig> in neural crest development. we examined eight pcsk5
Δ1/flox
; wnt1cre
+ and ten control pcsk5
wt/flox
; wnt1cre
+ embryos. we did not see any developmental anomalies in examined embryos . this indicates that pcsk <dig> is not required in the neural crest during cardiac development.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our results show that although pcsk <dig> is expressed in the heart and outflow tract and pharyngeal arches at later developmental stages, for normal heart, outflow tract and aortic arch development only its deletion in the cranio-cardiac mesoderm appears to have an effect on heart development. these results suggest that pcsk <dig> may have an essential and early role in the cranio-cardiac mesoderm for heart development. alternatively, it is possible that pcsk <dig> may still play a critical role in nkx <dig> -expressing cardiac progenitors, with persistence of mrna or protein accounting for the lack of effect of deletion on heart development. our studies thus define a window of development during which epigenetic factors for instance may interact with heterozygous pcsk5/pcsk <dig> mutations to affect heart development, and may explain variable penetrance of phenotype observed in humans with pcsk <dig> mutation  <cit> .
