BACKGROUND
inflammatory bowel disease  comprises a collection of disorders, which mainly include crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. these disorders cause abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and gastrointestinal  inflammation  <cit> . to date, no effective therapy has been developed and patients may have a reduced quality of life even under proper management. it has been shown that factors related to ibd include acquired factors , pathogens, genetic factors, and irregular immune system  <cit> . over the past decades, the homeostatic functions of microflora on host gi tract have attracted much attention because growing numbers of clinical studies have suggested that probiotics exhibit anti-inflammatory effects on ibd patients  <cit> . arseneau et al.  <cit>  suggested that innate immune responses play an equally significant, even more primary character compared with adaptive immune responses in ibd initiation and progression due to the observation that probiotics elicit anti- inflammatory effects in the gi tract by means of mucosal innate immune system stimulation, instead of suppression. in this study, we put efforts on addressing the interactions between probiotics and intestinal epithelial cells, the mechanism different from the conventionally dichotomous th1/th <dig> cytokine paradigm.

probiotics have no pharmacological actions confirmed, but numerous benefits have been proposed, such as immunomodulation  <cit> , antioxidant capacities  <cit> , hepatoprotective effects  <cit> , maintenance of commensal microflora  <cit> , pathogen antagonization  <cit> , anti-allergic effects  <cit>  and decreased endotoxin level in plasma  <cit> . lactobacillus plantarum, one of the most commonly used probiotics, is a member of the aerotolerant group of lactobacilli found in several fermented foods  <cit> . it is also one of the dominant lactobacillus species in the hosts’ intestinal tract. recent studies have shown that some strains of lactobacillus plantarum attenuate inflammation induced by shigella flexneri peptidoglycan by inhibiting nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated b cells , inactivating mitogen-activated protein kinase , and reducing nod <dig> mrna expression as well as protein levels, the actions which in turn lead to a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion  <cit> . moreover, van baarlen et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that even dead l. plantarum can exert beneficial functions protecting the host against the enormous array of commensal bacteria in the gut via epithelial crosstalk of mucosal interface microbiota. their research team further investigated in vivo transcriptome responses to probiotics, the work shaping that different probiotic strains induced differential gene-regulatory networks and pathways in the human mucosa  <cit> . this provides advanced concept that not only live probiotics can exert beneficial effects, but also dead probiotics are able to modulate gi homeostasis. second, because of strain-dependent properties, the anti-inflammation mechanism of single strains could not be extrapolated from other specific consequences without empirical evidence.

systemic exposure to endotoxins accompanied with elevation of interleukin - <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> has been recognized as representative features of ibd progression  <cit> . endotoxins are a family of molecules that bind to many pattern recognition receptors. one of the most dominant endotoxins is lipopolysaccharide . previous exposure to lps leads to cells hyporesponsive to subsequent challenge with lps. this phenomenon is regarded as lps tolerance.

lps tolerance is typically associated with poor signal transduction in tlr4-nfκb pathway. tlr <dig> recognizes lps from gram-negative bacteria. myeloid differentiation primary response gene  <dig>  acts as a universal adapter protein used by tlrs . interleukin- <dig> receptor-associated kinase  <dig>  belongs to the serine/threonine protein kinase family. this kinase mediates the tlr <dig> downstream signaling transduction induced by lps, forming a kinase complex required for the activation of nfκb. tnf receptor associated factor  <dig>  kinase mediates signal transduction from irak <dig>  providing a link between irak <dig> and mitogen-activated protein kinase  <dig> . tak <dig> activate iκb kinase , and thus plays a role in relaying signals to nfκb. ikk is an enzyme complex involved in iκbα phosphorylation, the action that gives rise to nfκb nuclear translocation  <cit> .

it is well-studied that poor signal transduction in tlr4-nfκb pathway is mainly attributed to negative regulators  <cit> . suppressors of cytokine signaling  <dig>  and suppressors of cytokine signaling  <dig>  are able to reduce jak/stat signal transduction, involving negative feedback to cytokine signaling  <cit> . toll interacting protein  interacts with many types of tlr signaling downstream pathways and potently inhibits the activity of irak after tlr activation. overexpression of tollip has been reported to inhibit inflammation in response to tlr <dig> signaling  <cit> . il-1r-associated kinase  <dig>  suppresses the dissociation of irak1/ <dig> from myd <dig> and the connections among traf  <dig> complexes  <cit> . phosphatidylinositol- <dig> ,5-trisphosphate 5-phosphatase  <dig>  hydrolyses phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, hence interfering with tlr4-myd <dig> signaling pathway  <cit> .

since attenuation of pro-inflammatory cytokines secretions is ibd therapeutic targets, in this study, we co-cultured human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma  cells with probiotics and then administered lps, which induced tnf-α, il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> secretion, to biologically mimic the inflammatory situation of ibd. with the purpose of determining how l. plantarum weakens the downstream signal transduction of tlr <dig>  the mrnas that encode proteins participating in tlr4-nf-κb pathway were detected by rt-qpcr. five negative regulator genes, socs <dig>  socs <dig>  tollip, irak <dig> and ship <dig>  which may result in inactivation of tlr4-nf-κb pathway, were also examined whether or not to be affected by probiotic treatment. moreover, in order to explore which cellular parts contribute mostly to the anti-inflammatory properties, we tested the anti-inflammatory efficacies of live bacteria, heat-killed bacteria, cell wall extract, intracellular extract and bacterial genomic dna in terms of negative regulator activation capacity.

RESULTS
lactobacillus plantarum myl26/ myl31/ myl <dig> treatment did not affect the caco- <dig> cell viability within 10 hours
due to excellent lactic acid production capacities of lactobacillus plantarum, we perform mtt assay to assess the most appropriate incubation time. as figure  <dig> showed, cell viability was not influenced within 10 hours. incubated with  <dig> and 14 hours, caco- <dig> cell viability showed significant decrease. as a result, we co-cultured caco- <dig> cells and lactobacillus plantarum for 10 hours in the following experiments.

lactobacillus plantarum attenuates lps-induced cytokine secretion
three different strains of lactobacillus plantarum  were tested and the most potent strain, in terms of refractoriness to subsequent lps stimulation, was selected. as shown in figure  <dig>  l. plantarum myl <dig> attenuated tnf-α, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and il- <dig> production more effectively than those of other strains.

lactobacillus plantarum myl <dig> attenuates downstream signal transduction of tlr4-nfκb pathway
the results of rt-qpcr  indicated that there are no significant differences in the expressions of tlr <dig>  myd <dig> and irak <dig> in comparison with those of lps treatment group. the expressions of traf <dig>  tak <dig> and ikkβ decreased more significantly under l. plantarum myl <dig> treatment than those under lps treatment alone.

lactobacillus plantarum myl <dig> pretreatment elicits anti-inflammatory properties by enhancing the expressions of tollip, socs <dig> and socs
since traf <dig>  tak <dig> and ikkβ were down-regulated, five potential negative regulator gene expressions were examined. as shown in figure  <dig>  there were no considerable differences in the expressions of irak <dig> and ship <dig> while the expressions of tollip, socs <dig> and socs <dig> were higher than those in the control groups.

tollip, socs <dig> and socs <dig> knockdown gave rise to impaired anti-inflammation abilities
we then used gene knockdown technique to silence tollip, socs <dig> and socs <dig>  prior tests have shown that silencing of target genes does not decrease the expression of non-target genes . tollip, socs <dig> and socs <dig> were silenced separately and subsequently challenged by lps. the silencing of these three genes resulted in the partial loss of anti-inflammatory function of l. plantarum myl <dig> .

the physiologically active components that affect socs1/ <dig>  tollip and iκbα expression might be located in the cell walls
to investigate the involvement of different cellular parts in reducing lps-induced inflammation, live bacteria, heat-killed bacteria, cell wall extract, intracellular extract and bacterial genomic dna were tested to assess which cellular parts activate tollip, socs <dig>  socs <dig> and iκbα. the results showed that dead l. plantarum myl <dig> activate gene expressions as well as live bacteria. cell wall extract, intracellular extract and genomic dna also stimulated gene expression, but not as well as the whole cell .

discussion
almost all of the ibd medicines are associated with decrease of inflammation signal pathways. on the other hand, pro-inflammatory cytokines play imperative character in mediating the progression of ibd. numerous clinical trials have shown that better control of pro-inflammatory cytokine production is an essential method for improving symptoms  <cit> .

due to sustained contact with pathogen-associated molecular patterns , the epithelial cells act as the first barrier of defense against invading microbes. intestinal epithelial cells take part in mediating balanced immune actions, as well as stimulating immune cells that dwell in the lamina propria. in this respect, baumgart et al.  <cit>  suggested that ibd results from a collapse of tolerance towards the commensal microbiota. an aberrant lps response results in an inflammatory phenotype. as a consequence, elevated attention to probiotics for the treatment of gi tract disorders has shed light on new therapeutic regimens.

lps tolerance may occur as the host’s defense system that confines an inflammatory break upon successive stimulation  <cit> . in our study, it is expected to reveal the mechanism by which prolonged contact of lactic acid bacteria with intestinal epithelial cells leads to hyporesponsive to the following inflammatory stimuli. it helps establish a probiotic screen criteria for selection of the best lps tolerance induction bacterial strains, rather than traditional criteria focused on bile-acid resistant ability.

until now, many possible anti-inflammatory mechanisms of probiotic actions have been proposed and it is observed that probiotic effect is both strain dependent and dose dependent  <cit> . although different strains of lactic acid bacteria possess different properties, there have been the most publications reported on l. plantarum when searching by key words “dead probiotics” or ”killed probiotics”. as a result, we examined three different strains of l. plantarum and used the most potent strain myl <dig>  as a study object researching the underlying molecular mechanisms.

in this research, upon l. plantarum myl <dig> treatment, the expression of genes that encode proteins participating in lps-induced inflammation was compared with that of untreated group and found that traf <dig>  tak <dig> and ikkβ expressions were suppressed. we also observed that expression of iκbα was increased. it was perhaps attributed to prior probiotic stimulation on caco- <dig> cells, the action that caused mild inflammation  as well as slightly nfκb nuclear translocation which encoded not only cytokines but also iκbα. this observation was similar to the results wahlstrom et al. reported  <cit> . they suggested that low-dose lps pretreatment changed subsequent lps-activated signal transduction pathways by means of up-regulation of iκbα that acted as a feedback control inhibitor.

since the results showed that anti-inflammatory effects of l. plantarum myl <dig> on caco- <dig> might be through interfering with tlr <dig> downstream pathway, it is reasonable to infer that the activation of the negative regulators of tlr4-nfκb pathway contributes to the anti-inflammatory effect. we investigated tlrs-associated negative regulators, including tollip, socs <dig>  socs <dig>  irak <dig> and ship <dig>  and found tollip and socs1/ <dig> expressions were enhanced by l. plantarum myl <dig> treatment. however, the consequence that tollip and socs1/ <dig> knockdown gave rise to impaired anti-inflammatory ability further supported the hypothesis that activation of the negative regulators of tlr4-nfκb pathway is a primary exploit for the anti-inflammatory effect l. plantarum myl <dig> exerts. as numerous literatures have revealed that different components of the bacterial cells can result in different activities on the human gi tract, such as cell wall components  <cit> , genomic dna  <cit> , and intracellular extract  <cit> , we further researched the tollip and socs1/ <dig> activation ability of live/ heat-killed whole bacterial cells, cell wall extract, intracellular extract and genomic dna from l. plantarum myl <dig> to see which cellular parts contributed mostly to lps tolerance induction.

in contrast with our expectations, although intracellular extract and genomic dna induced iκbα expression more significantly than that of control group, they failed to activate tollip, socs <dig>  and socs <dig>  there are five tlrs  sharing similar downstream signal pathway   <cit> . except for iκbα which directly binds to nfκb, the negative regulators tollip, socs <dig>  and socs <dig> are well-established having abilities in interference with recruitment of myd <dig> and irak. it has been reported that tollip, socs <dig>  and socs <dig> not only attenuate tlr <dig> signaling, but also have impact on tlr2/5/7/ <dig> signaling  <cit> . briefly, l. plantarum myl <dig> intracellular extract and genomic dna activate tlrs-nfκb pathways other than tlr <dig> , but they did not attenuate inflammation through induction of tollip, socs <dig>  and socs <dig>  taken together, we proposed that l. plantarum myl <dig> intracellular extract and genomic dna induced lps tolerance through pathways different from induction of tollip, socs- <dig> and socs- <dig>  which were key negative regulators activated by live/dead l. plantarum myl <dig> and cell wall components.

one of the limitations of this study is that the causes of ibd, other than breakdown of lps tolerance, are multifaceted. several lines of evidence has pointed out that in addition to inherited factors, pollution, drugs, diets, breastfeeding, even emotional stress, could be responsible for genetically failing to interpret molecular microbial patterns appropriately, thus leading to irregular innate and adaptive immune responses  <cit> . the second limitation is that pamps other than lps induce gi inflammation through different pathways. criteria for probiotic selection of lps tolerance induction strains might be not suitable with respect to inflammation symptoms caused by other pamps.

CONCLUSIONS
the administration of lactic acid bacteria in patients suffering from gi disorders regularly depends on try-error methods, and numerous probiotics treatment applied to clinical trials showed frustrated results, which perhaps might be related to the fact that the probiotic screening criteria is generally based on susceptibility to artificial gi environments  or adhesive properties instead of on immunomodulatory capacities, for instance, induction of lps tolerance. our research provided a new insight to describe the l. plantarum strain-dependent characterization in terms of anti-inflammatory effects, and suggested an essential role for lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus plantarum-derived constituents in the induction of lps tolerance.
