BACKGROUND
the digestive tract of lepidoptera is divided morphologically into three regions: the foregut, midgut and hindgut. the midgut, the largest portion of the digestive tract, is enclosed by a peritrophic membrane , lined with midgut cells, basement membrane and muscular layers. four kinds of gut cells are recognized in the lepidopteran midgut, including columnar, goblet, regenerative, and endocrine cells. columnar cells have many long, apical microvilli, which point toward the midgut lumen, and basal invaginations that comprise a basal labyrinth, which is involved in the secretion of digestive enzymes. goblet cells have a large, goblet-shaped central cavity with a role in regulating the electrogenic k+ secretion  <cit> . regenerative cells located in the basal of the midgut regenerate new cells to replace the damaged cells and contribute pupal/adult midgut cells during metamorphosis. endocrine cells, which are fewer in number, are usually basally located and extend up to the midgut lumen. endocrine cells synthesize various polypeptide hormones that act during regenerative cell differentiation and to control secretion of specific digestive enzymes after feeding  <cit> .

the pm is secreted by the lumenal surface of the midgut cells and serves to protect cells from mechanical injury or microbial infection. the pm is a semi-permeable structure composed of chitin and proteins  <cit> . there are two types of pm, defined on the basis of the site of synthesis. type i pm delaminates from the entire midgut epithelium in response to feeding and the type of meal ingested. type ii pm is produced by a specialized region of the anterior midgut that is present throughout the life cycle  <cit> . during the larval molt, the midgut pm is shed and replaced by the gut cells.

during the larval to pupal metamorphosis, the midgut undergoes remodeling, during which programmed cell death  within the larval midgut and development of the pupal midgut epithelium occur simultaneously  <cit> . insight into this process has come from analysis of other insect species. in drosophila, pcd in the midgut is regulated by steroids  <cit> , and the caspases dronc and drice are thought to regulate pcd in a. aegypti  <cit> . the morphological changes and pcd effectors during midgut remodeling have also been studied in h. virescens using histological and molecular techniques, and juvenile hormone analogs  inhibit both midgut remodeling and larval-pupal metamorphosis  <cit> .

however, many aspects of midgut remodeling are still unclear. for example, the role of hemocytes and the regulation of their migration into the midgut are only beginning to be understood. granular hemocytes have been shown to enter the midgut in metamorphically committed bombyx mori larvae. hemocytes are thought to accumulate in the midgut where they secrete type iv collagen, a major component of basement membrane, during larval to pupal metamorphosis  <cit> . in helicoverpa armigera hemocytes have also been found to migrate into the midgut of 6th- <dig> h larvae and fat bodies at 6th- <dig> h larvae, tissues that will undergo histolysis at later larval stages  <cit> . the outer surface of the midgut, which faces the hemocoel, is surrounded by a basement membrane and muscular layers composed of bundles of inner circular and outer longitudinal muscles. the mechanisms by which the hemocytes enter these tissues are not known, although proteins expressed within the basement membrane might be predicted to play important roles.

attempts to identify proteins differentially expressed in the midgut during larval molting by proteomic analysis have uncovered few proteins  <cit> . suppression subtractive hybridization  is a powerful method for identifying differentially expressed genes. in this technique, cdna from one population of cells/tissues is used as the "tester," to reveal cdnas unique to a second population, the "driver"  <cit> . using ssh with cdna from molting 5th instar larvae with head capsule slippage, molting toward 6th instar  as the tester and cdna from feeding 6th instar larvae  as the driver, we identified a cdna encoding a  <dig> amino acid protein named hmg <dig>  <cit> . by blast search from genbank  <cit> , hmg <dig> shows 34% identity to drosophila cg34026-pa, an uncharacterized gene. to characterize hmg <dig>  we used northern and western blot analyses, as well as immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization to describe the expression profile of hmg <dig> during helicoverpa development.

RESULTS
characterization of the hmg <dig> cdna
a full-length hmg <dig> cdna was obtained by suppression subtractive hybridization  using the molting 5th larval midgut  as the tester and the feeding 6th larval midgut  as the driver. the cdna included a  <dig> bp open reading frame , a  <dig> bp sequence upstream of the orf and a  <dig> bp sequence downstream, followed by a poly a tail. the cdna encodes a  <dig> amino acid protein with a theoretical pi of  <dig>  and a predicted molecular weight of  <dig> kda. amino acids  1– <dig> are predicted to comprise a signal sequence, and includes a putative cleavage site between aa  <dig> and  <dig>  in addition, a putative transmembrane region is located between aa  <dig> and  <dig>  the presence of poly a tail addition sequence strongly suggests that a full-length cdna was cloned. seven predicted serine phosphorylation sites and one threonine phosphorylation site were identified, but no n- or o-linked glycosylation sites were present . by blastx analysis, hmg <dig> is similar to other genes, with e-value <  <dig> , including ensangp <dig> from anopheles gambiae , cg34026-pa from drosophila melanogaster , ensangp <dig> from a. gambiae , ga12205-pa from d. pseudoobscura , and a conserved hypothetical protein from aedes aegypti  . analysis by protfun  <dig>  predictions  <cit>  suggests that hmg <dig> is probably a cell-envelope protein.

expression profile of hmg176
to verify the tissue specificity of hmg <dig> expression suggested by the ssh, total rna was isolated from the epidermises, midguts, fat bodies, hemocytes and heads  of molting 5th instar larvae with head capsule slippage  and analyzed by northern blot. the hmg <dig> with  <dig> bases was primarily detected in the midgut, and lower level transcripts were detected in all other tissues, consistent with the ssh study . western blot analysis revealed a similar distribution of hmg <dig> protein in all tested tissues .

the expression profile of hmg <dig> throughout development was further analyzed in midguts from 5th instar larvae to preadult by northern blot . northern blot analysis showed that expression of hmg <dig> was much lower in 5th- <dig> h larvae , which have recently removed the old cuticle and have a white head capsule . hmg <dig> expression increased slowly with feeding, and peaked at the beginning of hcs stage in 5th- <dig> h larvae, the stage at which larvae initiate head capsule slippage . subsequently, hmg <dig> transcription decreased to lowest levels by ecdysis of the 6th instar . these results are consistent with the proposal that the expression of hmg <dig> is upregulated specifically during larval molting although it increases with feeding in larvae.

in contrast to the high levels expressed during the larval molting stage, hmg <dig> was not detectable from 6th- <dig> h larvae , 6th- <dig> h larvae , 6th- <dig> h larvae , p- <dig> h pupae , or in preadults  when larvae are metamorphically committed, until late pupal stage  . these results suggest that hmg <dig> is specifically expressed during larval stages, but not during metamorphosis.

to verify the expression pattern of this gene during metamorphosis, we performed a western blot analysis of midguts from molting 5th larvae , feeding 6th larvae , wandering 6th- <dig> h larvae , earlier pupae , and later pupae . consistent with our rna analyses, hmg <dig> protein was detected in the molting 5th  larval midgut and in the feeding 6th- <dig> h larval midgut. however, the amount of protein detected in the feeding 6th- <dig> h larval midgut was much lower than in molting 5th larvae. in contrast, no obvious protein was detected in the midguts of wandering 6th- <dig> h larvae, pupae , or and preadults . these observations strongly suggest that hmg <dig> plays a specific role during larval growth and development.

hmg <dig> expression pattern in the midgut
to determine the distribution of hmg <dig> in the midgut, we began by observing morphological changes in the midgut during development. we observed dramatic changes in midgut morphology during larval development and metamorphosis. the midgut of molting 5th larvae  appeared helix-like shape and was covered with a transparent membrane. the midgut of feeding 6th larvae  was full of food. interestingly, the 6th- <dig> h midgut of wandering larvae  became red, as was the entire body. the red color of the midgut deepened in 6th- <dig> h wandering larvae , and this persisted in 6th- <dig> h- <dig> h prepupae when larvae had contracted their legs and ceased crawling , until earlier pupal stage . along with the histolysis of the larval midgut and adult midgut remodeling, the midgut assumed the morphology of a large round vesicle, containing a red substance from the decomposed larval midgut at p-3-p- <dig> d, which slowly accumulated in the hindgut .

through further analysis of the microstructure of the midgut, we noted that the midgut of wandering 6th- <dig> h larvae was quite different from both molting 5th and feeding 6th larval midguts. one difference was that there were several extra layers of cells surrounding the outside of the midgut in wandering 6th- <dig> h larvae that are not present in the molting 5th or feeding 6th larval midgut . the second difference was the red color in the wandering larval midgut. microscopy showed that the red color was due to the presence of red spots . the red spots were located in the larval midgut underneath the imaginal cells, but did not overlap with imaginal cells nuclei . analysis of cryosections, prepared from larvae throughout development, showed that the red color was first detectable in the basal cells of the larval midgut of wandering larvae and eventually seemed to expand to the entire larval midgut around the time of histolysis during metamorphosis . groups of imaginal cells appeared before the midgut turned red at about 6th- <dig> h , and began to form cell layers around the time that the midgut became red at 6th- <dig> h . the nuclei of the imaginal cells, distributed on the surface of the midgut, were examined using dapi staining.

expression and localization of hmg <dig> correlated with the morphological changes in the midgut. immunohistochemical analysis revealed a strong hmg <dig> signal in the basement membrane of the 5th-molting larval midgut , suggesting that hmg <dig> contributes to the basement membrane surrounding the midgut. in addition, a strong signal was detected in the membrane of the fat bodies of molting 5th larvae. relatively lower levels of hmg <dig> protein were detected in the midgut and fat bodies of feeding 6th larvae , while no signal was detected in midgut or fat bodies of wandering 6th- <dig> h larvae . similarly, no signal was detected in the midgut and fat body of p- <dig> d pupa and p- <dig> d preadult . these results are consistent with our previous analyses.

we also examined the expression of hmg <dig> in molting 5th larval midgut cells by in situ hybridization using digoxigenin-labeled rna antisense and sense probes to hmg <dig>  we detected a strong positive signal in the columnar cells of the midgut . in contrast, no signal was detected in negative control samples with hybridized with sense probes. thus, hmg <dig> is expressed predominantly in columnar cells of the midgut .

effects of rh- <dig> on the expression of hmg176
since hmg <dig> expression was upregulated during molting, we hypothesized that it is regulated by 20-hydroxyecdysone , an important molting hormone. to test this hypothesis, the 20e agonist rh- <dig> was injected into the hemocoel of freshly ecdysed 6th instar larvae  to examine its effect on the expression of hmg <dig>  figure  <dig> shows that hmg <dig> was upregulated  <dig> h post-injection, with maximal expression at  <dig> h post injection that declined thereafter .

discussion
here we showed the expression profile of hmg <dig> during helicoverpa larval development. our results demonstrate that hmg <dig> expression in the midgut increased towards hcs and peaked at the beginning of hcs stage in 5th- <dig> h larvae , which suggests that hmg <dig> is upregulated specifically during larval molting. hmg <dig> expression appeared to cease beginning around 6th instar, and remained undetectable throughout preadult stages, suggesting that hmg <dig> is specifically expressed during larval stages, but not during metamorphosis or after the last larval ecdysis.

our data further suggest that this protein might be involved in sustaining larval midgut during larval feeding and protecting the midgut from histolysis and remodeling. we detected expression of hmg <dig> in both the basement membrane of the midgut and the outer membrane of the fat body where it might function. this proposal is corroborated by our computational analysis, which suggested that hmg <dig> is a cell-envelope protein. however, the precise role of this and other hmg176-like proteins has not been reported.

in manduca, hcs occurs when levels of ecdysteroid peak, and larval ecdysis occurs at when levels of juvenile hormone  peak and when 20e begins to decline  <cit> . some molting regulating genes are known to be expressed before hcs. for example, levels of the transcription factor mhr <dig> are thought to rapidly increase about  <dig> h before hcs and to peak 2– <dig> h before hcs  <cit> . 20e levels of helicoverpa reaches peak levels during 5th and 6th larval molts and decreases to lower level during ecdysis  <cit> , which is similar to the expression pattern of m. sexta  <cit> . we observed that helicoverpa head capsule slippage  initiated at the 5th 36– <dig> h stage and is maintained for 12– <dig> h, which coincides with the peak of 20e levels. the fact that hmg <dig> expression obviously increased and peaked at hcs, and declined immediate after ecdysis, suggests that this gene is regulated by 20e during larval molting.

rh- <dig> is a member of a family of non-steroidal ecdysone agonists, and mimics the action of 20e. the molecular mechanisms that cause premature, incomplete molting have been elucidated  <cit> . we previously reported that rh- <dig> cause premature molting of helicoverpa larvae by inducing expression of hhr <dig>  <cit> . we observed that hmg <dig> was upregulated by rh- <dig>  suggesting that hmg <dig> may normally be regulated by 20e in vivo.

the details of pupal/adult midgut formation are not completely known. in h. virescens, the pupal/adult midgut mainly consists of imaginal cells supported by layers of muscles and tracheal cells. the imaginal cells appeared at  <dig> h after ecdysis to the final larval instar and they formed a layer at  <dig> h outside of the larval midgut where they proliferate to form the pupal/adult midgut  <cit> . recently, ohlstein and spradling  <cit>  reported that the adult drosophila posterior midgut is maintained by pluripotent stem cells. the midgut cells are continuously replenished by a distinct population of intestinal stem cells. notch signaling is required for the differentiation of intestinal stem cells daughter cells. the identification of drosophila intestinal stem cells demonstrates a possible mechanism for the maintenance of the adult midgut. we observed the groups of imaginal cells appeared and formed cell layers of the pupal/adult midgut when hmg <dig> stopped expression, which indicates the cessation of hmg <dig> is correlated to the formation of the pupal/adult midgut.

hemocytes have been found to enter the metamorphically committed larval midgut to participate the tissue remodeling  <cit> . in bombyx, granular hemocytes accumulate in a layer surrounding the midgut epithelium during pupal metamorphosis. it has also been reported that the number of granular hemocytes increases in circulating hemolymph and hemocytes migrate from hematopoietic organs to the tissues that will undergo histolysis during larva development  <cit> . interestingly, regions of hemocyte accumulation are correlated with increased expression of the cathepsin b-like proteinase, which might play a key role in fat body and midgut histolysis during metamorphosis in h. armigera. cathepsin b has been shown to be involved in the break down of adult fat bodies in h. armigera  <cit> . because hmg <dig> expression ceases when hemocytes enter the midgut during metamorphosis, this protein might be expected to help maintain the midgut by protecting it from invading hemocytes. the disappearance of hmg <dig> expression at the same time as the basement membrane might render the midgut more permeable to hemocytes, thus providing a mechanism for invasion of the midgut and fat body during metamorphosis.

CONCLUSIONS
we have presented the expression profile of a putative basement membrane protein gene. the expression of hmg <dig> is upregulated by 20e in vivo and appeared to cease beginning around 6th instar, and remained undetectable throughout preadult stages, suggesting that hmg <dig> is specifically expressed during larval stages, but not during metamorphosis or after the last larval ecdysis. we propose that this protein plays a role in maintenance and protection of larval tissues during certain stages, while subsequent downregulation of this gene would then allow the histolysis and remodeling of the midgut and fat body.
