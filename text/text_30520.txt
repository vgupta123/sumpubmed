BACKGROUND
korla fragrant pear is one of the most valuable fruits in china’s xinjiang province  <cit> . the calyx of korla fragrant pear is sometimes persistent. this can negatively affect pear shape and quality. previous studies about korla fragrant pear have examined the relationship between calyx persistence and cultivation practice  <cit> , tree vigor  <cit> , pollen source , growth regulators , and plant nutrition  <cit> . some studies have investigated the molecular mechanisms for calyx persistence in korla fragrant pear. for example, dong et al. and wang et al. cloned a kfpmyb gene related to calyx persistence using differential display rt-pcr  <cit> . qi et al. used digital transcript abundance measurements to identify genes correlated with calyx abscission  <cit> .

high-throughput sequencing has contributed greatly to the study of gene function in non-model plants. high-throughput sequencing makes it possible to understand the genome and the transcriptome of a species more comprehensively . high-throughput sequencing of rna  has been successfully applied in malus domestica  <cit> , myrica rubra  <cit> , vaccinium section cyanococcus  <cit> , litchi chinensis sonn  <cit> , pyrus bretschneideri rehd  <cit> , vitis vinifera cv. shiraz  <cit> , musa acuminate  <cit> , citrus sinensis  <cit> , prunus persica  <cit> , and diospyros kaki  <cit> . the objective of this experiment was to identify candidate genes related to calyx persistence in korla fragrant pear using both transcriptome and digital gene expression  sequencing.

differential expression analysis in sc_hua vs tl_hua
differentially expressed genes  are defined as genes that are significantly enriched or depleted in one sample relative to another | >1). in the rest of this paper, up-regulated means that the gene expression level was greater in samples with persistent calyx than in samples with deciduous calyx. down-regulated means that the gene expression level was less in samples with persistent calyx than in samples with deciduous calyx. there were  <dig> degs among  <dig> unigenes in sc_hua vs tl_hua. among these,  <dig> degs were up-regulated and  <dig> degs were down-regulated .fig.  <dig> up-regulated and down-regulated differentially expressed genes in sc_hua vs tl_hua

genes related to cell wall degradation and organ abscission
the dissolution of the middle lamella is related to abscission, especially the loss of adhesion by separation layer cells due to the effects of cell wall degrading enzymes such as polygalacturonases. several researchers have reported that cell wall modifying proteins such as expansin  <cit>  and pectinesterase  <cit>  have a role in abscission. other researchers have observed that polygalacturonases have important function in the abscission process in oil palm  <cit> , tomato  <cit> , oilseed rape and arabidopsis  <cit> . beta-galactosidase  <cit> , xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase  <cit> , and glucanase  <cit>  genes have also been shown to be related to abscission. we obtained eight genes related to cell wall degradation from degs in sc_hua vs tl_hua. these eight genes included one gene related to polygalacturonase, one gene related to polygalacturonase inhibition, one gene related to beta-galactosidase, one gene related to glucan endo- <dig> -beta-glucosidase, one gene related to lignin catabolic process, one gene related to tissue regeneration, and two genes related to xyloglucan endotransglucosylase. one expansin gene was obtained from degs in sc_ep vs tl_ep. from degs in sc_zf vs tl_zf, we obtained genes related to glucan endo- <dig> -beta-glucosidase, beta-galactosidase, polygalacturonase inhibition, xyloglucan endotransglucosylase, and pectinesterase .table  <dig> genes related to cell wall metabolism



function of spl and myb genes in organ abscission
the spl genes play an important role in the growth process of plants, including morphogenesis, the transition between developmental stages, sporogenesis, floral and fruit development, stress response, and plant hormone signal transduction  <cit> . in addition, spl genes are induced during cell senescence leading to cell death  <cit> . the myb genes participate in plant secondary metabolism  <cit>  as well as the plant’s response to hormones and environmental factors . the myb genes also regulate cellular differentiation, the cell life cycle  <cit> , and the morphogenesis of organs such as leaves . the myb genes are also involved in abscission  <cit> . we obtained  <dig> myb and  <dig> spl genes from the  <dig> annotated unigenes .table  <dig> the myb and spl genes



stress response genes and abscission
the sequencing results showed that many genes related to stress response exhibited differential expression. there was one heat shock factor protein, two dehydration-responsive element-binding proteins, one dehydration-responsive protein, two nac transcription factor proteins, one nac domain-containing protein  <cit> , and one cysteine synthase-like gene  <cit>  among the degs in sc_hua vs tl_hua. there were also genes related to the nac domain-containing protein, the pathogenesis-related protein bet v i family, the senescence-related protein gene, dehydration-responsive protein, and dehydration-responsive element-binding protein from degs in sc_ep vs tl_ep. from the degs in sc_zf vs tl_zf, we obtained genes related to disease resistance response protein  <dig>  dehydration-responsive protein, defensin-like protein, and senescence-related protein .table  <dig> genes related to stress

putative genes related to abscission
other genes in this study showed high-level differential expression. however, the function of these genes is unknown. we defined these genes as putative genes related to abscission. there were ten putative genes among degs in sc_hua vs tl_hua, eleven putative genes among degs in sc_ep vs tl_ep, and eighteen putative genes among degs in sc_zf vs tl_zf .table  <dig> putative genes related to abscission



the degs from transcriptome and dge sequencing were subjected to a search against go and kegg databases. the results showed that many of the degs were involved in metabolic processes related to chlorophyll, plant hormone metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, signal transduction and cell wall construction. the results were consistent with qi’s   <cit> , and suggest that calyx persistence in korla fragrant pear is regulated by many genes.

CONCLUSIONS
more than  <dig> degs were obtained through transcriptome and dge sequencing. these degs were related to cell wall metabolism, plant hormone metabolism, stress response, zinc finger protein, and lipid-transfer protein. analysis of the functions and metabolic pathways of the degs indicated that calyx abscission in korla fragrant pear was a metabolic process induced by a variety of genes related to cell wall metabolism and regulated by multiple plant hormones. our laboratory is currently researching the protein function of the degs in korla fragrant pear.
