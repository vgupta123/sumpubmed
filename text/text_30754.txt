BACKGROUND
soil microbial communities influence numerous physiological processes and traits of plants, including: seed germination, seedling vigour, growth and development, nutrition and the progression of various diseases . mutualistic fungi form close associations with plants that provide multiple benefits to both sets of organisms. most temperate forest trees develop a mutualistic root symbiosis, ectomycorrhiza , with fungi. this enhances the tree nutrient acquisition and the fungus ability to extend mycelia through the soil and form fruiting bodies  <cit> . various other beneficial microorganisms are also frequently associated with em, including mycorrhiza helper bacteria   <cit> . production of bacterial secondary metabolites such as auxofuran  <cit>  stimulate mycelial growth, but mycorrhiza formation can also be promoted by the reduction of soil-mediated stress  <cit>  and by augmentation of plant-fungus contacts by stimulation of lateral root formation  <cit> . helper activities can also improve mycorrhizal functioning, for instance by mobilising nutrients from soil minerals  <cit>  and protecting plants against attack by root pathogens  <cit> . although the importance of em-associated bacteria for the symbiosis is established, it is unclear how plants coordinate their gene expression responses to the mhb in the presence and absence of the emf.

like many tropical and some temperate trees, oaks display an endogenous rhythmic growth pattern with alternating phases of development and rest throughout their vegetative growth periods  <cit> . the endogenic character of rhythmic growth is reflected by the regular period of alternating shoot flushes  and root flushes  under uniform and constant environmental conditions . it has been suggested that the rhythmic development is a consequence of carbon partitioning . herrmann, et al.  <cit>  developed a microcosm system in which microcuttings of the pedunculate oak quercus robur clone df <dig> express these typical alternating flushes and using the same system, angay, et al.  <cit>  showed that concentrations of high nonstructural carbohydrates in roots are high during rf and low during sf.

rhythmic growth of oak trees affects their interactions with associated microorganisms. for instance the distribution pattern on the mother roots and the frequency of mycorrhizal root tips are affected by the endogenous rhythmic growth of q. robur  <cit> . in addition, infestation of roots by the oomycete pathogen phytophthora quercina is enhanced during rf, when roots are growing rapidly and the plant below-ground carbon allocation is highest  <cit> , and colonisation of leaves by oak powdery mildew is enhanced during sf, when the leaves are growing most rapidly  <cit> . oaks are a group of major broadleaf forest trees in europe that are key components of complex networks of biotrophic interactions, involving relationships with endophytic  <cit> , pathogenic  <cit>  and em  <cit>  fungi, as well as bacteria that stimulate em formation  <cit> . since the impact of rhythmic growth on biotic interactions of the oak is so evident, it should be investigated if it affects the gene expression response of the oak to these interacting organisms.

previously, we showed that co-inoculation of oak microcuttings with the mycorrhiza helper bacterium streptomyces sp. strain ach  <dig>  led to an increase in the number of piloderma croceum-mycorrhizal plants  <cit> . furthermore, ach  <dig> induced a systemic defence response against microsphaera alphitoides in pedunculate oak leaves, involving both jasmonic acid /ethylene  and salicylic acid -dependent signalling  <cit> . however, the cited studies did not investigate variations in transcriptomic responses to ach  <dig> during rf and sf growth stages, effects of ach 505-treatment in roots, or its interactions with mycorrhizal fungi, which are crucial elements of a mhb functional role in the oak system.

emfs, such as p. croceum are essential for optimal development of pedunculate oak microcuttings  <cit> . extensive re-programming of the oak transcriptome has been detected both during pre-symbiotic development and in mature symbiotic em with p. croceum . for instance, em formation with p. croceum leads to defence suppression in oak, embodied by low abundance of defence-related transcripts  <cit> . but the influence of dual presence of ach  <dig> and p. croceum on the oak was not investigated.

when microorganisms interact with plants, perception processes play a crucial role. plants perceive microorganisms by sensing microbe-associated molecular patterns . mamp receptors of plants are encoded by r genes including transmembrane receptor-like kinases , receptor-like proteins  and leucine rich repeat-nucleotide binding  proteins  <cit>  and they can recognize both pathogenic  <cit>  and beneficial microorganisms  <cit> . transcription factors  of the apetala 2/ethylene-responsive family, in particular ethylene-responsive element binding factors  play a major role in integrating the response to biotic interactions and are implicated in mamp-induced systemic resistance signalling  <cit> . seven erf contigs showed up-regulation in p. croceum/oak em  <cit> , but it has not been investigated how ach  <dig> treatment affects their transcription.

based on our analysis of systemic defence response in leaves to ach  <dig>  <cit>  and on the defence suppressing effect of p. croceum on oaks  <cit>  we questioned i) how the oak coordinates its gene expression responses to mhb in the absence and presence of the emf, ii) how the gene expression response of the oak to the interacting organisms is affected by the stage of growth, iii) if ach  <dig> affects the p. croceum attenuated defence related gene expression in oak or vice versa, and iv) if ach  <dig> treatment affects the transcription of erfs. this work was based on two hypotheses. our first hypothesis states that ach  <dig> induces, while co-inoculation with p. croceum attenuates the defence responses in oak. our second hypothesis states that local molecular responses to the organisms interacting with their roots are stronger during sf, expressed as differential representation of r genes, hormonal signalling genes and cell wall proteins. the second hypothesis is based on the observations of angay, et al.  <cit>  that oak roots express a higher level of root colonisation by p. quercina in rf, and also, on the general literature on mamp perception, hormonal signalling and cell wall modifications occurring during plant-microbe interactions . to address these hypotheses, we investigated transcriptional alterations in oak during the colonisation by ach  <dig> and the co-colonisation with p. croceum, focussing on the responses of roots and leaves during rf and sf. the gene expression data demonstrates that the transcriptional response of the oak is more active during sf, the period when the roots are not growing, that a defence response is induced by the mycorrhization helper bacterium but attenuated by the emf, and that several candidate genes related to mamp recognition processes and control of transcription are differentially expressed  upon these treatments.

RESULTS
oak microcuttings were successfully inoculated with ach  <dig> . three replicate rna-seq datasets were generated for microcutting lateral roots and leaves, during both rf and sf, following no inoculation, inoculation with ach  <dig> and with both ach  <dig> and p. croceum . for differential gene expression analysis, pairwise comparisons of datasets from plants inoculated with ach  <dig> versus non-inoculated plants  and plants inoculated with ach  <dig> and p. croceum versus non-inoculated plants  were performed for roots and leaves at rf and sf respectively. the validity of the differential expression analyses was confirmed by qrt-pcr analysis . numbers of decs among the samples are visualised in the venn diagrams shown in fig.  <dig> and tabulated in additional file  <dig>  ach  <dig> treatment induced more decs during sf than during rf in both roots and leaves. a suppressive effect by ach 505-p. croceum co-inoculation on the numbers of decs was evident during sf. proportions of contigs regulated in ach  <dig> inoculated plants which were also regulated when subjected to co-inoculation with p. croceum, were  <dig> in roots and 23 % in leaves during rf, and  <dig> and 3 % during sf.fig.  <dig> pedunculate oak microcuttings with interacting microorganisms. streptomyces sp. ach  <dig> on soil particles in the microcosm  piloderma croceum – oak ectomycorrhizas  and a pedunculate oak quercus robur microcutting

pfam enrichment analysis revealed significant changes in pfam terms related to perception and signalling, plant cell wall proteins, oxidases and reductases, as well as primary metabolism and photosynthesis in both ach 505- and co-inoculated plants . in roots at rf, plant cell wall protein related pfam terms were strongly enriched. for instance, xyloglucan endo-transglycosylase  was enriched in up-regulated contigs  in both treatments and fasciclin domain arabinogalactan protein  in co-inoculated plants, with other euc including phosphate-induced protein  <dig> conserved region  and probable lipid transfer . the pfam term euc was associated with increased abundance of several predicted xet, pip <dig>  fda and ltp transcripts . the terms which were enriched in down-regulated contigs  included beta-galactosidase and galactose binding lectin domain in ach  <dig> treatment, but photosynthesis and plant defence related terms in co-inoculation, with pfam terms chlorophyll a-b binding protein  and chitin recognition protein. in roots at sf under ach  <dig> treatment, the most significant pfam terms euc were related to stress associated transcriptional regulation, such as bzip and wrky dna-binding domain, the latter with seven up-regulated candidate wrky contigs . ach  <dig> treatment led to pfam terms edc of the types multicopper oxidase and glycosyl transferase family  <dig>  and co-inoculation the term chlbp with  <dig> down-regulated candidate chlbp contigs , as well as the development and defence response related term gdsl-like lipase/acylhydrolase . in leaves at rf, the terms euc included pip <dig> and xet with associated contigs  in ach  <dig> treatment, and ltp and galactose binding lectin domain in co-inoculation. the terms edc included protein kinase domain and calreticulin in both treatments and abc- <dig> transporter in ach  <dig> treatment. in leaves at sf, the terms euc included multicopper oxidase in ach  <dig> treatment, and gdsl in co-inoculation. in contrast, the terms edc included kinesin motor domain and gdsl in ach  <dig> treatment, and gibberellin regulated protein and afg1-like atpase in co-inoculation.

ach  <dig> inoculation led to go term enrichment which corroborated qualitatively with pfam term results . for instance in roots at rf, plant cell wall go term xyloglucan:xyloglucosyl transferase activity was euc in both treatments in corroboration with the pfam term xet, and lipid transport in co-inoculation, in line with the pfam term ltp. plant defence associated go terms were prominently euc upon ach  <dig> treatment in roots, and when the oaks were co-inoculated with the emf, these go-terms were edc or non-significant . among the contigs which were up-regulated upon ach  <dig> but not by co-inoculation, we detected disease resistance, protein kinase, tf, and chitinase contigs , indicating that suppression of plant defence by p. croceum  <cit>  overrules the defence-stimulating effect of ach  <dig> in roots.

to address the ach  <dig> driven gene expression in more detail, we searched for those individual contigs that were regulated as well in ach  <dig> as in co-inoculation . we reasoned that those genes regulated in ach  <dig> but not influenced by additional presence of p. croceum, may be part of the core interactome gene set of ach  <dig> on the oak. in the roots of plants during rf, these core contigs were related to plant growth  and signalling . during sf, the core contigs were related to transcriptional regulation and redox reactions , and the down-regulated contigs included photosynthesis related ps ii binding protein lhcb <dig> . in the leaves of the microcuttings, based on the arabidopsis thaliana orthologs, the contigs with corresponding patterns identified during rf were related to cell wall biosynthesis , lipid transport or signalling , and transport , whilst during sf the core contigs were involved in defence and growth-related signalling .table  <dig> contigs regulated in ach  <dig> inoculated plants which were not altered when subjected to co-inoculation with p. croceum in roots and leaves and during rf and sf

due to the pfam term enrichment in both treatments, both stages of growth, and tissues, the leucine rich repeat  and ethylene response transcription factor -associated decs were treated in more detail and their homology to orthologous transcripts in a. thaliana was estimated by blastx analysis . most of the predicted lrr contigs encoded members of the extensive families of lrr receptor-like kinases  and receptor-like proteins  with roles in a. thaliana ranging from recognition of microorganisms to signalling in growth and differentiation. the dominance of sf vs. rf in the numbers of decs was particularly strong for the predicted lrr containing defence response regulators. from the  <dig> decs of this type,  <dig> occurred at sf but only  <dig> at rf . these decs comprised candidate leucine-rich repeat-nucleotide binding site  contigs, which act as r genes in a. thaliana. predicted functions of other identified lrr-encoding decs are related to auxin responses, microtubule cytoskeleton, cell wall composition and terpenoid biosynthesis. among these signalling devices and tfs, which are most important for the ach  <dig> interaction, contigs regulated in both ach 505- and co-inoculations were detected. from lrr-receptor protein kinase encoding contigs, a contig  was up-regulated in leaves, and another , was down-regulated in leaves at rf and sf by both treatments. contig encoding lrr-nb-arc domain protein  was up-regulated in both roots and leaves at sf. from tfs, ap2/erf contig homologous to a. thaliana shn <dig>  was up-regulated in roots and leaves at rf by both treatments, and by ach  <dig> at sf . among the co-inoculation treatment specific decs, i.e. contigs which were not de by sole ach  <dig> treatment, we identified contigs homologous to a. thaliana lrr-rlp gene atrlp <dig>  lrr-rlk gene atclv <dig> and tir-nb-lrr domain protein gene attao <dig> .

discussion
the rna-seq approach has been previously used to explore both global transcriptomic responses of oaks to microbes   <cit> . in the study presented here, we applied rna-seq analysis to investigate the impact of the mhb ach  <dig> on the oak during two rhythmic growth stages and used combined treatment with the emf p. croceum to disentangle the direct impact of ach  <dig> from the one that is modified in case of co-inoculation. strong response of the microcutting roots and leaves to the ach  <dig> treatment was observed at the root-resting stage. it was manifested by a high number of decs, and it was in part attenuated by the p. croceum treatment. we began to unravel the gene expression networks linking the microcutting perception of ach  <dig> to the plant development, and detected a candidate plant immune response network in the roots following the bacterial inoculation. in this way, our results provide foundation for comparative analyses of interactions between oaks and other microorganisms to elucidate fundamental patterns.

perception of the microorganisms in oak microcuttings
in accordance with our first hypothesis, we found that defence gene expression in the oak microcuttings were induced by ach  <dig>  but attenuated by co-inoculation with p. croceum . this suggests that the defence suppression by p. croceum dominates over the elicitation of defences by ach  <dig>  for instance, contigs encoding ndr1-like disease resistance protein, chitinases and hevein were up-regulated genes upon ach  <dig> inoculation, but not so upon co-inoculation , and the go-term jasmonic acid mediated signalling pathway was euc upon ach  <dig> inoculation but eud upon co-inoculation . the only thus far characterised mechanism how an emf suppresses plant defences has been presented by plett, et al.  <cit> . they showed that laccaria bicolour produces an effector, mycorrhiza-induced small secreted protein  <dig>  that promotes mycorrhiza formation by blocking plant defence-related ja signalling. p. croceum expresses mycorrhiza-induced small secreted proteins  during em formation with oak , but none of the p. croceum missp genes have been functionally characterized. nevertheless, the suppression by p. croceum observed in co-inoculated plants seems to be a local effect, as it was only detected in roots. accordingly, mailänder  <cit>  showed that inoculation of plants with p. croceum did not facilitate powdery mildew infection of oak leaves. in contrast, the enhanced defence gene expression in ach 505-inoculated plants was also observed in the leaves, suggesting a systemic effect. this supports our previous finding that inoculating pedunculate oak roots with ach  <dig> elicits a defence response against m. alphitoides in the leaves  <cit> .

in accordance with our second hypothesis, the gene expression data demonstrated that the transcriptional response of the oak is more active during sf, the period when the roots are not growing. the oak gene expression response to ach  <dig> in sf includes decs encoding resistance proteins, involved in pathogen recognition and subsequent activation of innate immune responses. candidate lrr containing defence response regulator genes had a particularly sf-specific gene expression . the strongest induction,  <dig> to 70-fold expression levels in sf roots and leaves upon ach  <dig> and co-treatment, was observed for the lrr-nb-arc domain protein contig with close homology to at3g <dig> . at3g <dig> is a putative disease resistance gene in a. thaliana, and functional characterisation of the oak gene would now prove its role in the recognition of ach  <dig> 

detailed analysis of the enriched lrr pfam terms identified in our experiment in both treatments in roots and leaves during sf  revealed differential expression of transmembrane rlks and rlps . some of the lrr-containing receptor transcripts identified in this study were de in ach 505- and co-inoculated oaks, suggesting a function as important core genes and central response regulators of the mhb. among them, a homologue with implicated role in defence against pathogens in a. thaliana  <cit> , an rlk contig homologous to at3g <dig>  was strongly  up-regulated in roots at sf and at rf by both treatments. the induction at both stages of growth indicates that this candidate rlk may be an important core element of ach  <dig> signalling. the strongest up-regulation  in leaves occurred for an rlk contig homologous to disease resistance family protein at2g <dig>  the at2g <dig> gene is induced in a. thaliana upon infection by the biotrophic oomycete downy mildew pathogen hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis  <cit> . these strongly up-regulated transcripts we identified are probably connected to recognition events and maintenance of the interaction with ach  <dig> 

transcription factors in plant response to the microorganisms
crucial part of the plant response to microorganisms and abiotic stressors is mediated by transcriptional control, which is implemented, in large extent, by three families of tfs: ethylene-responsive-element-binding factors , basic-domain leucine-zipper  and wrky proteins  <cit> . we presented evidence of decs among members of these three tf families, occurring in the response of the oak to ach  <dig> and/or co-inoculation . a novel observation for the ach 505-interaction was the identification of de erf contigs amongst the core transcriptome affected by both treatments . in em, et signalling may be involved in control of the depth of colonisation of the plant apoplast by the emf  <cit> . our data indicates that as a mhb, ach  <dig> may affect this process by the modification of erf expression. for instance, erf <dig> contig was up-regulated in roots by the interaction with ach  <dig> as well as by co-inoculation. interestingly, the homologue in a. thaliana, aterf <dig>  is a participant in a signalling node of three interacting erfs, which appear to negatively regulate chitin signalling in defences against fungi, but positively regulate sa signalling in plant defences against the bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae  <cit> . if the erf <dig> homolog of oak shares the functional properties of aterf <dig>  warrants further analysis.

in tobacco, ap2/erf subfamily dehydration-responsive element-binding protein gene dreb1b overexpression confers improved abiotic and biotic stress tolerance  <cit>  and in our analysis, the dreb1b expression increased in roots and leaves upon the treatment with ach  <dig>  in contrast, the gene expression data of lesur, et al.  <cit>  suggests that candidate dreb1a protein of q. robur plays a role in the maintenance of bud dormancy, and it thus seems that the dreb subfamily of tfs deserves further attention in oaks.

in a. thaliana, a subgroup of bzips is involved in an abscisic acid  dependent signal transduction pathway under drought and high-salinity conditions, but also in biotic interactions  <cit> . the induction of oak bzips by ach  <dig> treatment  indicates a stress or defence response upon ach  <dig> inoculation. the induced bzips encoded homologs of central aba signalling associated tfs, in particular the predicted bzip <dig> and gbf <dig> proteins. from these bzips, bzip <dig> action relates sugar signalling to aba synthesis and aba sensitivity  <cit> , whereas gbf <dig> is induced by aba and plays a role in plant response to drought stress and aba  <cit>  in a. thaliana. we have previously observed that aba defence pathway may play a role in ach 505-based priming of host responses against powdery mildew infection  <cit> , and the role of aba mediated gene expression changes is supported by our data on light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding protein  expression as well. the lhcbs are apoproteins of the light-harvesting complexes of chloroplasts, and they are expressed ubiquitously in different plant tissues including roots  <cit> . expression of the lhcb genes is modulated by various environmental and developmental cues, including the inducer light  <cit> , and the repressors oxidative stress and aba  <cit> . the down-regulation of lhcb expression in roots can be interpreted as a stimulation of normal, darkness related down-regulation, but in leaves, the decrease in lhcb transcript levels suggests increased levels of stress, particularly upon ach  <dig> inoculation. the current data further indicates that the suggested induction of stress by ach  <dig> is attenuated by p. croceum, since none of the contigs associated with the bzip category were induced, and only two out of of eleven ach 505-suppressed lhcb contigs were suppressed upon co-inoculation in leaves at sf . this raises the question as to how ach  <dig>  powdery mildew and p. croceum treatments would affect the response of oak to abiotic stress and affect aba signalling.

our third tf group of interest, the large family of wrky proteins plays key roles mediating the regulation of plant defence and abiotic stress transcription and controlling gene expression at leaf senescence  <cit> . among the ach 505-induced wrkys, homologs of three wrkys which play roles in signal integration in a. thaliana were detected. wrky <dig> protein activates sa-induced genes but represses ja-responsive genes, i.e. controls how the signals converge from these mutually antagonistic pathways  <cit> , and wrky <dig> proteins mediate sa-mediated repression of ja signalling  <cit> . the convergence of signalling pathways is also mediated by wrky <dig> protein, which in a. thaliana is a repressor in ja-induced leaf senescence, and a common component of the ja- and auxin-mediated signalling pathways  <cit> . these results underline the urgency to characterise sa and hormonal signalling pathways in the oak system.

differential representation of transcripts related to growth and differentiation
the decs identified suggest that ach  <dig> treatment may support the processes of growth and differentiation in oak. deeper analysis of the de members of oak ap2/erf subfamily  identified a candidate shine clade of ap <dig> domain tf contig. the contig was induced by both treatments in roots and leaves. the corresponding gene atshn <dig> in a. thaliana regulates wax biosynthesis, pectin metabolism and cell wall structure  <cit> , and the induction of a atshn <dig> homolog by both treatments in oak microcuttings might thus be related to the regulation of plant development. changes in plant growth rates and patterns induced by bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi may be due to associated modifications of the main signalling pathways mediated by not only et, but also auxin  <cit> . a homologue of bak1-interacting rlk <dig> gene , which stimulates the expression of auxin response regulators in a. thaliana  <cit>  was induced by ach  <dig> and a homologue of a. thaliana air <dig>  gene, an auxin-induced microtubule associated protein which is part of the mechanism positioning the direction of cell division  <cit> , was induced by both ach  <dig> and co-inoculation .

exordium  and exordium-like genes encode cell wall proteins  <cit> , and are structurally related to the tobacco phosphate-induced protein  <dig> gene, which is re-activated in cultured cells following release from cell cycle arrest caused by phosphate starvation  <cit> . enriched pfam term pip <dig> was associated with increased transcription levels of candidate exo contigs in both ach  <dig> and co-inoculation. in a. thaliana, the exo proteins connect the extracellular carbon status to growth  <cit> , regulate cell division activity in roots  <cit> , and are essential for cell expansion in leaves  <cit> . in oak roots, the expression of exo is upregulated at rf by ach  <dig> and co-inoculation, suggesting that the treatments may affect cell division activity of oak roots.

the pfam term xyloglucan endo-transglycosylase  was enriched for up-regulated contigs in rf in both treatments , and for instance, one of the oak xet transcripts was induced by ach  <dig> alone and together with p. croceum in rf roots . in contrast, the pfam term xet was enriched for down-regulated contigs in sf in both treatments , and for instance, the oak xet transcripts with homology to the atxth <dig> gene were down-regulated by both treatments in sf roots . xet transcripts  <cit>  and activities  <cit>  are largely localized in the root elongation zone, and xet activity is required for the maintenance of root elongation  <cit> . thus, since the rf developmental stage coincides with maximal root elongation rate  <cit> , and sf with growth cessation, this association indicates that ach  <dig> may enhance root elongation process in oaks during rf and suppress root elongation in sf.

reversed pattern was observed for the pfam term beta-galactosidase, enriched for up-regulated contigs in sf in roots and rf in leaves, and enriched for down-regulated contigs in rf in roots and sf in leaves. the homology of the predicted oak proteins to plant beta galactosidases indicates that they may support tissue differentiation by the modification of cell wall galactans. of the homologs, a. thaliana bgal <dig>  is localised within cell walls  <cit> , and associated with root differentiation  <cit> . this association suggests that ach  <dig> might stimulate the maturation of cell walls in the rest stages. this is also supported by the induction of an oak peroxidase transcript by ach  <dig> alone and together with p. croceum . the oak peroxidase contig is orthologous to the product of a. thaliana gene atper <dig> , known to be up-regulated after et treatment  <cit> . increases in et and peroxidase activities are both probably involved in the stimulation of peroxidase-mediated crosslinking in the cell wall, which prevents cell expansion  <cit> . thus, during sf the up-regulation of peroxidases in oak roots may also contribute to cell wall maturation.

together, these results suggest an interactive relationship between oak cell wall dynamics and plant-ach  <dig> interactions. a similar connection has been suggested for mycorrhizal symbioses in oaks  <cit>  and populus  <cit> . detailed light and electron microscopical analyses of the suppression of norway spruce root infection by the fungal pathogen heterobasidion abietinum by the plant-protecting bacterium streptomyces strain gb 4– <dig>  <cit>  revealed how the cell walls were reinforced in the lateral roots of co-inoculated plants, preventing the colonisation of the spruce vascular cylinder by the fungal pathogen. in contrast, upon streptomyces ach 505-heterobasidion abietinum-co-inoculation of norway spruce, the lateral root cell wall structures were not altered  <cit> , and root anatomical analyses were therefore not included in this work. but the current gene expression data indicates that in the oak system, cell biological analysis of the ach 505-p croceum-interaction is also warranted.

CONCLUSIONS
rhythmic growth affected the gene expression response of oak to the interacting organisms, with much weaker molecular response in rf in terms of the number of decs. this might indicate that the physiology in roots is rather devoted to growth at rf while the processes directed towards interactions are in most part attenuated. future work will show if the repressed gene expression response consequently interferes with elicitation of defence responses or symbiosis related signalling in rf. only few contigs were de by both ach  <dig> and co-inoculation, indicating that oak coordinates its gene expression responses to ach  <dig> in the presence and absence of the emf by induction of a few, specific mamp receptors and tfs, i.e. candidate “core genes” of ach  <dig> response. our gene expression data further indicate a pivotal role of the cell wall as the responsive element in responses to ach  <dig> alone and during co-inoculation with the emf. future work needs to focus on the identified candidate genes to verify their involvement in these processes. clearly, there is also an urgent need to associate these oak genes with hormonal signalling pathways, interactions with insects and pathogens, and with the impact of abiotic environment.
