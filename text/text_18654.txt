BACKGROUND
common variable immunodeficiency  is the most prevalent symptomatic primary immunodeficiency in adults. cvid clinically presents with a history of recurrent infections at mucous membranes which is the consequence of a marked hypogammaglobulinemia  <cit> . the clinical course of cvid is complicated by a plethora of systemic immunopathology including autoimmunity, lymphoproliferation, malignancy and sarcoid-like granulomas.

cvid affects males and females equally and usually manifests in the second or third decade of life. a second peak of onset exists in childhood between the ages of  <dig> and  <dig> years  <cit> . the prevalence of cvid in the western hemisphere is estimated to be approximately 1:  <dig>   <cit> .

the majority of cvid cases are sporadic, while approximately  <dig> to 20% of cvid cases show at least one additional family member affected either by cvid or selective iga deficiency   <cit> . most multiplex cvid families show an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance but about 20% present with a recessive trait. cvid and sigad deficiency may concur in a single kindred and sigad may show progression to cvid in some affected individuals over time  <cit> .

early association and more recent genetic linkage studies have revealed several putative susceptibility loci for cvid/sigad. while most of these studies combined families with sigad and cvid, vořechovský et al analyzed siga-deficient families separately and identified a susceptibility locus within the hla region on chromosome 6p termed "igad1"  <cit> . in  <dig>  the same group reported that certain hla-dq/dr haplotypes and not other putative candidate genes within the igad <dig> region confer the protection from or susceptibility to sigad and cvid  <cit> . the same study suggested that the best prospects for non-mhc susceptibility loci could be found on chromosomes 4p, 12p and 14q, but none of these three loci reached statistical significance.

we were recently able to demonstrate genetic linkage to chromosome 16q for autosomal dominant cvid in this cohort of families  <cit>  by reanalysis of existing data restricted to the families with at least one case of cvid, in combination with additional fine-mapping  <cit> . furthermore, genome-wide linkage analysis in a large multiplex cvid family revealed linkage to a locus on chromosomes 4q. this locus on 4q was replicated  in a large cohort of small families  <cit> .

thus, there is considerable genetic heterogeneity in cvid, which mirrors the variable clinical presentation of the disease. despite these conundrums, the discovery of genetic defects in icos  <cit> , taci/tnfrsf13b  <cit>  and cd <dig>  <cit>  provides proof that defects in single genes are associated with a cvid phenotype and underscores the value of candidate gene approaches in cvid. furthermore, a considerable number of patients carrying mutations in the above mentioned genes were derived from familial cases showing recessive patterns of inheritance and sometimes involving consanguinity. the only cvid gene for which heterozygous mutations have been found in sporadic patients is taci/tnfrsf13b  <cit> .

we therefore, focused in our candidate gene approach primarily on familial cvid cases and multiplex cvid/sigad families, which showed evidence for genetic linkage to the respective candidate gene loci based on available genotype data  <cit> . we concentrated on cytokine/receptor pairs, which showed involvement in terminal b cell differentiation, preferential expression in germinal centers and involvement in class switch recombination. more importantly, the available knockout mouse models of the studied genes present with phenotypes that partially resemble aspects of human common variable immunodeficiency. a flow chart summarizing the study design and selection criteria for patients and candidate genes is provided in figure  <dig> 

in bcma/tnfrsf17-deficient mice, the generation of long lived plasma cells in the bone marrow is severely impaired  <cit> , which mirrors pathology observed in individuals with cvid  <cit> . april/tnfsf <dig> is an important factor that drives both human and murine b cells to induce ig heavy chain class switch to iga and igg  <cit> . moreover, tnfsf13-deficient mice show a selective deficiency in iga  <cit> .

interleukin  <dig>  is an important immunoregulatory cytokine, which supports terminal b cell differentiation and has potent anti-inflammatory effects. furthermore, il <dig> production by t cells is deficient in human icos deficiency  <cit> , x-linked lymphoproliferative disease  <cit>  and in subsets of cvid patients  <cit> , further underscoring the potential involvement of il <dig> in the pathogenesis of hypogammaglobulinemia. finally, il10-deficient mice develop inflammatory bowel disease, a condition reminiscent of what can be observed in patients with cvid  <cit> .

signaling via il <dig> and the il <dig> receptor can induce apoptosis in b cells  <cit> . however, the interaction is also crucial for terminal b cell differentiation  <cit> . the ability of il <dig> to drive plasma cell differentiation makes this gene an attractive candidate gene for human cvid.

chemokine  ligand  <dig>  is a potent chemoattractant for t cells and b cells, highly expressed in germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs by dendritic cells  <cit> .

bcma/tnfrsf <dig> and april/tnfsf13
seventeen probands of cvid families were analyzed. seven of these families were selected due to being linkage-positive at the tnfrsf <dig> locus on chromosome 16p . in addition, we expanded our mutation screening in bcma/tnfrsf <dig> to a larger cohort of  <dig> sporadic cvid cases. one previously described heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphism  was found in a proband of family cv <dig> in exon 2: ser81asp . in exon  <dig> two synonymous snps  were found in homozygous state in five individuals  and in heterozygous state in probands of families cv <dig> and fr <dig>  rt-pcr was performed but evidenced no alternative splicing products . a novel variant was identified in exon 3: k179q, which was present in one individual. the k179q variant was present in the heterozygous state both in affected and healthy members of the family, which renders unlikely a contribution of this mutation to the pathogenesis of the hypogammaglobulinemia. flow cytometric analysis confirmed normal expression of the protein .

april/tnfsf <dig> was analyzed in the probands from  <dig> cvid families. the families cv <dig>  cv <dig> and cv <dig> were linkage positive at the tnfsf <dig> locus . two previously described non-synonymous snps , located in exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> respectively, were found in the studied cohort .

il <dig>  il <dig> receptor α and il <dig> receptor β
the il <dig> gene was sequenced in  <dig> individuals. of those,  <dig> represented autosomal recessive cvid families, five families were selected for being linkage-positive, and five were sporadic cvid cases showing a clinical phenotype compatible with inflammatory bowel disease . one previously described heterozygous snp  located in the 3'utr of the il <dig> gene was found in frequencies comparable to that in healthy controls .

il <dig> receptor α, encoded by il10ra was analyzed in  <dig> individuals, of whom  <dig> belonged to autosomal recessive families, five were from linkage-positive families at the il10ra locus, and five were sporadic cvid cases . the known synonymous snp  in exon  <dig> and the snp  in exon  <dig>  were observed in frequencies comparable to those which are reported for normal controls in public databases .

the il10rb gene was analyzed in  <dig> cvid patients,  <dig> from cvid families  and four sporadic cvid cases . we found no genetic alterations in the  <dig> exons of il10rb.

il <dig> and il <dig> receptor
the  <dig> exons of il <dig> were amplified and sequenced in  <dig> individuals  families and  <dig> autosomal dominant cvid families  that are linkage-positive at the il <dig> locus). in exon  <dig> of the il <dig> gene the synonymous change  was observed in a frequency comparable to that reported in public databases .

the il21r gene was analyzed in  <dig> individuals . in exon  <dig> of il21r the snp  was observed in homozygous state in the proband from family fr <dig> and in heterozygous state in cv <dig>  fr <dig>  fr <dig> and fr <dig>  in exon  <dig> of the il21r gene we found a previously undescribed heterozygous snp resulting in the replacement of a conserved threonine by methionine at position  <dig> in the proband from family cv <dig> . in addition, a new heterozygous change in exon  <dig> resulting in r275q was found in the family cv <dig>  both heterozygous substitutions showed perfect segregation with the disease phenotype in these families . however, we subsequently screened a cohort of  <dig> healthy individuals with normal immunoglobulin levels and found respectively  <dig>  and  <dig>  heterozygous individuals among them, suggesting that these two coding sequence changes may not be disease-associated.

ccl18
the three exons of ccl <dig> including the 5'and 3'untranslated region were amplified and analyzed in  <dig> probands including six from cvid families linkage-positive at the ccl <dig> locus on chromosome  <dig> . no genetic alterations were found.

discussion
in recent years, genetic linkage analysis of selective iga deficiency  and common variable immunodeficiency  has led to the identification of several susceptibility loci  <cit> . however, all four molecular genetic defects underlying cvid reported to date, namely icos  <cit> , taci  <cit> , cd <dig>  <cit>  and baff-r  <cit>  were identified by a candidate gene approach using either phenotypic or genetic screening of genes known to be involved in b cell homeostasis, b cell activation or the t- b cell interaction. in the case of taci/tnfrsf13b, linkage analysis was used to identify one small cvid family with the same homozygous mutation in two individuals  <cit> .

the success with four cvid candidate genes stimulated researchers to evaluate additional candidate genes that encode proteins in the pathways of icos, taci, baff-r, and cd <dig> signaling  <cit> . here we report on the analysis of eight additional candidate genes in cvid, where no mutation was identified.

the candidacy of the genes encoding bcma and april was strong since their close relatives baff-r and taci have recently been shown to be mutated in cvid  <cit> . although both tnfrsf <dig> and tnfsf <dig> were shown to be polymorphic in the studied cohort, none of these changes were obviously disease related.

the genes encoding il <dig> and its receptor subunits were selected as candidate genes for cvid, since we were able to show that il <dig> is the critical cytokine missing in icos deficiency  <cit> . furthermore, il <dig> plays an important role in b cell development. however, no mutations were found in the investigated families.

in a context dependent manner il <dig> is able to induce differentiation of plasma cells and memory cells, or is able to promote apoptosis of resting and anti-igm-activated b cells  <cit> . ettinger et al recently showed that il <dig> costimulation in humans is capable of inducing substantial b-cell expansion, plasma cell differentiation from cd27+ memory b-cells and class switch recombination  <cit> .

therefore, we screened multiple families for mutations in il <dig> and/or il21r. apart from known snps we could identify two new heterozygous variations in il21r that result in amino acid changes and segregated with the disease phenotype in families. however these changes were also found in a screening of healthy individuals. this suggests that these two variations may not be disease associated.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we cannot provide evidence that the above listed eight genes are implicated in the etiology of cvid in this studied cohort of patients. however, only protein coding regions of the respective genes were analyzed leaving the possibility of mutations in promoter or regulatory regions. based on other studies of humans and mice these genes remain attractive candidate genes for cvid. larger cvid cohorts or cohorts of non-european origin may enable the identification of rare mutations in these genes.
