BACKGROUND
the functional connectivity between the two hemispheres has been studied in cats  <cit>  and monkeys  <cit> , and in humans using transcranial magnetic stimulation . early work in cats demonstrated both excitatory and inhibitory projections between homologous muscle representations; the territory receiving excitatory input was small in comparison to the large, surrounding inhibited region of cortex that was inevitably stimulated at higher intensities  <cit> . in humans, interhemispheric interactions between homologous muscle representations may be probed using a paired-pulse tms technique whereby a conditioning stimulus  is applied to the muscle representation in one hemisphere followed by a test stimulus  to the contralateral hemisphere. the amplitude of the motor evoked potential  in the muscle contralateral to the ts is suppressed at inter-pulse intervals between  <dig> and  <dig> ms  <cit>  suggesting that interhemispheric inhibition  dominates the interaction during this time frame.

transcallosal connections mediate interhemispheric interactions between homologous muscle representations in the primary motor cortices   <cit> . ihi is thought to be due to the cs activating an excitatory transcallosal projection that synapses on contralateral local inhibitory interneurons that subsequently inhibit the pyramidal output neurons in the test hemisphere  <cit> . in humans, callosal motor fibers are located in the posterior body of the corpus callosum  <cit> . evidence that ihi is mediated by a transcallosal pathway is derived from patients with callosal abnormalities who did not demonstrate ihi  <cit> , the finding that ihi strength increases with the number and density of callosal fibers  <cit>  and recording of descending corticospinal volleys that show reduced cortical excitability  <cit> . transcallosal projecting neurons are distinct from neurons that give rise to the corticospinal tract  <cit>  and both types are modulated by similar intra-cortical circuits  <cit> . within ihi there appears to be a division between a short interval  and long interval  interhemispheric inhibition. the neurotransmitter and receptor mediating sihi is not known  while lihi likely involves gabab-mediated inhibition as it has a relatively long time course and is increased by gabab receptor agonist baclofen  <cit> . the functional significance of the two ihi components remains unknown.

ihi is modulated during muscle contraction. chen et al.,  <cit>  tested ihi during 50% maximum voluntary contraction  of the fdi muscle at  <dig> and  <dig> ms interstimulus interval  and found that inhibition is decreased at short isi . however, it is not known if the timecourse of ihi during contraction will parallel that observed at rest, or whether contraction alters the magnitude of ihi at specific latencies not predicted from the rest state. also unclear is whether the ihi timecourse will be altered by ispsilateral versus contralateral contractions. this information is important for understanding the role of ihi during unilateral movement where it is predicted that strong ihi will be exerted on homologous muscle representations of the inactive hand. further, hemispheric dominance may influence the timecourse of ihi during unimanual contraction. lastly, there remains the issue of whether ihi will be modified by the context of the task  <cit> . altering the relevance of the motor task may alter the ihi and provide insight into interactions between motor cortices that underpin purposeful unilateral hand movements.

in the present study, we tested ihi in both cortical directions  in right-handed participants during rest, isometric contraction of the index finger, and in the postural context of holding a pen. there were two goals of the present study. the first goal was to characterize the timecourse of ihi bi-directionally during contraction of either the right or left fdi muscle. we predicted that sihi will be reduced during contralateral  <cit>  and ipsilateral contraction  <cit>  and that lihi will reveal a similar modulation. further, the greatest reduction in ihi during muscle contraction is anticipated when ihi is strongest . the second goal was to test the hypothesis that ihi is influenced by the context of the task; ihi will be maximally reduced when the motor task dictates a behaviorally relevant task such as holding a pen and that the release from inhibition will be specific to the right hand, the one that is used for writing in right-handed participants. the present study demonstrates reduced ihi bi-directionally  during unilateral contractions of either hand. these effects are observed for both sihi and lihi. ihi was reduced similarly in both isometric contraction and during the context of holding a pen. there was no evidence of hemispheric dominance during rest or any active task condition.

RESULTS
a schematic of the experimental set-up is shown in figure  <dig>  twelve participants demonstrated both short and long-latency ihi at rest  and were included in further analysis .

the tms stimulator output intensities used to achieve ~ <dig> mv peak-to-peak mep for test and conditioning pulses are shown in figure 2a. the average tms intensity to achieve  <dig> mv mep during contraction of the right and left fdi was  <dig> % ±  <dig>   and  <dig> % ±  <dig>  of the intensity used during the rest conditions. there were no side-to-side differences, demonstrating comparable excitability across the two hemispheres. during contralateral muscle contraction, tms intensities required to evoke the same mep amplitude were significantly decreased  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) . group averaged pre-stimulus emg area from the right and left fdi muscles are shown in figure 2b. solid bars indicate pre-stimulus emg for the hand at rest and hatched bars indicate emg during contraction. emg was significantly greater for the hand performing the task compared to that at rest  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ).

the three-way anova revealed a main effect of task  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ), and isi  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) but not ihi direction. there were no significant interaction terms. figure  <dig> plots resting ihi from the dominant to non-dominant direction and vice versa. the lack of ihi direction effects are clearly observed in the resting state. post-hoc tests of the main effect of 'task' revealed that active conditions were not significantly different from each other but were significantly different from rest. figure  <dig> shows that the active tasks reduced ihi compared to rest, and isometric contraction with and without pen holding had similar effects on ihi.

post-hoc testing for the main effect of isi showed that 8– <dig> ms and 30– <dig> ms were significantly different from  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> ms, thereby revealing the separation of ihi into sihi  and lihi . to summarize, ihi is similar in depth and timecourse from the right-to-left and left-to-right hemispheres. ihi in both directions reveals two phases of inhibition, the early ihi  that is maximal between 8– <dig> ms and late ihi  with maximal inhibition between 30– <dig> ms.

since our findings are consistent with previous studies showing that sihi and lihi are mediated by different mechanisms  <cit> , we performed further analysis of sihi and lihi separately. to study the effects of ipsilateral versus contralateral contraction on the sihi and lihi during rest and contraction, we combined the ihi directions and the context-dependent tasks . for sihi, a one-way repeated measures anova with factors 'task' ) was performed on the average of isis  <dig> and  <dig> ms. sihi analysis revealed the main effect of task  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ). figure  <dig>  plots the tests of the main effect of task whereby rest demonstrates significantly greater ihi than muscle contraction contralateral to either the cs or ts. however, despite the reduced ihi during active conditions, there remains a net inhibition between the two hemispheres. there was no facilitation observed during sustained contraction. these data indicate that ispsilateral or contralateral muscle activity evokes a global, bi-directional reduction in sihi. for lihi, a similar one-way repeated measures anova with factors 'task'  and data were averaged over isi of  <dig> and  <dig> ms. figure  <dig>  demonstrates the main effect of task  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ) and post-hoc tests of the main effects indicate that lihi is significantly reduced in active conditions compared to rest.

to study the effects of ihi direction and muscle activity on sihi and lihi separately, we combined the four active tasks  and compared with rest. for sihi we averaged data from isi  <dig> and  <dig> ms, for lihi the data was averaged for  <dig> and  <dig> ms isi. for both sihi and lihi, repeated measures anova showed a main effect of task   =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; lihi, f =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) but no significant effect of ihi direction and or task × ihi direction interaction . therefore, although there was a trend for greater reduction of ihi with muscle contraction for ihi from non-dominant to dominant hemisphere than ihi from the dominant to non-dominant hemisphere, the differences were not significant. sphericity was not broken in any of the statistical analyses.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
we studied the timecourse of bi-directional interhemispheric interactions during rest and tonic contractions of hand muscles in right-handed healthy controls. ihi was reduced bi-directionally during contraction of either hand compared to rest. the reduction occurred across the entire timecourse studied and was similar for the two active tasks – pen hold and simple isometric contraction. despite the reduced ihi during unimanual contraction, a net inhibitory influence continues to dominate the interhemispheric interaction during tonic contractions. these data indicate that unimanual contractions decrease the amount of ihi bi-directionally, and may provide one explanation for the activity observed in ispsilateral m <dig> during hand movements.

immediately preceding the onset a voluntary finger abduction, sihi is released and changed to facilitation, an effect observed for movements of the dominant hand only  <cit> . we now extend these findings to show that sustained tonic contraction reduces both sihi and lihi bi-directionally . unlike the effects immediately preceding movement onset  <cit> , sustained contractions did not evoke mep facilitation but rather reduced the inhibition. despite the reduction in inhibition, net inhibition was still present. further, the decrease in ihi was similar for contractions in the right  and left  hands providing no evidence of hand-dominance effects. therefore, hemispheric asymmetry of ihi may be present just before a voluntary movement but not during the tonic, sustained contractions tested here.

a previous report found greater sihi from the motor dominant to non-dominant hemisphere during rest  <cit> . we observed no such difference in the strength of sihi, a finding consistent with other reports  <cit> . we now extend this finding to lihi that was equally strong bi-directionally with no hemispheric dominance during active and rest states. though sihi and lihi may be mediated by different neural interactions, the effects of isometric contraction appear to reduce both similarly, suggesting a common role during simple unimanual contraction.

the postural context of a motor task is capable of modulating intracortical inhibitory circuits  <cit> . in the present study, we chose to investigate the contextual effects of simply holding a pen in a precision grip at 20% mvc in fdi. the rationale was that performing this task with the right compared to left hand should differentially modulate ihi since this task is strongly under the unilateral control of the right hand. in contrast to our expectation, the pen hold task released ihi similar to the isometric task irrespective of the hand performing the task. one caveat is that the 'pen hold' may have inadequately simulated the physical or strategic context of writing. it is possible that ihi studied during actual writing may reveal context-dependent influences on ihi, and the anticipated dominance effects associated with the right hand. quantifying the variable forces exerted by individual digits during writing remains a technical challenge though new methodologies may permit future study in this direction  <cit> .

perez & cohen  <cit>  investigated sihi with the cs positioned contralateral to forearm flexion. compared to rest, contraction of the arm contralateral to the cs reduced ihi with the greatest reduction occurring at 70% mvc. we tested a similar condition  using similar experimental techniques  and also observed reduction in sihi during ipsilateral contraction at 20% mvc. our data extends these findings to indicate that ihi is reduced in both directions during contraction contralateral or ispsilateral to the cs or ts. to summarize, tonic contraction of a hand muscle in either hand leads to reduced ihi bi-directionally, and this applies to both sihi and lihi.

one issue encountered in studies of ihi is determining the appropriate cs intensity, particularly when the hand contralateral to cs is active  <cit> . in the present study, we used a 'matching' technique whereby the cs intensity was set at the output to evoke ~ <dig> mv mep amplitude when fdi  was active at 20% mvc. in conditions whereby the hand contralateral to the cs was relaxed, cs intensity was adjusted to evoke ~ <dig> mv mep in the relaxed hand. thus, we normalized the ihi to changes in corticospinal activity. using similar techniques, cohen & perez report similar findings  <cit>  however when cs intensity was not adjusted for changes in excitability, ihi was not reduced. since the muscle activity increases mep amplitude, it is not possible to simultaneously match both stimulus intensities and mep amplitude for the comparison between active and rest conditions. we choose to adjust the cs intensity to match the degree of corticospinal output because we consider it likely that both the ihi and the corticospinal systems are modulated in a similar manner by voluntary activity. for example, the short interval intracortical inhibition and intracortical facilitation modulates ihi and corticospinal output in a similar manner  <cit> . therefore, adjusting the cs intensity makes it more likely that the ihi circuits are activated to a similar extent in both rest and active conditions. however, we acknowledge that matching the cs intensity, which would lead to larger mep evoked by the cs in the active condition, is another option. in our study, the conditioning stimulus intensities used in the active state were about 5% of stimulator output lower than the resting state . if the lower intensities used in the active state was applied at rest, it will likely result in lower ihi because ihi increases with higher conditioning stimulus intensities . we observed ~20% difference  in ihi between rest and active conditions. a previous study  <cit>  showed that a 20% difference in ihi requires a change in conditioning stimulus intensities of about 15% of stimulator output. therefore, the difference in ihi between rest and active conditions we observed probably cannot be entirely explained by the lower test stimulus intensities used in the active condition, but further studies are needed to address this issue.

the long-held view is that ihi functions to 1) suppress unwanted 'mirror movements' during bimanual movement and 2) to disinhibit motor cortex to produce unilateral contralateral movements  <cit> . according to these views, it seems counterintuitive that the ipsilateral m <dig> receives reduced transcallosal inhibition during muscle contraction. this reduced ihi from contralateral to ipsilateral hemisphere may provide one explanation for ipsilateral m <dig> activity during voluntary contraction of the contralateral limb  <cit> . suppressive rtms  to m <dig> reduces ihi bi-directionally  <cit>  and results in kinematic performance changes in the ipsilateral hand  <cit> . one possible reason for the shift towards less inhibition bilaterally may relate to the opportunity to efficiently engage either hand during natural movement. reducing transcallosal inhibition projecting to ipsilateral m <dig>  may facilitate the rapid engagement of the non-moving hand should the task demand change. our suggestion is that unimanual hand movements suppress unwanted mirror movements via net inter-hemispheric inhibition but diminish the magnitude of ipsilateral inhibition for efficient engagement of either hand. a testable hypothesis is that ihi magnitude from the contralateral to ipsilateral hemisphere will influence the ability to rapidly engage either hand with greater speed, accuracy or other behavioral gain. the prediction is that ihi strength directed towards the hemisphere controlling the non-moving hand will scale with the ability to engage that hand during contraction of the opposite hand.
