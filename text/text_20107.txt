BACKGROUND
alfalfa , known as the “queen of forages”, is a perennial legume. this species is native to asia, and is considered one of the first known crops with a cultivation history of at least 3500 years. due to its strong vitality, high nutritional quality, high yields, high adaptability and multiple uses, alfalfa is the main forage crop produced in temperate regions of the planet. elite alfalfa cultivars must not only have high forage yields but also maintain their productivity and stands over several years to provide substantial economic benefits. regarding this complex topic, improved fungal disease resistance has been specifically identified as the critical trait in alfalfa persistence  <cit> . in this context, it is proposed that the use of snakin- <dig> peptide , a powerful but poorly studied antimicrobial compound, to improve alfalfa tolerance to virulent fungal pathogens should be explored.

antimicrobial peptides are present in virtually all organisms and are an ancient and critical component of innate immunity. sn <dig>  the first member of the snakin family to be characterized, was isolated from a crude cell wall preparation of potato  tubers   <cit> . this cysteine-rich peptide from potato was found to be active against bacterial and fungal pathogens at extremely low concentrations   <cit> . the expression pattern of the stsn <dig> gene suggests that plant sn <dig> could be a component of constitutive defense barriers, especially those of storage and reproductive plant organs  <cit> . a second snakin peptide , which has a high amino acid identity  to stsn <dig>  was also isolated from a crude cell wall preparation of potato tubers. consistent with this high amino acid identity, stsn <dig> is also active at very low concentrations against a wide range of pathogens  <cit> . in contrast to stsn <dig>  the expression of stsn <dig> is locally induced by wounding and pathogen infection, suggesting a critical role of snakin- <dig> in both constitutive and inducible defense barriers of plants. these strong antimicrobial activities of snakin peptides have been verified using bacterial and eukaryotic heterologous expression systems  <cit> . based on the presence of the gibberellic acid stimulated arabidopsis  domain and the absence of bioinformatic  and functional  data supporting its relationship with cysteine-rich peptides from snakes venoms, stsn <dig> and stsn <dig> have been recently renamed as gsl <dig> and gsl <dig>  respectively  <cit> .

overexpression of sn <dig> in potato and wheat , sn <dig> in potato and tomato , and snakin-defensin hybrid protein in tobacco  and potato restricts pathogen invasiveness and enhances tolerance to bacterial and fungal diseases, without altering the agronomic phenotype of these crops  <cit> . furthermore, disease sensitivity is enhanced by silencing sn <dig> in wild tobacco , supporting the central role of snakin peptides in plant defense  <cit> . in addition, it has been recently shown that stsn <dig> is located in the plant cell wall  <cit> , confirming that snakin peptides are components of the physical barrier and the first line of defense used by plant cells to prevent bacterial and fungal entry  <cit> . furthermore, in concordance with the functional classification of snakin peptides as members of the gasa protein family  <cit> , stsn <dig> silencing affects cell division, primary metabolism, and cell wall composition  <cit> . snakin peptides could have additional functions in plant growth and development beyond their demonstrated function in biotic stress response. in spite of their hypothetical functional similarity, there is little to no phylogenetic reports on the relationship between stsn <dig> and gasa-related proteins.

the aim of this study was to identify and characterize snakin- <dig>  gene of alfalfa. the phylogenetic and functional analyses showed here, propose that mssn <dig> is an ancestral plant gene involved in biotic stress resistance, suggesting a coevolutionary process, in which alfalfa exerts a selection pressure for resistance to mssn <dig> on rhizobial bacteria.

dna extraction and sequence analysis of fungal strains
fungal dna was extracted as previously described by moller  <cit>  with modifications suggested by dr. e.w. boehm . briefly, 100 mg of fungal mycelia was scraped from 10-day-old pda cultures, ground in a  <dig>  ml tube with micropestle by adding 500 μl of lysis buffer . lysate was incubated at 60°c for 60 min. subsequently, 5 m nacl was added to a final concentration of  <dig>  m and mixed before adding  <dig>  vol of ctab 10% . the mixture was incubated at 65°c for 10 min. dna was extracted by adding an equal volume of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol , incubating for 30 min at 0°c and centrifuging at  <dig>  × g for 10 min at 4°c. the aqueous phase was mixed with  <dig>  vol of 5 m ammonium acetate, incubated at 0°c for 60 min and centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for 1 min. dna was precipitated from the supernatant by adding  <dig>  vol of isopropanol, centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for 10 min and washed twice with 70% ethanol. dna pellet was air-dried and resuspended in 50 μl of te . the internal transcribed spacer regions  <dig> &  <dig> and  <dig> s nrdna  and partial sequences of tub genes were amplified and sequenced by macrogen inc.  service  using the primer pairs its-1fw and its-4rv and btub2fw and btub4rv, respectively . the nucleotide sequences obtained here were deposited in the embl nucleotide sequence database, accession numbers: kf <dig> for c. trifolii tub, kf <dig> for p. medicaginis tub, kf <dig> for c. trifolii its and kf <dig> for p. medicaginis its.

in vitro antimicrobial activity assays
escherichia coli recombinant strains containing the psj <dig> empty vector or psj33-mssn <dig> were grown overnight at 30°c with shaking  in lb medium supplemented with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside in 250-ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 50 ml of medium. samples of 25 ml of culture broth  were centrifuged at  <dig>  × g at 4°c for 10 min. the pellets were washed three times with physiological solution . crude cell lysates were achieved by four consecutive cycles of freezing in liquid nitrogen followed by thawing at 37°c. after centrifugation at  <dig>  × g at 4°c for 20 min, the supernatant was resuspended in 400 μl of physiological solution. for the analysis of mssn <dig> expression in e. coli, total bacterial rna was extracted by using the rneasy mini kit and treated with dnasei . cdna was obtained using random hexamers  and amv reverse transcriptase . for pcr amplification, 1 μl of rt reaction was used. the pcr reactions were carried out in 25 μl with  <dig>  μm of each primer according to setten  <cit> . pcr conditions comprised: 1 cycle at 94°c for 3 min, 34 cycles of 94°c for 45 s, 56°c for 1 min and 72°c for 1 min. the expression of mssn <dig> was analyzed using primers p <dig> fw and p <dig> rv which amplify the complete open reading frame .

the disk inhibition assays were evaluated as described by ayub  <cit> , with very slight modifications. cultures were performed in 125-ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 25 ml of ty medium  <cit>  or lb medium for rhizobia or pseudomonas and agrobacterium, respectively. bacteria were incubated overnight at 28°c with shaking . sterile whatman no.  <dig> filter disks  impregnated with 5 μl of mssn1-free  or mssn <dig>  extracts were placed on top of bacteria-seeded plates. zones of inhibition were measured after incubation at 28°c for 24 h. the antifungal activities of the mssn <dig> extract were determined according to kovalskaya  <cit>  by counting germinating and non-germinating fungal spores. the fungal spores of phoma medicaginis var. medicaginis cbs  <dig>  from cbs-knaw fungal biodiversity center  were prepared in pdb. for the inhibition assays, spore suspensions of 1× <dig> spores/ml were used. each antifungal assay was performed in triplicate.

plant transformation
the recombinant binary vector part-35s::mssn <dig> was introduced into agrobacterium tumefaciens lba  <dig> by electroporation, by using the procedure described by shen & forde  <cit> . petioles of alfalfa clone c2- <dig> were transformed with part-35s::mssn <dig> via a. tumefaciens and cultured in vitro as described by d’halluin  <cit> , with slight modifications . petiole tissues were decontaminated by immersing in 70% ethanol for 1 min and then in 2% sodium hypochlorite for 20 min. the petioles were washed  <dig> times in sterile distilled water. explants previously injured with a scalpel were inoculated with a bacterial culture for 2 minutes , and then dried in whatman filter paper and transferred onto a solid co-cultivation shk medium  containing 100 μm acetosyringone for 2 days at 25°c in the dark. the explants were then washed with  <dig>  g/l cefotaxime supplemented with distilled water and transferred to selection/induction medium shk containing 25 mg/l kanamycin and 400 mg/l cefotaxime with routine transfers to fresh medium every 2 weeks, at 25°c and 16 h light . somatic embryos were obtained three months later and then transferred to ms rooting medium, composed of murashige and skoog basal medium  diluted 1: <dig> with water. transgenic plants were obtained about 6 months after callus induction. the regenerated plantlets were transferred to the greenhouse once they were well rooted. all plants were grown in a greenhouse at 25-20°c day/night temperature and watered daily. alfalfa transgenic events  were propagated by crossing with clone 432-19- <dig> and by cuttings to increase the number of plants available for biochemical, physiological, and genetic analysis.

identification of transgenic plants
dna was isolated from leaf tissue with the dneasy plant mini kit . transgenic plants were first identified by pcr with primers p <dig> fw and p <dig> rv , designed against the 35s promoter and sn <dig> regions of recombinant binary vector. the expression of the transgene was corroborated by rt-pcr, using primers p <dig> fw and p <dig> rv, designed against the pcr2-1-topo-mcs-derived 5′ utr region and the 5′ utr of the mssn <dig> gene . all pcr reactions were performed with taq .

for southern hybridization analysis, genomic dna was isolated from leaf tissues of greenhouse-grown plants using the dneasy plant maxi kit  following the manufacture’s indications. dna was digested with the kpni restriction enzyme, which cleaves the construct only once. then, 20 μg of dna from each sample was digested overnight and blotted after separation on 1%  agarose gel 1× tae. the dna fragments in gels were transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane . nylon membranes were crosslinked and then used for hybridization with a dig-labeled probe. prehybridization and hybridization was carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the hybridization probe mssn1digoxigenin-labeled dna was generated by pcr by using the pcr dig probe synthesis kit , using primers p <dig> fw and p <dig> rv and then used as a probe . pcr amplification was performed under standard conditions  with a program of 34 cycles of 94°c for 1 min, 50°c for 30 s and 72°c for  <dig>  min and a final cycle of 72°c for 10 min.

real-time quantitative rt-pcr 
for rt-qpcr, pcr amplification was performed with 5 μl of rt  per reaction, by using  <dig> u iq sybr green supermix  and  <dig>  mm primers, with the icycler iq system. primers for the real-time qpcr were p <dig> fw and p <dig> rv . qpcr conditions comprised: 1 cycle at 94°c for 5 min, 34 cycles of 94°c for 45 s,  <dig> °c for 30 s, and 72°c for 30 s. at each cycle, accumulation of pcr products was detected. the amplification fragment was sequenced and found to be identical  to the mssn <dig> gene. the expression level of mssn <dig> was normalized using aspartate aminotransferase   as a housekeeping gene, using primers p <dig> fw and p <dig> rv . the efficiency of primer binding was determined by linear regression by plotting the cycle threshold value versus the log of the cdna dilution  <cit> . rt-qpcr experiments were performed two or three times with independent rna samples . for each biological replicate the qpcr reactions were carried out in duplicate.

bioassays. in vitro challenges
assays were performed in healthy 15 day-old non-fumigated leaflets. leaflets were decontaminated washing them in flasks with sterile water with tween- <dig>  for 10 min. after three washes with sterile water, the leaflets were transferred to a 5 % hypochlorite solution for 5 min. finally, leaflets were washed three times with sterile water and transferred to agar-water petri dishes. plates were maintained in growth chambers programmed for 16 h light at 23°c and 8 h dark at 20°c. leaflets were inoculated by putting 5 μl of p. medicaginis ct <dig> or c. trifolii ct <dig> spore solution per leaflet. infection evolution was observed and documented by photos and the following damage score was generated to quantify injuries:  <dig>  healthy leaflet,  <dig>  countable injuries,  <dig>  uncountable injuries,  <dig>  chlorosis,  <dig>  completely damaged.

bioassays. in vivo challenges
alfalfa transgenic seeds were obtained by crossing transgenic plants s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig> with 432-19- <dig> genotype plants. transgenic and wild type seeds were treated with sulfuric acid for 10 minutes, washed three times with sterile water and placed in petri dishes with 1% agar water at 16 h of light  and 25°c. germinated plantlets were transferred to ms  <dig> x flasks and incubated at 25°c with 16 h photoperiod for 1 month, after which plants were transferred to 1: <dig> vermiculite:perlite and maintained in magenta vessels  to conserve the humidity. two-month-old plants were inoculated with p. medicaginis ct <dig> by spraying spore suspension to all aerial tissues. percentage of diseased leaflet was analyzed 30-day post-inoculation and the number of plants with regrowth and the percentage of highly defoliated plants was counted 60-days post-inoculation. as an additional severity parameter of plant disease, the percentage of vigor affected plants  was estimated. all experiments were carried out with at least  <dig> independent plants per treatment and with at least  <dig> non inoculated wild type plants used as control.

evaluation of bacterial root colonization
for the symbiosis assay, wild type and transgenic alfalfa seedlings were grown in 100% vermiculite and daily irrigated with the minimal medium called “inta <dig> without nitrogen”  <cit> . 10-days-old plants were inoculated with an early stationary-phase culture of rhizobial suspension . after a month, the plants were harvested and the number of pink nodules was analyzed. non-inoculated plants were used as controls. three replicates were analyzed for each treatment. the p. fluorescens pf- <dig> colonization assay was evaluated according to sanchez  <cit> , with two slight modifications: alfalfa was grown in inta <dig> supplemented with ca  <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig>  ne <dig> medium plus sodium octanoate  was used to estimate the colony forming units  <cit> .

statistical analysis
biological measurements were repeated at least three times with at least  <dig> different plants. significant differences between treatments were calculated using student’s t-test. qpcr experiments were independently performed three times, with comparable results. the three pcr reactions were carried out in duplicate. significant differences were calculated using anova followed by tukey test.

RESULTS
identification and evolutionary analysis of mssn1
to analyze the evolution and function of mssn <dig>  a 276-bp cdna fragment was isolated from roots by rt-pcr, using specific primers designed for a putative snakin- <dig> peptide predicted from the genome of the model legume medicago truncatula . the pcr product was cloned into a pcr <dig> topo vector and sequenced . this cdna fragment shares 98% identity with the putative snakin- <dig> peptide from medicago truncatula , hence it was named mssn <dig> . like potato snakin- <dig> peptide , mssn <dig> has a putative signal peptide of  <dig> amino acids and possesses a snakin/gasa domain  containing  <dig> cysteine residues in conserved positions within a conserved c-terminal region .figure  <dig>

ms
sn <dig> from alfalfa with the corresponding regions of snakin/gasa proteins from potato , arabidopsis  and peach  revealing  <dig> cysteine residues in conserved positions within a conserved c-terminal region. these cysteine residues are shown in yellow.



to perform a phylogenetic analysis of sn <dig>  the evolutionary study was restricted to well-characterized sequenced species of plants using proteins with high amino acid identity . using this strict criterion, complete congruence  between sn <dig> and vascular plant trees was observed , suggesting that plant sn <dig> was acquired by vertical transfer  <cit> . since our phylogenetic analysis of sn <dig> was consistent with rrna data, orthologous sn <dig> assignment is possible in any vascular plant. thus, our evolutionary study suggests that mssn <dig> from medicago sativa  presented in this work is indeed the ortholog of the stsn <dig> from solanum tuberosum , the gibberellin-stimulated transcript  <dig>  from oryza sativa  and the gasa <dig> from arabidopsis thaliana  previously described  <cit> , thus offering a starting point for experimental data integration to in-depth understanding of sn <dig> function in plants. it is important to note that orthologous identification of snakin-like peptides could not be predicted by comparing their amino acid identity with snakin/gasa-related proteins such as arabidopsis gasas . therefore, assessment of the correct orthology of snakin/gasa genes requires rigorous phylogenetic analysis.figure  <dig>

in order to support the vertical origin of higher plant sn <dig>  the sn <dig> gene is present in the primitive vascular plant selaginella moellendorffii . in addition, an exhaustive phylogenetic analysis of proteins within genome databases failed to find orthologous genes of sn <dig> in the ancestral moss physcomitrella patens, and in green algae species belonging to the phylum chorophyta such as ostreococcus lucimarinus, micromonas sp. rcc <dig>  volvox carteri and chlamydomonas reinhardtii. in agreement with this finding, proteins containing the snakin/gasa domain are widely distributed in land plants but completely absent in moss and green algae , suggesting that sn <dig> is an ancestral gene that appeared in the vascular lineage after the vascular/bryophyte separation. this is not surprising considering that the pioneering ancestors of land plants that dominated terrestrial environments had to confront dramatic stresses, including the infection produced by an extreme diversity of microbial soil communities, selecting a number of genetic innovations  <cit> . therefore, the emergence of sn <dig> could be an adaptation of ancestral plants to land.

analysis of the in vitro antimicrobial activity of mssn1
regarding the in vitro characterization of mssn <dig> antimicrobial activity, the mssn <dig> gene was expressed in e. coli. the expression of mssn <dig> in the transformed e. coli cells was confirmed by rt-pcr analysis . the antimicrobial activity of mssn1-free or mssn <dig> extracts was tested against the bacterial and fungal alfalfa pathogens agrobacterium tumefaciens lba <dig> and phoma medicaginis var. medicaginis cbs  <dig> , respectively. antimicrobial activity of the mssn1-free extract was undetectable, whereas the mssn <dig> extract showed a high inhibitory activity against bacterial growth  and fungal spore germination . as previously described for other members of snakin/gasa peptides  <cit> , the antimicrobial activity of mssn <dig> against organisms belonging to different domains, at least bacteria and eukarya, is congruent with its function as a component of the non-specific immune system of plants.figure  <dig>

analysis of mssn <dig> expression
the expression pattern of the mssn <dig> gene was analyzed by rt-pcr, to explore the function of mssn <dig> in wild type alfalfa plants. mssn <dig> expression was detected in all tissues analyzed, including roots, stems, leaves and young floral buds . rt-qpcr assays were performed to evaluate whether the expression levels of mssn <dig> is modified by exposure to microorganisms. mssn <dig> transcript levels were about two-fold higher in leaves than in roots when plants were grown under control conditions . interestingly, mssn <dig> levels did not change in response to biotic stimuli, such as the pathogenic bacterium a. tumefaciens lba <dig>  the symbiotic strain sinorhizobium meliloti bl225c and the free-living strain pseudomonas fluorescens pf- <dig> . in concordance with the characterization of stsn <dig> expression in potato  <cit> , the expression pattern of mssn <dig> suggests that sn <dig> is a component of the constitutive defense barrier.figure  <dig>

molecular characterization of transgenic alfalfa plants overexpressing mssn1
in order to investigate the antimicrobial activity of mssn <dig> against alfalfa fungal pathogens, transgenic alfalfa plants were generated. the mssn <dig> gene was placed into a constitutive expression cassette under the control of the camv 35s promoter , and introduced in alfalfa plants of the regenerable clone c2- <dig> by agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation . pcr assays  and southern blot analyses  were used to identify three independent transgenic alfalfa lines, named s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig>  harboring the camv35s:mssn <dig> construct. evolutionary analyses showed that medicago truncatula and lotus japonicus genomes have only one locus per genome of the sn <dig> gene, mtr_1g <dig> and lj5g <dig>  respectively. consistent with this, as well as with the remarkably conserved genome structure among legumes  <cit>  and the tetrasomic inheritance and outcrossing nature of alfalfa  <cit> , the non-transformed alfalfa plants showed the presence of three copies, probably alleles, of the mssn <dig> gene . as expected, transgenic plants showed extra and differential bands on southern blot hybridizations, suggesting the incorporation of the transgene in different regions of the alfalfa genome . the three events showed stable inheritance of the transgene . expression of the transgene was confirmed by rt-pcr analyses using specific primers designed for the chimeric 5′ utr . individual lines were also analyzed by rt-qpcr assays for mssn <dig> expression. transgenic lines showed that the expression level of total mssn <dig> was 100-fold higher than wild type endogenous expression , suggesting that the three transgenic lines were good candidates to evaluate the effects of overexpressing mssn <dig> figure  <dig>

similar to transgenic lines from potato, wheat and tomato  <cit> , overexpression of mssn <dig> did not appear to affect negatively the general phenotype in transgenic alfalfa plants, e.g. there was no reduction in the plant vigor in transgenic plants compared to wild type plants . therefore, transgenic alfalfa plants appear to be a suitable platform to study the role and biotechnological potential of mssn <dig>  unfortunately, no mssn <dig> reduced expression or silenced alfalfa plants were obtained . similar results were reported by meiyalaghan  <cit>  where the authors found no regenerant plants using antisense vectors expressing gsl <dig>  and gsl <dig>  under their endogenous promoters regulation. these results probably indicate that mssn <dig> silencing had detrimental effects on transformation or regeneration efficiency. in concordance with this observation, sn <dig> silencing drastically affects the cell division and primary metabolism of potato plants  <cit> .

molecular characterization of two highly virulent alfalfa fungal strains
anthracnose and spring leaf spot, caused by the fungal pathogens colletotrichum trifolii and phoma medicaginis, respectively, are the most destructive infections of alfalfa worldwide. in the analysis of alfalfa resistance to these fungal diseases, there is usually a tradeoff between virulence and characterization of these pathogenic strains. generally, long-term successive passages of archetype strains in vitro attenuate the virulence of these pathogens in vivo, while pathogens freshly isolated present a high virulence phenotype but their taxonomic position is commonly speculated based on disease symptoms or microscopy observations. in order to bypass this constraint, we used two highly virulent alfalfa fungal strains from alfalfa breeding programs, maintained through sequential plant infections and characterized through amplification, sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of conserved genes and intergenic regions. the evolutionary analyses of its region and tub gene showed that these isolates belong to colletotrichum and phoma . in fact, these dna fragments from virulent strains  share 100% nucleotide identity with the its region and tub genes from c. trifolii cbs  <dig>   and p. medicaginis cbs  <dig>  , respectively. in accordance with these data, these isolates were named colletotrichum trifolii strain ct <dig> and phoma medicaginis strain ct <dig>  unlike the well-characterized fungal strains c. trifolii cbs  <dig>  and p. medicaginis cbs  <dig> , strains c. trifolii ct <dig> and p. medicaginis ct <dig> are highly virulent on alfalfa and infect a wide range of commercial cultivars as well as the alfalfa clones used in this work, c2- <dig> and 432-19- <dig>  this confirms that the form of conservation of fungal pathogens is essential to maintain their alfalfa virulence, and therefore, to study the genetic basis of resistance to fungi in alfalfa.

antifungal in vitro activity of mssn1-overexpressing transgenic plants
as a first step to investigate the antifungal activity of transgenic alfalfa lines, in vitro challenge assays were performed. detached leaflets were inoculated with a spore suspension of two virulent and molecularly characterized alfalfa fungal strains p. medicaginis ct <dig> and c. trifolii ct <dig> incubating the leaves in petri plates for 7 days . disease severity was estimated by visually scoring disease symptoms in infected leaflets as a percentage of leaflets showing disease lesions . the three transgenic lines  showed significant lower percentage of diseased leaflets than wild type plants when challenged with both p. medicaginis ct <dig>  and c. trifolii ct <dig> virulent strains , suggesting an antimicrobial function of mssn <dig> under biotic stress conditions. moreover, this small-scale study could facilitate rapid visual screening of a large number of transgenic events , saving time, reducing cost, and speeding up the introgression of this antimicrobial transgene into commercial varieties, especially in outcrossing species such as alfalfa  <cit> .figure  <dig>

the three transgenic alfalfa lines  were chosen for progeny analysis of their potentially enhanced biotic resistance. the clone 432-19- <dig> was used as a pollen donor in a sexual cross with the transgenic lines to avoid the common inbreeding depression of progeny from self-crossed alfalfa plants. the presence and expression of the transgene in leaves of the progeny plants were assayed by pcr and rt-qpcr analyses, respectively . in vivo assays for antifungal activity against p. medicaginis ct <dig> were carried out spraying a spore solution to transgenic and wild type plants. plant disease severity was estimated by evaluating agronomic parameters for two months. wild type plants manifested all the symptoms of the disease  <cit> , including dark brown lesions on the stems, dark brown lesions on the leaflets that begin with specific dark color injuries, wilting leaves, chlorosis, and defoliation. transgenic lines presented scarce symptoms and usually looked like control plants .

firstly, leaflet disease was estimated by visually scoring disease symptoms in infected plants. one month post-infection, the percentage of diseased leaflets was significantly lower in transgenic lines than in wild type plants . two months post-inoculation, disease severity was analyzed by evaluating the vigor of the plants, the number of plants with regrowth and the percentage of highly defoliated plants. transgenic plants showed significantly higher levels of regrowth than wild type plants . in fact, disease symptoms were present in wild type regrowth but not in transgenic plants . overexpression of mssn <dig> in alfalfa improves plant vigor under fungal stress conditions . in addition, wild type plants showed more defoliation than transgenic plants but the differences were not statistically significant . altogether, transgenic plants showed a better performance against phoma infection than wild type plants, suggesting an antifungal activity of mssn <dig> in vivo.figure  <dig>

coevolution evidences of mssn <dig> and rhizobia
similar to observations on other effector molecules of innate immunity  <cit> , constitutive expression of mssn <dig> could provide alfalfa a selective advantage over the pathogens during the early stages of microbial infection. however, it can also have adverse effects on beneficial microorganisms such as nitrogen-fixing symbiotic bacteria. to investigate this apparent paradox, the in vitro antimicrobial activity of mssn <dig> against nine rhizobacterial strains isolated from different legume plants and soil were analyzed. all rhizobacterias isolated from alfalfa nodules  showed no inhibition against the mssn <dig> extract . in contrast, the symbiotic nitrogen fixation strains isolated from other legume species, such as medick , soybean , bean  and lotus spp. , were susceptible to the mssn1extract . these results suggest that alfalfa and their symbiotic bacteria may have coevolved.table  <dig>

there is a fine line between bacterial symbiosis and chronic infection. while one is beneficial the other is detrimental. recent findings suggest that both share mechanisms for sidestepping host defenses  <cit> . legumes evolved rapidly and shortly after their origin, and nodulation most likely evolved several times during their divergence  <cit> . these plants have symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria living in root nodule compartments that also contain antimicrobial compounds. to avoid infection with phytopathogenic bacteria, nitrogen-fixing rhizobial bacteria and leguminous plants have developed complex signal exchange mechanisms that allow a specific bacterial strain to induce its specific host plant species to form invasion structures through which the bacteria can enter the plant root  <cit> . the evidence of co-evolution presented here suggested that mssn <dig> peptide could be part of the battery of compounds involved in discriminating the symbionts from other microbes, so as to allow the beneficial infection and inhibit colonization of potentially pathogenic microbes.

in concordance with the hypothesis of plant-microbe coevolution, mssn1-overexpressing transgenic plants showed nodule production of s. meliloti bl225c comparable with that of the wild type plants , suggesting that mssn <dig> does not affect plant infection when nitrogen-fixing bacterial strains have an alfalfa origin. then, to explore the effect of mssn <dig> on free living strains of rhizobacteria as pseudomonas, the antimicrobial activity of mssn <dig> on p. fluorescens pf- <dig> isolated from soil samples was studied. interestingly, p. fluorescens pf- <dig> showed hypersensitivity to the mssn1extract . in agreement with the in vitro activity of mssn <dig>  p. fluorescens pf- <dig> showed differential proliferation in the rhizosphere of wild type and transgenic lines of alfalfa 30 days after inoculation, suggesting an increased antibacterial activity in mssn1-overexpressing plants . these results show additional in vitro and in vivo evidence of mssn <dig> as a part of the innate immune response and the wide range of activity of mssn <dig> figure  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
previous studies and the results reported here show that snakin peptides have important and ancestral roles in land plant innate immunity. interestingly, mssn1-overexpressing alfalfa transgenic plants show increased antimicrobial activity against virulent fungal strains without altering the nitrogen-fixing symbiosis, opening the way to the production of effective alfalfa transgenic cultivars for biotic stress resistance. in this work, data also suggest a coevolutionary process, in which alfalfa exerts a selection pressure for resistance to mssn <dig> on rhizobial bacteria.
