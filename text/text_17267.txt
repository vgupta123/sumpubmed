BACKGROUND
adams belong to the m12b subfamily of metalloproteinases and metalloproteinase-like proteins  <cit> . a prototype adam is a type i transmembrane protein, but some adams are also present as soluble forms, either due to alternative splicing or protease-mediated cleavage  from the cell surface  <cit> . adams are multi-domain proteins with an extracellular metalloproteinase domain, a disintegrin domain and a cysteine-rich domain; therefore they are also called mdc  proteins. some but not all adams contain a canonical zinc-binding motif within the metalloproteinase domain, which is required for protease activity  <cit> . the disintegrin domain can selectively interact with different integrins  <cit> ; together with the cysteine-rich domain, it may modulate cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion  <cit> , as well as substrate recognition by the metalloproteinase domain  <cit> . the cytoplasmic tail contains binding sites for a variety of cellular proteins, and may be involved in inside-out signaling that regulates the activity of the ectodomain  <cit> .

a phylogenetic tree of adams identified in different species can be found in the tree families database treefam  <cit> . about half of the adams are solely or predominantly expressed in the testis of mammals , with no orthologue found in nonmammalian species  <cit> . functions of these adams are thus mainly related to mammalian reproduction. the other adams are expressed widely in tissues and organs other than the testis. many of these adams are implicated in embryonic development. mice lacking or carrying defective adam genes often display developmental abnormalities that vary from defects in adipogenesis and myogenesis  <cit>  and mild dysfuctions in the central nervous system  <cit> , to more severe defects such as early embryonic and perinatal lethality  <cit> . the activities of adams are also linked to a variety of human diseases, such as cancer  <cit>  and cardiovascular diseases  <cit> , as well as rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases  <cit> . however, the molecular bases for the functions of adams are largely unappreciated, and identifying the in vivo substrates and binding partners for adams remains a major challenge  <cit> . furthermore, functional redundancy between two or more adams seems to be a common phenomenon  <cit> , posing an additional difficulty for understanding the roles of adams in development and diseases.

one area that has drawn increasing interest concerns the roles of adams in cell signaling, mainly via shedding of cell surface proteins by adam metalloproteinase activities. through this process, adams release key extracellular signaling proteins  from the cell surface  <cit> . adams also participate in the generation of key intracellular signals  by performing an obligate ectodomain cleavage event prior to a regulated intramembraneous proteolytic cleavage  <cit> . recently, a subgroup of nonproteolytic adams, adams  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  were shown to function as receptors for the secreted leucine-rich glioma inactivated  proteins, which are required for proper synaptic transmission in the brain  <cit> . regulation of cell adhesion and migration is another major function of adams. a large body of evidence suggests that adam disintegrin domains can interact with integrins, although most adams do not contain the conserved rgd integrin binding sequence  <cit> . the cysteine-rich domain of adam <dig> can also mediate cell adhesion by binding cell surface syndecans  <cit> . furthermore, adam metalloproteinase activities are also involved in remodeling extracellular matrix and regulating cell-cell adhesion through cleavage of extracellular matrix components   <cit>  and adhesion molecules   <cit> .

the amphibian xenopus laevis has been used for decades as a model system for studying early vertebrate development. the easy availability of large numbers of fertilized eggs, the ability of the embryos to develop and be manipulated in vitro, and the transparent epidermis of the tadpoles provide some practical advantages over mammalian and other models. however, the pseudo-tetraploid genome and long generation time of this species prevented it from being widely used for genetic and genomic research. these difficulties were overcome in large part by the adoption of xenopus tropicalis, a closely related species with a true diploid genome and a relatively short generation time. the genome sequence of x. tropicalis is now complete, and large collections of est clones from both x. tropicalis and x. laevis are available, providing useful tools for systematic prediction and characterization of large families of genes. a recently published genome-wide analysis of the matrix metalloproteinases , another family of extracellular metalloproteinases that is related to the adams, revealed evolutionary conservation and distinct duplication patterns of mmps in x. tropicalis as compared to humans and other mammals  <cit> . several adam genes have been cloned previously from x. laevis and characterized for their functions in fertilization and development  <cit> . given the key roles of these adams in vivo, it is important to establish their orthologues in mammals and to identify their paralogues in the xenopus genome.

as an initial step for systematic studies of all adam family proteins in the frog species, we started out to identify the homologues of known vertebrate adams that are expressed in x. tropicalis. our study shows that most non-testis specific adams are conserved between frogs and mammals. however, some potential loss or gain of adam genes  in x. tropicalis as compared to mammals suggests evolutionary divergence of adams in this amphibian species.

RESULTS
adam genes in the x. tropicalis genome
searches of the current version  of the x. tropicalis genome assembly yielded homologues for most known vertebrate non-testis specific adams. sequences of these predicted adam genes were then used to search against the est databases  to obtain full-length cdna clones from x. tropicalis and, where possible, x. laevis. no orthologues of the mammalian testis-specific adams have been found in any nonmammalian species  <cit> ; similarly, we were unable to identify a xenopus orthologue for any of these adams. a predicted gene encoding the orthologue of x. laevis adam <dig> , an adam expressed only in testis with a potential role in fertilization  <cit> , was localized to scaffold_ <dig> of x. tropicalis genome. no orthologue of adam <dig> was found in any other species examined, including mammals, fish and chicken. therefore it is likely that adam <dig> function is limited to reproduction of the frogs and related species.

a phylogenetic tree of x. tropicalis and human non-testis specific adams is shown in figure 1a, in which these adams are divided into several subfamilies . results of this analysis are consistent with an expanded tree including other representative vertebrate species , and with previously published phylogenetic studies of adams from various species  <cit> . comparison of the exon-intron structures of x. tropicalis adam genes with those of human adam genes  <cit>  reveals conservation of most of the splice sites between orthologues . adams can also be divided into clades based on their splicing patterns, as suggested by kleino et al. . while this subgrouping method places emphasis on conservation and divergence in gene structure, the method used in figure 1a is based on sequence similarity and probably better reflects the conservation and evolution in gene function. in general the phylogeny-based subgrouping  agrees well with the splicing-based method , but it also differs from the latter in two aspects: the exclusion of adam <dig> from the meltrin clade  and the inclusion of adams  <dig> and  <dig> into the same clade. we believe that the former  better indicates the functional relationship among adam paralogues . the phylogeny-based subgrouping is the method of choice here because sequence homology and gene functions are the primary focus of this study.

sequence information and expression patterns of identified xenopus adam genes are summarized in table  <dig>  several adams, including adams  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  are known to be required for normal development and health in mice  <cit> . as expected, all of these essential adams are conserved in frogs, with >50% identities in protein sequence between x. tropicalis and human orthologues; the other adams are more divergent . in cases where full-length sequence information of x. laevis cdna is also available, the similarities between x. tropicalis and x. laevis orthologues are high , consistent with the close relationship between these two species .

* expression patterns were estimated by the presence of ests  in different organs and/or developmental stages, as deposited in genbank. "widespread" was assigned when ests are present in multiple  organs, and "high level" was assigned when multiple  est entries are present in a single organ at a single developmental stage and account for >50% of all ests found in genbank.

nd: not determined.

the orthologous relationship between human and x. tropicalis adams is further supported by synteny analyses, which show the conservation of genetic linkages between most adams and nearby genes in these two species . however, we were unable to identify any likely orthologue for adam <dig> or  <dig> in the x. tropicalis genome or in x. tropicalis/x. laevis est databases. adam <dig> is mainly expressed in the testis  <cit> , but limited expression is also detected in muscles and kidney  <cit> . this adam seems to be mammal-specific and no orthologue has been identified to date in other animals  <cit> . therefore it is perhaps not surprising that it is also absent in frogs. in the human genome adam <dig> lies next to adam <dig> and adamdec <dig>  whereas in x. tropicalis this metalloproteinase gene "cluster" is replaced by four homologues of adam <dig> in tandem . adam <dig> is one of the most widely studied adams, with potential roles in cancer and inflammatory diseases  <cit> . however, mice with targeted deletion of the adam <dig> gene do not display any apparent developmental or pathological phenotypes  <cit> , indicating that this gene is dispensable for normal development and health. the human adam <dig> gene was mapped to chromosome  <dig>  with tubgcp <dig> and znf <dig> on one side and kndc <dig> and gpr <dig> on the other side . although the loci of adam <dig>  tubgcp <dig> and znf <dig> are also conserved in the chicken genome, kndc <dig> and gpr <dig> genes are not localized in the vicinity; instead two other genes, spfh <dig> and chuk, are found in this region . there are two adam <dig> homologues in fish , one flanked by znf <dig> and spfh1/chuk, and the other by tubgcp <dig> and an additional homologue of chuk , suggesting possible genome duplication associated with gene loss in this region. in the x. tropicalis genome, tubgcp <dig> and znf <dig> were localized to scaffold_ <dig>  whereas kndc <dig> and gpr <dig> were localized to a different scaffold, scaffold_ <dig> , and spfh <dig> and chuk lie separately on two other scaffolds . no adam <dig> homologue was found on any of these scaffolds. these results suggest that this genomic region has undergone extensive rearrangement during evolution, and that the adam <dig> gene was probably lost in the frogs. the possible absence of an adam <dig> orthologue in the x. tropicalis genome may reflect a poor conservation of this adam metalloproteinase during evolution. we also cannot rule out the possibility that the available genome sequence data may be incomplete.

in addition to potential loss of adam genes as compared to the mammalian genomes, there is also evidence for additional adam genes in the x. tropicalis genome. a homologue of adam <dig>  which we named adam10-like, was found in xenopus but absent in most placental mammals. we also identified four homologues of adam <dig> on scaffold_ <dig> of the x. tropicalis genome assembly. features of x. tropicalis adams identified in this study are discussed in the following sections in terms of different adam clades as indicated in figure 1a.

adams  <dig>   <dig> and 19
we previously identified x. laevis adam <dig> as a proteolytically active adam expressed predominantly in cranial neural crest  cells  <cit> , an embryonic cell population that gives rise to craniofacial structures in vertebrates  <cit> . ectopic expression of a protease-dead mutant of adam <dig>  as well as antisense morpholino mediated knockdown of adam <dig>  inhibits cnc migration in neurula stage embryos  <cit> . a closely related adam, adam <dig>  was recently found to be required for cnc induction and migration in x. laevis  <cit> . the similarity between the in vivo functions of adams  <dig> and  <dig> raises the possibility that these two adam metalloproteinases may act through similar mechanisms . furthermore, there may be additional paralogues with similar roles in cnc development encoded by the frog genome. to address these questions we performed a search for closely related homologues of x. laevis adams  <dig> and  <dig> in x. tropicalis.

analysis of the x. tropicalis genome indicates that there are three adams closely related to x. laevis adam13: x. tropicalis adams  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  we obtained full-length cdna constructs for these adams by direct cloning. as shown in figure 3a, sequence comparison with other adam family members suggests that these three proteins constitute an adam subfamily with clear orthologous relationships between xenopus and mammalian adams  <dig> and  <dig>  although the relationship is not as clear, the most parsimonious explanation is that xenopus adam <dig> and mammalian adam <dig> are orthologues. this is further supported by the synteny analysis, which shows a conserved genetic linkage between adam13/ <dig> and spef <dig>  hspa12b and an unknown gene . adam <dig>  13/ <dig>  and  <dig> orthologs are detectable in zebrafish, suggesting that this adam subfamily was present in the ancestral vertebrate . rt-pcr analyses showed that adams  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are each expressed by neurula stage in x. tropicalis . functions of these adams in cnc and neural development will be discussed separately .

adam15
human adam <dig> was originally named metargidin , because it was the first cellular disintegrin protein  found to contain the consensus rgd integrin binding site in the disintegrin domain  <cit> . however, this rgd sequence is not conserved in mouse adam <dig>  <cit> . the mammalian adam <dig> gene encodes an active metalloproteinase, and several substrates have been identified for this enzyme  <cit> . mice lacking adam <dig> do not show any apparent deficiencies, but they are more resistant to pathological neovascularization  <cit> .

we searched the x. tropicalis genome and est databases and identified an adam <dig> homologue that is 44% identical to the human protein. similar to human adam <dig>  <cit> , the gene encoding this homologue was localized next to efna <dig> in the x. tropicalis genome , suggesting that it is the orthologue of adam <dig>  a cdna clone encoding the x. laevis orthologue of this protein was also found in the est databases . surprisingly, unlike the mammalian adam <dig> proteins, which contain the consensus zinc-binding motif hexgh in the catalytic domain, both x. tropicalis adam <dig> and its x. laevis orthologue have the sequence hqxgh in this position . an e to q mutation in the same motif has been shown to result in loss of proteolytic activity in adam <dig>  <cit> , hence it is likely that frogs do not have an active adam <dig> metalloproteinase. mammalian adam <dig> contains a proline-rich cytoplasmic tail with several potential src homology- <dig>  domain binding sites  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  many of these prolines are conserved in mammals and frogs. in contrast, while the mammalian adam <dig> proteins share a strikingly similar signal peptide, this peptide is less conserved in xenopus adam <dig> . finally, primate, canine and bovine adam <dig> proteins have a consensus rgd integrin binding site in the disintegrin domain; this sequence is not conserved in rodent or frog adam <dig>  instead xenopus adam <dig> proteins contain an rgd sequence within the cysteine-rich domain . interestingly, this second rgd sequence is also present in canine and bovine adam <dig>  whereas in the primate and rodent orthologues it is replaced by the sequence rgn . a possible explanation is that the ancestor of vertebrate adam <dig> might have two rgd integrin binding sites, one in the disintegrin domain and the other in the cysteine-rich domain. both of these rgd sequences were maintained in the canine and bovine lineages  but lost in rodents, while primates and frogs each retained a different rgd sequence. the conservation of the synteny, the sh <dig> binding motifs and the rgd sequences indicates that these xenopus homologues are real orthologues of mammalian adam <dig>  although the metalloproteinase consensus sequence was lost during evolution. in contrast, the two zebrafish adam <dig> homologues both contain the conserved zinc-binding motif but lack either rgd site .

adam28
adam <dig>  is a proteolytically active adam that is highly expressed in the epididymis and in lymphocytes  <cit> . several alternatively spliced forms of adam <dig> have been detected in vivo, including a soluble form without a transmembrane region or cytoplasimc tail  <cit> . adam <dig>  although proteolytically inactive, is closely related to adam <dig> . genes encoding adam <dig>  adam <dig>  and adamdec <dig>  form a metalloproteinase gene cluster on human chromosome 8p <dig>  presumably as a result of gene duplication  <cit> . adamdec <dig> is a soluble adam-like protein lacking part of the disintegrin domain and the entire cycteine-rich domain; a conserved histidine residue in the zinc-binding motif is replaced by aspartate, but such a replacement was thought to have no negative effect on the metalloproteinase activity  <cit> . expression of adamdec <dig> is restricted to the immune system and is regulated by various stimuli during monocyte differentiation  <cit> .

as discussed above, no xenopus orthologue of adam <dig> was identified in this analysis. adamdec <dig> seems to exist only in mammals  <cit> , and we were unable to identify any likely orthologue in the x. tropicalis genome or in x. tropicalis/x. laevis est databases. however, a blast search against the x. tropicalis genome assembly yielded four potential genes possibly encoding adam <dig> homologues on scaffold_ <dig> . although these potential genes have only slightly higher sequence similarities to adam <dig> than to adam <dig>  the deduced protein sequences all contain a conserved zinc-binding motif . therefore they are considered homologues of adam <dig> , and were assigned the names adams 28a-d. we obtained full-length cdna clones for adams 28a and 28b, and found two partial clones for adam28c . in addition, we identified a full-length cdna encoding a soluble form of adam28b  in x. laevis est databases . the presence of soluble adam <dig> in both humans and frogs indicates a potentially conserved function of a diffusible adam <dig> metalloproteinase in vivo. a sequence alignment for frog and mammalian adam <dig>  is shown in additional file  <dig>  as in the case of human chromosome  <dig>  the cluster of adam <dig> homologue genes on scaffold_ <dig> of the x. tropicalis genome may also represent gene duplication events in this region. sequence comparison of the four x. tropicalis adam <dig> homologues with human adam <dig> and adamdec <dig> nevertheless indicates no orthologous relationship between them . therefore these duplication events in the frog and human genomes may have happened separately after the divergence of amphibians from mammals. consistent with this hypothesis, both chicken and fish genomes lack such duplication in this region .

adam9
adam <dig>  was among the three active adam metalloproteinases  first identified in myoblasts. because one of these adams, adam <dig>  is required for myotube formation in a myoblast cell line and in certain muscle tissues in vivo, these three adams were also called the meltrins  <cit> . however, adam <dig> is not the most closely related paralogue of adams  <dig> and  <dig> , and no apparent phenotype in muscle development was observed in adam9-/- mice, although a recent report showed that they eventually develop retinal degeneration  <cit> . these findings suggest that adam <dig> does not belong to the meltrin clade.

an x. laevis orthologue of adam <dig>  was cloned in a previous study and, like its mouse orthologue, was found to be ubiquitously expressed at different developmental stages  <cit> . in this study we identified a full-length est clone encoding the putative x. tropicalis orthologue of adam <dig>  like their mammalian and zebrafish orthologues, both x. tropicalis and x. laevis adam <dig> proteins contain a proline-rich cytoplasmic tail . two sh <dig> binding motifs have been identified previously in the cytoplasmic tails of human and mouse adam <dig>  of which the c-terminal proximal one is also conserved in all the tetrapod species examined, including both x. tropicalis and x. laevis .

adams  <dig>   <dig> and 23
three proteolytically inactive adams, adams  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> , form an adam clade that is highly expressed in the brain  <cit> . studies with knockout mice revealed that each of these adams is required for normal neuronal function  <cit> . it was recently shown that adam <dig> functions as a receptor for the secreted protein lgi <dig>  mutations in lgi <dig> cause heritable epilepsies in humans, and one of these mutated forms of lgi <dig> fails to bind adam <dig>  <cit> . in a separate study, adams  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were all shown to interact with lgi <dig> and the closely related lgi <dig>  <cit> , suggesting that there may be a common mechanism for these adams in maintaining normal brain function. two x. laevis cdna clones encoding different adams, one partial  and one full-length , were described previously  <cit> . our sequence comparison with the x. tropicalis and human genomes indicates that they are orthologues of mammalian adams  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . x. laevis adam <dig> is highly expressed in cnc cells  <cit> , but no functional study for this adam has been reported to date.

here we report the full-length cdna sequences for x. tropicalis adams  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  as shown in table  <dig>  these three x. tropicalis adams resemble their human orthologues in both the deduced protein sequence and the high expression level in the brain  <cit> . adam <dig> is dispensable for survival in mice, but has important roles in spatial learning, motor coordination and nociceptive response  <cit> . like its mammalian orthologues, x. tropicalis adam <dig> also has a very short cytoplasmic tail . however, it lacks a large portion of the propeptide that is present in human, mouse and zebrafish adam <dig> . a survey of the exon-intron boundaries suggests that this difference arises from adoption of different splice sites, as exons  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and part of exon  <dig> in human adam <dig>  are absent in the x. tropicalis adam <dig> transcript, while the other exons are conserved between these two species . because adam <dig> does not have the zinc-binding motif that is required for metalloproteinase activity, it is conceivable that part of the adam <dig> propeptide may have been lost in frogs during evolution.

mice lacking either adam <dig> or  <dig> develop severe ataxia and die shortly after birth, and the similarity in phenotype has led to the speculation that these two adams may act together in a nonredundant way  <cit> . because of the similar abilities of adams  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> to interact with lgis, it was also proposed that distinct functions of these adams may depend on their expression in different cell types  <cit> . interestingly, both human and mouse adam <dig> transcripts have multiple alternatively spliced forms, and mouse cdna libraries obtained from different types of cells contain different splice variants of adam <dig>  <cit> . we identified three differently spliced isoforms of adam <dig> in x. tropicalis, and sequence comparisons revealed that the previously published x. laevis adam <dig>  represents yet another isoform . in mammals, alternative splicing results in multiple transmembrane adam <dig> variants with different cytoplasmic tails; however, no soluble form has been reported to date  <cit> . among the four xenopus adam <dig> isoforms identified in this study, three  are transmembrane forms that differ in their cytoplasmic tails. interestingly, the other isoform  is a truncated variant that lacks a transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic tail . given the potential physiological role of adam <dig> as a cell surface receptor, this soluble form may provide a possible regulatory mechanism to control the functions of the transmembrane forms of adam <dig>  it will be of interest to determine if the splicing of adam <dig> mrna in xenopus is also cell-type specific.

adams  <dig>  10-like and 17
adams  <dig> and  <dig> are probably the most extensively studied adams because of their important roles in development and disease. adam <dig>  was originally discovered in drosophila as an essential component of the notch signaling pathway  <cit> , while adam <dig>  was first cloned in mice as the major enzyme required for shedding of the cytokine tnf-α  <cit> . adams  <dig> and  <dig> share many substrates, and it is still a subject of debate as to which of these two enzymes is required for cleaving notch receptors  <cit> . the xenopus system has long been used to study notch signaling, and ectopic expression of a dominant-negative form of mouse adam <dig> was shown to cause a notch phenotype in x. laevis embryos  <cit> . therefore it is important to identify the xenopus homologues of adams  <dig> and  <dig> and understand their respective roles in early development.

we identified cdna clones for both x. tropicalis and x. laevis adam <dig> from xenopus est collections using blast searches. although it is not clear if the x. tropicalis genome contains a true tnf-α gene, these xenopus adam <dig> proteases may still be involved in cleavage of other members of the tnf superfamily and/or ligands of the epidermal growth factor receptor, as their mammalian orthologues do  <cit> . in addition to our previous identification of x. laevis adam <dig>  <cit> , we obtained a full-length clone encoding x. tropicalis adam <dig>  a pair-wise sequence comparison shows 82% identity between x. tropicalis and human adam <dig>  the highest among all adams identified in this study , indicating that functions of this enzyme are likely conserved in frogs. in the drosophila genome there exist two adam <dig> homologues, kuzbanian  and kuz-like , both of which are required for notch signaling in certain cells and tissues  <cit> . we also found an actively transcribed paralogue of adam <dig> in x. tropicalis, which we named adam10-like . however, sequence comparisons suggest that adam10-like is not the orthologue of drosophila kul . therefore these two adam <dig> paralogues in different species may have been derived by two independent gene duplication events. homologues of adam10-like were found in some other animals, including x. laevis, zebrafish and a few mammalian species. detailed sequence analysis and functional studies of adams  <dig>  10-like and  <dig> will be reported elsewhere . a phylogenetic tree estimating the evolution of adams  <dig> and  <dig>  is shown in figure  <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
adams are widely involved in developmental and pathological processes through their activities as proteases and binding partners for other proteins. the recent emergence of xenopus tropicalis as a powerful new vertebrate model for developmental and genetic studies prompted us to take a genome-wide approach to identify adam genes existing in this species. using bioinformatics tools, we were able to obtain full-length sequence information for putative x. tropicalis orthologues of most mammalian non-testis specific adams. the orthology between x. tropicalis and human adams were further supported by conserved splicing patterns and synteny. the high sequence similarities between mammalian and xenopus adams  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are in good agreement with their essential roles in vivo, as demonstrated by previous studies with knockout mice. our sequence analyses also revealed the conservation of certain features, such as alternative splicing and cytoplasmic sh <dig> binding motifs, in some adams. functional characterization of these adams  in x. tropicalis may provide useful information to guide future research on human development and diseases. evolutionary divergence is also evident by the potential loss of some adam genes and adam domains/motifs in xenopus. orthologues of adams  <dig> and  <dig> were not detected in the current version of x. tropicalis genome sequence, and adam <dig> protease activity and part of the adam <dig> propeptide seem to be absent in x. tropicalis. these findings suggest that functions of these adams or adam domains are likely not conserved. in contrast, the additional adam10- and adam28-like metalloproteinases, which presumably arose as results of gene duplication, may have conferred selective advantages during the evolution of amphibians. the sequence information described in this study provides the basis for understanding the evolution of adam functions in vertebrates.
