BACKGROUND
an upstream regularly sequence  is a dna fragment upstream of a gene which acts as binding sites for transcription factors and rna polymerases to initiate transcription. urss play important roles in the transcriptional control of gene expression. some of these genes are expressed throughout the life cycle of an organism, which are driven by constitutive urss. in contrast, tissue-preferred urss control gene expression only in a specific tissue. the activities of inducible urss are regulated by various abiotic and biotic factors and their corresponding genes are up- or down-regulated by environmental cues or external stimuli.

it is imperative and commercially valuable to identify and characterize various types of urss for annotating gene function by generating desired transgenic plants expressing gene of interest in a particular tissue. in eukaryotes, the urs regions are structurally more complex than those in prokaryotes. both up- and down-stream of a transcription start site  play important roles in regulating gene expression. the tss could be identified by aligning the full-length cdna sequence of a gene to the corresponding genome sequence. the candidate urs sequence might be predicted by analysing around  <dig> kb upstream of the start codon, which is predicted to include up- and partial down-stream region of the tss.

in rice, the whole genome sequences of both indica and japonica subspecies had been reported  <cit>  and their gene annotation systems are established  <cit> . in addition, their full-length cdna sequence data are also available  <cit> . thus, a bioinformatics-based approach could be employed to predict the urs sequences of all annotated genes on a genome-wide level. as a result, several urs databases have been set up and are publicly available  <cit> .

subsequent to the prediction of urs sequences, it is highly essential to further characterize these urss’ roles in driving the transcription of the genes under their control. urs activities can be predicted by the expression profiling of their driven genes. early studies of large-scale of expression analyses were carried out by microarrays and various chip platforms are available such as affymetrix, agilent, bgi/yale, nsf20k, nsf45k and so on  <cit> . in addition, serial analysis of gene expression   <cit> , massively parallel signature sequencing   <cit>  and rna seq  <cit>  have also been employed for expression analyses. currently, large amount of data on rice gene expression have been released publicly   <cit> . in the meantime, various rice gene expression databases have been established. some examples include ricexpro   <cit> , rice oligonucleotide array database   <cit> , rice gene expression   <cit> , oryzaexpress   <cit> , riceplex   <cit>  and rice expression database   <cit> . in addition, the genome-wide expression analysis was also carried out to dissect the rice gene expression profile. several reports have focused on the expression analysis of genes in multiple tissues and developmental stages. jain et al.  <cit>  carried out the rice affymetrix microarray analysis using  <dig> different tissue samples at various developmental stages. wang et al.  <cit>  carried out a dynamic gene expression profile covering the entire life cycle of rice. they also employed the affymetrix genechips to investigate the rice gene expression using  <dig> tissues at various developmental stages. sato et al.  <cit>  carried out a transcriptome analysis using  <dig> tissue samples and showed critical developmental and physiological transitions throughout life cycle of rice growing under natural field conditions. besides microarray analysis, nobuta et al.  <cit>  used the mpss to analyze rice gene expression by sequencing mrna transcripts from  <dig> libraries and revealed new expression evidence of some genes in which no expression signal was previously detected. in addition, davidson et al.  <cit>  carried out transcriptome analysis using  <dig> rice tissues from various developmental stages by the rna_seq technology, providing additional resources of rice gene expression data. although large amount of expression data are available, relatively limited reports focused on the investigation of tissue-preferred gene expression patterns.

in rice, a considerable number of urss have been isolated and characterized. some of them have been used for driving the constitutive expression of a foreign gene in transgenic plants. examples include the urss for the genes osact <dig>  <cit> , oscc <dig>  <cit>  and osrubq <dig>  <cit> . others are root-preferred  <cit> , leaf-preferred  <cit> , panicle-preferred  <cit>  or seed-preferred  <cit> . although many rice urss have been molecularly characterized, it is still necessary and useful to identify various types of urss on a genome-wide level to benefit researchers in plant transformation and gene function annotation. in this study, we had identified various types of tissue-preferred genes based on their expression patterns on a genome-wide level. subsequently, a few urss were selected and cloned into upstream of the uida gene, which encodes β-glucuronidase  to investigate their transcription activities through gus expression. our results provide  <dig> tissue-preferred candidate genes for sourcing their urss, which may be useful for gene function annotation and plant transformation for genetic improvement.

RESULTS
genome-wide survey of tissue-preferred genes in the rice genome
to investigate tissue-preferred genes in the rice genome, related microarray, mpss and rna_seq expression data were downloaded from the geo dataset as described in the methods section. initially, we employed the dataset with accession number gse <dig>  <cit>  to identify the following  <dig> types of genes:  root-preferred,  seed-preferred;  leaf-preferred; and  panicle-preferred genes. the expression patterns of these candidate tissue-preferred genes were verified by the remaining three expression datasets as indicated in the methods. genes with inconsistent expression patterns among different datasets were excluded from further analysis. using this criteria, we have identified  <dig> root-preferred ,  <dig> seed-preferred genes ,  <dig> leaf-preferred genes , and  <dig> panicle-preferred genes . for each type of tissue-preferred genes,  <dig> genes were selected for further analysis . among the  <dig> selected root-preferred genes, most of them also showed higher or similar expression abundance in roots when compared with three previously identified genes rcc <dig>  <cit> , hpx <dig>  <cit>  and loc_os03g <dig>  <cit>  while no or very low expression was detected in the remaining tissues . for the three previously identified leaf-preferred genes osppc <dig>  <cit> , gos <dig>  <cit> , and ospip2- <dig>  <cit> , they were expressed in leaf with higher level but they also showed significant expression in other tissues. in contrast,  <dig> selected leaf-preferred genes were mainly detected in mature and young leaves and no or very low signal could be detected in the remaining tissues. as expected, three previously identified panicle-preferred genes rts  <cit> , osipa  <cit> , and osugp <dig>  <cit> , rts showed very high expression in panicles . in this analysis, we identified only  <dig> panicle-preferred genes . out of these, ten genes were listed and all of them showed similar expression level in panicles compared to that of a previously identified panicle-preferred rts but higher than the expression level of other two previously identified panicle-preferred osipa and osugp <dig> .figure  <dig> 
tissue-preferred genes and their expression profiling among various developmental stages of tissues. a total of  <dig> genes were listed in each group of tissue-preferred genes. the first three genes in each group were formatted with red fonts, which were previously characterized and, therefore were used as reference genes. the remaining  <dig> genes were formatted with black fonts, which were identified in this study. the log2-transformed expression value from normalized expression data were used for heat map analyses. red, black, and green colors indicated that transformed expression values were < <dig>  =  <dig>  and > <dig>  respectively, in the matrix. t <dig>  roots; t <dig>  mature leaves; t <dig>  young leaves; t <dig>  young inflorescence ; t <dig>  inflorescence ; t <dig>  seeds.



tissue-preferred genes are mainly expressed in a particular tissue or cell type. their functions may be restricted to the tissue or cell type. to evaluate whether these genes are biased toward particular functions, we investigated gene ontology  terms  <cit>  and identified overrepresented go terms  in all four types of expressed genes. a total of three categories of go terms have been assigned to these genes including molecular function , biological process , and cellular component   <cit> . overrepresented root-preferred genes were found to play roles in response to stress and transport ; they are mainly localized on cell wall, membrane or cytoplasm with hydrolase, transporter and catalytic activities as well as for lipid and rna binding . in contrast, for seed-preferred genes, their biological functions in “multicellular organismal development” and “developmental process” were overrepresented . on the other hand, overrepresented leaf-preferred genes are mainly localized in plastid, membrane, thylakoid, cytoplasm, organelle or intracellular and their overrepresented molecular function is catalytic activity . for panicle-preferred genes, their overrepresented go terms included “transport”, “establishment of localization”, “secondary metabolic process”, “cellular amino acid”, “derivative metabolic process”, “small molecule metabolic process and “lipid binding” for molecular function .

expression analysis  <dig> candidate endogenous genes in  <dig> rice tissues
by genome-wide survey of tissue-preferred genes using microarray, mpss or rna_seq analysis, we have identified considerable numbers of genes with tissue-preferred expression. to verify the expression of these genes,  <dig> genes were randomly selected for quantitative real-time rt-pcr  analysis to investigate their expression profile among  <dig> different tissues as shown in figure  <dig>  the qrt-pcr expression data confirmed the tissue-preferred expression patterns when compared with the available expression data from microarray, mpss or rna_seq. for example, the gene loc_os02g <dig>  encoding a lipoxygenase, was found to be leaf-preferred and was mainly expressed in two-week old leaves . the gene loc_os12g <dig>  encoding atpase  <dig>  was root-preferred with the highest expression in two-month old roots . another root-preferred gene loc_os03g <dig> encodes protease inhibitor and was mainly expressed in young and mature roots . for panicle-preferred genes, we selected  <dig> genes for expression validation. both loc_os03g <dig> and loc_os10g <dig> encode udp-glucosyltransferase and stilbene synthase, respectively. they showed immature panicle-preferred expression with the highest expression level at the 5–10 cm length stage of panicles . the remaining one gene loc_os10g <dig> encodes inositol-3-phosphate synthase, which was mainly expressed in more than 10 cm panicles that were wrapped inside leaf sheath . for two seed-preferred genes, both of them were mainly expressed in mature seeds . the gene loc_os02g <dig> encodes glutelin and loc_os06g <dig> encodes a prolamin precursor. the gene with locus name loc_os12g <dig> encodes an expressed protein with unknown function. its expression was detected only in leaves and roots but not in reproductive tissues .figure  <dig> 
expression patterns of some tissue-preferred genes in various tissues shown by qrt-pcr analysis. the mrna relative amount was calculated as described in the section “methods”.  to  showed the expression patterns of  <dig> tissue-preferred genes. the total rna samples were prepared from a total of  <dig> tissues at different developmental stages, which were used as templates for qrt-pcr. these tissues were shown as below:  <dig>  two-week old leaves;  <dig>  two-month old leaves;  <dig>  two-week old roots;  <dig>  two-month old roots;  <dig>  0-5 cm long panicles;  <dig>  5-10 cm long panicles;  <dig>  more than 10 cm long panicles;  <dig>  opening panicles;  <dig>  flowering panicles;  <dig>  milky seeds; and  <dig>  mature seeds .



the gene loc_os03g <dig> showed expression mainly in young pollen
our data from qrt-pcr analysis showed that the gene loc_os03g <dig> was mainly expressed at the early stage of panicle development . to further investigate the expression patterns at the cellular level, we generated the urs::gus  transgenic plants. for each gene, around  <dig> kb urs region upstream of start codon of the gene was used for urs motif searches and primer selection. for the gene loc_os03g <dig>  the  <dig>  bp urs fragment was amplified from the rice genome using the primers listed in the additional file  <dig>  the fragment was subsequently cloned upstream of the reporter gus gene. following the cloning, this construct was transformed into the rice genome by agrobacterium-mediated transformation. the investigation on the urs::gus plants showed that no gus activity was observed in leaves or roots or any other non-reproductive tissues. the gus activity was detected only at the early stage of panicle development . further investigation showed that the gus activity was limited only to the anthers but not in the floret husks . the gus-stained anthers were then squeezed with a forceps and pollen was subjected to further observation under microscope. the result showed that the activity of the urs was restricted to young pollen at the uninucleate stage . the qrt-pcr was carried out to analyze expression abundance of the gus reporter gene and the result confirmed that the gene loc_os03g <dig> was mainly expressed in 0–5 cm long immature panicles .figure  <dig>

similar to the gene loc_os03g <dig>  the endogenous gene loc_os10g <dig> was also mainly detected at the early stage of panicle development as shown by qrt-pcr . the urs::gus activity was also observed at the early stage of florets . however, while no gus staining was observed in anthers and the staining was restricted only to floret husks . although the gene loc_os10g <dig> was mainly expressed in panicles , the urs also showed activities in both leaves and roots . interestingly, either in leaves or in roots, the gus activities were detectable only in vascular bundles, similar to the expression patterns in floret husks. thus, the gene showed vascular bundle preferred expression. the gus activities in both leaves and roots were also in according with the qrt-pcr analysis as shown in the additional file 7b.figure  <dig>

the gene loc_os10g <dig> was mainly expressed in mature pollen
based on the qrt-pcr data, the gene loc_os10g <dig> showed the highest expression level at the panicle with more than 10 cm long and the gene also showed the high expression level at the 5–10 cm long panicles . a similar expression pattern was observed in the transgenic plants harboring its urs::gus construct as the gus activity was only detected in the florets of panicles with more than 10 cm long . further observation showed that gus staining was restricted to anthers and no gus activity was observed in lemma and palea of rice florets . under microscope, the gus activity was observed only in pollen but not in anther walls . further examination showed that the faint gus activity could be detected from the uni-nucleate stage of pollen and the strongest activity was observed at the mature stage of pollen . however, no gus activity was detected in pollen tubes. the qrt-pcr analysis of the gus reporter gene further confirmed that the gene loc_os10g <dig> was mainly expressed in the mature pollen .figure  <dig>

the seed-preferred urs from the gene loc_os02g15090
the qrt-pcr analysis showed that the gene loc_os02g <dig> showed seed-preferred expression . a  <dig>  bp of urs sequence of this gene was isolated from the rice genome and this region was found to contain two seed-preferred motifs including aaca_motif and skn-1_motif  <cit> . the former motif was shown to play a role in suppressing the expression of this gene in other tissues other than endosperm. the latter is a cis-regulatory element along with cooperative interaction with other motifs such as aaca, gcn <dig> and acgt, required for high level of endosperm expression of this gene. the transgenic plants harboring the urs::gus t-dna showed no gus activity in leaves, stems, roots and panicles . in contrast, the gus activity was detected only in seeds . upon further examination, the gus expression as indicated by the staining was observed in endosperm as well as embryos . subsequently, we quantified the expression abundance of the reporter gus gene in various tissues by qrt-pcr analysis. the results showed that the gus gene exhibited the highest transcript abundance in mature seeds .figure  <dig>

the loc_os06g <dig> gene also shows seed-preferred urs activity
besides the seed-preferred urs from the loc_os02g <dig> gene, we have also investigated another urs, which drives the expression of the loc_os06g <dig> gene. the qrt-pcr analysis showed that this gene was also mainly expressed in seeds . a  <dig>  bp long urs fragment of this gene was amplified by pcr and was subjected to sequencing confirmation. the sequencing analysis showed that its urs possessed only one seed-related motif, skn-1_motif. interestingly, the transgenic rice plants harboring the urs::gus construct showed similar expression pattern to its endogenous gene by qrt-pcr) with no gus activity in roots, leaves, stems and panicles . in contrast, gus activity was observed in seeds including endosperms and embryos . as expected, the highest expression of the reporter gus gene in mature seeds was further confirmed by qrt-pcr analysis .figure  <dig>

discussion
candidate tissue-preferred genes and their urss for the area of transgenesis
tissue-preferred genes provide candidate urss for transgenic plant development. we have identified a considerable number of tissue-preferred genes which are either vegetative  or reproductive  tissue preferred. not all tissue-preferred genes were listed in this study. some of tissue-preferred genes were not included due to their relatively low expression level in that specific tissue. the tissue-preferred urss that are highly expressed will be used for functional genomics studies and genetic modification of crops by transgenic techniques. the number of characterized tissue-preferred urss from monocot plants is less than those from dicot plants  <cit> . in addition, many of these tissue-preferred urss have been patented, limiting their use in biotechnology crop modification  <cit> . our data provides additional resources to further characterize novel urss for tissue-preferred expression of targeted genes which will benefit crop breeding approaches that use transgenic techniques.

messenger rna-level expression and tissue/cell-level reporter gene analysis in transgenic rice plants
by the genome-wide survey of gene expression level among multiple tissues, we have identified a considerable number of genes with leaf-preferred, root-preferred, panicle-preferred and seed-preferred expression patterns. however, the activities of their urss are required to be verified by the reporter gene analysis in transgenic rice plants. our data showed that even for these genes with the same tissue specificity by mrna level expression analysis, they may exhibit difference in their expression patterns in tissue/cell level. for example, both genes loc_os03g <dig> and loc_os10g <dig> are panicle-preferred; the urs::gus analysis showed that the former was young pollen preferred  and the latter was mature pollen preferred . thus, the activity of an urs must be confirmed by the corresponding urs driven reporter gene in their transgenic plants. on the other hand, the expression profile of an internal gene revealed from mrna expression data may be different from that of the reporter gene. one of the examples is the gene loc_os10g <dig>  the gene exhibited panicle-preferred expression pattern and its activity was mainly detected in the inflorescence with 3–30 cm long . however, in the transgenic plants harboring its urs::gus cassette, the gus activities could be detected not only in the floret husks but also in the vascular bundles of leaves and roots . the data suggested that an urs from a panicle-preferred gene might also drive the expression of the reporter gene in non-panicle tissues. however, further investigation should be carried out to figure out the inconsistency of expression patterns between endogenous mrna and the reporter gus gene.

tissue-preferred genes and their functions
in rice, at least  <dig>  genes showed expression evidence by microarray, cdna/est, and mpss  <cit> . more genes were detected with expression signal by custom microarray analysis  <cit> . in this study, we have identified various types of tissue-preferred genes. we have detected multiple overrepresented go terms in each type of tissue-preferred genes by gene set enrichment analysis . the results suggested that these genes might play certain roles which should be required for tissue-preferred functions. thus, tissue-preferred gene expression patterns were often used as a reference to identify functionally relevant genes  <cit> . protein domain analysis showed that many seed-preferred genes encode glutelins, cupin domain containing proteins, late embryogenesis abundant proteins, prolamins, and seed allergenic proteins and many of these proteins are mainly accumulated during seed development. thus, they showed seed-preferred expression. similar situations were also observed in leaf-, root-, and panicle-preferred genes. for example, the rice plastid sigma factor ossig <dig>  is a leaf-preferred gene  and its expression in leaves plays a role in the maintenance of photosynthetic activity  <cit> . the gene rst <dig>  was required for rice male fertility  <cit>  and therefore was only expressed in panicles . thus, tissue-preferred expression of genes would avoid unnecessary bioenergy waste which was due to the gene transcription in other tissues.

motifs from tissue-preferred genes and synthetic urss
sometimes, endogenous plant urss are not strong enough for plant transformation to obtain desirable phenotypes. by contrast, synthetic urss can be designed to be stronger. they can also be used as regulatory devices for controlling constitutive, inducible, tissue-preferred gene expression  <cit> . currently, most of synthetic urss were generated by inserting functional motifs into natural urss  <cit> . for example, the higher level activities of urss pcec  <cit>  and mac  <cit>  were constructed by introducing enhancer motifs into the upstream of native constitutive urss. although considerable synthetic urss have been generated  <cit> , most of them were constitutive or inducible urss. relatively, much less was reported on synthetic tissue-preferred urss. by investigating the overrepresented urs motifs in leaf-, root-, panicle- and seed-preferred genes, we have identified at least one tissue-preferred urs motifs. these motifs include gcngcngc for leaf-specificity, gctagcta for root-specificity, anwatata for panicle-specificity and yatatntt for seed-specificity . they were overrepresented in corresponding tissue-preferred urss. we have also further analysed the known tissue-preferred motifs for two panicle-preferred and two seed-preferred urss . thus, these motifs provide candidates for designing new tissue-preferred urss. on the other hand, the identification of these tissue-preferred urss and their motifs will benefit not only the designing of synthetic urss but also the computer prediction of expression patterns of genes in other closely related species. these, in return, may provide a reference for function annotation of these genes in the species.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have genome-widely identified root-, leaf-, panicle- and seed-preferred genes in the rice genome by comparing the expression abundance among different rice tissues. some of these tissue-preferred genes were verified through qrt-pcr expression analysis. based on these analyses, we have identified  <dig> root-preferred,  <dig> seed-preferred,  <dig> leaf-preferred and  <dig> panicle-preferred genes. in addition to these, a total of  <dig> urss were isolated and their activities were further investigated by analyzing transgenic rice plants harboring the urs::gus cassettes. the transgenic analysis revealed one young pollen preferred, one mature pollen preferred, one vascular bundle preferred and two seed-preferred urss. thus, our data might provide some evidence for gene function annotation and candidate urss for plant transgenesis.
