BACKGROUND
the thread-like parasitic nematodes wuchereria bancrafti and brugia malayi cause lymphatic filariasis  in humans. lf is a deforming and disabling neglected tropical disease. an estimated  <dig> million people in  <dig> countries are infected currently, and  <dig>  billion are at risk of acquiring the infection  <cit> . current treatments rely on a limited number of drugs, namely diethycarbamazine, albendazole and ivermectin. although these treatments are partially effective, the molecular effects of these drugs on filarial nematodes are not completely understood  <cit> . in addition, these drugs are not effective against all parasite stages. thus, treatments often must be provided annually for the full lifespan of adult parasites, which is estimated to be  <dig> to  <dig> years. in addition, recent reports suggest that the parasites may be developing resistance to albendazole and ivermectin treatment  <cit> . therefore, the search for new drug targets and effective vaccine candidates is an important priority. improved understanding of the molecular processes responsible for parasite development and survival could help to identify new drug targets for treatment of filarial infections.

filarial parasites have complex life cycles with five stages and  <dig> cuticular molts   <cit> . early larval development takes place in arthropod hosts, and further development and sexual reproduction takes place in vertebrate hosts. in the case of parasites that cause lf, infective larvae  are transmitted to humans by mosquitoes. while l <dig> are developmentally arrested in mosquitoes, they resume development after entering a suitable vertebrate host, and this leads to a molt to the fourth larval larval stage  after approximately  <dig> days. l <dig> undergo dramatic growth over a period of several weeks and then molt to become dioecious l <dig> parasites. these immature adult worms develop further over a period of approximately  <dig> weeks and become sexually mature adult worms. after mating, adult female worms produce thousands of motile microfilariae  that circulate in the bloodstream of infected hosts. when mf are ingested by a susceptible mosquito species, they migrate to the thorax and develop through two molts over approximately  <dig> days to become l <dig>  completing the life cycle. while changes in morphology across the life cycle of filarial worms are well documented  <cit> , relatively little is known about the biochemical pathways and molecular processes that accompany these developmental changes. since many of these pathways and processes must be essential for the survival of these parasites, further research in this area may lead to identification of new targets for rational design of vaccines and drugs.

recent advances in technology have provided exciting new opportunities for research on parasites. in the case of filariasis, assembly and annotation of the genome of b. malayi <cit> , studies of differential gene expression in different parasite types   <cit>  and recent proteomics studies  <cit>  have all contributed to a much deeper understanding of filarial biology. while generally informative, many of these studies were limited by insufficient surveying of different life cycle stages. the combined use of genomics, bioinformatics, and proteomics across the life cycle of b. malayi should improve our understanding of the molecular biology of molting, invasion and survival in the mammalian host, sexual differentiation, reproduction, and behavior  <cit> .

in the current study, we have provided detailed information on global transcriptional profiles for seven b. malayi lifecycle stages: infective l <dig> directly from vector mosquitoes, and several stages collected from a mammalian host  and male  and mature male  and female worms . we described transcriptional profiles associated with the dioecious and digenetic stages, and identified various sets of stage and gender-specific transcripts and transcripts that are fairly constantly expressed in all stages tested. in addition, we have related these results to recently reported data on b. malayi proteomes and to available expression data for caenorhabditis elegans.

while our study was under review, choi et al.  <cit>  reported transcriptomic expression changes across the b. malayi lifecycle using deep sequencing. the transcriptional profiles and expression dynamics revealed by these two different approaches are similar in many ways . while detailed comparisons of results from the two studies are beyond the scope of this paper, a preliminary comparison shows that both technologies were useful for characterizing transcriptomes associated with development of b. malayi. one unique aspect of our study, however, was the inclusion of sexually immature adult worms  which allowed us to investigate molecules essential for sexual development. a comprehensive comparative bioinformatics analysis allowed us to identify many b. malayi homologues of c. elegans genes essential for reproduction or developmental arrest. this information will enhance the functional annotation of filarial genomes, and it could lead to the development of novel ways of treating or controlling filariasis based on blocking biological processes that are essential for parasite development and/or survival.

RESULTS
overview of transcription profiles across the b. malayi lifecycle stages
genes with hybridization signals ≥  <dig> times the mean intensity of the negative control elements in at least  <dig> of the  <dig> hybridizations were considered to be expressed. by this criterion,  <dig>  transcripts were expressed in at least one stage/gender , and this corresponds to ~ 60% of the probes represented on the microarray. because the array includes probes from other related filarial species , we compared hybridization results for different probe sets. as expected, the percentage of expressed transcripts was higher for b. malayi transcripts  than for w. bancrofti , o. volvulus  or wolbachia  transcripts. we did not look at the stage-specific expression of wolbachia genes, because poly-a labeled probes do not efficiently hybridize wolbachia rna which does not contain poly-a. we next compared results obtained with cdna prepared from different parasite stages or sexes with those obtained with a reference cdna sample made from pooled mrna representing all of the life cycle stages studied to measure the relative abundance of transcripts in each parasite stage  <cit> . the relative abundance of transcripts over time was used to assess transcriptional profiles for each gene.

regulation of expressed transcripts was highly dynamic across the life cycle. among the expressed transcripts, 41%  of the expressed transcripts were differentially expressed  across the lifecycle stages. detailed transcriptional profiles by stage are presented in figure  <dig> 

of  <dig>  expressed transcripts, only   <dig>  were present in all life cycle stages; these transcripts were considered to be a core set of transcripts required for all stages of the parasites. of  <dig>  core transcripts,  <dig>  were differentially expressed , and  <dig>  were constantly expressed in all of the lifecycle stages tested . the constantly expressed transcripts include those previously validated and used as endogenous controls for qrt-pcr assays such as gene bmc <dig>  and gene bmc <dig>   <cit> . thus, despite major morphological differences between developmental stages, different life stages share many molecular commonalities. recent proteomics studies have shown the percentage of proteins in core proteomes varies among organisms; 15% in b. malayi <cit> ,  <dig> % in yeast and  <dig> % in humans, respectively  <cit> .

to our surprise, only 26%  of transcripts  and others that did not meet statistical criteria for de  were expressed exclusively in one of the seven lifecycle stages studied . the apparent stage-specific expression of genes is not absolute, because we cannot rule out low-level expression below the sensitivity threshold of the methods we employed.

adult females  which contain eggs and developing embryos expressed more specific transcripts than other stages . our data sets for stage-specific transcripts corroborate numerous reports of stage-specific expression of individual genes in b. malayi including serpin in mf   <cit>  and chromadorea alt protein  in l <dig>  <cit> . the current study also identified previously unrecognized stage-specific genes that may be crucial for parasite development. for example, two female-specific transcripts encode 3′ to 5′ exonucleases  that function as ‘proofreaders’ to edit mismatched nucleotides at the primer terminus. the transcript for mitosis-specific chromosome segregation protein   was also female-specific. as these genes are crucial for protein synthesis and mitosis, they are likely to be essential for female reproduction. although the expected functions of the known genes with stage specific expression identified in this study often have clear links to development, many of the stage-specific transcripts identified encode unknown or hypothetic proteins .

the general transcriptional profile of b. malayi confirms the previous hypothesis that genes which control continuous ‘house-keeping’ processes and maintain survival are constitutively expressed, while genes that have specific functions in one or more stages of development have developmentally regulated expression  <cit> . based on these results, it is clear that b. malayi parasite development requires complex controls for gene expression.

development- and function-dependent transcription patterns in b. malayi
in order to identify b. malayi genes that are developmentally regulated and to document their expression profiles, a statistical analysis was applied as described in materials and methods. we identified  <dig>  probe sets  that were differentially expressed with a false discovery rate  of 5%  when considered across the entire life cycle of b. malayi. this group of probe sets comprises 41% of all expressed probe sets on the microarray and represents genes that had significantly altered gene expression across the lifecycle . we then grouped these transcripts into five major clusters based on their temporal expression patterns using k-means clustering . brief descriptions of these clusters are provided in following sections.

cluster  <dig> includes  <dig>  transcripts with high expression in mf. 41% of these transcripts encode hypothetical or novel proteins . the cluster includes many known mf specific or enriched-genes such as serpin  <cit>  and endochitinase  <cit> . one striking finding was that transcripts encoding proteins required for protein synthesis  were enriched in this cluster. the c2h <dig> domain-containing zinc finger proteins have also been reported to be enriched in the mf proteome  <cit> . these proteins may function as transcription factors. eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4e type  <dig> also binds the 7-methylguanosine-containing mrna cap during an early step in the initiation of protein synthesis and facilitates ribosome binding by inducing the unwinding of mrna secondary structures  <cit> . enrichment of transcripts for protein synthesis in mf is consistent with the recent report of high numbers of total proteins and secretory/excretory proteins  identified in mf compared to other stages  <cit> . some of these proteins may be needed for mf survival in mammalian host and/or for infection of mosquitoes.

cluster  <dig> contains  <dig> transcripts, 46% of which encode hypothetical or novel proteins . these transcripts had peak expression in the l <dig> stage and lower expression in other stages. cluster  <dig> transcripts include most known l3-specific and/or enriched transcripts such as transcripts encoding abundant larval protein family members  and transcripts encoding members of cathepsin l-like cysteine proteinase family group ia . these well known l <dig> enriched proteins have been postulated to play crucial roles for establishment of infection and survival in mammalian hosts  <cit> . in addition,  <dig> of the  <dig> most highly upregulated transcripts in this cluster were exclusively expressed in l3;  <dig> of these encode for cathepsin l-like cysteine proteinases and cystatin .

cluster  <dig> contains  <dig> transcripts with l4-upregulated expression . these transcripts exhibited peak expression in l <dig> with gradually reduced expression in later stages. approximately 41% of the cluster  <dig> transcripts encode hypothetical or novel proteins. transcripts that encode proteins likely to be essential for parasite development and adaptation to stress in the mammalian host are abundant in the cluster. for example, transcripts encoding heat shock proteins  including small heat shock proteins  bmhsp <dig>  , bmhsp <dig>  and bmhsp  <dig>  were highly upregulated in cluster  <dig>  previous studies have shown that shsp are expressed in a developmentally regulated fashion  <cit> and are essential for intracellular protein folding to mediate protective functions under stress conditions  <cit> . recently, bmhsp <dig>  has been reported to function as a human il- <dig> receptor binding protein in vitro <cit> . in addition, transcripts encoding other stress-inducible and anti-oxidant proteins were abundant in this cluster such as the stress-inducible thioredoxin peroxidases , glutathione peroxidases , and anti-oxidant products superoxide dismutase . these proteins have also been reported to be enriched in the secretory proteome of b. malayi l <dig>  <cit> . another group of genes enriched in cluster  <dig> are transcripts for cytoskeletal filaments including microfilaments  and intermediate filaments. this is consistent with the recent report that intermediate filament protein was abundant in es products released during the l3/l <dig> transition  <cit> . enrichment of transcripts for stress-inducible, anti-oxidant, and cytoskeletal proteins in this cluster suggests that l <dig> parasites  modulate their transcriptional program for survival and growth in the mammalian host.

clustering analysis also revealed large groups of coordinately expressed genes with peak expression in af  or in am . these transcripts have high expression in 6wf or 6wm, and even higher expression in af and am, respectively. the percentages of the transcripts encoding hypothetical proteins or unknown proteins were higher in these clusters than that in other clusters . this suggests that many transcripts associated with filarial reproduction encode novel proteins without homologues in public databases. those proteins without close orthologs in humans may be potential targets for drugs that could block parasite reproduction. as expected, these two gender-associated clusters contained transcripts that encode known proteins involved in basic reproductive processes. for example, cluster four  contains female-associated genes such as caveolin , microfilarial sheath protein bmshp <dig> , and embryonic fatty acid-binding protein bmfabp . in contrast, cluster five contains prominent male-associated genes such as those that that encode major sperm protein  and pdz domain containing protein   <cit> .

we previously reported that gender-associated transcripts are more likely than other transcripts to have potential c. elegans homologues that are annotated as “oogenesis- or spermatogenesis-enriched” in global expression profiles  <cit> . this is also true for genes in cluster  <dig> and  <dig>  cluster  <dig> and  <dig> contain many more potential homologues of c. elegans genes that were linked to either oogenesis or spermetogenesis, respectively, as defined by reinke et al.  <cit>  than other clusters . this finding supports prior work that that biological functions of genes involved in core reproductive processes are highly conserved among the nematodes  <cit> .

to demonstrate that genes with similar functions have similar expression patterns, we have investigated expression patterns of gene families identified in the b. malayi genome such as genes encoding kinase, nuclear receptors and genes involved in immune modulation  <cit> . this analysis showed that the transcriptional patterns of gene families are stage-associated and that genes with similar functions were co-expressed within clusters. for example, genes that encode proteins involved in immune modulation that may protect from host attack had cluster  <dig> expression patterns with peak expression in l <dig> parasites; genes in the nuclear receptor family were abundant in female-associated cluster four; genes in kinase gene family were overrepresented in the male-associated cluster five .

the expression patterns of gene families identified in this study were consistent with previous findings, and the temporal expression patterns were consistent with their likely functions in development. for example, genes encoding protein kinases are known to be highly expressed in male nematodes  <cit> . prior studies have shown that kinase containing enzymes are important for regulating sperm maturation by post-translational modification of proteins  <cit>  and in signaling cascades in oocytes following fertilization  <cit> . likewise, high expression of the nuclear receptor gene family in female worms is consistent with prior reports  <cit>  and with a recent report that  <dig> out of  <dig> nuclear receptors identified in the insect t. castaneum play key roles in female reproduction   <cit> . a unique property of nuclear receptors that differentiates them from other receptor classes is their ability to directly interact with and control the expression of genomic dna. given their important regulatory role in various biological processes, nuclear receptors have long been considered to be potential drug targets  <cit> .

stage-associated transcriptomes identified by pairwise comparisons
the rationale behind this type of analysis is that transcriptional changes identified in pairwise comparisons may be essential for development and transition from one stage to the next. different parasite stages encounter different environments  <cit> . this requires physical and physiological changes that are accompanied by altered expression of suites of genes with functions in many biological processes such as reproduction, development, and migration in the host  <cit> . understanding these processes might help to identify new drug and vaccine targets in parasitic nematodes  <cit> . we performed five pairwise comparisons to identify transcripts essential for development and stage transition , two pairwise comparisons to identify gender-associated transcripts , and one pairwise comparison  to identify specific transcripts attributed to unique features of mf and l <dig> stages.

pair-wise comparisons focused on transcripts with significantly different expression . the percentages of differentially expressed transcripts identified in pairwise comparisons ranged from 33%  to 77% . we tabulated the numbers of transcripts differentially expressed for each pairwise comparison and the numbers of upregulated transcripts in the developmental stages that comprise each pair . the transcripts identified in these comparisons are provided in additional file  <dig>  results from the pairwise comparisons are described in further detail in the following sections.

mf, microfilariae; af, adult females; am, adult males; 6wf,  <dig> week females; 6wm,  <dig> week males; l <dig>  l <dig> stage,  <dig> weeks post infection; l <dig>  third stage infective larvae.

comparison of genes expressed in mf and l3
a comparison of expressed transcripts of mf and l <dig> stages identified more differentially expressed transcripts  than any of the other pairwise comparisons;  <dig>  and  <dig>  transcripts were upregulated in l <dig> and mf, respectively. distinct expression patterns of the cathepsin l-like cysteine proteinase family were identified in mf and l <dig> stages. transcripts that encode group ia cathepsin l- like protease enzymes bmcpl- <dig> , bmcpl- <dig>  and bmcpl- <dig>  were upregulated in l <dig>  whereas transcripts encoding the group ic cathepsin l-like protease enzymes bmcpl- <dig> , bmcpl- <dig>  and bmcpl- <dig>  were upregulated in mf. the group ia cathepsin l- like proteases were found to be highly expressed in filarial l <dig> and associated with larval molting and remodeling of the cuticle  <cit> . moreover, a recent study shows that b. malayi parasites without bm-cpl- <dig> are incapable of completing development to the l <dig> stage in mosquitoes  <cit> . however, the putative functions of the group ic cathepsin l- like protease enzymes are still poorly understood. upregulation of transcripts for these enzymes in mf may provide a new clue for understanding the function of these enzymes in filarial parasites.

enriched transcripts in the pairwise comparison are associated with key biological processes of stage-specific development, such as transition of mf and l <dig> to new host. for example, transcripts  which encode chitinase necessary for exsheathment of microfilariae  <cit>  were upregulated in mf, and l3s had higher transcription of genes that encode various types of collagen which are important components of l <dig> cuticle that may be important for protecting the parasites in the mammalian host environments. in addition, l <dig> expressed transcripts encode proteins involved in pathogenesis, parasitism, and stress resistance that facilitate establishment of infection in a mammalian host. examples include b. malayi abundant larval protein family members bmalt- <dig> and  <dig>  that may be used by invading larvae to modulate or evade host immune responses  <cit>  and l <dig> transcripts  that encode a venom allergen-like protein  associated with the transition to parasitism and highly expressed in non-activated hookworm l <dig>  <cit> .

we investigated whether l <dig> upregulated transcripts are enriched potential homologues of c. elegans dauer-regulated genes identified by wang and kim  <cit> . blast searches identified  <dig> b. malayi l <dig> upregulated transcripts that are potential homologues of c. elegans dauer-regulated genes, and  <dig> of these are further characterized as dauer-enriched genes . the dauer-enriched genes presumably may be related to dauer-specific properties such as stress resistance and longevity  <cit> . shared expression of homologous genes by c. elegans dauer larvae and filarial l <dig> may provide clues to mechanisms responsible for developmental arrest of filarial l <dig> in the arthropod host.

in addition to providing corroborating evidence for known-stage-associated genes as stated above, our results identified many transcripts for novel proteins that have not previously been associated with mf or l <dig>  information on the timing of expression of novel genes may lead to hypotheses regarding their functions that can be tested with functional genomics.

genes crucial for molting and growth are upregulated in l <dig> relative to the l3
the comparison of gene expression between l <dig> and l <dig> stages identified  <dig>  differentially expressed genes. of these,  <dig>  transcripts were upregulated in l <dig>  transcripts important for development including stress or heat inducible molecules such as heat shock proteins and anti-oxidants were highly expressed in l <dig> stage relative to the l <dig> stage. this pairwise comparison also suggested that protein synthesis is more active in l4s than in l3s, because transcripts encoding many ribosomal proteins  were enriched in l <dig> compared to the developmentally arrested vector l <dig> stage. this may be because developing l <dig> parasites require a high level of biosynthesis to make components for new cuticle as reported in c. elegans <cit> . genes encoding various collagens and structural proteins such as actin, intermediate filament, and tubulin were also more highly expressed in l <dig>  one of the upregulated collagen genes was bm1_ <dig>  an ortholog of c. elegans gene bli- <dig> <cit>  which is exclusively expressed in l <dig> in that species and plays a crucial role in molting  <cit> . in addition, gene bm1_ <dig> , was also highly expressed in b. malayi l <dig>  thus, transcription profiles appear to illustrate how filarial parasites coordinate gene expression with biological processes such as molting and growth in the mammalian host.

pairwise comparisons of sexually immature and mature worms revealed temporal differences in gender-associated gene expression
prior studies showed that 6wm and 6wf b. malayi worms  are not sexually mature and are still growing  <cit> . transcripts differentially expressed in pairwise comparisons between sequential stages  are likely to be important for sexual development. results of these comparisons were consistent with this hypothesis and with the findings of prior studies of gender-associated genes  <cit> . for example, transcripts for female-associated proteins such as high mobility binding protein and caveolin  were enriched in growing 6wf parasites and transcripts for male-associated proteins such as major sperm protein and pdz domain protein  were abundant in growing 6wm parasites relative to l <dig> larvae. likewise, transcripts for cathepsin protein gene family members bmcpl , bmcpf , bmcpz , and bmcpq  that are essential for early sexual development and early embryogenesis in b. malayi parasites  <cit>  were highly expressed in both 6wf and 6wm relative to l <dig> and adult worms .

interestingly, some of the transcriptomic changes during sexual development were quite different in females and males. many more upregulated transcripts  were found in 6wm stage than in 6wf  relative to l <dig>  these results are consistent with known temporal differences in gender development of b. malayi. prior studies have shown that sexual development occurs earlier in males than in females in b. pahangi <cit> , and spermatogenesis occurs prior to oogenesis in c. elegans hermaphrodites  <cit> .

it has been proposed that the c. elegans genome can serve as a guide to examine aspects of the biology of parasitic nematode species  <cit> , and we have shown that this comparative genomics approach has great power. when we cross-referenced upregulated transcripts in 6wf and 6wm relative to l <dig> with global expression patterns in c. elegans reported by reinke et al.  <cit> ,  <dig> potential c. elegans homologues that are germline-, spermatogenesis-, oogenesis-, or embryogenesis-enriched were identified in 6wm upregulated transcripts. in contrast, only  <dig> were identified in 6wf upregulated transcripts relative to l <dig> . again these results are consistent with the earlier sexual development of male filarial worms compared to females.

comparison of gene sets associated with development identified by clustering and by pair-wise comparison of gene expression
as expected, there was a significant overlap between the gene sets identified by these two approaches. for example,  <dig> of  <dig>  of mf enriched transcripts in cluster one  and  <dig> of  <dig> l <dig> enriched transcripts in cluster two  identified by hierarchical clustering were consistent with results obtained by pairwise comparisons, respectively. we have especially high confidence in transcription differences that were identified by both clustering and pairwise comparisons. of course, pairwise analyses tend to identify more stage-regulated genes than global expression analysis. for example, l <dig> enriched transcripts identified in the l <dig> vs. l <dig> pairwise comparison  far outnumbered the number of transcripts in cluster three .

gene ontology associations for developmentally regulated genes
a file containing all go terms across all three categories  mapped to v <dig> probes was generated and posted at nematode.net  <cit>  . the full lists of enriched go terms are provided in supplemental datasets. the significantly enriched go associations annotated in various gene sets are present in additional files, genes constitutively expressed , genes expressed in five clusters  and genes differentially expressed in pairwise comparisons .

go enriched molecular function categories for upregulated transcripts in am and af were consistent with previously reported go categories for gender enriched transcripts  <cit> . for example, am have enriched transcripts for protein tyrosine phosphatase activity  and protein kinase activity  whereas af contain enriched transcripts associated with protein synthesis such as peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity  and structural constituent of ribosome .

enriched go terms in both molecular function and biological process tended to be quite distinct in different gene sets. for example, the majority of constitutively expressed gene products have go term annotations that place their putative functional role in fundamentally important ‘house-keeping’ processes such as translation  and response to heat and stress  . the significantly enriched functional classes varied quite a bit between clusters 1– <dig> , and they were consistent with the main biological processes for corresponding life cycle stages. the prominent biological processes in cluster  <dig>  were obviously related to events in the parasites’ development and survival in the mammalian host. these included immune response  and responses to stress  for survival and glycolysis  for energy supply. coordinately, enriched molecular function classes related to biological processes in cluster  <dig> included antioxidant activity  and phosphogluconate dehydrogenase  activity . by contrast, chitin catabolic process  was one of the most significantly enriched biological processes in cluster one , and chitinase activity  was a significantly enriched molecular function assigned to transcripts in that cluster.

while enriched go annotations for clusters provide a broad view of the potential functions of molecules with stage-dependent expression patterns, go enrichments assigned to upregulated transcripts in the various pair-wise comparisons provide further insight into molecular functions and biological processes that are associated with stage-specific transitions . for example, differentially expressed transcripts in 6wf relative to l <dig> have enriched go terms with putative functional roles in the biological processes of response to stress, heat, oxidative stress and proteolysis, whereas the differentially expressed transcripts in 6wm over l <dig> have enriched go terms with potential molecular functions of protein kinase, phosphatase and transferase activity, and ribosome structure . these results suggest that  <dig> week  worms already have sex-specific transcription patterns associated with gender-associated biological processes.

comparison of b. malayi transcriptomic data with published proteomic data
the integration of transcriptomic and proteomic data is a huge challenge. until now, only a few published reports have attempted to do this on a large scale, and the results typically reveal only modest correlations between those two types of data  <cit> . with this in mind, we manually compared our transcriptome data with recently published b. malayi proteome data  <cit> . among the proteins from five lifecycle stages  identified by bennuru et al.  <cit> , 63%  had expression signals detected in the current study . obviously, the proteome study did not report proteins for many transcripts detected in the present study. these differences are not surprising given limitations of the methods and differences in timing between transcription, translation, and detection of proteins in worms.

when we compared current transcriptional and proteomic profiles described by bennuru et al.  <cit>  in more detail, one of the striking findings was that the majority of transcripts with proteomic data  were not differentially expressed across the lifecycle. this indicates that the proteins differentially expressed are less abundant in proteomic data. among the 31% of proteins that were differentially expressed , the highest percentage  was observed in cluster five . some discrepancies between stage-related transcriptional and translational profiles may be biologically relevant. for example, the major microfilarial sheath protein  encoded by gene bm-shp- <dig>  was enriched in the microfilarial proteome  <cit> , while the transcript for bmshp  was enriched in the female –enriched cluster  and not in the microfilarial cluster . these results are consistent with results from a prior in situ study that showed that bm-shp-1was exclusively expressed in the uterine epithelium of female worms with no expression signal in embryos or microfilariae  <cit> . this type of information may be critically important for selection of candidate genes for rnai experiments.

CONCLUSIONS
this study has provided detailed information on changes in gene expression across lifecycle stages of the filarial parasite b. malayi. results in the current study are consistent with findings previously reported from transcriptome studies that focused on l <dig> and sexually mature adult male and adult female worms <cit> . approximately 61% of gender-associated transcripts from our previous study  <cit>  were confirmed in the pairwise comparison of af vs. am in the current study. this consistency supports the validity of the current data, which show that gene expression is highly regulated and finely tuned across the b. malayi life cycle. some genes were expressed in all stages at fairly constant levels, while expression of other genes varied by  <dig> to 80-fold. many of these changes were consistent with parasite biology. for example, the transition of the parasite from the mosquito vector to the mammalian host was associated with increased transcription of genes involved in invasion, immune interactions, and molting, while the transition from immature to sexually mature stages disproportionately affect transcription of genes required for reproduction.

this study has provided a detailed description of transcriptional events across the life cycle of b. malayi. we have illustrated how global gene expression profiles can provide vital information on the development and biology of an important filarial parasite. transcriptome information is complementary to that produced by genome sequencing and proteomics. by identifying stage-specific transcripts and other genes that are regulated across the life cycle, this study has shed new light on mechanisms used by these highly evolved parasites to establish infections and to survive and reproduce in their hosts.
