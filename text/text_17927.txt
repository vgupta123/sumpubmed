BACKGROUND
phytohormones are central regulators of all aspects of plant life. they modulate plant development and reproduction as well as regulate responses to both biotic and abiotic environmental stresses, which are a constant challenge to plant growth and survival. different stresses trigger distinct signaling pathways: abscisic acid  is a central mediator of responses to abiotic stresses whereas salicylic acid , jasmonates  and ethylene  signaling mediate responses to invading pathogens  <cit> . a central component in phytohormone-mediated stress and defense signaling is the modulation of stomatal function. stomata regulate the gas exchange of plants by rapidly responding to environmental signals such as light, co <dig> level and changing concentrations of phytohormones  <cit> . while in response to various abiotic stresses such as drought the role of aba is central in promoting stomatal closure  <cit>  in pathogen-triggered innate immunity responses this process also requires sa  <cit> . importantly, several studies have shown that many foliar phytopathogens take advantage of stomata as natural openings when entering the plant and consequently plant mutants with more open stomata often show enhanced susceptibility to pathogens  <cit> . the recognition of pamps , such as bacterial flagellin, triggers stomatal closure, which is a central part of the innate immune response in arabidopsis  <cit> .

different hormonal pathways share both synergistic and antagonistic crosstalk. this communication is not only essential in order to reach the most efficient signaling and signal fine-tuning but also in defining the response priorities to avoid the wasting of limited resources of the plant  <cit> . for example, sa-, ja- or aba-mediated signaling pathways triggered by stress can be further modulated by other phytohormones. the role of auxin is well-characterized in plant growth and development but yet, it is also long known to antagonize the aba-induced stomatal closure  <cit> . furthermore, auxin has been shown to influence stomatal function by promoting stomatal opening and thus, enhancing the progression of pathogen infection  <cit> . additionally, auxin signaling was shown to increase disease symptoms by pathogens such as botrytis cinerea and pseudomonas syringae  <cit>  and several auxin signaling mutants demonstrate increased tolerance to different pathogens  <cit> . the antagonistic impact auxin has on sa is well characterized  <cit> . at the same time, sa-mediated defenses often repress auxin signaling, demonstrated as down-regulation of small auxin-up rna  genes, aux/iaa genes, and auxin receptor genes as well as genes related to polar auxin transport  <cit> . thus, modulation of endogenous hormone levels can considerably influence the stomatal movement and hormone signaling balance and hence, the outcome of pathogen infection.

while having different roles in plant defense, signaling pathways also share similar elements. activation of defense signaling in response to both abiotic and biotic stress involves production of reactive oxygen species . for example, both pathogen infection and ozone cause ros production in the apoplastic space of the plant cell which further induces stress tolerance and acclimation via a wide range of signaling events  <cit> .

f-box proteins are central regulatory components in many of the hormonal pathways  <cit> . in arabidopsis, there are 700 f-box proteins but many still remain without an assigned function  <cit> . among the well-characterized examples are the auxin receptor tir <dig>   <cit>  and the jasmonate receptor coi <dig>   <cit> . one of the proteins characterized for its influence on endogenous auxin balance in arabidopsis is max <dig>   <cit> . max <dig> is a member of the f-box leucin-rich repeat family of proteins, a component of the scf complex acting in the ubiquitin proteasome pathway that via ubiquitination marks proteins for destruction by the 26s proteasome  <cit> . intriguingly, the impact of max <dig> on plant auxin status is mediated via the proposed perception of a newly discovered phytohormone, strigolactone  <cit> , first identified as a germination stimulant for parasitic plants of the genera orobanche and striga   <cit> . the plant-produced strigolactones secreted from roots can stimulate plant interactions with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi  <cit> . the impact of strigolactones on plant auxin status is negative i.e. they influence polar auxin transport to control branching. max <dig>  proposed to act in strigolactone perception, participates in an scf complex that locally suppresses shoot branching and accordingly, the shoot branching phenotype of max mutants is caused by increased auxin transport capacity in the main stem  <cit> . other max-genes of the pathway, max <dig>  max <dig> and max <dig>  are associated with the biosynthesis of strigolactones, terpenoid lactones derived from the carotenoid pathway  <cit> . interestingly, the role of max <dig> expands further than just the involvement in strigolactone signaling and the regulation of auxin transport: recently it was shown to be essential in karrikin signaling  <cit> . karrikins are allelochemicals found in smoke that act by promoting seed germination and hence, they influence the early development of many plants by an unknown mechanism  <cit> .

our interest lies in the characterization of plant response to pathogens and thus, we established a reverse genetics screen of a number of yet uncharacterized f-box t-dna mutant lines in order to find new, stress-related phenetypes. to accomplish this, we screened the mutants for their ozone sensitivity. ozone exposure provides a convenient and robust tool to screen for mutants with altered stress tolerance, and plant responses to ozone and pathogens share common elements such as ros burst via the activation of apoplastic nadph oxidase  <cit> . one of the f-box protein mutants with clearly increased ozone susceptibility harbored a t-dna insertion in the max <dig> gene previously characterized for its role in strigolactone perception and thus, negative regulation of polar auxin transport  <cit> . interestingly, further characterization revealed that max <dig> is required for proper stomatal function in response to ozone, co <dig> and aba, and that the corresponding gene is also required for full resistance to pathogens in arabidopsis. furthermore, max <dig> appeared to contribute to defense against two bacterial phytopathogens with different lifestyles: max <dig> mutant lines demonstrated increased susceptibility to the hemibiotroph pseudomonas syringae and to the necrotroph pectobacterium carotovorum. this phenotype was suggested to result from more open stomatal aperture accentuated by increased sensitivity to apoplastic ros and alterations in endogenous phytohormone signaling.

RESULTS
f-box protein max <dig> is required for ozone tolerance in arabidopsis
to identify f-box genes involved in plant responses to environmental stresses we screened a collection of 60 t-dna insertion lines from the f-box protein families c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig>  for altered stress responses. this particular group was chosen since it contains, apart from many proteins with unknown function, also the proteins tir <dig>  coi <dig> and ebf <dig> and ebf <dig>  already characterized to be centrally involved in plant hormone signaling  <cit> . as a positive control we used rcd1- <dig>  mutant plants which have a well-characterized ozone sensitive phenotype  <cit> .

after 6 h exposure to 300 ppb of ozone rcd1- <dig> plants had developed distinct lesions while wild-type plants did not show any signs of damage . of the tested f-box t-dna lines, approximately  <dig> displayed varying degree of lesion formation. the line with the most distinct increase in ozone sensitivity, max2- <dig> , harbored a t-dna insertion in a gene encoding the f-box protein max <dig> , previously well characterized as a negative regulator of polar auxin transport  <cit> . interestingly, in response to ozone, the max2- <dig> plants developed clearly visible and spreading lesions . increased ozone sensitivity was observed also for max2- <dig> point mutation line  <cit>  confirming that the phenotype was indeed a result from mutation in the max <dig> gene . the observed ozone sensitivity was further confirmed by measuring the ion leakage from the max <dig> mutants and wild-type plants at time points  <dig>   <dig> and 24 h after beginning of ozone exposure . in max <dig> mutants the ion leakage was clearly higher compared to wild-type plants. these results strongly indicate that max <dig> contributes to ozone tolerance in arabidopsis.figure  <dig>

plants are highly susceptible to ozone. soil grown four weeks old wild-type col- <dig>  max <dig> point mutation , salk  and rcd1- <dig>  lines were exposed to 350 ppb ozone  for 6 h in a controlled o <dig> chamber. the plants were photographed before and 1 day after o <dig> exposure in order to show cell death on the leaves. a) non-treated col- <dig>  max2- <dig>  max2- <dig> and rcd1- <dig> lines grown in clean air. b) o <dig> phenotype of col- <dig>  max2- <dig>  max2- <dig> and rcd1- <dig> lines 1 day after 6 h o <dig> exposure. c) ion leakage in col- <dig>  max2- <dig>  max2- <dig> and rcd1- <dig> lines measured at different time points after o <dig> exposure indicating the amount of cell death. the result is presented as ratio of ion leakage of total ion concentration. data represent the means ± se of  <dig> independent experiments with  <dig> plants/line in every time point in each experiment. **p <  <dig> ; two-tailed t test.



max <dig> provides tolerance to apoplastic o2•−
production of reactive oxygen species  is a common response to environmental stresses in plants and accordingly, also ozone is known to trigger the production of superoxide  in the apoplastic space of plant cells leading to formation of visible lesions in sensitive plants  <cit> . since the impaired function of max <dig> had led to increased ozone sensitivity, we wanted to further investigate the contribution of ros in the observed lesion formation in max <dig> plants. to address this we employed the extracellular o2•− generating system, xanthine /xanthine oxidase   <cit> . we infiltrated the leaves of wild-type and max <dig> plants with x/xo and the resulting cell death was measured as relative ion leakage and monitored for 24 h. again, rcd1- <dig> plants that are known to be sensitive to extracellular ros  <cit>  were included as positive controls.

interestingly, in accordance with the observed sensitivity to ozone , the accumulation of o2•− led to increased ion leakage in both max <dig> mutant lines in comparison to wild-type . in x/xo-infiltrated max <dig> mutant lines the ion leakage increased 25% during the first hour while in wild type the corresponding increase was 15% . increase in ion leakage was even more distinct during the next 12 h. since x/xo –experiment is done by infiltrating and thus, is independent of stomatal opening, it seems that max <dig> influences plant sensitivity to ros in the level of mesophyll.figure  <dig> 
superoxide  induced cell death in
max2
mutants. detached leaves from four week old soil grown wild-type col- <dig>  max2- <dig>  max2- <dig> and rcd1- <dig> mutant plants were infiltrated with the o2•− generating system xanthine and xanthine oxidase . cell death was measured as relative ion leakage for 24 h. data are means ± se from  <dig> independent experiments with > <dig> leaves/line in each experiment. the result is presented as ratio of ion leakage of total ion concentration.



to further characterize the nature of the decreased ros tolerance observed in max <dig> mutant lines, we tested if these lines were also more sensitive to methyl viologen that generates ros inside the chloroplasts. also here, rcd1- <dig> plants tolerant to methyl viologen were included as controls  <cit> . however, no difference was observed in the methyl viologen tolerance of max <dig> mutant lines in comparison to wild-type plants . thus, these results indicate that max <dig> specifically contributes to apoplastic o2•− tolerance in arabidopsis.

max <dig> influences stomatal conductance in arabidopsis
both ozone as well as pathogens can enter the plant apoplast via natural openings such as stomata  <cit> . we hypothesized that besides increased sensitivity to apoplastic ros, the sensitivity of max <dig> plants to ozone could be partly due to altered stomatal function. to validate this hypothesis we first measured stomatal conductance of max <dig> and wild-type plants with a porometer. indeed, under normal growth conditions the stomata of max <dig> mutant plants were significantly more open in comparison to those of wild-type plants .figure  <dig> 
impaired stomatal function in
max2
mutants. four-week old wild-type col- <dig> and max <dig> lines were assessed for their stomatal function. a) stomatal conductance of four-week old non-treated col- <dig>  max2- <dig> and max2- <dig> plants were measured with a porometer. for each line  <dig> plants were used in each experiment and the results are shown as means ± se. experiments were repeated  <dig> times with similar results. **p <  <dig> ; two-tailed t test. b) four-week old soil-grown col- <dig> and max <dig> plants’ fresh weight change was measured by cutting the leaves and leaving them to dry for 4 h. for each line  <dig> plants were used in each experiment and the results are shown as means ± se. experiments were repeated  <dig> times with similar results.



additionally, we monitored the fresh weight change of excised leaves, which also reflects the amount of gas exchange and water loss from the plant to the atmosphere. this was done by comparing the weight change in wild-type and max <dig> mutant plants for 4 h. in concert with the results from the porometer measurement, the percentual fresh weight loss of max <dig> plants was significantly larger than that of wild-type plants , which further indicates a role for max <dig> in stomatal regulation.

the enhanced stomatal conductance of max <dig> mutants was verified by measuring stomatal conductance of non-treated and ozone exposed max <dig> plants with a custom made gas-exchange device  <cit> . in agreement with the porometer measurement, the basal level of stomatal conductance before the ozone exposure was two times higher in the max <dig> mutant lines than that observed in wild-type plants . however, the application of o <dig>  induced rapid stomatal closure in both max <dig> mutant and wild-type plants. interestingly, a slight recovery of stomatal conductance was observed after the closure in wild-type plants, but not in max <dig> plants . this could be explained by the rapid, o3-triggered induction of cell death in max <dig> mutants, further supported by the quick decrease of general photosynthesis  in these plants . while the ozone-induced stomatal closure of max <dig> plants was as rapid as that detected in wild-type plants , the intake of ozone still remained higher  due to the higher stomatal conductance at the beginning of the ozone exposure. stomatal o <dig> uptake rate of max <dig> mutants was higher compared to col- <dig>  probably due to more open stomata.figure  <dig> 
max <dig> controls the basal level of stomatal conductance. effects of 3 h 350 nmol/mol o <dig> exposure on stomatal conductance were measured on wild-type col- <dig> and max <dig> mutants with a custom made whole-rosette gas exchange measurement device. a) stomatal conductance before, during and after 3 h o <dig> exposure of col- <dig> and max <dig> plants. b) co <dig> uptake rate of max <dig> mutants and col- <dig> before, during and after 3 h o <dig> exposure. c) cumulative dose of o <dig> absorbed by max <dig> and col- <dig> plants before, during and after 3 h o <dig> exposure. d) stomatal o <dig> uptake rate of max <dig> mutants and col- <dig>  for each line  <dig> plants were used in the experiment and the results are shown as means ± se. experiments were repeated twice with similar results.



aba is a well-known regulator of stomatal closure and plant drought responses  <cit> . the more open stomata as well as increased water-loss of the max <dig> plants  suggested alterations in aba-reponses and thus, it was of interest to elucidate if the stomatal response to this phytohormone was altered in these plants. interestingly, this was not the case since max <dig> plants displayed wild-type stomatal closure in response to 5 μm aba sprayed onto intact plants  indicating that at whole plant level max <dig> contributes to the basal level of stomatal conductance rather than to stomatal closure induced by aba and ozone.

max <dig> contributes to resistance to bacterial, but not fungal pathogens
the clearly altered stomatal phenotype implied that impaired expression of max <dig> gene could have an impact on pathogen tolerance in arabidopsis. to elucidate this, we first investigated the susceptibility of max <dig> mutant lines to the virulent bacterial hemibiotroph p. syringae dc <dig>  to this aim we spray-inoculated max <dig> mutant lines and wild-type plants with the pathogen and followed the symptom development and bacterial growth in planta for five days. interestingly, max <dig> mutant plants displayed clearly enhanced susceptibility to p. syringae observed both as heavy yellowing of the infected leaves as well as increased growth of the bacteria in the apoplast . to further define the role of max <dig> in pathogen responses, we employed another type of pathogen, a bacterial necrotroph p. carotovorum, the causal agent of bacterial soft rot  <cit> . interestingly, spray inoculation of the plants with p. carotovorum also resulted in enhanced disease development in the max <dig> mutant lines seen as more extensive tissue maceration when compared to wild-type plants  indicating that the defense-associated role of max <dig> is not dependent on the pathogen lifestyle.figure  <dig> 
max2
mutant lines have decreased resistance to spray inoculated
p. syringae
and
p. carotovorum
. soil-grown four-week old plants were used to evaluate pathogen tolerance. in each experiment, three plants/line and three leaves/plant were used to check phenotype and to measure the bacterial concentration. all the experiments were repeated at least  <dig> times with similar results. the results are shown as means ± se. . a) phenotype of four week old wild-type col- <dig> and max <dig> mutants after p.syringae infection with the concentration of 1x <dig> cfu/ml. picture was taken 5 days post inoculation. upper row shows non-treated plants and lower row p. syringae infected plants. b) growth of p. syringae in planta was calculated at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 96 h after inoculation. c) phenotype of max <dig> mutant lines after infection with p.carotovorum. picture was taken 2 days post inoculation. d) growth of p. carotovorum in planta  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 48 h after infection.



to assess if the infection method had any impact on the observed disease phenotype, we did local inoculations with p. syringae  and p. carotovorum , thereby providing the bacteria a direct route to plant apoplast. intriguingly, when p. syringae was applied by infiltration method, slightly enhanced susceptibility was still observed in max <dig> mutant lines. the same was observed after infection with p. carotovorum, max <dig> plants demonstrated slight increase in the susceptibility in comparison to wild-type . the distinct difference observed in pathogen susceptibility resulting from the different inoculation methods indicated that the stomatal phenotype of max <dig> plants  has a central impact on the outcome of the infection i.e. more open stomata of max <dig> mutant plants increase bacterial entry to the apoplast of these plants.

the evident contribution of max <dig> in resistance to bacterial pathogens prompted us to elucidate whether this was also the case in plant defense to fungal pathogens. to test this, we infected max <dig> and wild-type plants with botrytis cinerea, a fungal necrotroph and followed the symptom development for three days. interestingly, opposite to observations with p. carotovorum and p. syringae, no difference could be observed in susceptibility between the max <dig> lines and wild-type plants for b. cinerea . this indicates that the difference observed in the susceptibility of max <dig> lines to different pathogens results from the enhanced capability of the bacterial pathogens to take advantage of the impaired stomatal function of max <dig> lines  when entering the plant apoplast.

max <dig> is required for pathogen-triggered stomatal closure
stomatal closure in response to invading bacteria such as p. syringae is a well-described component of the innate immunity response in arabidopsis  <cit> . the more open stomatal aperture in the absence of stress  and the enhanced susceptibility of max <dig> plants to spray-inoculated p. syringae  indicated that the pathogen-triggered stomatal closure could be impaired in these plants. to elucidate this, we infected max <dig> and wild-type plants with p. syringae bacterial suspension and checked stomatal response to living bacterial cells  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 4 h after inoculation using fluorescence microscopy using the method introduced by chitrakar and melotto  <dig>  <cit> . when max <dig> and wild-type leaves were incubated with p. syringae stomatal closure was triggered in wild-type plants1h after infection but this was not observed in max <dig> lines where the stomatal opening was rather getting higher during measured time points . p. syringae dc <dig> has been shown to induce re-opening of the stomata from  <dig> to 4 h after the initial closure by secreting the phytotoxin coronatine  <cit> . while this was observed for the wild-type at 4 h time point, in max <dig> plants the stomatal aperture was even larger  <dig> and 4 h after the infection . treatment of max <dig> and wild-type leaves with mgcl <dig> buffer solution did not alter the stomatal aperture, but yet, the stomata of max <dig> plants were clearly more open compared to wild-type . these results clearly indicate that max <dig> plants have impaired stomatal closure in response to p. syringae allowing increased numbers of bacteria to enter plant apoplast  leading to more severe susceptibility.figure  <dig>

max <dig> plants exhibit increased expression of genes triggered by oxidative stress in response to ozone and p. syringae
the enhanced sensitivity of max <dig> mutants to apoplastic ros  suggested that max <dig> could be involved in responses to oxidative stress. since both ozone and pathogen infection trigger apoplastic ros formation, we wanted to study the induction of ros-responsive genes in max <dig> and wild-type plants in response to these stresses. for this, we first characterized the expression of grx <dig> encoding a glutaredoxin family protein, that is an early ros responsive gene and is also triggered by ozone  <cit> . ozone triggered overall higher expression of grx <dig> than p. syringae but in both cases the induction of this gene was clearly higher in max <dig> than in wild-type plants . we also characterized the expression of oxidative stress marker gene gst <dig>   <cit>  in response to p. syringae. similarly to grx <dig> the accumulation of gst <dig> transcripts was also enhanced in max <dig> plants when compared to wild-type plants but to higher level . these observations suggest that max <dig> plants might be more sensitive to ros and that max <dig> is involved in oxidative stress responses.figure  <dig> 
the expression of oxidative stress marker genes in
max2
lines is upregulated. mature leaves of 4-week old soil grown wild-type col- <dig> and max <dig> plants were collected at indicated time points after p. syringae dc <dig> infection and rna was extracted to check the relative expression of oxidative stress marker gene grx <dig> after 350 ppb for 6 h ozone exposure  and after pathogen infection . another oxidative stress marker gene gst1
 and auxin-responsive gene hat2
 also checked after pathogen infection. for this analysis,  <dig> plants/line and  <dig> leaves/plant were used in each time point of infection and ozonation. each expression analysis is based on a minimum of  <dig> independent experiments. asterisks indicate significant differences, as determined by student’s t-test .



moreover, the expression of hat <dig>  an auxin-responsive homeobox-leucine zipper gene has been shown to decrease in response to ozone-triggered ros  <cit> . therefore, it was of interest to check if the expression of this gene was altered in max <dig> plants where auxin homeostasis was modulated and same was indicated for ros responses . similarly to blomster et al.  <dig>  <cit>  the levels of hat <dig> were decreased in wild-type plants in response to ozone and it was even slightly lower in max <dig> in the early timepoints . however, p. syringae triggered expression of hat <dig> was clearly lower in max <dig> when compared to wild-type plants . the decreased induction of this gene in max <dig> plants might be an indication of altered responsiveness to apoplastic ros in these plants.

the expression of the ros responsive genes grx <dig>  gst <dig> and hat <dig> suggested that the sensitivity to apoplastic ros might have altered in max <dig> plants. therefore, we wanted to further clarify whether max <dig> indeed influences the the sensitivity to or rather the cellular level of ros we performed o2•− and h2o <dig> stainings after ozone exposure and p. syringae infection. these semiquantitative stainings did not reveal visible differences between wild-type and max <dig> mutant lines . the lack of enhanced ros production further underlines that the enhanced gene expression triggered by oxidative stress is likely to be due to altered ros-sensitivity in max <dig> plants.

expression of auxin receptor genes is downregulated in max <dig> plants
max <dig> has been shown to negatively regulate polar auxin transport in arabidopsis i.e. auxin transport is increased in max <dig> mutants  <cit> . furthermore, the expression of saur-genes is enhanced in max <dig> plants indicating increased auxin response  <cit> . auxin homeostasis has been shown to influence some plant-pathogen interactions  <cit>  and interestingly, also max <dig> mutants were more sensitive to phytopathogens than wild-type plants. thus, we wanted to explore whether auxin-related gene expression was also altered in max <dig> plants in response to p. syringae dc <dig>  suprisingly, we noticed that the expression of the auxin receptor genes auxin signaling f-box protein <dig>  and transport inhibitor response <dig>  was altered in max <dig> lines in comparison to wild-type plants. while p. syringae triggered afb <dig> induction in wild-type plants, this was not observed in max <dig> plants . furthermore, tir <dig> expression was decreased in max <dig> plants already before pathogen inoculation and remained in significantly lower level than in wild-type during the course of infection . this could reflect the attempt of the plant to reduce the increased auxin response by downregulating the expression of the corresponding receptors.figure  <dig>

max2
lines are downregulated. leaves from 4-week old soil grown wild-type col- <dig> and max <dig> line plants were collected at indicated time points after p. syringae dc <dig> infection and used to extract rna to check the relative expression of auxin marker genes, afb1
 and tir1
. for this analysis,  <dig> plants/line and  <dig> leaves/plant were used. results are based on a minimum of  <dig> independent experiments. asterisks indicate significant differences, as determined by student’s t-test .



phytohormone levels are altered in max <dig> mutant plants
to correlate the changes seen in stomatal phenotype and susceptibility to pathogens with possible alterations in endogenous hormone levels of max <dig>  we measured the accumulation of aba and sa  in non-stressed growth conditions,  aba-level after the leaves were excised and left to dry and   and sa-level after p. syringae infection . interestingly, aba levels in the max <dig> mutant plants were higher already 30 min after excising the leaves and remained higher than in the leaves of wild-type plants until 4 h reflecting the increased water loss of max <dig> plants .figure  <dig> 
altered phytohormone levels in col- <dig> and
max2
mutant lines. hormone levels in max <dig> mutant plants were measured in response to both drought  for aba and pathogen infection  for sa. the results shown are representative of both max <dig> mutant lines. a) aba levels of max <dig> mutant plants in response to drought. the values are means ± se of  <dig> independent experiments with  <dig> biological repeats in each experiment. asterisks indicate significant differences, as determined by student’s t-test . b) the leaves of 4-week old col- <dig> and max <dig> mutant plants were inoculated with p. syringae and collected for analysis of sa level. the values are means ± se of  <dig> independent experiments with  <dig> biological repeats in each experiment. asterisks indicate significant differences, as determined by student’s t- test .



both p. syringae and p. carotovorum trigger sa-dependent defense signaling in arabidopsis  <cit> . therefore, it was intriguing to determine, if the accumulation of endogenous sa was altered in max <dig> plants in response to p. syringae and would contribute to the increased susceptibility of the plants. interestingly, the only significant difference in pathogen-triggered sa-level between max <dig> mutant and wild-type was 24 h after pathogen inoculation when the accumulation of sa was clearly higher in max <dig> plants . this could reflect the response of the plants to the dramatic increase in bacterial growth observed in planta at the same time .

expression of sa related marker gene pr <dig> is upregulated in max <dig> plants
sa is known to contribute to the resistance to p. carotovorum and p. syringae  <cit> . considering the decreased pathogen resistance of max <dig> plants, in addition to the stomatal phenotype, the impact of possibly altered defense signaling could not be ruled out. to further explore the cause for the obvious decrease in plant resistance we characterized the expression of both sa- and ja-pathway marker genes in response to p. syringae infection. the expression of the marker gene for sa-dependent defense signaling, pr <dig>  was significantly upregulated in wild-type plants 48 h after the spray inoculation. however, in max <dig> mutant plants pr <dig> was clearly induced already at 24 h and interestingly, at 48 h the expression of this gene was at least twice as high in max <dig> as that observed in wild-type plants . the expression of pr <dig> clearly indicates that the activation of sa-dependent defenses is enhanced in max <dig> plants. intriguingly, despite this max <dig> plants are more susceptible to p. carotovorum and also p. syringae that should be contained by sa-mediated defense signaling.figure  <dig>

while not central in defense to p. syringae or p. carotovorum in arabidopsis, ja-dependent defense can still modulate the outcome of the interaction between these pathogens and arabidopsis  <cit> . therefore, in order to see if ja signaling was altered in max <dig> lines and thus, would in its part influence the decreased resistance of these plants we examined the expression of ja-related marker genes hel  and vsp <dig>   <cit>  after inoculation with p. syringae. we could not observe any difference in the expression of these marker genes between max <dig> and wild-type plants  and conclude that ja does not contribute to the altered pathogen responses of max <dig> plants.

discussion
there are over 700 f-box proteins in arabidopsis the majority of which are still without an assigned function  <cit> . since our interest lies in the characterization of plant response to environmental stresses, we wanted to identify yet uncharacterized f-box proteins with roles related to plant stress tolerance/disease resistance. we exposed several arabidopsis f-box t-dna insertion lines to ozone and the one with most distinct sensitive phenotype showing extensive tissue damage harbored the t-dna insertion in max <dig> gene . the f-box protein max <dig> , a negative regulator of polar auxin transport has earlier been shown to influence different processes, including strigolactone and karrikin signalling, auxin signaling and plant development, senescence, photomorphogenesis and responses to abiotic, such as drought and salt stresses in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . here, we further expand the role of max <dig> and provide evidence that it is also involved in biotic stress responses. our results suggest that the increased susceptibility of max <dig> plants to the phytopathogens pseudomonas syringae and pectobacterium carotovorum results from more open stomatal aperture and is further enhanced by decreased tolerance to stress-triggered apoplastic ros and altered regulation of defense signaling.

ozone enters plant cells via stomata and thus, triggers stomatal closure in the exposed plants  <cit> . therefore, the increased ozone sensitivity of max <dig> plants indicated alterations in the regulation of stomatal aperture of these plants. indeed, measurements with both a porometer and a custom made gas-exchange device  <cit>  indicated that the stomatal conductance of max <dig> plants was higher than in wild-type in non-stressed conditions . the altered stomatal phenotype is also supported by studies of bu et al.  <dig>  <cit>  who, similarly to us  show that the water loss from excised leaves is greater in max <dig> than in wild-type plants. interestingly, ha et al.  <dig>  <cit>  observe no difference between the stomatal aperture of max <dig> and wild-type in the absence of stress but show that the stomatal closure of max <dig> plants in response to aba is reduced. this is contradictory to our results showing that max <dig> plants have wild-type like stomatal closure in response to aba . there could be several explanations for different results obtained for aba responsiveness of max <dig> mutants. we measured quick  changes in stomatal conductance in response to single spraying of intact plants with 5 μm aba, whereas ha et al.  <dig>  <cit>  and bu et al.  <dig>  <cit>  provide data about stomatal aperture changes in epidermal peels after 1–2 h of incubation in 10 μm aba buffer. additionally, also the density of stomata can influence the conductance. whether this applies to max <dig> plants remains to be solved: according to ha et al.  <dig>  <cit>  max <dig> mutants have increased stomatal density while bu et al.  <dig>  <cit>  observe no such difference.

after entering the apoplast ozone degrades into o2 
•– and h2o <dig>  and causes the activation of nadph oxidase leading to further ros formation  <cit> . thus, in addition to the increased intake, the ozone sensitivity of plants can also originate from impaired cellular responses to stress-triggered ros. the excessive damage observed in the leaves of max <dig> plants in response to ozone could indicate that the level of cellular ros possibly exceeds the capacity of the plant antioxidant systems. this is further underlined by the rapid decrease in the amount of general photosynthesis measured in max <dig> plants . also, the expression of ozone and ros induced gene grx <dig>  <cit>  was increased in max <dig> indicating enhanced ozone response . moreover, the tolerance of max <dig> lines to extracellular o2 
•– generated by the xanthine/xanthine oxidase  system was clearly decreased in comparison to that of wild-type plants . this suggests that the induction of extracellular o2 
•– could trigger an ongoing production of ros in max <dig> lines that subsequently leads to increased damage.

plant response to ozone and invading pathogens share some strikingly similar elements. both ozone and bacterial pathogens enter the plant interior via stomata  <cit>  and therefore, it was of great interest to test if the increased stomatal conductance observed in max <dig> lines had any influence on the pathogen tolerance of the plants. indeed, spray-inoculation with either the hemibiotroph pseudomonas syringae or the necrotroph pectobacterium carotovorum led to more severe disease development in max <dig> lines compared to wild-type plants. furthermore,when the plants were infected by applying the bacteria directly to apoplast  max <dig> plants were still more susceptible but the difference to wild-type judging either by visual symptoms or bacterial numbers was significantly smaller in comparison to what was observed after spray inoculation  . this strongly suggested that while other factors might also contribute, the more open stomatal aperture of max <dig> plants has a central role in the increased susceptibility to both of these pathogens and that also the pathogen-triggered stomatal closure might be impaired in these plants. indeed, this was confirmed when we observed that the well-described p. syringae-triggered stomatal closure described in arabidopsis  <cit>  was absent in max <dig> plants . on the contrary, it seemed that instead of closure, p. syringae inoculation induced increase in stomatal opening in max <dig> plants.

similarly to ozone also pathogen invasion triggers apoplastic ros burst originating from nadph oxidase and peroxidases  <cit> . in pathogen responses, one function of the early produced ros is its antimicrobial activity - it can be directly harmful to the invading pathogen  <cit> . however, the enhanced susceptibility of the max <dig> plants did not suggest strongly increased ros levels and accordingly, semiquantitative data on ros accumulation did not show increase in either superoxide or h2o <dig> levels in these plants in response to pathogens or ozone . ros homeostasis is central in plants and for this, they possess a network of components of both ros-producing and ros-scavenging systems to secure appropriate ros levels and at the same time minimize possible toxic effects of ros  <cit> . interestingly, despite the lack of increase in the pathogen-triggered ros accumulation in the max <dig> plants the induction of ros-responsive gsti and grnx <dig> genes triggered by p. syringae infection was clearly enhanced in comparison to wild-type  indicating a stronger response to ros. also, the expression of auxin-responsive hat <dig> gene has earlier been shown to be downregulated by apoplastic ros  <cit>  and in comparison to wild-type, this gene is clearly less expressed in max <dig> plants in response to both pathogens and ozone . this together with the ozone and x/xo-generated o2 
•– -triggered damage in max <dig> plants indicates that rather than enhanced accumulation, these plants might have decreased tolerance to ros which further results in increased tissue damage.

however, after entry to the plant apoplast pathogen recognition triggers different lines of plant defenses, central of which is the activation of distinct defense signaling pathways mediated by different phytohormones such as sa, ja and ethylene  <cit> . the activation of these responses is further modulated by other phytohormones including auxin  <cit> . auxin has for long been recognized as a central regulator of plant growth but its role as a modulator of plant defense responses to both abiotic and biotic stresses is getting more attention  <cit> . for example, it is well established that auxin and sa-mediated signaling are mutually antagonistic while auxin and ja signaling often seem to share synergism  <cit> . modulation of auxin transport has been shown to influence activation of the sa dependent defenses. when the expression of a negative regulator of auxin transport, bud1/mkk <dig> , was downregulated with rnai the induction of sar and resistance to pathogens was compromised in arabidopsis  <cit> . intriguingly, max <dig> is a negative regulator of polar auxin transport in arabidopsis  <cit>  and the increased expression of auxin response marker genes, such as saurs in max <dig> plants  <cit>  indicates enhanced auxin responses. plant defense against both p. carotovorum and p. syringae in arabidopsis is dependent on sa-signaling, and therefore, it was of interest to elucidate if the modulated auxin status of max <dig> plants had any impact on the activation of sa-responses. surprisingly, the only major difference between wild-type and max <dig> plants in the expression of sa-dependent marker gene pr <dig> was  <dig> and 48 h after p. syringae infection . there, especially at 48 h timepoint, the expression of pr <dig> was clearly enhanced in max <dig> plants, which was unexpected considering the increased susceptibility of these plants to p. syringae. however, at this point even the enhanced induction of sa-signaling is not enough to limit the massively spreading infection in max <dig> plants.

polar auxin transport is increased in max <dig> plants which could be speculated to lead to downregulation of sa-responses similarly to bud <dig> mutant  <cit> . however, if the role of increased auxin transport had a major role in downregulating sa-response for example during the early hours of infection in max <dig> plants thus increasing the susceptibility then higher expression of pr <dig> should have been observed in wild-type plants and this was not the case . at this time the reason for increased sa accumulation and enhanced pr <dig> expression observed  <dig> and 48 h after bacterial inoculation in max <dig> lines remains elusive.

based on our results, we show that max <dig> contributes to biotic stress resistance in arabidopsis and thus, expand the already established role of max <dig> in developmental and abiotic stress responses. resistance to the phytopathogens p. carotovorum and p. syringae is clearly compromised in max <dig> mutants. we propose that the decreased resistance of max <dig> plants results mainly from more open stomatal aperture but is further accentuated by the decreased tolerance of these plants to stress-triggered ros and by altered defense signaling possibly influenced by enhanced auxin responses. indeed, auxin has been shown to promote stomatal opening and thus, enhance the progression of the disease  <cit> .

the exact molecular mechanism how max <dig> mediates these events requires more detailed molecular studies, for example identification target proteins and thus, remains a subject for future studies.

CONCLUSIONS
our results show that max <dig> previously characterized for its role in the regulation of polar auxin transport and thus, plant development in arabidopsis also significantly influences plant disease resistance. our data reveals that increased susceptibility of max <dig> plants to pseudomonas syringae and pectobacterium carotovorum is due to increased stomatal conductance leading to enhanced pathogen entry into the plant apoplast. moreover, max <dig> plants were shown to have decreased tolerance to apoplastic ros showing that max <dig> is also required for the regulation of ros-induced cell death at mesophyll level. the activation of defense signaling in response to pathogens is also altered in max <dig> plants, presumably resulting from perturbations in the auxin homeostasis of these plants.
