BACKGROUND
alternative splicing is the major source of proteomic diversity in vertebrates . it occurs in more than 90% of human genes and plays important roles in cell function and the development of diseases . the usage of alternative exons is tightly regulated in cells in a spatial and temporal manner by cis-acting rna elements and trans-acting factors  <cit> . cis-acting elements have been identified around or overlapping with motifs of the splice sites. it is however very rare for a de novo regulatory element to exist between the polypyrimidine tract and 3′ag of the 3′ splice site , apparently due to the constrained sequence and space of the motifs for proper splicing .

the 3′ splice sites at the end of introns have a highly conserved arrangement of consensus sequence nnyag  <cit> , where the polypyrimidine tract  is close to the 3′ ag for the binding of the heterodimmeric u2af <dig> and u2af <dig>  <cit> , respectively. the space between the n and 3′ ag is highly constrained: simply increasing the distance weakens splice site usage  <cit> .

we have shown previously that a ca-rich element called carre <dig> is within this 3′ss space and bound by hnrnp l to regulate depolarization-induced splicing , but it is not clear whether a purine-rich element could be tolerated at this location. one group of the well-characterized purine-rich splicing regulatory elements are guanidine  tracts containing a minimal functional g3
 <cit> , mostly as silencers in exons or enhancers in introns . here we searched the human genome for such potential elements and report the identification and characterization of a large group of g tracts between the n and 3′ ag, which we call with other elements at this special location repa .

RESULTS
repa g tracts within a group of human 3′ss
to determine if there are purine-rich repa like the carre <dig>  we searched the 3′ss of annotated introns in the human genome for those with >60% a/g content within the -10 ~ - <dig> nucleotides of the intron end , a length sufficient to harbor a splicing regulatory rna element. this identified  <dig>  unique 3′ss of 3′ag introns. on average, the a/g content between the - <dig> and - <dig> positions is about 70% compared to only about 20% for that of constitutive exons . at the - <dig> and - <dig> positions, the a/g content is also higher, about 40% over the constitutive ones. overall, the a/g content between the - <dig> and - <dig> positions is significantly higher  than that of constitutive exons.figure  <dig>

to identify consensus elements, we examined the nucleotides - <dig> to -3 nt to allow for a maximal  <dig> upstream nucleotides to form elements with the search target sequence. these sequences were subject to the meme  analysis as reported previously  <cit> . this identified g-rich motifs, among others , as one of the top consensus elements.figure  <dig>

the repa g-tracts are highly associated with alternative splicing
to determine the strength of the splice sites containing the purine-rich elements, we calculated their maxentscan entropy scores, as described by yeo and burge  <cit> . the scores are significantly lower than the  <dig> 3′ss randomly chosen from the human genome, with those containing the g pentamer and ggaaa among the lowest . therefore, the purine-rich repa likely weakens the 3′ss.

to determine whether these 3′ss are associated with alternative splicing, we examined some of the repa-containing 3′ss and their downstream exons of human mrna or expressed sequence tags  in the ucsc genome browser. the abundance of associated alternative splicing showed a general trend consistent with entropy scores, for example, higher abundance among exons with 3′ss containing the g pentamer . however, further comparison among three groups of 3′ss  with similarly low entropy scores  indicated that not all of them were associated with higher abundance of alternative splicing. for instance, the gaaaa group had only about half of the g pentamer group in the abundance. thus, specific purine sequences are likely also associated with the high abundance of alternative splicing.

we then chose to focus on the repa g tracts. we examined in total  <dig> repa g3–8-harboring 3′ss and found  <dig> of them  associated with alternative splicing events . the first g mainly starts between the - <dig> and - <dig> positions , and about 99% of them are g3– <dig> 

major types of the associated alternative splicing events include alternative 3′ss or 5′ss usage, cassette exon and intron retention . of these, intron retention has the most enrichment, about  <dig> times of that surveyed in the human transcriptomes of different tissues  <cit> . the other enriched type is alternative 3′ splice . examples of these types of alternative splicing and their g tracts are shown in figure 3b: the alternative 3′ splicing of the exon  <dig> of pax <dig> , alternative 5′ splicing of the exon  <dig> of myh <dig> , skipped exon   <dig> of abcc <dig> , member 11) and retained intron  <dig> of trerf <dig> .figure  <dig>

the repa g-tracts are splicing silencers
to determine the role of the g-tracts in alternative splicing, we examined four repa g tract-harboring 3′ss by transferring them to the upstream of a constitutive exon derived from the human beta-globin gene . three of them almost abolished the usage of the immediate downstream  3′ag and activated substantial usage of a further downstream cryptic 3′ss within the exon or caused exon skipping . the other one reduced the proximal 3′ag usage by about  <dig> % . importantly, mutating the gs to as of the repa g tracts almost completely  or partially  restored the usage of the proximal 3′ag, accompanied by abolished , reduced  or increased  cryptic splicing. this suggests that the g tracts are more than just a purine-rich spacer between the py and 3′ag, which also weakens the 3′ splice site . the g tracts inhibit the usage of proximal 3′ag but often activate distal 3′ag, consistent with their increased association with alternative 3′ss  and the dependence of the effect on their location relative to the target splice site. moreover, the Δgs of the potential secondary structures caused by the mutations, as tested by mfold  <cit> , do not correlate with the splicing changes, suggesting that the mutation effect is not due to a secondary structural change. therefore, we conclude that all four repa g tracts tested are splicing silencers with the gs playing critical roles.

in order to examine the role of known g tract-binding factors hnrnp h/f in splicing through the repa g tracts, we carried out rna interference assays . two of the reporters pax <dig> and pak <dig> almost completely lost the g tract silencer effect upon knockdown of hnrnp h/f  whereas the other two exhibited about  <dig> % and  <dig> % decrease in exon skipping . this is accompanied by abolished , reduced  or increased  level of the cryptic splice product. notably, the mutated mini-genes showed almost no change in exon skipping  except one that showed about  <dig> % decrease  but still  <dig> % less than its wild type. the mutants also showed reduced cryptic splicing in the cases of prmt <dig> and grk <dig> , suggesting that usage of the cryptic splice sites are also affected by other hnrnp h/f target element in the reporter. hence, the silencer effect of repa g tract on exon skipping or its activation of cryptic 3′ss usage is mainly through hnrnp h/f.

to further validate the g tract silencer effect on splicing of endogenous exons, we used rna interference of hnrnp h/f in human hela cells and measured the effect of loss-of-function of these factors on exon usage . we tested  <dig> exons of the above  <dig> and  <dig> additional genes. we were able to successfully detect expression and alternative splicing of  <dig> exons in this cell line . all of them showed an increased exon inclusion  or a reduced exon skipping  upon hnrnp h/f knockdown . thus, the g-tract-binding factors hnrnp h/f are essential repressors of all of the six exons of endogenous genes tested, consistent with the silencing effect of the g tracts in splicing reporters .figure  <dig>

the repa g tracts emerged mostly in the ancestors of mammals during evolution
to determine the evolutionary origin of the g tracts, we analyzed  <dig> 3′ss in multiple species ranging from fish to humans. we were able to determine the presence or absence of  <dig> of them in every class of animals analyzed . g tracts of  <dig> of these 3′ss  were also found early as in marsupials, four of them  in other mammals and only two of them in birds, reptiles and fish. therefore, it is likely that most of the g tracts  emerged in ancestors of mammals.

as an example, the mammal-specific emergence of the g pentamer in camk <dig> is shown in figure  <dig>  besides the full length camk <dig>  there is a shorter transcript  with the retention of introns  <dig> and  <dig> within the 3′ untranslated region . the g pentamer ggggg is at the upstream 3′ss of exon  <dig>  where it might weaken the 3′ss to promote intron retention.table  <dig> 
the repa g tracts among vertebrates


nd: not determined.
an example of evolutionary emergence of repa g tracts between the polypyrimidine tract and 3′ag within the upstream 3′ss of alternative exons of mammalian genes. shown is an alignment of sequences around the 3′ss of the camk <dig> gene from  <dig> species. the g tract  is at the 3′ss of intron  <dig> . retention of both upstream and downstream introns around exon  <dig> generates a splice variant with an alternative stop codon in the upstream intron . in most other transcripts, both introns are spliced. arrowhead: intron/exon boundary. it can be seen from the alignment that the g pentamer is present in most mammals. it is absent in wallaby, platypus, birds and the other vertebrates shown here.



alignment of the camk <dig> 3′ss from  <dig> species indicates that the g pentamer  is present in mammals from human to opossum but not in wallaby and platypus, nor is it present in chicken, lizard, frog or fish. interestingly, there are three gs in wallaby and two gs in platypus, both interrupted by a single t. it thus seems that the g tracts emerged in mammalian ancestors but were lost in some marsupials.

the mostly mammalian emergence of the repa g tracts is consistent with the conclusion that g triplets are more abundant in mammalian than in fish introns as previously reported in a genome-wide study  <cit> .

taken together, the examined repa g tracts are mostly mammalian gene-specific, suggesting that they may have evolved to inhibit the splicing of a group of mammalian exons.

the repa g tract-host genes are significantly associated with cancer
to determine whether these g tract-harboring 3′ss are associated with any specific biological functions or diseases, we analyzed  <dig> mapped genes of the  <dig> 3′ss in the dataset in the ingenuity pathway analyses. in this search, we also included  <dig> sets of randomly chosen human genes from the ensembl genome database to control the specificity of the analysis. the result indicates that the  <dig> genes are markedly enriched for genes involved in cancer , by about  <dig> fold -log over the  <dig> sets of randomly chosen genes. particularly melanoma, carcinoma and solid tumors have the most significant enrichment of these genes, including abcc <dig> , snrnp <dig> , trerf <dig>  and wtx  . snrnp <dig> together with another seven genes encode splicing factors: hnrnph <dig>  hnrnph <dig>  khsrp, mbnl <dig>  ppan, prpf <dig>  snrpn. particularly interesting is the hnrnp h <dig> and h <dig>  which are g tract-binding proteins themselves, predicting an auto-regulatory circuit through alternative splicing. moreover, most of the genes in figures  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  are involved in cancer as well . furthermore, similar ingenuity pathway analysis using the full set of the g3– <dig> 3′ss-containing genes reached the same conclusion. therefore, the repa g tracts are significantly enriched in genes involved in cancer, likely to control their alternative splicing and cancer properties.figure  <dig>

as an example of the genes involved in cancer, the wtx  has a retained intron with a 3′ss g <dig> in its second exon  <cit>  . the full length transcript encodes an 1135aa protein that interacts with the transcription factor wt <dig>  and efficiently enhances its transcriptional activity  <cit> . the intron splicing results in a shorter protein of 804aa lacking the wt1-interacting domain. the shorter isoform has reduced effect on wt <dig> transcriptional activity  <cit> . therefore, the 3′ repa g tract-associated intron retention/splicing determine the high or low activity of the tumor suppressor wtx. presence of the g tract appears to favor the full activity of the protein, likely by weakening the 3′ splice site and thus promoting intron retention.

also enriched are biological functions associated with organismal survival ), and to some extent cellular growth & proliferation .

taken together, more than six hundred 3′ss that harbour repa g tracts associated with alternative splicing are identified in the human genome. instead of being enhancers as the other mammalian intronic g tracts, these specially localized g tracts appear to be intronic splicing silencers and mostly emerged in the ancestors of mammals. moreover, their host genes are highly associated with cancer. these data suggest that mammals have evolved de novo rna elements within this highly constrained space of 3′ splice site to alter the mrna processing step for diverse proteins in particular cellular functions.

discussion
regulatory rna elements between py and 3′ag 
the splicing regulatory elements can be outside or overlap with the splice site motifs. however, since the location and sequences of the polypyrimidine tract and 3′ ag have been more or less constrained for many splice sites, emergence of de novo regulatory elements between them has not been observed frequently. a g-rich sequence was identified in a group of drosophila genes but it was enriched further upstream  in the intron to inhibit splicing  <cit> . while the previously reported carre <dig> of the strex exon support the existence of repa elements  <cit> , here the identification of a large group of 3′ss g tracts clearly demonstrate that the emergence of de novo regulatory elements do occur at this location, apparently for the regulation of alternative splicing mainly in mammals. moreover, these elements are location-dependent silencers of the immediate downstream 3′ag , instead of enhancers as found for the other mammalian intronic g tracts outside of the region between py and 3′ag  <cit> . beyond g tracts, there are also other purine-rich elements identified in this search that await further detailed analysis to reveal their function in splicing regulation. furthermore, this also implies the existence of other non-purine-rich elements. in fact, we have also observed ugcaug elements at this location of alternative exons . therefore, the repertoires of repa will apparently increase in the future. overall, the repa provides a distinct example for the variations of splice sites to cause alternative usage of exons  <cit> .

variations of splice sites for alternative splicing and proteomic diversity during evolution
splicing regulatory rna elements have evolved from fish to humans with dramatic emergence of some additional elements including g tracts  <cit> . here the repa g tracts appear to have evolved mostly in mammalian ancestors, evident from the alignment of 3′ss of multiple species . the evolved elements likely increase the possibility for alternative splicing and cause functional changes of the proteins . moreover, their recruitment of trans-acting factors, such as hnrnp h/f , would make it possible for upstream signaling to reach the target splice site  <cit> , adding a further layer to the splicing regulation. with the help of more repas in the genome , more diverse protein isoforms and functions of mammalian genes could be generated.

role of g tracts and alternative splicing in cancer
accumulating evidence indicate that alternative splicing has been exploited by cancer cells to favor their survival  <cit> . g tracts have been found to control the alternative splicing of genes involved in cancer, such as bcl-x  <cit> . their trans-acting factors have also been found to regulate alternative splicing during tumorigenesis. for instance, upregulation of hnrnp h in gliomas drives the ig <dig> to anti-apoptotic madd  splicing in favor of invasiveness  <cit> . in hela cells, hnrnp h/f upregulates the pro-apoptosis variant bcl-xs  <cit> . multiple g-tracts can also form a stable four strand structure called a g quadruple that is less represented in exon sequences  <cit> . they are formed in a cell-cycle-dependent way with the highest abundance in the s phase  <cit> , and have been proposed as therapeutic targets for diseases including cancer, for example, by controlling oncogene transcription  <cit> . they are also proposed to control alternative splicing of the tumor suppressor p <dig>  <cit> , and the telomere rna htert  <cit> . multiple copies of g tracts are also seen in some of the 3′ss examined here. for example the 3′ss of exon  <dig> of the matrix-remodeling associated  <dig>  gene has five copies of g2– <dig> within 50 nt of the intron end. whether g quadruples may form and play a role in the control of alternative splicing of some of these cancer-related genes will need future studies.

in summary, the identification of hundreds of human 3′ss containing the repa g tracts and the confirmed splicing silencer effect of representative ones suggest that the highly constrained 3′ss region has been permissive for the emergence of de novo regulatory elements for splicing control of a large group of mammalian genes. their significant enrichment in genes involved in cancer implies that their regulation of splicing perhaps control certain properties of cancer cells.

CONCLUSIONS
a large group of human 3′ss have evolved purine-rich elements between the py and 3′ag. particularly the g tract elements are splicing silencers requiring hnrnp h/f for their activity. such g tract-harboring human genes are significantly enriched for functions related to cancer. these data demonstrate that the often highly constrained space between the py and 3′ag has been remarkably permissive for the evolution of splicing regulatory elements, likely to diversify protein functions in mammals. the presence of such elements at the 3′ss is also predictive of alternative splice sites.
