BACKGROUND
during organogenesis, cell proliferation, differentiation, and morphogenesis have to be tightly coordinated. this process involves extensive changes in gene expression, which entails epigenetic mechanisms such as dna methylation, nucleosome remodeling, and post-translational modifications of the histones  <cit> . epigenetic modifications mark the genome as regions that are either accessible or closed for the transcription machinery. since these modifications can be inherited through cell divisions, epigenetic control is thought to maintain identity and behavior of a given cell type. accordingly, fate switches associated, for instance, with the transition from a proliferative multipotent progenitor cell to a non-dividing terminally differentiated cell type, are accompanied and potentially controlled by changes in epigenetic information.

key players in this process are polycomb group  proteins that form two complexes, polycomb repressive complex   <dig> and prc <dig>  which repress gene activity by catalyzing trimethylation of lysine  <dig> on histone h <dig>   <cit> . the catalytic subunit of prc <dig> is the methyltransferase enhancer of zeste homolog  <dig>  or its homolog ezh <dig>  <cit> . ezh <dig> is essential for vertebrate development since mice lacking ezh <dig> die around gastrulation  <cit> . a role of pcg proteins in the developing nervous system was suggested by experiments in embryonic stem cells undergoing neural differentiation, in which genes active during neurogenesis were shown to be dynamically marked by h3k27me <dig> and interference with demethylation of h3k27me <dig> prevented proper acquisition of a neural fate  <cit> . conditional knock out  of ezh <dig> in the developing murine forebrain around embryonic day   <dig>  i.e. before onset of neurogenesis, shifted the balance between self-renewal and differentiation of neural progenitors cells  towards neuronal differentiation  <cit> . similarly, the prc <dig> component, bmi <dig>  was shown to control proliferation and self-renewal of npcs during embryonic development by repressing the cell cycle inhibitor p <dig>  <cit> . however, at a later stage of cortical development, pcg proteins were reported to regulate the timely transition from neurogenesis to astrogenesis by repressing, among others, the proneural transcription factor neurog <dig>  <cit> . these data reveal additional roles of ezh <dig> during central nervous system development, apart from regulating stem cell properties. in support of this notion, downregulation of ezh <dig> in npc cultures derived from the forebrain at e <dig> promoted astrogenesis at the expense of oligodendrocyte development  <cit> . in contrast, conditional deletion of ezh <dig> in the neural crest did not affect stem cell proliferation and self-renewal nor timely neurogenesis and gliogenesis in the peripheral nervous system  <cit> . together, these findings demonstrate that pcg proteins function in a cell type- and stage-dependent manner during neural development, presumably by repression of distinct sets of target genes.

to further address this issue, we conditionally deleted ezh <dig> in the developing murine midbrain. loss of ezh <dig> resulted in drastically reduced growth of midbrain npcs, which we found to involve derepression of specific cell cycle inhibitors as well as reduced canonical wnt signaling. moreover, ezh <dig> ablation in the midbrain led to derepression of a forebrain transcriptional program associated with reduced expression of midbrain markers. thus, our study not only provides mechanistic insights on how npc pool size is regulated in the midbrain, but also reveals a novel function of ezh <dig> in consolidating regional identities in the developing brain.

RESULTS
conditional inactivation of ezh <dig> in the developing midbrain affects progenitor cell expansion
to address the role of ezh2-mediated h3k27me <dig> in the developing midbrain, we conditionally deleted ezh <dig> in mice homozygous for the floxed allele of ezh <dig> using the wnt1-cre allele   <cit> . wnt1-cre+/ezh2lox/lox conditional knock-out  mice survive to late developmental stages, but die around e <dig>  displaying craniofacial abnormalities and heart malformations caused by concomitant activity of wnt1-cre in the neural crest  <cit> . in the midbrain, ablation of ezh <dig> was evident from e <dig>  onwards . of note, ezh <dig> expression was very low in the embryonic midbrain and, importantly, was not affected upon conditional ezh <dig> inactivation . ezh <dig> loss was associated with widespread loss of h3k27me <dig>  as shown by immunohistochemistry at e <dig>  . using the rosa <dig> cre reporter allele driving β-galactosidase expression, we could also show full wnt1-cre-mediated recombination in the caudal midbrain  <cit> . histological analyses revealed a marked reduction of the neuroepithelial thickness in the midbrain of ezh <dig> cko embryos at e <dig>  as compared to normal embryos, which was even more pronounced at e <dig>  . furthermore, horizontal expansion of the neuroepithelium was decreased in mutant midbrains, as was most apparent in the isthmal and inferior tectal region at e <dig>  .fig.  <dig> wnt1-cre-mediated ezh2/h3k27me <dig> ablation affects midbrain expansion.  left panel: scheme of the recombination area of the wnt1-cre line  in the murine midbrain at e <dig> . wnt1-cre

these data are consistent with altered cell cycling of mutant neuroepithelial progenitor cells  <cit> . indeed, the number of proliferative cells incorporating the thymidine analogue edu during a 1-hour edu pulse was significantly reduced in the developing midbrain of ezh <dig> cko embryos at e <dig>  as compared to control littermates . the decrease of proliferative cells in the mutant midbrain could be associated with mutant neuroepithelial cells preferentially choosing to exit rather than to remain in the cell cycle. to address this possibility, we determined the fraction of ki67-positive dividing cells after a brdu pulse of 24 hours. cells that had left the cell cycle were brdu-positive but ki67-negative, while cells that were still in the cell cycle at the time point of analysis were both brdu- and ki67-positive. at e <dig> , a highly significant increase of cells exiting the cell cycle was detectable in the mutant as compared to the control . immunohistochemistry for the npc marker sox <dig> and the differentiation marker dcx further demonstrated that decreased proliferation in the midbrain of ezh <dig> cko embryos at e <dig>  was accompanied by a reduction in the number of progenitor cells and a concomitant increase in differentiation . the increased neurogenesis in the ezh <dig> cko midbrain was also confirmed at e <dig>  . cell survival was impaired in the dorsal rostral midbrain of mutant embryos but unchanged in the area used for quantification of mitotic cells . thus, ezh <dig> is essential for proper midbrain formation by controlling the pool size of npcs.fig.  <dig> ezh2-deficient neural progenitor cells  show reduced proliferation and precocious cell cycle exit.  confocal images of the inferior tectal midbrain at e <dig>  with respective quantification. cartoon insert indicates area of analysis for a–c.  immunostaining against the thymidine analogue edu after 1-h pulse labeling reveals reduced proliferation of npcs in ezh2-deficient cells. n ≥ <dig> in each group, ***p ≤ <dig> , student’s t-test.  after a 24-h brdu pulse, staining against brdu and the proliferation marker ki <dig> distinguishes cells that have exited the cell cycle as brdu-positive and ki67-negative. quantification of brdu + ki67−/brdu+ cells demonstrates increased cell cycle exit of mutant npcs. n ≥ <dig> in each group, ***p ≤ <dig> , student’s t-test.  ezh2-deficient npcs differentiate precociously as the quantification of sox2-positive npcs and dcx-positive neurons show. n ≥ <dig> in each group, *p ≤ <dig> , student’s t-test.  immunostaining for cleaved caspase <dig> on sagittal midbrain sections reveals increased apoptosis in the dorsal midbrain of the mutant as compared to the control. in contrast, higher magnification confocal micrographs of the inferior tectal midbrain  display no apoptosis. dapi staining serves as nuclear marker for all images. scale bars: a–c, 40 μm, d, 200 μm , 40 μm ; error bars indicate sd; ctrl, control



ezh <dig> controls proliferation of neural progenitor cells by repressing cell cycle regulators and inhibitors of wnt signaling
to identify the molecular mechanisms mediating ezh2-dependent midbrain development, we used microarray analysis to compare the global gene expression patterns of control versus ezh <dig> cko cells isolated from the dorsal midbrain of e <dig>  embryos. cluster analysis of the transcriptome data indicated that the vast majority of differentially expressed genes were transcriptionally upregulated upon loss of ezh <dig> . this is consistent with the role of ezh <dig> as a transcriptional repressor  <cit> . gene ontology analysis of process networks revealed that differentially expressed genes were involved, among others, in negative regulation of proliferation, wnt signaling, and cell cycle regulation . since misregulation of those processes very likely contributes to the described mutant phenotype, we focused our analysis on the aforementioned process networks. among the genes derepressed in ezh <dig> cko cells, were the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors  2a and 2c, which negatively regulate cellular proliferation . increased expression of cdkn2a and cdkn2c was also demonstrated by quantitative rt-pcr performed on midbrain cells isolated from e <dig>  embryos . moreover, in situ hybridization on sagittal sections of e <dig>  control and mutant midbrains revealed the specific increase in expression of the cell cycle inhibitor cdkn2a in ezh <dig> cko embryos . finally, we performed an h3k27me <dig> chip assay on wildtype e <dig>  midbrain cells and revealed that the promoters of cdkn2a and cdkn2c were occupied by h3k27me <dig>  thus, these cell cycle inhibitors appear to be direct targets of ezh2-mediated epigenetic repression .fig.  <dig> neural progenitor cell proliferation is controlled by ezh2-mediated repression of cell cycle and wnt/β-catenin signaling inhibitors.  microarray analysis of three dissected e <dig>  control and mutant midbrains identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes , the majority of which  are upregulated upon ezh <dig> ablation. genes further analyzed are indicated.  qrt-pcr for ezh <dig>  cell cycle regulators cdkn2a and cdkn2c, and wnt signaling inhibitors wif <dig> and dkk <dig> on control and mutant e <dig>  midbrains confirms microarray data. n ≥ <dig> in each group, ***p ≤ <dig> , **p ≤ <dig> , *p ≤ <dig> , student’s t-test.  chromatin immunoprecipitation confirms the presence of h3k27me <dig> at the transcription start site  of cdkn2a, cdkn2c, wif <dig>  and dkk <dig>  intergenic region int <dig> serves as unmethylated negative control. n ≥ <dig> in each group, ***p ≤ <dig> , **p ≤ <dig> , student’s t-test.  in situ hybridization for cdkn2a  and wif <dig>  mrna illustrates increased gene expression in ezh <dig> mutants.  immunostaining for β-galactosidase + cells on the bat-gal wnt/β-catenin signaling reporter line demonstrates diminished signaling in ezh2-deficient midbrains. n ≥ <dig> in each group, **p ≤ <dig> , student’s t-test. cartoon insert indicates area of analysis for f and g.  immunostaining against cyclind <dig> and qrt-pcr.  ccnd <dig> and lef <dig> wnt signaling downstream targets show decreased expression upon ezh <dig> ablation. n ≥ <dig> in each group, ***p ≤ <dig> , **p ≤ <dig> , student’s t-test.  h&e staining of e <dig>  sagittal midbrain sections of controls and wnt/β-catenin signaling-ablated embryos. mutant embryos exhibit reduced neuroepithelium thickness indicated with grey brackets in the magnifications. dapi staining serves as nuclear marker: f, g; scale bars: d, e, 100 μm; f, g, 40 μm; i, 400 μm; error bars indicate sd; ctrl, control; dmb, dorsal midbrain; vmb, ventral midbrain



in addition, we also found other potentially relevant genes to be differentially expressed upon loss of ezh <dig>  in particular, inhibitors of the wnt signaling pathway, such as wif <dig> and dkk <dig>  <cit> , were also significantly upregulated in ezh <dig> cko cells . h3k27me <dig> chip analysis confirmed that these wnt signaling inhibitors appear also to be direct targets of ezh <dig> activity . canonical wnt signaling has been demonstrated to control maintenance of midbrain neuroepithelial cells  <cit> . therefore, we investigated whether wnt signal activity is indeed affected by loss of ezh <dig>  to this end, we made use of the bat-gal wnt signaling reporter allele, which monitors β-catenin activity by driving β-galactosidase expression in wnt signaling-active cells  <cit> . in mice harboring this reporter allele, we observed a prominent reduction in the number of β-galactosidase-positive neural cells in the ezh <dig> cko midbrain at e <dig> , as compared to the control . accordingly, targets of wnt signaling, such as cyclind <dig> and lef <dig>  were downregulated in the mutant midbrain, as shown by immunohistochemistry and quantitative rt-pcr, respectively .

our data indicate that reduced canonical wnt signaling might also contribute to the phenotype of ezh <dig> cko mice. to better understand the role of canonical wnt signaling in regulating midbrain size, we took advantage of a mutant allele of the wnt signaling component β-catenin  that disrupts wnt/β-catenin-mediated transcriptional output but not cell-cell adhesion  <cit> . while total loss of β-catenin leads to disintegration of the midbrain  <cit> , loss of β-catenin signaling function did not affect the integrity of the neuroepithelium. however, very similar to ezh <dig> cko embryos , the thickness and overall size of the midbrain was drastically reduced in wnt1-cre/ctnnb <dig> sign mt cko mice at e <dig>  . therefore, ezh <dig> appears to regulate the size of the developing midbrain both by direct repression of cell cycle inhibitors and, indirectly, by sustaining β-catenin signaling.

ezh <dig> represses forebrain identity in the developing midbrain
intriguingly, the microarray analysis of control and ezh <dig> cko midbrain pointed to an additional set of ezh2-regulated genes that are known to exhibit brain area-specific, rather than general cellular functions in the developing neuroepithelium. notably, several forebrain specification genes were derepressed in ezh <dig> cko midbrains . in situ hybridization experiments, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative rt-pcr experiments were used to corroborate this finding. while normally foxg <dig> is strongly expressed in the forebrain but absent in the midbrain, it was upregulated in the midbrain of ezh <dig> cko embryos at e <dig>  . a quantitative analysis at e <dig>  revealed a more than 75-fold induction of foxg <dig> expression in the mutant midbrain . likewise, the midbrain is normally devoid of pax <dig> expression, whereas upon loss of ezh <dig>  pax <dig> became broadly expressed in the midbrain, displaying a 22-fold induction at e <dig>  . furthermore, the forebrain markers dlx <dig> and emx <dig> were ectopically expressed in the midbrain of ezh <dig> cko embryos at e <dig>  . however, when comparing mrna levels of ezh <dig>  pax <dig>  foxg <dig> and emx <dig> in wildtype forebrain, wildtype midbrain, and ezh <dig> cko midbrain of e <dig>  embryos it became apparent that expression levels of ectopic forebrain markers in the mutant midbrain did not reach those of the forebrain .fig.  <dig> establishment of forebrain identity in ezh2-ablated midbrain cells.  upper panel: antibody staining for forebrain-specific transcription factor foxg <dig> on sagittal brain sections at e <dig>  demonstrates forebrain-restricted foxg <dig> expression in the control and ectopic foxg <dig> expression in the dorsal mutant midbrain. the cartoon indicates regular foxg <dig> expression. lower panel: high-magnification confocal images of immunostaining for ezh <dig> and foxg <dig> show ectopic foxg <dig> expression in ezh2-ablated cells .  upper panel: antibody staining for pax <dig> reveals ectopic pax <dig> expression in the ezh <dig> mutant midbrain. the cartoon inset illustrates regular pax <dig> distribution at e <dig>  rostral of the di-mesencephalic boundary indicated by a white dotted line. lower panel: immunostaining for ezh <dig> and pax <dig> reveals ectopic mosaic-like upregulation of pax <dig> in cre-recombined cells without ezh <dig> .  chip confirms the presence of h3k27me <dig> repressive mark at the transcription start site of pax <dig> and foxg <dig> . the intergenic region int <dig> is unmethylated and serves as negative control. n ≥ <dig> in each group, ***p ≤ <dig> , student’s t-test.  in situ hybridization for dlx <dig> mrna and qrt-pcr for foxg <dig>  pax <dig>  dlx <dig>  and emx <dig> demonstrate elevated expression of the forebrain transcription factors in ezh2-deficient midbrains. n ≥ <dig> in each group, ***p ≤ <dig> , **p ≤ <dig> , *p ≤ <dig> , student’s t-test. ectopic dlx <dig> expression is indicated by a black arrow . downstream targets of pax <dig> – dmrta <dig> and neurog <dig> – are induced in mutant midbrains as shown by in situ hybridization for neurog <dig> mrna  and qrt-pcr for dmrta <dig> and neurog <dig> . n ≥ <dig> in each group, ***p ≤ <dig> , **p ≤ <dig> , student’s t-test. dapi staining serves as nuclear marker: a, b; scale bars: a, b, 500 μm ; a, b, 40 μm ; d, f, 100 μm; error bars indicate sd; ctrl, control; fb, forebrain; mb, midbrain; dmb, dorsal midbrain; vmb, ventral midbrain



in most rostral regions of the dorsal midbrain, ezh2-dependent h3k27me <dig> was only partially depleted in ezh <dig> cko embryos . incomplete wnt1-cre-mediated recombination was shown by tracking of recombined cells using the aforementioned rosa <dig> cre reporter allele   <cit> . therefore, non-recombined cells were intermingled with clusters of ezh2-deficient cells in the rostral midbrain of ezh <dig> cko embryos at e <dig>  . strikingly, in this area, ezh <dig> exhibited a perfectly inverse relationship with foxg <dig> and pax <dig> expression patterns, respectively, pointing to cell-autonomous mechanisms underlying the gain of forebrain markers in ezh <dig> cko midbrain cells . in support of this, h3k27me <dig> chip experiments performed with midbrain cells from control embryos at e <dig>  demonstrated that the forebrain specification genes foxg <dig> and pax <dig> appear to be direct targets of ezh2-mediated repression .

in the developing forebrain, pax <dig> acts upstream of the transcription factor dmrta <dig>  which itself regulates the expression of the proneural gene neurog <dig>  <cit> . strikingly, pax <dig> upregulation in the ezh <dig> cko midbrain was associated with significant upregulation of both dmrta <dig> and neurog <dig> . thus, although forebrain neuronal layer-specific markers could not be analyzed at later stages due to the substantial mass reduction and disturbed morphology of the mutant midbrain , our data reveal the ectopic upregulation of a forebrain transcriptional program in the midbrain of ezh <dig> cko embryos.

ezh <dig> regulates midbrain identity by indirect mechanisms
comparable to pax <dig>  foxg <dig>  dlx <dig>  and emx <dig> in the developing forebrain, the transcription factors pax <dig> and pax <dig> have been shown to establish midbrain identity during vertebrate brain development  <cit> . to address whether expression of these midbrain specification factors was also affected by loss of ezh <dig>  we performed quantitative rt-pcr and immunohistochemistry. while expression of pax <dig> and pax <dig> was unchanged at e <dig>  as shown by qpcr, it was significantly downregulated at e <dig>  . consistent with these results, immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of pax <dig> at e <dig>   and the highly reduced expression of both transcription factors at e <dig>  in ezh <dig> cko. indeed, whereas pax <dig> and pax <dig> were detected in the entire dorsal midbrain neuroepithelium in control embryos, many cells in the mutant dorsal midbrain were devoid of pax <dig> and pax <dig> or showed reduced staining intensity . thus, ezh2-mediated h3k27me <dig> is required for proper expression of midbrain specification genes.fig.  <dig> ezh <dig> regulates midbrain identity indirectly.  qrt-pcr for ezh <dig>  pax <dig>  and pax <dig> on midbrain tissue isolated at e <dig>  and e <dig>  reveals a downregulation of midbrain transcription factors pax <dig> and pax <dig> in the absence of ezh <dig> after e <dig> . n ≥ <dig> in each group, ***p ≤ <dig> , student’s t-test.  immunostaining for pax <dig>  and pax <dig>  on sagittal midbrain sections shows diminished protein levels at e <dig>  . the cartoon insets indicate regular pax <dig> and pax <dig> expression at e <dig> , respectively. dapi staining serves as nuclear marker: b, c; scale bars: b, c, 500 μm ; b, c, 40 μm ; error bars indicate sd; mb, midbrain



our study identified the forebrain specification genes foxg <dig> and pax <dig> as targets of ezh <dig> activity, which is in agreement with their increased expression in the ezh <dig> cko midbrain . in contrast, the loss of midbrain identity markers in ezh <dig> cko embryos cannot be explained by direct ezh2-mediated repression. in chicken embryos, overexpression of pax <dig> has been reported to indirectly repress pax <dig> and pax <dig> expression in the trigeminal placode and at the forebrain-midbrain boundary, respectively  <cit> . however, while we found pax <dig> to be strongly upregulated in the ezh <dig> cko midbrain already at e <dig>  , pax <dig> and pax <dig> were downregulated at e <dig>  only , rather arguing against control of the midbrain specification factors by pax <dig>  to directly address this hypothesis, we performed in utero electroporation of a pax6-overexpression vector together with a gfp expression vector. in parallel we electroporated the gfp expressing vector alone as a control. monitoring gfp expression two days after in utero electroporation revealed the efficient targeting of the murine dorsal midbrain by this method . coronal sections of electroporated midbrains were then used to quantify the number of pax3- and pax7-expressing cells per gfp-positive cells by immunofluorescence. for each condition, the midbrains of three embryos were electroporated and more than  <dig> cells were analyzed . however, as shown in fig. 6a and additional file 1: figure s7c, ectopic expression of pax <dig> did not influence pax <dig> and pax <dig> expression in dorsal midbrain cells. hence, increased pax <dig> expression is apparently unable to repress pax <dig> and pax <dig> in the established murine midbrain and is, therefore, unlikely the cause for downregulated expression of midbrain fate determinants in ezh <dig> cko embryos.fig.  <dig> midbrain markers are not directly repressed by pax <dig> but are regulated indirectly by wnt/β-catenin signaling.  a pax <dig> overexpression construct together with a gfp-expressing vector  or a gfp-expressing vector alone  were delivered by in utero electroporation into the dorsal midbrain at e <dig> . two days later the proportion of gfp+ cells expressing midbrain markers pax <dig> and pax <dig> was analyzed. overexpression of pax <dig> does not affect the proportion of midbrain marker-expressing cells. n =  <dig> in each group, two different litters .  immunostaining for pax <dig>  and pax <dig>  at e <dig>  reveals decreased protein levels in midbrains with ablated wnt/β-catenin signaling  compared to control. cartoon insets show regular expression pattern, asterisk indicates basal. dapi staining serves as nuclear marker: b, c; scale bars: b, c, 500 μm ; b, c, 40 μm ; error bars indicate sd; iue, in utero electroporation; ctrl, control; ctnnb <dig> sign mt, wnt/β-catenin signaling mutant; mb, midbrain



previously, wnt/β-catenin signaling was shown to activate pax <dig> and pax <dig> expression in the lateral neural plate and during neural tube closure . therefore, reduced pax3/pax <dig> expression in the ezh <dig> cko midbrain might be due to decreased canonical wnt signaling in mutant brain tissue . to investigate whether wnt/β-catenin is required for expression of pax <dig> and pax <dig> in the dorsal midbrain, we performed immunohistochemistry on sagittal sections of wnt1-cre/ctnnb <dig> sign mt cko embryos at e <dig> . loss of β-catenin signaling not only affected midbrain size, but also resulted in drastically reduced expression of both pax <dig> and pax <dig> . in fact, the midbrains of wnt1-cre/ctnnb <dig> sign mt cko embryos displayed a phenotype very comparable to the one of ezh <dig> cko embryos , with many mutant cells lacking pax <dig> and pax <dig> expression. thus, the loss of midbrain identity markers in the ezh <dig> cko midbrain is apparently caused by indirect mechanisms, involving ezh2-mediated control of canonical wnt signaling.

discussion
epigenetic information can be passed from a dividing cell to its daughter cells, which is thought to support inheritance of specific gene expression patterns. in this way, epigenetic mechanisms supposedly consolidate cellular identities as, for instance, upon differentiation of a multipotent cell into a specific cell type  <cit> . in our study, we show that this mechanism is also involved in sustaining regional identity in the developing brain: ezh2-mediated gene repression prevents midbrain cells from acquiring forebrain traits. accordingly, conditional loss of ezh <dig> in midbrain npcs not only affected their proliferation, but also resulted in derepression of a forebrain transcriptional program. we demonstrate that both the control of cell cycle progression and maintenance of regional identity involve direct h3k27me3-dependent gene repression as well as indirect mechanisms mediated, in particular, by modulation of canonical wnt signaling .fig.  <dig> proposed model for the role of ezh <dig> in mouse midbrain development. ezh <dig> controls neural progenitor proliferation and brain area identity via direct and indirect mechanisms. ezh <dig> regulates cell cycle progression by h3k27me3-mediated repression of negative cell cycle regulators cdkna <dig> and cdkn2c and wnt/β-catenin signaling inhibitors wif <dig> and dkk <dig>  also, ezh <dig> maintains midbrain identity of cells by suppressing forebrain determinants foxg <dig> and pax <dig> and by maintaining wnt/β-catenin signaling, which is essential for the expression of midbrain markers pax <dig> and pax <dig>  therefore, loss of ezh <dig> in the developing mouse midbrain leads to decreased proliferation and precocious cell cycle exit of neural progenitors in addition to a partial loss of midbrain identity and ectopic establishment of forebrain identity



in many systems, ezh2-dependent transcriptional control often guards the stem/progenitor state by repressing cell cycle exit and differentiation. this has also been shown for the developing forebrain, where ezh <dig> regulates the transition from npc proliferation to differentiation at a stage before overt neurogenesis  <cit> . in this previous study, loss of ezh <dig> was associated with upregulation of several genes specifically expressed in differentiating cortical neurons. in contrast, expression of negative cell cycle regulators was normal or only slightly altered in the ezh <dig> cko forebrain  <cit> . our work reveals that, similar to its role in the forebrain, ezh <dig> is required for proper growth of the midbrain. conditional ezh <dig> deletion resulted in drastically reduced numbers of proliferative midbrain npcs, associated with elevated cell cycle exit and differentiation. consistent with this phenotype, but different from the ezh <dig> cko forebrain  <cit> , the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors cdkn2a  and cdkn2c  were directly regulated by ezh2-mediated h3k27me <dig> in midbrain cells . in addition, wnt signaling inhibitors turned out to also be ezh <dig> targets in the developing midbrain. consequently, wnt/β-catenin signal activity was significantly reduced upon loss of ezh <dig>  in the midbrain, wnt <dig> is thought to maintain cells in a proliferative state  <cit> . accordingly, wnt <dig> overexpression led to massive expansion of midbrain tissue  <cit> . in agreement with this earlier work, inactivation of the transcriptional output of wnt signaling by means of a mutant β-catenin allele  <cit>  impeded midbrain growth. although the phenotype was more drastic when wnt/β-catenin signaling was completely inactivated as opposed to only reduced in ezh <dig> cko embryos, our findings demonstrate how the regulation of a crucial signaling pathway by epigenetic repression contributes to the proper control of brain size .

surprisingly, apart from negative cell cycle regulators and wnt signaling inhibitors, the forebrain determinants pax <dig> and foxg <dig> were also among the genes upregulated in the ezh2-deficient midbrain neuroepithelium. moreover, the promoters of both of these genes were marked by h3k27me <dig> in the midbrain. in embryonic stem cells, the pax <dig> promoter is enriched for h3k27me <dig>  which is removed when the cells acquire a forebrain neural fate  <cit> . furthermore, pax <dig> is one of the ezh2-repressed genes in the murine heart  <cit> . however, pax <dig> has not been identified before as an ezh <dig> target in the context of the murine brain in vivo. we now show that pax <dig> is derepressed in ezh2-deficient midbrain cells from e <dig>  to e <dig> . during this timeframe, midbrain npcs progress through the cell cycle at least twice  <cit> , indicating that gene derepression mediated by ezh <dig> loss is maintained through cell division. more importantly, we found pax <dig> derepression in the ezh2-deficient midbrain to be accompanied by activation of a forebrain transcriptional program that included pax <dig>  foxg <dig>  dlx <dig>  emx <dig>  and the transcription factors dmrta <dig> and neurog <dig>  which themselves are downstream targets of pax <dig>  <cit> . thus, ezh <dig> represses a forebrain fate in the midbrain . presumably, additional factors would be required in an epigenetically derepressed midbrain to implement later forebrain features, such as characteristic layer formation and differentiation into specific neuronal subtypes. however, this cannot be achieved the ezh <dig> cko midbrain, because of the aforementioned other major role of ezh <dig> in regulating midbrain growth.

along with the gain of forebrain identity in ezh2-deficient midbrain tissue, we observed a substantial reduction in the expression of dorsal midbrain markers pax <dig> and pax <dig>  which are key regulators of midbrain development  <cit> . unlike the changes in forebrain markers, reduced pax <dig> and pax <dig> expression was delayed upon loss of ezh <dig> protein. likewise, early expression of the midbrain patterning markers, otx <dig>  fgf <dig>  pax <dig>  and en <dig> , was not affected in the midbrain lacking ezh <dig> . together with the initially normal expression of pax <dig> and pax <dig> in the ezh <dig> cko midbrain, our findings indicate that ezh <dig> is not involved in the early establishment of midbrain identity, but rather in its maintenance.

the delayed timing of midbrain marker loss and the canonical function of ezh <dig> as a transcriptional repressor suggested that pax <dig> and pax <dig> expression is indirectly controlled by ezh <dig>  apparently, this did not involve pax6-dependent downregulation of pax3/ <dig> as demonstrated by in utero electroporation of pax <dig> in the specified dorsal midbrain. in chicken, pax <dig> overexpression has been shown before to repress pax <dig> and pax <dig> expression in neural tissue  <cit> . since in these studies, pax6-dependent regulation of pax3/ <dig> was indirect and mediated by a hitherto unidentified repressor, we propose that this repressing function might either be absent in the mammalian midbrain or at a stage when the pax3/pax <dig> expression domains have already been established. however, our work reveals an alternative mechanism for how midbrain-specific markers are being lost upon ezh <dig> inactivation – indeed, reduced canonical wnt signaling not only interfered with midbrain growth, but also with the continuous expression of pax <dig> and pax <dig> . this finding was corroborated by the analysis of mutant midbrains, in which wnt/β-catenin signaling was conditionally depleted.

CONCLUSIONS
the change of brain area identities caused by loss of ezh <dig> involves h3k27me3-mediated derepression of forebrain-specific transcription factors and indirect reduction of canonical wnt signaling due to derepression of wnt signal inhibitors. thus, our study identifies epigenetic repression of multiple transcription factors and a central signaling pathway as a key mechanism in sustaining brain growth and regional identity.
