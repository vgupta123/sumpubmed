BACKGROUND
fatty acids  are crucial for all living organisms because they are not only a source of energy but are also major components of cellular membranes. recently, an increasing number of studies has suggested that fas and their derivatives have important roles as signaling molecules that modulate normal and disease-related processes  <cit> . in plants, fas influence a variety of processes in response to both biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . for example, the levels of polyunsaturated fas in chloroplast membranes affect membrane lipid fluidity, which may affect plant tolerance to temperature stress  <cit> . in addition, linolenic acid is involved in protein modifications in heat-stressed plants  <cit> . azelaic acid, which is derived from c <dig> fa and contains a double bond at carbon  <dig>  was shown to prime systemic acquired resistance   <cit> .

stearoyl-acp desaturase  is a key enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of stearic acid  to oleic acid  during de novo fa biosynthesis and produces monounsaturated fas in plant cells  <cit> . the arabidopsis thaliana genome has seven sacpd isoforms  <cit> . ssi <dig> is an sacpd isoform that can cause severe growth defects, including spontaneous necrosis and deformed leaves, when mutated. analysis of plant pathogen resistance showed that the absence of ssi <dig> activates defense responses and leads to elevated salicylic acid  levels and constitutive expression of pathogenesis-related  genes, which results in enhanced resistance to several pathogens, such as peronospora parasitica, pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato  and cucumber mosaic virus . others s-acp-des isozymes have greatly reduced specific activities compared to ssi <dig>  and knock-out mutations in s-acp-des  <dig> and  <dig> do not alter defense phenotypes. the observations demonstrate that ssi <dig> is the predominant sacpd isoform that regulates defense signaling  <cit> .

using genetic approaches, an ssi2- <dig> suppressor was isolated, namely act <dig>  which encodes a glycerol-3-phosphate  acyltransferase . act <dig> is a key enzyme that catalyzes the acylation of g3p with 18: <dig> to form lysophophatidic acid . a mutation in act <dig> reduced the conversion of 18: <dig> to lyso-pa and recovered the content of 18: <dig> in ssi2- <dig> mutants, which resulted in growth restoration and reversion of the altered pathogen response in ssi2- <dig> plants, suggesting that reduced 18: <dig> might be a direct cause of enhanced resistance and retarded growth  <cit> . additionally, restoration of the 18: <dig> levels can occur via second site mutations in g3p dehydrogenase   <cit>  and acyl carrier protein  <dig>  <cit> .

as chloroplastic 18: <dig> is distributed in the chloroplast, the effect that 18: <dig> reduction has on nucleus-encoded resistance genes remains elusive  <cit> . a possible explanation is that the decreased 18: <dig> might lead to an accumulation of noa <dig> protein, which in turn accelerates no production and transcriptionally up-regulates no-responsive nuclear genes, thereby activating disease resistance  <cit> .

this 18:1-derived resistance appears to be conserved among different plant species. plants with a reduction of sacpd isoforms showed increased resistance to pathogenic bacteria and oomycetes in rice  <cit>  and soybean  <cit> , respectively. similarly, enhanced resistance to rice blast was observed in rice osssi <dig> knockout mutants  <cit> . this is not the case in arabidopsis, as the ssi2- <dig> mutation enhanced resistance to powdery mildew  <cit>  but showed impaired resistance to b. cinerea  <cit> . in addition to pathogen resistance, characterizing an arabidopsis fab <dig> mutant, which is a ssi <dig> null mutant that differs from ssi2- <dig>  revealed that ssi <dig> plays a role in plant development and abiotic adaption, particularly to high temperatures. plants harboring fab <dig> mutations are extremely small compared with wild-type plants  <cit> . microscopic analysis demonstrated that the fab <dig> mutation lead to defective cell expansion in the mesophyll and epidermal layers of leaves. surprisingly, high temperatures could ameliorate the severe growth defects of fab <dig> mutants, which was not correlated with the fatty acid composition. a possible explanation is that this restoration is due to increased membrane fluidity at higher temperature  <cit> .

defense can be costly to the plant, and the expression of defense genes can have negative effects on plant development, which to some degree counterbalances their positive effects  <cit> . lesion mimic mutants  always have an altered plant form, such as snc1- <dig>  lsd <dig>  lsd <dig>  dll <dig>  hrl <dig>  which display reduced plant size. further, pcd-induced leaf necrosis may be correlated with the activation of resistance responses  <cit> . here, molecular analysis, histological staining and transcriptional profiling reveal that a weak mutation of ssi <dig> causes punctate necrotic spots and enhanced resistance to the bacterial pathogen pst dc <dig>  with a degree of resistance less than that of ssi2- <dig> and the t-dna mutant, but the degree of growth disruption was also reduced. this mutant thus provides important information for potential genetic engineering to improve disease resistance.

RESULTS
ssi2- <dig> shows decreased growth and increased disease resistance
to dissect the mechanism for plant immunity, we screened for mutants that display significant lmm phenotype using ethyl methanesulfonate -mutagenized arabidopsis thaliana ecotype columbia . by close observation, one mutant was found to have many small white spots on its mature leaves and was isolated and designated ssi2- <dig> based on map-based cloning results . mature ssi2- <dig> plants displayed growth defects, as shown by its small and narrow leaves compared to those of wild-type plants . to validate whether these white spots were due to programmed cell death , we carried out trypan blue staining, a widely used approach for selective detection of dead tissues or cells. as expected, many blue spots were found in mature leaves of ssi2- <dig>  indicating that the white spots result from pcd .fig.  <dig> phenotypic differences between the wild-type and ssi2- <dig> mutant plants. a the phenotype of col- <dig> and the ssi2- <dig> mutant plants grown in a culture chamber at 22 °c for 4 weeks. b col- <dig> wild-type and ssi2- <dig> mutants stained with trypan blue. scale bars = 100 μm. c growth of pst dc <dig> in the leaves of wild-type and ssi2- <dig> mutant plants which cultured for 4 weeks. three leaves were harvested from infected leaves and then weighed, together homogenized in 10 mm mgcl <dig>  diluted 105-or 106-fold, and plated on king’ s b medium. the bacterial population was determined from three replicates at each time point by counting colony-forming units . the “0 day” point represents 2 h after bacterial inoculation. each point represents the mean ± standard deviation. the experiments were repeated three times. significance was determined by student’s t test. * p <  <dig> . d the expression of pr <dig>  pr <dig>  pr <dig> in ssi2- <dig> mutants. the test performed by quantitative rt-pcr analysis. transcript abundance of genes was normalized to that of the reference gene actin <dig> . the data are shown as means ± sd from three biological replicates. the experiments were repeated three times. ** p <  <dig> 



to test whether the ssi2- <dig> mutants have altered pathogen resistance, pst dc <dig> was inoculated into wt and ssi2- <dig> mutant plants. the total number of bacteria in ssi2- <dig> leaves was significantly lower than that in wild-type leaves at 3 days post-inoculation , suggesting that ssi2- <dig> exhibited activated resistance responses . the transcriptional levels of several pathogenesis-related genes, including pr <dig> , pr <dig>  and pr <dig>  were significantly up-regulated by  <dig> -fold,  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold, respectively, in ssi2- <dig> compared with wild-type plants . these results demonstrate that ssi2- <dig> is involved in plant disease resistance.

cloning of ssi2- <dig> showed two nucleotide substitutions in the ssi <dig> coding sequence
to clone the gene, a segregating f <dig> population with approximately  <dig>  individuals was generated. in this process, we found that all f <dig> plants showed wt morphology, and all f <dig> seedlings exhibited a near 3: <dig>  segregation of normal:narrow  leaf phenotypes, indicating that ssi2- <dig> is caused by a single-gene recessive mutation. through rough mapping, the mutated gene was located on chromosome ii in a  <dig>  mb region between nga <dig> and cer <dig>  to facilitate fine mapping, new sslps and caps markers were developed in this region and  <dig> new polymorphic markers were generated. by using these newly developed markers, the mutated gene was finely mapped to an  <dig>  kb region . we then designed  <dig> pairs of sequencing primers to re-sequence the entire candidate region. compared to the reference sequence data of col- <dig>  two separate point substitutions were found in the coding region of ssi <dig> , which led to amino acid alterations of a257t and r312h .fig.  <dig> the ssi2- <dig> mutant harbors a new allele of ssi <dig>  a physical mapping of ssi2- <dig>  rough mapping showed that the ssi2- <dig> gene is located between markers nga <dig> and cer <dig> on chromosome  <dig> of arabidopsis. fine mapping revealed the gene between the primers of caps <dig> and ch <dig> , a range of  <dig>  kb. the numbers below the molecular markers indicate the recombinant events detected between the ssi2- <dig> locus and the marker. b structure of the ssi2- <dig> gene, at2g <dig>  at2g <dig> encodes stearoyl desaturase and has three exons and two introns; sequence analysis revealed two point mutations in the third exon of the gene, namely g1952a and g2118a, resulting in changes in amino acids  <dig> and 312



to establish a direct causal link with these mutations, an intact ssi <dig> genomic dna fragment driven by the native ssi <dig> promoter was introduced into ssi2- <dig> plants. normal growth size was observed in pssi2::ssi <dig> transgenic offspring , confirming that growth defects of ssi2- <dig> are caused by ssi <dig> mutations. because ssi2- <dig> has two mutations at the ssi <dig> locus, two different mutated ssi <dig> fragments, pssi2::ssi2a257t and pssi2::ssi2r312h , were also transformed into ssi2- <dig> mutants. surprisingly, both constructs failed to complement the developmental and resistance phenotypes , demonstrating that both mutated amino acids in ssi2- <dig> are key for the functional ssi <dig> phenotype.fig.  <dig> complementation of the ssi2- <dig> mutant. a phenotypes of the transgenic complementation lines. constructs harboring each single mutation did not rescue the dwarf phenotype of ssi2- <dig>  plants were photographed 3 weeks after germination. b the bacterial population of pst dc <dig> in the leaves of wild-type col- <dig>  ssi2- <dig> mutant and transgenic complementation lines. the seedlings were cultured for 4 weeks. three leaves were harvested from infected leaves and then weighed, together homogenized in 10 mm mgcl <dig>  diluted 105-or 106-fold, and plated on king’ s b medium. the bacterial population was determined from three replicates at each time point by counting colony-forming units . the “0 day” point represents 2 h after bacterial inoculation. the data are shown as means ± sd from three biological replicates. the experiments were repeated three times. significance was determined by student’s t test. * p <  <dig> 



ssi <dig> encodes a stearoyl-acp desaturase  that catalyzes the production of oleoyl-acp  from stearoyl-acp   <cit> . the previously characterized recessive mutant ssi2- <dig> lacks nearly 90 % of this enzyme activity and exhibits pleiotropic phenotypes  <cit> . the ssi2- <dig> mutant was originally identified as a genetic suppressor of npr1- <dig> and exhibits constitutively activated plant defense responses without pathogen infection  <cit> . based on these previous results and our current analyses, our newly isolated allele was renamed ssi2- <dig> 

ssi2- <dig> shows intermediate phenotypes in development and disease resistance
to further study the function of ssi <dig>  we analyzed ssi2- <dig> mutants  <cit>  and a t-dna insertion line  . based on the sequence information in the tair database, the t-dna insertion of ssi2- <dig> is located in the first intron of ssi <dig> . obvious differences in phenotype were observed after cultivating these mutants in the growth chamber. the biomasses of ssi2- <dig> and ssi2- <dig> plants were  <dig>  and  <dig>  % compared to that of ssi2- <dig>  respectively . trypan blue staining showed that all three ssi <dig> mutants exhibited clear cell necrosis; differences in the necrotic areas were not noticeable among the three mutants .fig.  <dig> allele structure and phenotypic differences in ssi2- <dig>  ssi2- <dig> and ssi2- <dig>  a the c-to-t mutation in ssi2- <dig> at nucleotide position  <dig> changes the leucine  at amino acid position  <dig> to a phenylalanine   <cit> . the tair database shows the t-dna insertion in the first intron of ssi <dig> in ssi2- <dig> . b the phenotype of the col- <dig> wild-type and different ssi <dig> lines grown in a culture chamber at 22 °c for 4 weeks. c biomass analyses of the indicated lines. the wild-type and mutants were cultured for 4 weeks at 22 °c. data were analyzed by one-way anova, and mean separation was calculated by multiple comparison tukey’s test . nine plants were used as biological replicates for each. d ros quantitation in the leaves of wt , ssi2- <dig>  ssi2- <dig> and ssi2- <dig> plants. the leaves directly treated with 10 mm h2dcf-da dissolved in pbs at 37 °c for 30 min. the epidermis was isolated and the fluorescence intensity was monitored. quantification of ros was performed using an imagepro plus analysis package



ros burst is an important symbol of the plant disease resistance. quantitation of ros showed that the ssi2- <dig> mutant accumulated lower ros level than the ssi2- <dig> and ssi2- <dig> mutants . nitroblue tetrazolium  and  <dig>  3′-diaminobenzidine  staining detected accumulation of superoxide and peroxide, respectively. the staining patterns confirmed the model of ros quantitation . we used aniline blue staining to monitor callose deposition in leaf tissues. bright blue staining in the mutants indicated that there was spontaneous callose deposition in the leaves of all three mutant lines . these results are consistent with the known association between ssi <dig> and pathogen resistance.

in wild-type arabidopsis plants, pr genes can be activated by various types of biotic stress. pr <dig> is a marker gene for the sa signaling pathway in plants  <cit> . the ssi2- <dig>  ssi2- <dig> and ssi2- <dig> mutants were capable of self-activating pr <dig> expression, which showed increases of  <dig> -,  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold, respectively, compared to the wild-type plants in the absence of exogenous sa, respectively, suggesting that ssi <dig> deficiency leads to constitutive activation of sa signaling. after treatment with exogenous sa, the expression of wild-type plants increased by  <dig> -fold, while the ssi2- <dig>  ssi2- <dig> and ssi2- <dig> plant expression levels increased by  <dig> -,  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold , respectively, indicating that pr <dig> expression can be further up-regulated after sa treatment.fig.  <dig> marker gene expression, sa content and bacterial growth in col- <dig> and different ssi <dig> mutant lines. col- <dig> and different ssi <dig> mutant lines were treated with water and 50 μm salicylic acid  or 50 μm jasmonic acid , and samples were taken 24 h after treatment. the expression levels of pr <dig>  and pdf <dig> , vsp <dig>  are shown. the test performed by quantitative rt-pcr analysis. transcript abundance of genes was normalized to that of the reference gene actin <dig> . the data are shown as means ± sd from three biological replicates. the experiments were repeated three times. ** p <  <dig> . c sa levels in the leaves of wt , ssi2- <dig>  ssi2- <dig> and ssi2- <dig> plants. d growth of pst dc <dig> in the leaves of wild-type and different ssi <dig> mutant lines cultured for 4 weeks. the  <dig> d time point represents 2 h after bacterial inoculation. the data are shown as means ± sd from three biological replicates. the experiments were repeated three times. significance was determined by student’s t test. *indicates significant differences at p <  <dig> , ** indicates significant differences at p <  <dig> 



pdf <dig>  and vsp <dig> can serve as marker genes for ja signaling  <cit> . the expression of pdf <dig>  in ssi2- <dig> was similar to that of wild-type, but in ssi2- <dig> and ssi2- <dig> mutants, the expression of pdf <dig>  was significantly reduced to  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold, respectively, of that of the wild-type. after treatment with exogenous ja, the expression of wild-type plants was up-regulated by approximately 4-fold, while that of the ssi2- <dig>  ssi2- <dig> and ssi2- <dig> mutants increased by approximately  <dig> -fold compared to the wild-type. a similar result also observed in vsp <dig> gene expression analysis . these results are consistent with the northern blot results showing that several ja-inducible defense responses are impaired in ssi2- <dig> plants  <cit>  and demonstrating that the ja signaling pathway is also impaired in ssi2- <dig> and ssi2- <dig> 

we also measured the sa content in mutant leaves. as shown in fig. 5c, ssi2- <dig>  ssi2- <dig> and ssi2- <dig> mutants had approximately 8-, 2- and 5-fold higher levels of sa than wild-type plants, respectively. consistent with these results, all ssi <dig> mutants exhibited resistance phenotypes. the total amount of bacteria in wild-type leaves was  <dig> -,  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold higher than that in ssi2- <dig>  ssi2- <dig> and ssi2- <dig> leaves . in terms of resistance, the ssi2- <dig> mutant showed the strongest resistance, while the ssi2- <dig> mutant had the weakest resistance.

ssi <dig> is located in the chloroplast. we also determined the subcellular location of ssi <dig> in the mutant ssi2- <dig> and ssi2a257t, ssi2r312h mutants. similar to the wt, a protein with two mutated amino acids  or single amino acid mutations  was located in the chloroplast , indicating that point mutations in ssi2- <dig> did not affect the subcellular localization of the protein.

the 18: <dig> content is decreased in ssi2-2
because ssi <dig> is an isoform of s-acp-des that converts 18: <dig> to 18: <dig>  <cit> , the ssi2- <dig> mutation may alter its activity, which in turn would affect 18: <dig> production. to examine this, we directly measured the oleic acid content of wt and ssi <dig> mutants. in wild-type plants, the oleic acid content was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/g. in contrast, a significant decrease was observed in all ssi <dig> mutants . compared with ssi2- <dig> and ssi2- <dig> mutants, the ssi2- <dig> mutants had higher levels of oleic acid , indicating that ssi2- <dig> is a weak allele.fig.  <dig> oleic acid content in leaf tissues of col- <dig>  ssi2- <dig>  ssi2- <dig> and ssi2- <dig> plants. all measurements were made on plants grown at 22 °c for 4 weeks, and data are presented as μg ± sd . significance was determined by student’s t test. *indicates significant differences at p <  <dig> , ** indicates significant differences at p <  <dig> 



ssi <dig> regulated the expression of genes involved in sa and iaa pathways
to elucidate the mechanism underlying the observed phenotype of ssi <dig> mutants, an rna sequencing experiment was conducted . compared to wild-type, thousands of genes displayed significant changes in transcript levels in all mutants. specifically, the ssi2- <dig> mutant had  <dig>  up-regulated genes and  <dig>  down-regulated genes. the total number of up-regulated genes  and down-regulated genes  was identified in ssi2- <dig> and ssi2- <dig> mutants, respectively .fig.  <dig> gene expression profiling. a statistics for transcriptome sequencing of col- <dig> and three ssi <dig> mutants. b quantitative rt-pcr analysis of three sa pathway genes to validate the rna-seq data of up-regulated genes. the data are shown as means ± sd from three biological replicates. the experiments were repeated two times. significance was determined by student’s t test. ** indicates significant differences at p <  <dig> 



because all three mutants showed increased resistance to pst dc <dig> and reduced growth size, after integrated analysis of the rna-seq data, the common  <dig> up-regulated genes and  <dig> down-regulated genes were identified in all three mutants. using the ssi2- <dig> mutant as an intermediate control,  <dig> of the  <dig> up-regulated genes showed reduced expression in the ssi2- <dig> mutant compared to the ssi2- <dig> and ssi2- <dig> mutants, in accordance with the “weak mutant” phenotype. go annotations were assigned to the differentially expressed genes in the mutant lines, and panther  <cit>  analysis revealed a significant enrichment in immune system processes and sa signaling pathways among these genes , which is consistent with the previous conclusion that the sa pathway is associated with low levels of oleic acid. to validate the data of the rna-seq experiments, the expression levels of pad <dig> , eds <dig> , and ics <dig>  were tested by quantitative rt-pcr and exhibited the same expression pattern . in addition, genes categorized as response to chitin  and response to nitrogen compounds  were significantly enriched in the analysis, implying that ssi <dig> also mediated additional resistance responses.

we tried to analyze the molecular mechanism controlling the developmental phenotype of the ssi <dig> mutants. abnormal growth phenotypes are often closely related to plant hormones. by agrigo  <cit>  analysis, for the hormone-related go annotation, the highest degree of enrichment of the  <dig> down-regulated genes was response to auxin stimulus  , suggesting that reduced oleic acid may inhibit auxin-mediated pathways, affecting the developmental process. further analysis identified that  <dig> genes out of  <dig> genes were auxin-related . by using quantitative rt-pcr,  <dig> out of  <dig> auxin-related genes showed less repression in the ssi2- <dig> mutant than in the ssi2- <dig> and the ssi2- <dig> mutants. notably, saur <dig> , saur <dig> , saur <dig> , saur <dig> , and saur <dig>  belong to a subgroup of small auxin up rna  genes which have been reported to be connected with plant leave size  <cit> . another two saur proteins, saur <dig>  and saur <dig> , play a role in organ development  <cit> . iaa <dig>  and iaa <dig>  as two early auxin-induced transcription factors, were also significantly repressed in ssi <dig> mutants. these results imply that the auxin mediated pathway combines with the ssi2-mediated pathway to produce the narrow-leaf dwarf phenotype.fig.  <dig> several iaa pathway genes were significant down-regulated in ssi <dig> mutant. a the description of agrigo analysis about the hormones-related go enrichment. the numbers marked in parentheses were p values. the grid marked with deeper color-coded means higher significantly enrichment. b quantitative rt-pcr analysis of ten iaa pathway genes to validate the rna-seq data of down-regulated genes. the data are shown as means ± sd from three biological replicates. the experiments were repeated two times. significance was determined by student’s t test. *indicates significant differences at p <  <dig> , ** indicates significant differences at p <  <dig> 



discussion
the ssi2- <dig> mutant was previously identified as being resistant to pathogens, and the ssi2- <dig> npr <dig> double mutant was susceptible to pst dc <dig>  it was suggested that resistance to pst dc <dig> which was mediated by ssi2- <dig>  depended on npr <dig>  however, depletion of npr <dig> could not suppress the increased sa content, development of spontaneous necrotic spots and constitutively high expression of pr genes in ssi2- <dig>  demonstrating that ssi <dig> also mediates a npr1-independent pathway  <cit> . the ssi2- <dig> mutant also displayed constitutive expression of pr genes , spontaneous necrosis and pathogen resistance, demonstrating that ssi2- <dig> is a novel allele of ssi <dig>  applying exogenous sa to ssi <dig> mutants increased the expression of pr genes. these results, combined with the fact that ssi <dig> mutants are only resistant to biotrophic pathogens and are highly susceptible to necrotrophic pathogens, suggest that ssi2-mediated resistance is principally dependent on the sa pathway. mutations in ssi <dig> may regulate the sa signaling pathway, but are not necessarily involved in this pathway, and ssi <dig> functions upstream of the eds <dig> gene  <cit> .

compared to the ssi2- <dig> and ssi2- <dig> mutants, the overall growth of ssi2- <dig> plants was significantly higher . ssi2- <dig> carries two amino acid substitutions that are not located in the central activated region of the enzyme. the improved growth might be explained by higher enzymatic activity in ssi2- <dig> plants compared to ssi2- <dig> and ssi2- <dig> plants which is supported by a smaller decrease in oleic acid in ssi2- <dig> plants . several indicators of disease resistance, such as the leaf ros levels, pr gene expression levels and number of bacterial colonies after infection, were also intermediate in the ssi2- <dig> mutant, between those of wild-type plants and ssi2- <dig> and ssi2- <dig> mutants . these characteristics support the conclusion that ssi2- <dig> is a new weak mutant allele of ssi <dig>  by sequence alignment, the corresponding site of arabidopsis ala <dig> is ala <dig> in castor, which is close to the pairs of iron binding helices  <cit> . iron binding plays a key role in interrupting the c-h bond of the fatty acid chain  <cit> . does the a257t mutation in arabidopsis interfere with iron binding, thereby reducing enzyme activity? it remains unclear. via subunit structure analysis in castor, arg <dig>  which corresponds with arg <dig> in arabidopsis, is predicted to interact with asp <dig> after the eighth α-helix and before the second β-hairpin  <cit> . therefore, the r312h mutation in ssi2- <dig> was hypothesized to interfere with the structure of ssi <dig>  resulting in decreased enzyme activity.

decreased enzymatic activity alone seems insufficient to explain ssi2-mediated resistance. the 18: <dig> content was similar between ssi2- <dig> and ssi2- <dig> plants, but the sa content in ssi2- <dig> leaves was much higher than in ssi2- <dig> leaves, and the resistance of the ssi2- <dig> mutant was also obviously stronger than that of the ssi2- <dig> mutant. one explanation is that ssi <dig> interacts with other proteins or macromolecules, that are necessary for ssi2-mediated signaling.

what is the relationship between reduced oleic acid levels and disease resistance? in expression profiling analysis, we focused on two specific enriched go items , considering the facts that 18: <dig> regulates no production in the chloroplast  <cit>  and chitin is regarded to be a typical pathogen-associated molecular patterns   <cit> . lower 18: <dig> levels perhaps not only regulated the downstream sa signaling pathway but also acted as an earlier signal in the plant resistance response.

we also observed that many auxin-related genes showed altered transcriptional levels in the mutants . specifically, some saur and iaa genes were down-regulated and confirmed by qpcr , suggesting that these iaa response genes are probably involved in the regulation of leaf development in ssi <dig> mutants. generally, elevated salicylic acid inhibits pathogen growth by through repression of the auxin signaling pathway  <cit> . because ssi <dig> mutants activated sa and other disease resistance signaling pathways, these pathways may have antagonized the iaa signaling pathways and regulated saur-mediated developmental signaling by an unknown mechanism.

CONCLUSIONS
previous studies have demonstrated the genes involved in photosynthesis and growth were down-regulated during induced resistance  <cit> . however, few studies have focused on the costs and trade-offs associated with induced resistance to pathogens. the limiting effect of disease resistance on yield should continue to be studied. the ssi2- <dig> and ssi2- <dig> mutants show dwarf phenotypes, and sacpd gene silencing significantly reduced soybean plant height and seed yield  <cit> . these results demonstrate that high disease resistance often comes at a great cost to plants. accordingly, the weak ssi2- <dig> mutant presented a better balance between resistance and growth which could be a great advantage in crop breeding, especially in plants with lower fatty acid requirements, such as vegetables and trees, in which pathogen resistance could be gained with little effect on growth. for crops with stricter requirements in terms of fatty acid composition, such as canola and corn, we could also develop a strategy to breed lines that have leaves that are low in oleic acid, but that have seeds that contain an unchanged fatty acid composition to achieve a balance between plant growth and pathogen resistance. our research therefore provides a theoretical basis for choosing effective resistance breeding strategies.
