BACKGROUND
the discovery of the genetic processes causing and accompanying speciation has been a long-standing challenge for evolutionary biologists. however, good study systems are rare. model study systems would ideally include species that are firstly sympatric and secondly very recently diverged, with an effective mechanism of mating isolation. additionally, the species should be amenable to forced mating in the lab to allow genetic analysis. in this paper, we present genomic resources to underpin the study of three sympatric tephritid fruit fly species that fulfil all these criteria. the three species are shown in figure  <dig>  for the major species, queensland fruit fly, b. tryoni, we present a draft genome and annotation. for the two other sympatric species, b. neohumeralis and b. jarvisi, we present unscaffolded draft genomes to establish the genetic relations between the three species.figure  <dig> 
the
bactrocera
species used in the present study. panel a shows a b. tryoni male on the left and a male b. neohumeralis on the right. the species can be distinguished by the colour of the humeral calli  on the anterior of the thorax, which is yellow in b. tryoni and dark in b. neohumeralis. b. neohumeralis usually have a darker body colour. panel b shows a male b. jarvisi, which is distinguished from the other two species by the extra yellow marking immediately posterior to the humeral callus, the lighter body colour, clear costal cells on the anterior wing margin and abdominal stripes.



the economic importance of b. tryoni has prompted intense research interest for over  <dig> years. in australia, b. tryoni is the most serious economic pest of horticulture and a major target for international and domestic quarantine efforts  <cit> . b. neohumeralis and b. jarvisi are also pests of economic importance and are sympatric with b. tryoni throughout most of tropical australia  <cit> . various bactrocera species are major economic pests of fleshy fruit production in the asia-pacific region while ecologically comparable genera are major pests in other parts of the world: ceratitis  in afrotropical regions, anastrepha in central and south america and rhagoletis in europe and north america  <cit> .

b. tryoni and b. neohumeralis are identified by a morphological difference in the colour of the humeral calli  and a behavioural difference in time of mating: b. tryoni mates in a narrow window of falling light intensity at dusk, whereas b. neohumeralis mates in bright light during the middle of the day . a dna microsatellite-based survey found no evidence of hybridisation between the species in the wild  <cit> . however, interspecies hybrids can readily be produced in the laboratory by caging males of one species with females of the other   <cit> . these hybrids are viable and fertile, and can be maintained indefinitely. not surprisingly, b. tryoni and b. neohumeralis appear extremely similar in dna comparisons. previous sequencing of nuclear and mitochondrial sequences found evidence of only one potential fixed difference in a ribosomal spacer region, its <dig>  among a large range of shared polymorphisms  <cit> .

the third species is jarvis’ fruit fly, bactrocera jarvisi, which is an emergent pest of a number of cultivated fruits in northern australia. it has a more restricted range of host-fruits  <cit>  and appears to be limited in geographic distribution by the distribution of its main endemic host, planchonia careya
 <cit> . b. jarvisi is morphologically quite distinct from b. tryoni and b. neohumeralis  and has been placed in a different subgenus of the bactrocera
 <cit> . dna studies have shown that this different subgeneric status may not be warranted, but b. jarvisi is sufficiently differentiated that it has formed a convenient outgroup for dna sequence comparisons between b. tryoni and b. neohumeralis
 <cit> . surprisingly, b. jarvisi can also be forced to mate with both b. tryoni and b. neohumeralis, with a substantial proportion of viable, fertile hybrids  <cit> .

therefore the three australian pest tephritids, which can be hybridised and subjected to selection experiments, constitute a formidable model system that allows genetic and molecular analyses of a number of traits related to pest status – host fruit preferences, lure and odorant attractancy and invasive potential. further, the apparent extreme similarity between b. tryoni and b. neohumeralis provides a model to investigate genome evolution and maintenance of separate species status, and the morphological differentiation of b. jarvisi allows investigation of the molecular mechanisms of morphological development and developmental canalisation.

RESULTS
sequencing and de novoassembly
the sequence data used for the de novo assembly of the male b. tryoni genome is summarized in additional file  <dig>  the b. tryoni data consisted of  <dig> gbp of paired-end data, representing approximately  <dig> times coverage assuming a genome size of approximately  <dig> mbp . for the related species b. neohumeralis and b. jarvisi we obtained  <dig> gbp and  <dig> gbp of  <dig> bp paired-end illumina hiseq data respectively. the assembly of the b. tryoni genome was performed using abyss ver  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  to construct contigs followed by scaffolding with sspace  <cit> , as detailed in the methods section. the statistics of the resulting assembly are shown in table  <dig>  only five scaffolds containing bacterial sequences were detected and these were removed from the assembly. due to a lack of mate pair data, b. neohumeralis and b. jarvisi remained unscaffolded.table  <dig>

note that only the b. tryoni genome was scaffolded.



to assess the completeness of the coding regions in the genome assembly, we used the cegma set of conserved orthologs  <cit> . complete sequences were found for  <dig> % of the  <dig> genes that constitute the core gene set. inclusion of partial matches increased that percentage to  <dig> %, indicating that the assembly of coding regions was near-complete. only  <dig> % of matches had more than one ortholog within the assembly suggesting that the assembly contained only a low level of alternate coding assemblies. the mitochondrial genome of b. tryoni emerged from the assembly as a single scaffold with 99% identity with a complete b. tryoni mitochondrial genome  <cit> , with our scaffold containing a possible  <dig> bp duplication in the a + t-rich region.

the same cegma-based approach was used to assess the completeness of the two unscaffolded assemblies. the b. neohumeralis assembly was  <dig> % complete . the b. jarvisi assembly was  <dig> % complete . however, for b. neohumeralis and b. jarvisi 23% and 21% respectively of loci had more than one ortholog. that increase from  <dig> % in b. tryoni suggested that there were more redundant contigs in both those assemblies.

genome size
we first used the k-mer method to estimate genome size  <cit> , using both jellyfish  <cit>  and dsk  <dig>   <cit>  to count 18-mers. for a male-only sample of b. tryoni, the calculated genome size was  <dig> mbp. recently, a sample of female-only dna was sequenced  giving an estimate of  <dig> mbp. the larger female genome size was expected on the basis of cytological evidence  <cit> . however, since these estimates were larger than those expected from other bactrocera genomes  <cit> , we sought alternate estimates of genome size.

our alternative approach to the estimation of genome size was based on the coverage of putative transcripts, with the assumption that many transcripts originate from single copy sequences  <cit> . that assumption was supported in the case of the b. tryoni assembly by the low percentage of orthologs  in the cegma gene set. we first estimated coverage of all  <dig> b. tryoni maker-derived transcripts . we refined this measure to minimise the influence of repetitive sequences and erroneous gene models. using a subset of  <dig> filtered transcripts, we obtained a distinct peak coverage at  <dig>  . variation in stringency of mapping resulted in only a small variation in coverage estimates in the range 41- <dig>  given that the illumina hiseq data contained  <dig>  gb of sequence, the estimated genome size was  <dig> mbp. this was larger than previous estimates for other bactrocera species of  <dig> and  <dig> mbp, but similar to that of another tephritid ragoletis juglandis
 <cit> . however, if the  <dig> % of the cegma genes that had more than one ortholog were misassemblies rather than true orthologs, then the method may over-estimate genome size by as much as 10%.figure  <dig> 
coverage of transcripts. sequencing reads were mapped to all putative transcripts  and a median group of  <dig> transcripts . the reduced set of transcripts was filtered to exclude repetitive sequences and incomplete sequences. the genome size was estimated from the peak of the lower distribution.



repetitive sequence analysis
analyses of repeated sequences in de novo eukaryotic assemblies are sometimes limited to standard implementations of either homology-based searches  or de novo prediction . however, we know that the genomes of b. tryoni, b. neohumeralis and b. jarvisi contain abundant insertions of mariner elements  <cit> , and that partial sequences of other repeated elements have been found within sequenced introns . also, satellite dna sequences receive little attention despite their potential importance to many aspects of genome evolution and regulation  <cit> . therefore, we undertook a detailed analysis of the tandem and dispersed repetitive sequences in b. tryoni.

we identified b. tryoni repetitive sequences from a combination of repeatmodeler de novo predictions, a k-mer extension analysis and manual curation as detailed in the methods section. initially, repeatmodeler produced  <dig> sequences totalling  <dig>  mbp. the k-mer extension analysis was similar to the approach used in  <cit> , in which the highest frequency k-mers found in the raw reads were extended one base pair at a time using the highest abundance k-mers that overlapped the original k-mer by  bases. the use of raw reads greatly increases the likelihood of finding repeats, such as satellite dna, that are not easily incorporated into an assembly. our k-mer extension produced hundreds of fragments in the range  <dig> –  <dig> bp. among the  <dig> most abundant sequences were five potential satellite dna sequences. in b. tryoni, these sequences ranged from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp, typical of alphoid satellite dna  <cit> . for both b. neohumeralis and b. jarvisi, the k-mer extension analysis identified variants of the same five satellite sequences . the k-mer extension approach also refined the repeatmodeler output, which identified the same satellite sequences but in a variety of tandem arrays of 2- <dig> repeats. the remaining sequences produced by the k-mer analysis were mostly fragments of transposons. table  <dig> summarises the classification and abundance of those elements.table  <dig>

the variable elements count refers the total numbers of elements that vary from the canonical sequence by a single nucleotide substitution, insertion or deletion. total mbp is the total length of sequence of that satellite per genome calculated by multiplying the length of the element by the number of variable elements. for b. neohumeralis and b. jarvisi only the number of variable elements is shown since the genome size was not estimated.
summary of the
b. tryoni
dispersed repetitive sequences


the number of elements was estimated using repeatmasker with the repeat library prepared in this study.



the genomic arrangement of the putative satellite sequences  was again investigated in the raw reads. the analysis described in the methods section showed that these putative satellite sequences were predominantly in large head-to-tail tandem arrays, typical of satellite dna. analysis of higher order patterns in the tandem arrays is an objective of future work.

the final step in the identification of b. tryoni-specific repeats was a manual curation using an iterative alignment and extension of the remaining repeatmodeler de novo sequences. that process identified the consensus of mainly transposon-related sequences. the final output was a set of  <dig> b. tryoni-specific repeat sequences ranging between  <dig> and  <dig> bp in length, with a total length of  <dig> kb. these sequences were classified on the basis of homology to dipteran repbase sequences  <cit>  and are presented in additional file  <dig>  to estimate proportion of the genome consisting of those  <dig> repetitive sequences, we mapped the  <dig> million b. tryoni illumina hiseq reads to the b. tryoni-specific repeats. this suggested that approximately one third of the b. tryoni genome consists of repetitive dna .

the utility of the b. tryoni-specific repeat library can be illustrated by comparing the masking ability of repeatmasker  <cit>  with and without the b. tryoni-specific repeat library. using repeatmasker with default parameters and the repbase repeat library  <cit> ,  <dig> mbp of the b. tryoni assembly was masked. inclusion of our b. tryoni-specific repeat library increased the masking almost 5-fold to  <dig> mbp. the masking does not increase to 30% of the assembly since most satellite sequences and many transposon fragments were likely to be under-represented in the assembly.

since b. neohumeralis and b. jarvisi both show very low sequence divergence from b. tryoni , homologs of the b. tryoni repeat sequences were constructed for the other two species by simply selecting the related repeats and substituting the most common single nucleotide polymorphisms or small indels from the second species. for each species, raw reads were then mapped to the appropriate set of repeats to estimate coverage for the repeated sequences. for b. neohumeralis, 33% of illumina hiseq reads mapped to the b. neohumeralis repeats . for b. jarvisi,  <dig> % of reads mapped to the b. jarvisi repeats . thus for each of the three species, approximately one third of the raw sequencing reads mapped to the  <dig> kb of repetitive sequences listed in additional file  <dig> 

ribosomal rna  genes are expected to occur in large tandem arrays containing hundreds of copies of the loci. sequence heterogeneity among the many loci affects assembly from short genomic sequencing reads  <cit> . consequently, we manually assembled the consensus rrna transcribed unit using similar methods to those used to assemble the other classes of dispersed repetitive dna, an approach previously used with drosophila
 <cit> . the intergenic spacer regions  joining the transcribed units were not completely assembled due their highly repetitive nature. the rrna consensus sequences for each of the three bactrocera species showed the usual tandem arrangement of 18s,  <dig> s, 2s and 28s genes. transcriptomic assemblies confirmed our assembled sequence of the b. tryoni transcribed unit . the alignment of the three sequences, along with the d. melanogaster rrna sequence, is included in additional file  <dig>  which confirms the difference between the b. tryoni/b. neohumeralis its <dig> found in an earlier study  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows the occurrence of sequence variants for the three bactrocera species . in all three species, variation was reduced in the 28s and 18s regions with a greater reduction in the 28s locus. our results parallel those for drosophila
 <cit> , where higher frequency variants  tended to be concentrated in the internal transcribed spacer  and igs regions.figure  <dig> 
the comparative frequency of variants across the rrna locus. the proportion of sites that vary from the consensus rrna sequence is shown for b. tryoni , b. neohumeralis  and b. jarvisi . variation was measured from the consensus sequence for that species. the consensus sequence for b. jarvisi is only  <dig> bp  due to shorter assembled igs sequences. the bar below the graph indicates the rrna unit, with the four rrna loci shown in black. the limits of the four rrna loci are based on the d. melanogaster sequence. igs = intergenic spacer , ets = external transcribed sequence, its <dig> and 2 = internal transcribed sequences.



comparisons between the three bactrocera species showed that b. tryoni and b. neohumeralis have relatively few inter-species rrna sequence differences. b. jarvisi shows greater differentiation from both b. tryoni and b. neohumeralis, particularly in the its and igs. the differentiation of the b. jarvisi igs was sufficient to prevent meaningful sequence alignment with the igs of the other two species.

the amount of sequence variation also differed between the three species . the incidence of variants in the b. tryoni sequence reads was almost twice that of b. neohumeralis. variation in the b. jarvisi data was as low as b. neohumeralis in the transcribed rrna unit but higher than b. tryoni in the igs and external transcribed spacer  region. the extra variation in b. tryoni was unlikely to have resulted from differences in levels of inbreeding because pooled sequencing data from  <dig> wild caught individuals showed no increase in heterogeneity over the sequencing data from our highly inbred strain of b. tryoni , suggesting that the extra heterogeneity exists among the rrna repeats of any one individual. the selective pressures operating on rrna sequence variants both between and within individuals that may produce these varying patterns of heterozygosity are unclear.

annotation
annotation of the b. tryoni genome was performed using the maker pipeline  <cit> . evidence use to create gene models comprised de novo transcriptomes and gene models from c. capitata and d. melanogaster. for repeat masking, we used a combination of the repbase dipteran library  <cit>  and the b. tryoni-specific repeats identified above. default parameters were used except that potential intron length was extended to  <dig> kbp.

the set of  <dig> gene predictions produced by maker were subsequently classified using a local installation of blast2go  <cit> . of the  <dig> input sequences,  <dig> produced blast alignments with an ncbi invertebrate reference sequence library.  <dig> of those gene models were successfully annotated with gene ontology terms.  <dig> sequences were annotated with interproscan. that same annotation process was repeated for the c. capitata and d. melanogaster gene models and the comparison of the resulting classifications is shown in figure  <dig>  the similarity of these classifications suggests that our assembly and annotation are reasonably complete. however, differences in the number of gene models for each species and the greater representation of drosophilids in the databases used by interproscan mean that at this stage it would be difficult to reliably interpret the relative differences in the gene ontology terms.figure  <dig> 
gene ontology comparison. each graph compares the classification of the putative b. tryoni transcripts  with the annotations of c. capitata  and d. melanogaster . panel a: biological processes. panel b: molecular function. panel c: cellular components. the relative distributions support the conclusion that the assembly contains a near-complete assembly of coding dna.



comparison with other diptera
to assess the overall composition of the b. tryoni gene model set, we compared it to gene model sets from two other dipterans: c. capitata and d. melanogaster. table  <dig> shows that the sizes  of the  <dig> b. tryoni gene models was comparable to c. capitata and d. melanogaster.table  <dig> 
comparison of the number and size range of the gene models for the three dipteran species shown


b. tryoni
c. capitata
d. melanogaster


to comparatively assess the overall composition of our b. tryoni gene models, we used orthomcl  <cit> , which groups transcripts by sequence similarity. although the three sets of gene models contain different numbers of gene models  reflecting the different annotation history and stage of curation, this comparison provides an indication of the overall completeness of our assembly. orthomcl produced  <dig> orthologous groups and figure  <dig> shows the overlap of those groups between the three species. of the orthologous groups, 65% contained representatives from all three species and only 3% of groups were b. tryoni-specific. while that high degree of overlap suggests that the b. tryoni assembly is reasonably complete, a caveat is that the c. capitata and d. melanogaster gene models were included in the b. tryoni maker annotation as part of the evidence used to create the b. tryoni gene predictions. nevertheless, our b. tryoni gene models do not appear to be a simple subset of the other two species, since both b. tryoni and c. capitata are equally distinct from d. melanogaster and each other.figure  <dig> 
overlap of protein orthologous groups for
b. tryoni
,
c. capitata
and
d. melanogaster
. the gene models for all three species were grouped according to similarity using orthomcl. the venn diagram shows the number of groups that included gene models from either one, two or three of the species. areas of overlap are proportional to the counts shown. for all three species, 2-4% of gene models occurred in species-specific groups.



within each ortholog group, closely-related species would be expected to have a similar numbers of gene models. as a result, the ratio of gene models within groups should be approximately 1: <dig>  for each orthologous group, we calculated that ratio for each species pair. figure  <dig> shows that, of the three pairwise comparisons, b. tryoni and c. capitata had the most groups with an approximate 1: <dig> ratio. presumably that result is due not only to similarity of the species but also to the similar annotation methods used. both pairwise comparisons involving d. melanogaster showed more groups with a 1: <dig> ratio rather than a 1: <dig> ratio. this must be due in part to the greater number of gene models available for d. melanogaster. despite that bias, 80-84% of ratios were in the range 1: <dig> to 1: <dig>  indicating that most ortholog groups contain similar number of gene models.figure  <dig> 
relative size of orthologous groups of
b. tryoni
,

and
d. melanogaster. the gene models within each orthologous group produced by orthomcl were classified according to species of origin. for each species pair, the ratio of the number of gene models was then calculated on a pairwise basis. the histogram shows the counts for the ratio indicated on the x-axis. for each species pair, the most common ratio was 1: <dig> indicating a strong correspondence of gene models between species. however, the ratios for d. melanogaster in particular are biased downward due to the greater number of gene models available for that species.



the possibility of gene enrichment was investigated in the  <dig> orthologous groups that contained only b. tryoni gene models. those groups contained  <dig> gene models , which were annotated with gene ontology and pfam terms using blast2go. of the longer sequences, less than 50% were either fragments of gene models in multi-species ortholog groups or transposon-related sequences. the possibility that the remaining gene models represent novel b. tryoni genes is a subject of future investigation.

substitution rates between bactroceraspecies
the small genetic distance between b. tryoni and b. neohumeralis was reflected in the nucleotide substitution rates between the two species. we partitioned fixed inter-species nucleotide substitutions between exons, introns, utrs and non-coding dna, with exon substitution rates being further classified as synonymous or non-synonymous . the observed substitution rates between b. tryoni and either b. neohumeralis or b. jarvisi were lower than that reported between, for example, drosophila species . the non-synonymous versus synonymous ratio dn/ds  was approximately  <dig> , which is consistent with some degree of purifying selection affecting each species.table  <dig> 
substitution rates in

and

assembly


b. neohumeralis
b. jarvisi


in the raw b. neohumeralis illumina hiseq data,  <dig> instances of apparently novel stop codons were found . the majority of these occurred either in alternate transcripts  or sequences that had no blast results , while some stop codons were close to the end of the b. tryoni-version of the transcript. differential expression of these is currently under investigation as part of a comparative transcriptomics project . during investigation of these potential novel stop codons, we also found  <dig> instances where a substitution, if considered in isolation, would have produced a new stop codon. however, in each of those  <dig> potential transcripts, a second substitution in the same codon negated the effect of the first substitution.

the close similarity between the species at the sequence level allowed illumina hiseq data from both b. neohumeralis and b. jarvisi to be mapped against the b. tryoni assembly. for b. neohumeralis,  <dig> % of reads mapped to the b. tryoni assembly with a mapping quality q >  <dig>  by comparison, only  <dig> % b. jarvisi reads mapped to the b. tryoni assembly with quality q >  <dig> 

indel variation between bactroceraspecies
since we did not have scaffolded assemblies for either b. neohumeralis or b. jarvisi, we were unable to reliably investigate syntenic differences between the species. however, the sequence similarity was exploited to identify a large number of deletions in the b. neohumeralis and b. jarvisi sequence data relative to the b. tryoni scaffolds. gapped alignment programs  were used to identify b. tryoni scaffold segments with zero coverage. these were then filtered to extract only those deletions with high, precisely aligned coverage on both sides of the deletion. for b. neohumeralis, of  <dig> initial deletions over 10bp, only  <dig> had sufficient coverage on both flanks to be investigated further. for b. jarvisi,  <dig> initial deletions were reduced to  <dig> 

since transposons may play a significant role in sequence evolution, species as closely related as b. tryoni and b. neohumeralis provide an opportunity to investigate the possible involvement of transposons in the earliest stages of genome divergence. using the deletions identified above, we extracted the  <dig> bp genomic segments adjacent to each of the deletions identified in b. neohumeralis and b. jarvisi. a blastn search of these flanking sequences, using the species-specific repeat library , showed that 32% of sequences contained repetitive elements. however, this level of association between repetitive sequences and the deletions was not significant. using the same blastn parameters,  <dig> sets of the same number of random genomic sequences  produced an average of  <dig> % repeat hits. while that result coincided with our estimate of approximately 30% repetitive dna in the b. tryoni genome, that figure was only coincidental since the repetitive dna is not well represented in the assembly. similarly, the same comparison between b. tryoni and b. jarvisi also showed that repetitive dna was not preferentially associated with deletions.

we also observed that many transposon sequences in the b. tryoni scaffolds were in homologous positions in both the b. neohumeralis and b. jarvisi contigs. we identified all mariner transposon sequences in the b. tryoni scaffolds, these were fragmented and often contained intervening non-transposon sequences. any other mariner fragments within  <dig>  kb  were considered to be part of the same element. we then extracted the non-transposon sequences flanking each b. tryoni composite element and measured the length of the transposon insertion . the distance between the homologous flanking sequences was then measured in b. neohumeralis or b. jarvisi . this approach is illustrated in figure  <dig>  to assess the significance of any between-species differences, we extracted an equal number of random, paired b. tryoni sequences, with the insert sizes matching the gaps in the actual b. tryoni flanking sequence pairs. the results of this are shown in figure 8a and 8b. for both species pairs, the mean insert size was larger for the mariner sequences than control sequences  and the variances were correspondingly higher. this suggests that mariner sequence insertions are associated with a small increase of intra-species sequence variation. similar comparisons for other repetitive elements are currently underway.figure  <dig>

discussion
the family tephritidae consists of over  <dig> species in over  <dig> genera  <cit> , including major global economic pests  <cit> . many of these species, including the bactrocera, have arisen relatively recently in evolutionary terms  <cit> . tephritids provide numerous promising study systems for speciation, behaviour, invasiveness and sex determination . the present study presents a first set of bactrocera-specific resources that will assist genomic and genetic studies in all these areas. in addition to the first draft of an annotated assembly of the b. tryoni genome, we have produced an extensive non-redundant library of b. tryoni repetitive dna. such a library not only assists annotation but also provides avenues for investigation of genome evolution. we have also delineated the majority of satellite sequences and have provided a complete assembly of the rrna repeat unit, both of which are often lacking from de novo genome assemblies.

the close genetic similarity of b. tryoni and b. neohumeralis has attracted the attention of evolutionary biologists since the 1960s. this study quantified that similarity over the majority of the genome and confirmed previous first-generation sequencing studies of specific nuclear and mitochondrial regions  <cit> . the only differences identified in those earlier studies were two single-nucleotide substitutions and a trinucleotide indel within the ribosomal gene internal transcribed spacer , a level of differentiation more commonly observed between populations than between reproductively isolated species. those differences were confirmed in the present study.

our results have highlighted the potential for speciation studies in the bactrocera genus. the sequence difference between b. tryoni and b. neohumeralis is considerably less than that found between species of drosophila
 <cit> . the closest species pairs are d. pseudoobscura - d. persimilis, a cross which produces sterile males  <cit>  and d. simulans - d. mauritiana. the estimated synonymous substitution rates for these two pairs are around  <dig> %  <cit>  and  <dig> %  <cit> , respectively, compared to our estimate of  <dig> % for b. tryoni and b. neohumeralis. the estimate for b. tryoni and b. neohumeralis is sufficiently low as to be comparable with the extent of variation between strains of d. melanogaster. it is, however, difficult to measure genome-wide polymorphism levels with the currently available data. the b. tryoni strain used for sequencing was established from a mutant individual  <cit>  and subsequently subjected to two further rounds of single-pair inbreeding to reduce polymorphism and facilitate assembly. the b. neohumeralis strain was not systematically inbred, but its establishment and maintenance as a laboratory strain for several years may have contributed to a loss of variability. questions about the extent of polymorphism within and between the two species can only properly be answered by sequencing unrelated individuals from wild populations.

the close similarity between b. tryoni and b. neohumeralis is consistent with the fact that, despite the complete absence of wild hybrids  <cit> , hybrids between the two species are viable and fertile, with only marginal reductions in fitness  <cit> . somewhat surprisingly, laboratory hybrids between b. jarvisi and b. tryoni are also viable and fertile, despite the much greater genetic distance between the two . in this case, the fertility of male hybrids is only slightly reduced  and the sex ratio of hybrid crosses in both directions is slightly biased. crosses between b. jarvisi and b. tryoni may produce up to 70% females in some crosses . viable and fertile hybrids can also be produced by forced mating between b. neohumeralis and b. jarvisi . the potential use of hybrids, together with the genome information, provides a powerful system for investigating the genetic basis for all identifiable phenotypic differences between the three species, including mating-time differences and morphological divergence. the degree of genetic similarity between b. tryoni and b. neohumeralis is unprecedented amongst the closely-related dipteran species studied to date, thereby providing a model for investigating the earliest stages of speciation. this is a field in which good study systems are extremely rare .

we also point the way to overcoming the problem of diagnosis: in the past, the similarity between b. tryoni and b. neohumeralis prevented the development of diagnostic genetic markers for use in hybridisation studies and quarantine testing. here, we present over  <dig> small indels that, subject to studies in outbred wild populations, could provide the basis for new genetic markers. these deletions are currently being investigated as a basis for a simple pcr-based test to allow quarantine authorities to differentiate b. tryoni and b. neohumeralis .

the methods we have used can be applied to any of the closely-related species groups which are challenging for traditional morphological taxonomy . our method requires only a single assembled reference genome for comparison with raw sequencing reads from sibling species.

CONCLUSIONS
this paper presents a comprehensive first draft genome of an important horticultural pest, the queensland fruit fly or q-fly, b. tryoni. although endemic to australia, b. tryoni is an insect pest of worldwide concern, particularly in these times of burgeoning movement of people and produce. further, it represents the first annotated and published genome of a species in the genus bactrocera, which contains the great bulk of tephritid pests in asia and oceania. our data provides an important basis for comparison with the genome of c. capitata and with other tephritid genome projects, for functions related to host-fruit recognition, invasive potential and developmental regulation. our data will also have direct application to the delineation of recent radiations such as the b. dorsalis species complex found in pacific and south-east asian countries  <cit> .

the b. tryoni genome has also enabled analysis of the genomes of two related bactrocera species, b. neohumeralis and b. jarvisi. these are of interest because they are clearly distinct species with different behaviours leading to strong pre-mating isolation. yet, since hybrids between these species are fertile, they present an unusually powerful model for investigating the genetic bases of morphological development, the evolution of morphological change and the molecular aspects of pest status and behaviour.
