BACKGROUND

phytophthora is a genus of plant-pathogenic oomycetes responsible for economically important losses in crops worldwide, as well as damage to natural ecosystems  <cit> . phytophthora infestans is the causal agent of tomato and potato late blight in temperate climates and contributed to major crop losses during the great irish famine  <cit> . phytophthora palmivora, a tropical relative of p. infestans originating from southeastern asia  <cit>  but now present worldwide due to international trade  <cit> , causes root, bud and fruit rotting diseases in many important tropical crops such as papaya, cocoa, oil palm, black pepper, rubber, coconut, durian, mango, cassava and citrus . in addition, p. palmivora infects the roots and leaves of several model plant species such as medicago truncatula  <cit> , hordeum vulgare  <cit>  and arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . despite its economic impact and widespread distribution, nothing is known about the molecular basis underlying its ability to infect its host species and the root responses associated with an infection.


p. palmivora has a hemibiotrophic lifestyle. similar to other phytophthora species, its asexual life cycle in plants is characterised by adhesion of mobile zoospores to the host tissue, encystment and germ tube formation  <cit> . entry into the plant is achieved via surface appressoria and is followed by establishment of an apoplastic hyphal network. during this biotrophic stage, p. palmivora projects haustoria into plant cells. these contribute to acquisition of nutrients and release virulence proteins known as effectors  <cit> . this is followed by a necrotrophic stage characterised by host tissue necrosis and the production of numerous sporangia which release zoospores  <cit> .

sequencing of phytophthora genomes and transcriptomes has revealed repertoires of effector proteins that counteract plant defenses and reprogram the host in support of infection. secretome predictions and subsequent evolutionary and functional studies have helped us to understand how these pathogens cause diseases  <cit> . oomycete effectors are secreted into the apoplast of infected plants. some of them act inside plant cells, and conserved rxlr or lflak amino acid motifs in their n-terminal parts have been associated with their translocation from the microbe into the host cell  <cit> . the lflak motif is present in crinkler  effectors, named after a crinkling and necrosis phenotype caused by some crn proteins when expressed in plants  <cit> . rxlr effectors are usually short proteins with little similarity to conserved functional domains in their c termini. they localise to diverse subcellular compartments and associate with plant target proteins with key roles during infection  <cit> .

recent studies on bacterial and oomycete plant pathogens identified subsets of effectors that are conserved amongst a large number of strains. these so-called core effectors are responsible for a substantial contribution to virulence and thus cannot be mutated or lost by the pathogen without a significant decrease in virulence  <cit> . thus, core effectors constitute highly valuable targets for identification of resistant germplasm and subsequent breeding of disease-resistant crops . to date, the occurrence of such core effectors in oomycetes has largely been reported from plant pathogens with a narrow economical host range such as hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis, phytophthora sojae  <cit>  and p. infestans  <cit> .

plants have evolved a cell-autonomous surveillance system to defend themselves against invading microbes  <cit> . surface-exposed pattern recognition receptors  recognise conserved microbe-associated molecular patterns  released during infection, such as the phytophthora transglutaminase peptide pep- <dig>  <cit> . plants are also able to recognise self-derived damage-associated molecular patterns . these include intracellular peptides that are released in the apoplast upon wounding, such as systemins  <cit>  and secreted plant peptide precursors with damp features that are processed in the apoplast . pathogen recognition initiates basal defense responses which include activation of structural and biochemical barriers, known as mamp-triggered immunity   <cit> . plant pathogens are able to overcome mti by secreting effectors that suppress or compromise mti responses, thereby facilitating effector-triggered susceptibility . in response, plants have evolved disease resistance proteins to detect pathogen effectors or effector-mediated modification of host processes, leading to effector-triggered immunity   <cit> . phytophthora genes encoding effectors which trigger a resistance response in host plants carrying the cognate disease resistance gene are often termed avirulence  genes. cross-species transfer of prrs and disease resistance genes against conserved mamps or avr proteins has been successfully employed to engineer resistant crops  <cit> .

host cell responses to oomycete infections have mainly been studied in aboveground tissues and notably involve subcellular rearrangements of the infected cells, including remodelling of the cytoskeleton  <cit>  and focal accumulation of secretory vesicles  <cit> , which contribute to defense by delivering antimicrobial compounds to the extrahaustorial matrix  <cit> . endocytic vesicles accumulate around oomycete haustoria  <cit> , and the plant-specific small gtpase rab <dig> is recruited at the extrahaustorial membrane during arabidopsis infection by obligate biotrophs  <cit> . several oomycete effectors target different stages of the host secretory pathway. in the apoplast, pathogen-secreted inhibitors have been associated with defense suppression. for instance, the apoplastic effector gip <dig> from p. sojae inhibits the soybean endoglucanase egasea  <cit> . the p. infestans kazal-like protease inhibitors epi <dig>  <cit>  and epi <dig>  <cit>  inhibit the solanum lycopersicum defense protease p69b. the cystatin-like protease inhibitors epic <dig> and epic2b inhibit the cysteine proteases pip <dig>   <cit>  and rcr <dig>  <cit>  as well as the papain-like protease c <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, expression of the p. infestans rxlr effector avrblb <dig> in plant cells prevents c <dig> protease secretion and causes an accumulation of protease-loaded secretory vesicles around haustoria  <cit> .

in this study, we employ the model plant nicotiana benthamiana  <cit>  to study root infection by p. palmivora. dual transcriptomics and de novo assembly of the p. palmivora transcriptome allowed us to define pathogen and plant genes expressed during the interaction. we identified major shifts in pathogen gene expression dynamics associated with lifestyle changes which, interestingly, are not mirrored by dramatic shifts in plant gene expression patterns. de novo transcriptome assembly coupled with semi-automatic secretome prediction and annotation allowed us to identify a set of more than  <dig> secreted phytophthora proteins. this approach enabled discovery of an abundant class of potential novel effectors carrying a conserved peptide motif  and also allowed us to pinpoint key effectors’ contribution to the p. palmivora infection strategy. we characterised two conserved rxlr effectors, rex <dig> and rex <dig>  that promote root infection upon expression in plants. we furthermore show that rex <dig> was able to interfere with host secretion. by studying host transcriptional changes upon infection, we identified a gene encoding a secreted peptide precursor with potential damp motifs whose promoter was specifically activated at root tip infection sites. hence, our work establishes a major resource for root-pathogen interactions, showcases examples of how to exploit these data and provides inroads for effector-aided resistance breeding in tropical crops.

RESULTS
phytophthora palmivora exerts a hemibiotrophic lifestyle in nicotiana benthamiana roots
to describe the infection development of the root pathogen p. palmivora, we investigated the infection dynamics of hydroponically grown n. benthamiana plants root-inoculated with p. palmivora lili-ykdel  <cit>  zoospores . disease development was classified into different symptom extent stages  which allowed us to follow the systemic spread of the infection from roots to shoots . the plants looked healthy for up to 3 days . disease progression in the aerial parts then resulted in a shrunken, brown hypocotyl and wilting of the oldest leaves . this was rapidly followed by brown coloration and tissue shrinkage of the stem  up to the apex . infected plants eventually died within  <dig> to 10 days , indicating that n. benthamiana is susceptible to root infection by p. palmivora .fig.  <dig>

we next characterised the p. palmivora-n. benthamiana interaction on the microscopic level using the fluorescently labelled isolate lili-ykdel . infection events were observed at 3 h after inoculation . zoospores were primarily attracted to root tips, where they encysted and germinated. appressoria were differentiated at this stage and, when infection of the first cell had already occurred, an infection vesicle and subjacent nascent hyphae were also observed . haustoria were visible from 6– <dig> hai, indicative of biotrophic growth . at  <dig> hai, p. palmivora hyphae grew parallel to the cell files in the root cortex, forming a clear colonisation front between infected and non-infected tissues. in addition, extraradical hyphal growth was observed near the root tip . first sporangia occurred at  <dig> hai . consistent with the symptoms observed on aerial parts, hypocotyl colonisation occurred between  <dig> hai and  <dig> hai . finally, the presence of empty or germinating sporangia at  <dig> hai suggests possible secondary infections . therefore, the p. palmivora asexual life cycle completes within  <dig> hai in n. benthamiana roots.

we supported our microscopic studies with biomass quantification based on transcript levels of the p. palmivora 40s ribosomal protein s3a  . we further characterised the different stages observed microscopically by quantifying expression of the p. infestans orthologs of hmp <dig>   <cit>   and the cell-cycle regulator cdc <dig>  <cit>  . hmp <dig> transcripts peaked between  <dig> hai and  <dig> hai and then decreased at later stages. by contrast, cdc <dig> transcripts increased at late time points . taken together, these results further support the conclusion that p. palmivora exerts a hemibiotrophic lifestyle in n. benthamiana roots.

de novo assembly of p. palmivora transcriptome from mixed samples
we performed dual sequencing permitting de novo assembly of a p. palmivora transcriptome as well as an assessment of transcriptional changes in both host and pathogen over time. we extracted rna from infected and uninfected n. benthamiana roots at six time points matching the key steps of the interaction identified by microscopy:  <dig> hai,  <dig> hai,  <dig> hai,  <dig> hai,  <dig> hai and  <dig> hai and an axenically grown p. palmivora sample containing mycelia and zoospores . using illumina hiseq  <dig> paired-end sequencing, we obtained a relatively uniform read depth of 50–60 m reads per sample . to cover all possible transcripts, we reconstructed the p. palmivora transcriptome de novo
, combining ex planta and in planta root samples as well as 76-nt illumina paired-end reads from infected n. benthamiana leaf samples .fig.  <dig> overview of p. palmivora sequencing data analysis workflows. a selection of p. palmivora reads from mixed samples and de novo assembly of transcriptome. b secretome prediction. c pipeline for automated secretome annotation. final products of each pipeline are highlighted by bold lines. sp signal peptide, nls nuclear localisation signal, crn crinkler




following standard adapter trimming and read quality control, we applied a two-step filtering procedure  to separate pathogen reads from plant host reads. first we mapped the pooled read dataset to the n. benthamiana reference genome and collected unmapped read pairs. recovered reads were subsequently mapped to the n. benthamiana transcriptome  <cit> . reads not mapped to either host plant genome or transcriptome were used to run assemblies. short reads  were filtered out to produce transcripts of better quality and coherence. final de novo trinity assemblies were run from 190 m pre-processed, properly paired and cleaned reads . this yielded  <dig>  ‘trinity genes’ corresponding to  <dig>  transcripts with an average backwards alignment rate of 76%, indicative of an overall acceptable representation of reads and therefore reasonably good assembly quality  <cit> . a total of  <dig> trinity genes  were removed by additional checks for residual plant contamination, resulting in a final p. palmivora transcriptome of  <dig>  trinity genes corresponding to  <dig>  transcripts . we further selected  <dig>  trinity genes  having the best expression support .table  <dig>

busco benchmarking universal single-copy orthologues




we assessed completeness of p. palmivora assembly by benchmarking nearly universal single-copy orthologues   <cit>   and compared them to the busco content of p. infestans, p. sojae and p. parasitica transcriptomes. we identified  <dig> busco genes  in our p. palmivora assembly,  <dig>  in p. infestans,  <dig>  in p. sojae and  <dig>  in p. parasitica . we also surveyed  <dig> publicly available phytophthora genomes, yielding  <dig> additional busco genes absent from all transcriptomes. interestingly, the remaining  <dig> busco genes were consistently missing from all analysed phytophthora genomes and transcriptomes . these results suggest that our p. palmivora  transcriptome assembly actually contained 87% of busco genes occurring in phytophthora. hence, our assembly shows acceptable quality and integrity and can be used as a reference for further studies.

clustering of plant and pathogen samples reflects different temporal dynamics during infection
to explore the temporal expression dynamics of plant and pathogen genes, we separately mapped initial reads back to the reference n. benthamiana transcriptome  as well as to our p. palmivora transcriptome assembly . principal component analysis  of plant samples revealed a major difference between infected and uninfected samples . plant transcript profiles from infected samples could be further assigned into three groups:  <dig> hai, 18–24– <dig> hai and 48– <dig> hai . conversely, pca analysis of p. palmivora transcript profiles identified two groups corresponding to early infection  and late infection with mz , while  <dig> hai was kept apart . taken together, these results suggest different behaviour of plant and pathogen transcript profiles at the same times post-infection.fig.  <dig> 
n. benthamiana and p. palmivora transcriptomes show different temporal dynamics during interaction. a, b pca clustering of full transcriptional profiles of n. benthamiana  and p. palmivora . c, d venn diagrams show shared genes expressed in groups identified by pca analysis for n. benthamiana  and p. palmivora . genes with transcripts per million  ≥ <dig> were considered to be expressed. e, f hierarchical clustering of major classes of differentially expressed genes  ≥ 2) in n. benthamiana  and p. palmivora  transcriptomes. relative expression levels of each transcript  in each sample  are shown. tpms were log2-transformed and then median-centred by transcript. plant samples were centred according to the full set of mock and infected samples; only infected samples are shown. mz axenically grown mycelium with sporangia




we identified  <dig> plant and  <dig> pathogen differentially expressed genes  by performing differential expression analysis  ≥ <dig>  false discovery rate  p <10-3) on all possible sample pairs . hierarchical clustering revealed  <dig> p. palmivora genes upregulated exclusively during biotrophy , while all other stages shared sets of induced and expressed genes . interestingly, major shifts in expression patterns occurred at  <dig> hai. taken together with pca grouping, this result suggests that  <dig> hai represents a transition stage from a biotrophic to a necrotrophic lifestyle.

in contrast to the pathogen, the plant transcriptome did not undergo sharp transitions over time and was instead characterised by steady up- or downregulation . therefore, we utilised repeated upregulation of a gene in at least two time points as a selective criterion to alleviate the absence of replicates resulting in  <dig> up- and  <dig> downregulated genes. from these we validated  <dig> out of  <dig> genes with low or no expression under control conditions and high expression levels during infection using qrt-pcr . gene ontology  term analysis revealed that upregulated genes are enriched in biological processes related to hormone metabolism, abiotic stress , defense, biosynthesis, transport, regulation of transcription and protein modification by phosphorylation and ubiquitination . notably, we detected upregulation of numerous ethylene-responsive transcription factors , indicating reprogramming of stress-specific defense regulation. representatives of significantly enriched go categories relevant for defense response include genes encoding endopeptidase inhibitors, such as kunitz-type trypsin inhibitors. we also found upregulation of  <dig> genes encoding o-glycosyl hydrolases. in addition, we detected upregulation of trehalose biosynthesis pathway genes. conversely, downregulated genes showed overall enrichment in biological processes associated with photosynthesis, cellulose biosynthesis and cell division. taken together, these results suggest that infected n. benthamiana roots undergo major transcriptional and post-translational reprogramming leading to an overall activation of stress and defense responses.

p. palmivora secretome prediction and annotation identify a set of effector candidate genes
pathogen-secreted effectors and hydrolytic enzymes are hallmarks of phytophthora infection  <cit> . therefore, we probed our p. palmivora transcriptome for transcripts encoding secreted proteins. a transdecoder-based search for candidate open reading frames   <cit>  identified  <dig>  orfs from predicted trinity genes . we then analysed the predicted orfs using an automated pipeline for secretome prediction  building on existing tools . the pipeline was designed to predict signal peptides and cellular localisation with thresholds specific for oomycete sequences  <cit>  and to exclude proteins with internal transmembrane domains and/or an endoplasmic reticulum  retention signal. we identified  <dig> orfs encoding putative secreted proteins.

partial translated orfs which were not predicted as secreted were subjected to an additional analysis   and resubmitted to the secretome prediction pipeline. this improved procedure allowed us to rescue  <dig> additional orfs encoding putative secreted proteins. in total, we identified  <dig> orfs encoding putative secreted p. palmivora proteins. we further selected a single representative secreted orf for genes with sufficient expression support  ≥ <dig> in three or more samples). this yielded  <dig> p. palmivora genes encoding putative secreted proteins .

to maximise functional annotation of the p. palmivora secretome, we used an integrative approach  tailored to the use of known short motifs characteristic of oomycete secreted proteins. the pipeline contains three major blocks. the first block integrated all the sequence information, with assignment to  <dig> non-redundant genes encoding secreted proteins as well as expression data. the second block combined results of homology searches, for both full-length alignments  and individual functional domains . the third block was designed to survey for known oomycete motifs and domains  for effectors in general). the pipeline produced an initial secretome annotation  which was then manually curated to avoid conflicting annotations. this strategy allowed us to assign a functional category to  <dig> predicted secreted proteins  .table  <dig> representation of classes of putative extracellular proteins in p. palmivora secretome

amongst predicted cytoplasmic effectors, the most prominent category encompasses  <dig> rxlr effectors. of these  <dig> have a conserved rxlr motif followed by a deer motif. wy domains were found in  <dig> rxlr-eer effectors and  <dig> rxlr effectors. some rxlr effectors are unusually long , suggesting that multiple effector domains are linked together. for instance, the effector domain of pltg_ <dig> consisted of  <dig> internal repeats of a wy domain. it remains to be tested whether multiple wy domains within one effector fulfil different and independent roles.

pfam searches revealed one full-length rxlr effector protein  carrying a c-terminal nudix domain. pfam predictions assigned to partial genes identified two putative effectors, one bearing a nudix domain pf <dig>  and the other a myb/sant domain pf <dig> .

sequence similarity searches for rxlr effectors matching known oomycete avirulence proteins revealed pltg_ <dig> as being similar to p. infestans avr3a  . notably, p. palmivora avr3a  harbours the k80/i <dig> configuration, but combined with a terminal valine instead of a tyrosine in piavr3a  <cit> . it thus remains to be tested whether pltg_ <dig> is capable of triggering an r3a-mediated hypersensitive response.

our pipeline only identified  <dig> genes encoding putative crn effectors . crinklers often lack predictable signal peptides but instead might be translocated into plant cells by an alternative mechanism  <cit> . an independent survey using hidden markov model  prediction without prior signal peptide prediction revealed a total of  <dig> crn motif-containing proteins. notably, the putative crn effector pltg_ <dig> carries a c-terminal serine/threonine kinase domain  and shows low sequence similarity  to p. infestans effector crn <dig>  <cit> .

the p. palmivora secretome also contained a substantial number of apoplastic effectors . we identified  <dig> genes encoding extracellular protease inhibitors, including extracellular serine protease inhibitors  with up to five recognisable kazal domains, several cystatins and cysteine protease inhibitors  . pltg_ <dig> encodes a cathepsin protease inhibitor domain followed by a cysteine protease and an ml domain . we also identified  <dig> proteins with small cysteine-rich  signatures,  <dig> of them being encoded in full-length orfs, but only  <dig> in which the mature peptide is shorter than  <dig> aa. longer scrs can harbour tandem arrangements . in one case an scr is linked to an n-terminal pan/apple domain, which is common for carbohydrate-binding proteins  <cit> .

additionally the p. palmivora secretome contains  <dig> proteins carrying potential mamps, including necrosis-inducing proteins , elicitins and lectins. out of  <dig> nlps,  <dig>  carry a pattern of  <dig> amino acid residues which is similar to the immunogenic nlp <dig> motif   <cit> . transcripts encoding elicitins and elicitors in the p. palmivora secretome belong to the group of highest expressed ones during infection . we identified six transglutaminases, five of them  carrying a conserved pep- <dig> motif  <cit> .

despite the annotation efforts, 62% of the genes of the predicted secretome remained hypothetical and may contain novel classes of secreted proteins contributing to p. palmivora virulence. inspection of the second largest tribe after rxlr effectors revealed  <dig> genes, all encoding a conserved n-terminal domain with similarity to the pthr <dig> family combined with variable c-terminal domains. motif enrichment analysis identified an invariant motif hxgpcexxxdd, encoded in the n-terminal domain of all full-length transcripts . homology modelling revealed structural similarity to lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases   <cit> . however, a function for these proteins remains to be assigned. given that their expression peaks during biotrophy  and their conservation in  <dig> oomycete species , they may represent a major class of apoplastic oomycete proteins.

taken together, de novo transcriptome assembly followed by multistep prediction of orf encoding potentially secreted proteins and a semi-automated annotation procedure allowed us to identify all major classes of effectors characteristic to oomycetes as well as p. palmivora-specific effectors with previously unreported domain arrangements. our data suggest that p. palmivora’s infection strategy relies on a diverse set of extracellular proteins, many of which do not match to previously characterised effectors.

most differentially expressed secreted proteins have their highest expression during biotrophy
in order to highlight dynamic expression changes of p. palmivora genes during infection, we performed fuzzy clustering of p. palmivora degs  to lower sensitivity to noisy expression signals and to distinguish between expression profiles, even if they partially overlapped  <cit> . we identified  <dig> expression clusters falling into four main groups according to their temporal expression level maximum . group a was composed of two clusters containing genes downregulated during infection. by contrast, expression levels of genes from group b peaked during biotrophy . group c was composed of two clusters of genes for which transcripts accumulated mostly at  <dig> hai, while group d was formed of four clusters of genes with maximum expression during necrotrophy . group b showed an overall enrichment in all classes of genes encoding secreted proteins , while groups a and c were enriched in elicitin-encoding genes. scrs were enriched in group d. also in group d and characterised by strong transcriptional induction was a gene  encoding several repetitions of an unknown phytophthora-specific amino acid motif. expression dynamics of  <dig> p. palmivora genes from different clusters were validated by qrt-pcr. fourteen genes displayed expression patterns consistent with the results of in silico prediction . taken together, these results suggest that p. palmivora transcriptome dynamics reflect the main lifestyle transitions observed by microscopic analysis of the infection process, and that a major upregulation of secreted proteins occurs during biotrophy in agreement with the occurrence of haustoria, which are a major site for pathogen secretion  <cit> .fig.  <dig> temporal dynamics of p. palmivora differentially expressed genes  during infection time course. fuzzy clustering was performed on p. palmivora degs. only genes with cluster membership values ≥ <dig>  are shown, i.e. alpha cores . functional distribution of secreted proteins for the grouped clusters is shown in . rxlr rxlr-effector, scr small cysteine-rich protein, cwde cell wall-degrading enzyme, nlp necrosis inducing protein, epi protease inhibitor, other other genes encoding proteins predicted to be secreted without specific functional category assigned




conserved rxlr effectors amongst p. palmivora isolates confer enhanced plant susceptibility to root infection
we next focussed on the characterisation of four rxlr effectors upregulated during infection  and named them rex <dig> , rex <dig> , rex <dig>  and rex <dig> . rex1– <dig> sequences from p. palmivora isolates with diverse geographic and host species origin  were obtained by pcr and amplicon sequencing. primers specific for rex1– <dig> generated amplicons from at least  <dig> of the  <dig> isolates  encoding proteins with high levels of amino acid sequence conservation. in particular, rex <dig> and rex <dig> were almost invariant, with one and two amino acid substitutions, respectively .

n-terminal translational green fluorescent protein  fusions of flag-tagged rex coding sequences  expressed in roots of stable transgenic n. benthamiana plants  or transiently in the leaf epidermis  showed nuclear and cytoplasmic fluorescence at  <dig> hai originating from expression of full-length gfp:flag-rex <dig>   <dig> and rex <dig> protein fusions . in contrast to the other three, gfp:flag-rex <dig> fluorescence signals were much weaker in the leaf epidermis nucleus compared to the cytoplasmic signals and absent from root nuclei .fig.  <dig> spatial distribution of rex effectors in n. benthamiana roots. a–d transgenic n. benthamiana plants expressing gfp:flag-rex fusion proteins were regenerated from leaf explants and grown to seeds. subcellular localisation of gfp:flag-rex1– <dig> was assessed on seedling roots stained with propidium iodide . gfp:flag-rex <dig> , gfp:flag-rex <dig>  and gfp:flag-rex <dig>  accumulated in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. gfp:flag-rex <dig>  was detected in the cytoplasm but was excluded from the nucleus. scale bar is 10 μm




to determine the contribution of rex1– <dig> to n. benthamiana root infection, we then challenged hydroponically grown transgenic plants expressing gfp:flag-rex1– <dig> or gfp16c-expressing plants  with p. palmivora zoospores  and monitored disease progression into aerial tissues over time using a disease index ranking from  <dig> to  <dig> derived from the symptoms previously reported . transgenic plants expressing gfp:flag fusions of the highly conserved rex <dig> and rex <dig> effectors displayed significantly accelerated disease symptom development  compared to gfp16c control plants, while expression of gfp:flag-rex <dig> and gfp:flag-rex <dig> did not enhance susceptibility  .fig.  <dig> rex <dig> and rex <dig> increase n. benthamiana susceptibility to p. palmivora, and rex <dig> interferes with host secretion. transgenic n. benthamiana plants expressing gfp16c  or gfp:flag-rex <dig> to gfp:flag-rex <dig> were challenged with zoospores from p. palmivora ykdel, and disease progression was ranked over time using the previously defined symptom extent stages . a representative disease progression curves for transgenic plants expressing gfp:flag-rex <dig> , gfp:flag-rex <dig> , gfp:flag-rex <dig>  or gfp:flag-rex <dig>  compared to gfp16c control plants . p values were determined based on scheirer-ray-hare nonparametric two-way analysis of variance  for ranked data. the experiment was carried out in duplicate . b representative pictures of infected plants, 8 days after infection. c disease-promoting effectors rex <dig> and rex <dig> were co-expressed with a secreted gfp construct  in n. benthamiana leaves. gfp fluorescence was quantified along the nucleus




rex <dig> impairs plant secretion processes
suppression of defense component secretion has previously been found to be targeted by at least two mechanisms  <cit> . we thus investigated the ability of the infection-promoting rex <dig> and rex <dig> effectors to suppress host secretion . we generated ptrafficlights, a vector which enables expression of a secreted gfp  together with a nuclear-cytoplasmic dsred from the same a. tumefaciens transfer dna  and performed a. tumefaciens-mediated transient expression assays in n. benthamiana leaves using the same conditions as those of bartetzko and co-workers  <cit> . under control conditions, sppr1-gfp is secreted to compartments with acidic ph, preventing it from fluorescing, and we observed only a faint signal from the perinuclear endomembrane compartments . the gfp fluorescence signal intensity and distribution were altered by treatment with the secretion pathway inhibitor brefeldin a ; this resulted in the formation of gfp-positive bfa bodies . co-expression of sppr1-gfp with flag-rex <dig> did not affect gfp levels, while flag-rex <dig> enhanced gfp levels in perinuclear endomembrane compartments and resulted in a strong labelling of the cortical er . the ability of rex <dig> to retain gfp in endomembrane compartments suggest that this effector may promote infection by interfering with host secretion pathways.

the tiptop promoter is activated at root tip infection sites
when screening our data for plant promoters responding early to p. palmivora attack. we found niben101scf03747g <dig>  encoding a small secreted protein containing two repeats of a conserved sgps-gxgh motif known from pathogen-associated molecular pattern -induced peptides   <cit>  to be one of the most strongly induced plant genes. to study the spatial distribution of its promoter activity, we generated transgenic n. benthamiana plants expressing a promoter-gfp:uida reporter fusion and challenged them with p. palmivora lili-td  <cit>  expressing a red fluorescent protein. consistent with the transcriptomic data, histochemical beta-glucuronidase  staining revealed a localised gus signal at the tip of infected roots  only where zoospores had accumulated but not in uninfected roots. we therefore termed the gene tiptop . tiptop promoter activation is correlated with p. palmivora infection . p. palmivora-triggered tiptop promoter activation was strongest adjacent to invasive hyphae as revealed by gfp confocal fluorescence microscopy . in addition, the tiptop promoter was not activated by abiotic stresses  and wounding, but weak activation was observed in root tips in response to flagellin  treatment . plantpan  <dig>  <cit>  analysis of the tiptop promoter sequence identified various transcription factor binding motifs . taken together, these results suggest that tiptop is a root tip-specific p. palmivora-induced promoter.fig.  <dig> the promoter of a gene encoding the secreted peptide tiptop is upregulated during early biotrophy in n. benthamiana roots. a representative pictures of beta-glucuronidase -stained whole root systems of n. benthamiana transgenics carrying tiptoppro::gfp:gus, non-infected or 16 h after infection with p. palmivora lili-tdtomato. stars represent unstained root tips. arrowheads represent stained root tips. b representative pictures of infected root tips after gus staining, showing gus signal at the vicinity of infection sites . uninfected root tips from the same plant do not show any staining . scale bar is 25 μm. c representative pictures of gfp signal at the root tip of infected n. benthamiana transgenics expressing gfp:gus fusion under the control of tiptop promoter




discussion
we utilised a dual transcriptomics approach coupled to a semi-automatic secretome annotation pipeline to study the interaction between p. palmivora and n. benthamiana roots. while the pathogen transcriptome undergoes remarkable shifts in expression patterns throughout the infection, we see a steady response of the plant transcriptome with no detectable major shifts in sets of differentially expressed genes. we used our dataset to identify p. palmivora and n. benthamiana genes implicated in the interaction, uncovered a new class of hxgpce effector candidates and characterised two conserved biotrophic p. palmivora effector proteins which confer enhanced infection susceptibility when expressed in planta. we show that one of them, rex <dig>  suppresses plant secretion processes. surveying the set of early transcriptionally activated plant genes resulted in the identification of an n. benthamiana gene that is specifically induced at infected root tips and encodes a peptide with danger-associated molecular features.

dual transcriptomics and de novo assembly enable functional studies of unsequenced genomes
dual transcriptomics captures simultaneous changes in host and pathogen transcriptomes  <cit>  when physical separation of two interacting organisms is unfeasible. the diversity of plant pathogens often results in the absence of microbial reference genomes. this is particularly relevant for obligate biotrophic plant pathogens, which cannot be cultivated separately from their host. our established viable alternative, a de novo assembly of a plant pathogen transcriptome from separated mixed reads followed by a semi-automated annotation, is thus applicable to a broader community. taking advantage of the availability of the host reference genome, we separated p. palmivora reads from the mixed samples and combined them with reads from the ex planta samples to create a single de novo assembly for the pathogen transcriptome.

assembly completeness in terms of gene content might be assessed based on evolutionary expectations, so that recovery of conserved genes serves as a proxy measure for the overall completeness . our p. palmivora de novo assembly had sufficient read support , so we further probed it for the presence of buscos. since there is no specific oomycete set, we checked presence of  <dig> eukaryotic busco genes and found  <dig> of them . lack of some busco genes in our assembly might result from the fact that originally busco sets were developed to estimate completeness of genomic assemblies and did not require expression evidence  <cit> . to verify this, we extended the same completeness analysis to existing phytophthora genomes and transcriptomes and found that transcriptomes in general indeed contained fewer buscos. moreover, we found  <dig> eukaryotic busco genes consistently missing from phytophthora genomic assemblies. therefore, a busco-based completeness test for transcriptomes should be applied with caution within the phytophthora genus, considering adjustments for expression support and the uneven distribution of eukaryotic single-copy orthologues. we propose that, with an ever-growing body of oomycete genomic and transcriptomic data, a specific set of benchmarking orthologues needs to be created to support de novo assemblies and facilitate studies of these economically relevant non-model plant pathogens  <cit> .

so far, dual transcriptomics has only been used with limited time resolution and sequencing depth in plant-pathogenic oomycete studies  <cit> . our study encompasses the full range of p. palmivora sequential lifestyle transitions occurring in n. benthamiana root, allowing reconstruction of a comprehensive transcriptional landscape in both interacting organisms. we found three major waves of p. palmivora gene expression peaks that correlate with its major lifestyle transitions:  early infection and biotrophic growth inside host tissues;  switch to necrotrophy;  late necrotrophy and sporulation. similar transcription dynamics following switches of lifestyles were previously described for the hemibiotrophic pathogens colletotrichum higginsianum  <cit> , phytophthora parasitica  <cit>  during arabidopsis root infection and p. sojae upon infection of soybean leaves  <cit> , though the exact timing of infection was different.

interestingly, the n. benthamiana transcriptional response to infection does not mirror the observed significant shifts in infection stage-specific p. palmivora gene expression. instead it is characterised by steady induction and repression. high-resolution transcriptomics were applied to a. thaliana leaves challenged with botrytis cinerea to untangle the successive steps of host response to infection  <cit> . however, in the absence of pathogen expression data, it is not possible to correlate these changes with changes in the pathogen transcriptome. it is likely that pathogen expression patterns are not useable to infer a link to corresponding plant responses.

the response of n. benthamiana roots to p. palmivora is characterised by an upregulation of genes associated with hormone physiology, notably ethylene through activation of ethylene response transcription factors  and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate  synthase. ethylene is involved in n. benthamiana resistance to p. infestans  <cit> . we also observed an induction of two pin-like auxin efflux carriers. suppression of the auxin response was associated with increased a. thaliana susceptibility to p. cinnamomi disease and was stimulated by phosphite-mediated resistance  <cit> . interestingly, phosphite was also required for defense against p. palmivora  <cit> . we found upregulation of chitinases and endopeptidase inhibitors, such as kunitz-type trypsin inhibitors, which are often induced by oomycete and fungal pathogens . induction of genes encoding o-glycosyl hydrolases is associated with cell wall remodeling, while phenylalanine ammonia lyases  contribute to cell wall reinforcement by activation of lignin biosynthesis  <cit> . upregulation of the trehalose biosynthesis pathway is associated with membrane stabilisation  <cit>  and partially mitigates the toxic effects of oxidative stress  <cit> . upregulation of several enzymes of the mevalonate pathway suggests modulation of the biosynthesis of isoprenoids such as defense-associated phytoalexins as well as sterols. in particular, transcriptional repression of genes encoding sterol 4-alpha-methyl-oxidase 2- <dig> and c <dig> sterol desaturases suggests an attenuation of the brassinosteroid synthesis, while repression of genes with homology to sterol methyl transferase  <dig> points to a repression of the beta-sitosterol/stigmasterol branch. conversely, induction of terpenoid synthases/epi-aristolochene synthases points to a selective induction of the sesquiterpenes, which contain defense-associated phytoalexins such as capsidiol  <cit> . finally, the n. benthamiana response to p. palmivora also includes upregulation of genes encoding late embryogenesis abundant  proteins as well as heat shock proteins. lea proteins have been associated with the drought response  <cit> , and upregulation of genes associated with water deprivation upon phytophthora infection has been previously reported  <cit> . conversely, downregulated genes were mostly associated with photosynthesis, cellulose biosynthesis and cell division. these results were consistent with those of previous reports  <cit> .

analysing partial transcripts improved the predicted p. palmivora secretome
to study p. palmivora secreted proteins, we developed a prediction and annotation pipeline tailored for signal peptide prediction based on orfs derived from de novo assembled transcripts. often a six-frame translation is utilised to identify candidate orfs. however, we use a transdecoder approach which enriches for the most likely translated orf by integrating homology-based matches to known pfam domains and phytophthora proteins. compared to six-frame translation, this approach can result in partial orfs, which may lead to a misprediction of translation start sites and therefore of signal peptides. to overcome this, we implemented a refinement step in our secretome prediction pipeline to rescue partial orfs by finding the next likely translation start position and following the secretome prediction steps. this procedure allowed us to rescue an additional  <dig> orfs, including several which likely encode rxlr effectors, elicitins and cell wall-degrading enzymes, thus highlighting the importance of this additional step.

effector-guided resistance breeding potential
we identified two rxlr effectors that show high sequence conservation amongst p. palmivora isolates worldwide, which suggests that they may represent core effectors that cannot be lost or mutated without a fitness cost for the pathogen  <cit> . as such, these effectors constitute valuable candidates to accelerate cloning of disease resistance  genes and effector-assisted deployment of resistance. this strategy has been used against p. infestans  <cit> .

our approach identified a potential avr3a homologue in p. palmivora . the p. infestans avr3aki allele confers avirulence to p. infestans isolates on r3a-expressing potatoes, while the avr3aem allele is not being recognised  <cit> . it will be interesting to study whether potato r3a or engineered r3a derivatives with a broader recognition spectrum  <cit>  can be exploited to generate resistance towards p. palmivora in economically relevant transformable host plants. additionally, p. palmivora proteins also harbour pep-13-type mamp motifs present in four transglutaminases and several nlp20-containing nlps. while the pep- <dig> plant receptor remains to be found, the receptor-like kinase rlp <dig> has recently been identified as an nlp <dig> receptor  <cit>  with the potential to confer resistance even when transferred into other plant species. introduction of rlp <dig> into p. palmivora host plants may thus be another strategy to engineer resistant crops.

the p. palmivora effector rex <dig> inhibits plant secretion pathways
we found that rex <dig> interferes with host secretion, a common strategy of bacterial and oomycete pathogens  <cit> . rerouting of the host late endocytic trafficking to the extrahaustorial membrane  <cit>  and accumulation of the small gtpase rab <dig> around haustoria  <cit>  is well documented. given that rex <dig> is almost invariant in p. palmivora, it is likely that rex <dig> targets components of the secretory pathway which are conserved among diverse host species. of the four functionally tested rxlr effectors, the two most conserved ones  amongst p. palmivora isolates both conferred increased susceptibility. rex <dig> and rex <dig> therefore represent important targets for disease resistance breeding in tropical crops. it is possible that isolate-specific variants of rex <dig> and rex <dig> may provide a colonisation benefit only in hosts other than n. benthamiana.

p. palmivora triggers expression of danger-associated molecular pattern peptides
upon p. palmivora root infection, 2886 n. benthamiana genes were upregulated and  <dig> genes downregulated. compared to previously studied root transcriptomes of responses to broad-host-range phytophthora species  <cit> , our data permitted the identification of early induced genes such as tiptop, a p. palmivora-responsive root tip promoter. an exciting future perspective is its exploitation for induced early resistance against phytophthora root infections. this promoter also provides inroads to dissect early host cell responses to p. palmivora, when employed in combination with a cell sorting approach to generate samples enriched for infected cells.

the tiptop gene encodes a peptide with similarities to damp peptides  <cit> . the occurrence of two tandem repeats of a conserved sgpspgxgh motif in the tiptop protein is reminiscent of the sgps/gxgh motifs of pip and pipl peptides  <cit> , and the closest arabidopsis homologues of tiptop, pip <dig> and pip <dig>  are implied in responses to biotic stress.

hou and co-workers showed that the pip <dig> peptide is induced by pathogen elicitors and amplifies a. thaliana immune response by binding to the receptor-like kinase  <dig>   <cit> . analysis of in silico data showed that pip <dig> and pip <dig> were activated upon a. thaliana infection by botrytis cinerea or p. infestans  <cit> . in contrast to pip <dig> and pip <dig>  the tiptop promoter is inactive under control conditions, suggesting it may undergo a different transcriptional regulation than the previously characterised arabidopsis peptides.

CONCLUSIONS
the use of dual transcriptomics represents a successful approach to identify transcriptionally regulated effectors as well as plant genes implicated in the root infection process. we found conserved mamps and effectors with similarity to known avr proteins such as avr3a which may harbour the potential for disease resistance engineering. we characterised two conserved rxlr effectors conferring enhanced susceptibility to root infection and confirmed interference with host secretion as a p. palmivora pathogenicity mechanism. furthermore, the p. palmivora-inducible tiptop promoter and the pip <dig>  3-like peptide are promising leads for engineering p. palmivora resistance. in summary, our findings provide a rich resource for researchers studying oomycete plant interactions.
