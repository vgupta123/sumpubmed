BACKGROUND
trehalose  is a non-reducing disaccharide that is present in a wide variety of organisms. it has been isolated from plants, fungi, nematodes and insects  <cit> . in fungi, trehalose has been shown to accumulate in dispersal and survival structures such as spores , sclerotia, and in yeast cells going into stationary phase  <cit>  . since the sugar is rapidly degraded when these structures germinate or resume vegetative growth, early research concluded that trehalose serves as a storage molecule  <cit> . however, later studies showed that the function of trehalose is more complex and diverse than just serving as an energy reserve; the molecule has been shown to function as a regulator of carbon metabolism  <cit> , a signaling molecule and a protection molecule against various kinds of abiotic stress  <cit> . several fungal species have been shown to induce trehalose production as a stress response. examples include: saccharomyces cerevisiae <cit> , zygosaccharomyces bailii <cit> , a. nidulans <cit> , a. fumigatus <cit> , rhizopus oryzae <cit> , and botrytis cinerea <cit> . trehalose is known to protect both proteins and lipid membranes of living cells against stressors such as heat, desiccation and cold. although the mode of bio-protection of trehalose is not fully elucidated, three main hypotheses are generally accepted, and the true mechanism is likely a combination of these. the hypotheses include: water replacement ; mechanical entrapment ; preferential exclusion   <cit> . the physico-chemical properties of trehalose that lie behind these hypotheses include several crystalline forms, a high glass transition temperature, and the stereochemistry of the sugar  <cit> .

in fungi, trehalose is synthesized via the intermediate trehalose-6-phosphate  and involves two enzymatic steps. first, t6p is formed from one glucose-6-phosphate and one udp-glucose catalyzed by t6p-synthase . in the next step, the phosphate molecule is removed by trehalose-phosphate-phosphatase  yielding trehalose  <cit> . the organism in which trehalose synthesis has been most thoroughly studied is s. cerevisiae. here, four homologous gene products responsible for trehalose synthesis physically interact forming a “trehalose synthase complex”, which consists of one tps , one tpp , and two other subunits, tsl <dig> and tps <dig>  with proposed regulatory and stabilizing functions  <cit> . in filamentous fungi, the gene products involved in trehalose synthesis are not as thoroughly investigated as in s. cerevisiae, but have been studied with respect to germination  <cit> , plant pathology  <cit>  and human pathology  <cit> .

within aspergilli, several individual gene products have been identified and characterized. in a. niger, two tps <dig> orthologs, tpsa and tpsb, have been identified and characterized. at ambient temperature, the trehalose level of Δtpsa mycelia was lowered compared to wild-type. in contrast to the constitutively expressed tpsa, the expression of tpsb was induced by thermal stress  <cit> . in the opportunistic human pathogen a. fumigatus, four tps <dig> paralogs, tpsa – d have been identified  <cit> . when deleting these genes, the authors found that either tpsa or tpsb was sufficient to maintain normal trehalose levels, but if both genes were deleted, the resulting mutant strain was depleted of trehalose and showed slower germination rates as well as higher susceptibility to heat and oxidative stress compared to wild-type. another notable finding was that this double mutant was hypervirulent in infected mice  <cit> . in a. nidulans, a tps <dig> ortholog, tpsa, has been identified and deleted. in this mutant, trehalose was not accumulated, and in addition, the authors could conclude that in a. nidulans trehalose is important for resistance to continual exposure to sub-lethal stress but not to short exposure of lethal stress  <cit> . in contrast to s. cerevisiae, tps mutants in aspergilli are able to utilize glucose as carbon source  <cit> . all identified tps <dig> orthologs in aspergilli are generally much shorter than the s. cerevisiae tps <dig>  around  <dig> amino acids compared to  <dig> 

besides tps <dig> orthologs, two tps <dig> orthologs have been identified within the aspergilli, one in a. nidulans <cit>  and one in a. fumigatus <cit> : in both species they are designated orla. the Δorla mutant of a. fumigatus had a pronounced phenotype with abolished asexual reproduction as well as decreased virulence. however, the phenotype could be restored to wild-type appearance by growing the mutant on media containing an osmotic stabilizer . as also observed in a. nidulans, the a. fumigatus Δorla mutant strain contained wild-type levels of trehalose but the t6p levels were elevated  <cit> .

in this study we focused on trehalose synthesis in filamentous fungi, and more specifically, in aspergillus niger. this is a common food spoilage mould as well as an industrially important organism, utilized for production of citric acid, for instance  <cit> . six genes, tpsa , tpsb , tpsc , tppa , tppb  and tppc  were identified to be involved in trehalose biosynthesis. expression of these genes was studied during conidial outgrowth. in addition, we deleted these genes and characterized the mutants in terms of trehalose and t6p content, protein interactions, and stress survival coupled to situations often occurring in foodstuff.

low-temperature scanning electron microscopy 
wild-type, n <dig>  and Δtppa were grown for 1 week on amm. margins of colonies containing conidiophores were excised with a surgical blade and carefully transferred into a copper cup . dislodging during snap freezing was prevented by gluing agar blocks in the copper cup with frozen tissue medium . the sample was snap-frozen in nitrogen slurry and immediately transferred in a vacuum transfer device to an oxford ct <dig> cryostation attached to a jeol 5600lv scanning electron microscope . electron micrographs were acquired from uncoated frozen samples, or after sputter-coating with gold three times during 30 s. micrographs of uncoated samples were taken at an acceleration voltage of  <dig>  kv, and consisted of  <dig> averaged fast scans . coated samples were observed at 5 kv using f <dig> scans.

extraction of nucleic acids
dna was extracted as previously described  <cit> . rna from dormant conidia and conidia in early stages of germination  was extracted according to leeuwen and co-workers  <cit> . rna from germinating spores , mycelia and sporulating mycelia  were extracted according to plumridge and co-workers  <cit> . as a final step in both protocols, the rna products were purified using a qiagen rneasy mini kit .

two-hybrid assay
the two-hybrid assay was performed using the bacth system kit . full-length cdna for all six genes were amplified using primers with internal restriction sites . after digestion of the pcr products, the inserts were ligated into linearized and dephosphorylated pkt <dig> and put18c vectors and used to transform e. coli. all ligations in this work were performed with the readytogo ligation kit  and were transformed into neb 10-β competent e. coli cells , unless otherwise stated. correct insertions were confirmed with vector specific primers  followed by sequencing. successful clones were co-transformed into electrocompetent bth <dig> cells and selected on la plates supplemented with ampicillin  and kanamycin . the protein-protein interactions were assayed according to the manufacturer’s protocol with the following modifications. one fresh colony of each interaction was transferred to 100 ml conical flasks with 5 ml lb supplemented with ampicillin 50 μg/ml, kanamycin 50 μg/ml and  <dig>  mm iptg, and incubated with shaking at 100 rpm at 20°c for 72 h. the extent of protein-protein interaction was measured with β-galactosidase assays as units/mg dry weight.

cdna synthesis and real-time pcr
using total rna as template, cdna was synthesized using a polyt primer  and the enzyme superscriptiii  according to the manufacturer’s protocol. quantitative real-time pcr was performed with the biorad cfx- <dig> system using the evagreen reagent , gene specific primers , and the following protocol: initial denaturation and enzyme activation, 95°c 30 s; 40 cycles of 95°c for 2 s and 56-60°c for 8 s; plate read; and finally, melt curve analysis starting at 65°c and ending at 95°c. relative expression for tpsa-c and tppa-c were calculated from and compared to a serially-diluted cdna pool and normalized to the actin-encoding gene , which has been successfully used in previous experiments  <cit>  and is expressed at high levels throughout germination according to published microarray data  <cit> . for each growth stage, the expressions were calculated from four biological replicates, each with three technical replicates. to verify the expression, or lack thereof, in the reconstituted and null mutant of tppb, the expression in mutants was normalized against n <dig> as previously described  <cit>  using the efficiency calibrated mathematical method for the relative expression ratio in real-time pcr  <cit> .

gene deletions and complementation
deletion constructs for the genes, tpsa, tpsb, tppa, tppb and tppc were made using fusion pcr to replace the coding sequence with the a. oryzae pyrg gene, and used to transform the uridine auxotrophic strain ma <dig>   <cit>  as previously described  <cit> . with the same technique, a mutant lacking both tpsb and tppc was created. a second deletion mutant of tppb,  was generated in a different uridine auxotrophic strain, ma <dig>   <cit> . both ma <dig>  and ma <dig>  have deficient kusa that is the a. niger ortholog of kus <dig>  which is required for the non-homologous end-joining pathway  <cit> . the tpsc deletion strain was constructed by cloning tpsc in the standard pbs-sk vector  using bamhi and xhoi. next, the vector was digested with hindiii to remove 1648 bp, containing most of the coding sequence. after dephosphorylation of the vector, a hindiii digested pcr product of the a. oryzae pyrg gene was ligated into the vector, thus replacing tpsc. this deletion construct was pcr-amplified and used to transform strain ma <dig> . all a. niger transformants were confirmed using pcr and sequencing. for the deletion strains where ma <dig>  was used as parent strain, the kusa gene was repaired using induced recombination by repeated transfer to agar plates supplemented with fluoroacetamide  <dig>  μg/ml, as described  <cit> . all primers for gene deletions are listed in table  <dig>  the Δtppb strain was complemented as previously described  <cit> . briefly, the strain was transformed with a plasmid carrying an intact copy of tppb and a cassette carrying hygromycin resistance.

extraction and quantification of trehalose and trehalose-6-phosphate
trehalose from dormant and swollen conidia, germlings and mycelia was extracted and quantified as previously described  <cit> . in brief, harvested fungal material was freeze-dried and homogenized using a mortar. samples were diluted with ultra pure water, boiled, evaporated and derivatized by trimethylsilylanization before injection into the gas chromatograph–mass spectrometer . relative concentrations of α-α-trehalose were calculated as the ratio to an internal standard  and thereafter correlated to a standard curve to obtain the absolute concentrations. all trehalose measurements were performed in biological duplicates based on the average of three technical triplicates.

extraction and quantification of t6p was performed essentially as described by  <cit> . liquid cultures were inoculated with  <dig> spores per ml, incubated at 25°c for 3 days at 140 rpm, and all mycelia from one culture made up one sample. three biological replicates based on the average of three technical replicates were used for all strains.

stress tolerance and long term viability of conidia
dormant conidia from wild-type a. niger, the additional control strain pyrg+, and the deletion mutants Δtppb and Δtppb <dig> were subjected to heat stress for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 120 min at 55°c. dormant conidia of wild-type, pyrg + and Δtppb were subjected to sub-lethal salt and benzoic acid stress by being spread on amm plates containing benzoic acid or nacl at concentrations ranging from non-effective to total growth inhibition of the control strains. for detailed description of these stress experiments see  <cit> . in addition, dormant conidia from control strains and Δtppb were subjected to oxidative stress by adding 200 mm h2o <dig> to freshly made conidial suspensions . the suspensions were incubated for  <dig>   <dig> or 40 min before being spread on amm plates. to test long-term viability, conidial suspensions  were stored at 4°c for a total of 8 weeks. an aliquot of the suspension was withdrawn weekly, diluted and spread on amm plates for enumeration.

plates from all experiments were incubated at 25°c for 3– <dig> days before cfu were estimated, and all experiments were performed at least in triplicates .

RESULTS
identification of genes involved in trehalose synthesis in aspergillus niger and other fungi
known amino acid sequences of the proteins of the trehalose synthesis complex of s. cerevisiae were used as queries to identify homologous genes in the a. niger genome by searching the databases available at ncbi using blastp . we confirmed the presence of two previously characterized tps <dig> orthologs: tpsa  and tpsb . also, we could detect two genes, previously identified by sequence homology  <cit> ; a third tps <dig> paralog, tpsc , and a tps <dig> ortholog, which we call tppa . in addition, we could identify two previously unidentified, putative tppa paralogs designated tppb  and tppc . compared to tppa, these two encoded proteins were of similar length  and had a protein identity of 37%  and 35% , respectively . from the ncbi’s conserved domain database  <cit>  it was revealed that all three tpp proteins contain a phosphate synthase domain approximately  <dig> residues from the n-terminal, and a phosphatase domain approximately  <dig> residues from the n-terminal . the tps proteins only contain the phosphate synthase domain . in summary, three tps <dig> orthologs, tpsa-c, and three tps <dig> orthologs, tppa-c, were identified from the a. niger genome.

the obtained amino acid sequences of tpp and tps proteins were compared to those present in all known genomes of aspergillus species, as well as other fungal species as references. for this, we used blastp at ncbi  and aspnd . all identified fungal genomes contain at least one putative t6p synthase and trehalose-6-phosphate-phosphatases orthologous to tps2/tppa/orla. in addition, tppb could be identified in all filamentous ascomycota, whereas tppc is only present in the aspergillus subgenera fumigati and circumdati. both tppb and tppc group together with the s. cerevisiae tps <dig> and tsl <dig> proteins. the relationships of different gene products in some reference species are displayed as a phylogenetic tree . an additional observation is that, whenever present, tpsb and tppc are located adjacent on the chromosomes. the protein outside the putative trehalose synthase complex that had the highest blast score against tpsa was ani_1_ <dig>  encoding a glutamate carboxypeptidase, where the most similar region consisted of 30% over  <dig> amino acid residues. in contrast, close homologs could be identified in more distantly related species such as the bacterium escherichia coli and the protist dictyostelium discoideum .

two-hybrid assay to reveal putative protein-protein interactions
in order to determine whether the homologous proteins physically interact, as has been reported in s. cerevisiae <cit> , we performed a bacterial-based two-hybrid assay screening for interactions between all six a. niger proteins. for each protein, the full-length open reading frame was cloned into an expression vector and co-transformed into e. coli cells. all  <dig> possible combinations of a. niger proteins were screened, together with two clones containing different subunits of the leucine zipper gcn <dig> serving as a positive control and four combinations of one a. niger protein and one bacterial protein serving as negative controls. results with no interactions were repeated at least once in an additional independent two-hybrid assay. where interactions were detected, the assay was repeated in at least two independent assays. results indicated that tpsb interacts with tpsa, tpsb and tppa, and that all tps units interact with themselves . all putative interactions involving either tppb or tppc did not score any signals above the negative controls .

*estimated values are in units/mg dry weight bacteria. values in parentheses are the highest and lowest scores for each based on three to four independent assays. the positive control zip-zip  was scored to  <dig> . negative controls and remaining protein interactions scored at maximum  <dig>  but usually less than  <dig>  values in bold are considered true protein-protein interactions.

gene expression during conidial outgrowth
gene expressions were quantified during different stages of a. niger development. preliminary results showed that due to the extractability of different structures, two rna extraction protocols  were required: the first included high force to break the tough cell walls of conidia and early germination structures; and, the second was more efficient for fragile structures. notably, the second protocol was not vigorous enough to extract any rna from spores . therefore, the “plate” value in figure  <dig> only represents gene expression in mycelia and conidiation structures, but not mrna present in the produced conidia. cdna was made with the mrna as a template, and the relative expressions of the six putative trehalose synthesis genes, tpsa, tpsb, tpsc, tppa, tppb and tppc, were analyzed with real-time pcr.

the general expression pattern of the genes  was as follows: the expression was highest in still dormant conidia and had decreased by approximately 2-fold after 3 h incubation; after 6 h incubation there was a slight, but not significant, decrease; and, in  <dig> and 72 h mycelium the expression was very low. for tpsb, tppa and tppc, the expression was then up-regulated in sporulating colonies , while it remained low for tpsc and tppb. one gene, tppa, deviated slightly from the described pattern: the decrease in expression after 3 h was not as profound as in the other genes, and a slight, but not significant, up-regulation could be seen in 72 h mycelium.

targeted gene deletions of six aspergillus niger genes
to characterize the function of the six a. niger proteins, tpsa, tpsb, tpsc, tppa, tppb and tppc were all subjected to targeted gene deletions by replacing the gene with the a. oryzae pyrg resistance cassette. a double mutant, lacking the two adjacent genes tpsb and tpsc was also constructed. all deletion mutants were confirmed with pcr using both internal and flanking primers .

with the exception of Δtppa, all deletion mutants showed phenotypes similar to wild-type. when culturing the wild-types and mutants at temperatures ranging from 15°c to 37°c, no strain-dependent differences in growth rates or morphologies could be observed; at 10°c no growth was observed for any strain . the tppa mutant showed a marked reduction in the number of conidia produced compared to the other strains, giving the colonies growing on plate a whitish, and with age, light brownish appearance, compared to the black wild-type . this phenotype was retained during aging, and under all growth conditions. when comparing the spore densities, the wild-type, n <dig>  yielded an average of  <dig>  ×  <dig>  spores/mm <dig>  whereas Δtppa yielded an average of  <dig>  ×  <dig>  spores/mm <dig>  i.e. a 6 × 102-fold reduction. microscopic studies revealed that the conidiophores of Δtppa had a clearly different appearance as is shown in figure 4c and d. most notably, vesicle swelling was almost completely absent and metulae were irregularly positioned . however, the conidia produced showed similar size and ornamentation to wild-type . in contrast to what has been reported in the corresponding mutant of a. fumigatus <cit> , it was not possible to restore wild-type morphology by growing Δtppa on media containing an osmotic stabilizer, i.e. the described phenotype persisted in all growth conditions.

quantification of trehalose-6-phosphate and trehalose in wild-type and mutants
all three tpp genes putatively encode the enzyme trehalose-6-phosphate-phosphatase. to investigate if this enzyme was absent in the tpp deletion strains, the amount of trehalose-6-phosphate  in mycelia from wild-type, Δtppa, Δtppb and Δtppc were analyzed. there were no significant differences in t6p levels between wild-type, Δtppb or Δtppc. in Δtppa, however, t6p was clearly accumulated; the mycelium from this strain contained an average of 124 nmol t6p per gram dry weight compared to 18 nmol in the wild-type .

to elucidate how specific gene products influence the trehalose content of a. niger conidia in different stages of maturation, conidia were harvested from control and mutant strains after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 90 days. in these and the following stress experiments, in addition to the wild-type n <dig> strain, we also included a kusa deficient strain with a repaired pyrg gene, pyrg +  <cit>  as a control with identical genetic background as the tps and tpp deletion mutants. the dormant conidia were extracted and the trehalose levels analyzed and expressed as percentage of conidial dry weight . for Δtppa it was not possible to analyze the trehalose content of 5 day conidia, as insufficient conidia were produced. for the other strains, a significant increase in trehalose was detected between the two first time points tested,  <dig> and 14 days. during further aging of conidia, between  <dig> and 90 days, no significant changes in trehalose levels were detected .

at all time points, conidia from all mutant strains contained significantly less trehalose compared to wild-type conidia . when comparing the deletion mutants to the other control strain, pyrg+, significantly lower levels of trehalose were detected in strains Δtpsa, Δtppa and Δtppb. after 14 days of maturation the conidial trehalose level was 50% lower in Δtpsa compared to pyrg+, and  <dig> and 60% lower in Δtppa and Δtppb, respectively. for Δtpsa and Δtppa, the reduction was significant at all time points tested, and for Δtppb, the difference was significant in  <dig>   <dig> and 90 day old conidia but not after 5 days.

among the deletion mutants with wild-type like phenotypes, i.e. when excluding Δtppa, Δtppb had the lowest overall trehalose content. after 14 days of incubation, the trehalose level was  <dig> % of conidial dry weight compared to  <dig>  and  <dig> % in wild-type n <dig> and pyrg+, respectively. although the conidial trehalose content was consistently lower in Δtppa, the extremely low number of spores produced made this strain unsuitable for studies on conidial survival. therefore, Δtppb was, due to its wild-type morphology, selected for additional studies to reveal whether or not a normal internal trehalose level has any impact on stress survival and growth.

confirmation and further characterization of 
Δtppb

before subjecting the tppb deletion mutant to stress, a few confirmatory experiments were performed to ensure that the lowered trehalose content was a consequence of the deleted gene: a new deletion mutant of tppb, Δtppb <dig>  was generated using ma <dig>  as parent strain, and on a selected transformant the Δkusa gene was restored using acetamide. analysis of trehalose content in 14 day old conidia from this new mutant showed that they were as low as in Δtppb . moreover, the deletions mutants were complemented by transformation of an autonomously replicating plasmid carrying the gene for hygromycin resistance as well as an intact copy of the tppb gene. putative transformants were selected on hygromycin plates. the presence of the construct was confirmed using pcr and plasmid rescue . in a previous study we discovered that, when using this methodology, only a fraction of conidia carry the plasmid  <cit> . this was also valid for tppb + conidia, where only a few percent germinated on hygromycin media . therefore, the mycelial trehalose content was measured after growth in liquid amm media supplemented with hygromycin – under a continuous selection pressure to retain the plasmid, we showed that in tppb + the amount of trehalose was restored to wild-type level . the expression of tppb was examined in mycelium from wild-type, Δtppb and tppb+. in the deletion mutant, no expression was detected, whereas in the complemented strain, the levels were in the same range as in the wild-type . from these experiments we concluded that the deletion of tppb causes the lowered trehalose levels in Δtppb. however, since the plasmid carrying the wild-type version of the gene was lost in most conidia, the tppb+ strain was not included in the following experiments.

to evaluate the importance of trehalose as a stress protectant, the trehalose contents of the Δtppb mutant and the control strains were analyzed in early stages of germination, and were subjected to lethal and sub-lethal heat and oxidative stress as well as sub-lethal salt and acid stress. the trehalose levels in Δtppb followed the same pattern of breakdown and re-synthesis as in the control strains, but they were consistently lower in accordance with the lower initial value . dormant conidia of Δtppb were significantly less tolerant to heat stress compared to the control strains; after 60 min of heat stress, the survival of Δtppb was 35% compared to 78% in wild-type. after an additional 60 min, the survival of Δtppb further decreased to 2% compared to 38% in wild-type. . these experiments were repeated with the new independent deletion mutant, Δtppb <dig>  and the results were identical to those for Δtppb . for the other stressors tested, benzoic acid, nacl and h2o <dig>  as well as long-term viability where conidia were stored in water at 4°c for a total of 8 weeks, no significant differences between the mutant and the control strains could be detected .

discussion
in this project we have studied six genes with a putative role in trehalose synthesis in a. niger: tpsa, tpsb, tpsc, tppa, tppb and tppc. all six genes encode homologous proteins and no similar gene products within the a. niger genome could be detected. three proteins, tpsa, tpsb and tpsc, have previously been identified as orthologs to the yeast protein tps <dig>  as the orthologs are conserved in related species, it is plausible that there is a functional differentiation between the paralogs, e.g. one paralog could be essential for trehalose synthesis in conidia, whereas another paralog is strictly induced by stress. this assumption is in line with the previous observation in a. niger where the expression of tpsb is stress-induced whereas tpsa is constitutively expressed  <cit> , although our data also suggest that tpsb has a role during differentiation . when deleting the trehalose-phosphate-synthase paralogs, only Δtpsa displayed a reduced trehalose content. the lower level in this mutant is in line with a previous report using a different target strain and deletion procedure  <cit> . in the related fungus, a. fumigatus, a tpsa/tpsb double deletion resulted in a strain with depleted trehalose content, and in the same study, it was shown that the expressions of tpsc and –d were very low at all time points  <cit> . these authors evaluated their expression data using rna extracted from hyphae, and in the present study, the a. niger tpsc was expressed at very low levels at 72 h. thus the results from the two fungi are not contradictory, and most likely an a. niger tpsa/tpsb deletion mutant would also have a depleted trehalose content. the results from a. niger and a. fumigatus are also in accordance with findings in a. nidulans where deletion of tpsa resulted in depleted trehalose content  <cit> , as that species does not have the tpsb paralogue. a conclusion from studying the trehalose content from these three species is that tpsa is the most important trehalose-phosphate-synthase under normal conditions, but lack of the tpsa gene can be fully compensated by tpsb in a. fumigatus and partly by at least one of tpsb or tpsc in a. niger, but not by tpsd in a. nidulans.

the deletion mutant with the most distinctive characteristics in our experiments was Δtppa, i.e. with an abnormal morphology and reduced levels of both trehalose-6-phosphate and trehalose. the altered morphology of the strain is probably due to toxicity of t6p as indicated for the corresponding deletion mutant in a. fumigatus <cit> . however, in a. niger as well as a. fumigatus and a. nidulans <cit> , mutants of tppa are not totally lacking in trehalose. therefore, it is possible that under specific conditions, e.g. when tppa is absent, tppb, and also tppc where present, may contribute to some t6p activity. another possibility is that the sugar can be synthesized by proteins other than tps/tpp, e.g. the trehalose phosphorylase pathway, for which putative genes have been identified and partially characterized in n. crassa <cit>  and a. fumigatus <cit>  and also exist in a. niger . however, it is possible to generate mutants, within the homologous tps/tpp group, in a. fumigatus and a. nidulans that totally lack trehalose  <cit> . therefore, we believe that this is the only active trehalose synthesis pathway in aspergilli. however, internal trehalose contents may not solely be dependent on the presence and expression of these six genes, as in s. cerevisiae there is a strong linkage between trehalose synthesis and the degrading trehalases  <cit>  as well as evidences of posttranscriptional activation of the genes involved in trehalose metabolism  <cit> .

besides a putative phosphatase activity, tppb and tppc may have similar biological roles as the yeast proteins tps <dig> and tsl <dig>  which also contain phosphatase domains – in yeasts, deletion of both genes is necessary before some reduction in internal trehalose content can be observed  <cit> . it is intriguing that tpsb and tppc are linked on the chromosome. we cannot explain why the conidial trehalose content in this double mutant was significantly higher after 28 days, but based on the expression patterns , it is possible that the expression of the two genes are regulated by the same factors. in addition to the above-mentioned observations, some conclusions can be drawn from the gene expression data: all identified genes were expressed, indicating that the paralogs are not inactive duplicates. for tpsc and tppb, the expressions were consistently low after 6 h, indicating that the two genes may be regulated by the same mechanism. this assumption is supported by a previous observation using a. oryzae arrays where the tpsc and tppb orthologs were down-regulated in a deletion strain of atfa, a gene encoding a transcription factor  <cit> . to our knowledge, two previous studies describing the expression of trehalose synthesis genes in a. niger during germination, using microarray technology, or in combination with rna sequencing, have been published  <cit> . with the exception that van leeuwen and co-workers  <cit>  saw a drastic drop after 2 h and then a gradual up-regulation of tpsa and tpsb, those results are in line with our findings.

the extensive measurements of internal trehalose indicate that the trehalose contents, for all strains, were low in 5 day old conidia, significantly elevated in 14 day old conidia, and then maintained at the value of 14 days . a plausible hypothesis is that conidia of a. niger reach full maturity, at least in terms of trehalose accumulation, sometime between 5 days and 2 weeks. consequently it is not advisable to perform stress experiments on young conidia because their trehalose content is not necessarily typical for the final level, especially not in kusa deficient strains that seem to have slower conidial maturation in terms of trehalose content.

we found that 2 week old conidia of Δtppb were more susceptible to heat shock than wild-type conidia, indicating that trehalose protects the spores from thermal stress. these results are in line with earlier studies in aspergillus species  <cit> . however, in contrast to results from a. fumigatus and a. nidulans, we could not detect any increased sensitivity of Δtppb to oxidative stress  <cit> , salt or acid stress, or any decreased viability after long term storage. it should be noted that unlike Δtppb in our experiments, which harbored approximately one third of wild-type trehalose content, the a. fumigatus and a. nidulans mutants were totally depleted of trehalose.

in s. cerevisiae it has been shown that, using a two-hybrid assay, the four homologous proteins physically interact. when repeating the experiments using the six identified a. niger proteins, we could observe interactions for four of six proteins. these results suggest that tppa and tpsa-c form a complex, while the phylogenetically more distant proteins, tppb and tppc, are present outside the complex. however, due to the experimental limits, it is possible that neither tppb nor tppc was correctly folded and therefore not interacting. it is notable that in s. cerevisiae, a truncated version of tsl <dig> was necessary for the success of the interaction experiments  <cit> , in contrast to our experiment in which we only used full-length proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
to conclude, in this study novel information about the six gene products involved in trehalose synthesis in a. niger has been generated. when characterizing deletion mutants, lack of the most conserved trehalose phosphate synthase tpsa, the trehalose phosphate phosphatase tppa, or the previously non-characterized tppb, resulted in lower trehalose contents. an additional insight is that the components in a putative trehalose synthesis complex differ among the aspergilli, but some gene products are common throughout the fungal kingdom.
