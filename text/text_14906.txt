BACKGROUND
sexual dimorphism extends into marked cellular, metabolic, physiological and anatomical differences and leads to sex differences in disease prevalence, expression and severity of, for example, cardiovascular  <cit> , and autoimmune  <cit>  diseases, personality  <cit>  and psychiatric disorders  <cit> . sex inequalities are an increasingly recognized challenge in both basic research and clinical medicine  <cit> , and understanding the molecular mechanisms behind sex differences may lead to new insights into sex-specific pathophysiology and treatment opportunities  <cit> .

sex differences at the dna sequence level are restricted to the sex chromosomes. on the x-chromosome, most genes are equally expressed across sex due to x-inactivation in women  <cit> . the few unshared genes located on the y chromosome are exclusively expressed in the testes, or are housekeeping genes with x-chromosome homologues that escape x-inactivation  <cit> . however, genome regulation seems highly sex-specific at secondary epigenetic levels such as dna methylation  <cit> , dnase hypersensitivity  <cit> , chromatin structure  <cit>  and gene expression  <cit> . thus, a characterization of sex differences in genome regulation by gene expression will contribute to the understanding of the molecular basis of sexual dimorphism.

animal studies have shown that sex-biased gene expression is highly tissue dependent  <cit>  and the evolution rates of sex-biased genes are higher than average  <cit> . two recent studies in mice reported sex differences in gene expression networks of correlated transcripts  <cit> . surprisingly few studies aimed at identifying and investigating sex-biased genes in humans, and only in small sample sizes . nonetheless, consistent evidence was obtained for sex-specific gene expression.

sex-differences in gene expression will depend on the hormonal status of the group considered. for instance, during menopause, much of the female-specific hormone production ceases, with downstream effects on gene expression in adipose tissue  <cit> , monocytes  <cit> , and bone  <cit> . in women using hormonal contraceptives, containing the hormones estrogen and progesterone, additional differences in gene expression may be evident as well.

for many genes, expression levels are influenced by dna polymorphisms . although the sexes do not differ at the autosomal dna sequence level, sex differences in gene expression may be caused by sex-specific eqtls  <cit>  .

here we used microarrays to identify genome-wide sex-biased gene expression in the human peripheral blood transcriptome in a large sample  from the netherlands. the sample size was sufficiently large to account for menopause status and hormonal contraceptive use. the identified sex-biased genes were characterized in terms of enrichment for functional gene ontology  and disease categories, distribution across the autosomes and sex chromosomes, tissue specificity, evolution rates, participation in major gene expression networks and the extent to which sex differences in gene expression were caused by sex-specific eqtls.

RESULTS
sample description
the sample consisted of  <dig>  individuals from the netherlands study of depression and anxiety  and netherlands twin register  cohorts . of the women, 22% were postmenopausal and 31% used hormonal contraceptives. for all participants, genome-wide gene expression in peripheral blood was assessed using microarrays with  <dig>  probe sets targeting  <dig>  genes. for each probe set, mixed models including demographic, and several technical covariates were used to test for sex effects .

the sample consisted of  <dig> subjects  from the dutch nesda and ntr cohorts.

sex effects on gene expression
sex effects on gene expression were determined by comparing men  and premenopausal women who did not use hormonal contraceptives . when considering  <dig>  autosomal transcripts targeting  <dig>  genes,  <dig> transcripts from  <dig> genes  were significantly influenced by sex . the percentage of sex-biased genes increased when only genes with a mean expression above a certain threshold were considered. for example, a mean expression threshold of  <dig> ) resulted in  <dig> % sex-biased genes, and using a threshold of  <dig> resulted in  <dig> % sex-biased genes . however, there were several transcripts with low mean expression level but with a high fold change between the sexes . in order to provide a comprehensive overview, we included all transcripts in the following analyses.

female-biased versus male-biased genes
from the sex-biased transcripts on the autosomes,  <dig>  were upregulated in females , and  <dig> in males . for each sex-biased transcript the loge fold change was computed . for female-biased transcripts the fold change was computed as the mean expression in females/mean expression in males, for male-biased genes we used -mean expression in males/mean expression in females. most absolute loge fold changes were smaller than  <dig>  , for  <dig> transcripts the absolute loge fold change was larger than  <dig>  , see additional file  <dig> for sex-biased genes and corresponding fold changes and p-values).

on the x chromosome,  <dig> transcripts from  <dig> genes were measured. out of these,  <dig> transcripts from  <dig> genes were sex-biased;  <dig>  were female-biased, and  <dig>  male-biased. seventeen of the corresponding loge fold changes were larger than  <dig>  . only the loge fold changes of the genes xist and tsix were larger than  <dig> . of the  <dig> transcripts targeting  <dig> genes on the y chromosome,  <dig> transcripts from  <dig> genes had expression levels in men that were higher than the noise measured in women;  <dig> transcripts had a loge fold change larger than  <dig> , targeting the genes eif1ay, ddx3y kdm5d, cyorf15b, cyorf15a and uty.

genomic location of sex-biased genes
for each chromosome we tested whether the genes on that chromosome enriched the sex-, male- or female-biased genes. at the autosomes, the percentage of sex-biased genes differed only slightly between chromosomes, ranging from  <dig> % on chromosome  <dig> to  <dig> % on chromosome  <dig> ; none of the autosomes enriched the sex-biased genes . the distribution of the male- and female-biased genes over the autosomes was more variable, ranging from  <dig> % at chromosome  <dig> to  <dig> % at chromosome  <dig> , and from  <dig> % at chromosome  <dig> to  <dig> % at chromosome  <dig> , however none of the autosomes enriched female or male-biased genes. as expected, female-biased genes were enriched for genes at the x-chromosome , and male-biased genes for genes at the y chromosome .

gene ontology  analysis of sex-biased genes
female-biased genes were enriched for  <dig> biological process go categories  , with as top hit immune system process . significant subcategories included response to cytokine stimulus , response to type  <dig> interferon  and lymphocyte differentiation . male-biased genes were not enriched for any bpgo category. the female-biased genes were enriched for  <dig> cellular component go  categories  and integral to membrane ). male-biased genes were enriched for  <dig> ccgo categories, with as top hit cytoplasm  and significant subcategory lysome . in additional file  <dig> the hierarchical network structure of the significant go categories is visualized.

ingenuity pathway analysis  of sex-biased genes
from the ipa biological functions, autoimmune disease ) and rheumatoid arthritis ) enriched the female-biased genes most significantly, among  <dig> other autoimmune diseases . the upstream regulator lipopolysaccharide ) was most strongly associated with the female-biased genes, among many other regulators  such as estradiol ). male-biased genes were most significantly enriched for genes linked to renal cancer , additional file 6). there were only few male-biased genes influenced by the same upstream regulators ) and hipk <dig> )).

eqtl analysis of sex-biased gene expression
eqtl analysis was performed using two sample subsets of  <dig> men and  <dig> premenopausal women who did not take hormonal contraceptives, for which genome-wide snp and gene expression data were available . for each of the  <dig> autosomal sex-biased transcripts, eqtls were computed for men and women separately. at a fdr of  <dig>  there were  <dig> cis eqtls  and  <dig> trans eqtls ) for men, and  <dig> cis eqtls  and  <dig> trans eqtls ) for women. for the pooled eqtls  genotype-sex interactions were assessed using a mixed model that included data from men and women. at a fdr of  <dig>  no significant genotype-sex interactions were observed.

sex-biased genes highly enrich modules of correlated transcripts
weighted gene co-expression network analysis   <cit>  was used to identify modules of correlated transcripts, for men and women separately. both analyses resulted in  <dig> modules with >70% transcript overlap between the male and the corresponding female module for  <dig> of the  <dig> modules . one module had only ~40% overlap. thus, gene expression correlation structure is similar between men and women, and here we focus on properties of the intersection of the overlapping modules. interestingly,  <dig> of these intersected modules were highly enriched with female-biased or male-biased genes. there were three modules with more than 30% male-biased genes, and two modules with more than 30% female-biased genes. the modules were highly enriched for several go terms . we calculated the pairwise transcript correlations within each intersected module or men and women separately. for two modules containing male-biased genes the correlations were significantly stronger in males than in females . thus, these modules contained around 30% of male-biased genes, but also the majority  of the interactions in the module were stronger in males compared to females.

evolution rates of sex-biased genes
to test whether sex-biased genes have evolved faster than non sex-biased genes, we tested for enrichment in two sets of genes that were previously identified as rapidly evolving:  <dig> genes from the human paml browser  <cit>  and  <dig> genes from a study comparing human and chimpanzee genomes  <cit> . sex-biased, male-biased and female-biased genes were not enriched for any of the two gene sets . next, we tested whether dn, ds and dn/ds  as provided by  <cit>  were different in sex-biased, male-biased and female-biased genes compared to non sex-biased genes, but found no significant differences .

tissue specificity of sex-biased genes
we downloaded analysis results of two human studies that identified sex-biased genes in muscle  <cit>  and in liver  <cit> . in muscle,  <dig> sex-biased genes were identified on the autosomes which were enriched with the sex-biased genes we identified , additional file 8). on the x chromosome  <dig> genes were identified as sex-biased in muscle, of which  <dig> were also identified in blood , additional file 8). in liver,  <dig> sex-biased genes were identified on the autosomes which were enriched with the sex-biased genes we identified , additional file 8). on the x chromosome  <dig> genes were identified as sex-biased in liver, of which  <dig> were also identified in blood , additional file 8).

sex-biased genes in postmenopausal and hormonal contraceptive using women
to examine whether sex differences in gene expression depend on hormonal status, sex effects were computed by comparing men  with postmenopausal women  and women using hormonal contraceptives . on the autosomes, there were  <dig> transcripts differentially expressed between postmenopausal women and men. from these  <dig> transcripts   <dig> overlapped with the  <dig> sex-biased transcripts identified in non-hormonal contraceptives using premenopausal  women. when comparing the hc women with men, a much larger number of  <dig>  differentially expressed transcripts were identified . from these transcripts,  <dig> were overlapping with the  <dig> sex-biased transcripts identified in nhc women. for the  <dig> transcripts identified in nhc women, loge fold changes were computed for the difference between each of the three groups of women  compared to men. when comparing these fold changes between postmenopausal and nhc women, it became clear that most of the fold changes have the same sign  but that the fold changes in nhc women are larger than those in postmenopausal women for 80% of the transcripts . also the fold changes of nhc women and hc women often have the same sign , and the fold changes of hc women were often larger than those observed in nhc women . this shows that many gene expression differences between women and men become smaller when women reach menopause, and are larger when women use hormonal contraceptives, which reinforces the role of estrogen in regulating sex-biased genes.

age specific sex effects on gene expression
age has a strong influence on gene expression  <cit> . to examine whether sex effects on gene expression are age-range specific, we separately analyzed the data for three age groups , 31- <dig>  and 41- <dig> ). in these  <dig> age groups we identified  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> autosomal sex-biased genes respectively , which overlapped for >98% with the sex-biased genes identified in the total sample . the three sets of sex-biased genes identified in these age groups overlapped to a lesser extent with each other . however, the fold changes between men and women of the sex-biased genes identified in the total sample were highly concordant between age ranges , suggesting that the identified sex effects occur at all ages, but that some effects may be stronger at a certain age or may not have been identified due to reduced power in the smaller groups of selected ages.

discussion
at the dna autosomal sequence level sexes do not differ, as established by a well-powered meta-analysis  <cit> , suggesting an important role for higher molecular levels, such as the transcriptome, in the manifestation of sexual dimorphisms. indeed, animal studies have shown that the transcriptome is highly differential between sexes  <cit> . in humans, gene expression differences have been reported in liver  <cit> , lymphoblastoid cell lines  <cit> , and muscle  <cit> , but only in studies with relatively small sample sizes . here we analyzed the sex differences in the peripheral blood transcriptome by assessing  <dig>  probe sets targeting  <dig>  genes genome wide in a well-characterized large dutch cohort  taking into account the impact of hormonal contraceptive use and menopausal status in women.

number of female- and male-biased genes
on the autosomes, we identified  <dig> genes  that were differentially expressed between men and premenopausal women not using hormonal contraceptives. of these genes,  <dig> % were female-biased. the autosomes had rather similar proportions of sex-biased genes indicating the sex-biased genes can be found equally frequent across the entire genome, as opposed to what was found in liver  <cit>  where several chromosomes enrich sex-biased genes. it is important to note that the filter criteria used for selecting probe sets highly influences the number of sex-biased genes; the percentage of sex-biased genes increased with the threshold for mean expression level from  <dig> % up to  <dig> %. importantly, we have shown that hormonal contraceptives and menopause status, which were not taken into account in previous studies in humans, highly influence the number and effect sizes of sex differences in gene expression. although it has been indicated that the percentage of sex-biased genes in non-human vertebrates is highly tissue dependent , our described range of  <dig> - <dig> % for sex-biased genes is comparable to that found in human liver . peripheral blood consists of a mixture of blood cell types , hence the sex differences we identified must either be present in all subcell types or, when present in only one cell type, strong enough to be observed in the accumulative measurement. by stratifying the sample into three age groups we showed that the size of the sex effects may be age dependent for some genes, but the direction of the effects are highly concordant between age groups.

we found a significant but small overlap of sex-biased autosomal genes identified in peripheral blood with those previously identified in muscle or liver, further confirming substantial tissue specificity of sex-biased genes. across tissue circulating exosomes contain rna and could contribute to the overlapping expression profiles between muscle, liver and blood  <cit> . sex-biased x chromosome genes showed must larger overlap between tissues, indicating that escape from x-inactivation is highly similar between tissues. previous studies have reported that sex-biased genes may evolve more rapidly than average in vertebrates  <cit> , human brain  <cit>  and liver  <cit> . however, sex-biased genes in the peripheral blood transcriptome identified in our study did not include enrichment of fast evolving genes. in women, most genes on one x chromosome are not expressed due to x chromosome inactivation  <cit> . some genes escape x-inactivation and are expressed from both x chromosomes  <cit> . we showed that in peripheral blood the x chromosome is enriched for female-biased genes;  <dig> % of the genes measured on the x chromosome are female-biased. this percentage, however, is only slightly higher than the average percentage identified at the autosomes , which shows a major role of autosomal genes in sex-specific gene expression.

the role of estradiol in gene expression sex differences
estrogen is the primary female sex hormone and estrogenic activity is present at about two fold increased concentration in women as compared to men. estradiol, the predominant estrogen in terms of absolute serum levels, activates estrogen receptors that bind to dna sequences to activate or suppress gene expression, and many efforts have been made to find its target genes  in mcf- <dig> cancer cell line  <cit>  because of its role in breast cancer  <cit> . here we show that in peripheral blood 18% of the identified sex-biased genes are known to be regulated by estradiol, and several additional findings suggest that the sex difference in estrogen levels underlie multiple sex differences in gene expression. first, from the  <dig> genes with high male/female fold changes,  <dig> are involved in common diseases and influenced by estrogen; gper , adm , lcn <dig> , mpo , a biomarker for cardiovascular disease risk  <cit> , erg . in liver, sex differences in gene expression are mainly caused by sex-specific growth hormone secretion  <cit> . growth hormones are regulated by estrogen  <cit> , hence the effect of estrogen on sex-specific gene expression in peripheral blood may also be mediated by growth hormone secretion.

immune system processes predominant in female-biased genes
the immune system function is known to be different between sexes; women produce more vigorous immune reactions and are more prone to autoimmune diseases  <cit> . here we identified a large number of genes that potentially contribute to the immune system sex differences;  <dig> % of female-biased genes are in the go category immune system process. from the  <dig> female-biased genes linked to the immune system,  <dig> are regulated by estradiol, which confirms the role of estrogen in the sex-specific immune system functioning  <cit> . most interestingly, ingenuity pathway analysis revealed that female-biased genes are highly enriched for genes involved in the toll-like receptor  driven innate immune defense, suggesting some intrinsic innate immune activity sex differences. increased female expression of immunoglobulin is reflective of concomitant more active humoral immune activity. these functions are compatible with an activated leukocyte, cytokine production and type  <dig> interferon activity observed in the go enrichment analysis and might explain why women are more resistant to certain infections, and suffer a high incidence of autoimmune diseases compared to men  <cit> . for example, rheumatoid arthritis occurs almost twice as often in women as in men  <cit> . female-biased genes were enriched for genes linked to rheumatoid arthritis, including the gene il6r, which is a well-known target in rheumatoid arthritis treatment  <cit> . the identified female-biased genes provide a framework for future research to unravel the mechanism of sex-biased immune regulation and autoimmune diseases.

annotation of male-biased genes
surprisingly, male-biased genes were not enriched for go categories, and thus serve a wide variety of biological functions. in ipa, however, male-biased genes were most significantly enriched for genes linked to renal cancer, including the well established renal cancer gene csf1r  <cit> . it is notable that a recent meta-analysis on sex differences in renal cell cancer presentation and survival showed a ratio of  <dig>  of renal cell carcinoma for males compared to females  <cit> . the cellular component go categories indicate the part of a cell at which a gene product is located. topographical categorization revealed that male-biased gene products occur more often intracellularly, in particular at the cytoplasm, whereas female-biased genes occur more often integral to the membrane.

sex-specific eqtls do not underly sex-biased gene expression
a previous study  showed that a substantial amount of eqtls is sex-specific, but not for eqtls from genes with sex-biased expression  <cit> . here we confirm this finding by showing that for the sex-biased genes there were no significant eqtl-sex interactions. this shows the importance of other factors, such as estradiol and other hormones, in causing gene expression sex differences.

sex-biased genes in modules of correlated transcripts
wgcna analyses resulted in highly similar modules of correlated transcripts for men and women, similar to findings in mice  <cit> . the  <dig> modules were highly enriched for male or female-biased genes, indicating that sex-biased genes play an important role in the major gene expression networks. module # <dig> and # <dig> contained each more than 30% female-biased genes and were enriched for the go category immune system response, which shows that immune system genes operate in correlated groups that are partially sex-biased. module # <dig> contained  <dig> % male biased genes, enriched the go category immune response  and contained 92% stronger pairwise correlations in men than in women. this module contained the interleukin receptor il2b gene, and ipa analysis showed that  <dig> of the  <dig> genes in this module are known to be regulated by the cytokine il <dig>  and  <dig> of them are related to cancer  including the female-biased genes prf <dig> and gzmh essential for natural killer -cell cytotoxicity  <cit> . module # <dig> contained  <dig> % male-biased genes, was enriched for the go term coagulation  and 76% of the pairwise correlations in this module are higher in men than in women. ipa analysis shows that from this module  <dig> genes are regulated by tgfb <dig> , and  <dig> genes are related to heart or vascular disease, including the male-biased genes ptgs <dig> , itga2b, itgb <dig>  f13a and gp1ba which are candidate stroke risk genes  <cit> . this suggests that the modules # <dig> and # <dig> may play a role in the sex differences in cancer and cardiovascular disease, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS
we showed that sex-biased genes occur in large numbers throughout the human peripheral blood transcriptome, suggesting an important role of sex-specific gene expression in sexual dimorphisms. estrogen appears to be a key regulator of sex-biased genes, also shown by the effect of menopause and hormonal contraceptives on gene expression sex differences. sex-biased genes are highly enriched with genes linked to common diseases and may contribute to sex-differences in these diseases. understanding the molecular mechanisms behind sex inequalities can lead to new insights into sex-specific pathophysiology and treatment opportunities.
