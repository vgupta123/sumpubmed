BACKGROUND
protein phosphatase 2a  regulates cellular proliferation and tissue growth by antagonizing protein kinases and plays an important role in controlling cell cycle checkpoints, regulating nuclear telomerase activity and modulating dephosphorylation of neurofilaments  <cit> . it is believed that the enzyme flexibility and the substrate specificity are determined by the regulatory subunit  that binds to the ubiquitous catalytic  and scaffolding  subunits  <cit>  to form the heterotrimeric pp2a.

the regulatory b subunits can be categorized into three distinct families based on their homology, namely b , b' , b" and b' " . furthermore, each b family is composed of several isoforms from different genes  <cit> . there is no sequence or structural similarities among the three gene families. the brain-specific regulatory b subunit, ppp2r2b , is widely expressed in the neurons of brain and cerebellum and consists of tryptophan-glutamate repeat-containing β-propeller proteins. the various n termini of b subunit determine enzyme activity, subcellular localizations and neuronal functions of pp2a  <cit> . mainly expressed in purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex  <cit>  and in tissues of spinocerebellar ataxia  <cit> , ppp2r2b is also known in mediating pp2a-regulated dephosphorylation of several substrates; they include vimentin  <cit>  and histone- <dig>  <cit>  as well as microtube-associated protein in neuron cells  <cit> .

the alternative splicing of ppp2r2b generates two major isoforms. they include bβ <dig> and bβ <dig> with two distinct n terminal tails  <cit> . the different n termini with  <dig> and  <dig> residues of bβ <dig> and bβ <dig> each encode distinctive subcellular signals that target ppp2r2b isoforms to cytoplasm and mitochondria, respectively, and affect cellular phosphatase activity  <cit> . the up-regulated mitochondrial bβ <dig> was reported promoting apoptosis in response to deprived growth factors  <cit> , while an elevated expression of cytosolic bβ <dig> due to cag repeat expansion at the 5' end of the gene causes autosomal dominant disease of spinocerebellar ataxia type  <dig>   <cit> .

the aberrant expression of brain-specific ppp2r2b affecting pp2a activity has been implicated in cerebellar atrophy  <cit> . translocation of ppp2r2b to mitochondria promotes mitochondria fission, apoptosis  <cit>  and neuronal differentiation  <cit> . being implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, oxidative stress causes neuron cell damage and reduction of viable cells. how cells with overexpressed ppp2r2b react to environmental stress remains unclear. mitochondria are the principal targets for reactive oxygen species . to address this, the work began with generation of stable cell lines by transferring bβ <dig> and bβ <dig>  respectively, into human neuroblastoma sk-n-sh cells. the stable clones targeting ectopic ppp2r2b to mitochondria or cytoplasm exhibit characteristics of autophagy that is distinct from the parental cells. furthermore, only bβ <dig> clones were sensitive to ros treatment and susceptible to autophagy-mediated cell death. the resulting apoptosis can be suppressed by chemical inhibitor and rna interference of the related autophagy gene, and thereby preventing cells from ros damage-induced cell death. the work illustrates the significance of autophagy in maintaining viabilities of neuronal cells with ectopically transferred ppp2r2b as well as in accelerating pathogenesis when encountered with oxidative stress.

RESULTS
the establishment of clones targeting bβ <dig> to mitochondria and bβ <dig> cytoplasma, respectively
the expression of b family regulatory subunits regulates cell developmental patterns in brain  <cit> . the antibiotic-resistant clones from human neuroblastoma cells, sk-n-sh, through ectopic transfection of either bβ <dig> or bβ <dig> cdna' s driven by cytomegalovirus promoter were established as stable cell lines that can be propagated in serum-supplemented media. in addition to the basal levels in sk-n-sh cells, three isolated clones exhibited increased immune-active signals by sequence-specific bβ <dig> antiserum , while two were detected by bβ <dig> antiserum . a parallel increase of pp2a activities in the immunoprecipitates was also observed in the selected bβ <dig>  and bβ <dig>  clones that corresponded with their increased sensitivities to antisera in western blot. in contrast to the parental cells, the stable bβ <dig> clones tend to aggregate to form clusters in culture .

the strong signals in clones by bβ <dig> antiserum overlapping with mitotracker green marked direct targeting of ectopic bβ <dig> at mitochondria ; while little overlay was detected between mitochondria and the increased signal as determined by bβ <dig> antiserum indicated cytoplasm distribution of bβ <dig> in the isolated clones . despite some degree of non-specific staining by the antisera, the results provided evidence that stable clones by targeting cytoplasm with ectopic bβ <dig> and mitochondria with bβ <dig>  respectively, can be achieved.

the enhanced autophagosome formation in clones with ectopic ppp2r2b
an increased autophagy has been reported in human cells or tissues with neuronal injury  <cit> . we then assessed whether coordinated regulation of mitochondrial networks and autophagy-regulated cell viability can be recapitulated in clones with acquisition of ppp2r2b functions. as lc <dig> is modified with the lipid phospatidylethanolamine before being located to autophagosomes  <cit> , the emitted fluorescence can be used to monitor autophagosome formation in cells through transient transfection with expression vector, green fluorescent protein-tagged light chain  <dig> . the results showed that gfp puncta that represented autophagy development can be detected in both bβ <dig> and bβ <dig> clones, but not in the parental cells . thus, the presence of autophagosome is closely related to ectopically expressed ppp2r2b.

sensitivity of peroxide-induced apoptotic cell death is associated with ectopic bβ2
the two ros generators h2o <dig>  and t-butyl hydroperoxide   suppressed growth in bβ <dig> clones in dose-dependent manners, while both bβ <dig> clones and sk-n-sh cells with empty vector alone were not affected. compared with h2o <dig>  the suppression of viable cells was more evident in tbhp that exerted more sensitivity in cells with ectopic bβ <dig>  the escalated cell death is proportional to the levels of bβ <dig>  in which bβ2# <dig> was more sensitive to peroxide treatment.

an increase of sub-g <dig> populations was also detected in bβ <dig> clones by h2o <dig>  and tbhp . the results indicated that the decrease of viable cells can be attributed to apoptotic cell death that was not observed in cells with ectopic bβ <dig>  thus, it is evident that the apoptotic cell death can be attributed to exogenous ros in sk-n-sh cells with ectopic bβ <dig> 

ros-induced apoptosis in bβ <dig> clones can be rescued by autophagy inhibitor, 3-ma and atg <dig> sirna
autophagic stress can be morphologically recognized by accumulations of autophagic vacuoles in cells  <cit> . the autophagy marker protein lc <dig>  a mammalian homolog of the yeast atg <dig> protein, is covalently modified and redistributes to acidic vesicular organelles  with covalent lipidation as seen by mobility shift from lc3-i to lc3-ii by sds-page. as shown by the acridine-orange staining  and western blotting with lc- <dig> antibody , induction of ros accelerated cellular changes that are consistent with enhanced autophagy as indicated by the induced formation of avo' s  <cit>  and the increased lipidation of lc <dig>  in addition to the basal level. the effect was reverted by the autophagy inhibitor, 3-ma  <cit> .

with no distinct affect on cell growth per se, 3-ma rescued bβ <dig> clones from peroxide-induced cell death  by suppressing formation of apoptotic cells  in dose dependent manner. thus, the accelerated autophagy by peroxide injury antagonized cell survival with supplemented mitochondrial ppp2r2b. the ros-induced growth inhibition became less evident as cells were pretreated with 3-ma. the addition of 3-ma that rescued apoptotic death in bβ <dig> clones reflects the role of autophagy that not only protects cells but initiated apoptotic cell death under oxidative stress.

more work was extended using sirna-dependent knock-down expression of the essential autophagy gene atg <dig>  <cit> . transfection with atg7-specific sirna in bβ <dig> clones down-regulated atg <dig> expression , suppressed cell growth inhibition  and interfered development of apoptosis  by tbhp, while cells with transfer of the scrambled  sirna remained unaffected. moreover, knock-down of atg <dig> expression repressed tbhp-induced accumulation of the lc3-ii isoform , that further corroborated autophagy with the development of apoptosis.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
pp2a deregulation has been vastly implicated in the onset of neurodegenerative diseases  <cit> . the mechanisms of pp2a activity responsible for the disrupted neuron function remain unclear and are far from being understood  <cit> . intervention of normal brain or cerebellar pp2a function is crucial in the developing neurodegenerative pathology  <cit> . in an effort to learn how the increased expression of ppp2r2b isoforms affects cell growth, genes encoding proteins encoding different targeting sequences were transferred into human sk-n-sh cells. the clones with ectopically expressed ppp2r2b can be propagated as stable cell lines. our work showed that discrete antisera cross-reactivity, in which mitochondria can be stained by bβ <dig> and cytoplasm by bβ <dig>  respectively. to understand the function of the ectopic gene in the stable clones, it will be important to further analyze the fractions at subcellular levels.

the stable clones forming aggregation in culture exhibited autophagy characteristics that are distinct from the parental cells. autophagy is a lysosome-dependent degradation pathway regulated by extracellular nutrients or trophic factors  <cit> . cells exhibiting basal rate of autophagy maintain homeostasis and survival of neurons under stress that protects them from pathogenesis  <cit> . despite their relatively slow growth rate compared to the parental cells , clones with ectopic brain-specific subunit ppp2r2b were able to sustain minor increases of autophagosome formation that maintains cell viable. the formation of autophagosome in both bβ <dig> and bβ <dig> clones  demonstrated how cells survive when encountered with stress conditions. while heterotrimeric pp2a holoenzyme containing all three regulatory subunit families can affect events ranging from the initiation of dna replication to vertebrate axis formation to apoptosis  <cit> , the up-regulated mitochondrial ppp2r2b putatively serves to deregulate protein kinases cascades, thereby making cells autophagic as seen in some neuron disorders  <cit> .

numerous studies suggested a close relationship between dysfunctional mitochondria and autophagy. mitochondrial perturbation is one of the sources to induce autophagic cell death  <cit> . the disturbance of autophagy-lysosome balance has been recognized as a major cause in numerous neurodegenerative disorders  <cit> . while low levels of autophagy maintains cell viabilities in both stable bβ <dig> and bβ <dig> clones, only the latter was sensitive to peroxide injury by initiating apoptosis  with concomitant increase of avo' s . inhibition of autophagy by the chemical inhibitor, 3-ma,  and rna interference-mediated knockdown of atg <dig>  reverted the process. thus, oxidative stress-induced cell death in bβ <dig> cells as shown in annexin v staining and growth assays demonstrated that the progression of autophagy lead bβ <dig> cells to apoptosis.

although autophagy is capable of keeping cells from being damaged, the work provided evidence that, in addition to being protective, the increased autophagy as a result of peroxide injury can be pathogenic resulting from apoptosis. our work showed that the attenuated autophagy prolonged cell survival by reducing formation of the accumulated autophagosome following peroxide injury. given the fact that oxidative stress is an origin of disturbing cell homeostasis, it is conceivable that the reduced autophagic source may be an alternative approach to ameliorate harmful effects to neuronal system  <cit> . being necessary at basal level for maintaining normal axonal and synaptic structures, particularly in purkinje neurons, excessive autophagy can be neurotoxic and inhibition by chemical regulators prevents the onset of neurodegeneration  <cit> . further investigation on how excessive autophagy affects cell signaling and growth under oxidative stress will provide more targets to understand the basis of the diseases.

more evidence indicated that pp2a activity can be regulated by extracellular signals and cell cycle  <cit> . how altered cell signaling in organelles, particularly those in mitochondria that impinge viable neuron cells as a result of increased expression of the regulatory subunit ppp2r2b, provides an interesting topic for developing more effective preventive measures in development of neuron disorders.
