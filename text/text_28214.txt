BACKGROUND
human embryonic stem cells  are a potentially limitless, albeit controversial, source of therapeutic cells for numerous diseases and injuries. it is likely that different hesc lines are best suited to different uses, but at present, it is rare for any laboratory to work with more than a few lines. one reason is the expense of these lines; another is that in the usa hesc are governed by a dual-track policy. cell lines derived prior to  <dig> august  <dig>  can be examined using federal funds, and currently much of the available information on hesc biology has been generated using these funds and cell lines  <cit> . however, cell lines derived after this date are far more numerous, but while it is legal to work on these lines using non-federal funds, information on their properties remains sparse. government-funded researchers are reluctant to use these lines given the difficulties in accounting for federal and non-federal funds.

the lack of comparative analysis of hesc lines matters, because the properties and behavior of each line are uniquely shaped by their histories. it has become clear that different derivations produce hesc lines that are similar overall, but with inherent differences in gene expression, methylation status, x-chromosome inactivation, rate of self-renewal, and ability to differentiate  <cit> . more importantly, the behavior of cells and their phenotypic state changes as culture conditions and the stress to which they are subjected is altered, and permanent genomic changes frequently occur as passage numbers increase  <cit> . this has led to great difficulty in comparing results from one laboratory with another and even comparing results with different passages of the same cell line.

therefore, thorough and routine characterization of hesc lines is essential to avoid compromising the validity of results. the most common characterization method for hesc is immunocytochemical analysis of a handful of markers, including ssea- <dig>  ssea- <dig>  tra-1- <dig>  tra-1- <dig>  and oct-3/ <dig>  <cit> . the next most frequent is reverse transcription pcr, which is used for those group of genes whose expression is involved in maintenance of the undifferentiated state  <cit> . while these assays certainly give indications of the undifferentiated state of the cells, they do not address other issues such as pluripotentiality or the degree of culture adaptation and genomic instability.

to facilitate comparisons among lines, the hesc research community has begun to develop a number of tools. work is proceeding toward conditions that support the propagation of all lines  <cit> , sets of markers that truly define the undifferentiated and unadapted state of the cells  <cit> , and markers predictive of the differentiation capacity of the cells  <cit> . the work presented here is part of efforts to create a database of the properties of each line and to identify a reference standard for comparisons between laboratories. to this end, we have assembled a set of molecular tests for hesc lines that assess identity, stability of the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, histocompatibility profile, and the undifferentiated state of the cells. some of these assays have been previously performed on individual lines, but to our knowledge, no single group has used all of these tests on any single line, and few comparisons between lines have been made publicly available.

in this paper, we describe the analysis of multiple lines and show that this entire set of tests can be performed with a minimal sample size and over a short time period, and that these tests allow comparison of datasets across cell lines . we suggest that an internet database of hesc characterization data and standard reference materials will permit the research community to readily compare cell lines without the necessity of growing all lines in their own laboratory or tracking pre- and post- <dig> august cell lines.

RESULTS
the  <dig> cell lines analyzed are listed in table  <dig>  the lines were grown on feeders, or feeder-free on fibronectin, using bovine, human, or artificial serum according to the providers' protocols .

measures of identity
the results of short tandem repeat  analysis of these lines are shown in figure  <dig>  the eight str markers plus amelogenin used here are capable of identifying individual human genomes with a discrimination of  <dig> in hundreds of millions  <cit> . each of the early passage lines studied here was shown to be genetically distinct from the others. each late passage line or karyotypically abnormal subline  is identical to the early passage line, showing no evidence of overgrowth by contaminating cells. only two instances of possibly heterogeneous cultures are observed. cultures of the i <dig> line were grown in two separate laboratories, and one of these cultures shows a reproducible abnormality in the chromosome  <dig> microsatellite marker d13s <dig>  one culture at passage  <dig> shows a third allele  for this marker; the low intensity of the signal suggests either an abnormal subpopulation or lessened pcr efficiency. the second culture, grown independently to passage  <dig>  shows two normal alleles at all loci. the second abnormal observation was also found at the d13s <dig> locus in the line sa <dig>  this line shows three distinct alleles at passage  <dig>  consistent with trisomy  <dig> as shown in the karyotype  <cit> . in contrast, the karyotypically normal subline sa <dig> , which was subcloned from sa <dig>  carries only two alleles on chromosome  <dig>  the lines h <dig> and h <dig> show no changes visible by str between lower and higher passage numbers.

the histocompatibility profile of each line was determined by sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes, and is summarized in table  <dig>  each line has a unique histocompatibility profile, while the two sublines sa <dig>  and bg01v are identical to their parental lines. only the ntera- <dig> embryonal carcinoma line shows an atypical histocompatibility profile, being homozygous at all tested loci.

measures of stability
finer resolution analysis of genomic stability is afforded by single nucleotide polymorphism  assays. in this analysis, over  <dig>  snps were assayed by microarray. the average snp spacing in the genome is  <dig> kb.

comparison of the signal intensity and separation angle of all snps shows distinct discontinuities over certain chromosomes . this is the same approach used with affymetrix snp arrays to determine copy number  <cit> ; however, reference beadarray data from known diploid loci is required to translate intensities into copy number. nevertheless, local changes in the allele intensity ratio  are seen in chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and a portion of chromosome x of bg01v, chromosome  <dig> of sa <dig>  and within the q arm of chromosome  <dig> in h <dig>  all of these areas have previously been shown to be duplicated in these cell lines  <cit> . no other significant discontinuities were found for any other chromosome of any line.

sequencing of the entire mitochondrial genome  was performed using an oligonucleotide sequencing microarray , as previously described  <cit> . briefly, 'early' and 'late' passages of nine paired hesc lines  were sequenced for alterations in mtdna in the course of in vitro passage. the results of this study have been published elsewhere  <cit> , and six heteroplasmic sequence alterations occurring in two of nine  later passage hesc lines were identified and confirmed by conventional dideoxy sequencing. the raw mitochip data on the nine hesc lines is available on request .

measures of pluripotency
gene-expression analysis was performed by beadarray  to assay the transcriptome of each line. rna expression profiles of several lines were directly compared with rna from a pool of three undifferentiated lines previously used to compare expression by est enumeration and mpss  <cit>  . the normal lines tested  show an average correlation coefficient  of  <dig>  for genes detected with high confidence . karyotypically abnormal es and ec lines  produce r <dig> values of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. this suggests that overall gene expression is more sensitive to the difference between normal and culture-adapted lines than is the use of immunocytochemical markers.

not all genes contribute equally to the pluripotency of hesc, of course. recent work comparing the transcriptomes of multiple hesc lines has identified core sets of  <dig> es-specific genes  <cit>  and  <dig> genes specifically upregulated in differentiating embryoid bodies  <cit> , which have been used to create focused arrays for hesc testing. of the es-specific genes,  <dig> could be identified and detected at high confidence in our pooled hesc lines . nearly all of these were detected at similar levels in all of the individual hesc lines tested  and in the ec line ntera- <dig>  every line but bg <dig> under- or over-expressed by  <dig> -fold at least one es marker, especially i <dig>  which underexpressed  <dig> genes including tdgf- <dig>  rex- <dig>  and utf- <dig>  few es-specific genes were overexpressed, except for the variant line bg01v, which overexpressed four genes, including abcg <dig>  and ntera- <dig>  which overexpressed two genes, including the germ cell tumor marker gdf <dig> 

of the  <dig> differentiation-specific genes,  <dig> could be detected at a significant level in the pooled hesc lines. approximately 89–96% of these were also detected in any individual line, except for bg01v, in which  <dig> genes were significantly expressed. this agrees with previous findings of low-level expression of diverse differentiation markers in undifferentiated hesc  <cit> . ntera- <dig> and i <dig> underexpressed the greatest number of these markers, while h <dig> and ntera- <dig> also overexpressed six eb-specific genes each. in h <dig>  three of these were collagen genes, suggesting the presence of human fibroblasts possibly differentiated from the hesc grown under feeder-free conditions.

discussion
the technical demands of culturing human embryonic stem cells are already well known in the field. it is now becoming clearer that frequent characterization of the cells in culture must be added to the burden. the present data confirm the general finding that hesc lines in culture accumulate genomic, epigenetic, and mitochondrial changes within as few as  <dig> passages  <cit> . as a result, laboratories attempting to expand hesc lines must subject them to frequent characterization tests sensitive to aberrations below the resolution of g-banded karyotypes. the number and frequency of required tests also increases the value of rapid and convenient test methods, such as the many array-based molecular tests currently on the market or in development. this manuscript presents a molecular characterization scheme for hesc lines that helps to define the state of the cells. the tests include measures of identity, stability, and self-renewal, and the undifferentiated state of the cells. in addition, we have provided data on potential reference standards for hesc research. we show by examples that each of these tests offers important insights into the state of the hesc line and that the combination of these tests provides a unique characterization profile of a given cell line that is sensitive to the deleterious changes that can occur in culture.

this initiative, led by the american type culture collection  and supported by most of the providers of hesc lines, represents a complementary effort that uses cell lines approved by the national institutes of health to develop a basis for comparison across different laboratories. equally important, by providing data in the same format on a new post- <dig> august line, it facilitates the direct comparison of lines eligible and ineligible for federal funding to determine which cell line is best suited to the individual researcher's needs. such a comparison has not to our knowledge been previously performed, as it is largely impossible for most researchers in the usa.

our estimate of testing costs for this characterization scheme is that these can be completed for a single line for approximately $ <dig>  the identity, stability, and undifferentiated state of lines can be assessed with less than  <dig> μg of genomic dna and  <dig> ng of total rna. this can be obtained from 2– <dig> million cells, comparable with the amount required to run a single karyotype analysis using giemsa-banded metaphase spreads. we further note that it will not be necessary for every researcher to repeatedly perform every one of these tests. we have identified commercial service providers both within and outside the usa, which can perform these analyses, and atcc and other banks have offered to similarly characterize the lines they maintain.

the characterization scheme is composed of tests chosen on the basis of comprehensiveness, wide availability, and cost efficiency. for example, str analysis as a measure of identity is a simple pcr-based analysis that is available in a kit from multiple providers, and can be readily run in any laboratory. one advantage of this assay is that it also readily distinguishes male and female samples, and in theory can be used to examine relatedness between samples and the larger database sets that have been generated for other purposes. atcc is developing a comprehensive database of dna profiles of hesc and other human cell lines based on str loci  <cit> . this test allows for discrimination of at least  <dig> in  <dig> million individuals  <cit> .

hla typing of hesc lines is essential, both for future use in transplantation and for the immediate goal of estimating how many hesc lines are required to meet the needs of all potential patients  <cit> . hla typing at the allelic level included hla-a, hla-b, hla-c, hla-drb, and hla-dqb loci.

snp arrays are commonly used for mapping new markers of genetic disease and for detecting loh in cancer. recently, algorithms have been developed that allow oligonucleotide snp arrays to measure chromosomal copy number at high resolution  <cit> . this expands the utility of snps to detect non-reciprocal translocations, aneuploidy, and partial amplifications or deletions of chromosomes. maitra et al have used this method to show that hesc in culture can acquire amplifications or deletions of small chromosomal regions  <cit> . the snp array method is of great value in characterizing hesc lines, as it improves the resolution for detecting genetic alterations. conventional giemsa-stained karyotypes or spectral karyotypes have a resolution of about 1– <dig> mb. comparative genomic hybridization  of metaphase spreads has a resolution of approximately  <dig> mb, and array-based cgh with genomic or cdna clones has improved this to < <dig> mb. bacterial artificial chromosome clone arrays have now improved the resolution to < <dig> kb. in contrast, currently available arrays of  <dig>  snps have a potential resolution of about  <dig> kb. with over  <dig> million snps already mapped in the human genome, increased density arrays could drop this even further.

like snp genotyping, sequencing of the mitochondrial dna offers the dual benefits of measuring identity  as well as stability over passages. mitochondrial genes accumulate mutations in the somatic cells of aging animals. mice in which mtdna damage is accelerated show numerous symptoms of premature aging  <cit> . the connections between tissue stem cells and aging are still controversial, but it has been demonstrated that changes in mitochondrial properties correlate with reduced competence of adult stem cells  <cit> . thus, although mtdna mutations are quite common in somatic cells, the functional consequences may be greater in stem cells. array-based sequencing of mtdna is cost effective, and the reduced number of reactions needed in long-range pcr reactions and the automated analysis of genotype data using the ra tools software  significantly decreases analysis time.

measures of identity and stability are generally of less concern to researchers growing hescs than are the potency and undifferentiated state of the cells. these qualities are generally assessed by antibody staining for protein biomarkers. however, with the ability to rapidly assess expression of all human genes, it is possible to measure the expression of undifferentiated markers and any conceivable differentiation marker in a single step. the gene-expression profile of pluripotent hescs has not been completely defined, but much work has been carried out toward defining common sets in undifferentiated and differentiating hescs  <cit> . the use of this microarray method to distinguish undifferentiated and differentiated hesc cultures has been demonstrated  <cit> . this gives the possibility of assigning a quality score to any hesc culture, which will be of value in improving culture methods.

the main drawback of these molecular methods is that the cells are assayed as an amalgam, so the ability to detect differentiated cells or aberrant subpopulations must be demonstrated. for example, we have estimated that at least 20% of the population must carry a genetic abnormality before it can be detected by a snp array . currently, this method is often used to screen for loh in cancer. normal cells within the tumor severely degrade the sensitivity of loh detection when as few as 10% are present, but copy-number detection is less sensitive to mixed populations  <cit> . similarly, the presence of low levels of differentiated cells is likely to escape notice when surveying global gene expression. the data presented here shows the overexpression of collagen genes in a sample of hesc cultured in feeder-free conditions, which suggests that the microarray method can detect differentiating subpopulations, but there is no way to retrospectively determine the level of differentiation.

owing to the demands of culturing hescs, it is rare that any one laboratory will bring together numerous lines to compare them under identical conditions. thus, comparisons must be facilitated between laboratories by the promulgation of standard reference materials. the present work has thus compared multiple hesc lines to several potential reference materials, each having advantages in different areas of hesc research.

the greatest need for standards is in the area of gene-expression studies, as whole genome arrays are still expensive enough to discourage broad comparisons in any one laboratory, and the results are not easily compared between laboratories. for gene expression studies, we have created a pool of rna from three independent hesc lines. this pool shows great concordance of expression with individual normal hesc lines, as the correlation coefficients  with normal lines average  <dig> , or  <dig>  for genes expressed at high confidence levels. even if the line h <dig>  one of the lines in the pooled samples, is excluded, the r <dig> of highly confident expression for normal es lines averages  <dig> . thus, the pooled sample shows high colinearity with hesc lines of diverse origin. as the rna pool can be captured in the form of a cdna library relatively inexpensively, it can easily be widely disseminated.

alternatively, we have also provided data on embryonal carcinoma and karyotypically abnormal hesc lines, which are potential reference materials. as these lines are freely available, relatively inexpensive, and not subject to licensing and patent permissions, it is feasible to run these lines as internal/normalization controls. internal reference standards also allow normalization of data to posted datasets available worldwide. ntera- <dig> is an embryonal carcinoma line that expresses the same early embryo antigens now used to identify undifferentiated hesc. in global gene-expression studies, such as the data presented here, ntera- <dig> closely mimics hesc lines, showing an average r <dig> with the hesc pool of  <dig>  for all genes and  <dig>  for genes at high confidence. reference material in the form of rna or cdna could easily be produced in large lots from this cell line, for distribution around the world. the ntera- <dig> line also has advantages for antibody-based comparisons, as the line is well adapted to culture and grows quickly without feeder layers, attachment matrices, or the addition of any specialized growth factors other than serum. if the phenotype of ntera- <dig> were compared between laboratories, this last would probably be the major source of variation. thus, an effort could be made to introduce standardized serum-free conditions for the growth of ntera- <dig> and validate the reproducibility of its gene expression across laboratories in order to create an unlimited source of reference material for hesc.

while the undifferentiated phenotype of ntera- <dig> is quite similar to that of hescs, its behavior in differentiation paradigms is quite different. it shows little spontaneous differentiation in culture without induction by retinoic acid or other chemicals  <cit> . therefore, it may be more advantageous to have a reference material that is grown in conditions identical to normal hesc and shows a similar capacity for differentiation in vitro  <cit>  and in vivo  <cit> . the aneuploid line bg01v has these characteristics. compared with ntera- <dig>  the overall gene-expression profile of bg01v is more similar to undifferentiated hesc lines . the gene expression of differentiating cultures is being examined, but is much more likely to mimic differentiating hescs than ntera- <dig> would. for whole-cell studies of differentiation, bg01v is available at low cost. the growth conditions for bg01v, as for hesc in general, have not yet been standardized to ensure reproducible results across laboratories.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have found that the molecular characterization of hesc can be performed with minimal material, time, and expense. the series of tests presented here provides a method for frequent monitoring of many of the properties thought to be involved in stem-cell pluripotency. we believe that such characterization provides a useful set of results that will aid the cooperative international stem-cell effort, and will allow progress to be more rapid than in the past. we also hope that as cooperative standards become more widely accepted, commercial organizations will see fit to offer these as tools or kits to make the work of individual researchers easier.
