BACKGROUND
early embryonic development is initiated when mature oocytes  are fertilized by spermatozoa. maternal factors, such as mrnas, micrornas and proteins stored in the oocyte, provide the means of support for the first few days of development. the transition from a maternal to a zygotic control of development, called maternal to zygotic transition , and the activation of the embryonic genome involve chromatin structural modifications that take place during the first few embryonic cell cycles  <cit> . embryonic genome activation  sets the stage for later development  <cit> . changes in chromatin structure have been characterized throughout the transition from transcriptional incompetence to the minor activation of the zygotic genome at the 1-cell stage and through the major genome activation at the 2-cell stage in murine embryos  <cit> . in bovine embryos ega occurs at the 8- to 16-cell stage with extensive programming of gene expression. however, the regulation of chromatin remodeling during ega still remains a mystery.

chromatin remodeling is an extensive process occurring during early embryogenesis. an essential property of the embryonic chromatin structure is to prevent the access of the transcriptional machinery to all of the promoters in the genome. the expression of some genes may be mediated by chromatin remodeling proteins. chromatin remodeling complexes may change the overall pattern of expression of mammalian genes, allowing transcription factors and signaling pathways to produce different genomic transcriptional responses to common signals  <cit> . this is particularly important for preimplantation embryos starting cell differentiation cascades that will lead to tissue and organogenesis. these changes in chromatin structure generate activation of the transcriptional machinery and gene expression occurring during early embryo development, leading to a unique chromatin structure capable of maintaining totipotency during embryogenesis and differentiation during postimplantation development  <cit> .

the high mobility group nucleosomal  protein family is the only group of nuclear proteins that bind to the 147-base pair long nucleosome core particle with no sequence specificity  <cit> . hmgn proteins are present in the nuclei of all mammalian and most vertebrate cells at approximately 10% of the abundance of histones  <cit> . they bind as homodimers to the nucleosome and cause chromatin modifications that facilitate and enhance several dna-dependent activities, such as transcription, replication and dna repair. this protein family is composed of  <dig> members, hmgn <dig> , hmgn <dig> , and the most recently discovered hmgn <dig>  initially named trip <dig> for its ability to bind the thyroid hormone receptor  <cit> .

in the mouse hmgn <dig> and hmgn <dig> have been detected throughout oogenesis and preimplantation development and are progressively down-regulated throughout the entire embryo, except in cell types undergoing active differentiation  <cit> . reduction in the levels of hmgn <dig> and  <dig> mrna also occurs during myogenesis in rat, suggesting that down-regulation of hmgn mrna may be associated with tissue differentiation  <cit> . depletion of hmgn <dig> and hmgn <dig> in one- or two-cell embryos delays subsequent embryonic divisions. cells derived from hmgn1-/- mice have an altered transcription profile and are hypersensitive to stress  <cit> . experimental manipulations of the intracellular levels of hmgn <dig> in x. laevis embryos cause specific developmental defects at the post-blastula stages. furthermore, hmgn proteins regulate the expression of specific genes during x. laevis development  <cit> . several lines of evidence implicate hmgn <dig> and  <dig> in transcriptional regulation. chromatin containing genes that are actively being transcribed has two- to three times more hmgn <dig> and  <dig> compared with total chromatin  <cit> .

the human hmgn <dig> transcript produces two splice variants hmgn3a the long isoform with  <dig> amino acids, and hmgn3b with  <dig> amino acids that arises due to a truncation of the fifth exon. although no hmgn3b protein has been identified in the rat and cow, ests with high identity to it suggest that this splice variant may also exist in these species. the cow, mouse, and rat hmgn3a proteins share more than 81% identity with the human hmgn3a protein  <cit> . the role of hmgn3a has not been studied in mammalian development. our previous data show that hmgn3a is expressed at similar levels in oocytes and 8-cell bovine embryos  <cit> . we have detected high hmgn3a mrna levels in ivf produced bovine blastocysts. furthermore, hmgn3a was significantly higher in ivf derived blastocysts compared to blastocysts produced by somatic cell chromatin transfer , which had lower levels of hmgn3a transcript similar to those detected in somatic cells . although the exact function of hmgn3a during early embryonic development has not been determined, its role in facilitating chromatin modifications and enhancing transcription, replication, and dna repair is critical for early embryo development  <cit> .

another important mechanism in regulation of chromatin structure in the early embryo is mediated by nucleosome repositioning factors, which are atp-dependent chromatin-remodeling enzymes. nucleosome repositioning factors use energy released by atp hydrolysis to alter histone-dna contacts and reposition nucleosomes to create chromatin environments that are either open or compact. these factors do not involve sequence specific dna binding sites, but rather are recruited onto promoter regions by specific transcription factors. nucleosome repositioning factors typically exist as multi subunit protein complexes, like the swi/snf  atp-dependent chromatin remodeling complex  <cit> . swi/snf complexes are thought to regulate transcription of certain genes by altering the chromatin structure around them with their helicase and atpase activities  <cit> . in mammals, each swi/snf complex has any of two distinct atpases as the catalytic subunit of smarca <dig>  and smarca <dig>   <cit> . both atpases have important developmental functions. in primates, expression of both subunits remains constant and low throughout embryogenesis until the blastocyst stage  <cit> . in mouse embryos, smarca <dig> transcripts remain at stable levels throughout preimplantation development, while smarca <dig> transcripts remain low until the blastocyst stage, when its mrna levels increase  <cit> . in porcine embryos, smarca <dig> transcripts are most abundant in germinal vesicle  stage oocytes and decline progressively during embryo development to blastocyst stage  <cit> . mutant mice lacking the smarca <dig> gene dye at preimplantation while the smarca2-null mouse mutant is viable and shows a mild overgrowth phenotype  <cit> .

another member of the swi/snf family of proteins involved in chromatin remodeling is smarca <dig> , considered a global transcription activator and also called snf2l <dig>  like other swi/snf members, the smarca <dig> protein has a helicase atp-binding domain. however, since the rest of its motifs diverge from other members of the swi/snf family, it has been classified in the iswi  subfamily of atpases, together with smarca <dig>  decreasing levels of smarca <dig> were found during rhesus monkey embryogenesis from gv oocytes until blastocyst stage. the same study reported low levels of smarca <dig> throughout all stages of embryogenesis except for the 8-cell stage  <cit> .

members of the snf <dig> subfamily of swi/snf proteins are characterized by its seven motifs   <cit> . smarcal <dig>  is one of the snf <dig> members and shows high sequence similarity to the e. coli rna polymerase-binding protein hepa  <cit> . recent reports have linked mutations in the smarcal <dig> gene with schimke immunoosseous dysplasia , a human autosomal recessive disorder with the diagnostic features of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, renal dysfunction, and t-cell immunodeficiency  <cit> . the ability of smarcal <dig>  to interact primarily with nucleosomes was demonstrated using protein interaction microarrays. smarcal <dig> transcripts are ubiquitously expressed in different human and mouse tissues, suggesting a role in normal cellular functions or housekeeping activities, such as transcriptional regulation  <cit> . although no studies have reported the expression of smarcal <dig> during early embryogenesis in mammals, we previously detected a 7-fold increase of the smarcal <dig> mrna in 8-cell embryos as compared with mii oocytes by using oligonuclotide microarray gene expression analysis and real time pcr validation  <cit> .

additionally, studies on the swi/snf complex associated factor smarcc <dig> , a core subunit of the swi/snf complex, have highlighted the importance of the atpase subunits and the whole complex during embryogenesis. in the absence of smarcc <dig>  mouse embryonic development ceased during peri-implantation stages, indicating that smarcc <dig>  as well as the chromatin-remodeling process, plays an essential role in early mouse development  <cit> . smarcc <dig> mrna was found in high levels in gv stage rhesus monkey oocytes and at very low levels throughout early embryogenesis but was higher later at the hatched blastocyst stage  <cit> .

the limited availability of fully annotated bovine genes has been a limitation for bovine genomic studies. many bovine proteins are only partially annotated or are based on computational prediction. the objectives of this study were to determine transcript abundance of hmgn3a and smarcal <dig> in mature bovine oocytes and early bovine embryos, to perform comparative functional genomics analysis of these genes across mammals, including humans, annotate and analyze the conserved/non conserved regions of them on the comparative modeled structure.

RESULTS
hmgn3a and smarcal <dig> transcripts are highly expressed in bovine oocytes and early embryos
the mrna isolated from oocytes and early embryos exhibited typical ribosomal rna band ratio . blastocysts showed a ratio of 28s:18s bands closer to  <dig> , similar to somatic cells. using real time pcr, we demonstrated the presence of hmgn3a in bovine mii oocytes, 2–4-cell embryos, 8–16-cell embryos, morulae and blastocysts. hmgn3a transcript abundance was significantly lower in mii oocytes and 2-cell embryos compared to 8-cell, morula and blastocyst stage embryos . smarcal <dig> transcript abundance was similar in mii oocytes and 8-cell embryos. however we observed significantly higher levels of smarcal <dig> mrna in 2-cell embryos. smarcal <dig> transcripts decrease significantly in the morula and blastocyst stages . this result differs from our previous microarray and real-time pcr gene expression analysis, which showed that smarcal <dig> was expressed at significantly higher levels in 8-cell embryos compared to bovine oocytes  <cit> . this difference might be due to the fact that in the current study we have pooled 8- and 16-cell embryos where expression of smarcal <dig> transcripts might be decreasing at the 16-cell stage. the present results confirm the expression of hmgn3a and smarcal <dig> in the bovine oocyte and early embryo. their confirmed role in chromatin remodeling in other tissues, could suggest involvement of these proteins in the specialized chromatin remodeling process occurring during embryo development.

smarcc <dig>  expression during mouse oogenesis and preimplantation stages was studied using immunofluorescence and western blot assays. smarcc <dig> was present in the nuclei of oocytes during growth and maturation. following fertilization, smarcc <dig> was detected in higher levels in the male pronucleus compared to the female pronucleus. expression of smarcc <dig> was accompanied by expression of smarca <dig> and ini <dig>  other core subunit of the swi/snf complex. the expression of these chromatin remodeling factors could suggests a role for remodeling factors in chromatin structure and function during early development  <cit> . these findings suggest that although the iswi proteins are widely expressed and play important roles in promoting cellular proliferation and differentiation, they may not play a prominent role during blastocyst formation and may only become key factors during postimplantation life  <cit> .

comparative functional genomics analyses of hmgn3a across mammals
seven mammalian species were used in the construction of a hmgn3a phylogenetic tree . the percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test  is shown next to the branches. all positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated from the dataset. there were a total of  <dig> positions in the final dataset, of which  <dig> were parsimony informative. the most significant observation in multiple sequence alignment of hmgn3a was the insertion of alanine, in the fifth exon of the bos taurus protein, . several substitutions in the bovine sequence were shared by other mammals in the alignment.

hmgn3a constitutes a family of relatively low molecular weight non-histone components of about  <dig> amino acid residues. macaca mulatta and canis familiaris hmgn3a proteins have longer sequences with regions not shared with the other species. we focused on the regions of the protein shared by all species. also we showed other alanine substitutions in the alignment  .

comparative functional genomics analyses of smarcal <dig> across mammals
smarcal <dig> has four conserved domains . the first and the second are two harp  domains of approximately  <dig> residues long, with single-stranded dna-dependent atpase activity. the third conserved domain is a helicase like domain named snf <dig> n-terminal domain and the fourth is a helicase c-terminal domain  <cit> .

we used the whole smarcal <dig> protein sequences from  <dig> mammalian species to construct the phylogenetic tree . branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in less than 50% bootstrap replicates are collapsed. the percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap analysis  is shown next to the branches. all positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated from the dataset. there were a total of  <dig> positions in the final dataset, of which  <dig> were parsimony informative. we used each one of the four smarcal <dig> conserved domains to build separate multiple sequence alignments and construct separate phylogenetic trees for each domain . phylogenetic analysis shows that while homo sapiens, pan troglodytes, macaca mulatta are clustering together, equus caballus, canis familiaris and bos taurus have relatively distant position in the tree. rattus norvegicus and mus musculus separated these organisms in the tree. monodelphis domestica becomes the most distant species among  <dig> mammals in the tree.

for the first harp domain, the positions at which substitutions occur are highlighted in yellow  monodelphis domestica was the most distantly related mammal with respect to this domain. substitutions were observed in  <dig> positions. on the 4th substitution, glutamate, a medium size acidic amino acid was substituted by alanine, a small size hydrophobic amino acid in bos taurus. on the 8th substitution, while bos taurus, equus caballus, and canis familiaris have a serine, it is substituted for asparagine in pan troglodytes, and homo sapiens, and for arginine in macaca mulatta and rattus norvegicus. additionally mus musculus has a histidine, and monodelphis domestica has a lysine at this position. on the 10th substitution, while bos taurus, equus caballus, canis familiaris, and monodelphis domestica have an alanine, a small size hydrophobic amino acid, pan troglodytes, homo sapiens, and macaca mulatta have aspartate, a medium size acidic amino acid. both rattus norvegicus and mus musculus have phenilalanine at this position. for the second harp domain, there were  <dig> positions with amino acid substitutions in at least one of the species studied. these substitutions are highlighted in the alignment . again monodelphis domestica was the most distant species for this domain.

in phylogenetic tree analysis of harp <dig> domain, significantly higher bootstrap values were observed for rattus norvegicus, mus musculus, pan troglodytes and homo sapiens. in the second harp domain, high bootstrap values conserved only in rattus norvegicus and mus musculus. for both domains monodelphis domestica observed as the most distant mammalian among  <dig> species. when we compared first and second domain of harp in smarcal <dig> also there was a separation which can easily be identified between the group of canis familiaris, rattus norvegicus, mus musculus and the group of pan troglodytes, homo sapiens, and macaca mulatta. equus caballus was observed closer to the second group in the first harp domain.

the phylogenetic tree of snf2n which is the third domain of smarcal <dig> shows similar composition like the first two phylogenetic trees . but the most significant difference is canis familiaris is getting closer to bos taurus. for the last domain of smarcal <dig>  one of the clearest observations is lowering of bootstrap values between bos taurus and glean  <dig>  when it is compared to the other phylogenetic trees. also in the phylogenetic and sequence related analysis  <dig> parsimony informative sites detected and  <dig> of the sites are conserved among the species .

the multiple sequence alignment for the snf <dig> family n-terminal domain is shown in figure  <dig>  with monodelphis domestica as the most distant organism among the other mammals. positions with insertions and deletions are marked with stars. the first insertion comprises  <dig> additional amino acids  present only in the equus caballus, protein. there is a deletion of the amino acid arginine, present in all species, except for the ncbi bovine sequence. however the glean_ <dig> does not have the deletion. the amino acid threonine is also absent in both rattus norvegicus and mus musculus. the bovine ncbi sequence showed significant mutations of the third conserved domain marked in red on the alignment. however the sequenced official gene set for this protein  shows a higher homology to all species, differing in only  <dig> amino acids from the horse and human protein. these findings indicate sequencing errors in the currently available bovine smarcal <dig> protein. these errors will likely be corrected with the completion of the bovine genome annotation effort. the bovine helicase c-terminal domain protein shows a deletion  and several substitutions highlighted in red  that do not exist in glean_ <dig>  these observations point to the need for an update in smarcal <dig> protein sequence currently available at ncbi.

in addition to our analysis, we applied disparity index, id  <cit> , which measures the observed difference in evolutionary patterns for a pair of sequences. the disparity index for hmgn3a , did not show any significant pairs of species. the disparity index for each domain of smarcal <dig> is presented in figure  <dig>  in the first harp domain   <dig> pairs of species  were considered significant. the disparity index did not observed differences in evolutionary patterns for the second harp domain . there were  <dig> significant pairs in the snf <dig> n-terminal domain disparity index  . in the disparity index for the helicase c-terminal domain only the pair bos taurus-canis familiaris was significant .

annotation of hmgn3a and smarcal1
the official gene model for hmgn3a  was exactly identical to the ncbi protein  with  <dig> exons and a total of  <dig> amino acids. no changes were annotated for this protein.

the official gene model for smarcal <dig>  with  <dig> amino acids differed from the bovine ncbi protein  with  <dig> amino acids, particularly in  <dig> of the  <dig> exons. the official gene model for smarcal <dig> showed a higher level of sequence similarity to the human smarcal <dig> protein  compared to the available bovine smarcal <dig> protein at ncbi. these results are presented in table  <dig>  the differences between glean_ <dig> and np_ <dig>  were caused by an incorrect translation start and several sequencing errors that included  <dig> amino acid substitutions in exon three, one amino acid substitution in exon five, a sequencing error of  <dig> amino acids in exon ten, and a sequencing error of  <dig> amino acids in exon thirteen.

the official gene model shows a higher sequence homology to the human protein with more matches, shorter gaps, and fewer mismatches.

annotation of smarcal <dig> mrna showed that the first harp conserved domain in smarcal <dig> is composed of the last part of the first exon, the second exon and the first part of the third exon. the second harp conserved domain is composed of the end of the third exon, the fourth exon and the first part of the fifth exon. the third conserved domain, a helicase like domain named snf <dig> family n-terminal domain is composed of the end of the fifth exon and exons 6– <dig>  the fourth conserved domain, the helicase c-terminal domain is composed of the last part of the twelfth exon and exons  <dig> and  <dig>  the ncbi protein sequence for the helicase c-terminal domain may also contain several sequencing errors.

analysis of the conserved/non-conserved regions on the comparative modeled structure of smarcal1
since the protein structures for smarcal <dig> are available for helicase like and helicase domain, a comparative homology model was built on covering only these domains. the percentage similarity between template and protein sequence was 24%. depending on the multiple sequence alignments, all non-conserved residues were mapped on the modeled structure . snf2n and helicase c domains have nucleotide binding and atp binding residues. there are  <dig> residues responsible for nucleotide binding and  <dig> residues for atp binding which were retrieved from the literature  <cit> . these locations were mapped on the modeled structure. in our analysis we showed that all atp binding residues exist in the conserved regions. although threonine <dig> is among the residues that are responsible in nucleotide binding, falls into the non-conserved region in protein sequence. multiple alignment results show that in this specific location only one species  has variation which is proline . this substitution creates a difference in amino acid side chain polarity as well as hydrophobicity and size at that specific position.

CONCLUSIONS
in our analysis, the bovine hmgn3a and smarcal <dig> showed a higher degree of homology in all studied mammals. this high structural conservation highlights the importance of chromatin remodeling in the regulation of gene expression, particularly during early embryonic development. understanding the interactions between these proteins and their roles could improve our understanding of epigenetics in reproduction and disease. appropriate models for the study of chromatin remodeling proteins are essential to understanding this process, particularly in the case of diseases like schimke immunoosseous dysplasia , caused by a mutation in the smarcal <dig> gene. the greater similarities of the hmgn3a and smarcal <dig> proteins in human and bovine could suggest that more attention should be paid to a bovine model in the study of chromatin remodeling.
