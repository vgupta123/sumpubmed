BACKGROUND
in the region of basilicata, southern italy, anthrax outbreaks are typically isolated, self containing, and involve unvaccinated herbivores. epidemics are rare, and often occur when a rainy spring is followed by a dry summer  <cit> . during the spring and summer of  <dig>  as a result of such weather conditions in the pollino national park, an anthrax epidemic occurred. the affected area included  <dig> towns and involved  <dig> farms over an area of about  <dig> km <dig>  with a livestock population numbering about  <dig>  cattle and  <dig>  between sheep and goats. in  <dig> days,  <dig> cattle,  <dig> sheep, nine goats, eleven horses and eight red deer died . the anthrax epidemic evolved in three different phases. the first, counting  <dig> outbreaks, was the most critical. the second and third phases, with eight and six outbreaks, respectively, were less severe.

an additional outbreak preceded the epidemic by about one month  <cit> . several epidemiological factors may have contributed to this phenomenon. in this, as in other endemic areas, spores resulting from previous outbreaks may remain in the soil, thus facilitating the spread of anthrax among livestock through grazing  <cit> . in addition, anthrax infected carcasses are seldom removed. these carcasses are not isolated from the wild animals populating the pollino national park , resulting in a persistent source of infection in the environment  <cit> . furthermore, the abundance, at this time of year, of both biting  and non biting flies, which may act as mechanical vectors, could also have contributed to the persistence of anthrax  <cit> .

genetically, b. anthracis is a relatively homogeneous bacteria species. not surprisingly, then, discriminating between strains isolated from epidemiologically linked outbreaks is not an easy task  <cit> . different studies typed and differentiated b. anthracis isolates using single nucleotide polymorphisms  analysis and multiple locus vntr analysis   <cit> . in an epidemic, however, these methodologies are not likely to find genetic variation. the single nucleotide repeats  analysis described by stratilo et al. increases the likelihood of differentiating closely related isolates  <cit> . unfortunately, due to the presence of poly-a sequences, such polymorphisms are difficult to detect both with electorphoretic fragment analysis and with direct sequencing.

in this study, a retrospective molecular epidemiological investigation was performed, comparing 25-loci mlva and two snr analyses. we applied the modified snr technique described by kenefic et al.  as well as stratilo's original snr method , selecting the four loci with the highest diversity indices   <cit> . the snr primer panels used have two loci in common  and two distinct loci  . two different genetic analyzers  were used to verify results. this was done to address the technical difficulty in correct allele assignment.

RESULTS
mlva 25
the 25-loci mlva analysis classified all  <dig> b. anthracis isolates as belonging to a single genotype within cluster a <dig> a, as defined by lista et al.   <cit> .

snr analysis
snr analysis identified five sgts. of  <dig> isolates,  <dig> were classified as sgt- <dig>  compared to which four isolates, classified as sgt- <dig>  had a single-base pair deletion corresponding to locus cl33; sgt- <dig> and sgt- <dig>  each with a single isolate, exhibited insertions in loci cl <dig> and cl <dig>  respectively, while sgt- <dig>  again with a single isolate, differed from sgt- <dig> at three loci, with a five-base pair deletion at cl <dig>  an insertion into the cl <dig> locus, and a deletion at cl <dig> .

discussion
due to homoplasy, the high mutation rate of snr loci, estimated at 10- <dig> per generation in b. anthracis, does not allow a correct definition of phylogenetic relationships between different isolates  <cit> . snr is, however, able to detect genetic diversity between closely related strains as would occur in an epidemic  <cit> . our method of analysis involved the initial use of 25-loci mlva to define genetic relationships, and a subsequent investigation of genetic diversity between epidemic strains through snr analysis.

the 25-loci mlva assigned all strains to a single genotype within the cluster a <dig> a, evidence of their autochthonous origin. this particular genotype is frequently found in basilicata. the two snr analyses, str-mtd and ken-mtd, yielded the same result, identifying five sgts. the difference between these methods in terms of the amplicon sizes obtained for the common loci is a consequence of the use of different primer pairs. we found the ken-mtd more useful, as it allows for a multiplexed reaction and permits faster and more reliable detection of fragment sizes, owing to smaller amplicons sizes. moreover, the ken-mtd revealed an additional difference between sgt- <dig> and sgt- <dig>  an allele in the cl <dig> . polymorphisms were only discovered among the loci with the highest diversity indices   <cit> .

sgt- <dig>  the most common, was distributed across the epidemic area and present throughout the period under study. sgt- <dig> was also detected in soil from a grave site, and in the feces of wild boar collected in the same area, suggesting it is the probable ancestral strain. sgts 2- <dig> were rarer  and not present in all phases of the epidemic. these sgts could represent intra epidemic mutational steps descended from sgt- <dig>  sgt- <dig>  with three loci exhibiting fragment length polymorphism as compared to sgt- <dig>  was the first to be isolated in the affected area, but may have descended from a different, closely related previous outbreak .

the  <dig> b. anthracis strains are numbered  following the anthrax reference institute of italy coding system. for each outbreak, the date and phase of the epidemic is reported, as well as the number of animal deaths and their species. the subgenotype and gis coordinates of the site of sample collection are indicated for each isolated strain.

CONCLUSIONS
the epidemic under study was characterized by a single anthrax clone. although the epidemic spread over a large area, it involved extremely closely related isolates,  <dig> % of which  were identical across the highly discriminating snr markers. this epidemic was probably exacerbated by the absence of a careful monitoring of animals, making it possible for spores from a recent victim to spread in the environment. the mutational steps found in sgt- <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> may be associated with infective cycles subsequent to the first, while the presence of a more distantly related strain, sgt- <dig>  testifies to the evolutionary history of this lineage in this region. this divergent mutational clone may have originated from different outbreaks in the past. the high throughput genotyping system used in this study proved to be a useful tool for the study of closely related b. anthracis strains, and is therefore potentially valuable not only for the study of epidemics, but also for other contexts requiring the characterization of closely related strains such as the study of biological contaminations through environmental isolates or the forensic investigation of bioterrorist events.
