BACKGROUND
tree improvement programs are long-term and resource demanding endeavors requiring repeated cycles of selection, breeding and testing. most of conventional tree breeding programs face major challenges; including, long breeding cycles, large field experiments planted over vast territory, late expression of economic traits , and low to medium heritability of traits  <cit> . the phenotypic selection approach coupled with long testing phase often result in slow accumulation of genetic gain per unit time and cost  <cit> . plant breeders adopted marker-assisted-selection  to take advantage of the linkage disequilibrium  between genetic markers and quantitative trait loci  and realized the method’s potential to increase breeding efficiency  <cit> . similarly, tree breeders perceived mas as a means to reduce the time required for phenotypic selection, increasing selection intensity, and improving selection precision particularly for low heritability and late expressing traits as well as its ability to overcome major conventional breeding obstacles such as the long and costly breeding cycle  <cit> . however, mas faced several challenges; as most associations were limited to only specific genetic background due to the rapidly decaying ld in forest trees, the interaction of qtls effects with the genetic background, the genotype by environment  interaction, and the fluctuation of the alleles frequency over generations  <cit> . the complex nature of quantitative traits  <cit>  rendered mas ineffective in both animal and crop breeding and few successes mostly involving traits with simple inheritance  were reported  <cit> .

meuwissen et al.  <cit>  introduced genomic selection  as a method that collectively uses the genome-wide marker data in predicting the phenotype by estimating the genomic breeding values for each individual. the major advantage of gs is that it does not require the identification of the qtls or linked markers with target traits as all marker effects are estimated simultaneously and used to develop the prediction model for estimating genomic estimated breeding values  for each individual. thus, this method is suitable for selection of traits with complex genetic architecture as it does not rely on the identification of a single causal variant, rather it fits the genetic effects of all markers regardless of their known functional relevance  <cit> . in forest tree breeding context, gs has the ability to predict the phenotype for selecting elite genotypes at early age and developmental stage, thus substantially shortening the breeding cycle and increasing the selection differential, ultimately raising the genetic gain per unit time  <cit> . the time savings involve tree testing , which is not needed in the next few generations with gs being implemented in the conifer breeding program, thus providing 15– <dig> years anticipated savings  <cit> .

the development of next-generation-sequencing  technologies and the implementation of genetic markers from sequence data in quantitative genetics related to gs, the genomic best linear unbiased predictor   <cit> , and the unified single-step evaluation approach   <cit>  have created novel opportunities for breeding, including forest trees  <cit> . genotyping-by-sequencing   <cit> , of the ngs technologies, offers a promising opportunity in studying non-model species including those with large and complex genomes with no assembled reference sequence such as conifers  <cit> . gbs uses restriction enzymes to allow the sequencing of a reduced subset of the studied genome and the resulting fragments are dna barcoded to permit multiplexed sequencing. gbs has made genome-wide population studies possible due to the affordability of the method and its capability of resolving tens of thousands of markers scattered throughout the genome.

in this study, using gbs as a genotyping platform, we developed gs prediction models in a dataset of  <dig>  interior spruce trees representing  <dig> open-pollinated families replicated over three sites in british columbia , canada. white and interior spruce are one of the most economically important forest tree species in bc. interior spruce is a complex of white spruce  voss), engelmann spruce , and their hybrids and, because of their similar growing habitats and silvicultural requirements, they are often collectively treated as one complex  <cit> . while white spruce shows transcontinental distribution, the natural distribution of engelmann spruce is much more limited and scattered and in bc province is confined to the northern part of central bc. hybridization occurs mainly at mid elevations, where their distributions overlap. recently, extensive genetic and genomic resources became available for this species . the objectives of the present study were to: 1) evaluate the efficiency of gbs as a rapid genetic marker genotyping platform for gs studies, 2) investigate different imputation algorithms for gbs data on gs prediction accuracy, 3) compare two gs approaches  and generalized ridge regression ), 4) investigate the heterogeneous gxe effect on gs prediction accuracy in space, and 5) use pca in the comparisons of multi- vs. single-trait gs prediction models.

RESULTS
genotyping, missing data imputation, and selection of imputation method
in this study,  <dig>  38-year-old interior spruce trees  voss x picea engelmannii parry ex engelm.) originating from  <dig> open-pollinated families selected for their superior growth traits were sampled from the progeny test trial planted on three sites,  aleza lake,  prince george tree improvement station , and  quesnel. a cost-effective ngs technology, genotyping-by-sequencing , was employed for genotyping a 20gb unassembled genome such as spruce. after two 48-multiplexed sequencing passes, a total of  <dig> , <dig>  good barcoded reads was generated, and the median of read depth per site was at  <dig>  . tassel uneak snp calling pipeline was used to determine snp polymorphism for these  <dig>  spruce trees, resulting in a large genotype table of  <dig> , <dig> snps  <cit> . typical to gbs, a low coverage sequence platform, many markers tended to have missing data even after the repeated sequencing of all studied trees . from the identified  <dig> , <dig> snps, the applied imputation methods and filtering  used produced genotyping files ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>   snps . imputation accuracy ranges from  <dig>   to  <dig>  . on average, svd with  <dig> iterations produced the best accuracy in the four currently existing methods: mi, svd, em and knn. using k’s  from family versus non-family members, accuracy for knn-fam imputation ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . in general, including more family members resulted in higher accuracy ; however, imputation accuracy remained unchanged , when the number of non-family members that was included was larger than the family size. the best imputation accuracy gained was at k1 =  <dig> and k2 =  <dig>  which represented the k values used in this study for imputing the whole snp table . as a result, we chose knn-fam over knn of troyanskaya et al.  <cit>  due to its slight superiority in accuracy. the snp table imputed with this method is referred to as knn-fam.table  <dig>

the selection of specific imputation methods for genomic selection analyses were restricted to the method with greater gs accuracies within the same percentage of missing data class . for the 30% missing data, the em-30% produced greater accuracy than mi-30%, similarly for the 60% missing data, the knn-fam-60% and svd-60% produced better accuracies comparing to mi-60%; however, the knn-fam-60% was superior to svd-60% . this comparison was done based on gs prediction accuracies produced for the two gs models and the seven studied traits for both single- and multi-site scenarios .

trait heritabilities
using genotypes resulting from the em-30% algorithm imputed data, the narrow-sense heritabilities of the traits estimated from the pedigree  and genomic best linear unbiased predictors  produced several broad generalizations that include: 1) single- and multi-site heritabilities were higher for ablup than those from their gblup counterparts, 2) multi-site heritabilities were lower than that of a single site for both ablup and gblup, 3) trait heritabilities varied among sites for both ablup and gblup; however, the differences were lower for the gblup than that of the ablup, 4) the quesnel site produced higher heritabilities than pgtis and aleza lake, yet they have some overlapping ranges, and 5) standard error estimates of heritabilities obtained from ablup were higher than those from gblup for single- and multi-site . lower gblup heritabilities were expected as ablup tended to inflate the estimates as the pedigree based analysis assumptions are often violated due to mating pattern, relatedness built-up due to population history, and inability to separate common environment effect from genetics.table  <dig>

prediction accuracy for different gs models and imputation methods
the accuracy of gs models  in predicting the gebv were evaluated for the seven studied traits using all imputation methods  and over the four cross-validation scenarios: 1) within each individual site, 2) cross-site , 3) within multi-site , and 4) the multi-site population in predicting individual site .

within site gs accuracies
across all imputation methods , the rr-blup produced higher within site gebv accuracies than the grr . in general, the rr-blup produced higher accuracies than the grr  and this was also mirrored by their standard error estimates . within the 30% missing data imputation methods, the em-30% produced greater accuracy than mi-30% for all traits for rr-blup  and grr  . the 60% missing data imputation methods produced similar gs prediction and confirmed the superiority of the rr-blup over grr and additionally highlighting the better accuracies for knn-fam-60% compared to mi-60% and svd-60% .table  <dig>

multi-sites gs accuracies
unlike within site cross-validation, testing the applicability of a gs model for a specific site to predict the gebv of other sites generally produced lower accuracies for both models  . this is expected due to the gxe interaction even when the three sites are located within one breeding zone ). for simplicity, in this section we will restrict the cross-sites comparisons to the imputation method with the highest number of snps ), and the gs model with highest accuracies ). over the seven studied traits, the rr-blup model produced cross-site validation accuracies ranging from  <dig>  and  <dig>  when pgtis was used to predict the gebv of aleza lake ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for 2→ <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  for pgtis to predict quesnel ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for 3→ <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  for 2→ <dig>  and  <dig>  and  <dig>  for 3→ <dig> . the estimated type-b genetic correlations between sites mimicked the trend observed for cross sites gs accuracy with their pearson-product-moment correlations ranging between  <dig>  and  <dig>   over the seven studied traits for the knn-fam-60% imputation method .figure  <dig> accuracy of cross-population gs prediction models ) for seven growth and wood quality traits for interior spruce. sites are prince george tree improvement station , quesnel, and aleza lake. traits are ht: height in m; dbh: diameter at breast height in cm; vol: stem volume in m3; vdir: acoustic velocity in km/s; wdres: resistance to drilling; wdx-ray: wood density in kg/m <dig> using x-ray densitometry; moed: dynamic modulus of elasticity. dash and solid lines represent type b correlation and prediction accuracy, respectively.



within multi-site gs accuracies
similar to within site assessment, the within multi-site cross-validation produced higher gebv accuracies for rr-blup as compared to grr and this increase in accuracy persisted across all 30% and 60% missing data imputation methods . comparisons between imputation methods revealed that em-30% and knn-fam-60% produced better accuracies . again, we will restrict the gebv accuracy comparisons to the knn-fam-60% imputation method as it uses the largest number of snps . on average and across the seven studied traits, gs accuracies ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig>  for both rr-blub and grr . the span of this range is far greater than the one observed within sites and cross-sites validation . these estimates represent the most realistic accuracies as they accommodated the gxe interaction and, furthermore, were produced with a large training population size .table  <dig>

single- vs. multi-site accuracies
when the meta-population was used to predict the gebv for each individual site, the observed accuracies were high with aleza lake producing the highest accuracies  followed by quesnel  and pgtis which produced the lowest accuracies  . these accuracies are higher than those observed for the cross-site validation .table  <dig>

multi-trait gs prediction models
the first three principle components, pca1- <dig>  collectively accounted for 86% of the total phenotypic variation and individually accounted for  <dig>   <dig>  and 17%, respectively. pca <dig> produced significant  loading for all the studied traits and was positive for height  , diameter at breast height  , and acoustic velocity   and negative for wood density using x-ray densitometry   and wood density using resistance to drilling  . pca <dig> produced interesting results with significant  and positive loadings for ht , vdir , and wdx-ray . similarly, pca <dig> produced significant  and positive loadings for ht , dbh , wdx-ray  and wdres . the fact that growth and wood quality traits produced significant and positive loadings, even if it is for pca <dig> and pca <dig>  is interesting as it creates concurrent selection opportunities for yield and wood quality traits that are commonly known to be negatively correlated. the two gs models produced high prediction accuracies for pca <dig> with  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for rr-blup and grr, respectively. similar results were observed for pca  <dig>  and pca <dig>  using the multi-site gs model.

discussion
gbs and imputation methods
the utilization of ngs technology, and gbs in particular, provides a low cost opportunity for genomic studies for non-model species  <cit> . in the present study, gbs produced exceedingly large number of snps ; however, the low coverage nature of the technique has substantially reduced the available snps for analyses due to missing data. missing data could also result from either the absence of the restriction site in the genomic sequence or due to technical issues associated with dna digestion or pcr amplification  <cit> . out of the five imputation methods used, the expectation maximization  and the newly developed half-sib family-based k-nearest neighbor  method resulted in  <dig>  and  <dig>  snps, respectively, and produced the greatest accuracies . we used the em-30% imputation method in estimating the trait heritabilities employing the gblup approach  <cit> , while all described imputation methods were used to evaluate the gs models across all described scenarios. we believe that the higher gebv accuracies attained from the knn-fam imputation method are attributable to the method’s capacity of recovering resemblance among individuals within families. in addition, knn-fam method proportionately weights family structure and the underlying ld of snps, which is also likely contributing to the slightly higher predictability due to its strength of simultaneously capturing identical-by-state with the variants in ld with the causal genes  <cit> .

heritability estimates
treating the offspring from open-pollinated families as half-sibs is often associated with inflated heritability estimates, resulting in an exaggeration of the expected genetic gain  <cit> . in the present study, heritability estimates obtained from the ablup were higher than those from the gblup , highlighting the advantages of incorporating genomic information in standard quantitative genetic analyses  <cit>  to obtain realistic estimates of breeding values and genetic gain .

our results are similar to those reported for another open-pollinated white spruce progeny trial in québec, canada  <cit> .while heritability estimates were population-specific, slight differences in gblup-based heritability estimates for wood density  and height  were observed between the two studies   <cit> . additionally, our results suggest that the trait heritability has only limited effect on the prediction accuracy  as diameter at breast height  and stem volume  showed high multi-site rr-blup predictability despite their low heritability estimates , results consistent with those reported for loblolly pine   <cit> .

gs models
gs models suffer from the “large p, small n” problem, where the number of predictor effects p exceeds by far the number of observations n . a variety of statistical methods were proposed to handle this issue and they can be classified into three major categories: shrinkage models, bayesian methods , and semi- or non-parametric methods such as support vector regression and random forest regression. those methods are different in their assumptions regarding the genetic architecture of the tested traits  <cit> . rr-blup, the most common shrinkage model, assumes that the trait is controlled by many genes each with small effects, thus is suitable for traits following the infinitesimal model  <cit> . rr-blup assumes that all marker effects are random, normally, and identically distributed and have a common variance, thus all the effects will be equally shrunken toward zero  <cit> . this approach was described previously by meuwissen et al.  <cit>  and termed snp-blup. in gs and genome wide association studies , it is not realistic to use common shrinkage effects for all fitted snps across the genome as not all markers will be linked to functional genes and not all gene effects are normally distributed  <cit> . to overcome this assumption, the bayesian methods were developed to provide more flexibility in modeling oligogenic traits   <cit> ; however, these methods are computationally demanding  <cit> . a new, fast, deterministic, and flexible ridge regression method was suggested by shen et al.  <cit>  known as the generalized ridge regression . the main difference between rr-blup and grr is that a snp-specific shrinkage will be used instead of the common shrinkage effect  <cit> , which is more realistic and more suitable to model oligogenic traits and represents a viable alternative to bayesian models  <cit> .

our results showed that grr produced either similar or even lower prediction accuracies as compared to rr-blup, which indicates that marker selection by giving different degree of penalization through the application of different shrinkage effects is inadequate for the tested traits. this provides evidence that the tested traits  follow the infinitesimal model. moreover, experimental results in both plants and animals suggested that rr-blup provides the best adjustment/compromise between the computational effort and the prediction efficiency  <cit> . this supports the notion that most of the economically important traits are complex and quantitative in nature . for example, in loblolly pine, resende et al.  <cit>  evaluated rr-blup and three bayesian models across  <dig> traits related to growth, development, and fusiform rust resistance and the resulting prediction accuracies were marginally different across the four models, except for rust resistance, an oligogenic trait, where the bayes a and c models resulted in moderately larger performance than rr-blup.

cross-validation
the multi-site cross-validation produced higher prediction accuracies as compared to single-sites  as the multi-site training population is three times larger than any of the single-site models, resulting in more accurate estimation of marker effects and this is consequently reflected in higher prediction accuracy and precision  <cit> . previous gs studies conducted on plant and animal populations clearly demonstrated the role of training population size on prediction accuracy and illustrated the importance of the training population size as compared to the number of markers used in the models, thus supporting the present study results  <cit> . in forestry context, our results are also consistent with prediction accuracies obtained for growth and wood quality attributes in loblolly pine and eucalyptus  <cit> . however, comparing the prediction accuracies between our study and those from the québec white spruce open-pollinated progeny trial is of interest as the experimental settings were somewhat similar  <cit> . height, wood density, and dynamic modulus of elasticity were common traits between the two studies; however, their prediction accuracies were lower than in the present study . in general, the lower prediction accuracies in the québec study across all the traits compared to our and other tree species studies, is mainly due to the considerably larger number of tested families  which resulted in higher ne . it is also worth mentioning that we used the ebv as opposed to the raw phenotype in training our gs models; this could have also contributed to the observed differences.

cross-site validation
the economic and ecological importance of interior spruce to british columbia promoted thorough understanding of the various ecological regions of the species and subsequently  <dig> unique seed planning zones  were identified . to date, most forestry gs studies were conducted within the confines of a single “environment model” similar to those gs studies conducted in animal breeding programs where the assumption of a common environment was invoked. the assumption of “common environment” is not suitable in forestry as estimates of gxe, even within a single breeding zone, are high  <cit>  and this motivated breeders to evaluate the performance of a specific genotype or family across different environments to identify generalists for their inclusion in seed production populations  <cit> . for the successful implementation of gs in tree breeding, it is essential that gs models remain accurate across sites, at least within the dedicated breeding zone. only two out of the published four gs studies in forest tree tested gxe interaction, these include loblolly pine  <cit>  and white spruce  <cit> . in the present study, we used data from three sites within the prince george breeding zone and the observed prediction accuracies of a single site to predict another site were generally low . the observed reduced prediction accuracies across sites were lower than those obtained from the white spruce and loblolly pine studies. thus, it is important to pay considerable attention to the structure of the training population; hence the developed models reflect the underpinning forces affecting trait expression and their response to sites heterogeneities.

multi-trait gs prediction models
gs models are trait-specific and do not lend themselves to multi-trait selection as does index selection method which maximizes the correlation between the index score of an individual and its breeding value  <cit> . yet, selection indices require prior knowledge about the economic value of the traits for proper scaling before optimum phenotypic weights can be estimated. the use of principle component analysis offered an opportunity to handle a set of correlated variables by reducing the dimensionality to a set of uncorrelated ones . negative genetic correlations between yield and wood quality traits are commonly observed  <cit>  and the results from pc <dig> which accounts for 44% of the total variation confirmed these observations. however, while yield and wood quality are known to act in antagonizing fashion, the results based on pc <dig> and pc <dig>  albeit collectively accounting for 42% of the total variation, created interesting opportunities for the concurrent selection for both traits without any adverse effect associated with the known negative correlations. it seems that pc <dig> and pc <dig> accessed different combinations of snps  that work in the same direction. while we did not consider any prior economic knowledge for weighing in constructing the pcs, the results from pc2- <dig> clearly demonstrated that it is  also possible to artificially co-select such attributes that are commonly known to be negatively correlated in the same positive direction. considering economic weights for traits during constructing selection indices can result in changing the magnitude of genetic correlation among these traits as a consequence of selection. this change in genetic correlation is expected to change snp effects and thus frequent training is required for gs model to be effective over generations. finally, our objective of using pca is to offer a simple method that accounts for the inter-relation  between the studied traits and provide an opportunity for further expansions that consider economic weights.

ablup vs. gblup elite genotype selection comparison
the observed genetic gain differences between the ablup and gblup across all co-ancestry penalties were not surprising as heritability, breeding value of an individual, and genetic gain estimates are expected to be higher in open-pollinated populations due to the ablup inability to ascertain the true genetic relationship among offspring  <cit> . on the other hand, gblup relies on estimating the realized kinship which provides a more accurate ascertainment of the genealogical relationships among members of an open-pollinated family and thus, resulting in more realistic gain estimates due to adjustment for mendelian sampling term  <cit> . our results are similar to those reported in the québec white spruce study as they consistently produced higher gains from pedigree- vs. marker-based methods  <cit> .

it should be pointed out that the bulmer effect  would be similar for ablup and gblup and thus the response to selection for both methods will be similarly affected irrespective of the breeding values estimation method used  <cit> . if genomic selection effectively reduces generation interval, then in the forestry context, a relatively smaller reference  population size is needed to attain the same response to selection from larger traditional population . conversely, if generation turnover is not possible, then larger training population size is required, therefore defeating gs goals. bastiaansen et al.  <cit>  found similar response to selection for gblup and ablup but the former accumulated lower level of inbreeding and consequently higher genetic variance than the latter.

genomic selection in forestry
open-pollinated family testing is a formidable and economically viable option for screening a larger number of candidate parents without the development of “structured pedigree” that represents the backbone of most conventional tree breeding methods. the simplicity of the method made it an attractive first step before starting a full-blown tree improvement program. indeed, this was the case for the new zealand radiata pine  breeding program as open-pollinated testing provided a quick and inexpensive screening method  <cit>  and subsequently the selected parents were included in a full pedigree-based breeding program  <cit> . however, the commonly used assumption of treating open-pollinated offspring as half-sib family is by far the greatest drawback of this method as most genetic parameters  are upwardly biased and this was clearly demonstrated in many studies including the present one  <cit> . the introduction of genomic data  has provided the means to overcome this drawback and the genealogical relationship among open-pollinated family members is clearly and accurately ascertained. at present, many open-pollinated family testing trials have reached an advanced age and are often abandoned, though they could provide badly needed information for late expressed traits that could not be obtained from younger conventional trials. the present study and that of beaulieu at al.  <cit>  provided examples of producing yield and wood quality attributes data with unprecedented accuracy and this became possible through the integration of genomic information in the quantitative genetic analyses .

in the present study, the accuracy of predicting breeding values varied across the different studied population scales with within multi-site being the highest and cross sites being the lowest . the high within multi-site gs prediction accuracies offer an opportunity to obtain reliable results for difficult traits such as wood density and yield and points towards considering “old” open-pollinated tests as a valuable source for information. the developed prediction models could be used for selecting elite genotypes with unprecedented selection intensity for their inclusion in future seed production populations, and this can be accomplished without the creation of a single cross.

in the present study, gbs successfully provided the information for genomic-based quantitative genetics analyses at reasonable cost. to our knowledge, this study represents the first large-scale use of gbs in a forest tree species known to a have complex genome and for which no reference sequence has been assembled yet . it is noteworthy to mention that this study was initiated before the release of norway and white spruce genome sequences  <cit> . however, as the assemblies of the two spruce genomes are not anchored and ordered along the chromosomes, there is little advantage over de novo snp markers.

CONCLUSIONS
the results reported here suggest that gbs can be used as a genotyping platform for the application of gs in forestry. the utilization of proper imputation algorithms is needed to overcome the commonly observed problem of missing data with gbs. greater gs prediction accuracies were obtained for rr-blup as compared to grr indicating that the studied traits follow the infinitesimal model. greater accuracies were obtained for multi-site gs model and points to the inherent lack of reliability for cross-site prediction. the utilization of principle component analysis as a multi-trait gs approach was proven effective in dealing with negatively correlated traits.
