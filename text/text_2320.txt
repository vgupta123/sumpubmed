BACKGROUND
the remarkable amount of normal variability in the architecture of the central nervous system  has a substantial genetic component composed, in part, of multiple polymorphic genes each of which has a small effect on phenotypic variation. quantitative trait locus  mapping is an efficient means of associating positions in the genome with variation in a phenotype  <cit> . such quantitative genetic approaches applied in recombinant inbred  strains of mice have been used to map and characterize genes responsible for heritable variation in a number of cns morphologic phenotypes including ventricular size  <cit> , hippocampal structure, size, and cell number  <cit> , and cerebellar size and structure  <cit> . ri strains possess several advantages in qtl analysis. firstly, ri strains are fully inbred and multiple individuals can be phenotyped to derive an accurate strain average. secondly, many of the ri strains have been densely genotyped, eliminating this often costly and time-consuming step.

recently, quantitative genetic methods were applied to characterize the heritability of cortex characteristics in inbred and ri strains of mice  <cit> . li and colleagues began examining the underlying genetic basis of variability in the size of barrel subfields of the primary somatosensory  cortex in adult mice  <cit> . woolsey and van der loos  <cit>  first described the organization of cell aggregates, called barrels, in layer iv of the mouse si and showed that these barrels represent the vibrissae and sinus hairs on the contralateral face  <cit> . these barrels are organized in a continuous manner from the posterior medial region of si, designated as the posterior medial barrel subfield , associated with the representation of the large mystacial vibrissae, to the anterior regions designated as the anterior lateral barrel subfield  associated with the representation of the sinus hairs on the face and snout. barrels increase in number while decreasing in size from the pmbsf to the albsf. further studies led to the characterization of additional barrel fields associated with forepaw and hindpaw representations  <cit> .

li and colleagues took advantage of the barrel model by quantitatively comparing the cortical representation of the vibrissae representation, specifically the combined areas of the pmbsf/albsf, between common inbred strains and between  <dig> bxd ri strains  <cit> . to generate these ri strains, two progenitor strains, c57bl/6j and dba/2j, were intercrossed and subsequent generations were inbred. the resulting panels of inbred strains have fixed homozygous genotypes at each locus, with parental  alleles segregated among the strains  <cit> . in addition to finding significant variation in pmbsf/albsf area, suggesting that this phenotype is a polygenic trait, we reported two markers on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> that were suggestively linked to total pmbsf/albsf area in  <dig> bxd strains. however, it was unknown how robust these results would be when additional strains were phenotyped and measurements were restricted to the well-defined pmbsf area. the present work addresses these questions by examining the pmbsf area in  <dig> strains of bxd mice. because pmbsf/albsf area was previously shown to be highly heritable  <cit> , we focused on maximizing the number of strains. in this study, we detected a suggestive qtl on the proximal arm of chromosome 4; to date, this is the first qtl associated with normal variation in pmbsf area. we further identified carbonic anhydrase related protein  <dig>  as a potential candidate gene that may modulate pmbsf area variability.

RESULTS
pmbsf organization
the pmbsf was examined in co stained tissue in  <dig> mice from  <dig> strains  . the pmbsf consists of five well-defined anterior-posterior running rows  each representing one large mystacial vibrissae on the contralateral face. rows a and b typically contain four barrels, while rows c-e contain five barrels. four straddler barrels  form the posterior border of the pmbsf. together, a total of  <dig> barrels form the pmbsf and the area defining these barrels was measured in the present study. it is worth noting that in a number of cases  one barrel from either the a or b or both rows were found missing in one or both hemispheres, but the general overall pmbsf pattern was not disrupted. furthermore, there was no significant difference  between total pmbsf areas of hemispheres with asymmetrical number of barrels. several examples of the pmbsf area are shown in figure  <dig> 

values are given as average ± s.e.m

heritability
broad-sense heritability  of pmbsf area was calculated using raw data for all phenotyped cases. the computed value for pmbsf area variation was approximately 58% . this confirmed previous findings where similar heritability values  were calculated for combined pmbsf/albsf using only  <dig> strains  <cit> . this similarity in heritability further substantiates our previous study that the use of a small number of animals per strain  is appropriate for mapping purposes given a large number of phenotyped strains. as expected, pmbsf area adjusted for brain weight showed a lower heritability of approximately 41% .

brain weight and body weight
brain and body weight values of all phenotyped cases correlate. pearson's product-moment correlation showed that brain and body weights correlate at r =  <dig>  . group mean correlation of brain and body weights for all strains was r =  <dig>  .

parental strain differences
pmbsf areas of dba/2j and c57bl/6j were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm <dig> and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm <dig>  respectively, making the dba/2j larger by  <dig> %. this difference was not statistically significant . however, when the data were adjusted for brain weight, there was a significant  difference between dba/2j and c57bl/6j  making the dba/2j larger by  <dig> %. total brain weight of dba/2j animals was significantly  smaller than that of c57bl/6j animals . in comparison, body weights of the two strains did not vary with dba/2j =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g and c57bl/6j =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g.

sex and pmbsf area
the majority of strains used contained at least one male and one female; however, same sex mice were used in seven strains . animal sex did not show a strong relationship to pmbsf area and thus was not used as a predictor of pmbsf area. using a pearson's product-moment correlation, sex correlated with pmbsf area . a simple regression analysis confirmed the significance of this relationship where we failed to reject the null hypothesis. the regression also showed that sex only accounted for approximately  <dig> % of the variance seen in pmbsf area .

age and pmbsf area
animals used in this study fell within a small age range:  <dig> –  <dig> days old. simple correlation analysis among all phenotyped individuals showed age to be moderately correlated with pmbsf area . likewise, age and pmbsf area of group means correlated, albeit with less significance . a simple regression analysis revealed that age accounts for approximately  <dig> % of total pmbsf area variability . however, this may be misleading given that age was also coincidently correlated with strain . for this reason, age was excluded as a factor when modeling pmbsf area variability.

effects of body and brain weights on pmbsf area
body weight correlated significantly with total pmbsf area in all individual cases at a modest level . approximately  <dig> % of variance in pmbsf area may be accounted for by body weight . similarly, brain weight also correlated significantly with pmbsf area . however, unlike body weight, brain weight accounted for about  <dig> % of the variance seen in pmbsf area .

pmbsf area variability and data modeling
our results showed a 33% difference between pmbsf area means of the largest and smallest bxd ri strain measurements . we utilized direct correlations between pmbsf area and other variables to explore genetic relationships. a linear model was utilized to distinguish among the most significant factors for the prediction of pmbsf area variability.

three factors were taken into consideration in the linear model: sex, body weight, and brain weight. strain was excluded as a predictor because it is the genetic factor that we hypothesized to account for pmbsf area variability. using all individual cases, we observed that sex was the least significant factor  in predicting pmbsf area variability; sex was thus the first factor removed from the model. next, body weight became the least significant factor  and was therefore removed. brain weight remained a significant factor both in the presence of sex and body weight and of course as the last remaining factor as well . this was consistent with the finding that brain weight accounts for approximately  <dig> % of the variability in pmbsf area, the largest percentage of variance as predicted by other factors. we therefore adjusted pmbsf area for brain weight and used the adjusted values for qtl mapping.

qtl modulating brain and body weights
in this study, all qtl mapping was completed using only bxd ri strains . to further confirm that our pmbsf area qtls are not due to variations in brain and body weights, we mapped the qtls for these traits on webqtl using raw data. figure 2a shows a qtl map of body weight using raw data. clearly, this map does not show any significant qtls. it should be noted however, that there was a signal near the suggestive threshold on chromosome  <dig>  however the location is remote from the pbmsf area qtl as discussed below. the qtl map of brain weight using raw data is shown in figure 2b. again, only a couple of near-suggestive outcomes were observed with one on chromosome  <dig>  none of the detected signals, including the one on chromosome  <dig> for brain weight, overlapped with our proposed pmbsf area suggestive qtl.

qtl modulating pmbsf area
we used our  <dig> bxd strains to map total pmbsf area qtl. both raw data and adjusted values of pmbsf area were utilized for mapping in order to test whether our data modeling affected position of the identified pmbsf area qtl. by examining the simple regression qtl map of raw pmbsf area , we immediately noticed two suggestive qtls, one on the proximal arm of chromosome  <dig> and the other on chromosome  <dig>  in addition, a couple of other signals  were also observed to cross the suggestive threshold. when pmbsf area was adjusted for brain weight, the suggestive qtl on chromosome  <dig> remained largely unchanged, in terms of its significance and its location . however, most of the other suggestive qtls observed in the raw data map had diminished signals, in particular those on chromosomes  <dig> and x. marker regression analysis using webqtl revealed four loci with highly suggestive lrs values, all at  <dig>  . the detected loci are: rs <dig>  rs <dig>  gnf <dig> . <dig>  rs <dig> 

interval regression mapping  of chromosome  <dig> with  <dig> permutations and bootstrap analysis shows a detailed view of the total pmbsf area suggestive qtl. bootstrap analysis is a method of testing the reliability of the peak qtl signal by randomly producing a new sample from the original data set. the newly created sample set contains the same number of cases as the original set, however one or more of the cases may be duplicated and/or removed. the bootstrap analysis histogram at right in figure 3c shows that the suggestive qtl is regenerated at the same location approximately 54% of the time, further suggesting the reliability of the signal within chromosome  <dig> 

the qtl signal spans a relatively small region, from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb. although there are no obvious multiple qtls, we tested for interaction among different loci given that there are a number of suggestive loci. both lrs interaction and lrs full pair-scan analyses revealed no significant two-loci epistatic interactions.

candidate genes
we detected  <dig> genes that lie under the chromosome  <dig> interval of  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb . we utilized a  <dig> -lod support interval around the peak value of the suggestive qtl to derive the  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb range. in order to increase the likelihood of detecting potential candidate genes, we first prioritized the genes by the number of snps present within each gene. biological relevance was the next factor that went into consideration when identifying potential candidates. with these criteria in mind, we identified two genes of particular interest that are discussed below . car <dig> is a cis-acting gene whereas rab <dig> is a trans-acting gene.

correlative analysis
microarray data analysis is a powerful method that may be used in conjunction with qtl analysis to detect genes of interest that may be expressed in remote regions of the genome. we used rna expression profiles of whole brain from one of the genenetwork databases  pdnn) to detect genes of interest that are correlated with our adjusted pmbsf area phenotype. an initial correlation query resulted in the detection of  <dig> transcripts from the entire genome that were correlated with adjusted pmbsf area. although we phenotyped  <dig> bxd ri strains, the highest number of strains that was detected by the correlation analysis was n =  <dig> 

after searching through the  <dig> transcripts, we detected two genes of particular interest, adenylate cyclase  <dig>  and growth associated protein  <dig> , that have a significant biological relationship to pmbsf area. the first gene, adcy <dig>  is correlated at r =  <dig>   with a high mean expression of  <dig> . adcy <dig> is found on chromosome  <dig> of the mouse starting at  <dig>  mb. the second gene of interest, growth associated protein  <dig> , is correlated with total pmbsf area  and is found on chromosome  <dig> starting at  <dig>  mb.

we took advantage of previously published phenotypes by searching for traits that correlated with car <dig>  one of our potential candidate genes. using the online allen brain atlas  <cit> , we observed that car <dig> was highly expressed in cerebellar purkinje cells. car <dig> has strong negative correlations with volume of cns regions in bxd ri strains, including basolateral amygdala, hippocampus, cerebellum, and striatum.

discussion
synopsis
this study was an extension of our previous work  <cit>  in which the total pmbsf/albsf area was examined in four common inbred strains and  <dig> bxd ri strains of mice. in the present study, we collected data from a total of  <dig> bxd ri strains of mice, two parental strains, and one f <dig> hybrid. we examined a number of phenotypes including body weight, brain weight, and total pmbsf area in a total of  <dig> cases. this is the first time that such a wide array of bxd ri strains have been used for mapping a qtl of any cortical area. we found wide continuous variations of total pmbsf area among the bxd ri strains with a 33% difference between highest and lowest values. using previously established methods of qtl analysis, we identified a suggestive qtl on the proximal arm of chromosome  <dig> linked to total pmbsf area. this locus contained two interesting candidate genes: car <dig> and rab <dig>  in addition, correlation analysis with a whole brain microarray expression database revealed a number of highly correlated genes throughout the genome including adenylate cyclase  <dig> , a gene known to disrupt barrel organization of mouse somatosensory cortex  <cit> , and gap <dig>  a gene previously reported to be involved in barrel formation during mouse development  <cit> .

technical concerns
one of the most difficult aspects of examining the barrel field in the somatosensory cortex arises from the flattening process of the hemispheres. only two experimenters performed the cortex flattening process , with one  conducting the process in 32/ <dig>  of the bxd ri strains. all reconstructions and measurements were conducted by a single experimenter  to reduce measurement biases. we also selected the pmbsf to measure since this subfield is the largest, contains well-delineated barrels, and suffers less distortion in the flattening process. this is particularly important, because when the pmbsf and albsf were previously examined  <cit> , the albsf was often distorted in the flattening process, since the most anterior barrels within the albsf were located over a major curvature in the cortex. therefore, we focused exclusively on the pmbsf in the present study.

in our data set, there was a significant correlation between age and strain, and thus we were unable to test age as a predictor of total pmbsf area in our linear model. however, this should not affect the genetic analysis of total pmbsf area given that the age range in the dataset was fairly compact  and no significant relationship between age and total pmbsf/albsf area was previously detected  <cit> .

effects of brain and body weights
brain and body weight measurements correlated significantly. both also correlated significantly with total pmbsf area. however this correlation was modest at best. this suggests that total pmbsf area is not simply modulated by body and brain weights. in order to dissect these seemingly interrelated phenotypes, we used a linear model that essentially removed the effects of significant predictors of total pmbsf area. this led to the generation of adjusted total pmbsf area values that remove effects of brain weight, the most significant predictor. to gain a visual understanding and further confirm our total pmbsf area qtl, we mapped the raw data of both body and brain weights separately. as evident from body weight and brain weight qtl maps , there were no significant or suggestive qtls at any locus on the genome. the body weight and brain weight qtl signals that were found on chromosome  <dig> for both phenotypes do not overlap with the suggestive qtl we detected for total pmbsf area.

difference between parental strains
as previously reported  <cit> , the average brain weight of c57bl/6j is significantly larger than dba/2j. it was also previously observed that the dba/2j mice have a significantly larger albsf/pmbsf area than the c57bl/6j mice  <cit> . in our study, we did not detect an absolute difference between the pmbsf areas of c57bl/6j and dba/2j when using raw data. nonetheless, the trend is still present in our data; the dba/2j pmbsf area is larger than c57bl/6j pmbsf area by approximately 4%. however, after adjusting for brain weight, total pmbsf area of dba/2j is significantly larger than that of c57bl/6j by approximately  <dig> %.

total pmbsf area qtl
we report a genome-wide suggestive qtl on the proximal arm of chromosome  <dig> that is associated with total pmbsf area. mapping was conducted using total pmbsf area values adjusted for brain weight. as a comparison, raw value total pmbsf area was also mapped. there were no major differences between the two maps with regards to the signal on chromosome  <dig>  however the most notable differences are the reduction of two suggestive qtls on chromosomes  <dig> and x when adjusted total pmbsf area values are used. it is worth noting that following bootstrap analysis, we detected that one of our phenotyped strains  had a large effect on the significance of our suggestive qtl. when bxd <dig> was removed, the suggestive qtl on chromosome  <dig> exceeded the significance level. however, we included bxd <dig> for completion. furthermore, the shape of the qtl peak was nearly identical whether bxd <dig> was included or removed.

using the marker regression tool in webqtl, we observed four markers on chromosome  <dig> that were linked to adjusted total pmbsf area. interestingly, we previously reported two markers  that were associated with total pmbsf/albsf area  <cit> . however, only  <dig> bxd ri strains were utilized for mapping in that study. the much larger power of  <dig> bxd ri strains for the detection of significant qtls must be highlighted. in addition, different phenotypes were measured, where the previous study measured the entire representation of the whiskers of pmbsf and albsf area; here we focused exclusively on the total pmbsf area.

candidate genes
given the small number of genes within the suggestive qtl on chromosome  <dig>  we began exploring the genes that may be responsible for modulating total pmbsf area. in the absence of functional biological data, it is difficult to present a compelling case for any particular candidate gene present within a typically large qtl interval. in this study, we examined prospective genes within a fairly small interval spanning  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig>  two of these genes within this interval, , have a high number of snps, and particular biological relevance to total pmbsf area.

carbonic anhydrase-related protein viii  is a cis-acting gene that is located within our qtl interval starting at  <dig>  mb and contains  <dig> snps. cis-acting genes are known to regulate their own expression and are considered to be strong candidates for complex traits  <cit> . car <dig> is a member of the carbonic anhydrase gene family which contains  <dig> isoforms in humans  <cit> , three of which lack enzymatic activity due to missing one or more of the three zinc-binding histidines critical for catalysis  <cit> . those without catalytic activity are known as carbonic anhydrase-related proteins that include car <dig>  car <dig>  and car <dig>  <cit> . murine car <dig>  car <dig>  and car <dig> have high cdna and amino acid sequence similarity  with their human homologues, indicating a fundamental biological role for the carbonic anhydrase-related proteins  <cit> . car <dig> is expressed in the cell body of neurons in most parts of the cns  <cit> . early in human gestation, car <dig> is specifically expressed in neuroprogenitor cells in the subventricular zone and observed in neural cells migrating to the cortex  <cit> .

a more recent study has implicated a role for car <dig> in motor control in mice  <cit> . the car <dig> knockout, known as the waddles mutation, is characterized by wobbly side-to-side ataxic movement, typically seen  <dig> weeks after birth  <cit> . thus, car <dig> appears to be an important gene that is necessary for cns functioning.

rab <dig> is also a gene of interest that starts at  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig> under the total pmbsf area qtl. this gene harbors a total of  <dig> snps in the bxd cross and has a trans-acing qtl on distal chromosome  <dig> , in hippocampus, cerebellum, and whole brain transcriptomes. rab <dig> belongs to the rab subfamily of small gtp-binding proteins whose many members are thought to be involved in aiding in the targeting of cytosolic transport vesicles to their many destinations. perhaps one of the most studied members of this family is the ras gene. rabs work with an array of proteins including gtpase activating proteins  and guanine nucleotide exchange factors   <cit> . the rab <dig> protein is a resident of pre-golgi intermediates and is required for protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the golgi complex and is essential for the maturation of pre-golgi complexes  <cit> .

correlated gene expression profiles
whole-brain mrna expression profile correlation analysis revealed two genes that correlate significantly with total pmbsf area. the first, adenylate cyclase i , is a neurospecific membrane bound protein that catalyzes the formation of the crucial second-messenger camp  <cit> . expression of adcy <dig> is known to be linked with regions of the brain associated with plasticity, including the hippocampus and cerebral cortex  <cit> . mice with knockout adcy <dig> gene  do not develop the commonly observed barrel fields in the si cortex  <cit> . however, such mice are still known to have normal topological organization of the si cortex  <cit> . in addition to showing that disrupted adcy <dig> displays a barrelless phenotype, for the first time, a second messenger was directly linked to cortical development.

a second gene of interest, gap <dig>  negatively correlated with total pmbsf area . although not highly expressed, we report it for completion and more importantly, for its significant biological role. gap <dig> expression following stroke is strikingly similar to staining of gap <dig> in first and second postnatal weeks in the barrel cortex . gap <dig> is shown to be involved in post-stroke axonal sprouting  <cit>  and is important in critical stages of neurodevelopment of the barrel cortex  <cit> . erzurumlu and colleagues also showed that gap <dig> expression pattern was similar to the barrel field pattern, including the pmbsf region  <cit> . they reported the transient nature of gap <dig>  since almost no expression of gap <dig> was observed after post-natal day  <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
using  <dig> bxd ri strains, we identified a novel suggestive qtl on chromosome  <dig> that is associated with total pmbsf area. within this qtl, we propose that car <dig> is a likely candidate gene given that it has a strong cis-qtl with multiple independent probes and plays an essential role in cns functioning. taken together, our findings are a further step toward the identification of candidate genes that may be responsible for the modulation of total barrel subfield size in the si cortex.
