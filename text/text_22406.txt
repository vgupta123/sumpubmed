BACKGROUND
genetic markers are target sites in the genome that differ between individuals of a population. these differences can occur in dna that codes for specific genes, or usually in the vast areas of intergenic dna. these differences in the make-up of the genetic content at a specific site in the genome are often referred to as polymorphisms . these polymorphisms are detected with a range of different technologies of which simple sequence repeat markers   <cit>  and single nucleotide polymorphisms  are currently the most commonly used types. the markers used in this study are ssrs. the ssrs of interest for marker development include di-nucleotide and higher order repeats n, n, etc.). the number of repeats usually ranges between just a few units to several dozens of units. the polymorphism can exist at a locus containing a microsatellite between individuals of a population and is characterized as a different number of repeat units of the microsatellite, which is reported by several authors to result from an unbiased single-step random walk process  <cit> .

the detection of these differences occurs by site-specific amplification using polymerase chain reaction   <cit>  of the dna followed by electrophoresis in which the dna fragments are essentially separated by size. fragment sizes at a specific locus in the genome are also referred to as "alleles". depending on the ploidy level of the organism being studied , an individual can have one or more alleles at a specific locus. the set of alleles that has been collected for a given individual  is referred to as the "genotype" of that individual.

the polymorphism within a population can serve different purposes  <cit> : marker assisted selection in plant breeding  <cit> , genome selection during gene introgression in plant breeding  <cit> , genome mapping  <cit> , gene tagging  <cit> , population genetic structure  <cit> , and cultivar identification  <cit> .

our purpose is to propose an approach for using ssr marker genotypes to build predictive models to identify commercial tobacco varieties. predicting unknown samples requires genotyping. when large numbers of samples and ssr markers are involved, the genotyping process can be costly in terms of laboratory consumables, labor and time. as a consequence, it generally makes sense to select a minimal set of markers to build the prediction model.

as mentioned above, primers associated with an ssr marker that are amplified by pcr on a dna sample lead to several amplicon sizes,  defining the genotype of the sample. the results of such amplification on one sample are of the form g <dig> = a1/a2/.../am where ai is an integer depending on the number of microsatellite repeats between the two flanking primers and m depends on the ploidy type of the organism from which the dna is extracted . for ssr markers, the number ai is qualitative only and not quantitative as  is no more different than  from the point of view of the genetics. a snapshot of such a dataset is given in table  <dig> 

the challenge in building a supervised prediction model is therefore to handle these data, which are neither continuous, nor nominal, nor ordinal. a straightforward approach would be to code all the alleles and treat the  <dig> -  <dig> data in the feature space whose dimensions are defined by the distinct alleles in the training set. however, unless the initial feature space is enriched with extra dimensions and the prediction model is retrained, metrics on this binary data space will not take into account new alleles coming from new samples in order to use a prediction model built on this feature space of fixed dimension. defining the feature space as the infinite  direct sum of { <dig>  1} spaces and the usage of a kernel overcomes this limitation.

geneticists ususally compute the nei-li distance  <cit>  to estimate the evolutionary distance between the samples and unsupervised methods, like hierarchical clustering or principal coordinate analysis on the nei-li distance matrix, are commonly used to treat ssr data; but those are not suited to predict new dna samples. to our knowledge, only artificial neural networks have been used in a supervised manner in this context  <cit> , where the allele binary coding was used.

the purpose of this article is twofold:

1) show that encoding the ssr marker polymorphism into the nei-li similarities indeed defines a positive definite kernel that will allow the usage of supervised methods to address specific discrimination tasks;

2) describe a simple filter method  <cit>  for selecting identification kits, consisting of a small number of ssr markers that have acceptable discrimination ability for a specific task.

RESULTS
in this study, nicotiana tabacum, a functional diploid was used. the methods described above will be applied to four datasets, with distinct discrimination purposes. the material and method description for the primers development and genotyping of the samples can be found in  <cit> . four datasets were developed:

a) tobtype: a set of  <dig> varieties were genotyped on  <dig> ssr markers without replicates; that lead to  <dig> observations . the objective is to discriminate the following tobacco types: burley, flue cured and oriental.

b) landrace: a set of  <dig> different landraces of a given variety  were genotyped on  <dig> ssr markers for a total of  <dig> observations . the groups to discriminate are the  <dig> landraces of this variety.

c) geovar: a set of  <dig> different varieties from the same geographic region were genotyped on  <dig> ssr markers for a total of  <dig> observations . the objective is to discriminate the  <dig> known subtypes.

d) orvar: a set of  <dig> different varieties from the same tobacco type  were genotyped on  <dig> ssr markers for a total of  <dig> observations . the objective is to discriminate  <dig> pre-defined families.

mutual information based feature selection   <cit>  and maximum relevance - minimum redundancy   <cit>  and our method  are compared on those four datasets, generated internally. the comparison is done on a range from n =  <dig> to  <dig> markers. for mifs, the additional parameter β <cit>   is chosen by cross-validation over the set of values  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>  and for our method α is chosen over the same set. the cross-validation loop includes the feature selection to avoid a possible selection bias. the results shown in the tables are the best 10-fold cross-validated results over the parameters of each method and the classification error rates for the different kit sizes, when combined with kernel linear discriminant analysis  or kernel principal component analysis followed by linear discriminant analysis  are shown in table  <dig> and table  <dig>  the number of markers in the kit, n, is kept as a separate parameter as a consensus between performance and kit size has to be reached.

overall, the proposed method leads to satisfying results, comparable or better than the other ones. only in four cases , improved performance by at least 3% lower error rate were found by the other selection methods. out of  <dig> cases, the proposed method obtained the best results  in  <dig> cases. though generally the improvements are slight, for a few cases the relative difference in error rates is substantial.

it is interesting to consider the case α =  <dig> separately as it forbids skipping features and allows an evaluation of the benefit of skipping markers. in the vast majority of comparisons, skipping markers is beneficial and the differences in error rate range from 1% to 15% .

comparing the obtained results on all three methods to the classification error rates using all the markers , one can observe that better error rates can be obtained by the selected kits for all the datasets except the geovar dataset, where only kpclda with  <dig> markers can almost reach the error rate of the full set of ssr.

in order to evaluate how the selected set of markers performs versus the other subsets of cardinality  <dig>  an exhaustive search  was performed. the 10-fold cross-validation results from this simulations are summarized in table  <dig>  among all the subsets of size  <dig>  the one chosen by the algorithm belongs to the best  <dig> % sets of size  <dig> for kpclda  - 8% , best subset = 4%) and the best  <dig> % for klda , best subset = 1%), which show the abiltiy of the feature selection algorithm to capture the few most important markers.

summary of the cross-validation results for all possible combinations of  <dig> markers among  <dig> markers 

the final kit sizes retained for the datasets under consideration are  <dig> for tobtype,  <dig> for landrace,  <dig> for geovar,  <dig> for orvar. for the  <dig> first datasets no marker is skipped, for the third dataset the fifth most powerful marker is skipped and finally for the fourth dataset the third and fourth most powerful markers are skipped by the algorithm.

CONCLUSIONS
the nei-li similarity was shown to define a positive definite kernel on the set of marker genotypes and therefore is a very convenient way to encode the polymorphisms contained in ssr marker data. it has shown its ability to be used further for ssr fingerprint based predictions. to our knowledge, the usage of kernel methods in this context is new.

on the four case studies presented, the proposed algorithm for selecting ssr marker kits can definitely lead to economical and efficient prediction models for discrimination. the algorithm is independent of the supervised method chosen in the modelling process .

the results also show that as a general rule, the full set of markers is not necessarily the most predictive kit, and for all case studies presented, similar classification performance can be achieved with less than  <dig> markers.

simulation studies show that the kit selection algorithm performs well as compared to the best subset selection when combined with klda or kp-clda; both methods leading to low classification error rate. feature selection strategies that can deal with categorical data in classification are not so common and the proposed filter approach might be useful in other contexts as well.

the main advantage of the approach is to benefit from a fast algorithm that results in a few specific markers for a given task. an exhaustive search is generally infeasible or is very time consuming. the choice of the constant can be done by cross-validation. however, from our experience α =  <dig>  is consensually a good default choice and performs well.

the choice α =  <dig>  leading to a very straightforward approach, is usually less performant; even though it leads to the best results in  <dig> cases. hence, this possibility should not be disregarded when performing a cross-validation experiment on α.

when the number of markers becomes smaller, the missgenotyping effect becomes more pronounced and new genotypes on new measured samples affect the genetic dissimilarities more . therefore, it should be stressed that choosing the minimum number of markers for a given problem can lead to weaker generalization properties of the classifier due to the fact that the new samples whose type or landraces are unknown are perhaps not in the original dataset and may have new genotypes. it is therefore recommended, in practice, to use at least  <dig> markers in a selection kit, if the number of classes to discriminate is greater than  <dig>  moreover, the pre-processing and identification of the electrophoresis amplicons as well as the marker usage have to be well established in order to test new samples. the quality of the laboratory work and of the ssr markers development used here also contributed to the efficiency of the models.
