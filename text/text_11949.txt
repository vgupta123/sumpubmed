BACKGROUND
the complete genome sequencing of plasmodium  <cit>  allowed the prediction of around  <dig>  open reading frames . regulation of gene expression of this unicellular eukaryote is probably governed, as for all eukaryotes, by common mechanisms including epigenetic, transcriptional as well as post-transcriptional regulation. during the pathogenic intra-erythrocytic development, the parasite undergoes a highly complex life cycle characterized by a succession of very different developmental stages. however, the molecular events controlling stage development are not known. during the last decade, investigations of several plasmodium transcripts  <cit>  were followed by comprehensive analyses of transcript levels via pan-genomic micro-array approaches  <cit> . all these data revealed that the plasmodium genome is transcriptionally active, since at least 60% of the plasmodium transcripts were differentially and tightly regulated throughout the developmental transition. indeed, the morphological changes observed throughout the erythrocytic cycle  are probably governed by the fine tuning of coordinate expression of genes. one can reasonably assume that gene expression is under the control of various transcriptional mechanisms: structuring and remodelling of chromatin, combinatorial interactions between trans and cis regulatory elements  even though post-transcriptional regulation probably participates significantly to gene regulation as well .

despite a growing number of computational and molecular experimental approaches developed to understand gene regulation in plasmodium, knowledge of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation is clearly quite limited and the annotation of the cis and trans elements implicated in gene transcription is poor. in addition, the relative contributions of the mechanisms governing gene regulation  are still a subject of debate, awaiting a number of additional functional experiments. indeed, only a small number of putative specific transcription factors  could be identified when compared to other unicellular eukaryotic organisms  <cit> . if a small number of specific transcription factors is a real characteristic of plasmodium, this might in turn account for the unusual mechanisms of gene regulation involving a major contribution of epigenetic and post-transcriptional machineries  <cit> . conversely, around 60% of orphan genes among the  <dig>  predicted orfs might lead to the apparent dearth of potential transcription-associated proteins  in plasmodium. the high a/t rich genome probably contributes to this poor annotation due to a weak similarity of plasmodium factors with the amino acid sequences of eukaryotic proteins listed in databanks including transfacÂ® the transcription factor database  <cit> .

nevertheless, plasmodium shares with other eukaryotes common mechanisms involved in gene transcriptional regulation. this assumption is supported by the nucleosome organization, structure of promoters and monocistronic mrna transcription as well as by the rna messenger organization: occurrence of introns, even if short and scarce, standard splice and acceptor sites, and conventional 5' and 3' untranslated regions that are capped and polyadenylated, respectively. indeed, several genes of plasmodium have been investigated and appeared to share the overall features of eukaryotic genes indicating that plasmodium gene regulation might resemble that of eukaryotes, even though the transcriptional regulatory elements might be more divergent  <cit> . since the parasite's development is characterized by coordinate expression of genes, it is realistic to consider that, as for all eukaryotes, the modulation of transcription efficiency in addition to epigenetic regulation should be under the control of combinatorial interactions between specific transcription factors with their cognate cis re present within the promoters. in addition, the level of transcription might be modulated by the diversity and the hierarchy of affinity of different members of a family of transcription factors towards a variety of dna motifs present in the promoters. the transcriptional control would also depend on the availability of the factors throughout the parasite cycle. very few interactions between such factors and dna motifs have been investigated in plasmodium either with factor identification  <cit>  or without  <cit>  and the best studied interactions concern var gene regulation .

despite the enormous effort of the wellcome trust sanger institute genedb and the plasmodb teams to improve the genome annotation of p. falciparum, tap prediction still remains elusive. genome mining and proteome analysis highlighted the apparent small number of recognizable specific tfs  <cit> . this led the plasmodium community to favour a paucity of specific tfs conferring a higher control of gene regulation at epigenetic and post-transcriptional levels when compared to other eukaryotes. however, it cannot be ruled out that this apparent lack of specific tfs resides in the complexity of annotation and much work remains to be done before reaching any clear-cut conclusion. indeed, in silico prediction using successively two computational procedures  <cit>  led to the annotation of most of the general tfs implicated in the basal transcriptional machinery. furthermore, in addition to the four histone proteins  <cit>  composing nucleosomes and the modifying enzymes implicated in the histone code, a rather high number of chromatin-structuring and remodelling factors, was predicted in plasmodium. as regards the transfac classification  <cit>  a number of factors belonging to two super-classes: zinc-coordinating dna-binding domains  <cit>  and apiap <dig> proteins  <cit>  have been in silico annotated in the parasite. conversely, a lack of hits for conserved dna binding domains including homeodomains, mads, bzip, bhlh and gata fingers, and fkh domains was observed in the genome  <cit> . only a few factors have been analysed for their interaction with their cognate re. despite the observation that some transcription factors can bind to specific dna domains present within a number of promoters  <cit> , some remained uncharacterized  <cit> . however, some specific taps were analysed at the molecular level. several years ago, after annotation by sequence homology of different sets of potential taps, our functional studies undertaken with pfmyb <dig>  a member of the hth sub-family with tryptophan domains demonstrated for the first time that this factor was capable to interact specifically with dna motifs present in plasmodium promoters as also observed for pfmyb <dig>  . in addition, pfmyb <dig> was capable to modulate expression of several targeted genes  <cit> . recently, a functional study of three members of the apiap <dig> family was reported  <cit> . the next challenge will be to determine novel plasmodium specific taps that have never been found in other eukaryotes.

herein, we have used in silico predictions  <cit>  and our contribution focused on the factors involved in global transcriptional regulation of messenger rna in order to propose a comprehensive directory of taps grouped in four classes and sub-classes. the specific transcription factors were clustered according to transfac nomenclature. also, we modelled their transcriptome and proteome expression profiles throughout erythrocytic development and protein-protein interaction network from reports described in the literature  <cit> . the results obtained on a small number of previously annotated specific factors were also taken into account. this study was carried out to unravel, at least to some extent, the nuclear transcription network occurring during the life-cycle transitions of the erythrocytic plasmodium cycle.

RESULTS
since a number of reports showed that the transcriptome profiles change  <cit>  during the parasite erythrocytic development, it was reasonable to assume that different sets of taps were essential to govern the fine tuning of transcriptional regulation during the erythrocytic cycle. however, only a few in silico studies concerning p. falciparum taps have been published. coulson and collaborators  <cit>  used two strategies to identify the tfs of p. falciparum:  <dig> hmm profiles from transfac and a sequence similarity clustering method were used to identify  <dig> tap including specific transcription factors in the p. falciparum genome. however, among these  <dig> taps only  <dig> were implicated in transcription of messenger rna encoded by the nuclear genome. callebaut and colleagues  <cit>  used a two dimensional hydrophobic cluster analysis  to identify  <dig> additional general tfs. finally, balaji et al.  <cit>  reported numerous members of the apiap <dig> family of specific transcription factors.

it is important to define what we have considered as taps listed in the directory . it comprises a global classification of all annotated taps appearing in the literature relative to messenger rna transcription. all factors associated with transcription of ribosomal and transfer rnas and those associated with apicoplast, mitochondria and mini-chromosome maintenance were excluded from the list.

the number of all sets of transcription-associated proteins are listed according to their classes and sub-classes named with respect to their potential functional implication in transcription of the messenger rna.

i. comprehensive directory of factors associated with plasmodium transcription
combining the aforementioned data and the pfam database annotations, we selected  <dig> hmm profiles to scan the whole plasmodium genome in order to identify the general transcription factors: the rna polymerases and factors composing the pre-initiation complex , all factors implicated in chromatin remodelling and enzymatic modifications as well as the specific transcription factors. it is of note that coulson and colleagues used only  <dig> hmm followed by a sequence similarity clustering method . our functional annotation was assessed by two strategies: 1) by comparing the domain organization of each protein to annotated proteins sharing the same domain organization in the pfam database and 2) by searching orthologs in model organisms. this double check procedure minimized false positive taps . when the tap candidates were annotated as belonging to a protein complex in model organisms, all p. falciparum orthologs of the complex were searched and subunits that were missed using the hmm strategy were added to the final list of taps. in addition, it was possible to identify, based mainly on chromatin binding domains and protein-protein interactions, in the plasmodium 3d <dig> genomic sequence completed in  <dig>  <cit> , diverse protein domains associated with functional features of eukaryotic taps in charge of transcription regulation and in turn involved in a variety of cellular processes. this directory was used to link each putative factor with its expected function in order to increase the knowledge of plasmodium transcriptional machinery. our in silico procedure increased the number of hmm and thus the quality of functional annotation and we identified  <dig> taps. among these factors are the previously annotated factors:  <dig> by coulson et al.,  <dig> by callebaut et al.,  <dig> apiap <dig> by balaji et al.,  <dig> recovered from plasmodb and  <dig> novel annotations including several previously identified by vaquero's team. they were classified into four functional classes and sub-classes. for specific tfs, we used the transfac database classification.

the four classes are: i) the general transcription factors  with all polymerase subunits and general co-activators involved in initiation and elongation of mrna transcripts; ii) the factors involved in chromatin-structuring and remodelling of the nucleosomes as well as the histones implicated in the nucleosome structure. in this section all modifying enzymes associated with the epigenetic code governing histone modifications and therefore accountable for the modulation of transcription level were added. for simplification, all these factors were included in chromatin-related transcription factors ; iii) all specific transcription factors  annotated so far, including the recent group of apiap <dig>  whose interactions with specific dna sequences  participate in transcription efficiency. the stfs have been clustered according to transfac classification. finally, we listed a few members of tap partners in class iv. a brief description of all tap is summarized in table  <dig>  listed in tables  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and detailed in additional file  <dig> 

i. general transcription factors
the  <dig> general tfs  presented in class i  came from two in silico studies performed by coulson  <cit>  and callebaut  <cit> . the first study, based on  <dig> hmm profiles and a sequence similarity clustering method allowed the annotation of  <dig> rna polymerase subunits, two accessory proteins ,  <dig> general co-activators and  <dig> tfii subunits all potentially involved in the initiation of messenger rna transcription composing the pre-initiation complex . as previously mentioned, only  <dig> of the tfii core complex members were identified in the genome, leading to the hypothesis that there are major differences in the transcriptional machinery of plasmodium when compared to other eukaryotes. nevertheless, nine additional subunits involved in transcription initiation and one tfiif involved in initiation and elongation were annotated by the second study using a program based on hca and secondary protein structure, and profile-based search methods   <cit> . therefore, the subunit number of the pic rose to  <dig> putative proteins. in addition, we also integrated in this general transcription factor set,  <dig> ccr4-not  additional factors involved in initiation and elongation of transcription as well as four co-activators involved in elongation.

ii. chromatin-related transcription factors
we included in class ii all putative taps with domain features that make them good candidates for participating in nucleosomal organization, chromatin remodelling and epigenetic modification. all these  <dig> proteins, that play a role in epigenetic regulation of transcription to different degrees, were clustered in four different sub-classes .

in sub-class  <dig>  eight histone genes identified in the parasite were listed in plasmodb: two h2a, two h2b, three h <dig> and one h <dig>  <cit> . two sets of these genes were bi-directionally localized in the genome with respect to their common putative promoters . these proteins might be involved in nucleosome architecture at a given time of erythrocytic development. note that histone h <dig>  interacting with the dna linker between two nucleosomes, has not yet been found in the p. falciparum genome, despite searches with a variety of different computational approaches.

in sub-class  <dig> were also listed  <dig> chromatin structuring proteins comprising factors with a) a bromo domain  that may play a role in assembly or activity of multi-component complexes involved in transcriptional activation; b) a chromo domain for chrromatin organisation modifier  and c) a snf <dig> domain  found in proteins involved in a variety of processes including transcription regulation . in this sub-class, a factor pfhp <dig>  with a chromo domain was very recently reported to be implicated in heterochromatin formation and antigenic variation  <cit> .

sub-class  <dig> comprises  <dig> factors implicated in chromatin remodelling including nucleosome assembly proteins   <cit>  and four high mobility group box b  proteins including pfhmgb <dig>  and pfhmgb <dig>  that were studied molecularly  <cit> . these architectural functions participate in chromatin remodelling and in turn contribute to regulation of gene transcription.

finally, sub-class  <dig> contains a large set of  <dig> factors that take into account all putative enzymes linked to the epigenetic histone code and predicted to modify the efficiency of transcription, mostly histone acetyl transferases  and histone deacetyl transferases  including sir <dig> proteins. in addition, some methyl transferases  were also listed as well as one demethylase . indeed, all these factors govern the transcriptional efficacy either positively or negatively  <cit> .

iii. specific transcription factors, 
the specific transcription factors  were clustered in four sub-classes corresponding to transfac classification  with a large variation in the number of putative factors from one in super-class  <dig> to  <dig> in super-class  <dig> of transfac. actually, most of the specific factors found in plasmodium belong to three transfac super-classes:

0sc: a group of  <dig> tap of the ap <dig> family proteins preferentially encountered in plants was recently annotated by balaji and co-workers  <cit>  and listed in the directory. very recently, three factors of this family have been analysed at the molecular level  <cit> .

2sc: zinc-coordinating dna-binding domains with  <dig> putative factors including diverse sets of zinc finger proteins all implicated in interaction with nucleic acids.

3sc: helix-turn-helix with seven members of the myb family sub-class encompassing one to three tryptophan domains. the functional activity of two members has been studied: pfmyb <dig>   <cit>  and pfmyb <dig>  .

one annotation within the 4sc beta scaffold factors and no annotation could be made for proteins of the 1sc leucine zipper family. hence, not all families of factors annotated so far in eukaryotes were found in the parasite.

in summary, the different members of taps in p. falciparum gave a total of  <dig> proteins. our selection included the  <dig> taps from coulson,  <dig> from callebaut,  <dig> apiap <dig> from balaji,  <dig> from plasmodb and our  <dig> new annotations. the relationship between our predictions and the three previous reports is summarized in the venn diagram presented in additional file  <dig> 

the genome of plasmodium comprises  <dig> gtfs . hence, the number of the putative general transcription factors, composing the enormous protein complex governing transcription initiation and interacting with the basal promoter region, appeared quite similar to that observed in other eukaryotes  <cit> . since the gtfs are reasonably well conserved, it might be assumed, even though molecular functional analyses are still lacking, that they govern transcription initiation and elongation as in other eukaryotes  <cit> .

as for the proteins involved in the structure of nucleosomes , in the modulation of nucleosome compactness and last but not least the modifying enzymes in charge of the epigenetic alteration of taps,  <dig> ctfs proteins were identified . all sets of modifying enzymes are present in plasmodium. the number of the putative ctfs resembles, as observed with gtfs, that of other unicellular eukaryotes and principally at the level of histone proteins and proteins involved in the histone code. again, plasmodium epigenetic regulation might be like that of other eukaryotes. finally, our selection globally looks like that of horrocks et al.  <cit> , even though we excluded a few proteins and included several additional ones.

only  <dig> stfs , known in eukaryotes to interact specifically with dna motifs within the gene promoters and therefore contributing to the fine tuning of transcription level, were observed in plasmodium. this number was quite similar to that of epigenetic taps  however, far less than the number encountered in other unicellular eukaryotes with a similar number of orfs such as s. cerevisiae and s. pombe. in addition, the diversity of classes and sub-classes of the stf when compared to the transfac list is lower in plasmodium with essentially two families of factors -  <dig> apiap <dig> first reported in plants  <cit>  and a large variety of zinc finger proteins . this paucity of stfs, which has led members of the community to predict that gene regulation might be accomplished through a major contribution of epigenetic dna or post transcriptional mechanisms, may be a consequence of not having looked hard enough or having an incomplete knowledge of novel original classes of proteins that might regulate transcription in plasmodium. it might also result from poor annotation of proteins, when computational approaches are based on homology of amino acid sequences probably too far from those of other eukaryotes. it is noteworthy that in the case of gtfs their number increased when annotation was based on hca program and the structure of functional domains that have been known for decades to be more conserved than amino acid sequences.

finally, the annotation of regulatory elements in plasmodium falciparum is probably very poor due to the highly a-t rich genome. however, the search for binding domains  <cit>  within the promoters interacting with specific transcriptional factors is becoming a fashionable query. therefore, we think that plasmodium shares more components involved in mrna synthesis machinery than previously envisaged. nevertheless, plasmodium might keep some originality, for example specific dna-protein interactions yet to be predicted and different from those listed in transfac database since the a/t composition within the gene promoters might reach up to 90%.

ii. molecular characterization of several annotated tap
in contrast to the number of in silico annotated putative tap very few of them have been analysed at the molecular level, essentially histones and proteins involved in epigenetic regulation, highlighting that molecular validation of the factors has to be expanded. some representative reports dealing with molecular and functional studies of several sets of taps are indicated in the right column of additional file  <dig> and will be briefly reviewed. the function of very few gtf has been studied and most of the articles reporting such functions were published many years ago. most publications concern the tbp  <cit>  and the pic  <cit> .

within the ctfs, some of the histones composing the nucleosomes have been investigated since  <dig>  <cit> . two of the hmgb factors, among the four annotated, were investigated as to their function and interaction with dna structures  <cit> . finally, a number of reports were published on various modifying enzymes implicated in the modification of the proteins involved in the overall histone code. these post-translational modifications  play a role in gene regulation. recently, the pfhp <dig>   <cit>  was described as playing an important role in chromatin dynamics during antigenic variation and silencing of the var genes  <cit> .

in contrast to the number of reports dealing with proteins involved in epigenetic regulation, there are only a few descriptions of stfs. several unidentified proteins have been reported to bind dna sequences  <cit>  or dna motifs  <cit>  present in some plasmodium promoters. in addition, very few stfs believed to interact with cognate dna binding motifs were studied per se and validated molecularly: pfmyb <dig>   <cit>  and recently, three members of the apiap <dig> family   <cit> .

iii. transcriptome profiles of the putative tap during the erythrocytic development of p. falciparum
we analysed the transcriptome profiles of the  <dig> tap retained in this study, throughout the erythrocytic development of p. falciparum. to this end, we used data generated in two independent high-throughput transcriptome analyses from the de risi's and winzeler's groups  <cit> . it is important to emphasize that there are substantial differences between the microarray designs of the two groups. in de risi's study,  <dig> mer long oligonucleotides were immobilized and the transcript levels were monitored every hour during the ~ <dig> hr of the erythrocytic cycle as a ratio of a mixed population of transcripts. the data represent the transcript expression profile underlining the relative maximal and minimal levels of expression. in winzeler's study  <dig> mer oligonucleotides covering the entire plasmodium genome were used. their analysis was restricted to different stages representative of the intra-erythrocytic cycle  as well as sporozoite and gametocyte stages. some genes were absent from de risi's data while present in winzeler's data due to incompleteness of annotations at the time of array design. the latter data were proposed by the group to be more accountable for the relative expression level of every transcript and therefore complementary to the figures given by de risi's analyses.

i. a phaseogram of the idc transcriptome was created as indicated in  <cit>  ordering the transcriptional profiles of all taps presented in de risi's data sets. examination of the time course of all transcripts of the four classes of taps showed a cascade distribution moving from maximal expression early in erythrocytic cycle to maximal expression thereafter . the transcripts were subdivided in seven different groups according to their temporal expression: from maximal expression during the early stages of development  to maximal expression later in the erythrocytic cycle . the temporal modulation of transcripts as regards to their putative functions emphasized a wide distribution within the seven sets of transcripts even though enrichment of some sub-classes was observed in particular sets. class i transcripts and sub-classes corresponding mainly to rna polymerase ii and general cofactor subunits implicated in transcription initiation and elongation appeared more in group  <dig> and  <dig> at the onset of parasite cycle than in the subsequent groups followed by the ccr4-not transcripts later in the cycle. this was expected since these factors contribute to the basal transcriptional machinery. in contrast, all members of classes ii and iii including all sub-classes were extensively distributed throughout the erythrocytic cycle. moreover, winzeler's data, concerning six erythrocytic stages , were compared to the  <dig> hr-de risi's phaseogram. even though it is not easy to compare such diverse time course experiments, after normalization of the data by the mean of the intensities of each rbc cycle, a good correlation between the two sets of data was observed strengthening the quality of the analyses.

ii the phaseogram issued from de risi's group was ordered according to every class of taps from i to iv and then compared to winzeler's data that evaluate better the transcript levels, therefore leading to complementary information . in figure 1i, where only the gtfs  were examined, maximal expression of transcripts encoding different rna polymerase subunits implicated in transcription of the three classes of rna  and one transcript encoding the tbp  appeared somewhat earlier in the cycle than those of rna polymerases ii subunits only contributing to messenger transcription . this was followed by maximal expression of transcripts encoding diverse members of the tfii subunits and ccr4-not along with the caat and tbp-like proteins. in addition, it can be seen in winzeler's data that several rna pol ii subunits  were highly expressed as well as some of the tfii subunits in contrast to others. finally, some of these transcripts were found preferentially either in gametocytes  or in sporozoites  when compared to the erythrocytic cycle, indicating some specificity of expression within diverse stages of parasite development.

in figure  <dig> ii, maximal and minimal expression of transcripts encoding different ctfs and in particular several members of the different sub-classes of modifying enzymes such as hdacs, hats and sets proteins were distributed over the cycle, as observed for diverse members of the general factors. moreover, some members of the modifying enzyme sub-class  appeared to be highly expressed whereas others showed a low level of expression. as expected, high expression of every histone transcript, corresponding to the most abundant proteins encountered in eukaryote nuclei,  was also observed and maximal expression was evidenced in the last part of the cycle . it is noteworthy that two pairs of histone genes  shared one bidirectional promoter. the time course analysis of transcript expression of the h4-h2b genes revealed that they were probably co-regulated compared to the h3-h2a transcripts. in addition, in winzeler's data, h4-h2b were highly expressed, as expected for histone genes throughout erythrocytic development and in gametocytes whereas h <dig> was less expressed in sporozoites than h2b. information on the level of expression of h3-h2a transcripts is lacking in winzeler's data. particular attention was paid to the temporal expression of three pfhmgb transcripts: only pfhmgb <dig> was present on de risi's microarray with a transcriptome profile resembling those of histone transcripts. in contrast, in winzeler's microarrays the three pfhmgb <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> transcripts were present. as expected, the transcripts of both pfhmgb <dig> and  <dig> were markedly expressed throughout the erythrocytic cycle with higher expression of pfhmgb <dig> in gametocytes than pfhmgb <dig> in good agreement with our previous results  <cit> .

in figure  <dig> iii, as expected from the previous observations, the transcripts of different members of a given sub-class of stf and in particular the  <dig> zinc finger,  <dig> apiap <dig> and eight hth factors were distributed all over the phaseogram. in addition, as aforementioned, some of these factors are diversely expressed. concerning the three apiap <dig> factors  <cit>  that have been molecularly analysed, the transcript of apiap <dig> ring  elicited maximal expression earlier in the erythrocytic cycle than apiap <dig> schizont  and . maximal expression of the others was distributed throughout the phaseogram. in addition, some apiap <dig> were preferentially expressed either in sporozoÃ¯tes or gametocytes. for the hth factors pfmyb <dig> and pfmyb <dig>  the maximum of expression of pfmyb <dig>  occurred earlier in the cycle than that of pfmyb <dig> . the level of pfmyb <dig> expression is in good agreement with our previous report where we showed that pfmyb <dig> was poorly expressed and pfmyb <dig> protein was present more in the ring nuclear extracts than later in the cycle when analysed by emsa approach  <cit> . the finding that various members of a family of specific transcription factors are spread over the cycle or sometimes expressed in specific stages of the erythrocytic cycle was expected. this observation underlines their functional diversity in transcriptional regulation of different sets of transcripts according to the interacting domains and their presence on the promoters of different sets of genes. in addition, it is important to determine the differential expression of some transcripts in all stages of parasite development including gametocytes and sporozoites. it is obvious that several tap transcripts are preferentially expressed in gametocytes and others in sporozoites corresponding to differentiated and arrested stages, in contrast to proliferating stages from rings to schizonts. finally, it is interesting to associate mrna and protein expression. this will be discussed further when expression of the cognate proteins will be analysed and compared to transcript expression.

iii. all transcripts issued from winzeler's data were clustered by k-means method within five different clusters ranging from low  to high  expression of transcripts . this data presentation was used to highlight the highly expressed transcripts within the parasite. it appears that diverse members of several classes and sub-classes of tap were expressed differentially throughout erythrocytic development as well as in gametocyte and sporozoite stages. in clusters  <dig> to  <dig>  the level of expression was low and often a lack of data  was observed due to undetectable expression of transcripts among which members of all sub-classes of the four classes of taps. additionally, some transcripts were preferentially expressed in gametocytes: two zn-ccch , snf <dig> , tbp-like  and histone h <dig> . several others, including apiap <dig>  and zf-c <dig> h <dig> , were more expressed in sporozoites than during the erythrocytic stages. a wide distribution of different transcript members was observed also for clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  where transcript expression clearly reached a high level. transcripts encoding histones and naps involved in nucleosomal and epigenetic transcriptional regulation are highly expressed as observed in all eukaryotes. actually, winzeler's data monitored five histone transcripts present in cluster  <dig> , one h <dig> , one h2a  and one h2b . the h <dig>  transcript appeared poorly expressed  in contrast to the others, but was highly expressed in gametocytes. in contrast to pfmyb <dig> , the low expression of pfmyb <dig>  is in good agreement with our previous report  <cit> . finally, the apiap <dig> transcripts were also found in all clusters therefore indicating a wide variation of their expression levels. as for the two reported apiap <dig>  <cit> , one does not even appear in cluster  <dig> , in contrast to the other  which in addition was not expressed in gametocytes but in sporozoites. finally, some of the transcripts were more highly expressed throughout the erythrocytic cycle in contrast to others preferentially expressed either in sporozoites or in gametocytes such as several members of transcripts encoding apia <dig> and zinc finger proteins.

in summary, the large diversity in the levels of tap transcripts observed during the plasmodium erythrocytic cycle is essential to understand the functional differentiation observed during the complex development of the parasite within the human and mosquito hosts. in the case of stfs such as the apiap <dig> family, the availability of the encoded proteins and the hierarchy of interactions between the different members  with a variety of cognate dna regulatory elements displayed in the gene promoters would affect the efficiency of gene expression governing the fine tuning of transcript expression throughout the development of the parasite. in addition, some transcripts are highly expressed in plasmodium such as histone and hmgb transcripts. in this respect, again, plasmodium resembles the other eukaryotes since these proteins are known to be the most highly expressed in eukaryote nuclei.

iv. genomic localization of tap
to determine whether genomic organization of tap genes might govern coordinated expression of genes, the localization of transcript clusters was analysed. all  <dig> tap open reading frames were mapped along the genomic sequences of the  <dig> chromosomes. a wide distribution of the tap orfs and in particular all members of the diverse tap families was observed over the  <dig> chromosomes with the exception of the telomeric regions where no tap genes were found; as expected . in addition, there are very few bona fide clusters of taps, only six with a low number of genes and located in different chromosomes . in chromosome  <dig>  a cluster of five genes composed of several gtf sub-units , a ctf  and a stf with bromo domains  was found close to the centromere. their maximal expression occurs rather early in the plasmodium cycle . as for the eight histone genes  they are present in chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  two tandems of bidirectional genes h3-h2a and h4-h2b are observed in chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. chromosome  <dig> also contains an additional histone h <dig> gene close to the centromere. a third putative histone h <dig> is present in chromosome  <dig>  therefore, the presence of three different histone h <dig> genes might be important since expression of specific members might occur at different stages of parasite development. the maximal expression of histone genes occurred fairly late in the cycle, along with parasite proliferation, with a close coordinated expression, especially for h4-h2b. in chromosome  <dig>  a two gene cluster was observed encoding an hdac and a yippee like protein, a putative zinc binding protein listed in class iv partners . however, they are not co-regulated. finally, there are two additional two gene clusters in chromosome  <dig>  fairly well co-regulated comprising the transcripts for pfmyb <dig>  and for a bromo domain putative protein  , the second one also comprising an hdac pf10_ <dig> and pf10_ <dig> encompassing several phd and at hook domains .

in summary, there are only a few tap genes organized in small genomic clusters in plasmodium and only a loose co-regulation of expression was observed for these clusters as repeatedly encountered in eukaryotes. there again, plasmodium behaves like other eukaryotes.

v. analysis of the proteome profiles and comparison with the transcriptome data
the proteome data are based on four different reports  <cit>  that, for simplification, we will refer to in the following paragraph as a, b, c and d for le roch, florens and the two lasonder's reports. figure  <dig> shows on the left, the a transcriptome data with respect to every class of tap from i to iv and seven different parasite stages of erythrocytic development as well as gametocytes and sporozoites  for comparison with their cognate proteins. for a and b proteome reports, the same methodology was used based on mudpit followed by mass spectrometry. the a data reported the identification of  <dig> tap of the  <dig> listed in the directory  and b data  <dig>  most of the factors were identified by both groups, while a few of them were identified only by c. the methodology used by c and d was based on 1d gel protein fractionation of mainly the gametocyte stages and parasite stages from the mosquito followed by ms. they reported only  <dig> tap including several additional proteins not detected by either group a or b. it is noteworthy that the total number of proteins determined by the a, b and c groups  throughout erythrocytic development represents around half the number of transcripts. it has been already stated that the number of identified proteins is markedly lower than that of transcripts most probably due to the different sensitivity of the experimental approaches. indeed, the global analysis in plasmodium described  <dig> transcripts with only  <dig> cognate proteins detected in the investigated erythrocytic stages  <cit> .

in figure  <dig> we compared the a transcriptome profiles to the semi-quantitative evaluation of cognate proteins with a colour code from black-blue  to orange-red  and some representative examples are presented. the comparison of the a transcriptome with b and c proteome data appeared difficult to establish because only trophozoite or trophozoite/schizont stages were investigated for protein expression. only the comparison between a transcriptome  and proteome data can be correctly considered. however, we extended our examination to the merozoite, gametocyte and sporozoite data.

first, some highly expressed transcripts showed high expression of their cognate proteins indicating a correlation between their levels of expression. considering the three proteomics data, most of the histone proteins were highly expressed during the erythrocytic cycle, either as transcripts or as proteins, albeit histone h <dig> and h2a were not seen in the a transcriptome and proteome experiments. tandem proteins  were highly expressed at each stage and to a lesser extent tandem . conversely, some discrepancy was observed between expression of transcripts and proteins in gametocytes and sporozoites, especially in the case of one h2a protein . the two pfhmgb proteins are highly expressed throughout the cycle, as their cognate transcripts, with a substantial correlation observed during the erythrocytic cycle. however, in gametocytes expression of pfhmgb <dig>  is high in contrast to that of pfhmgb <dig>  in good agreement with our previous results showing a preferential expression of pfhmgb <dig> in gametocytes  <cit> . pfhmgb <dig> is also highly expressed in sporozoites in contrast to the pfhmgb <dig> counterpart. another set of highly expressed proteins, the two nap  are highly expressed in gametocytes  <cit>  but not in sporozoites.

second, discrepancy between levels of transcript and protein expression was observed, either high transcript levels associated to low protein levels or vice versa. there are several cases of tap proteins highly expressed with low expression, if any, of their cognate transcripts nap pfb <dig>  or specifically detected in some particular stages of plasmodium cycle. for example, rpb <dig>  is expressed essentially in gametes  and h2a  in gametocytes and sporozoites in both a and b proteome data with almost no detection of the corresponding transcripts. this suggests a specific expression and therefore a key role of this factor in these plasmodium stages. this is also true for a spt <dig>  and bbox  proteins highly expressed in merozoites with nearly no cognate transcript. in contrast, some mrna, found in either class of tap, were highly expressed with low amounts of cognate proteins. two hdac , various set proteins including set , one zf-ccch protein , one pfmyb-related factor  were poorly expressed, even undetectable either in the b and/or c experiments. several apiap <dig> transcripts were also highly expressed  with conversely weak expression if any of the corresponding proteins. both transcriptional and proteomic methods depend on having accurate gene models and some discrepancies could be due to the fact that gene boundaries may be incorrect for up to 20% of genes  <cit> . finally, more puzzling is the poor correlation observed between the three groups of proteome data. whereas rbp <dig> protein is observed at a high level in trophozoites and gametocytes in the a data, it is poorly detected in b and c experiments indicating that the mass methodology used to investigate protein expression probably plays a significant role in these divergent results.

in summary, as could be expected, correlation between the levels of transcripts and proteins is not always observed  <cit>  and this is also true for taps. it has been known for a long time that in eukaryotes gene expression involves regulation at the level of transcription and post-transcription, including maturation, transfer of the mrna into the cytoplasm, as well as translational and post-translational regulation and also at the level of protein half-life. in eukaryotes, protein translation exerts an important control on gene expression from high to low levels of protein amplification depending on the structural characteristics of the mrna, which are far from having been analysed in plasmodium. it is reasonable to think that plasmodium shares with other eukaryotes many features of the machinery of translation accountable for the regulation of protein synthesis. if we focus on translation regulation, some transcripts can be classified as "strong ", i.e. a low level of mrna efficiently translated leading to a marked amplification of the cognate proteins. the reverse is also observed, "weak mrna" expressed at high levels associated to low levels of encoded proteins. this discrepancy between transcript and protein expression can be explained by true regulation at the level of translation, as already reported for some genes and particularly during sexual differentiation  <cit> . however, this can also be explained by limitations of the various experimental high through put approaches and at the moment it is difficult to evaluate the contribution of true translational regulation and/or poor protein evaluation along with its quantification. finally, a huge number of additional functional experiments have to be performed to determine the overall contribution of transcription and translation in gene regulation. that will require real motivation to undertake gene by gene analyses.

vi. analysis of the interactome of all tap
in eukaryotic cells, proteins generally function as part of large protein complexes and this is true for the multifactorial complex machinery of transcription involved in the transcriptional network. in plasmodium, it is reasonable to assume that the taps, as in other eukaryotes, are part of protein complexes. therefore, we searched the literature for protein-protein interactions and interactome reports in plasmodium. only an extremely low number of interactome reports have been published so far based on in silico  <cit>  and yeast two-hybrid  high-throughput experiments  <cit>  and compiled in plasmodb database  <cit> . we extracted from these reports all possible protein interactions and established a network of  <dig> proteins with  <dig> potential interactions . it should be noticed that only four interactions were common to the two studies .

among the  <dig> taps of each class, around half were predicted to interact by in silico and y2h approaches and far more interactions were detected with in silico method . the network of these factors, presented in figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  was constructed as indicated in methods, from the in silico  and y2h  studies. the figure  <dig> is a blow up of interactions between the factors composing the pic and between apiap <dig> with other taps. for the gtfs, the in silico data showed, as expected , significant interactions between a number of rna polymerases and tfii subunits composing the pic, plus interactions with several ctfs and stfs , including several apiap <dig>  zf-c2h <dig> and pfmyb <dig>   <cit> . in contrast, no molecular interaction was detected by the y2h approach between the pic components, strongly highlighting that this experimental procedure missed many interactions and therefore the lack of robustness of the data. figure 4b presents the interactions of the apiap <dig> including three apiap <dig> factors  <cit>  that have been molecularly analysed: apiap <dig> ring  and apiap <dig> early schizont . indeed, very few interactions were depicted in la count's data , for example some members of apiap <dig>  zinc finger and myb as well as several gtfs and ctfs. the rbp <dig> polymerase was shown to interact with the nap- pfb <dig> . the best networks were centred around ada/saga:gcn <dig>  a saga protein  <cit> , ada  and an apiap <dig> . finally, the total lack of overlap between the results based on these two approaches reflects their poor reliability.

in summary, when interactions were investigated among the  <dig> tap, even for the basal machinery of p. falciparum which is conserved in its main components almost certainly generating the pic as in other eukaryotes, the lack of y2h interactions and the lack of overlap between in silico and molecular analyses lead to low, if any, confidence in these data. nevertheless, an improved prediction of interactions would contribute to a new annotation and further functional validation of potential stfs that are without any doubt required, as in other eukaryotes, to govern the level of transcription. however, when interactions between the taps and all plasmodium proteins were examined, far too many protein interactions were observed. this, together with the total absence of overlapping results, suggests the fallacy of both computational and y2h data. further molecular gene analyses are needed to validate the in silico prediction and to improve the deciphering of the transcriptional network. in addition, it is essential that the proteins composing protein complexes are co-expressed within the same stages of the plasmodium development and co-localised within the cell nuclei, information that is still missing. although a few interactions between stfs and dna regulatory elements have been described reporting the potential role in transcriptional regulation, only the target genes of two specific transcription factor pfmyb <dig>  and apiap <dig> , were demonstrated by chip-chip and microarray analysis  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
here, we propose a directory of taps implicated at different levels of plasmodium transcriptional machinery. their expression, throughout the erythrocytic development of plasmodium falciparum, as well as their putative interactions, has been analysed. the final goal was to reconstruct the transcriptional network dedicated to messenger rna expression. the directory is based on all reported annotations that we compared to our own in silico annotation. as indicated in table  <dig> to  <dig>  we listed  <dig> taps including  <dig> new potential taps, showing a high diversity of expression  in their transcript and protein profiles and levels throughout the erythrocytic development and also within diverse members of the same family of taps.

it has been described that the basal machinery of p. falciparum is well conserved with a similar number of components accountable for mrna initiation and elongation of transcription when compared to other eukaryotes  <cit> . in addition, there is a large number of potential components implicated in the epigenetic regulation of genes such as chromatin structuring  and remodelling factors . also, a large number of modifying enzymes of the different components of nucleosomes, such as hats, hdacs, methylases, etc, have been predicted in plasmodium and probably participate in the parasite histone code thereby governing transcription efficiency. on the other hand, around  <dig> proteins constitute the putative set of specific taps, a number lower than that observed in s. cerevisiae the genome of which presents a similar number of genes  <cit> .

most of the in silico identification of plasmodium transcription factors has been determined via pairwise homology comparison with those already reported and listed in eukaryotic databases. therefore, these algorithms miss the factors that are too distant at their amino acid levels. it is known that the structure of a protein is more conserved than its amino acid sequence and a good example was provided when callebaut et al.  <cit>  using a hca process, complemented the annotation of gtfs with  <dig> new proteins not identified by coulson et al.  <cit>  leading to a number of factors similar to that encountered in higher eukaryotes. therefore, one can assume that poor annotation of stfs accounts for the apparent low number in plasmodium. poor annotation of re occurs also in plasmodium, due probably to the high a/t content of the genome. in addition, it is conceivable that a number of re within the promoters are specific and interact with proteins not yet described in the transfac database. improvements in the annotation of re and taps are urgently needed in plasmodium considering their central role in controlling the level of gene expression.

the question as to whether the dynamic control of gene expression in plasmodium is similar to that observed in other eukaryotes remains open. also, a matter of debate is the contribution of epigenetic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation in the synthesis of the proteins in charge of parasite development. several years ago, the dogma in the plasmodium research community was that the contribution of epigenetic and post-transcriptional gene regulation prevails over gene transcriptional regulation involving stfs. nevertheless, each stage of erythrocytic development requires a highly coordinated, time-dependant mechanism to control the expression of mrna of distinct sets of genes as determined by various transcriptome and proteome reports. recently, in addition to the steady state transcript analysis a nuclear run on study was undertaken throughout erythrocytic cycle that showed that transcriptional and post transcriptional regulation including the transcript stability  <cit>  participate in the regulation of gene expression  <cit> .

at the moment it is impossible to attest the supposedly low contribution of stfs in plasmodium since this concept was based on a poor annotation of stfs, as well as of their dna motif counterparts. it should be kept in mind that around 60% of the plasmodium genome contains orphan genes. moreover, in addition to the stfs not yet annotated but corresponding to factors listed in the transfac databank, it is reasonable to imagine that novel res might exist within the parasite promoters probably interacting with as yet uncharacterized stfs. lately, several reports have proposed annotations of dna regulatory elements  <cit> . this regain of interest for res prediction might lead the way to the description of additional specific transcription factors, since both cis and trans regulatory elements via their interaction are engaged in transcription regulation.

the survey of transcriptome and proteome studies points out that, for diverse families of taps among which the sub-units of pic, apiap <dig>  zinc fingers and myb, levels of expression of different members vary markedly throughout the erythrocytic cycle and within sporozoites and gametocytes. some members within tap families are more expressed in sporozoites and/or gametocytes whereas others are more expressed at given times of the erythrocytic cycle. the large diversity of tap expression during the plasmodium biological cycle is essential to understand the functional complexity of gene expression observed during parasite development within the human and mosquito hosts.

finally, the level of transcription is governed by the binding efficiency of each factor with their cognate dna binding motifs, even though epigenetic and post-transcriptional regulations also contribute to gene expression. the diversity of interactions between a given member of a particular stf family and a given dna binding domain of a particular dna motif family, is based on the variation of amino acid and dna sequences including the flanking sequences of each binding site  <cit> . the modulation of expression of the targeted transcripts is the result of the combination of these different interactions. in this context a very promising anti-plasmodial strategy would be to inactivate one or more key sets of tfs with drugs. this would compromise gene regulation and hence the function of numerous downstream genes and vital biological processes, including the development of transmission stages. since several genes would be affected, this type of approach would make it much more difficult for the parasite to develop resistance to the drugs.
