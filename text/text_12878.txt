BACKGROUND
the tol <dig> transposon system has been used extensively to deliver exogenous dna into the germline of zebrafish  <cit> , and more recently for successfully integrating bac dna into the germline of both zebrafish and mice  <cit> . in this method the itol <dig> cassette, comprising of the minimal cis-sequences of tol <dig> in an inverted orientation separated by a ~ <dig> kb spacer, was introduced into a bac using recombination of homologous sequences within the genomic insert dna in the bacterial host  <cit> .

a different strategy to modify genomic dna cloned in bacs uses cre-lox recombination. this method uses the bacterial tn <dig> transposon to introduce exogenous dna, including lox sites, at random locations in the bac  <cit> . the inserted lox sites can in turn be recombined with those endogenous to the bac vector with cre protein to progressively delete insert dna from either end efficiently and selectively  <cit> . the procedure has been used previously to deliver reporter genes and other exogenous dna cassettes such as sequencing primer sites, mammalian cell-selectable antibiotic resistance genes and egfp enhancer-traps precisely at the newly created ends of the dna insert in bacs  <cit> . it is significant that the recombinases involved in this approach, namely tn10-transposase and cre protein, do not act upon sequence repeats and/or other recombinogenic sites in the genomic dna insert to rearrange it. this particular characteristic makes the approach applicable to a wider variety of bacs in the public domain, including those with repeated sequences . here we describe methodology to efficiently place itol <dig> cassettes precisely at the ends of the genomic dna insert using either a loxp or a lox <dig> recombination system. cre-recombination of the endogenous loxp or lox <dig> sites, a constituent of all bacs in the public domain, with the ones inserted by these itol2-tn <dig> transposons simultaneously truncates the dna from the respective end and delivers the itol <dig> cassette. large numbers of bacs progressively truncated from either end, with itol <dig> placed at the newly created end, can thus be obtained in a single experiment.

methods
construction of tn <dig> mini-transposons with itol2kan cassettes in front of either loxp or lox511
the itol2-kan dna cassette was inserted in front of the loxp or lox <dig> site in the previously described tn <dig> transposon plasmids ptnmarkerless <dig>  <cit> , and ptnlox511markerless <dig>  <cit> . the oligonucleotides d  and d  were used to amplify the itol2-kan dna cassette. the  <dig> bp pcr product was flanked by asc i sites, and contained the gene for kanamycin resistance which was in turn flanked by inverted  <dig> bp tol2r and inverted  <dig> bp tol2l  <cit> . this pcr product was inserted into at-cloning vector pcr <dig> . the dna isolated from the clones was digested with asc i enzyme, and the purified dna fragment inserted at the asc i sites of plasmids ptnmarkerless <dig>  and ptnlox511markerless <dig>  both orientations of the itol2-kan insert in each of the plasmids ptnmarkerless <dig> and ptnlox511markerless <dig> were isolated. the mixture of plasmids with both orientations of itol2kan will be designated as ptnloxp-itol2kan and ptnlox511-itol2kan.

functionalizing bacs with egfp gene cassettes
bacs were functionalized with the egfp gene in one of two ways: using egfp enhancer-traps in bac clone ch211-43o <dig> containing zebrafish appb gene  <cit> , or by galk-mediated recombination in bacteria for bac clone ch211-163f <dig> carrying the zebrafish fgf <dig> gene. the fgf <dig> bac was isolated in the host sw  <dig> after being functionalized with the egfp gene using the latter procedure  <cit> . because this host contains a temperature sensitive λ-prophage, the fgf24:egfp bac dna was isolated and re-introduced by electroporation into the dh10b host.

generating bac deletion libraries with ptnloxp-itol2kan and ptnlox511-itol2kan
deletion libraries of egfp-functionalized bacs were made with the itol2kan-tn <dig> transposons as previously described for other bacs using different tn- <dig> transposons  <cit> . the transposon plasmid dnas from ptnloxp-itol2kan and ptnlox511-itol2kan were each separately introduced into the bac clones made competent using the calcium chloride procedure. transformed colonies were selected on lb agar plates containing both chloramphenicol and kanamycin. approximately a thousand transformed colonies were pooled  <cit> , and low density cultures containing chloramphenicol, kanamycin and ampicillin were set up. the cultures were induced with iptg at early log phase of growth, and incubated further for three hours. cells were spun down, re-suspended in one-tenth volume of fresh lb in the absence of antibiotics, and infected with phage p <dig>  two hours into the infection, cells were treated with chloroform and lysed, the supernatant isolated and used to infect fresh ns <dig> cells. these were then plated on lb agar plates containing both chloramphenicol and kanamycin. deletion libraries generated with ptnlox511-itol2kan gave better yields of un-catenated bacs if recovered from the cre-expressing strain ns <dig>  instead of the cre non-expressing strain ns <dig> . several thousand member bac deletion libraries were routinely obtained using this procedure with both ptnloxp-itol2kan and ptnlox511-itol2kan.

analysis of bac dna from deletion libraries
dna from bac clones was isolated and analyzed by field inversion gel electrophoresis  after not i digestion as previously described  <cit> . the not i sites at either end of the original bac are deleted upon lox-cre recombination. the not i sites in the transposon plasmids ptnloxp-itol2kan and ptnlox511-itol2kan are designed such that the bac-vector dna band is altered in size for authentic lox-cre recombinants  <cit> . thus deletions with ptnloxp-itol2kan result in shortening of the bac-vector dna band, while those with ptnlox511-itol2kan become devoid of the vector band . as a result lox-cre independent deletions, and/or rearrangements, occurring within the genomic insert are easily distinguished from authentic lox-cre recombinations originating from an end of insert dna  <cit> .

to identify the newly created end, bac deletions of the desirable size were then sequenced with primers based at the ends of the tn <dig> transposons retained after deletion formation, for example pink end r and green end l in deletions made with ptnloxp-itol2kan and ptnlox511-itol2kan, respectively . orientation of the itol2kan cassette in bac clones was determined by direct sequencing of the bac dna with primers located at the ends of the kanamycin gene and going outwards. these are: tkan1: d  and tkan2: d 

injection of bac dna into zebrafish embryos
dna from chosen bac clones were purified using the qiagen tip procedure described earlier  <cit> , and injected into zebrafish eggs as described earlier  <cit> . bacs functionalized with itol2kan were typically injected with a mixture of 30- <dig> ng/ul bac dna plus 25- <dig> ng/ul transposase mrna into one-cell stage zebrafish embryos using previously described procedures  <cit> .

procedures & primers for the "excision assay" in embryos transiently expressing egfp
excision assay was performed following a previously described procedure  <cit> . primers used for this analysis are: kan629-outfwd: d  and kan186-outrev: d 

analysis of transgenic zebrafish
microscopy: developing embryos were analyzed for egfp expression between  <dig> and  <dig> hours post fertilization, using a nikon diaphot fluorescence microscope with a nikon high pressure mercury lamp as the excitation source. embryos were photographed with a rt spot from diagnostic instruments, michigan, usa.

RESULTS
we have developed novel methodology to introduce the repeat ends of tol <dig> in an inverted orientation  into bacs with high efficiency. the itol <dig> dna cassettes are placed precisely at the ends of the genomic dna insert in bacs, while simultaneously trimming that insert dna end by cre-lox recombination. the end of lesser interest of the insert dna is therefore chosen to introduce itol <dig>  in addition to its ease of manipulation, a key advantage of the procedure is the generation of a large collection of bacs with itol <dig> introduced at the chosen end of the genomic dna insert.

construction of transposon plasmids ptnloxp-itol2kan and ptnlox511-itol2kan
the dna cassette, containing the  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp repeat ends of the vertebrate transposon tol <dig> placed in the inverted orientation and flanking the kanamycin resistance gene , was amplified by pcr. the sequence recognized by the restriction enzyme asc i was built into the 5' end of each primer, as indicated in methods. after sub-cloning in pcr <dig>  vector, the amplified dna was excised and ligated at the unique asc i site of plasmids ptnmarkerless <dig> and ptnlox511markerless <dig> that were described previously  <cit> . the two itol <dig> transposon plasmids, each containing both orientations of the itol2kan cassette at the asc i site, are shown in figure  <dig>  deletion libraries of bacs were generated with a mixture containing both these orientations of itol2kan for either the loxp or lox <dig> tn <dig> plasmids. note that the itol2kan cassette is placed in front of the loxp or lox <dig> sites in the two transposons. thus itol2kan would be retained in the bac dna after lox-cre recombination between the transposed and corresponding endogenous lox-sites at either end of bac genomic inserts. we have previously demonstrated that cross-recombination between loxp and lox <dig> sites using phage-p <dig> generated cre protein during a normal phage infection is negligible  <cit> .

introducing itol2kan at the lox <dig> end of insert dna in bacs
progressive deletions of genomic dna in bacs from either the loxp or lox <dig> end have been described  <cit> . an important feature of the technology is the simplicity of determining exactly where in the bac dna the loxp- or lox511-transposon inserted to create the truncation  <cit> . another significant feature is the ability to precisely introduce reporter genes and other dna cassettes at the newly created end in the large bac clone. the sequence in front of the loxp or lox <dig> arrowhead as shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig> is retained after the recombination event that creates the deletion . the arrow orientation refers to the directionality of the loxp or lox <dig> sequences. this particular feature is used here to place the repeat ends of the vertebrate transposon tol <dig> in the inverted orientation, and flanking a kanamycin resistance gene, at either the loxp or lox <dig> end of the bac dna.

two types of bacs from the zebrafish library were used to demonstrate the efficacy of this method: bacs containing the amyloid precursor protein gene of zebrafish  functionalized with egfp enhancer-traps as described in an earlier study  <cit> , and a bac containing the fgf <dig> gene functionalized with the egfp gene by galk-mediated homologous recombination  <cit> . these are shown schematically in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.

thus a  <dig> kb appb-bac clone with a  <dig> kb genomic insert dna, containing the basal promoter egfp gene regulated by ~ <dig> kb upstream dna of the appb gene, was chosen for insertion of itol2kan at the lox <dig> end . when injected into zebrafish embryos, dna from this and similar clones expressed gfp fluorescence exclusively in neurons  <cit> . plasmid dna from ptnlox511-itol2kan was introduced into this bac clone using calcium chloride transformation as previously described  <cit> . a deletion library comprising of at least  <dig> clones was isolated from the itol2kan transposon plasmid transformed bac culture using procedures described previously  <cit> . dna was isolated from clones of this library and analyzed by fige. arrays of bac deletions, each containing the itol2kan at the lox <dig> end and the egfp gene at the loxp end of genomic insert dna, are shown in figure 4a. note that cre recombination of lox <dig> sites, one endogenous to bac vector and the other transposed by tnlox511-itol2kan, deletes the not i site existing at the lox <dig> end of the starting bac dna. consequently a separate not i-not i vector dna band is not present in deletion clone dna in the fige gels of panels a and b of figure  <dig>  clone dnas shown in fige panels a and b were obtained from libraries made with different appb bacs that contained the egfp enhancer-trap located either  <dig>  kb upstream , or  <dig> kb upstream  of the transcription start site of the appb gene . both orientations of the itol2kan cassette were found in clones in the fige arrays shown in panels a and b of figure  <dig>  this was determined by direct sequencing of the bac dna using primers, tkan <dig> or tkan <dig>  located at the ends of the kanamycin gene in the itol2kan cassette and going outwards. in approximately half the clones, sequencing with either tkan <dig> or tkan <dig> primer helped determine the location of the newly created end in the appb bac made by ptnlox511-itol2kan in the appb gene region of chromosome  <dig> of zebrafish. blast analysis was used to identify these locations , which were consistent with the size of the bacs estimated from the markers in the fige arrays shown in figure  <dig> panels a and b.

introducing itol2kan at the loxp end of insert dna in bacs
the appb bacs functionalized with egfp enhancer-traps at the loxp end of genomic insert could not be used to introduce itol <dig> cassettes again at the loxp end. using the loxp-itol2kan transposon on these bacs would only delete the egfp enhancer-trap reporter cassette. therefore a zebrafish bac clone functionalized with the egfp gene by galk-mediated homologous recombination was selected to introduce itol2kan at the loxp end . the open reading frame of egfp gene was fused to the initiator codon of the fgf <dig> gene in this bac. the transposon plasmid ptnloxp-itol2kan, shown schematically in figure  <dig>  was introduced into the fgf24:egfp bac using the calcium chloride transformation procedure. note that the fgf24:egfp bac dna was isolated from the host sw  <dig>  and re-introduced by electroporation into dh10b cells to avoid potential complications arising from the temperature sensitive λ-prophage in the previous host .

a deletion library of several thousand members was generated with fgf24:egfp bac using ptnloxp-itol2kan, as described earlier  <cit> . analysis of deletion clone dna by fige after not i digestion is shown in panel c of figure  <dig>  because the egfp cassette was introduced at fgf <dig> translation start site, it was important to isolate clones with genomic insert dna longer than  <dig> kb . therefore only clones that fulfill this criterion are shown in the fige of figure 4c.

the fgf24:egfp bac deletions shown in panel c were sequenced with transposon based primer, seq  <dig>  <cit> , to determine the location of the newly created end containing the itol2kan cassette on the fgf <dig> bac dna. blast analysis of sequences helped determine their locations on a chromosomal map . these were consistent with the size of clone dna in figure  <dig>  panel c.

expression analysis of itol2-containing appb:egfp bac and fgf24:egfp bac in zebrafish embryos
deletion clone dnas marked with the blue arrowheads, in panels a, b and c of figure  <dig>  were further purified using the qiagen-tip procedure  <cit> , and injected into zebrafish eggs for expression and/or "excision assay" analyses along with mrna capable of expressing tol <dig> transposase  <cit> .

excision assay analyses to confirm authentic recognition of itol2-ends by tol <dig> -transposase
recognition and processing of the bac dna, containing the itol2kan cassette, by the tol <dig> transposase enzyme upon entry into zebrafish oocytes can be evaluated using the "excision assay"  <cit> . thus the embryos injected with dna from appb:egfp bac and fgf24:egfp bac were analyzed using the "excision assay". the results shown in the lower panels of figure  <dig> clearly indicate that all of the bac dnas tested were processed by the tol <dig> transposase. transient expression patterns of embryos analyzed with the excision assay are shown in panels a-d of figure  <dig>  the results demonstrate that itol2kan at lox511-end for bacs  <dig> and  <dig>  and the loxp-end for clones  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, are recognized accurately by the tol <dig> transposase. note that bacs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are larger than  <dig> kb.

germline expressions of itol <dig> containing bacs
transgenic zebrafish lines were established from injections of egfp bac dnas shown in lanes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in fige panels a, b and c of figure  <dig>  respectively. the egfp fluorescence of the f <dig> zebrafish lines are shown in figure  <dig>  panels a-c, for bac clones  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively. expression of egfp fluorescence is restricted to neurons and highly specific to the hind brain and spinal cord in f <dig> transgenic zebrafish created from injections of itol2-appb:egfp bacs  <dig> and  <dig>  as seen in panels a and b of figure  <dig>  the slight difference in the expression patterns observed in the two panels might be due to the different appb bacs used; clones  <dig> and  <dig> have dna extending till  <dig>  kb and  <dig> kb upstream of the appb transcription start site, respectively.

germline expression of itol <dig> retrofitted fgf24:egfp bac clone  <dig> is shown in figure 6c. f <dig> embryos from injections with fgf24:egfp bac  <dig> dna showed gfp expression patterns almost identical to those from injections with full length fgf24:egfp bac dna that had the itol <dig> cassette introduced by galk mediated recombination . taken together, the results indicate that bacs larger than  <dig> kb are not only recognized and processed effectively by the tol <dig> transposase, but are also integrated efficiently into the zebrafish chromosome when itol <dig> is introduced into the bac dna ends using a loxp or lox <dig> tn <dig> transposon.

discussion
we have developed a novel approach to rapidly introduce repeat ends of the vertebrate transposon tol <dig>  in an inverted orientation, at the ends of bac dna. the tn <dig> transposons used for the purpose carry both itol <dig> ends and lox sites that can be recombined by cre protein with the corresponding lox sites endogenous to the bac vector and flanking the genomic dna insert. as the insertions of these itol2-tn <dig> transposons into genomic dna in bacs appear to be largely random , large collections of bacs with itol <dig> at the newly trimmed end are generated in a single experiment. such libraries are uniquely suited for functionally mapping long-range gene regulatory sequences using transgenic animals. thus multiple bacs from a contig spanning a genetic locus should enable such functional analyses to be extended over large regions of the genome. the approach does not require selecting sequences for mutational analyses to test their gene regulatory potential, and is therefore unbiased. it enables enhancer-trap containing bacs, or bacs retrofitted with egfp cassettes using sequence homology based recombination, to be readily converted into deletion libraries with integrated itol <dig> ready for chromosome integration. compared to traditional approaches for enhancer-trapping used with whole genomes in animals , our approach using enhancer-traps in individual bacs has the potential to allow a more uniform coverage of the genome because the baseline efficiency of trap insertion is reset for individual bacs in the bacterial host. although there appear to be vast regions of the genome refractory to enhancer-trapping by traditional means, to date we have not encountered bacs refractory to tn <dig> transposon insertions.

the itol <dig> insertions into bac dna are performed using tn <dig> transposons carrying loxp or lox <dig> sites, and do not rely upon sequences existing in the genomic inserts of bacs. consequently, the tn <dig> transposons developed here are applicable to all bacs in the public domain. this feature is unlike the targeting vectors used in methods based on recombining homologous sequences, which need to be constructed anew for each bac. the use of radioactive isotopes is also prevented, as southern blotting is not required in retrofitting bacs using tn <dig> transposons.

varying degrees of promiscuity in recombining different mutant lox sites, including the lox <dig> mutant with wild type loxp, using both partially purified cre-extracts in vitro  <cit> , and cre over-expressed in cells  <cit>  have been reported. for example, cross recombination between loxp and lox <dig> has been reported to occur at efficiencies ranging from  <dig> to 100% under those experimental conditions that express cre constitutively  <cit> . we have not observed such cross-recombination. high levels of stringency in vivo in recombining identical lox sites  <cit> , or lox sites with at least identical spacers  <cit> , have been achieved with cre protein expressed from its native source, namely a phage p <dig> infection  <cit> . depending on whether a loxp or a lox <dig> transposon is used, truncations from the corresponding lox- end of insert dna in bacs can be made readily and exclusively with high stringency. thus insertions of itol <dig> with the resulting truncations of genomic dna from either end are not only efficient, but also highly specific to that end.

a notable drawback of the transposon based approach appears to stem from the very feature that makes it so efficient: the p <dig> headful packaging strategy used to isolate the functionalized bac so easily also limits the size of the bac clone that can be analyzed to ~  <dig> kb. although the genomic dna insert is truncated in the process to a size of ~ <dig> kb, the remainder bac vector, it is unlikely to be a disadvantage in most applications because a majority of vertebrate genes can be housed in their entirety within this size limit. we note that almost half of evolutionarily conserved non-coding gene-regulatory sequences in vertebrate genomes  <cit> , and probably a similar fraction of those that are conserved in function and shape but not in sequence  <cit> , are located within this span of dna adjoining transcription start sites of genes.

it is clear that the transposon retrofitting strategy and those based on homologous recombination have strengths that appear somewhat complimentary in nature. therefore a judicious approach might be to use a combination of the two methodologies, as demonstrated here for the fgf24:egfp bac and in an earlier study  <cit> . the procedures described here should allow one to readily generate libraries of egfp functionalized bacs, progressively truncated from an end and carrying the itol <dig> cassette, ready for integration into chromosomes of at least fish and mice  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the repeat ends of the tol <dig> transposon in the inverted orientation, and flanking a kanamycin resistance gene , was introduced by a novel procedure to the ends of bac dna. we show that these itol <dig> inserted bacs are efficiently recognized by the tol <dig> transposase, and successfully integrate into the germline of zebrafish. compared to previous methods using recombination of homologous sequences to introduce itol <dig> ends into bacs, our lox-cre recombination approach rapidly generates, in a single experiment, a large collection of bacs with itol <dig> placed at an end that is also progressively truncated. the libraries of itol <dig> inserted bacs generated should facilitate integration of trimmed single genes into the germline, and help functionally map cis-acting gene regulatory sequences in animals. the approach should be applicable to a wider variety of bacs, including those with sequence repeats.
