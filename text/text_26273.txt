BACKGROUND
of only a handful of plant sex chromosome systems that have been investigated at the molecular level, the xy chromosome system of silene latifolia is one of the best-studied  <cit> . however, finding sex-linked genes in this species has been a slow process and is still ongoing. approaches such as screening cdna libraries with probes from microdissected s. latifolia y chromosomes identified only a few sex-linked genes . segregation analysis of intron variants and snps within plant families revealed more sex-linked genes . altogether, these approaches yielded about  <dig> validated s. latifolia sex-linked genes.

recently, however, three studies used rna-seq to identify hundreds of s. latifolia sex-linked genes, either using segregation patterns within families  <cit>  or male and female full siblings from an inbred population  <cit> . sex-linked genes were identified either by following allele transmission from parents to their progeny , or by searching for snps homozygous in females and heterozygous in males, indicating y-linkage  <cit> . as no s. latifolia reference genome is available, these searches started with either a de novo assembled reference transcriptome using the s. latifolia rna-seq data  <cit>  or using  <dig> est data from s. vulgaris, a close relative without sex chromosomes  <cit> , to map the s. latifolia reads and perform snp-calling. both approaches are subject to errors, especially when sex-linkage of a contig is inferred from the segregation pattern of only a single snp, so the inferences were assessed by checking for complete sex-linkage of some of the inferred sex-linked genes, using pcr on sets of unrelated males and females  <cit> . further tests were done to check whether “tester sets” of well-validated sex-linked and autosomal genes  were correctly assigned . the results were encouraging, with most genes tested being correctly assigned. however, only a few newly inferred genes  were checked experimentally, and the tester sets included only 10– <dig> sex-linked and 0- <dig> autosomal genes. moreover, the rna-seq studies focused on rna from only one tissue  and any sex-linked genes not expressed in flower buds, or expressed at low levels, must be missed .

the number of sex-linked genes in s. latifolia is therefore not yet accurately known. an alternative approach to discovering new sex-linked genes is to sequence bac clones from the sex chromosomes. a handful of bacs from the s. latifolia x and y chromosomes have already been sequenced , and they yielded few new sex-linked genes. to improve the yield, we screened a bac library with probes from validated x-linked or y-linked genes of s. latifolia, which establishes sex-linkage of all genes found in the bac sequences. identifying both x-linked and y-linked genes is important for estimating the proportion of x-linked genes that have lost their y counterparts, indicating y genetic degeneration of this plant sex chromosome system. sequencing bacs should help identify genes with low expression levels, some of which were probably missed by previous studies, because most sex-linked genes identified so far in s. latifolia come from cdna, ests or rna-seq data, which will be enriched for highly expressed genes. sequencing the complete s. latifolia sex chromosomes using bacs would be extremely costly as the x is 400 mb, and the y 550 mb. however, bac sequencing to obtain sequences of portions of the sex chromosomes is very useful. in particular, it can provide larger tester set to compare with results from rna-seq studies , as well as for analyses  for estimating changes in gene densities during the evolution of the x and y chromosomes, and gene losses from the y chromosome.

we obtained ~4 mb of bac sequences from the s. latifolia sex chromosomes and from silene vulgaris, a closely related non-dioecious plant without sex chromosomes, in order to identify both new sex-linked genes and their s. vulgaris homologs, which can serve as outgroup sequences for comparing the evolution of s. latifolia x-linked and y-linked genes. a bac library from a s. latifolia male was screened using probes specific for x-linked and y-linked alleles of  <dig> previously validated x/y gene pairs . orthologs of all  <dig> genes have been identified in s. vulgaris, all mapping to a single linkage group  <cit> , indicating that they were all on the ancestral proto-sex chromosomes, and not gained during the evolution of the s. latifolia sex chromosomes. their map locations in s. latifolia indicate that they represent all evolutionary strata  previously described for this species  <cit>  . annotation of the bac sequences yielded  <dig> new x-linked genes and  <dig> new y-linked genes. we analysed the gene densities of the x-linked, y-linked and s. vulgaris bacs. we also searched by blast the previously published rna-seq data with the sequences of the new sex-linked genes in the bacs, and used the results to develop a new, combined approach to estimate y gene loss. the results of our re-evaluation suggests that gene loss may have been underestimated based on rna-seq alone, although more work is still needed to get a precise estimate of y gene loss in s. latifolia.

RESULTS
obtaining s. latifolia x and y genomic sequences and identifying genes
a total of  <dig> positive bac clones were selected and sequenced . after further validation ,  <dig> clones were retained for analysis. these included  <dig> triplets of x/y/vulgaris sequences, one x/vulgaris pair, one y/vulgaris pair, and two single x bac clones without y chromosome or s. vulgaris homologs . the  <dig> sex-linked chromosomal fragments sequenced total ~ <dig>  mb, the largest set of s. latifolia sex-linked genomic sequences so far obtained. these bac sequences were assembled and annotated , revealing a total of  <dig> genes,  <dig> of which are from s. vulgaris. including the probe genes, the s. latifolia genes total  <dig> x-linked and  <dig> y-linked genes .  <dig> of them are newly identified in s. latifolia, tripling the number of s. latifolia fully sex-linked genes with complete genomic sequences;  <dig> of these  <dig> new sex-linked genes are x-linked, and  <dig> are y-linked.table  <dig> gene number and density in s. latifolia x and y and in s. vulgaris bac clones

s. vulgaris
gene density was computed using all available bac data. when only triplets are used, the results are similar



an all-against-all blast search among the bac-located genes revealed conserved blocks of several tens of kb around each probe gene in the s. latifolia x and s. vulgaris bac sequences . these blocks include  <dig> new x-vulgaris homologous gene pairs . when aligning x-linked and s. vulgaris sequences using mauve , we found conserved gene orders in the blocks around the probe genes, and sequence similarities in the intergenic regions. in contrast, blast searching found only two new y-vulgaris gene pairs , and mauve alignments found similarity between y and s. vulgaris sequences mostly restricted to the probe gene itself . this suggests the occurrence of insertions, deletions and other chromosomal rearrangements of the s. latifolia y chromosome at a small  scale, in addition to the large-scale rearrangements previously found .

to directly evaluate the extent of gene losses from the s. latifolia y chromosome, we first searched for x/y gene pairs , where one is clearly recognizable as a pseudogene. we found no such pairs. all pseudogenes found in the bac sequences were duplicates of other genes in the same bac clone. the only x/y gene pairs in our bac sequences are the “probe” genes, which were already known ; none of the new x-linked genes have gametologs in the corresponding y chromosome bac sequence .

assembling bacs from the x <dig>  x <dig> and x6a regions and implications for the number of pseudoautosomal regions in s. latifolia sex chromosomes
we found overlaps between the x bac sequences from three probes, genes x <dig>  x <dig> and x6a. these bac sequences were therefore assembled into a scaffold . the end of this scaffold  consists of x <dig>  repeats typical of silene telomeres  <cit> . these x <dig>  repeats probably represent the x telomere, based on the following reasoning. bac assembly and sequencing statistics indicate that 7 % of reads in bac65p <dig> are from x <dig> , yielding an estimate that the x <dig>  repeat forms a ~6 kb region of this bac. no interstitial x. <dig>  signal was detected on the x chromosome in previous work using fish  <cit> , but a 6 kb sequence composed of units arranged in tandem should yield a clear fluorescent signal with the x <dig>  probe. a non-telomeric location is therefore unlikely. our results therefore suggest that we have reached the end of the xq arm in s. latifolia. in turn, this implies that only the xp end is pseudoautosomal. our results are therefore consistent with the s. latifolia sex chromosomes having only a single pseudoautosomal region, and not two as aflp mapping suggested  <cit> ; a single pseudoautosomal region  is consistent with the latest genetic mapping  <cit>  .

gene densities in s. latifolia x, y and s. vulgaris bac clones
we found an average of  <dig> genes/mb in the s. latifolia x bac sequences and  <dig> genes/mb in those from s. vulgaris . the gene densities we observed in both species’ bac sequences are quite high, which suggests that we have sequenced gene-dense regions. the  <dig> -fold lower gene density in the s. latifolia x is, however, consistent with the expectation based purely on the genome sizes of the two species . assuming the same total number of genes in both species , and neglecting possible inter-chromosomal translocations in s. latifolia or s. vulgaris  <cit> , the relative total genome sizes predict a  <dig> -fold lower gene density in s. latifolia.

in contrast, the s. latifolia y bacs have an estimated average gene density of only  <dig> genes/mb ,  <dig>  times lower than the x. the s. latifolia y chromosome is 550 mb, considerably larger than the x . if the number of genes were the same on both sex chromosomes , the ratio of gene densities for y versus x should be the same as the ratio of y/x chromosome sizes, 550/ <dig>  predicting a mean y density  <dig>  times lower than that of the x. the observed value in the s. latifolia y bac sequences is nevertheless considerably lower than the expectation, and suggests losses of as much as 34 % of genes from the y.

searching for the bac-located genes in rna-seq data
we blasted our bac-located genes to the rna-seq contigs from previous studies , which produced significant matches for  <dig> out of  <dig> genes , showing that most of our bac-located genes  are expressed in flower buds. only half of these genes were identified as sex-linked by any of the previous studies . as predicted  the genes not detected as sex-linked in any of the rna-seq studies have much lower expression levels  than those where sex-linkage was detected . this suggests that failure to ascertain genes as sex-linked when they have low expression affects inferences using rna-seq, in addition to absence of expression of some genes in flower buds.table  <dig> comparison of bac and rna-seq data

all bac-located genes are included except the six probe genes for which both x and y copies were already available. m2012: muyle et al.  <dig> , bc2011: bergero, charlesworth  <dig> , cf2011: chibalina, filatov  <dig> 


aamong those  <dig>  two genes were found to be x-hemizygous in  <cit> , and xy in  <cit> . in the combined data , we considered these genes to be xy



re-evaluating y gene loss using both bac and rna-seq data
two rna-seq studies have used x-linked genes to estimate y gene loss in s. latifolia. only  <dig> to 20 % of x-linked genes were estimated to have no y transcripts, suggesting that y degeneration and male hemizygosity may be modest in s. latifolia  <cit> . correct inference of x-hemizygous genes is critical for reliably estimating y gene loss. if the y copy of an x/y gene pair is not expressed, or is expressed at low levels in the tissue used for rna-seq analysis, hemizygosity will be incorrectly inferred and gene losses from the y will be overestimated. we found some examples of this when comparing the bac and rna-seq data . two bac-located genes matched contigs inferred as x/y gene pairs from one study but with contigs inferred as x-hemizygous in others, and one y-linked gene matched a contig inferred as x-hemizygous .

among our x-linked bac-located genes, five matched contigs inferred to be x-hemizygous . using our bac-located genes that match rna-seq contigs detected as sex-linked, this yields an estimate of 20 % of y gene loss, the same as in the published rna-seq studies  <cit> . however, if coverage is low due to a low expression level, snps may not be identified; individuals cannot then be genotyped and no inferences about sex-linkage are possible. recent data from animals suggests that average expression levels are lower for x-hemizygous genes than for x/y gene pairs  <cit> , and therefore the rna-seq approach may fail to detect x-hemizygous genes more often than x/y gene pairs, resulting in an underestimation of gene losses from the y. if this bias occurs, the bac-located genes not matching contigs inferred as sex-linked should include more x-hemizygous genes than the ~20 % estimate above.

to evaluate this possibility, it would be helpful to have an estimate of the proportion of x-hemizygous genes that were undetected by the rna-seq studies. when these studies were done, very few validated x-hemizygous genes were available in s. latifolia. only two fully degenerated y-linked genes in s. latifolia have so far been documented  <cit> . two recent studies used segregation analysis in large families and inferred further x-hemizygous genes, one being a segregation analysis using radseq data  <cit> ; however  comparing these genes with the sex-linked contigs from rna-seq studies reveals that ~57 % might be x/y gene pairs, so we cannot use them as well-validated x-hemizygous genes . 

we therefore used an indirect approach. many well-validated x/y gene pairs are now available, and can be used to estimate the probability that the combined rna-seq studies fail to detect such a gene pair. given this estimate, one can infer how many of the bac-located genes that do not match sex-linked rna-seq contigs could represent such missed x/y gene pairs, and thus how many are probably truly x-hemizygous genes . for the required estimate, we used all published well-validated x/y gene pairs: the  <dig> experimentally validated ones ,  <dig> sex-linked contigs from rna-seq studies that were validated by pcr  <cit> , and  <dig> more from a recent segregation analysis  <cit> . all these are probably highly expressed genes. we added  <dig> more x/y gene pairs from the radseq study  <cit> , which uses genomic dna, and can therefore ascertain genes even if their expression levels are low, for a total of  <dig> tester genes that were previously inferred as sex-linked. 78 % of these genes had significant matches with contigs from at least one of the three rna-seq studies, implying that they are expressed in flower buds. genes matching contigs not assigned as sex-linked in one study often matched sex-linked ones in another, so that only around 25 % of true x/y gene pairs remained undetected in the three rna-seq studies combined .

this estimated proportion suggests that, out of our total number of  <dig> new x-linked bac-located genes expressed in flower buds,  <dig> *43 =  <dig>  are probably x/y gene pairs undetected in the combined rna-seq data. thus,  <dig>  of the  <dig> bac-located genes not matching sex-linked rna-seq contigs  in table 3) are accounted for. this leaves  <dig> –  <dig>  =  <dig>  genes that are probably x-hemizygous, but failed to be detected by the rna-seq studies. only x-linked genes newly ascertained by our bac sequencing are “ancestral” genes relevant for estimating gene losses ; there were probably  <dig> “ancestral” genes in our bac sequences,  <dig> x bac-located genes that lack copies in our y bacs but have rna-seq matches, plus the  <dig> y-only bac-located genes with rna-seq matches . the estimated number of y gene losses is then as follows:  <dig> genes detected as x-hemizygous  in table 3) +  <dig>  x-hemizygous genes that failed to be detected by the rna-seq studies . dividing by  <dig> ancestral genes yields 33 % . using a similar approach to estimate gene losses from the x chromosome gives a considerably lower fraction, 5 % , significantly different from the estimate for the y . estimates of ancestral gene numbers are particularly reliable when an outgroup is used to exclude genes that were gained after the sex chromosomes originated, by duplication and/or relocation onto the x. we therefore repeated this analysis, restricting it to genes with homologs on the s. vulgaris bac sequences . the results are similar; excluding the “probe” genes, we estimate 34 % gene loss from the y, and none from the x .table  <dig> analysis of gene loss in x and y chromosomes combining bac and rna-seq data

correct estimation of the proportion of x-hemizygous genes among the bac-located genes depends on the representativeness of the x/y gene pairs used as tester set. to check further our set of inferred x-hemizygous genes, we searched for genes that were wrongly classified as x-hemizygous, but which were actually x/y gene pairs whose sequences are so diverged that they assembled into different contigs, one of which  was not detected. rna-seq contigs representing the y copies of these x-hemizygous genes should be found only in males. to test for such sequences among the rna-seq contigs, we examined the bac-located genes that the published rna-seq analyses did not ascertain as sex-linked by blasting them against a set of rna-seq contigs that were found only in males . this yielded only between  <dig> and  <dig> significant matches . thus, very few potentially highly diverged y copies are present among the rna-seq contigs; moreover, some of the male-specific contigs may not represent divergent y copies but may simply be autosomal paralogs specifically expressed in males. the lack of evidence for the existence of many undetected x/y gene pairs with diverged y-linked copies agrees with our estimate that no more than  <dig> of the genes not ascertained as sex-linked by rna-seq analysis are actually x/y gene pairs .

CONCLUSIONS
our bac sequencing effort resulted in  <dig> new validated sex-linked genes in s. latifolia, adding to the  <dig> already published ones available . comparing our new genes to sex-linked genes identified by rna-seq studies shows that failure to ascertain genes as sex-linked when they have low expression is an important limitation of rna-seq, in addition to non-expression in the flower bud tissues that have been used, illustrating the difficulty of reliably inferring sex-linkage, x-hemizygosity and gene loss from the y chromosome without a reference genome. analyses to take this ascertainment bias into account suggest that gene losses from the s. latifolia y could be higher than previously thought, perhaps around 30 %, consistent with the gene densities in x/y and s. vulgaris bacs. however, further work is needed to estimate y gene loss in this species more precisely.
