BACKGROUND
members of the genus xanthomonas are capable of infecting at least  <dig> monocot species and  <dig> dicot species and provide excellent case studies for understanding plant-microbe interactions  <cit> . among the diseases caused by xanthomonas, citrus canker caused by x. citri subsp. citri   is an important disease that has severe economic impact on citrus industries worldwide. asiatic  type strains are the most widespread and, hence, the most destructive form of citrus canker. the strains induce hyperplasic and hypertrophic  lesions surrounded by oily or water-soaked margins and a yellow halo on leaves, stems, and fruits. besides xcc, a second species, x. fuscans subsp. aurantifolii , is also known to cause citrus canker with limited geographic distribution and limited host range. type b strains of xau are restricted to south america  and cause canker on lemon  and mexican lime . type b strains can also be found on sweet orange  and grapefruit   <cit> . type c strains of xau are restricted to brazil and cause canker only on mexican lime  <cit> .

two variants of type a strains have also been identified. the variant designated a* was found in southeast asia in the 1990s infecting mexican lime  <cit> . a second variant, designated as the “wellington strain”, was isolated from palm beach county in southern florida  <cit> . dna hybridization analysis showed that xcaw is more closely related to xcca and xcca* strains than to xaub and xauc strains  <cit> . both xcaw and xcca have similar symptoms and leaf populations on mexican lime  <cit> . x. citri subsp. citri pathotype aw  are pathogenic on mexican lime and alemow  but not on grapefruit and sweet orange. the xcaw strains cause a hypersensitive reaction  in grapefruit  <cit> . the gene avrgf <dig> was identified in xcaw strain  <dig>  and mutation of avrgf <dig> of xcaw <dig> rendered the mutant virulent on grapefruit, although the symptoms were much reduced as compared to symptoms due to strains of xcca <dig>  <cit> . a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for the differences in virulence and host range of xcaw and xcca is lacking.

comparative genomic analyses of xanthomonads have greatly facilitated our understanding of the virulence factors and host range determinants of different pathogens  <cit> . comparative genomic analysis of x. campestris pv. campestris and xcca <dig> has been conducted previously to understand the mechanisms of different host range and pathogenic processes of the two xanthomonas species, which have distinct host ranges  <cit> . compared to xcc, which infects citrus and causes citrus canker, x. campestris pv. campestris affects crucifers such as brassica and causes black rot. numerous species-specific genes have been identified which might explain the differing host specificities and pathogenic processes of the two pathogens. comparative genomic analysis of xcca <dig> and x. axonopodis pv. citrumelo was also conducted recently  <cit> . x. axonopodis pv. citrumelo f <dig> is a nursery infecting strain and shows low virulence on citrus compared to that of xcca. differences in gene contents, such as type iii effectors , the type iv secretion system, and lipopolysaccharide synthesis were identified and may contribute to the differences in bacterial virulence and host range  <cit> . furthermore, sequencing of xaub and xauc strains identified different virulence factors affecting host range of closely related species  <cit> .

here we conducted comparative genomic analysis of xcaw <dig> and the closely related strain xcca <dig> using a complete genome sequence of xcaw <dig> to understand the difference in virulence and host range. recently, we have completed the genome sequencing of xcaw <dig>  <cit> . we further examined the transcriptomes of both xcca <dig> and xcaw <dig> by rna-seq in nutrient rich condition nutrient broth  and in xvm <dig>  which is known to induce hrp gene expression  <cit> . the comparative genomic and transcriptome analyses will provide the foundation to further characterize the mechanisms for virulence and host range of pathotypes of x. citri subsp. citri.

RESULTS
multi locus sequencing typing analysis
multi locus sequence typing  based phylogenetic analysis was performed for xcaw <dig> and other xanthomonas spp. using nine housekeeping genes  that are highly conserved in bacteria. the nine protein sequences were aligned and concatenated and then used to construct a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree . the results showed that xcaw <dig> is closely related to xcca <dig>  interestingly, these two citrus canker pathogens form a clade with x. citri pv. mangiferaeindicae lmg  <dig> and x. axonopodis pv. punicae lmg  <dig>  which cause bacterial black spot in mango and bacterial leaf blight in pomegranates respectively. both strains were isolated from india  <cit> , a putative origin of xcca. hence, it is possible that these pathogens have evolved from the same ancestor and evolved to adapt to different hosts. the xcca <dig> and xcaw <dig> strains share close relationship with the other two citrus canker causing bacteria xaub and xauc . the close relationship between xcca, xcaw, xaub and xauc agrees with the genome-based phylogeny of the genus xanthomonas <cit> .

chromosome organization and genome plasticity
whole-genome alignment of xcaw <dig> to closely related xcca <dig> using mauve in progressive mode revealed numerous inversions and translocations . most of the separated blocks in the alignment are associated with integrases and/or is elements on at least one of their borders. the is elements have been known to aid horizontal gene transfer and other genome rearrangements  <cit> .

xcaw <dig> genome contains two plasmids pxcaw <dig> and pxcaw <dig> that are significantly different from the plasmids found in xcca <dig>  plasmid pxcaw <dig> sequence has no similarity with the plasmids of xcca <dig>  whereas pxcaw <dig> is only about 35% similar to pxac <dig>  plasmid pxcaw <dig> contains the pthaw <dig> gene, a homolog of ptha <dig>  which is capable of conferring the ability to cause canker-like symptoms  <cit> . however, the plasmid pxcaw <dig> does not contain the vir like type iv secretion system genes found on pxac <dig>  the type iv secretion system has been shown to contribute to virulence in x. campestris pv. campestris strain  <dig>  <cit>  and absence of these genes from the plasmid could affect virulence of xcaw <dig> strain.

three clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats  with short  direct repeats interspaced with unrelated similarly sized non-repetitive sequences  are found in xcaw <dig> genome . the crispr <dig> and crispr <dig> repeats are also present in xcca <dig>  crispr <dig> and crispr <dig> from xcaw <dig> are identical except for a g at the beginning of crispr <dig>  indicating that it might be a recent duplication. crispr is a bacterial immunity system that helps exclude foreign genetic elements. however the variability in xcaw <dig> and xcca <dig> suggests that the strains might have had dissimilar exposure to foreign genetic material as suggested in x. oryzae <cit> .

the tblastn analysis of all the proteins from xcaw <dig> and xcca <dig> revealed various gene clusters specific to each strain. of the  <dig>  proteins from xcaw <dig> and  <dig>   proteins from xcca <dig>   <dig>  proteins are found to be orthologous using the cut-off e-value ≤ 10- <dig> and alignments >60% sequence identity, >60% query gene length. among the  <dig>  common proteins,  <dig>  were annotated in xcca <dig>  <cit>  whereas  <dig> are not annotated. xcaw <dig> has  <dig> proteins that are either non-orthologous to proteins from xcca <dig> or unique, whereas xcca <dig> has  <dig> such proteins.

the hrp and hrc genes encoding the type  <dig> secretion system  in xcaw <dig> are homologous to the hrp and hrc genes found in xcca <dig>  all the genes are found in similar order with the exception in gene annotation between hrpf and hpab. the genome of xcca <dig> contains the annotated gene xac <dig> between the two, which is a hypothetical protein. the annotation in xcaw <dig> in the same region is on the opposite strand and contains hpai  and xopf <dig>  which may be nonfunctional due to a frameshift. the nucleotide sequences in both strains are the same and the differences in annotation were confirmed by blast similarity of the annotated genes in xcaw <dig> to other xanthomonads.

the t3ss translocates effector proteins into the plant cells. the effectors can either aid in nutrient acquisition and virulence or act as avirulence factors that trigger host immune response  <cit> . the type iii effector genes in xcaw <dig> were predicted by blast analysis against the known t3ss effector database . xcaw <dig> contains thirty effector genes of which twenty-six overlap with xcca <dig> . nineteen effectors are present in all four sequenced citrus canker causing variants compared  and thus represent the core effector set for xanthomonas that cause citrus canker. it is noteworthy that escalon et al.  <cit>  define a ‘common repertoire’ of  <dig> t3s effector genes present in  <dig> xcc strains from several locations around the world. they did not use data from xaub and xauc in compiling this common repertoire which explains why  <dig> t3s effectors were identified previously  <cit>  whereas we only identified  <dig> common t3s effectors. the effector genes avrbs <dig>  xopk, xopl, xopq, xopr, xopx and xopz are found in all other sequenced xanthomonas genomes and hence these seven genes might be a core set of effectors required for phytopathogenicity as suggested by moreira et al. <cit> . twelve effector genes  are present in all four citrus canker causing variants . of the twelve effector genes, xope <dig> and xopai are present in xcaw <dig> albeit in different locations as compared to the potential genomic island in the other three strains causing citrus canker. however they may play a role in citrus canker as suggested by moreira et al. <cit> . two effector genes avrgf <dig> and xopaf were identified in xcaw, xaub and xauc but were not present in xcca <dig> genome .

multiple genes clustered into ten groups were identified in xcaw <dig> but not in xcca <dig> . many genes of these clusters present in xcaw <dig> but not in xcca <dig> have homologs in other xanthomonas species. all these regions contain transposase, integrase or phage related genes indicating possible acquisition by horizontal gene transfer. an interesting difference noted in the above-mentioned regions is in cluster  <dig>  which encodes for lipopolysaccharide  biosynthetic pathway. interestingly, the lps cluster in xcaw <dig> contains regions orthologous to both xcca <dig> and x. oryzae pv. oryzicola bls <dig> as shown in figure  <dig>  which indicates that there has been horizontal gene transfer. cluster  <dig> is almost  <dig> kb long and parts of cluster  <dig> are syntenic with regions from x. campestris pv. campestris  <dig>  a black spot pathogen of cabbage . a mummer comparison between cluster  <dig> and x. campestris pv. campestris  <dig> shows high synteny . three transcriptional regulators  and one two-component system  sensor kinase  and its response regulator  are present in xcaw <dig>  but are absent in xcca <dig> 

ptha and homologs
all the citrus canker causing variants  contain ptha or its functional homologs. thus, ptha or its functional homologs is likely the pathogenicity determinant of citrus canker pathogen as suggested in a previous study  <cit>  that linked the strains of xanthomonas with different host range together. al-saadi et al.  <cit>  have shown that all the variants carry one ptha homolog with  <dig>  repeats which determines pathogenicity on citrus and triggers immunity in various other plant species  <cit> . the avrbs3/ptha family of effectors includes various pth genes but only ptha  <cit>  is known to induce canker. the functional homolog of this gene in xcca strain  <dig> is ptha <dig>  which also has three other paralogs on its two plasmids . we found two homologs pthaw <dig> and pthaw <dig> in xcaw <dig> genome, both located on plasmid pxcaw <dig>  the pthaw <dig> gene is 99% identical to ptha <dig> from xcca and also to pthaw sequenced from another wellington strain  <dig> that is able to complement a knockout mutant of ptha in xcca strain  <dig>  <cit> , indicating that pthaw <dig> is the functional homolog of ptha in xcaw. pthaw <dig> has the same repeat number  as the functional homologs ptha <dig>  pthb and pthc from the three respective citrus canker causing strains xcca, xaub, and xauc  <cit> . the other homolog pthaw <dig> in xcaw has  <dig>  tandem repeats, which is different from ptha homologs found in xcca that have either  <dig>  or  <dig>  tandem repeats. the avrbs3/ptha family of effectors are known as transcription activator-like  effectors since they reprogram host cells by specifically binding to the promoters of plant genes recognized by the central domain of tandem repeats  <cit> . comparing the dna binding tal effector codes for ptha from xcca as predicted by boch et al.  <cit>  to pthaw indicate that the codes for ptha <dig> and pthaw <dig> are quite divergent . al-saadi et al.  <cit>  predicted that the well conserved sequence of the 17th repeat in functional ptha might be important for pathogenicity on citrus, and this sequence is present in pthaw <dig>  the rest of pthaw <dig> sequence however potentially encodes a dna binding code that is only about 79% similar to the one encoded by ptha <dig> of xcca <dig> . this may result in recognition of different target genes in host plant or differences in strength of induction of plant genes and thus affect virulence of xcaw and xcca.

pathogenicity and growth assays
all three host limited strains of xanthomonas affecting citrus, xcaw, xaub and xauc had avrgf <dig> and xopaf genes in their genomes. the gene avrgf <dig> has been previously studied in xcaw and is known to be responsible for hr in grapefruit  <cit> . however its effect on other varieties of citrus such as sweet orange is unknown. also, since xopaf is the other putative effector gene, its effect on host limitation was further characterized by pathogenicity and growth assays of xcawΔxopaf and xcawΔavrgf1Δxopaf.

pathogenicity assays indicated that xcaw <dig> did not elicit any reaction on valencia or hamlin oranges at our test conditions while wild type xcca <dig> caused necrotic raised lesions, typical of citrus canker on the leaves at a high bacterial inoculation concentration of  <dig> cfu/ml . xcaw <dig> showed a hr on grapefruit leaves that was abolished by deleting avrgf <dig> gene , however the growth of the mutant was visibly reduced compared to xcca <dig> strain. xcawΔavrgf <dig> did not show any symptoms or reaction on either valencia or hamlin .

to check whether mutation of xopaf affects xcaw <dig> growth in planta, the wild-type strains of xcca <dig> and xcaw <dig>  xcawΔxopaf, xcawΔxopaf-53:xopaf , xcawΔavrgf <dig> and xcawΔxopafΔavrgf <dig> mutant strains were inoculated into grapefruit, mexican lime and valencia leaves. as shown in figure 5a, the population of xcaw <dig> was much lower compared to xcca <dig> in grapefruit. this population of xcawΔavrgf <dig> was increased compared to the wild type xcaw <dig> and xcawΔavrgf <dig> caused symptoms on grapefruit. however, the populations of xcawΔxopaf and xcawΔxopafΔavrgf <dig> mutants were one order magnitude lower than that of xcaw <dig> and xcawΔavrgf <dig> respectively, indicating that mutation of xopaf gene decreased the growth of xcaw <dig> in planta. a similar trend was observed in mexican lime where the populations of xopaf single and xopaf, avrgf <dig> double mutants were lower compared to xcaw <dig> and xcawΔavrgf <dig> respectively . the growth of xcawΔxopaf in grapefruit and mexican lime was restored to similar levels as xcaw <dig> by the complementation . no significant changes were observed in valencia leaves as neither xcaw <dig> nor any of its mutants grew well in the sweet orange variety as compared to xcca <dig> .

transcriptome analyses of xcaw <dig> and xcca <dig> under nutrient rich  and hrp gene expression inducing  conditions
to determine the differential gene expression amongst the strains of x. citri subsp. citri, we grew xcaw <dig> and xcca <dig> under nutrient rich condition in nutrient broth  and in xvm <dig>  <cit> . three biological replicates of the strains were used for rna-seq. over  <dig> million reads were obtained on average for each sample. after trimming and mapping, approximately 96% of the reads were mapped to the genomes  indicating that rna-seq provides high quality reads suitable for xanthomonas transcriptomics. of all the reads, over  <dig>  to  <dig> million reads could be mapped from each sample to mrna specifically . this gave an enrichment of mrna from  <dig> % up to  <dig> % for each sample. it has been suggested that 5– <dig> million non-rrna fragments enable profiling of the vast majority of transcriptional activity in diverse species including e. coli grown under diverse culture conditions  <cit> . it was also found that when rna-seq data from biological replicates is available, differential expression of numerous genes can be detected with high statistical significance even when the number of fragments per sample is reduced to 2– <dig> million  <cit> . thus our rna-seq data is likely sufficient for the transcriptome analysis of xcca <dig> and xcaw <dig> 

to quantify the expression of each gene, the reads aligned to each gene were pooled and normalized for gene size by calculating the reads per kb per million reads  values. the values for each gene from all the replicates were further quantile normalized to test them statistically. the resulting values were log <dig> transformed and t-test was performed on these expression values to compare differential gene expression  between xcca <dig> and xcaw <dig> under the same growth conditions or between the same strains in nb or xvm <dig> growth conditions. high correlation was observed between differential expression values of biological replicates , signifying that the method was reproducible. principal component analysis indicates that the biological replicates of xcca formed a separate cluster from xcaw in both growth conditions .

qrt-pcr was used to validate the rna-seq data. eight genes were chosen  that were differentially expressed in xcaw as compared to xcca under both nb and xvm <dig> growth conditions to compare data obtained from the two methods. the resulting transcriptional ratio from qrt-pcr analysis was log <dig> transformed to compare with the dge values obtained by rna-seq . although the scale of fold changes between the two techniques is different, high correlation coefficient of  <dig>  verifies that the general trend of gene expression is consistent for both data sets.

we studied the expression profile of xcc strains in xvm <dig> as compared to nb. at the cut-off of │fold change│ =  <dig>  fdr <  <dig> ,  <dig> genes showed differential expression  in xcca  and  <dig> genes  for xcaw . the entire t3ss cluster consisting of twenty-five genes except one gene  was up-regulated in xvm <dig> for both xcca and xcaw strains . among all the effectors, sixteen were induced for xcca whereas nineteen effectors were overexpressed for xcaw in xvm <dig> compared to in nb. as identified in this study, the effector genes avrbs <dig>  xopa, xope <dig>  xope <dig>  xopi, xopx, xopz <dig>  xopad, xopap, xopaq, hpaa, xopn and xopp were up-regulated in xvm <dig> in both strains, while ptha <dig>  ptha <dig>  avrxace <dig> and xopk were induced only in xcca and xopl, xopr, xopai, xopak, xopaf and xopag only in xcaw strain.

the 11-gene xps cluster encodes for type  <dig> secretion system  in xanthomonas secreting various enzymes including pectate lyase, cellulase, and xylanase. the xps genes were down-regulated in xvm <dig> as compared to in nb for xcaw, with xpse being the most significantly down-regulated. for xcca, the xps genes were not down-regulated. besides the t2ss genes, at least  <dig> genes encoding t2ss substrates in xcca were overexpressed in xvm <dig> as compared to only  <dig> in xcaw. to the contrary  <dig> genes for xcaw and  <dig> for xcca were down-regulated in xvm <dig> compared to in nb .

our analysis showed that all the flagella biosynthesis genes encoded by flg and fli, motility by mot and chemotaxis by mcp, che and tsr were repressed in xvm <dig> for xcca and xcaw except chey  and tar . the genes encoding lps were down-regulated in both xcaw and xcca, whereas the xanthan gum  genes were overexpressed in both except gump in xcca. a few genes encoding outer membrane proteins, which are involved in adhesion, including ompw, blc and hms were up-regulated in xvm <dig> as compared to in nb for both strains while xada and yaph were induced in xcca but down-regulated in xcaw. the type iv pili genes encoded by pil and fim genes except pilb and filamentous haemagglutinin related genes  were down-regulated in both xcaw and xcca .

in order to further understand the molecular mechanisms determining the differences in virulence and host range of xcaw and xcca, we compared the expression profile of common genes of xcaw and xcca. when expression of orthologous genes in xcaw was compared to xcca,  <dig> genes  in nb  and  <dig> genes  genes in xvm <dig>  conditions were significantly differentially regulated at cut-off value of │fold change│ =  <dig> and fdr <  <dig> . on comparing the differentially expressed genes in both conditions,  <dig> genes were differentially regulated in xcaw as compared to xcca, irrespective of the growth conditions . of these  <dig> were overexpressed in xcaw and  <dig> genes were repressed as compared to xcca . of the  <dig> genes overexpressed in xcaw,  <dig> were virulence-related genes including hrpx, hrpg, phop-phoq regulatory genes, and t2ss substrate genes  . of the  <dig> genes overexpressed in xcca,  <dig> were virulence-related genes including cellulase genes , reactive oxygen species scavenging enzyme genes, e.g., superoxide dismutase gene sodc <dig>  and genes encoding heat shock protein grpe and heat stress protein muc.

since the gene expression of t2ss substrate genes was different, we compared the protease and pectate lyase activities of xcca <dig> and xcaw <dig>  xcaw <dig> showed higher protease activity than xcca <dig> . xcaw <dig> showed lower pectate lyase activity compared to xcca <dig> .

discussion
comparative analysis of xcaw <dig> and xcca <dig> identified multiple strain-specific genes that might contribute to the differences in virulence and host range. among the genes present in xcaw <dig>  but absent in xcca <dig>  two effector genes xopag  and xopaf were identified in xcaw, xaub and xauc but were not present in xcca <dig> genome . the presence of these effectors in limited host range strains causing citrus canker and not in the broader host range xcca <dig> makes them prime candidates for effectors that could affect host specificity. importantly, the role of xopag  in limiting the host range of xcaw has been confirmed previously  <cit> . the xopag gene belongs to the avrgf <dig> family and has been shown to trigger hr in grapefruit  <cit> . avrgf <dig> in xcaw shows only about 45% identity to its homolog xauc_ <dig> in xauc whereas the homolog xaub_ <dig> in xaub is interrupted by a transposon and might be non-functional, which probably contributes to the broader host range of xaub compared to xcaw and xauc  <cit> . when the mutant xcawΔxopag was inoculated in grapefruit it caused typical canker like symptoms instead of hr, but the symptoms were visibly reduced  <cit> . also, xcawΔavrgf <dig> does not cause disease on sweet orange  as shown in figure  <dig>  indicating that there are other host limiting factors in the xcaw <dig> genome or other virulence factors are required for xcca <dig> to infect different hosts. another candidate gene, which might contribute to host specificity, is xopaf, which belongs to avrxv <dig> family and is located on the plasmid pxcaw <dig> in xcaw <dig>  homologs of xopaf, xaub_ <dig> and xauc_ <dig> are found in xaub and xauc but not in xcca <dig> . thus, we initially hypothesized that xopaf may contribute to restricting host range of xcaw <dig>  xaub, and xauc to limited varieties of citrus as compared to xcca <dig>  additionally, an xopaf homolog avrxv <dig> from x. campestris pv. vesicatoria is known to induce hr in tomato line hawaii  <dig> and pepper plants  <cit> . the same work also ascertained that the gene was plant inducible and regulated by the hrp regulatory system. the c terminal region of the protein encodes for a putative transcription activator domain indicating that it might interact with plant host genes. in this study we found that xopaf mutant and xopaf avrgf <dig> double mutant both have lower growth in planta as compared to xcaw <dig> and avrgf <dig> single mutant respectively . mutation of xopaf did not make xcaw <dig> strain pathogenic in sweet orange valencia. instead, mutation of xopaf slowed the growth of the pathogen in grapefruit and mexican lime, which was restored by complementation, indicating that xopaf is important for bacterial growth in planta. in addition to the effectors documented above, other effectors that differ in their presence are xopaq, xope <dig>  xopn, xopp and xopae, present in xcaw <dig>  xcca <dig> and xaub but not in xauc strain. also xopb, xope <dig> and xopj <dig> are present in both xaub and xauc but missing from xcca <dig> and xcaw <dig>  how these effectors contribute to virulence and host range of xcca, xcaw, xaub, and xauc requires further investigation.

other gene content differences between xcaw <dig> and xcca <dig> include differences in lps cluster , phage related genes with xcaw containing xcaw_ <dig> to xcaw_ <dig>  xacw_ <dig> to xcaw_ <dig> whereas xcca exclusively includes xac <dig>  xac <dig>  and type iv secretion system and a plant-like natriuretic peptide  encoding gene . interestingly, all the genes in lps cluster from xcaw <dig> show high similarity with lps region from rice pathogen x. oryzae pv. oryzicola bls <dig>  whereas only approximately half the cluster is syntenic to xcca <dig> lps cluster . this suggests that hgt has probably resulted in a hybrid lps cluster in xcaw <dig> similar to x. oryzae pv. oryzicola bls <dig>  <cit> . lps, phage related proteins, type iv secretion system and pnp have been reported to play certain roles in virulence  <cit> . how they contribute to the difference of xcaw and xcca in virulence and host range remains to be investigated experimentally.

virulence related genes were differentially regulated in xvm <dig> as compared to nb for both xcaw <dig> and xcca <dig>  in xcca <dig> , fifty-nine virulence related genes were induced and thirty-eight genes were repressed in xvm <dig> compared to nb. in xcaw <dig> , forty virulence related genes were induced and twenty-four genes were repressed in xvm <dig> compared to nb. the induction of the virulence genes in xvm <dig> condition compared to nutrient rich nb is supported by a previous study  <cit> . in the previous study, only  <dig> genes of xcca potentially associated with pathogenicity and virulence were tested and  <dig> genes were up-regulated in xvm <dig>  while only  <dig> genes were repressed. in our study, we further expanded the previous study by including all genes of xcca and provided a comprehensive picture of xanthomonas gene regulation.

the entire t3ss cluster consisting of twenty-five genes except one  was up-regulated in xvm <dig> for both xcca and xcaw strains. this is consistent with previous report that xanthomonas hrp genes were induced in xvm <dig>  <cit> . however, only eight hrp genes of xcca were reported to be up-regulated by xvm <dig> in the previous study  <cit>  compared to  <dig> induced hrp genes identified in this study. among all the effectors,  <dig> were induced for xcca whereas  <dig> effectors were overexpressed for xcaw in xvm <dig>  in the previous study  <cit> , only three effector genes avrxace <dig>  avrxace <dig>  and xac <dig> of xcca were induced in xvm <dig>  thus, our study further expanded the knowledge of expression of the hrp and effector genes in xvm <dig> medium.

interestingly, both hrpx and hrpg genes were overexpressed in the xcaw compared to xcca . both genes have been shown to be critical for virulence in xanthomonas spp.  <cit> . the hrpx gene encodes an arac-type transcriptional activator and hrpg gene encodes an ompr family regulator, which are known to regulate many virulence related genes including t3ss effectors, t2ss substrate, flagella, and chemotaxis genes  <cit> . overexpression of xcaw hrpg in x. perforans elicited hr in grapefruit and mexican lime leaves probably by inducing xopa and other avirulence genes  <cit> . the xopa gene encodes harpin and was suggested to be a host-limiting factor by inducing hr. its homologues hpag and hrpn are also known to induce hr. however, the xopa gene was not overexpressed significantly in xcaw compared to xcca . the fold change of xopa was more than  <dig>  but the fdr did not pass the cut off value. five other effector genes xopl, xopx, xopad, hrpw, and xopaq were overexpressed in xcaw in xvm <dig>  whereas only one effector gene xopap was induced in xcca in nb . overexpression of those effector genes in xcaw might contribute to the limited host range of xcaw. in addition, the phop-phoq two component system genes were overexpressed in xcaw compared to xcca . the phop gene encoding a response regulator is predicted to interact with various signal sensor proteins in addition to phoq. it is known to activate the response regulator hrpg in x. oryzae pv. oryzae, thus leading to activation of various virulence and growth factor genes downstream  <cit> . the phoq gene on the other hand is required for the activity of avrxa <dig> in x. oryzae pv. oryzae, which determines host-variation of the strain against some rice lines  <cit> . thus in xcaw, overexpression of phop-phoq could contribute to activation of certain effector genes mentioned above.

t2ss is the major protein secretion system, which secretes toxins and various degradative enzymes to breakdown the cell wall in plant hosts  <cit> . t2ss and its substrates have been shown to be important for the virulence of xcca  <cit> . the xps genes were down-regulated in xvm <dig> as compared to in nb for xcaw with xpse being the most significantly down-regulated . xpse is known to be a key component of t2ss, the loss of which leads to lower virulence in x. oryzae <cit> . for xcca, the xps genes were not down-regulated. down-regulation of xps genes in xcaw but not in xcca might contribute to differences in virulence on different hosts of xcaw and xcca. in xcca at least  <dig> genes encoding t2ss substrates were overexpressed as compared to only  <dig> in xcaw. on the contrary  <dig> genes for xcaw and  <dig> for xcca were down-regulated. this is similar to the previous study where genes encoding t2ss substrates were found either down-regulated or up-regulated in xvm <dig>  <cit> . specifically, four t2ss substrate protease genes  were up-regulated in xcaw compared to xcca in both conditions . consequently, xcaw showed higher protease activity than xcca . in contrast, multiple cellulase genes  were down-regulated in xcaw compared to xcca . pectate lyase gene pel  was also down-regulated in xcaw compared to xcca in nb medium . consequently, xcaw showed lower pectate lyase activity as compared to xcca . thus, the protease and pectate lyase activities are consistent with the differential regulation of genes encoding t2ss substrates in xcaw and xcca.

compared to xcaw, multiple virulence genes were overexpressed in xcca which might contribute to its adaption to a broad host range . these include many reactive oxygen species-scavenging enzyme genes, e.g., sodc <dig> and grpe, which indicates that xcca might be more adapted to stressful conditions due to the host defense responses of different hosts. attachment of xanthomonas to plant cell surfaces is important for pathogenicity  <cit> . multiple genes involved in adherence were overexpressed in xcca in nb medium  including filamentous haemagglutinin gene fhab, gum genes , chemotaxis genes , mcp genes , chea , cher , cher , chey  and ched . multiple transporter genes, which are known to play critical roles in bacteria to acquire nutrients from the intercellular environment, were overexpressed in xcca in xvm <dig> as compared to xcaw, e.g., the potassium transporter genes kdpb, kdpc and kdpd and the iron siderophore transporter gene fhua  and xac <dig> . altogether, they might contribute to the virulence on broad host of xcca as compared to xcaw.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, comparative genomic analysis of xcaw <dig>  xaub, xauc, and xcca <dig> provides insights into the virulence mechanism of x. citri subsp. citri. our study indicated that avrgf <dig> mainly contributes to the host range limitation of xcaw <dig> whereas xopaf contributes to virulence. in addition, we compared the gene expression profiles of xcca <dig> and xcaw <dig> in nb and xvm <dig>  our data demonstrated that virulence genes including genes encoding t3ss and its effectors are induced in xvm <dig> medium. numerous genes with differential expression in xcaw <dig> and xcca <dig> were identified. this study lays the foundation to further characterize the mechanisms for virulence and host range of strains of x. citri subsp. citri and other bacterial pathogens.
