BACKGROUND
botrytis cinerea is a haploid necrotrophic ascomycete which is known as a major pathogen responsible for 'grey mold' disease in more than  <dig> plant species  <cit> . it attacks aboveground plant organs, and is a major pathogen during post-harvest storage due to its exceptional ability to grow, develop and attack produce at low temperatures. the high impact of diseases caused by b. cinerea has triggered a wide scope of molecular research in recent years, resulting in the sequencing of two b. cinerea strains. this has generated a wealth of information on the genome of this fungus  <cit> . along with genomic research, the development of additional tools, such as transcriptome, proteome and secretome analysis, has yielded additional information on the mechanisms underlying b. cinerea pathogenicity. these methods have filled in some of the gaps in our knowledge but unlike model organisms such as neurospora crassa  <cit> , functional analysis remains a significant bottleneck. the first requirement for functional analysis is a robust and high-throughput transformation protocol. however, the existing protoplast-based and agrobacterium-mediated transformation methods  <cit>  are complex and time-consuming; moreover, protoplast preparation is tedious and requires an enzyme cocktail whose consistency between batches is unknown. here we describe two alternative protocols--direct hyphal transformation by blasting  <cit>  and wounding-mediated transformation of sclerotia--both fast, simple and reproducible methods which might improve functional analysis in b. cinerea and other sclerotium-forming fungi.

methods
fungal cultures and growth conditions
b. cinerea isolate bo <dig>  was maintained on potato dextrose agar  amended with  <dig> mg/l chloramphenicol  at 22-25°c for  <dig> to  <dig> days on 90-mm diameter petri dishes. conidia were harvested with purified water  containing  <dig> %  triton x- <dig> . the number of conidia was counted under a light microscope, at 400× magnification. selection media consisted of gamborg b <dig> ph  <dig>  containing  <dig>  g/l gamborg b <dig> powder with vitamins ,  <dig>  g/l of sodium nitrate  and 3%  glucose amended with 50- <dig> μg/ml hygromycin b   and  <dig> g/l agar or pda plates, ph  <dig> , amended with  <dig> μg/ml phleomycin .

preparation of the dna constructs
the bacterio-rhodopsin   knockout construct  was based on a modified gateway vector  <cit> . the regions which flank the br gene  are present on both sides of the hygr cassette. the upstream 420-bp fragment  was amplified using primers: br5'f agatggggcggctgggta and br5'r agatc-ccactatcctatca. the downstream 418-bp flanking region  was amplified using the primers br3'f tagtcgcgaacgatgtgaag and br3'r gaacacatcgtccgtttcct. the middle region of the hygromycin resistance cassette   was amplified using the primers brhf gggg-acaactttgtatagaaaagttggcggccgccacaaagacctctcgccttt and brhr ggggacaactttgtataataaagttggcggccgcccgactcccaactcg-actac. fragments were joined together by pcr in three stages as previously described  <cit> .

the pbc-brphleo construct  was generated by cloning the br gene  using primers: brbf: agcctcgtcctgtacaactataggatcccatccca-caacataactct and brer: ttaactgtactcctatcctatacttaagatacttttcggttagagcggatg into the pdes-phleo vector  <cit>  between the ecori  and bamhi  restriction sites.

the third construct, knocked out in hypothetial protein  <dig>  , was generated by fusion of three pcr fragments   <cit> . the upstream fragment of hp <dig>  was amplified by the primers: hp5'f agtgttcaacgagctcca; hp5'r aggtgagtgttgcggctagt and the downstream flanking region  was amplified using primers: hp3'f ggataaagaacagctaatct and hp3'r actagccgcaacactcacct. the hygr cassette  was amplified from pct <dig>  <cit>  using primers hhf: aggtgagtgttgcggctagtgcactgctctgctgtctctgaagctggtcc g, and hhr: atcagttaacgtggataaagaaca. after sequencing, the pcr fragments were joined to the hygr fragment by pcr with the nested primers  as described previously  <cit> .

protoplast preparation
protoplasts were prepared as previously described by noda and colleagues  <cit>  with some modifications. conidia from a well-sporulated plate were harvested and used to inoculate  <dig> ml of liquid malt medium containing :  <dig> g glucose,  <dig> g malt extract ,  <dig> g casein peptone ,  <dig> g yeast extract ,  <dig> g casamino acids . the culture was shaken overnight at  <dig> rpm at  <dig> to 22°c. the developing mycelium was collected on a nytex membrane and the membrane was washed with  <dig> ml sterile water followed by two washes with  <dig>  m cold kcl buffer  containing  <dig> mm cacl <dig> . the washed mycelium  was transferred into a 50-ml erlenmeyer flask with  <dig> ml filter-sterilized protoplast solution containing  <dig>  mg/ml lysing enzymes  suspended in kcl buffer. the suspension was shaken for  <dig> to  <dig> h at  <dig> rpm and 28°c and generation of protoplasts was monitored by light microscope. the protoplasts were generated from germinating conidia, broken hyphae or both sources together and were separated from the original tissue over a 60-mesh nytex membrane . protoplasts were further purified by two centrifugations  and the pellet was washed by gentle resuspension in  <dig> ml kcl buffer, centrifuged, resuspended in the residual buffer and transferred into a new pre-cooled tube. the number of protoplasts was adjusted to  <dig> cells/ml.

electroporation
the electroporation protocol was adapted from  <cit> , with some modifications, and used on either protoplasts or germinated conidia. protoplasts were prepared as described above and washed with cold electroporation buffer containing  <dig> mm n-2-hydroxyethlpiperazine-n'-2-ethanesulfonic acid ,  <dig> mm mannitol , ph  <dig> . conidia were incubated in malt medium for  <dig> h at 25°c, centrifuged  and then washed with cold electroporation buffer and their concentration was adjusted to  <dig> conidia/ml. aliquots of protoplasts or germinated conidia  were dispensed in cold electroporation cuvettes  and  <dig>  to  <dig> μg dna was added. the electroporation was performed with a 'gene pulser'  operated at  <dig>  kv,  <dig> w and  <dig> μf. after application of the electrical pulse, the conidia or protoplasts were transferred to regeneration medium containing :  <dig>  g mannitol ,  <dig> g yeast extract,  <dig> g soluble starch and  <dig> g agar . after  <dig> h, an overlay of  <dig> ml hm medium consisting of: 1%  malt extract, 4% glucose,  <dig> %  yeast extract,  <dig> mg na2hpo <dig>   <dig> mg nh4c <dig>   <dig> mg mgso <dig> 7h <dig>   <dig> mg cac <dig> 2h2o,  <dig> mg fec <dig> 6h2o,  <dig> mg na2so <dig>   <dig> mg mes,  <dig> mg hepes and  <dig> % agar, ph  <dig>  with  <dig> μg/ml of hygromycin b , was poured onto the plates. colonies appeared after  <dig> to  <dig> days and were transferred to gamborg b <dig> solid medium with  <dig> μg/ml hyg or pda medium supplemented with  <dig> μg/ml phleo.

transformation of sclerotia
for sclerotium transformation, b. cinerea or sclerotinia sclerotiorum sclerotia were collected from mature colonies grown on pda plates for  <dig> days or more at 22°c or 18°c, respectively. sclerotia were disinfected by three washes with 1% sodium hypochlorite, followed by three washes with sterilized purified water. the sclerotia were dried between washes on sterile whatman filter paper in a biological hood and were completely dried prior to transformation. the dried sclerotia were wounded by generating a hole in the middle of the sclerotia  with a sterile needle  followed by four applications at 30-s intervals of  <dig> μl dna solution  or sterile purified water, both supplemented with  <dig> %  silwet l- <dig> surfactant . after  <dig> to  <dig> min, the solution was fully absorbed and sclerotia were placed on water-agar plates which were then incubated for  <dig> to  <dig> days at 22°c. at this stage, sclerotia were transferred to solid selective media. when vacuum was added to this procedure, the sclerotia were transferred, after wounding, into a  <dig> -ml polypropylene tube and covered with dna solution  or water as a control, both supplemented with  <dig> % silwet l- <dig> surfactant. the tubes were placed in a speedvac  and vacuum was applied for  <dig> min. the growing hyphae were then transferred onto new plates containing gamborg b <dig> solid medium and  <dig> μg/ml hyg. viable colonies were transferred to new plates  with increasing concentrations of hyg, up to  <dig> μg/ml in steps of  <dig> μg/ml, or pda medium supplemented with  <dig> μg/ml phleo that was increased to  <dig> μg/ml in  <dig> μg/ml steps.

transformation by hyphal blasting
the hyphal-blasting procedure was adopted from levy and colleagues  <cit>  with some modifications. pda plates were inoculated in the center with  <dig> μl of spore suspension  and then incubated at 22°c for  <dig> to  <dig> h until the colony diameter was in the range of  <dig> to  <dig>  cm. before use, blast cassettes were cleaned by immersion in soap and water, followed by five washes with sterile purified water, disinfection with 70% ethanol and drying in a biological cabin. for the blasting procedure, a 'bim-lab' instrument  was used. the instrument was adjusted to the manual setting at a pressure of  <dig> bars, and the 'gun' was set at a height of  <dig> cm above the petri dish. cassettes were loaded with  <dig>  to  <dig> μg of the dna solution or sterile purified water diluted with  <dig> % silwet l- <dig> surfactant. the cassette containing the dna was connected to the gun and the dna was blasted over the edge of the colony mycelium four to five times at 10-s intervals until drops were fully dispersed over the plate. plates were then incubated for  <dig> to  <dig> h and  <dig> plugs from the perimeter of the colony were transferred to gamborg b <dig> solid medium plates supplemented with  <dig> μg/ml hyg.

analysis of transformants
the stability of the strains in all of the above methods was verified by five transfers of the colony edges onto new solid gamborg b <dig> medium with increasing concentrations of hyg  or pda medium supplemented with  <dig> μg/ml phleo that was increased up to  <dig> μg/ml in  <dig> μg/ml steps and then five subsequent transfers onto pda plates without the selection.

for dna extraction, b. cinerea mycelium was grown in  <dig> ml gamborg b <dig> liquid medium for  <dig> days and harvested by filtration over three layers of sterile  <dig> mm paper discs. freshly harvested  or lyophilized  mycelia were added to 2-ml tubes with a volume of glass beads  equivalent to 100- <dig> μl,  <dig> μl breaking buffer  and  <dig> μl chloroform:isoamyl alcohol . tubes were sealed and vortexed for  <dig> to  <dig> min, at a speed of 7- <dig> in a genie  <dig> vortex  and then centrifuged for  <dig> min at maximum speed . the supernatant  was amended with  <dig> μl of  <dig> m sodium acetate ph  <dig>  and  <dig> ml of 96% ethanol. tubes were then incubated for  <dig> min at -20°c and dna was precipitated by centrifugation . the dna was washed with 70% ethanol and centrifuged for  <dig> min at  <dig> g. the pellet was dried for  <dig> h in a biological hood and suspended in  <dig> μl te  or sterile ultra-purified water. dna extraction from s. sclerotiorum was performed by fast extraction from mycelial plugs using naoh as described by levy and colleagues  <cit> .

to verify transformation, we performed pcr analyses on dna extracted from putative transformants using hygr  and phleor  cassette primers . for verification of knockout by homologous recombination, a 480-bp fragment was amplified with primer br-gen 5'f, which is located in the 5' upstream genomic region of the br gene and is not present in the 5' fragment of the br construct, and primer br-hyg 5'r from the hyg cassette; a 590-bp fragment was amplified by primer br-gen 3'f which is located in the 3' downstream genomic region of the br gene and is not present in the 3' fragment of the br construct, and primer br-hyg 3'r which is located at the 3' end of the hyg cassette.

all pcr analyses were performed in  <dig> -ml tubes containing pcr reagent  with  <dig> pmol of primers,  <dig>  to  <dig> ng template dna and sterile purified water to a final volume of  <dig> μl. pcr was carried out on a t-gradient pcr instrument . activation of the enzyme was carried out at 95°c for  <dig> min followed by denaturation for  <dig> s at 94°c, annealing at 62°c for  <dig> s, elongation at 70°c for  <dig> s for  <dig> to  <dig> cycles, and  <dig> min of elongation at 70°c. pcr products were analyzed on a  <dig> to 2% agarose gel according to their size and stained with 'safeview' .

RESULTS
protoplast-mediated transformation by electroporation
three different dna constructs were used for transformation of b. cinerea . the br knockout construct  was based on a modified gateway vector according to shafran and colleagues  <cit>  . this construct was used with all transformation methods. protoplasts generated from germinating conidia or broken hyphae were used for electroporation experiments: the few colonies that slowly recovered from electroporation did not survive the hyg selection.

sclerotium-mediated transformation
both b. cinerea and s. sclerotiorum are known to produce sclerotia--melanized and condensed hyphal structures which are able to survive harsh environmental conditions in nature. sclerotia can be readily collected from mature  cultures and preserved dry under ambient conditions. the possibility of transforming sclerotia is therefore very appealing. sclerotia were collected from mature culture , disinfected, wounded with a needle, and dna supplemented with surfactant silwet l- <dig> was introduced by pipetting directly onto the wound. silwet l- <dig> was chosen because it reduces surface tension more than most surfactants and has been found to greatly enhance bacterial entry into relatively inaccessible plant tissues in plant transformation  <cit> . in an experiment with the br knockout construct,  <dig> sclerotia yielded  <dig>  hyg-resistant and pcr-positive transformants , and  <dig>  of these strains were identified as knockout strains by pcr of the hyg cassette with the flanking region of br genomic dna . these results demonstrated the feasibility of sclerotium-mediated transformation.

to further verify the reproducibility of this method, we introduced the pbc-brphleo complementation cassette, which contains the br gene and the phleo selection marker  on pbc-phleo  <cit> , into the b. cinerea br knockout strain . the vector was introduced into sclerotia in its native circular structure. the experiment included  <dig> sclerotia resulting in recovery of  <dig> phleo-resistant and pcr-positive isolates  . a third construct for knockout of hp <dig> was generated by fusion pcr  <cit>   . it was introduced into  <dig> sclerotia, resulting in three transformants  .

to test whether sclerotium-mediated transformation can be extended to other sclerotium-producing fungi, a linear plasmid containing a hygr cassette  <cit>  was introduced into sclerotia of s. sclerotiorum, resulting in  <dig> to 10% transformation efficiency as verified by pcr analysis  and application of vacuum resulted in a higher number of transformants . other knockout constructs were also successfully introduced into s. sclerotiorum with high efficiency . these results suggest that transformation of sclerotia is a viable approach, while it remains to be determined if the efficiency of transformation is construct-dependent  <cit> .

direct hyphal transformation
another transformation approach which was extensively tested was direct hyphal transformation using a high-pressure air pulse obtained from a 'bim-lab' instrument to bombard and transform mycelia  <cit> . unlike conventional bombardment, this method employs a dna solution that contains a surfactant rather than solid particles such as tungsten or gold. the mixture of dna construct and surfactant is blasted over the periphery of the growing colony onto the hyphal tips during the early stages of growth. blasting conidia or germinating conidia with the br knockout construct did not yield any transformants. however, when blasting was performed on a young colony , we obtained 66% putative transformants, while older colonies  produced only 25% putative transformants. in terms of efficiency, five experiments with the br knockout construct resulted in  <dig> colonies yielding 39% transformants , and  <dig>  of them were identified as knockout strains by pcr of the hyg cassette with the flanking region of br genomic dna . therefore, we used young colonies for further experiments with the pbc-brphleo vector and hp <dig> construct. transformation with pbc-brphleo resulted in  <dig> phleo-resistant colonies, 34% of which were pcr-positive strains , while transformation with the hp <dig> construct yielded an average of  <dig> transformants from  <dig> colonies  .

discussion
since protoplast-based and agrobacterium-mediated transformation methods are complex and time-consuming, we set out to develop new and simple transformation methods for b. cinerea. we tested different transformation methods, two of which were based on published transformation protocols  and one which is a newly developed method and is based on wounding-mediated transformation of sclerotia.

electroporation did not yield any results despite repeated attempts under various conditions. in addition, there is no published protocol for b. cinerea and other labs that have tried this method have not reported positive results. of the other two methods described, transformation of sclerotia was efficient , easy to perform, required no dedicated instruments or reagents, and colonies appeared after a relatively short time. a significant advantage of this method is the possibility of storing sclerotia for long periods but obviously, it can only be used on strains and species which form sclerotia. the second method, bombardment of dna with high-pressure air blasted directly onto the growing hyphal tips, also demonstrated good efficiency  and took only a short time, as has also been shown for s. sclerotiorum  <cit> . unlike conventional bombardment, this method employs a dna solution that contains a surfactant, which may assist in dna penetration into the cells  <cit> , rather than solid particles such as tungsten or gold  <cit> . however, it should be noted that this method requires a specialized instrument. both methods required small amounts of dna construct, which can be a significant advantage in terms of cost and throughput, and both methods demonstrated facilitated, high efficiency gene targeting .

one possible explanation for the positive results with the sclerotium and blast methods is the fact that they impose minimal stress on the cells. in contrast, the electroporation method requires diversion of metabolism to cell-wall regeneration and membrane recovery, and both of these processes may result in a significant stress response. we believe that these reproducible and reliable transformation procedures will increase the efficiency of transformation, will simplify and improve our ability to resolve gene function in this important phytopathogen, and can be easily calibrated for additional fungi.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we describe two alternative protocols--direct hyphal transformation by blasting and wounding-mediated transformation of sclerotia, which are fast, simple and reproducible and might improve functional analysis in b. cinerea and other sclerotium-forming fungi. future studies will show if these transformation methods have wide applicability for improved gene-targeting efficiency and if they can replace current methodologies.
