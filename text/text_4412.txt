BACKGROUND
after the study of genome evolution, much effort has been recently put on the evolution of gene regulation and gene expression . several recent studies report the existence of differentially expressed genes across species. these differences in gene expression could be due to various evolutionary processes, neutral or not . all these studies focused on comparisons between species, with large evolutionary divergences.

for shorter evolutionary times, hufford et al.  <cit>  observed that candidate genes for domestication in maize do not display any specific expression profile, contrary to the genomic patterns . for the domesticated period of sorghum, jiang et al.  <cit>  observed that gene expression divergence between two lines was mainly determined by dna sequence divergence. nätt et al.  <cit>  on the contrary observed numerous gene expression and methylation changes between wild and domesticated chickens, with an overrepresentation in selective sweeps. for a shorter time scale, yang et al.  <cit>  used gene expression in addition to genomic polymorphism  to assign a human individual to its ethnic population. muller et al.  <cit>  suggest that gene expression changes could be related to the out-of-africa adaptation in drosophila with a clear sex-specificity. in budding yeast, fraser et al.  <cit>  observed that entire pathways can be affected by adaptation of gene expression. transcriptomic differences, as well as proteomics and metabolomics were shown between two genetically diverse dry bean germplasm by mensack et al.  <cit> .

as briefly shown above, some work has been conducted on the differences in gene expression across populations, these populations being mostly at species level. the following question is however less studied. are there any differentially expressed genes across breeds of the same species? if yes, what are their biological functions? we propose to explore this problem in the particular context of a domesticated species with a long history of selection pressure from human: the pig. perez-enciso et al.  <cit>  compared gene expression among pig breeds in several tissues and provided interesting results on gene expression divergence. however, only  <dig> animals were used in their study. the aim of our study was to see if genes were differentially expressed among the main western pig breeds, at a larger sampling scale, and what might be the biological implications. secondly, we aim to answer the questions what kind of gene expression characterizes a particular breed, and what differentiates a breed on the basis of gene expression. for that purpose, we will focus on one tissue of interest in pig breeding: a post-mortem muscle. indeed pig meat production has placed a strong selective pressure on various characteristics of meat .

RESULTS
data
the sampled animals came from  <dig> pig breeds:  <dig> duroc ,  <dig> landrace ,  <dig> large white dam line ,  <dig> large white sire line  and  <dig> piétrain . the two large white lines derived from a common and recent ancestor, and were specialized on “male” traits  for lwm or on “female” traits  for lwf. all animals were males  except piétrain . they were reared in  <dig> different contemporary groups, and slaughtered around 100 kg as in  <cit> . from these animals,  <dig> post-mortem longissimus dorsi muscle samples were analyzed using the porcine agilent 44 k v <dig> microarray. a total of  <dig>  probes were detected and considered as expressed in muscle in the conditions of this experiment and after normalization. from these  <dig>  probes,  <dig>   were mapped on the porcine genome  of which  <dig>   were localized on the autosomes.

global differential analysis
the aim was to identify genes whose expression varied across breeds. a large number of probes were found differentially expressed . a list of  <dig>  de probes was identified between the five breeds for a fdr of 5 % .table  <dig> number of differentially expressed probes linked to the breed effect

two statistical analyses were applied to the data: a fisher test to identify genes whose expression, differ among the  <dig> breeds  and a pairwise comparison to identify which genes are differentially expressed between pairs of breeds. the table gives the number of differentially expressed probes for the analysis of all transcripts and for the analysis restricted to the transcripts localized on the genomic sequence of the autosomes



a principal component analysis  was performed on the  <dig>  de probes at  <dig>  % fdr, or equivalently a multidimensional scaling on euclidian distance between individuals. the first axis  clearly separated piétrain animals from the others with 19 % of the variability explained. keeping in mind the confounding effect of sex and piétrain, this result suggests that the sex effect was the most important effect on the variation of gene expression in post-mortem muscle of the main western pig breeds. although pc <dig> was difficult to interpret , pc <dig> separated duroc from large white animals , with landrace and piétrain animals in between . pc <dig> and pc <dig> were able to separate landrace from piétrain animals .fig.  <dig> principal component analysis of the top differentially expressed genes across breeds. top  <dig>  differentially expressed spots for a fdr equal to  <dig>  % were used  and top  <dig>  differentially expressed spots for a fdr  <dig>  % restricted to genes localized on autosomes ;  principal component   <dig> vs pc  <dig>   pc  <dig> vs pc  <dig>  piétrain  animals are displayed in green, landrace  in blue, duroc  in brown, large white sire line  in red and dam line  in pink



in the differential expression analysis, tests of significance between pairs of breeds  allow the identification of  <dig>  de probes at a fdr of  <dig>  %. a summary is given in table  <dig>  although, most of these  <dig>  de probes were part of the  <dig>  de probes identified above by the global differential analysis,  <dig> de probes were solely identified by the pairwise analysis . a list of  <dig>  de probes, the union of global or pairwise analyses, was available for further functional analysis. the detailed statistical results for the  <dig>  de probes are listed in additional file  <dig> with details of genes’ annotation on additional file  <dig>  as already seen on the pca plots , piétrain was the most different from the other breeds. only six probes with a fdr 5 % appeared significant in the comparison of large white lines, due to the small sample size in large white sire line and the high genetic proximity of these lines . venn diagrams for the other comparisons with a fdr of  <dig>  % are plotted on fig.  <dig> table  <dig> number of differentially expressed probes between two breeds from the pairwise analysis

the number of differentially expressed probes between two breeds is given  for the analysis of all transcripts or the transcripts localized on the autosomes. breed codes are du for duroc, lr for landrace, lwf for large white dam line, lwm for large white sire line, and pi for piétrain

eight probes were detected as differentially expressed between landrace and every other breed. among them, seven probes corresponded to igf <dig> which is  <dig>  fold decreased in landrace compared to the other breeds .fig.  <dig> examples of gene expression across the five breeds. the boxplots are given to illustrate the expression profiles of igf <dig>  kit, oca <dig>  tjp <dig>  pik3c <dig>  pik3cg, rab <dig>  usp9x and usp9y genes. the y-axis represents the expression level . breeds are displayed as follows, piétrain  animals are displayed in green, landrace  in blue, duroc  in brown, large white sire line  in red and dam line  in pink



the overall intersect for comparisons with duroc included the v-kit hardy-zuckerman  <dig> feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog   <cit>  and oculocutaneous albinism ii  genes . kit and oca <dig> genes are both mainly known to be involved in the determination of skin colour  <cit> . as expected, both genes are under-expressed in duroc compared to the other pigs, white pigs or white spotted pigs . this under-expression was observed in muscle tissue where kit and oca <dig> encode membrane transporters and kit is involved in the activation of the pi3k pathway.

twenty-two genes were differentially expressed between the large white dam line and the other breeds excluding the large white sire line. the most differentially expressed gene is rab <dig>  a gene coding a small g proteins belonging to the ras superfamily. this superfamily is known to coordinate vesicular trafficking in the cell  <cit> . mutations in rab <dig> have been detected in humans with progressive neurological deterioration, and a severe hypotonia. moreover, the variance of rab <dig> expression in skeletal muscle may suggest that this gene is especially genetically regulated in large white dam line .

among the  <dig> genes differentially expressed between piétrain and all the other breeds,  <dig> are localized on chromosomes x or y. two examples of gene expression are presented on fig.  <dig> with the genes usp9x and usp9y, respectively up and down regulated in piétrain. this result corresponds to an over-representation of expression in females compared to males while a more widely held view is dosage compensation between xx and xy gene expression. in this work, as expected the usp <dig> gene localized on y chromosome was not expressed in female; while the expression of the usp <dig> gene localized on x chromosome was overexpressed in piétrain compared to its expression in the other breeds. here where only piétrains are female, we observed a doubled expression of the usp9x and no expression of usp9y. the result would be an almost equal expression of usp <dig> proteins with probably similar function .

differential analysis restricted to the genes localized on autosomes
according to our preceding results and the description of how chromosome x is subject to selective pressure with more highly sex-biased gene expression  <cit> , another differential analysis was conducted on the restricted list of  <dig>  genes located on autosomes in order to lessen the sex effect observed with the first analysis. in these conditions,  <dig>  de probes were identified globally across breeds  and  <dig>  de probes for the pairwise comparisons . the union of both lists led to a total of  <dig>  de probes with a fdr for the global analysis of less than  <dig>  %. these analyses  were done in parallel. that would allow the identification of the molecular basis of the difference between breeds including the piétrain. however some genes  were not localized because they are absent from the current assembly, even if their locations are well known . figure  <dig>  shows how avoiding x localized genes placed piétrain pigs closer to the other breeds without changing the overall projection of the different breeds. the number of de probes can be found in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  see additional file  <dig> for details about probes on autosomes. no localized de probes were identified between large white sire and dam lines even with a fdr of 5 %.

restricting the analysis to the autosomes is likely to be only a partial solution to the confounding effect of gender and breed. we chose to maintain piétrain in the analysis because this breed is of prime importance for the breeders. indeed, it has the highest muscularity and up to 80 % of the semen used in french production comes from piétrain breed. moreover, the gender effect may be reduced by the fact that all males were castrated in this work. we did the analysis without the piétrain breed and the lists of de probes were similar to those obtained with the piétrain breed . the functional enrichment is hence similar for pairwise comparisons involving all breeds except the piétrain.

functional annotation
tables  <dig> and  <dig> underline the large number of gene lists to be analysed for biological interpretation. the functional analysis was undertaken in a sequential manner. first, the objective was to evaluate the impact of the sex effect of the piétrain breed. while it would have been possible to restrict the functional analysis to autosomal genes, excluding important genes such as igf <dig>  may give unreliable results. therefore, the list of the  <dig>  de probes from the union of the global and pairwise comparisons restricted to autosomes was compared to the same list plus the  <dig> de probes localised on chromosomes x and y . the free genecodis software  <cit>  was used and the comparison was restricted to kegg pathways, which are a collection of manually drawn pathway maps representing our knowledge on the molecular interaction and reaction networks. the top  <dig> significant pathways were exactly the same between both lists with or without genes on sex chromosomes . according to the weak effect of the analysis restricted to autosomes on the pca projection and on functional analysis, we hypothesize a low impact of the sex effect on our breed comparison, even if this effect could not be absolutely excluded.

the lists of de genes from the union of global and pairwise analysis restricted  or not  to autosomes were compared through genecodis.

whatever the input lists of de genes to identify pathways significantly involved in the genetic expression diversity in muscle, the biological functions affected were almost the same . finally, the functional analysis was restricted to the  <dig>  de probes  from the global analysis, and only kegg pathways are presented. seventy signaling and metabolic pathways were significantly enriched . the most relevant pathways are presented in table  <dig> and details of enriched pathways are summarized in additional file  <dig>  among these seventy pathways, twenty-five included one pi3k gene . these pathways correspond to focal adhesion, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, interactions between cells or with the extracellular matrix ; these pathways involved  <dig> genes.table  <dig> relevant and significantly enriched biological functions  for diversity of muscle expression for five pig breeds

breed discrimination
a differential expression analysis aims at giving a list of genes whose transcript abundances differ significantly among classes . a discriminant analysis aims at identifying transcripts whose abundance differences help clustering  each breed from the others. it helps predicting the breed to which a rna sample belongs to, based on a list of “discriminant” genes. although related, these  <dig> notions are different. in general a discriminant gene is a differential gene, but the reverse is not always true. among a vast choice of discriminant methods, we performed a random forest  analysis  <cit>  which is robust and non-linear and a sparse partial least square – discriminant analysis   <cit>  that is pertaining to linear discriminators.

firstly, it was impossible to determine whether a large white sample originated from a female line or a male line with rf . hence the two lines were merged in a single large white  breed in the following. we were interested in probe importance to identify stable predictors. the mean decrease gini and mean decrease accuracy importance gave almost identical results. the importance pertaining to each breed was also looked at to detect predictors for a particular breed. all the spots with the highest importance for a breed were included in a list of top  <dig> probes with the highest mean decrease accuracy. these  <dig> probes corresponded to  <dig> unique gene names. to avoid an unbalanced weight on some genes due to the redundancy on the chip , a heatmap with  <dig> genes  was displayed, and provided in fig.  <dig>  the four breeds were perfectly separated with these  <dig> genes by a hierarchical clustering.fig.  <dig> heatmap of the annotated genes with the highest importance in breed prediction . the  <dig> spots with highest mean decrease accuracy importance correspond to  <dig> annotated genes. piétrain  animals are displayed in green, landrace  in blue, duroc  in brown, large white  in red



secondly, a spls-da was conducted with three dimensions. a 10-fold cross validation led to a choice of  <dig> variables  for the first dimension, around  <dig> for the second and  <dig> for the third dimensions. the first dimension separated piétrain from the other breeds . the second dimension allowed landrace and large white to be discriminated, while on the third and last dimension duroc was opposed to the other breeds. the correlations of the probe loadings with the principal axes are given on fig. 5b, and allowed a list of discriminant probes  to be extracted.fig.  <dig> spls-da with  spots selected on  <dig> dimensions. plots of individuals  and correlations  between components and selected spots. piétrain  animals are displayed in green, landrace  in blue, duroc  in brown, large white  in red



all these results are detailed in additional file  <dig> combined with the de probes which are differential from one breed compared to the others. the total list was composed of  <dig> probes that corresponded to  <dig> unique annotated genes. a short list of  <dig> genes was defined from the above three analysis , and will be discussed in more depth in the following discussion .table  <dig> top  <dig> discriminant genes for breeds

discussion
the present work highlights the variability of the expression of about  <dig>  transcripts between five pig breeds. these genes were identified for global differences , and a pairwise analysis . a subset of  <dig> transcripts was identified to be able to discriminate the five breeds in one way or another. a short list of  <dig>  as the intersection of all lists, was extracted. altogether, the union of all these highlighted transcripts corresponded to  <dig>  unique genes.

variability of expression between breeds mainly concerns pi3kinase signaling pathways involved in the regulation of muscle mass
biological functions enrichment analysis gave a large number of significant results. the most significant result is the huge number of genes involved in signaling pathways. especially, the pi <dig> kinase pathways appeared to be the most relevant with  <dig> signaling pathways including pik3c <dig>  or pik3cg . a schematic and summarized pathway around the pi <dig> kinase checkpoint was drawn  and included only  <dig> out of the  <dig> involved genes. this diagram was constructed according to the description of regulation of muscle mass  <cit> .fig.  <dig> schematic representation of the signaling pathways around pi3-kinase regulating muscle mass and metabolic processes. genes in red are differentially expressed between the five porcine breeds whatever the direction  of the regulation of expression. this representation is a simplified summary of the corresponding kegg pathways with only about  <dig> genes from the  <dig> involved



muscle mass is determined by both the number of muscle fibres and the size of these fibres. the development of muscle is temporally regulated and the total fibre number is fixed before birth  in pigs  <cit> . afterwards, increase in muscle mass may be the consequence of mechanisms regulating muscle hypertrophy like the size of the fibres. in our study, muscle samples were collected at slaughter. animals were about six months old and weighted around 110 kg. therefore the expression analysis corresponds probably more to the hypertrophic process if existing. this hypothetical statement is in accordance with the results of the enrichment analysis that highlighted signaling pathways most regulated by pi <dig> kinase and known to be involved in the regulation of muscle mass. then transcriptomic diversity between the five breeds underlined how these pathways regulating muscle mass may have been targeted by selection to increase lean meat production.

upstream to the pi3k signaling pathway, regulated de genes referred to interactions between cells or with the extracellular matrix  together with focal adhesion. these pathways are the three among the four top signaling pathways presented in table  <dig> and in fig.  <dig>  de genes products are presented at the ecm and cell membrane localization. this result is consistent with the importance of the ecm highlighted in muscle cattle in development  <cit> . as reviewed by  <cit> , the extracellular matrix  is established to be a key player in muscle growth. ecm was most often described as an inactive component of cells. but many studies across species have now highlighted ecm functions, e.g. filtering, activating/inhibiting enzymatic activities, binding hormones, enzymes, and regulating the interaction of several ligands with their receptors. most of the constituents of the ecm are mainly produced locally by the adjacent cells and most often by the fibroblasts present in the muscle tissue.

also, pi <dig> kinase pathways regulate some energy metabolic pathways such as glycolysis and glycogenesis. then selection on muscle mass may have also affected the regulation of these metabolic pathways. for example it has been suggested that decades of selection for more lean meat  and larger litter size, may have increased piglet neonatal mortality  <cit> . as piglets have no brown adipose tissue, piglet thermoregulation at birth is essentially carried out by the skeletal muscle . it may be hypothesized that impaired glycolytic metabolism at birth, which is essential to ensure body thermoregulation, has been affected by genetic selection, affecting gene expression between breeds .

identification of some breeds specificities
 <dig> genes that discriminate duroc, pietrain and large white
a total of  <dig> unique annotated genes were identified as able to differentiate the breeds. among these  <dig> genes ,  <dig> genes were common in the two discriminant methods  and the pairwise differential analysis . these  <dig> genes may be very interesting to better characterize the differences between the breeds. none of these genes were located on the sexual chromosome, which may imply they are less affected by the sex effect  observed in this work.

duroc
from these  <dig> genes, six genes differentiate the duroc from the other breeds. among the four genes under-expressed in duroc, two genes are specifically known to be involved in skin coloration: kit  and oca <dig> . both genes are coding transporter proteins and are involved in biological processes as transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway for kit and tyrosine transport for oca <dig>  oca <dig> gene was found over-expressed in white muscle  compared to red muscle  in meishan pig  <cit> . it is interesting to observe how genes related to skin colour and maybe submitted to selection may affect another tissue important for production traits. the term “melanocyte differentiation” was the first enriched gene ontology  with kit and oca <dig> genes; duroc pigs are brown-red.

two genes are over-expressed in duroc, tjp <dig>  and psmb <dig>  subunit, beta type, 4). tjp <dig> is a membrane-associated guanylate kinase and encoded protein functions as a component of the tight junction barrier for cellular permeability involved in intercellular communication  <cit> . moreover there is some evidence that at least another zonula occludens protein  is involved in vascular remodelling processes  <cit> . these biological functions, cellular permeability and vascular remodelling, are interesting functions related to muscle meat traits, especially water holding capacity  <cit> . similarly, the proteasomic proteins  has a major role in degrading proteins in muscle cells  <cit>  and the proteasome might be one of the endogenous proteolytic system contributing to meat texture development  <cit> . psmb <dig> with vdr, kit and oca <dig> genes are involved in “reproduction process” . for example, the vdr  gene is known to be involved in male reproduction  <cit> . in humans, it was observed to be down-regulated with leaner patient  <cit>  and allelic variations in the vdr gene were identified to be associated with lean body mass and height in human  <cit> . in french pig production the duroc is used to obtain terminal boars.

piétrain
in this study, five genes were identified to differentiate the piétrain line from the others. four genes were under-expressed in piétrain compared to the others . the naa <dig> gene -acetyltransferase  <dig>  natb catalytic subunit or nat <dig> gene) encodes a protein involved in normal cell proliferation and it functions in posttranslational protein n-terminal acetylation process  <cit> . some specific proteins targeted by this n-terminal acetyltransferase were identified e.g. actin and tropomyosin; the human natb complex depletion perturbs actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesion organization  <cit> . the mob3c gene , member of the mob protein family, has been shown to regulate mitosis, cell proliferation, apoptosis, centrosome biology and morphological changes  <cit> . the rngtt gene  encodes a rna guanylyltransferase involved in the regulation of gene expression with capping the 5′end of the mrna . rgntt was identified to be a potential candidate gene for average daily feed intake but not in piétrain pigs  <cit> . the dph <dig>  gene is a component of the diphthamide synthesis pathway . this pathway regulates post-translational modifications  <cit> . none of these four genes are directly linked with the characteristic phenotypes of piétrain . the fifth and up-regulated gene in piétrain is pik3cg . pik3cg is the only gene with a possible link with conformation as is one of the genes involved in the regulation of muscle mass .

large white sire and dam lines
the male and female large white lines were difficult to differentiate from each other. six probes corresponding to five unique annotated genes were found significantly different with a relatively low fdr . among these five genes, four  were overexpressed in the male line and are coding for proteins with nuclear localizations. one of these genes was nlrc <dig>  and is the largest member of the nlr protein family . nlrc <dig> is an intracellular receptor involved in innate immune sensing; it is induced by interferons in case of pathogen infection  <cit> . it is also involved in the regulation of kinase activity and nf-kappab transcription factor activity . the three other genes have mechanistic nuclear roles. rad <dig> codes a cell cycle checkpoint protein required for cell cycle arrest and dna damage repair. dhx <dig>  box polypeptide 33) is identified to code a protein with an important role in rrna transcription and cell proliferation. cpne <dig>  codes a calcium-dependent membrane-binding protein that may regulate molecular events at the interface of the cell membrane and cytoplasm. only one gene, prkrip <dig> ) gene was over-expressed in large white dam line. little functional information is available for this gene except a negative regulation of protein kinase activity  but it may play a role in cytokine-mediated biological functions  <cit> .

landrace
igf <dig> was among the few genes able to discriminate the landrace from the others with random forest and the pairwise analysis . one surprising point is that the spls-da didn’t identify igf <dig> as a discriminant gene. the over-expression of igf <dig> in the other breeds is probably the consequence of the mutation in the igf <dig> intron <dig> g.3072g > a  <cit>  which leads to an increased muscle mass and a reduced backfat deposition. this mutation has detrimental effects in prolificacy described as a result of an excess of leanness diminishing reproductive performance of the sow  <cit> . in french breeds, the mutation favorable  to increase muscle mass seems fixed in large white, piétrain and duroc, while the allelic frequency is always segregating in landrace .

the second gene identified as landrace specific was lbr . lbr encodes an integral inner nuclear membrane protein. this protein is involved in the sequestration of heterochromatin near the periphery and the nucleoli in mammalian nuclei  <cit>  and also in sterol metabolism  <cit> .

transcriptomic diversity among breeds
genetic diversity of western pig breeds and lines has been studied over the past years using a range of genetic markers . a clear separation of breeds was observed at markers that were specifically chosen to vary across breeds. on the transcriptome level, we observed here that breeds were also clearly separated on differential probes. the differential aspect of probes is equivalent to the pre-selection of genetic markers. in this study, after eliminating the confounding effect of sex and piétrain, duroc animals are the most distant to other breeds; that corresponds to the genetic basis and historical knowledge . then piétrain and large white are the most distant, again as with the genetic markers. so the overall picture of breed differentiation is most probably the same at the genomic and transcriptomic level.

specific statistical tools are now able to detect signatures of selection at the transcriptomic level and compare them to the ones at the genomic level. this will be the focus of future work.

however, transcriptomic differences across breeds may reveal the impact of selection and help understanding genetic and phenotypic changes. perez-enciso et al.  <cit>  also reported interesting patterns of differential gene expression across breeds in a study involving  <dig> animals per breed . they observed hierarchical clusterings of breeds differing with tissues. even if the five tissues were chosen from the endocrine axis , it is interesting to note that muscle differentiation was highlighted in their breeds’ transcriptomic differentiation.

more studies are needed to understand the effects of the various evolutionary forces  on the transcriptome of pig breeds.

CONCLUSIONS
we found numerous differences in gene expression across the main pig western breeds. their functional analysis highlighted which biological function differed between these breeds and more precisely which genes from these functions differed between breeds. we hypothesized that these genes and related biological functions may have been targeted by human management  on production traits. the ideal situation would be that only terminal mechanisms  for production traits vary across breeds. however our results showed that a multi-functional signaling pathway  was affected. this pathway is well-known to be involved in the regulation of muscle mass and may impact the production traits that are selected for, but also “functional” traits around the regulation of metabolic pathway such as glycolysis. moreover, most of the top discriminant genes between breeds were found to affect fundamental transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. these results could suggest how animal management and/or genetic selection may impact not only the terminal mechanisms of production traits but also the fundamental regulation of cellular processes such as regulation of gene expression and signaling pathways. further analysis will help to decipher if robustness in farm animals was also impacted.
