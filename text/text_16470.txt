BACKGROUND
staphylococcus aureus is a versatile opportunistic pathogen that causes a variety of infections ranging from superficial skin infections to severe, invasive diseases such as bacteraemia and necrotising pneumonia  <cit> . its success as a human pathogen is highlighted by the fact that despite the development of antibiotic therapy, the frequency of staphylococcal bacteraemias is increasing  <cit> . developments in medicine can at least be partly attributed to this rise as an increasing number of staphylococcal infections are related to the use of joint prostheses, immunosuppressants and catheters  <cit> . indeed, s. aureus is the most frequent cause of surgical site infections, accounting for 38% of infections reported in the uk during the period january  <dig> to december  <dig>  <cit> .

methicillin-resistant s. aureus  accounts for a high proportion of surgical site infections caused by s. aureus, being responsible for 64% of such infections in 2007/ <dig>  <cit> . fewer than 5% of s. aureus isolates are now sensitive to penicillin, once the drug of choice for staphylococcal infections  <cit> . mrsa was first reported in the united kingdom just two years after the introduction of methicillin in  <dig>  <cit> . horizontal transfer of the meca gene, which encodes a penicillin-binding protein, results in resistance not only to methicillin, but also to broad spectrum β-lactams such as the third-generation cephalosporins, cefamycins and carbapenems  <cit> . the proportion of mrsa isolates from blood cultures taken from cases of bacteraemia in england has risen dramatically from less than 5% in  <dig> to around 40% by the end of the 1990s  <cit> . as well as mortality rates of almost double those associated with methicillin-sensitive s. aureus  infections, mrsa has put a considerable financial burden on both hospitals and society in general  <cit> .

over  <dig> different virulence factors have been identified in s. aureus; these are involved in almost all processes from colonisation of the host to nutrition and dissemination  <cit> . s. aureus produces a wide range of enzymes and toxins that are thought to be involved in the conversion of host tissues into nutrients for bacterial growth  <cit>  in addition to having numerous modulatory effects on the host immune response  <cit> .

the increasing resistance of pathogenic bacteria such as s. aureus to antibiotics has led to the search for new antimicrobial strategies, and photodynamic therapy  is emerging as a promising alternative. the photodynamic inactivation of bacteria relies upon the capacity of a light-activated antimicrobial agent  to generate reactive oxygen species on irradiation with light of a suitable wavelength. reactive oxygen species can oxidise many biological structures such as proteins, nucleic acids and lipids. as the mechanism of action of microbial killing is non-specific and multiple sites are affected, it is considered unlikely that resistance will evolve  <cit> , thus representing a significant advantage over conventional antibiotic treatment where resistance is an ever-increasing problem. a very desirable feature of pdt is the potential for inactivation of virulence factors, particularly secreted proteins, by reactive oxygen species  <cit> .

the biological activities of some virulence factors produced by gram-negative bacteria have been shown to be successfully reduced by photodynamic action. the inhibitory effect of red laser light and the photosensitiser toluidine blue o  on virulence factors from escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit>  and porphyromonas gingivalis  <cit>  has previously been demonstrated; however the effect on staphylococcal virulence factors has not been investigated.

in this study, we have investigated the effect of photosensitisation using methylene blue and laser light of  <dig> nm on some of the key virulence factors of s. aureus. the use of methylene blue is well established in medicine where it is used for the routine staining of vital organs and the treatment of septic shock  <cit> .

RESULTS
emrsa-16
methylene blue and laser light of  <dig> nm was found to successfully kill emrsa- <dig>  as shown by figures  <dig> and  <dig>  treatment of emrsa- <dig> with  <dig> μm methylene blue and a laser light dose of  <dig>  j/cm <dig> resulted in an approximate 4-log reduction in viability, corresponding to  <dig> % kill. after irradiation with  <dig>  j/cm <dig> laser light in the presence of  <dig> μm methylene blue, an approximate 6-log reduction in viability was achieved, corresponding to a  <dig> % kill, demonstrating the effectiveness of this regimen against mrsa.

v <dig> protease
the effect of methylene blue and laser light on the proteolytic activity of the v <dig> protease as determined by the azocasein-hydrolysis assay is shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  one unit of activity was defined as that which caused a change in absorbance of  <dig>  in one hour at  <dig> nm. figure  <dig> shows that the activity of the v <dig> protease was inhibited in a photosensitiser concentration-dependent manner, with a decrease in proteolytic activity of 75% being achieved with the highest concentration of methylene blue tested  upon irradiation for  <dig> minute with laser light . photosensitisation of emrsa- <dig> using the same conditions resulted in an approximate 4-log reduction in viability, showing that inactivation of this enzyme is effective within the parameters required to kill s. aureus in vitro. figure  <dig> shows the effect of light dose on the activity of the v <dig> protease after exposure to laser light for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> minutes, corresponding to energy densities of  <dig>  j/cm <dig>   <dig>  j/cm <dig> and  <dig>  j/cm <dig> respectively. inactivation was also seen to be light dose-dependent and a 100% reduction in proteolytic activity was achieved following  <dig> minutes irradiation with laser light in the presence of  <dig> μm methylene blue. neither laser light nor methylene blue alone had an inhibitory effect on the activity of the v <dig> protease. sds page analysis  showed that after exposure to laser light and methylene blue, the bands derived from the v <dig> protease appeared to be progressively more smeared and of lower intensity with increased irradiation time, demonstrating that photosensitisation may cause a change in the protein, perhaps due to oxidation of the protein. a band of  <dig> kda was expected for the v <dig> protease; however the gel showed some degradation of the v <dig> protease that could not be inhibited by the addition of a protease inhibitor.

α-haemolysin
an equal volume of either  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> μm methylene blue or pbs was added to s. aureus α-haemolysin and samples were either exposed to  <dig>  j/cm <dig> laser light  or kept in the dark . after irradiation/dark incubation, samples were serially diluted and an equal volume of 4% rabbit erythrocytes was added. following incubation in the dark at 37°c for one hour, the haemolytic titre was recorded. the haemolytic titre is defined as the highest dilution giving rise to haemolysis. experiments were performed twice in duplicate and a representative experiment is shown.

an equal volume of either  <dig> μm methylene blue  or pbs  was added to s. aureus α-haemolysin and samples were either exposed to laser light doses of  <dig>  j/cm <dig>   <dig>  j/cm <dig> and  <dig>  j/cm <dig>  or kept in the dark . after irradiation/dark incubation, samples were serially diluted and an equal volume of 4% rabbit erythrocytes was added. following incubation in the dark at 37°c for one hour, the haemolytic titre was recorded. the haemolytic titre is the highest dilution giving rise to haemolysis. experiments were performed twice in triplicate and a representative experiment is shown.

sphingomyelinase
the activity of s. aureus sphingomyelinase was inhibited by treatment with methylene blue and laser light in a dose-dependent manner, as shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  one unit of activity was defined as that which caused a change in absorbance of  <dig>  in one minute at  <dig> nm. interestingly, laser light alone appeared to have a slight effect on the activity of the enzyme, although this was not statistically significant . irradiation with  <dig>  j/cm <dig> laser light in the presence of  <dig> μm methylene blue achieved a 76% decrease in the activity of sphingomyelinase, which is comparable to the decrease in activity seen for the v <dig> protease ; these photosensitisation conditions correspond to an approximate 4-log reduction in viable emrsa- <dig> and therefore inactivation is effective with light and energy doses required for the effective killing of bacteria. after irradiation with  <dig>  j/cm <dig> laser light in the presence of  <dig> μm methylene blue, a decrease in activity of 92% was observed. neither dark incubation of the enzyme with the photosensitiser alone nor irradiation in the absence of methylene blue had a significant effect on the activity of the sphingomyelinase. irradiation of the sphingomyelinase in the presence of  <dig> % human serum did not have an effect on the ability of photosensitisation to inactivate the enzyme. photosensitisation using  <dig> μm methylene blue and the lowest laser light dose  resulted in a decrease in the enzyme's activity of 70% ± 12% in the presence of human serum, compared to a decrease of 76% ± 10% in the absence of serum. this difference was not found to be statistically significant .

discussion
packer et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that proteolytic enzymes of the periodontal pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis could be inactivated using the photosensitiser toluidine blue o and red laser light with a wavelength of  <dig> nm. the results presented here support these findings, with a highly significant reduction in the activity of s. aureus v <dig> protease being achieved with a light dose as low as  <dig>  j/cm <dig> in combination with a low  concentration of methylene blue. this inactivation was found to be dose-dependent, with the highest concentration of methylene blue tested  and irradiation with  <dig>  j/cm <dig> laser light achieving a 100% reduction in activity compared to non-treated samples. treatment of emrsa- <dig> under the same conditions resulted in a  <dig> % kill, indicating that inactivation of secreted proteases may be possible as well as eradicating infecting bacteria.

proteases are responsible for the destruction of host tissues both directly and indirectly; inactivation of these enzymes using pdt could therefore limit the damage to the host, as well as killing the infecting organism. it has been suggested that thev <dig> protease plays an important role in the pathogenesis of s. aureus, as strains lacking this enzyme show reduced virulence in a number of infection models  <cit> . of particular relevance is a murine abscess model, in which inactivation of v <dig> protease resulted in significant attenuation of virulence  <cit> ; therefore inactivation of this enzyme by pdt may be able to reduce the virulence potential of s. aureus in other hosts.

as staphylococcal proteases and the colonisation of atopic skin by s. aureus have been implicated in the pathogenicity of atopic dermatitis  <cit> , the inactivation of proteolytic enzymes could have particular relevance for the decontamination of infected lesions using pdt. pdt using the combination of methylene blue and laser light of  <dig> nm may therefore be of use in the treatment of atopic skin disorders. in fact, pdt has long been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of atopic skin disorders, for example the use of ultraviolet light and 8-methoxypsoralen for the treatment of atopic dermatitis  <cit> . clearly, the combination of elimination of disease-exacerbating microorganisms and neutralisation of virulence factors would be extremely advantageous to the treatment of these diseases.

the treatment of α-haemolysin with methylene blue and laser light resulted in an effective inhibition of haemolytic activity. concentrations of methylene blue ranging from 1- <dig> μm all had an inhibitory effect on α-haemolysin when irradiated with laser light, and α-haemolysin was shown to be inactivated after an irradiation time of just  <dig> minute  when in the presence of  <dig> μm methylene blue. the results shown here demonstrate that α-haemolysin is the most susceptible of the virulence factors tested, perhaps due to the nature of its amino acid composition, which may leave it more vulnerable to attack by reactive oxygen species. these data indicate that photodynamic inactivation of this toxin is highly effective and as such, could significantly attenuate the virulence of s. aureus due to the multiple functions of α-haemolysin as a virulence factor.

the haemolysins of s. aureus are membrane-damaging toxins that are capable of lysing a number of different cell types. α-haemolysin is thought to be important in infection as it has a number of detrimental effects on host cells due to the disruption of ion transport across host cell membranes, ultimately leading to apoptotic cell death and oedema  <cit> . α-haemolysin can cause cell death in different ways depending on the concentration of the toxin. at high concentrations, α-haemolysin forms large pores in lipid bilayers that result in massive necrosis, whilst low doses result in the formation of small pores that result in apoptosis and dna fragmentation  <cit> . the role of α-haemolysin in the virulence of s. aureus has been demonstrated in a number of infection models such as mastitis  <cit>  and pneumonia  <cit> . it has also been proposed that α-haemolysin may play a role in colonisation of epithelia by attenuating bacterial clearance from the epithelial surface  <cit> ; this could therefore be of relevance to the decontamination of nasal epithelia using pdt. in addition, α-haemolysin has immunomodulatory properties, notably its ability to trigger the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β  <cit> ; thus inactivation of α-haemolysin by pdt may also protect against harmful inflammatory processes as well as eliminating infecting organisms.

the treatment of s. aureus sphingomyelinase with laser light and methylene blue resulted in a significant, dose-dependent reduction in the enzyme's activity. laser light alone also appeared to reduce the activity of sphingomyelinase; however this was found to be not statistically significant. irradiation of sphingomyelinase with  <dig>  j/cm <dig> laser light in the presence of the highest concentration of methylene blue tested  achieved a highly significant reduction in the activity of the enzyme , which was comparable to the reduction in activity observed for the v <dig> protease when irradiated for the same time period. this reduction in activity was increased to 92% after irradiation of the enzyme for  <dig> minutes in the presence of  <dig> μm methylene blue. production of sphingomyelinase  is thought to be of importance in severe, chronic skin infections, and strains of s. aureus producing high levels of this enzyme have been shown to cause more intense skin lesions than low-producing strains  <cit> . inactivation of these toxins may therefore be of notable relevance to the treatment of superficial staphylococcal skin infections. sphingomyelinase has recently been shown to kill proliferating t lymphocytes, suggesting a role for this toxin in evasion of the host immune response  <cit> ; hence inactivation of sphingomyelinase by pdt could also reduce the immunomodulatory properties of s. aureus.

the photodynamic inactivation of α-haemolysin and sphingomyelinase was shown to be unaffected by the presence of human serum at concentrations resembling the protein content of an acute wound <cit> , indicating that photodynamic therapy may be effective in inactivating these virulence factors in vivo. together with the data showing that pdt using methylene blue and  <dig> nm laser light is effective against a methicillin-resistant strain of s. aureus, this supports the potential of pdt as a treatment for superficial staphylococcal infections.

the precise mechanism of inhibition of these virulence factors has not yet been determined; however it is possible that the reactive oxygen species formed during photosensitisation can oxidise proteins, thereby disrupting their function  <cit> . oxidation of active site groups has been suggested as the mechanism of action for the photodynamic inactivation of the proteolytic enzymes of p. gingivalis  <cit> . sds page analysis of the v <dig> protease and α-haemolysin demonstrated that photosensitisation caused changes to the proteins which resulted in smearing of the protein bands. we propose that singlet oxygen may play a role in the inactivation of v <dig> protease as a protective effect is observed when photosensitisation is performed in the presence of the singlet oxygen scavenger l-tryptophan .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the results of this study suggest that photosensitisation with methylene blue and laser light of  <dig> nm may be able to reduce the virulence potential of s. aureus, as well as effectively killing the organism. inactivation of α-haemolysin and sphingomyelinase is not affected by the presence of human serum, indicating that pdt may be effective against these toxins in vivo. considering the extensive damage virulence factors can cause to host tissues, the ability to inhibit their activity would be a highly desirable feature for any antimicrobial treatment regimen and would represent a significant advantage over conventional antibiotic strategies.
