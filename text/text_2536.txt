BACKGROUND
to date, many evolutionary studies have focused on conservation of protein coding sequences between species, however, gene expression patterns across species can also be used for evolutionary studies  <cit> . the focus of this study is on the proximal promoter  <cit> . proximal promoters consist of a heterogeneous collection of smaller regulatory elements including transcription factor binding sites . tfbss are short dna sequences which bind transcription factors that modulate the level of expression of their cognate gene  <cit> . many stimulatory tfbss are positioned near the transcription start site , within the proximal promoter region  <cit> . in some cases, co-regulated genes or tissue-specific genes contain a common set of tfbss and are controlled by same transcription factors. analysis of promoter regions is one of the major approaches in understanding the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. hence, by identifying the binding sites in the promoters, the pattern of transcriptional regulation may be inferred  <cit> . tissue specific promoters, such as those examined in this study often have a single dominant peak and clustering of sequence specific factor binding sites around the tss  <cit> .

the region analysed in this study is  <dig> bases prior to the tss. deletion assays of the region  <dig> bases prior to the tss of  <dig> encode promoters  <cit>  indicated positional preference, relative to the tss, for elements that contribute negatively and positively to the promoter activity. negative elements resided between - <dig> to - <dig> bp upstream of the tss, while the positive elements were placed closer to the tss, between - <dig> to - <dig> bp upstream of the tss in 55% of the genes tested  <cit> . these conclusions supported previous analyses of functional regions in promoter sequences where it has been established that most  of promoters spanning  <dig> bp upstream of the tss had significant transcriptional activity, indicating that the region contains active binding sites  <cit> . this study does not examine cis-regulatory elements, particularly in enhancers and silencers outside this region  <cit> .

co-expressed genes can be determined by a number of techniques, such as microarray experiments or est profiling. these methods usually examine a subset of genes in the genome. however, identifying common tfbss in these genes allows one to infer the mechanism of co-regulation, establishing genome-wide frequencies of the tfbss, and detect additional co-regulated genes not present on the array or detected in the original est library. this approach also has the major benefit that it is sequence-based and is less dependent on prior knowledge on which many other methods of interpreting genomic studies depend. the current challenge is to extend this technique from well-characterised model species, such as human, to those with limited genomic annotation information, such as cattle.

in order to test the feasibility of using the human genome as a reference set for motif prediction, we used a set of bovine and human expression data from cardiac tissue. initially, we used the homologous human genes and identified a set of motifs common in the promoter regions of the genes. to determine which transcription factors might bind to the predicted motifs and regulate the genes, the motifs were compared with previously described tfbss and their best hit among known binding sites was identified. these results were then compared with the orthologous bovine promoter sequences where available, applying the same procedure. finally, we combined and contrasted the various approaches and data sets and examined the underlying substructure of the results using clustering of motif frequencies in the promoter sequences.

we propose and test a general method to deduce regulatory motifs in promoter regions of mammalian species with restricted genomic sequence by using a well-characterised reference genome.

RESULTS
analysis of a de novo motif prediction and identification method
common motifs in promoter sequences were detected using the motif prediction programme meme  <cit> . in a recent survey of tools for promoter motif prediction meme performed well among the thirteen different tools that were assessed  <cit> . sequences were analysed on both strands for common cis-regulatory elements of length  <dig> –  <dig> bp. the predicted elements were subsequently compared to the tfbs databases transfac  <cit>  and jaspar  <cit> , for identification of the motifs as potential regulatory elements. for each predicted motif, a series of matches were produced, each representing the best hit from their corresponding length category by a scoring mechanism . to determine significant matches, a permutation test was also performed.

the approach of de novo motif prediction and identification of these motifs as tfbss was validated using the well-characterised and well-adopted muscle-specific regulatory elements collection and the five related tfbss described by wasserman and fickett  <cit> . the human subset of this collection comprising  <dig> sequences and the five matrices acted as the training set .

comparison between matrices for the predicted motifs  in human muscle specific set  and those for the binding sites previously determined identified three of the five sites . this indicated that the process had correctly predicted the majority of the matrices. the best match to motif a <dig> was myocyte enhancer factor  <dig>  with a dissimilarity score  of  <dig>  and p-value  of  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  motifs a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig> all matched sp <dig>  with a <dig> having the lowest score. the best binding site for the myf transcription factor was motif a <dig> with a score of  <dig>  and p-value of  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  motif a <dig> also matched to myf but with a higher score of  <dig>  . matches to tef- <dig> and srf were not significant .

the predicted motifs of the muscle specific set were also compared to the transfac and jaspar databases. several motifs had significant matches, with dissimilarity scores below the selected threshold of  <dig> , and p-values less than  <dig>  . comparison of the predicted meme motifs with the entries in the two databases again identified the first motif  as a mef <dig> binding site. motif a <dig>  although identified as a binding site for the churchill domain containing  <dig> protein , is highly similar to the binding site for the sp <dig> transcription factor  <cit> . structurally, the churchill site is similar to the binding site for the sp <dig> factor and hence the a <dig> motif may be an sp <dig> binding site. the transfac sp1_q <dig> and sp1_q2_ <dig> matrices, both representing binding sites for the ubiquitous sp <dig> transcription factor, match to a <dig> with low scores , but non-significant p-values . the a <dig> motif was identified as a binding site for the myf factor in jaspar, confirming the previous annotation of this motif.

sequences in the muscle-specific gene set were examined with meme for de novo prediction of motifs. the resulting motifs were subsequently compared to entries in the transfac and jaspar databases for identification. for each identified motif, the dissimilarity score  and the p-value  are shown. corrected p-value for each match is based on an estimated fdr of 10%. matches to the jaspar database are marked by .

motifs a <dig> and a <dig> had significant hits to known tfbs which were different to the expected binding sites. the a <dig> motif matched the complementary strand to pou6f1_ <dig>  the corresponding factor for this matrix is the pou domain, class  <dig>  transcription factor  <dig>  the gene encoding this protein has been shown to be expressed in muscle tissues and is involved in transcriptional regulation of several genes in cardiac tissue  <cit> . the a <dig> motif had a high similarity to tel2_q <dig> and its related matrix ets_q <dig>  both belonging to the v-ets erythroblastosis virus e <dig> oncogene gene family.

none of the remaining motifs had matches that met the selection criteria and, therefore, they may represent novel regulatory elements. to estimate false positive rates one thousand randomisations of the original  <dig> sequences were done and motifs predicted. among the original set of predicted motifs, seven had no similar hits in the  <dig> randomisation sets  . four of these are novel a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  although a <dig> has some similarity to the myognf1_ <dig> site, the myogenin binding site.

screening all  <dig> equivalent refseq promoters using mast gave the genome-wide frequencies of the predicted motifs. motif a <dig> is the most frequent among the promoters  . the other four motifs similar to known sites, that is a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig>  had less than  <dig> occurrences in the promoters, suggesting that they may be restricted to a subset of genes.

comparison of the de novo predicted motifs in the muscle specific set  with three sets of known tfbss demonstrates that the methodology adopted for the analysis found both known and novel motifs. five of the  <dig> unique motifs  could be identified as resembling known tfbss. the most significant novel motifs were a <dig> and a <dig> . these two motifs were common in the dataset with  <dig> and  <dig> occurrences but absent in the control randomisation sets .

analysis of genes expressed in bovine cardiac cdna libraries and homologous human genes 
this group of human genes serves as a model set of data representing a genome for which expression data are available but there is limited genomic sequence. bovine expression data, based on est sequences were analysed for cardiac-specific expression using two independent methods . one method exclusively employed the bovine est frequency in each tissue library , while the other used human cardiac expression data in addition to the bovine data .

asterisks  indicate common human genes with group b.

the est sequences from  <dig> selected bovine tissue libraries were assembled into contigs and those contigs containing six or more ests were retained. these contigs were then analysed for cardiac tissue specific expression and  <dig> were selected. putative human homologues for the contigs were obtained through blastn analysis  <cit> , by comparing the bovine contig consensus sequences to the human refseq database , giving rise to  <dig> unique human refseq genes . the genes include well-known muscle-specific genes encoding sarcomeric or sarcomeric-associated proteins, such as troponin t type  <dig>  and troponin i type  <dig> , myosin binding protein c  and other myosin-related genes.

a segment of  <dig> bp upstream of the tss for each of the genes was analysed for common cis-regulatory elements. this region is expected to contain most of the binding sites that are involved in transcription initiation  <cit> .

promoter sequences for the  <dig> human genes were examined with meme for prediction of motifs common to the group. the resulting motifs were then compared to entries in the transfac and jaspar databases for identification. for each identified motif the dissimilarity score  and the p-value  are shown. corrected p-value for each match is based on an estimated fdr of 10%. matches to the jaspar database are marked by . sequence logos for the matrices are given in figure  <dig> 

analysis of genes expressed in bovine muscle cdna libraries and human cardiac tissue 
a group of  <dig> bovine est contigs  expressed specifically in four muscle and cardiac libraries was selected .

comparison with the human genome identified  <dig> unique human refseq genes . these were later filtered for expression in human cardiac tissue using microarray expression ratios  <cit>  extracted from the ucsc genome browser. of the  <dig> human sequences,  <dig> met the cutoff of an expression ratio of >  <dig> in cardiac tissue. therefore, this approach also employs gene expression information from the reference genome. the methodology is useful when the equivalent information in the original genome is not available.

promoter sequences for the above  <dig> genes were analysed as described before. the motif prediction in promoter regions of the human genes identified  <dig> distinct motifs  with no similarities between the motifs. nine of the  <dig> predicted motifs had matches to known tfbss . the sp <dig> binding site was again detected among the motifs . none of the sp <dig> site matches to c <dig> h were significant by the p-value criteria, although the dissimilarity scores for the matches clearly indicate that the site may indeed be a binding site for the sp <dig> factor. other motifs identified in this group are the tata-box element  present in promoters and a binding site for the gata <dig> transcription factor. the gata <dig> protein, a cardiac tissue-specific transcription factor, is expressed in early cardiac progenitor cells  <cit> . the c <dig> h, c <dig> h, c <dig> h and c <dig> h were identified pax <dig>  pax, egrf <dig> and maz binding sites, respectively .

the sequences were analysed by meme to predict common motifs. the resulting motifs were compared to the transfac and jaspar databases for identifying known binding sites. the dissimilarity score  and p-value  for each comparison are shown. corrected p-value for each match is based on an estimated fdr of 10%. matches to the jaspar database are marked by . sequence logos for the matrices are given in figure  <dig> 

analysis of the motifs predicted in group c shows the presence of several potentially muscle-specific regulatory elements found in the promoters of human genes. compared to genes in group b, there was far less redundancy in the predicted motifs, which may be due to slightly larger data sets and also the expression specificity of the selected data, as expression array information may more accurately predict expression than est profiling.

frequency of the predicted motifs in the combined cardiac specific promoters
the unique meme motifs, seven predicted in group b  and all the  <dig> motifs in group c , were combined together . similar motifs were identified and collapsed using mast  <cit> .

the sequences from cardiac groups b and c were combined and eight common sequences were identified, resulting in  <dig> unique sequences. predicted motifs from the two groups were then clustered based on their frequency in all the promoters . this was done to reveal information which may not be obvious from the global motif analysis, for example whether presence and frequency levels of specific motifs can be related to the functions of the corresponding genes. figure  <dig> shows a colour map of the non-redundant motifs and their frequency in the promoter sequences. of the seven unique motifs in group b, five were in common with group c . a distinct group of promoter sequences has the highest frequencies of the c <dig> h_b <dig> h, c <dig> h and c <dig> h motifs . the first two motifs were identified as tfbss for the sp <dig> and gata <dig> transcription factors, respectively. the c <dig> h motif had no matches and may represent a novel motif related to expression of the genes. the promoter group containing these motifs consists of  <dig> sequences, including several of the sarcomeric genes described earlier. this suggests a likely role of the motifs in relation to the common function of the genes. the same group of promoters also display a high frequency of other motifs . these latter motifs also form a subcluster and their presence in the same group of promoters implies possible transcriptional regulation in a modular fashion whereby the presence of several transcription factors is required for activation of transcription. the two subclusters of motifs are also present in another group of promoters  but at a less pronounced frequency. these genes have a number of functions, such as energy pathways, cell communication and cell growth. the promoter sequence of the phospholamban gene  does not cluster with any other sequence and has three distinct motifs at high rates. these motifs were identified as tfbss for the tbp , mef <dig>  and homeodomain of pax <dig>  factors.

an examination of the motif frequency patterns in the promoters shows that five of the seven unique motifs  are in common between the two sets . this is an indication that using the inherent bovine est frequencies in tissue libraries is sufficient for the analysis of regulatory patterns.

the  <dig> promoters predicted by either methods  to be cardiac specific were examined for overlap with cpg islands  <cit> , only  <dig> overlapped. none of the eight promoters predicted by both methods had cpg islands within the  <dig> bases upstream of the tss only one had a tata box within  <dig> bases. this is consistent with our finding of c <dig> h_b <dig> h/gc/sp <dig> sites in these promoters .

analysis of bovine genome sequences
the bovine genome is the first of the artidactyl genomes to be sequenced. the btau <dig> ,  <dig>  fold coverage assembly comprises  <dig>  gb with only 24% in contigs >  <dig> bases. the small contig size creates problems for extraction of regions upstream of the tss or first coding exon. orthologous bovine promoters from the  <dig> human refseqs in group b, were retrieved using ensembl's gene orthology criteria  <cit> . fifteen orthologues could be retrieved .

the  <dig> sequences were analysed as before. of the six unique motifs, three were in common with motifs predicted in their human orthologues corresponding to ap <dig>  and mef <dig>  . two novel motifs  occurred frequently with  <dig> and  <dig> occurrences, in  <dig> and  <dig> of  <dig> sequences .

discussion
a common problem in agricultural science is incomplete genomic sequence for the species of interest, and therefore limited or no access to the promoter sequences. the proposed solution is to identify orthologous genes in related species that have sequenced genomes and extract the relevant promoter regions. these promoters can then be used to search for common regulatory motifs. the approach used here was to examine the promoter regions of co-expressed genes for shared motifs. such a method can identify both known and novel tfbss, it can also potentially identify genes that may be co-expressed but that have not been measured as part of the experiment.

in this paper we present a simple approach for deducing regulatory information in mammalian genomes with restricted sequence by using a reference genome. we evaluate this approach using an independent data set. we used meme  <cit>  for predicting motifs in promoter sequences of the genes. meme performed well in a recent assessment of tools employed for prediction of tfbss  <cit>  and offers a flexible set of parameters.

wasserman and fickett  <cit>  compiled and analysed a group of experimentally verified muscle regulatory regions and discovered the presence of five specific binding sites in these sequences. this human subset  of this collection was used as the training set to evaluate the proposed approach. promoter analysis of sequences in the training set identified three of the five expected binding sites for muscle-specific transcription factors. we identified mef <dig>  sp <dig> and myf binding sites significantly in the set. the srf binding site also matched to the same motif identified as a mef <dig> site . this result suggests that meme may be clustering these two binding sites together due to the similarity at the centre of both sites. the randomisation of the training data also supported this observation. the composition, that is number of sequences and sites that contribute to the structure of a motif, of several low ranking motifs, such as a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig>  were very distinct from motifs generated from the random sequences. hence, the approach used was to examine all  <dig> predicted motifs regardless of their meme reported e-values in the subsequent analyses. we conclude from this initial comparison that our approach and selection criteria identified the majority of the motifs present.

the predicted motifs in group a were also compared to known tfbss in transfac  <cit>  and jaspar  <cit> . these databases are the most comprehensive collection of known tfbss available. the transfac database is the largest available set of known tfbss. the core matrices of many profiles have also been computationally extended – introducing potential redundancy into the data. many of the longer binding sites are contributing to non-specific matches. the size of the jaspar database is much smaller than transfac but it consists of experimentally verified and highly curated profiles. overall in this study more of the transfac hits had p-values <  <dig>  compared to those in jaspar.

the mef <dig> binding site was identified. the mef <dig> gene family members are expressed during early embryogenesis and throughout the developing myocardium and are well-characterised for their involvement in muscle differentiation  <cit> . the conserved dna binding domain in these regulators recognises an at-rich consensus sequence, present in the regulatory regions of many muscle-specific genes  <cit> . the mef <dig> motifs in the transfac and jaspar databases are largely based on in vitro selex data and differ slightly from each other and from that in  <cit> .

sp <dig> like motifs were also be identified, including the chch_ <dig> motif in group a, that is a partial motif of the sp <dig> binding site. the pou6f <dig> binding site identified in the set may be a novel muscle element. pou6f <dig> is a member of the homeobox protein family, involved in developmental processes, and has been shown to be expressed in muscle tissue  <cit> . another potentially novel factor for transcriptional regulation of muscle genes is tel <dig>  a member of the ets family. however, this same motif matched the ets- <dig> motif itself, which has been shown to be involved in cardiac morphogenesis  <cit>  and the tef- <dig> motif in jaspar also matched the same motif, indicating a similar composition in the two motifs.

once we had evaluated our method, we subsequently utilised bovine cdna expression data for the study. contigs resulting from assembling the initial ests were analysed for muscle and cardiac tissue-specific expression using two methods. the first method used only the bovine est frequency per library data. the second method employed both bovine and human expression data. fourteen motifs  of the initially  <dig> predicted motifs in the human promoters were identified as known tfbss. comparison of the unique motifs detected in the human promoters of groups b and c show that 71% in group b are in common between the two sets. these results indicate that even though the genes in the two sets were selected partially independently from each other, they produce similar results.

once promoter sequences sharing common regulatory elements were identified, the combination of motifs present in the promoters could then be used to determine additional substructure within the results using clustering based on the number tfbss present in the promoters. this suggests that the number and order of tfbss present in a promoter encodes information that can be easily extracted from the results of this approach. the eight common promoters contained multiple sp <dig> like sites  and generally lacked cpg islands and tata boxes near to the tss. promoters with these characteristics generally had a single dominant peak of tss  <cit>  in other tissues, but potential alternative promoter starts were not examined in this study.

for the bovine genome two assemblies are currently in use  used here and btau <dig> . the latest assembly has increased the size of the contigs to 61% >  <dig>   <cit> . however, this is still much lower than that of human at 94% >  <dig>  therefore the assembly in regulatory regions, particularly the link between these and the coding regions remains much better for the human genome, and the human genome will remain a useful reference.

however, the current method suffers from some caveats. it does not use all available information, such as co-localisation and order of the tfbss. additionally, the method is not well-suited for determining gene regulation in tissues not shared between species, such as the rumen in artiodactyl mammals. this will therefore impose restrictions on the kind of analyses that may be performed. this barrier will, however, be overcome with a comprehensive annotation of bovine genome.

in the latest version of meme, it is now possible to compare the produced pfms to known motifs in jaspar  <cit> , a procedure similar to this study. it produces similar results but is also limited by the incompleteness of the jaspar database as found here.

examining the evolutionary conservation of the motifs can give further information about individual motifs and their inferred involvement in transcriptional regulation. using available tools for phylogenetic footprinting studies, such as multi-species sequence alignments from public databases, e.g. the ucsc or ensembl genome browsers, can aid in this task. the recently developed phyme  <cit>  and phylogibbs  <cit>  programmes address this proposed approach, using motif over-representation coupled with phylogenetic comparison to calculate significance of the predicted motifs. these will become more powerful as the number of genomes sequenced increases and the coverage and quality of their assembly improve.

CONCLUSIONS
by comparing two methods, both initially based on bovine est data, we show that using human promoter regions as a reference platform in interpreting ruminant expression studies is a viable solution for the analysis of gene regulation patterns in the bovine genome.

the proposed method is simple and easy to implement with existing software and is robust when sufficient co-expressed  sequences can be identified. finally, as the bovine genome becomes better annotated, it can serve as an interim platform for many other agriculturally important animals, such as sheep and goat, until their genome sequences become available.
