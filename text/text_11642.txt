BACKGROUND
the adult brain responds in a remarkable way to physical exercise, enriched environment and motor learning paradigms via morphological, cellular and functional changes  <cit> . several studies have reported that learning and motor activity influence oligodendrocytes and myelination in white and grey matter of the adult brain  <cit> . in particular, enriched environment increases myelin-forming oligodendrocytes, myelinated axons and white matter volume during brain aging  <cit> . furthermore, mckenzie et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that wheel running remarkably increases the proliferation and generation of oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum . these newly differentiated oligodendrocytes are necessary to learn complex running wheel.

previous studies have shown that oligodendrocyte precursor cells such as chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan expressing cells  react to learning and motor activity in the adult brain . a small fraction of proliferating ng2+ cells differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes  <cit> . in addition, previous studies demonstrated that ng2+ cells are able to express the neuronal marker doublecortin , a microtubulin-associated protein  <cit> . dcx is known as a key player in neuronal migration during development. oligodendrocyte precursor cells expressing ng <dig> are also known to be highly migratory cells in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . in the adult brain, a subpopulation of ng2+cells can also express dcx which is involved in microtubulin polymerization  <cit> . however, in which way reaching training and enriched environment influences generation of distinct oligodendrocyte subpopulations and whether ng2-cells respond in the adult cortex and corpus callosum, regions where oligodendrocytes are present, is still unclear.

the aim of the present study was:  to evaluate the effect of motor activity on generation and distribution of different oligodendrocytes subtypes in the grey and white matter of the adult rat brain and  to examine co-expression of dcx in ng2+ cells and to what extent rt and ee alter the differentiation of ng2+dcx+ subpopulations.

we wanted to test the hypothesis that specific reaching training is able to influence the differentiation of specific oligodendrocyte subpopulations in the grey and white matter, as compared to unspecific motor training by enriched environment.

RESULTS
effect of rt and motor training by ee on brain volume
on day  <dig>  analysis of global brain volume  revealed no differences between the  <dig> experimental groups . interestingly, brain volumes were significantly reduced in the standard group  as well as in the enriched group between day  <dig> and day  <dig> , whereas no loss of brain volume was found in the reaching group  at day  <dig> .fig.  <dig> 
a experimental design: three different groups of animals were housed under standard conditions in ordinary cages , in an enriched environment  containing various objects such as horizontal and vertical boards, climbing platform, plastic tubes and tunnels, chains, and small houses or kept in a standard cage and trained daily in a reaching task  of the dominant forelimb in a plexiglas chamber. animals had to grasp  <dig> food pellets in the first week, which was raised up to  <dig> pellets per day in the second week. all animals received single daily i.p. brdu injections from day  <dig> to day  <dig>  animals were transcardially perfused for further processing at day  <dig> or day  <dig> after the beginning of the experiments. b the graph represents the brain volume of different groups for  <dig>  to − <dig>  mm refered from bregma. bars represent mean ± sd. asterisks indicate significant differences 




ng2+ and gstπ+ expressing oligodendrocytes in the sensorimotor cortex
brdu+ cells were observed in all cortical layers without any laminar preference, in all experimental groups. ee significantly decreased the number of brdu+ cells in the sensorimotor cortex at day  <dig> compared to standard housing and rt. no differences were observed at day  <dig> .

in addition, proliferating ng2+ cells were quantified after ee and rt and compared to standard housing at day  <dig> and  <dig>  we found no change in the total number of ng2+ cells in either activity group, but newly differentiated ng2+ cells were significantly reduced after ee housing at day  <dig> compared to standard housing conditions . no effects were observed in the rt group .

furthermore, we analysed the influence of ee and rt on newly differentiated ng2+gstπ+ cells in the sensorimotor cortex. a small number of brdu+ng2+gstπ+ cells was observed in all cortical layers without any laminar preference in all experimental groups . 3d-reconstructions with laser scanning microscopy showed a high overlapping of ng <dig> and gstπ expression with brdu+ cells . both rt  and ee  housing transiently increased the number of brdu+ng2+gstπ+ oligodendrocytes at day  <dig> compared to the standard group . in addition, we found a motor activity-dependent increase in the number of newly differentiated ng2+gstπ+ oligodendrocyte precursor cells in the sensorimotor cortex at day  <dig>  interestingly, the percentage of brdu+ng2+gstπ+ cells was increased compared to standard housing at day  <dig> .fig.  <dig> activity-dependent increase of brdu+gstπ+ cells in the sensorimotor cortex at day  <dig>  a confocal images of triple-labelled sections with antibodies against brdu , ng <dig>  and gstπ . b single confocal planes by z-stack co-labelling of brdu+ with ng2+gstπ+. c graph depicting the total number of brdu+ng2+gstπ+ cells which increased after enriched environment housing and reaching training at 10 days compared to standard conditions. bars represent mean ± sd. asterisks indicate significant differences . scale bars represent a 100 µm and b 10 µm

in addition to the number of brdu+cnpase+ oligodendrocytes, the level of cnpase expression was measured in three different areas  at day  <dig> . ee  and rt  significantly increased cnpase expression in the frontal cortex  which mainly contains the motor cortex, compared to standard housing . no changes were observed at bregma anterior/posterior: + <dig>  and − <dig>  between the different groups.fig.  <dig>

quantification of newly differentiated ng <dig> and gstπ expressing oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum
after the analysis in the grey matter, we test whether motor activity influences oligodendrocyte precursor cells in the corpus callosum, using brdu co-labelling . almost half of all newly differentiated cells expressed ng2+ at day  <dig> after standard and ee housing. this ratio changed at day  <dig> as more than 40% of newly differentiated cells expressed only gstπ+ . the rt showed the same trend to a lower ratio of brdu+ng2+ cells at day  <dig>  and brdu+gstπ+ cells at day  <dig>  results for the corpus callosum show that the number of ng2+ cells declines between  <dig> and 42 days, whereas the number of gstπ+ cells increases in all groups.fig.  <dig> percentage of distinct oligodendrocyte precursor cells in the corpus callosum of the different experimental groups. a confocal overview image of triple-labelled sections with antibodies against brdu , gstπ  and ng <dig> . b single confocal planes by z-stack co-labeling of brdu+ with ng2+. c single confocal planes by z-stack co-labeling of brdu+ with gstπ+. d the schematic detailed picture below shows areas analysed  <cit> . e, f the distribution of the brdu+ cells between the different activity conditions at days  <dig>  and  <dig> . scale bars

quantification of ng2+cells expressing doublecortin  in the cerebral cortex
we determined whether ng2+ cells in the cerebral cortex express dcx. analysis with flow cytometry of freshly dissociated cerebral cortices of 3-month-old rats, confirmed that at least 61 ± 21% of ng2+ cells co-expressed dcx  using facs analysis. only a small fraction of dcx+ cells  was found to co-express ng <dig> 

these findings were further validated by immunofluorescence staining. co-labeling analysis of dcx expression in ng <dig> cells showed co-localization of dcx in ng <dig> cells with stellate morphologies in the cerebral cortex . quantitative analysis of histological sections showed that 79 ± 24% of ng2+ cells co-labelled with dcx+ in all cortical layers. in contrast, 25 ± 6% of the dcx+ cell population expressed ng <dig> . increased number of dcx+ cells co-expressing ng <dig> was detected with the manual counting after immunofluorescence staining. in addition to protein analysis, we evaluated specific expression of dcx in facs-sorted, ng2+ cells by means of qpcr . the mrna levels in ng2+ sorted cells and hippocampal dcx+ were similar. these results demonstrate expression of dcx in ng2+ cells. taken together, we show here that most of ng2+ cells co-express dcx in the cerebral cortex.

quantification of ng2+dcx+ cells after ee and rt in the sensorimotor cortex
we analyzed the effect of motor activity on brdu+ng2+dcx+ cells in the sensorimotor cortex. newly differentiated ng2+dcx+ cells were found in all cortical layers without any preference . furthermore, this progenitor subpopulation was significantly reduced by enriched environment housing  compared to standard housing conditions  at day  <dig>  whereas specific training of the dominant forelimb  had no significant effect . at day  <dig>  these there were no differences anymore . in addition, not all cells expressed both markers; there were some dcx+ cells lacking ng <dig> and ng2+cells lacking dcx . ng2+/dcx+ expressing cells were co-labelled for platelet-derived growth factor-alpha receptor  and were identified as oligodendrocyte precursor cells .fig.  <dig> immunocytochemical quantification of newly differentiated ng2+dcx+ subpopulation in the sensorimotor cortex of the different experimental groups. a overview of proliferating brdu+  ng2+  dcx+  cells at day  <dig> of the experiment. b confocal images of triple-labelled sections with antibodies against brdu  ng <dig>  dcx  in the sensorimotor cortex. c quantification of brdu+ng2+dcx+ cells in the different experimental groups at days  <dig> and  <dig>  d confocal images of quadruple-labelled sections with antibodies against ng <dig> , dcx , pdgfαr  and dapi . ng2+/dcx+ cells co-labelled with an antibody against the pdgfα receptor in the adult cerebral cortex. error bars represent s.d. significant differences  are indicated by an asterisk. scale bars

discussion
the aim of the present study was to analyse the effect of two different motor activity conditions, reaching training  and enriched environment , on differentiation of oligodendrocytes in the sensorimotor cortex and corpus callosum of the adult rat brain. we provide novel data showing that ee and rt act differently on the differentiation process of oligodendrocyte subpopulations in the cerebral cortex and corpus callosum of the rat.

ee and rt increase the number of newly differentiated oligodendrocytes in the sensorimotor cortex
in accordance with previous studies  <cit> , our findings demonstrate that oligodendrocyte precursors expressing ng <dig> are the dominant proliferating population in the neocortex of the adult brain. under standard conditions, in the sensorimotor cortex 79 – 89% of all ng2+ cells were newly differentiated ng2+ cells, whereas this number was significantly reduced by ee. while brdu+ng2+ cells decreased in the sensorimotor cortex of the enriched group, brdu+ng2+gstπ+ and brdu+cnpase+ oligodendrocyte numbers were increased. these findings are in agreement with a previous study by simon et al.  <cit> , which described a reduced differentiation of brdu+ng2+ cells and a strong increase in the number of brdu+gstπ+ oligodendrocytes in the grey matter after voluntary wheel running. analysis of proliferation markers ki <dig> and brdu  <cit>  indicates that reduction of brdu+ng2+ cell numbers depends on its increased exit from the cell cycle. this, in turn leads to a faster differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes  <cit> . our study provides evidence that ee but not rt reduces the number of brdu+ng2+ cells. the differential effect of ee and rt on brdu+ng2+ cells is possibly associated with different settings of housing and training conditions , the specification of motor activity and learning to the sensorimotor cortex  or direct alterations to the cell . furthermore, rt increases the number of oligodendrocyte precursors expressing brdu+ng2+gstπ+ and also the number of cnpase+ oligodendrocytes. in support of our findings, a previous study by wurm et al.  <cit>  showed a significant increase of newly generated neurons in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus formation after reaching training, suggesting that reaching training directly influences learning and memory. taken together these results demonstrate that experiences such as enriched housing, reaching training and wheel running, increase newly differentiated oligodendrocytes in the grey matter. interestingly, findings from our study are in disagreement with a previous analysis by ehninger and kempermann  <cit>  on the effects of enriched environment and voluntary wheel running on basal cell proliferation in the cortex. the study showed a regional and laminar specific regulation of brdu+ cells and described a voluntary wheel running-specific increase of newly generated microglia in the motor cortex, whereas enriched environment housing did not show any particular effects. in addition, they could not detect any motor activity-dependent changes in the number of newly differentiated ng2+ cells in the different layers. this discrepancy to our findings might be explained by differences in methodology, since ehninger and kempermann  <cit>  used a different experimental design involving brdu application after 30 days of environmental enrichment housing. our findings clearly demonstrate that motor activity for 10 days increases the total number of newly differentiated oligodendrocytes  and cnpase+ cells at day  <dig> in the sensorimotor cortex. xiao et al.  <cit>  analysed oligodendrocyte differentiation directly after exposure to a complex running wheel. using in situ hybridization to determine enpp <dig> mrna levels, they analysed early time points after motor skill learning. after complex wheel running, expression of enpp- <dig> in immature oligodendrocytes was increased in the subcortical white matter within just  <dig>  h and in the motor cortex after 4 h. the block of enpp- <dig> by myelin regulatory factor  deletion in immature oligodendrocytes impaired motor skill learning in the complex wheel running. these results clearly demonstrate that oligodendrocytes already contribute to learning in early stages of their development. oligodendrocytes are highly connected to the axons and their metabolism. the development of oligodendrocytes and myelination is regulated by the activity of the axons. increasing myelination improves the network connectivity at the synaptic level, which could contribute to facilitated learning conditions. enriched environment housing not only influences the generation of ng2+ cells under physiological conditions but also after stroke in remote areas of cortical regions  <cit> , suggesting that ee has a high impact on ng2+cells.

the present study also showed a motor activity-dependent increase in the expression of cnpase in the adult sensorimotor cortex. our findings are in agreement with early studies analysing the glial response to enriched environment in the occipital cortex  <cit> . in particular, using thionin staining, diamond et al.  <cit>  found no differences in the number of neurons but a prominent increase in the number of oligodendrocytes as well as astrocytes after 80 days of enriched housing. szeligo and leblond  <cit>  and katz and davies  <cit>  confirmed the activity-induced increase in the number of oligodendrocytes in the occipital cortex after  <dig> or 80 days enriched environment housing. based on their results, these authors suggested that the overall sensory motor stimulation influences the activity of neurons in the occipital cortex leading to an increase of the number of oligodendrocytes. in addition, rats reared in a complex enriched environment showed significantly more oligodendrocytes in the visual cortex  <cit> . interestingly, social isolation of young mice  decreases the number of oligodendrocytes in the prefrontal cortex  <cit> , further supporting previous findings.

we hereby additionally demonstrate that cnpase expression in the sensorimotor cortex responds to external stimulation such as ee and rt. therefore, we suggest that cnpase expression in oligodendrocytes might contribute to the activity-dependent remodelling of synaptic connections in the adult cortex.

the percentage distribution of different oligodendrocyte subtypes is not changed by motor activity in the corpus callosum
the distribution of distinct oligodendrocyte subtypes was analysed in the corpus callosum at day  <dig> and day  <dig>  we found a strong decrease in the percentage of proliferating ng2+ cells between day  <dig> and day  <dig>  this was observed in all groups and reflects the differentiation of ng2+ cells. sampaio-baptista and colleagues  <cit>  showed an increase of mature oligodendrocytes analysed by mbp expression after reaching training. they further found a positive correlation between learning rate and diffusion mri fractional anisotropy  in the contralateral hemisphere of the trained paw. interestingly, human motor learning and training such as those undertaken by professional musicians modify the white matter showing an enlarged anterior corpus callosum compared to controls  <cit> . scholz et al.  <cit>  analysed the effect of 6 weeks of juggling training on adult human white matter and detected a significant increase of diffusion mri fractional anisotropy in the right posterior intraparietal sulcus for a period of at least 4 weeks when compared to controls.

enriched environment decreases the number of dcx-expressing ng <dig> cells in the sensorimotor cortex
our analysis concentrated on a subpopulation of ng2+ cells expressing dcx in the adult rat sensorimotor cortex. here, using immunohistochemistry and flow-cytometry-based analysis we detected a high fraction of ng2+dcx+ cells in the cerebral cortex. numbers of cells as determined by flow cytometry were higher compared with numbers from immunohistochemical analysis. the difference in the number of cells between both methods is possibly due to higher sensitivity of flow cytometry-based analyses compared with in situ staining methods. dcx has been identified as a micotubule-associated protein important for neuroblast migration in the developing and adult brain. at this stage, dcx is involved in microtubulin stabilization, nuclear translocation and growth cone dynamics  <cit> . interestingly, hughes et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that ng2+ cells migrate continuously through the adult cortex. to what extent dcx expression in ng2+ cells is necessary for ng <dig> motility is still unclear and needs to be further investigated. in contrast to the findings for ng2+ cells, the number of dcx+ cells expressing ng <dig> is rather low. expression of other glial markers such as gfap in dcx+ cells has already been described for humans, primates and mice  <cit> . next, we analysed to what extent enriched environment and skilled reaching training influenced newly differentiated ng2+dcx+ cells in the sensorimotor cortex. interestingly, ee decreased the subpopulation of ng2+dcx+ cells. in support of our findings, several studies described the co-expression of ng <dig> and dcx in the adult brain  <cit> . ehninger et al.  <cit>  detected a large fraction of brdu+ng2+dcx+ cells 1 day and 4 weeks after the last brdu injection in the adult amygdala. guo et al.  <cit>  reported that the adult piriform cortex contains a high number of dcx-expressing cells with different dcx expression levels, which was additionally described by walker et al.  <cit> . our results demonstrate that unspecific training like ee differentially influences newly differentiating ng2+dcx+ subpopulation compared to specific forelimb training. the possible mechanisms underlying the effect of ee on the number of ng2+dcx+ cells in the sensorimotor cortex are still not clear.

in the present study we detected a reduction in brain volume restricted to bregma  <dig> – <dig>  mm after enriched environment and standard housing conditions compared to reaching training. these results give some evidence that ee and rt differentially influence the brain volume, which was previously described using motor map expression  <cit> . to validate these findings more sensitive methods such as mrt must be used to get insights into changes in the whole brain volume due to experience.

possible mechanisms and functional consequences
the present study provides evidence that enriched environment and skilled reaching training can regulate oligodendrocyte differentiation in the sensorimotor cortex. previous studies have shown that activity, such as running or individual learning of sensorimotor skills, can induce the generation of oligodendrocytes. possible mechanisms involved in increased oligodendrocyte genesis might include altered cell cycle dynamics, modulation of growth factors or increasing axon stimulation by neuronal activity  <cit> . the mechanisms responsible for the increased number of oligodendrocytes in the sensorimotor cortex after enriched environment housing and skilled reaching training, are totally unclear and need further investigations. the pivotal role of oligodendrocytes in the adult cortex is the myelination of axons within the neuronal network. myelinating oligodendrocytes thereby control the speed of impulse conduction within these networks and adjust the synchrony of impulse traffic between distant cortical regions. increased activity of the neural circuit might stimulate myelination of the axons and make the network more efficient. the functional relevance of newly differentiating oligodendrocytes has already been shown by mckenzie et al.  <cit>  and xiao et al.  <cit> . both studies showed that in mice, differentiation of new oligodendrocytes is indispensable to learn the complex wheel paradigm. it is very likely that these new oligodendrocytes contribute to the activity-dependent remodelling of synaptic connections in the adult cortex.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, the present study clearly demonstrates that two different types of motor activities, such as specific motor skill training and unspecific training in an enriched environment, differentially influence the differentiation of specific oligodendrocyte subpopulations in the adult sensorimotor cortex.
