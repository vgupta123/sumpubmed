BACKGROUND
melon  is a highly diversified species that is cultivated worldwide, with more than  <dig> million tons produced in  <dig> . it is a eudicot diploid species  that belongs to the cucurbitaceae family which includes other important vegetable crops such as cucumber, watermelon and squash. in recent years melon has become a model system for studying important biological processes as plant sex determination  <cit> , phloem transport  <cit> , and fruit ripening  <cit> . at the same time, several genetic and genomic tools are available in melon, such as saturated genetic maps  <cit>  or est databases  <cit> .

the advent of high throughput next generation sequencing  technologies combined with declining cost has led to an explosion in the number of sequenced plant genomes in the past several years  <cit> . the majority have used a whole genome shotgun  strategy and a hybrid approach to genome assembly, incorporating both short reads typically generated by ngs platforms, and sanger-derived end sequences from large insert bac and fosmid clones  <cit> . the genome of melon was recently sequenced, producing a genome assembly with n <dig> scaffold size of  <dig>  mb and n <dig> index of  <dig>  of good quality when compared with other plant genomes recently reported based on ngs  <cit> . the quality of the genome assembly has an impact on applications of the genome sequence by providing, among others, a reference genome for resequencing analysis. comparisons of resequenced individuals to a reference genome offer a means to identify and characterize genetic polymorphisms, of which single nucleotide polymorphisms  are the most important and abundant. snp discovery using ngs approaches has been reported in many crop species  <cit> , and it has been described that snps identified through whole genome resequencing have a low false discovery rate compared to other methods  <cit> . the abundance of snps in the genome, coupled with the diversity of technologies for performing multiplex assays that can range from genotyping single snps at a time to over one million in parallel  <cit> , make them a powerful tool for genetic mapping and marker assisted breeding.

the assembly of genomic scaffolds to generate chromosome-scale sequences, or pseudomolecules , is done by integrating them with genetic or physical maps  <cit> . a genetic map of sufficient accuracy and marker density is therefore essential for anchoring genomic scaffolds to linkage maps. high density genetic maps developed with single sequence repeat  and snp markers have been used in many crop species to anchor genome assemblies. recent examples include peach   <cit> , diploid strawberry   <cit>  and apple   <cit>  as well species of the cucurbitaceae family such as watermelon   <cit> , and cucumber   <cit> . a set of  <dig> polymorphic snps, derived from a c. melo expressed sequence tag  collection  <cit>  were used to produce a high resolution genetic map based on  <dig> doubled haploid lines  of the cross “piel de sapo”   x songwhan charmi’   to anchor and orient  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of the melon scaffold genome assembly v <dig> , respectively  <cit> .

karyotype analysis in cucumis is difficult due to the small size and poor stainability of chromosomes  <cit> . despite this, karyotypes based on chromosome banding and morphology have been developed for several melon types with varying results  <cit> . fluorescence in situ hybridization  allows direct mapping of both single-copy and repetitive dna sequences on chromosomes, and is a more robust and reliable method of identifying chromosomes and establishing an accurate karyotype. fish is an important tool not only in cytogenetics, but also in genomic applications to estimate the size and positions of gaps in genome assemblies following sequencing, and in characterizing regions of recombination suppression where the resolution of genetic linkage maps are insufficient  <cit> . probes commonly used in fish karyotyping in plant species are the 45s and 5s rrna genes, tandemly repeated sequences near telomeres, centromere-specific repeats, and large insert dna clones such as bacterial artificial chromosomes , yeast artificial chromosomes , and fosmids  <cit> . extensive cytogenetic studies have been conducted using fish with these probes in cucumber, including the development of integrated molecular cytogenetic maps  <cit> . relatively less has been done in melon, but several studies using fish with 45s, 5s, and centromere specific probes have been performed to develop karyotypes  <cit> . cross species fish, based on sequence similarity of probes between closely related species, has been used with cucumber fosmids to make inferences on melon chromosome structure and karyotype  <cit> . however, in some instances, fosmids mapped to several non-target melon chromosomes, or failed to map. thus, the importance of fish in genomic applications, and non-target specific hybridization using cross-species fish in melon, highlights the need for an efficient fish methodology using melon specific large insert dna probes.

although the percentage of assembly effectively anchored to chromosomes of the melon genome described in  <cit>  was of a comparable level to some recently sequenced crop species  <cit> , insufficient marker coverage in the genetic map left several large, gene-rich scaffolds unanchored. also, due to the small population size and insufficient recombination, many anchored scaffolds contained just one mapped marker, or contained multiple tightly linked markers whose map order was undefined, which made orientation of some scaffolds impossible. to address these deficiencies, we detail the use of resequencing data between of ps and sc to develop a new, better distributed set of snp markers, and in combination with a larger segregating population, a high-density genetic map to augment the amount of anchored and oriented melon genome scaffolds. also, we describe the construction of more complete pms required to accurately represent the scaffold genome assembly. we also describe the use of bac probes to identify the  <dig> melon chromosomes and in combination with two color fish, orient them with respect to the genetic map and pms. this is an important first step in developing an integrated molecular cytogenetic map which will be a key tool in improving the quality of the draft genome of melon for future uses.

RESULTS
snp validation and construction of the genetic map
melon genome assembly v <dig>  is composed of  <dig>  scaffolds, of which  <dig> were previously anchored to the genetic map, representing  <dig> % of the scaffold assembly  <cit> . as  <dig> % of the scaffold assembly is contained in the  <dig> largest scaffolds  and snps between ps and sc lines are available  <cit> , we mined snps from  <dig> of the  <dig> scaffolds to construct a new genetic map in an f <dig> population derived from the ps x sc cross. the scaffolds ranged in size from  <dig>  mb  to  <dig>  kb . three scaffolds  were excluded due to the inability to extract high-quality snps from the genome sequence.  <dig> snps were selected for the design of a goldengate assay,  <dig> snps from unanchored scaffolds  and  <dig> snps from already anchored scaffolds  . overall, 599/ <dig>  of snps were successfully genotyped in the f <dig> population. of the  <dig> new snps comprising sub-set one,  <dig>  were validated. the remaining  <dig> snps from this set either failed to amplify, presented fused or extra clusters , or were false snps. the average designability rank score for failed snps  was markedly lower compared to that for successful snps . fifty percent of failed snps  were designed from the  <dig> smallest scaffolds that had a mean size of  <dig> kb. therefore, snps that were designed to just 1/ <dig> of the  <dig> scaffolds originally selected for re-anchoring the scaffold genome assembly accounted for half of the failure rate. the success rate for the second, previously validated sub-set of snps was much higher, with  <dig> of  <dig>  functioning. the successful snps from the two sub-sets were combined into a single set of  <dig> snps that was entered into joinmap for construction of the genetic map. nineteen snps were excluded from the mapping process due to extreme segregation distortion, missing data, or implausible fit in a linkage group . following this step, a core set of  <dig> snps  and  <dig> ps x sc f <dig> lines were used to construct a high resolution genetic map spanning  <dig>  cm of the  <dig> melon lgs with a mean of  <dig> snps per lg . the size of lgs ranged from  <dig>  cm  to  <dig>  cm  with the number of snps per lg ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  average spacing of markers genome-wide was  <dig>  cm/snp.figure  <dig>

in constructing the genetic linkage map, major areas of segregation distortion  were evident on lgs i and iv spanning  <dig>  and  <dig> cm, respectively . in both cases, marker alleles were skewed toward the sc parent. segregation distortion was reported previously in dhl and f <dig> mapping populations of melon derived from the ps x sc cross  <cit>  but did not correspond to the regions detected in this study. conversely, segregation distortion was not detected in backcross populations used for nil development  <cit> .

genome re-anchoring
the genetic map was used to perform a re-anchoring of the scaffold genome assembly to the  <dig> lgs . by anchoring the genetic map, six chimeric scaffolds , each mapping in two different locations in the genome  were detected . these were due to single misassemblies within scaffolds where paired-end links between contig sequences were erroneously joined during the genome assembly. after splitting, newly created scaffolds were designated as cm <dig> .1_scaffold01600- <dig>  additionally, a misassembly was identified in cm <dig> _scaffold <dig>  cm <dig> _scaffold <dig> was first detected as chimeric in assembly v <dig> , and split into cm <dig> _scaffold <dig> for v <dig>   <cit> . as the split was likely not performed properly,  <dig>  kb was trimmed from the latter and appended to the former. the melon genome assembly was updated to v <dig> . <dig>  identical to v <dig>  except for the above modifications and a slightly decreased final size of the assembled genome .

each of  <dig> scaffolds , containing over  <dig>  mb, or  <dig> % of the scaffold genome assembly, was anchored to the genetic map with a minimum of  <dig> and a maximum of  <dig> snps  the number of scaffolds anchored per lg ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  with a size ranging from  <dig>  mb to  <dig> kb. the size of newly anchored scaffolds ranged from  <dig>  mb  to  <dig>  kb  with an average size of approximately  <dig> kb. we were able to anchor  <dig> scaffolds with  <dig> or more snps and thus determine orientation for over  <dig> mb  of the scaffold assembly. forty-two scaffolds, totaling  <dig>  mb, remained unoriented . furthermore, the ordering of  <dig> of the unoriented scaffolds, located on six pms  was uncertain. most of these were less than  <dig> mb in size and were anchored in recombination suppression regions . although the average marker spacing was  <dig> kb/snp, large gaps were present on the physical map; e.g.  <dig>  mb in cm <dig> .1_scaffold <dig> on lgxii between cmsnp <dig> and cmpsnp <dig> and a  <dig>  mb gap in cm <dig> .1_scaffold <dig> on lgi between cmpsnp1111ce <dig> and cmpsnp <dig>  we failed to anchor  <dig> scaffolds targeted from assembly v <dig>  containing  <dig>  mb of sequence ranging in size from 410– <dig> kb with at least  <dig> snp marker . anchored scaffolds were assembled into  <dig> pms according to the nomenclature and established orientation of the melon lgs of the consensus linkage map  <cit> . these were supplemented by a virtual chromosome  <dig> containing  <dig>  mb of sequence. the pms ranged in size from  <dig>   to  <dig>   mb and the number of newly anchored scaffolds ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  per pm .figure  <dig>

the genome-wide recombination rate  calculated for the melon genome was  <dig>  cm/mb. the recombination rates among pms varied widely from a minimum of  <dig>  cm/mb on lgiv, to  <dig>  cm/mb on lgix  and, with the exception of pmx, was correlated to physical size, with the shortest chromosomes exhibiting higher recombination rates, and vice versa. the ratio between genetic and physical distances localized regions of high recombination mostly concentrated around the ends of the pms, with recombination suppression increasing as distance from the ends increased . an exception was pmx, which showed high recombination only on one end of the chromosome, and a large zone of recombination suppression extending for approximately  <dig> mb to the opposite end. recombination rates within chromosomes also varied widely, reflective of the size and distribution of zones. blast analysis with four distinct centromere specific repeats: ssat <dig> and centspa, b, c as well as repeats specific to the nucleolus organizer region  or 45s rdna and 5s rdna sites, corresponded with zones of recombination suppression .

karyotype of ps
nineteen single copy bacs were used to identify the  <dig> metaphase chromosomes of melon designated cme 1– <dig> . chromosomes were then assigned to their corresponding lgs according to the map positions of  <dig> genetic markers  contained in these bacs. seven chromosomes  were labeled with  <dig> bac probes located in ends of each chromosome, allowing the identification of the short  and long  arms, and orientation of chromosomes . single bacs were hybridized to the long arms of cme  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> and to the short arm of cme  <dig>  the designation for cme  <dig> was uncertain. chromosomes were categorized morphologically as metacentric , sub-metacentric  or acrocentric  and a standardized melon karyotype constructed . the relative sizes of chromosomes was visible in the karyotype, with cme  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> being the smallest and most compact, while cme  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were among the largest. the structure of pms corresponded to the morphology of cme  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . centromere positions indicated by psat <dig> and centsp sequences correlated well to zones of recombination suppression visible in the karyotype, and to the presence of many, relatively small scaffolds on the physical map. a large constriction was evident on cme <dig> . fish mapping of bac clones on chromosomes confirmed the correct positioning of genomic scaffolds within pms as the hybridization signals were located on the extremes of chromosome arms, as predicted by their anchoring to the genetic map .table  <dig>

discussion
the resequencing of ps and sc, the parents of the dhl <dig> melon reference genome, identified  <dig>  million putative snps occurring with a frequency of one per  <dig> bp  <cit> . we took advantage of this resource to identify a new set of  <dig> polymorphic snps between ps and sc to develop a high-resolution genetic map and anchor  <dig>  mb of sequence contained in  <dig> scaffolds, representing  <dig> % of the ~ <dig> mb melon scaffold genome assembly v <dig> . <dig> . we oriented  <dig>  mb of sequence, representing  <dig> % of the assembly.

the quantity of anchored, and especially oriented, genome was comparable to other recently sequenced crop plants  <cit>   and highest among sequenced cucurbit species  <cit> . it also represented a significant improvement from the anchoring of assembly v <dig>   <cit> . as snps used to construct the genetic map and anchor assembly v <dig>  were selected at random from a collection of melon ests, their chromosomal location in the assembly was unknown  <cit> . furthermore, snps derived from ests have a high false discovery rate compared to other sources as previously described in  <cit> . therefore, marker coverage of the genome was likely incomplete because some scaffolds were either not represented by ests and subsequently, snps; the snps failed because they were false; or they failed to be validated for various other reasons as was seen in this study  and previously  <cit> . an additional problem was that snp selection was biased to larger scaffolds, as none smaller than  <dig> kb were anchored in v <dig> . we addressed these deficiencies and achieved a high level of anchoring first, by utilizing the resequencing data and the snp calling pipeline, combined with an “inverse mapping” strategy of planned genetic map construction. as opposed to creating a genetic map at random, the inverse mapping strategy consisted of targeted snp selection using data from the melon genome a priori to identify  <dig> of  <dig> largest scaffolds comprising the n <dig> index  and focusing snp discovery to these scaffolds. this permitted snp development for large and smaller scaffolds equally well. second, to maximize the probability of orientation, multiple snps were chosen at the extremes of targeted scaffolds for the goldengate genotyping assay to maximize the physical distances between them. this strategy was combined with a doubling of the mapping population size to  <dig> f <dig> individuals to increase the probability of recombination, and subsequent orientation of the genomic scaffolds in the relation to the genetic map. in this way, both large, gene rich scaffolds  which accounted for most of the newly anchored sequence, as well as many smaller scaffolds less than  <dig> mb in size could be anchored and oriented . a similar strategy of employing resequencing data for snp discovery combined with a larger population was used to improve the anchoring and orientation of the soybean genome  <cit> . one disadvantage to choosing markers principally from the extremes of scaffolds was uneven marker distribution, and the presence of several large physical gaps between snps, e.g. on lgi and lgxii. this drawback was balanced by the precision of snp selection and effectiveness of the genome anchoring and orientation using the inverse mapping approach, and should be an effective strategy for anchoring other plant genomes given the availability of a high quality reference genome and resequencing data from parental lines.

we constructed pms of scaffold genome assembly v <dig> . <dig> corresponding to the  <dig> melon chromosomes that were significantly more complete than v <dig> , incorporating an additional  <dig>  mb of anchored sequence representing  <dig>  predicted genes contained in  <dig> scaffolds. an additional  <dig>  mb of sequence was newly oriented. compared to assembly v <dig> , the  <dig> pms were augmented by a mean of  <dig>  mb, and a maximum of  <dig>  mb in the case of lgx, together representing  <dig>   of the predicted  <dig>  melon genes. the quality of the anchoring of scaffold genome assembly v <dig> . <dig>  and subsequent construction of pm builds was verified by comparing it to assembly v <dig>   <cit> . the scaffold order was almost completely conserved, with some exceptions being inversions of adjacent scaffolds on pm ix  and pm xi  and changes in the orientation of others. the anchoring of the  <dig> new scaffolds to their corresponding lgs, and their ordering within pms, was also largely verified with data from another melon genetic map . this provided a further independent measure of the quality and accuracy of the anchoring of assembly v <dig> . <dig>  for example, by confirming the new position of cm <dig> .1_scaffold <dig> on lgvi. lastly, by adding markers to regions of scaffolds that were previously without them, the new genetic map helped to verify the integrity of existing scaffold builds, as well as improving the quality of the assembly through the identification of six mis-assemblies and correction in the size of two others .

while pseudomolecule build v  <dig> . <dig> was significantly more complete compared to v  <dig> , approximately  <dig>  mb of sequence contained in  <dig>  scaffolds ranging from 2– <dig> kb in size and containing  <dig> genes remained unanchored. despite this, expending the effort to anchor smaller scaffolds beyond those in the n <dig> index would have been prohibitive compared to the benefit . another feature of the new pm build was uncertainty in order and orientation of many mostly small scaffolds, principally in large zones of recombination suppression on lgiv, vi, and x. recombination suppression zones are usually heterochromatic and gene poor, typically containing a high percentage of repeat sequences  <cit> . to anchor remaining scaffolds, and resolve uncertainties in order and position, above all, in zones of recombination will require the development of a fish protocol on meiotic chromosomes. this will facilitate the comparison between the molecular and cytogenetic map as has been performed in cucumber  <cit> , but only partially in melon  <cit> . in spite of these drawbacks, pm builds of v <dig> . <dig> will be indispensable as a more complete reference sequence for comparative mapping and syntenic studies among cucurbits  <cit> , for downstream applications such as genotyping by sequencing   <cit> , and for optical mapping that has been performed in other species to improve draft genome quality  <cit> . the links established by a more comprehensive anchoring of the melon genome sequence and the genetic map developed here and elsewhere  <cit>  will be vital in moving from quantitative trait loci  for important traits, to cloning of the underlying genes.

the karyotype of the commercially important ‘piel de sapo’ spanish type melon was 2n = 2x = 24 = 16sm + 6ac + 2m . this was distinct from what has been reported in other types including muskmelon   <cit> ; american muskmelon  and ‘hetian’  as 2n = 2x = 24 = 20m + 4sm and 2n = 2x = 24 = 22m + 2sm, respectively  <cit> ; and two other c. melo types, ‘jiashi’ thick skin and ‘huangjin’ thin skin type   <cit> . the difference in karyotype may reflect a fundamental difference in the chromosome morphology due to changes in centromere position within the inodorus group, or misinterpretation associated with the difficulty of establishing a karyotype with small chromosomes and the lack of a landmark  to clearly demarcate centromeres. one feature of the ps karyotype was similar to those of other studies, namely the presence of a satellite produced by a secondary constriction in the pericentromeric region on the short arm of cme <dig>  <cit> . large insert dna clones, in this case bacs, were used for the first time as reliable cytogenetic landmarks to identify the  <dig> melon chromosomes and in combination with two-color fish, orient them with respect to the genetic map and pms . although probes for the 45s and 5s genes and centromere specific repeats were not mapped by fish to melon chromosomes as in other karyotyping studies  <cit> , their positions were inferred after in silico analysis. centsp repetitive sequences, a family of satellite dnas tandemly arranged in large arrays that are the primary components of the centromeres  <cit>  were located in large zones of reduced recombination and high snp marker density . this indicated that, lacking fish probes for these features, their in silico positioning was a good approximation. this work represents the first steps towards the integration of the high-resolution genetic and cytogenetic map with the genomic sequence in melon and provides more information on genome organization.

although both the number of snps obtained and genotyping efficiency can be improved by using an ngs-based genotyping alternative such as gbs  <cit> , we chose the illumina goldengate system in v <dig> . <dig> in order to re-use some of the snps and thus have common anchoring points with the previous version v <dig>   <cit> . utilizing this system and resequencing data from ps and sc lines, 66%  of newly designed snps called with the simply unified pair-end resequencing  pipeline  <cit>  were validated , adding to the more than  <dig>  snp markers validated in the ps x sc population to date . the ps line represents the predominant and most economically important melon type grown in spain and is a parental line in dhl, nil, and other f <dig> mapping populations  <cit>  used to identify qtl for an extensive variety of fruit quality and disease resistance traits  <cit> . thus, the additional snp markers developed here will add to the genotyping resources available for the mapping populations in the same genetic background  <cit>  and facilitate fine mapping and cloning of qtl currently under development  <cit> . furthermore, despite the fact that newly designed snps were selected to be polymorphic between ps and sc, a high percentage can be expected to function in other accessions and outside of the inodorus group, as was found for other snps developed for the ps x sc cross described in esteras et al.  <cit> . the failure rate of snps in the goldengate assay was higher than in previous studies with melon where validation rates varied between  <dig> and 91%  <cit> . there was a high correlation between snp failure and the corresponding size of the unanchored scaffold for which they were designed, illustrating the difficulty of anchoring small scaffolds with highly repetitive sequence, using diminished snp calling parameters.

understanding recombination landscape within a species is important for plant breeding applications. a detailed genome-wide and local depiction of recombination rates allows for accurate scaling of map-based cloning projects, marker assisted selection  strategies for trait introgression, and crossing programs where unfavorable linkage between traits needs to be broken, since regions with high or low recombination rates require correspondingly higher or lower marker densities. at a finer scale, understanding recombination in crop species can help to define recombinationally hyperactive regions or individual genes controlling recombination rate  <cit>  as well as understanding plant genome variability  <cit> . the genome wide recombination rate calculated in this study  for melon was higher than previous   <cit>  primarily reflecting the increased quantity of anchored genomic sequence and correspondingly larger genetic map distances. it was within the range of other cucurbit species,  <dig>  cm/mb and  <dig>  cm/mb for watermelon and cucumber, respectively  <cit> . the recombination rate between chromosomes varied widely, reflecting the size and distribution of recombination suppression zones . for example, positioning of repetitive sequences by blast analysis supported the idea that zones of recombination suppression covering large physical distances corresponded to some components of the nor on lgiv  and lgx  as well as the 5s rdna on lgxii , as has been reported  <cit> . furthermore, we detected components of nor on lgi , which has not previously been reported. han et al.  <cit>  detected a large, heterochromatic segment in the pericentromeric region of the long arm of melon chromosome i that accounted for approximately 47% of its length, which may correspond to this zone. overall, the differences in recombination rates between chromosomes, and the collocation of recombination suppression zones with the genomic scaffolds identified here will aid in the planning for mas projects and development of mapping populations in melon. for example, it would be necessary to increase the population size to increase the possibilities of obtaining recombinant individuals on lgiv and lgx.

CONCLUSIONS
we provided a significantly improved version of the anchored melon genome by developing a new set of targeted snp markers with better distribution to construct a high-resolution genetic map. the improved anchoring of the melon genome will permit faster map-based cloning of genes underlying qtl for agronomically important traits, diversity assessment through comparative genomics, and provide important insights on phylogenetic relationships among cucurbits. with the improved anchoring, it was possible to make in silico inferences on likely chromosome structure by relating zones of recombination suppression to centromeres and 45s and 5s heterochromatic regions. the fish mapping with the melon specific bac probes allowed us to orient the  <dig> melon chromosomes and develop a karyotype. this represents the first steps towards the integration of the high-resolution genetic and cytogenetic map with the genomic sequence in melon that will provide more information on genome organization and allow for the improvement of the melon genome draft sequence.
