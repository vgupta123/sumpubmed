BACKGROUND
a universally conserved adaptation to drought stress observed in plants is an adjustment of the biosynthesis and metabolism of various phytohormones  <cit> . abscisic acid  is the most important hormone involved in the resistance of plants to drought and other abiotic stresses  <cit> . due to the potential applications of aba for improving the stress tolerance of cultivated plants in the field, the mechanisms underlying aba signal transduction, especially aba perception, have been studied extensively for the past two decades  <cit> . although chloroplast membrane-localized mg-chelatase h subunit /putative aba receptor   <cit>  and plasma membrane-localized gpcr-type g proteins   <cit>  were previously reported to be aba receptors, it has remained unclear how they modulate plant responses to aba. a breakthrough occurred in  <dig>  when at least two independent groups identified and characterized the pyrabactin resistance 1/pyr1-like /regulatory components of aba receptors  protein family as soluble aba receptors . since then, a new model for aba action has been proposed and validated. in this model, pyr/pyl/rcar aba receptors function at the apex of a negative regulatory pathway to directly regulate group a type 2c protein phosphatases , which in turn directly regulate subclass iii plant-specific sucrose nonfermenting 1-related subfamily  <dig>  protein kinases . these three effector families constitute the core components of the signaling pathway, and their members have been shown to mediate several aba-controlled plant physiological processes, such as seed germination and dormancy, fruit maturation, seedling growth, stomatal movement and stress-related gene expression . moreover, these core signaling components are well conserved among higher plants, indicating that the establishment of the core aba signaling pathway had a great impact on the colonization of land, especially with regard to drought tolerance .

research on aba signal transduction has flourished since the identification and characterization of the core signaling components. however, many such investigations have been focused on aboveground tissues, whereas the function of aba in root-related processes is poorly understood. it is well known that aba has a distinct effect on aboveground leaves and belowground roots, especially under drought conditions, whereby aba inhibits shoot growth and water release while enhancing root growth and water uptake  <cit> . there is obvious redundancy in the modulation of seed germination, stomatal aperture and transcriptional responses to aba in vegetative tissues by pyr1/pyl/rcar aba receptor genes  <cit> . antoni et al.  <cit>  recently found that the single knockout of pyl <dig> resulted in reduced sensitivity to the aba-mediated inhibition of root growth, and zhao et al.  <cit>  further demonstrated that pyl <dig> promotes lateral root growth independent of the core aba-snrk <dig> signaling pathway. these genetic results suggest the existence of different aba functions corresponding to specific signaling mechanisms or that distinct preferences for components of the pyr1/pyl/rcar signaling pathway exist between leaves and roots.

in addition to the organ specificity of aba, it has been shown that aba signaling is related to different types of stress, such as dehydration vs. cold stress  <cit> , as well as the duration of stress experienced by plants  <cit>  and plant water conditions  <cit> . nonetheless, the environment-dependent organ-specific sensitivity of the core signaling components remains poorly understood. based on previous work characterizing the maize effectors zmpyl  <cit> , zmpp2cs  <cit>  and zmsnrk2s , in the present study, contrasting transcriptional responses of aba core signaling components to aba, peg  or dehydration stress were studied in a time-course analysis in both roots and leaves. our objective was to explore the relationship between aba functions and signal transduction, with a particular emphasis on the plasticity of the pyr1/pyl/rcar-pp2c-snrk <dig> signaling pathway in response to various abiotic stresses and the stress intensities that fine-tune the actions of aba in various organs.

genes encoding aba receptors of arabidopsis thaliana were used as query to identify the orthologous proteins from zea mays l. amino acid  length and gene locus are listed



the maize genes eu <dig>  and eu <dig> , identified by alexandrov et al.  <cit> , were described as aba-insensitive  subfamily pp2cs and designated zmabi <dig> and zmabi <dig>  respectively. similarly, zmpp2ca , zmhab <dig>  and zmhai <dig>  were identified in the present work, representing the best hits against arabidopsis sequences, according to tblastn results . table  <dig> also shows sequence similarity comparisons of the arabidopsis and maize snrk <dig> family proteins, which were identified by soderlund et al.  <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis
homology analysis revealed that the aba core signaling components of maize are highly correlated with those of the model plant arabidopsis. phylogenetic tree and motif analyses classified the zmpyls into three subfamilies, comparable to those in arabidopsis, with zmpyl <dig>  zmpyl <dig> and zmpyl <dig> sharing the same branch as atpyr <dig>  atpyl <dig>  atpyl <dig> and atpyl <dig>  zmpyl <dig>  zmpyl <dig>  zmpyl <dig> and zmpyl <dig> grouped with the atpyl <dig>  atpyl <dig>  atpyl <dig>  atpyl <dig>  atpyl <dig> and atpyl <dig> branch. moreover, zmpyl <dig>  zmpyl <dig>  zmpyl <dig> and zmpyl <dig> exhibit close similarity to atpyl <dig>  atpyl <dig>  atpyl <dig> and zmpyl <dig> .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic relationships of the pyr/pyl/rcar aba receptor family , pp2c clade a  and snrk <dig> family  between arabidopsis and maize. an unrooted tree was drawn according to inference based on a neighbor-joining  analysis using the mega  <dig>  program. arabidopsis amino acid sequences were collected from the ncbi database. maize sequences were obtained from blastn searches against arabidopsis gene sets



the pp2cs were distributed between two separate branches, with zmhai <dig> and zmhab <dig> sharing the same branches as zmpp2ca and zmabi <dig>  respectively . the kinase family members zmsnrk <dig>  and zmsnrk <dig> , zmsnrk <dig>  and zmsnrk <dig> , zmsnrk <dig>  and zmsnrk <dig>  and zmsnrk <dig> , zmsnrk <dig>  and zmsnrk <dig>  clustered into the same branches . interestingly, zmsnrk <dig>  remained independent. these results indicated that the zmpyr/pyl/rcar receptor, zmpp2c, and zmsnrk <dig> genes of maize correlate well with the corresponding genes in arabidopsis.

expression of zmpyr/pyl/rcar mrnas in hydroponically grown maize roots and leaves
absolute quantification of the expression of zmpyr/pyl/rcar genes was performed by constructing a calibration curve using serial 10-fold dilutions of plasmids carrying zmpyr/pyl/rcar cdna. the two most highly expressed genes, zmpyl <dig> and zmpyl <dig>  were present at 600– <dig> copies per nanogram of total rna . zmpyl <dig>  zmpyl <dig> and zmpyl <dig> represented an intermediate group with copy numbers in the range of 200– <dig> copies per nanogram of total rna, whereas zmpyl <dig>  zmpyl <dig>  zmpyl <dig>  zmpyl <dig>  zmpyl <dig> and zmpyl <dig> showed low expression, below  <dig> copies per nanogram of total rna. among the later group, zmpyl <dig> in the leaf and zmpyl <dig> in the root were very low to undetectable. the observed expression presents an organ-specific pattern for most of the moderate and highly expressed genes, with zmpyl <dig> and zmpyl <dig> primarily in roots and zmpyl <dig> in leaves. there was no difference between leaves and roots for zmpyl <dig> and zmpyl <dig> gene expression, respectively.fig.  <dig> absolute quantification of zmpyr/pyl/rcar transcripts in roots and leaves of maize seedlings under normal conditions. the top fully expanded leaves and primary roots of 15-day-old seedlings were sampled to extract total rna. the absolute quantification of zmpyr/pyl/rcar was performed using serial dilution of plasmids carrying cdnas of these genes. the results are the means of three biological replicates of four primary roots or leaves, each ± se



dose- and time-dependent transcriptional responses of core aba signaling components to aba in maize roots
eleven aba receptors , three type 2c protein phosphatases , and three protein kinases  were selected for further investigation as core aba signaling components, and the time- and dose-dependent responses in expression of the corresponding genes to exogenous aba were measured in maize primary roots. figure  <dig> shows that the expression of these genes changed significantly after treatment with 1–50 μm aba, with zmpyl4- <dig> being down-regulated in a dose-dependent manner and zmpyl1- <dig> up-regulated; zmpyl <dig> exhibited particularly high up-regulation. the levels of zmpp2cs and zmsnrk2s transcripts rose sharply in a dose-dependent manner following exposure to aba.fig.  <dig> transcriptional responses of aba core signaling components to aba, showing time- and dose-dependent patterns in maize primary roots. the root system of 15-day-old seedlings was exposed to  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> or 50 μm aba for 3 h  or to 1 μm aba for  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> or 3 h . gene expression of aba receptors pyr/pyl/rcar , pp2c  and snrk2s  was measured in the primary roots by real-time pcr. the results are the means of three biological replicates of four primary roots, each ± se



over the examined time gradient, the transcripts of zmpyl <dig> and zmpyl <dig> were dramatically increased after exposure to 1 μm aba for  <dig>  h, whereas the expression of genes zmpyl4- <dig> progressively decreased throughout the time-course. the expression patterns of pp2c family members were similar to each other, remaining stable in the initial  <dig>  h, then slightly increasing and remaining stable thereafter. kinase family transcripts increased continuously during the entire time-course of aba treatment.

dose- and time-dependent transcriptional responses of core aba signaling components to aba in maize leaves
the gene expression pattern of aba receptors in maize leaves was entirely different from that in roots. figure  <dig> shows that after treatment with 1–50 μm aba, transcripts of zmpyl <dig> and zmpyl <dig>  which were up-regulated in roots, as well as that of zmpyl <dig> showed a continuously decreasing expression trend as the aba concentration increased; in contrast, zmpyl7- <dig> transcripts increased under these conditions. the mrna abundance of zmpyl <dig>  zmpyl <dig> and zmpyl <dig> remained stable. zmpyl <dig> gene expression was sharply induced by aba in maize leaves, as observed for zmpyl <dig> in maize roots. although the transcripts of zmabi <dig> and zmsnrk <dig>  increased dramatically after aba treatment, the transcripts of other members of their respective families remained stable or showed insignificant changes.fig.  <dig> transcriptional responses of aba core signaling components to aba, showing time- and dose-dependent patterns in maize leaves. the treatments were similar to those in fig.  <dig>  the topmost largest expanded leaves were sampled from the corresponding treatments. gene expression of aba receptors pyr/pyl/rcar , pp2c  and snrk2s  was measured by real-time pcr. the results are the means of three biological replicates of four leaves, each ± se



the transcripts of all of the examined aba receptors presented a time-dependent response to aba in maize leaves. transcripts of zmpyl1- <dig> and zmpyl5- <dig> continuously decreased during 1 μm aba treatment, whereas the transcripts of zmpyl <dig> and zmpyl8- <dig> increased after  <dig>  h. the mrna abundance of zmpyl <dig> and zmpyl <dig> remained stable during the time-course of 1 μm aba treatment. the transcripts of zmabi <dig> and zmsnrk <dig>  increased greatly, by 300 % and by 200 %, respectively. in contrast, the expression of genes zmpp2ca and zmabi <dig> in the pp2c family and zmsnrk <dig>  and zmsnrk <dig>  in the snrk <dig> family remained fairly stable from the beginning of treatment.

gene expression of core aba signaling components in response to osmotic stress in maize roots
to compare the transcriptional responses of core aba signaling components between aba and osmotic stress, the maize root system was treated with a 20 % peg solution. figure  <dig> shows that with the exception of zmpyl <dig>  all of the remaining zmpyl genes were activated by osmotic stress. the time-course of gene expression indicated that zmpyl <dig>  zmpyl <dig> and zmpyl <dig> are relatively early genes in the response to osmotic stress, whereas zmpyl <dig>  zmpyl <dig>  zmpyl <dig> and zmpyl <dig> are late-response genes. interestingly, zmpyl <dig> was initially down-regulated , returning to the control level at 2 h and finally increasing above the control level. both the zmpp2c and zmsnrk <dig> gene families also exhibited a trend of up-regulated expression in response to 20 % peg, especially the zmpp2ca, zmsnrk <dig>  and zmsnrk <dig>  isoforms.fig.  <dig> transcriptional response of zmpyls , zmpp2c  and zmsnrk <dig>  to polyethylene glycol  in maize primary roots. the root system of 15-day-old seedlings was subjected to 20 % peg for  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>  or 3 h. gene expression was measured by quantitative real-time pcr. the results are the means of three biological replicates of four primary roots, each ± se



gene expression of core aba signaling components in response to dehydration in maize leaves
to compare the transcriptional response of core aba signaling components between aba and dehydration stress, detached maize leaves were subjected to simulated dehydration stress. as shown in fig.  <dig>  aba receptors zmpyl1- <dig>  zmpyl5- <dig> and zmpyl9- <dig> were down-regulated by dehydration but zmpyl <dig>  zmpyl <dig> and zmpyl <dig> significantly up-regulated. in addition, expression of zmabi <dig> increased sharply under dehydration, though zmpp2ca and zmabi <dig> remained stable. similarly, zmsnrk <dig>  expression increased greatly under dehydration treatment, whereas the other two kinases, zmsnrk <dig>  and zmsnrk <dig> , showed almost no response to dehydration.fig.  <dig> transcriptional response of zmpyls , zmpp2c  and zmsnrk <dig>  to dehydration in leaves. the topmost largest expanded leaves of 15-day-old seedlings were detached for  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>  or 3 h before analysis. gene expression was measured by real-time pcr. the results are the means of three biological replicates of four leaves, each ± se



discussion
it is well known that gene functions are closely related to the mechanism by which gene expression is regulated  <cit> . although nearly all corresponding zmpyr/pyl/rcar genes are down-regulated by aba in arabidopsis  <cit> , a portion of them were down-regulated and the others up-regulated in the crop plant maize. overall, highly abundant genes in arabidopsis show low expression in maize and vice versa under normal conditions. the present work addressed the species-specific mechanism regulating perception-related gene expression in response to aba or osmotic/dehydration stress. the following sections mainly discuss the organ-, isoform-, stress type-, duration-, and intensity-specific regulation of the expression of core aba signaling component genes.

organ-specific expression
our findings clearly demonstrated that core aba signaling component genes, especially pyr1/pyl/rcar aba receptor genes, in maize exhibit distinct expression patterns in response to abiotic stresses  between roots and leaves, with isoforms that are up-regulated in roots being down-regulated in leaves, and vice versa. this is the first time that contrasting transcriptional responses of pyr1/pyl/rcar aba receptors to aba have been observed between roots and leaves in a crop plant, and the results differ from those observed in the model plant arabidopsis  <cit> . organ-specific transcriptional regulation of signaling components may allow for variable responses to aba between different parts of the plant under stress conditions. our results also suggest that the relative contributions of individual pyr1/pyl/rcar receptor genes to the stress response differ between roots and leaves. this type of distinguishable aba sensitivity between leaves and roots may be due to the different water conditions experienced by these organs after plants are subjected to water deprivation-related stress  <cit> .

organ-specific expression patterns may also be related to the distinct redundant features of pyr1/pyl/rcar receptor genes between roots and leaves. although antoni et al.  <cit>  showed that pyl <dig> plays a nonredundant role in the regulation of root aba sensitivity, this factor was necessary to generate a pyr1pyl1pyl2pyl <dig> quadruple mutant  to obtain robust aba-insensitive phenotypes in shoots  <cit> , and pyr1pyl1pyl2pyl4pyl5pyl <dig> sextuple mutant  <dig> is at least  <dig> order of magnitude more aba insensitive than  <dig>  <cit> . recently, zhao et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that pyl <dig> promotes lateral root growth independent of the core aba-snrk <dig> signaling pathway. using pyrabactin as an aba mimic, we recently found that activation of pyr <dig> can significantly improve maize root hydraulic conductivity  <cit> . therefore, the distinguishable sensitivity and gene redundancy observed between roots and leaves under both genetic modification of aba receptors and aba mimicry with synthetic aba agonists should be given major attention. in practice, the former phenomenon can be addressed with an organ-specific promoter; for the latter, aba agonists can be selectively used in either roots or shoots.

it is documented that the core snrk2s involved in aba signaling are not regulated by aba treatment in arabidopsis  <cit> ; however, the transcripts of snrk <dig> , snrk <dig>  and snrk <dig>  in maize roots and that of snrk <dig>  in maize leaves are significantly enhanced by aba. the genes encoding the three types of pp2c phosphatases  examined in the present work all presented significant up-regulation patterns in maize roots, whereas only the transcript of zmabi <dig> was induced by aba in leaves. thus, the transcriptional responses of both snrk2s and pp2c to aba are of an organ-specific nature.

isoform-specific expression
the present work revealed that each of the aba receptors may play a distinct role in transmitting signals in maize, as indicated by their position in the phylogenetic tree of this receptor family. based on phylogenetic analysis, zmpyl <dig>  zmpyl <dig> and zmpyl <dig>  zmpyl <dig>  zmpyl <dig>  zmpyl <dig> and zmpyl <dig>  and zmpyl <dig>  zmpyl <dig>  zmpyl <dig> and zmpyl <dig> share the same branches. as clearly shown by our expression profiling in maize roots, the transcripts of zmpyl1- <dig> isoforms increased dramatically following aba treatment, whereas those of the second subfamily members decreased depending on the aba concentration. this distinct phenomenon was also observed in maize leaves, whereby zmpyl <dig> and zmpyl7- <dig> gene expression was up-regulated by aba yet that of zmpyl <dig> and zmpyl <dig> was gradually down-regulated. overall, the expression trends of zmpyl8- <dig>  in the third subfamily, were similar to those of the second subfamily. transcripts of some members of the pyr/pyl/rcar receptor family increased, whereas those of others declined, providing a potential mechanism for restoring aba signaling homeostasis simultaneously in roots and leaves  <cit> .

following exposure to aba, the level of zmpyl <dig> transcript increased dramatically in roots but that of zmpyl <dig> increased significantly in leaves. this may indicate that maize pyr1/pyl/rcar aba receptors that are homologous to dimeric-type arabidopsis aba receptors are mainly involved in transmitting aba signaling in roots, whereas those that are homologous to monomeric-type arabidopsis aba receptors perform this function in leaves. however, this hypothesis is inconsistent with the results obtained by antoni et al.  <cit>  in arabidopsis, indicating that the selective difference observed for pyr1/pyl/rcar receptors between leaves and roots is not conserved among plant species. overexpression of some monomeric, but not dimeric pyr/pyl receptors in both arabidopsis and crop plants is known to enhance the response to aba and plant drought resistance  <cit> , which may reflect differences in sensitivity to drought stress  or different degrees of redundant and organ-specific gene expression . the root expression pattern of pyl <dig> shows some specificity with respect to that of other pyr/pyl receptors in arabidopsis  <cit> , reflective of its crucial role in the hydrotropic response that occurs to guide root growth far from regions with low water potential. this further emphasizes the close correlation between gene expression and function. isoform-specific gene expression of core components of aba signaling is also observed under drought or dehydration conditions in other plant species  <cit> , and it has been shown that different subsets of phosphorylation events may depend on the functional presence of different subsets of the aba receptor family for full aba responsiveness  <cit> . future studies will further elucidate details related to each pyr/pyl/rcar receptor and their individual roles in the aba-regulated response to osmotic stress.

stress duration - and stress intensity -dependent responses
the time-dependent transcriptional response of aba core signaling components to aba or abiotic stress in maize indicated that some members tend to act as early-response genes, whereas others act as relatively late-response genes. in maize roots, zmpyl4- <dig> and zmsnrk2s are relatively early genes in the response to aba, whereas zmpyl1- <dig> and zmpp2c are late genes; in response to osmotic stress, zmpyl8- <dig>  zmsnrk2s and zmpp2ca are early-response genes and zmpyl1- <dig>  zmpyl10- <dig>  zmabi <dig> and zmabi <dig> late-response genes. in maize leaves, zmpyl <dig>  zmpyl <dig>  zmpyl <dig>  zmpyl <dig>  zmpyl8- <dig> and zmabi <dig> are early genes in the response to aba, and zmpyl <dig>  zmpyl <dig>  zmpyl <dig>  zmpyl <dig>  zmabi <dig> and zmsnrk <dig>  are late-response genes. with the exception of zmpyl <dig>  which belongs to the late-response gene group together with zmpp2c and zmsnrk <dig>  the other zmpyl genes responded quickly to dehydration in maize leaves. hence, we conclude that the time-dependent response of the core signaling components to aba is not related to the phylogenetic results but is conserved between maize roots and leaves.

all of the examined zmpyls, zmpp2c and zmsnrk <dig> were sensitive to 1 μm aba in maize roots under our experimental conditions; however, zmpyl <dig> and zmpyl <dig> in the receptor family, zmpp2ca and zmabi <dig> in the zmpp2c family, and zmsnrk <dig>  and zmsnrk <dig>  in the kinase family were not sensitive to this concentration of aba in maize leaves. our results are similar to the findings of merilo et al.  <cit>  in arabidopsis, with the authors reporting that pyr/rcar proteins appear to function in a dose-dependent manner in stomatal regulation induced by ozone, reduced air humidity, darkness and co <dig>  however, controlling the hormone dose/response ratio remains a challenge, as the hormone levels attained should be moderate to maintain a balance between their positive effects on stress tolerance and their negative effects on growth and development  <cit> . according to the model proposed by cutler et al.  <cit> , different stress durations  and intensities  result in different aba levels, and different pyr/pyl/rcar members are therefore activated to sense changes in aba in vivo. as the levels and temporal patterns of stress-derived endogenous aba were different between the leaves and roots , the perception mechanism may be distinct between these structures.fig.  <dig> endogenous aba content of maize seedlings after stress. a mean aba content of maize roots after treatment with 20 % peg <dig> for  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>  or 3 h. b the mean aba content in maize leaves after detachment for  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>  and 3 h. the results are the means of three biological replicates of five primary roots or leaves, each ± se



stress type-specific responses
drought causes osmotic stress in organisms, and osmotic stress causes dehydration and inhibition of water uptake in plants. aba accumulates under osmotic stress conditions and plays an important role in the stress response and tolerance of plants  <cit> . it has been shown that 25–50 % of the genes regulated by aba are also modulated by drought or salinity. the present work also showed that the core signaling components present stress type-specific patterns of regulation. for example, in maize roots, the expression profile of zmpyl <dig> was different when the plant was exposed to aba treatment and osmotic  stress. in leaves, dehydration and aba treatments also induced distinct expression patterns for genes such as zmpyl <dig>  which may in turn lead to distinct functions in responses to different types of stresses.

as several biotic or abiotic stresses may occur simultaneously in field crops, several factors are involved in the accurate transcriptional regulation of aba core signaling components in field-grown plants  <cit> . the sophisticated transcriptional regulation of the pyr/pyl/rcar-mediated aba signaling pathway and the different combinations of these signalosomes in vivo allows the plant to fine-tune its response to environmental fluctuations  <cit> . moreover, we should not rule out aba-independent mechanisms in response to osmotic-related abiotic stress. indeed, the ratio of aba-dependent/aba-independent mechanisms in this case certainly affects aba perception as well as the unique features of aba core signaling components in the whole-plant response. taken together, our results indicate that the core signaling components involved differs in the presence of exogenous aba compared with stress-induced endogenous aba in both leaves and roots.

in addition to the type of specificity indicated above, it should be noted that there are tissue-, cell-, subcellular- and even physiological process-specific responses by aba core components , and such variations in the expression and affinity of receptor and pp2c family members ultimately permit different responses over a wide range of aba concentrations. it is possible that aba perception at different levels may lead to different physiological outputs, further reflecting the sophisticated and diverse adaptive mechanisms that enable plants to survive under adverse environmental conditions. additional studies are required to address the relationship between aba core components and plant developmental stages, as stomatal sensitivity to aba is acquired during leaf development through exposure to an increasingly dry atmosphere in the rosette plant arabidopsis  <cit> . remaining questions also include the roles of individual family members in specific abiotic stress responses or the integrated response to several types of stress.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the present study revealed the distinct expression profiles of  <dig> aba receptors,  <dig> zmpp2cs and  <dig> zmsnrk2s between maize roots and leaves in the presence of exogenous aba or osmotic/dehydration-derived endogenous aba . our results showed that transcripts of zmpyls that are homologous to dimeric-type arabidopsis aba receptors were up-regulated by aba in maize primary roots, whereas those that are homologous to monomeric-type arabidopsis aba receptors were down-regulated. however, this trend was reversed in the leaves in the presence of aba. because zmpyl <dig> and zmpyl <dig> exhibit similar transcript abundance under normal conditions, our findings may represent a novel species-specific regulation mechanism of pyr/pyl/rcar aba receptor gene expression. this organ-specific aba signaling plasticity endows the plant with plasticity in response to adverse environments, thus allowing acclimation to life on land. in addition to further elucidating the mechanism of pyr1/pyl modification at the transcriptional level, our results address the correlation between the function of aba and its signal transduction mechanism.fig.  <dig> contrasting transcriptional responses of core components of aba signaling to exogenous aba or osmotic stress-derived endogenous aba between maize roots and leaves. the expression patterns of core aba signaling components genes are illustrated based on real-time pcr results. the transcripts of zmpyls homologous to monomeric- and dimeric-type arabidopsis aba receptors were up- and down regulated by aba or polyethylene glycol  in maize roots, respectively. this expression trend was reversed in leaves in the presence of aba or dehydration. the transcripts of pp2cs and snrk2s were increased by aba or osmotic stress in roots; in maize leaves, they were induced or maintained at constant levels, depending on the isoform within each family. differences in core signaling components in the presence of exogenous aba versus stress-induced endogenous aba were observed in leaves and roots
