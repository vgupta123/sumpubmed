BACKGROUND
recapitulating pathways of tumor progression by tracing specific molecular lesions is necessary for understanding the disease and for developing novel drug targets and therapies. the idea of utilizing dna methylation profiles to recapitulate tumor progression is even more enticing in that these epigenetic marks are stable and heritable in tumor genomes  <cit> . specifically, this event occurs by the addition of a methyl group to a cytosine residue of a cpg dinucelotide  <cit> . it is recognized that in the normal genome, dna methylation plays a role in mammalian development, imprinting, and x chromosome inactivation  <cit> . recent advances further highlight a critical role of epigenetically mediated gene silencing in tumorigenesis  <cit> . unmethylated cpg islands, located in the promoter regions of tumor suppressor/gatekeeper genes, become densely methylated during tumorigenesis  <cit> . once the de novo methylation takes place, this new mark is maintained in subsequent cycles of cell replication by dna methyltransfereases and other associated proteins, like polycomb repressors  <cit> . the consequence of these molecular events is a gradual accumulation of dna methylation in an affected promoter cpg island. in addition, methylation-associated silencing of tumor suppressor genes can result in cells with a growth advantage. the number of hypermethylated genes tends to increase in more malignant cells, and clonal expansion of proliferating cells may generate specific tumor types marked by their unique epigenetic signatures  <cit> . this epigenetic event is inherently stable, and the silencing information is stored in the dna methylation code of a tumor. therefore, dna methylation analysis can be retrospectively performed on clinical samples, allowing for studies of tumor progression history and for clinicopathological correlation. with the implementation of the state-of-the-art microarray technologies, it is now possible to obtain methylation signatures of multiple genes simultaneously and to classify tumors based on their global methylation patterns  <cit> . the idea of conducting a human epigenome project has recently been conceptualized  <cit>  and is expected to facilitate our fundamental understanding of aberrant epigenetic mechanisms in cancer. in this study, we developed novel clustering and pathway reconstruction algorithms, collectively called heritable clustering, to evaluate a set of methylation microarray data previously generated in our laboratory  <cit> . progressive accumulation of hypermethylated cpg islands was used to characterize breast tumor progression pathways. utilizing these novel algorithms, we correlated specific methylation profiles with patient's clinical phenotypes and reconstructed the epigenetic history germane to tumorigenesis.

tumor progression pathways and recapitulation
abstractly, a tumor progression pathway is a directed graph with nodes corresponding to archetypal tumor stages and a directed edge denoting possible progression from one stage to another . tumor progression pathways are constructed based on the following characteristics:  most cpg islands are unmethylated in normal cells,  cpg island hypermethylation is heritable in tumor cells, and  multiple methylated loci are progressively accumulated during tumorigenesis. based on these properties, we hypothesized that tumor cells have unique epigenetic signatures that are associated with specific cancer subtypes . specifically, we seek to construct patterns and relationships among hypermethylated genes that are progressively accumulated during tumorigenesis. as it is not possible for us to obtain tissues from the same patients at different stages of tumor progression over time, methylation data derived from tumors of different patients are used as surrogates for reconstructing tumor progression history. to accommodate the heritable nature of de novo methylation, a progression pathway ought to adhere to the notion that the hypermethylated loci acquired at each node are passed on to subsequent node. for two nodes a and b, a is an "ancestor" of b and b is a "progeny" of a if there exist nodes v <dig> …, vn such that there is a directed edge from vi to vi+ <dig>  i =  <dig> … , n -  <dig> . with this provided nomenclature, the progressive accumulation of hypermethylated loci is captured in the progression pathway by requiring that ancestor's methylated loci are subsets of their progeny's. furthermore, the phenotypes of progeny nodes are hypothesized to be more aggressive than those of the ancestors'. although existing clustering algorithms  are available for clustering samples, no suitable method can be applied to give temporal directions of progression among different epigenetic clusters. in general, clustering algorithms , including those that have been recently devised for progression modeling with genomic data , treat all observed events as belonging to terminal nodes. this is in contrast with the type of progression models that we wish to build to accommodate the hidden temporal structure so that all nodes, terminal or internal, contain the observed events. such a challenge impedes us from adopting published clustering algorithms without major modifications. therefore, we developed the heritable clustering algorithms to identify and organize clusters into a pathway and to recreate tumor progression pathways.

RESULTS
three stages of heritable clustering are laid out in detail in methods. we outline them here briefly before describing their application to a primary breast tumor dataset and the results. first, we determined the number of clusters, and second we assigned the tumor samples into clusters. finally, the clusters were organized into a pathway structure to capture tumor progression. other well-known clustering methods were also considered as alternatives. except for the likelihood approach, which is based on probabilistic modeling, all the other methods considered here make use of a distance metric .

data
methylation analyses were initially performed on  <dig> intraductal carcinoma from unrelated patients, and their sample amplicons were deposited on the array  <cit> . the studied gene probes were hybridized to the array sequentially to generate composite methylation signatures  <cit> . a total of  <dig> genes were studied for their methylation status  in these tumor samples. these genes were chosen for analysis because of their known involvement in tumor suppression  <cit> . for a description of the methods used for generating the methylation data as well as assigning the discrete methylation values see  <cit> . since gene brca <dig> is not methylated in any tumors, it is excluded from the final data analysis and model building. the remaining  <dig> genes used for pathway recapitulation are gpc <dig>  rassf1a, wt <dig>  plau, hoxa <dig>  cdkn2a, hs3st3b <dig>  brca <dig>  and dapk <dig> . there are also five clinical phenotypes, and the categorical values of each phenotype are considered ordinal, with the lowest level to be adjusted to  <dig> for the heritable clustering analysis:

• yl = age ,

• y <dig> = estrogen receptor /progesterone receptor  ,

• y <dig> = histology ,

• y <dig> = clinical stage , and

• y <dig> = metastasis status .

of the  <dig> samples for which epigenotypes are available, seven have missing data on some of the phenotypic measurements. therefore only the  <dig> samples that have complete data on both epigenotypes and phenotypes were used in the analyses presented in this section to facilitate comparisons among methods, although the likelihood method is amenable to the full set of  <dig> samples.

number of clusters
for the  <dig> samples with complete data, our model selection method was employed to find the optimal number of clusters and its associated parameter values for weight and similarity. specifically, to apply our model selection procedure, we considered parameters w and ε in the range of  <dig>  and  <dig> , and  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively, in increments of  <dig> . we arranged the resulting values of the objective function f in ascending order. the result that optimizes our objective function has  <dig> clusters, with both the w and ε values being  <dig> , as shown in table  <dig>  also shown in the table are the next four best results according to the criterion.

clustering analysis
we applied the two clustering algorithms detailed in methods, sim  and lh , to group the  <dig> tumor samples into  <dig> clusters. for the lh approach, the nine epigenotypes were treated as independent binomial variables, as was the age phenotype. however, since er/pr status and histology  were significantly positively correlated, these two variables were modeled jointly as follows:

p <dig> = p, p <dig> = p, and p <dig> = p =  <dig> - p <dig> - p <dig>  similarly, the high positive correlation between clinical stage and metastasis  led us to the joint modeling of these two variables, which in essence was a binomial probability distribution with parameter p = p or ).

in addition to these two novel clustering methods, we also analyzed the same set of data using three popular clustering methods in the literature, namely, k-means, pam, and hierarchical clustering , setting the number of clusters to  <dig>  for these three popular algorithms and sim, the distance measure was as described in methods with w and ε set to correspond to the choice of the optimal number of clusters , which uses both phenotypic and epigenotypic data. for all algorithms, the starting clustering assignments all use the by-product from the model selection step.

three objective criteria, likelihood, silhouette, and entropy, were used to evaluate the outcomes of the various clustering algorithms. these criteria either try to measure the tightness of the samples within each cluster  or the separation between clusters . our results in table  <dig> show that lh outperformed the others under the likelihood and entropy criteria, with sim being second in both cases. on the other hand, sim came out a winner as far as the silhouette criterion is concerned. both pam and h-clust were not too far off from the optimal achieved by sim in terms of silhouette, but they are not competitive under the other two criteria. the performance of k-means is also mixed. while it did a descent job evaluated under the entropy criterion, its likelihood and silhouette values are quite far from the optimal ones.

pathway recapitulation
shown in figure  <dig> is the recapitulated pathway built from the nodes derived from the lh algorithm, which performed the best for two of the three criteria evaluated. the red wedges in each pie  correspond to hypermethylated loci, while their green counterparts represent the loci that are not hypermethylated. the legend accompanying the figure annotate the organization of the nine loci. the numbers in the parentheses above each node are the phenotype centers arranged in the same order as that described in the data subsection. the numbers in the brackets at the bottom right of each node is a node phenotype score defined by the phenotype center . finally, the pathway network built adheres to strict heritability.

interpretation
the progression pathway presented in figure  <dig> depicts the outcome from pd using the methylation profiles of  <dig> promoter cpg islands found to be hypermethylated in primary breast tumors. these promoter cpg islands were selected because they are linked with known tumor-associated and/or tumor suppressor genes and their expression levels were shown previously to be perturbed by promoter hypermethylation. in this progression pathway, the proposed clustering method selects node centers that not only preserve strict heritability of promoter methylation but also uncover pathways with perfect progression in the  <dig> selected breast tumor phenotypes. this is a sound approach to construct the model as tumor phenotypes progress in a reasonably predictable manner . this coupled with the cumulative nature of promoter methylation in genes whose expressions are known to be perturbed by methylation become the basis of our model. as such, we propose that tumors with more aggressive phenotypes should exhibit higher levels of methylation in this gene panel than the less aggressive tumors. a key utility of the reconstructed progression pathway is that it provides the opportunity to visualize the relationship between methylated gene promoters and the phenotype score. as readily apparent in figure  <dig>  this algorithm portrays complex and non-linear interplays between the methylation data and the phenotype scores.

age phenotype
the first phenotype under consideration is the age of diagnosis. it is known that a young age of tumor onset generally correlates with a more aggressive disease. often dna methylation plays less of a role in tumorigenesis in this subset as evident in nodes al and b <dig>  there are  <dig> patients older than  <dig> and  <dig> patients younger than  <dig>  as such, an age of  <dig> is a reasonable cutoff to segregate pre-menopausal patients  from the post-menopausal patients . this distinction is clearly illustrated by the phenotype summary of node al verses those of nodes a <dig>  and a <dig>  all of these nodes are made up of tumors with little to no promoter methylation in the  <dig> studied genes, yet nodes a <dig> and a <dig> had favorable phenotype scores of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, while node al had a metastasis phenotype and a phenotype score of  <dig> . this age effect is also evident when we examine all of the node phenotype score .

hormone receptor status
er/pr status is another phenotype that distinguishes early stage, less aggressive tumors from late stage, more aggressive tumors. therefore, tumors expressing a measurable level of er and pr  should be clustered to the early and less aggressive nodes of the pathway while tumors without er and pr expression should appear closer to the terminal nodes. upon inspection of figure  <dig>  we noted the phenotype score for er/pr =  <dig> or  <dig> is  <dig>  and  <dig>  for er/pr =  <dig> 

tumor metastasis and histology
another tumor phenotype that should follow stringent progression is tumor metastasis. a tumor that has shed a portion of its cells to distant sites such as lymph nodes represents a late stage, aggressive tumor. as such, tumors with a metastasis value of  <dig> should not appear in a node before tumors with no metastasis . tumor phenotypes relating to histology and tumor staging should progress similarly from a low grade or stage to a high grade or stage in the progression pathway. an intriguing observation is that nodes with a metastasis value of  <dig> have methylation events on average in  <dig> of the genes whereas nodes without metastasis has on average  <dig>  methylation events. node al is an exception in that methylation events of these  <dig> genes are not involved in this archetypal tumor.

promoter hypermethylation
previous analysis on this data set showed that a large number of tumors have concurrent hypermethylation in the promoters of gpc <dig> and rassf1a  <cit> . the progression pathway presented in figure  <dig> shows that promoter methylation of these two genes is an early event in tumorigenesis as evident by the presence of hypermethylation in either rassf1a or gpc <dig> or both in nodes a <dig>  a <dig>  and a <dig>  in the same vein, methylation of wt <dig> and hs3st3b gene promoters seem to be a late event in that wt <dig> methylation occurs in  <dig> out of  <dig> terminal nodes  whereas hs3st3b occurs in  <dig> out of  <dig> terminal nodes . brca <dig> encodes a tumor suppressor gene that functions, in part, in maintaining genomic stability. in this progression pathway, brca <dig> methylation occurs exclusively in er/pr negative tumors . this is intriguing in that most brca <dig> mutant breast cancers are hormone receptor negative and here we showed that brca <dig> hypermethylation is also associated with hormone receptors negativity  <cit> . we also noticed that hypermethylation occurs concurrently in plau and hoxa <dig> as evident in nodes a <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig>  and c <dig>  both of these genes are known to be associated with apoptosis regulation in the mammary gland involution  <cit> . having both of these gene promoters methylated would indeed confer survival advantage to the tumor clones. these types of relationships will not be at all apparent without breaking down the data according to clusters of common phenotype measurements.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we have developed novel methods for each of the three stages of the heritable clustering procedure. although existing clustering methods are applicable to the second stage of the procedure, our proposed clustering algorithms, sim and lh, outperformed their counterparts based on three objective evaluation criteria, for the data examined. furthermore, our heritable clustering procedure seems to be able to capture the biological essence of tumor progression, as discussed below in general, and as elaborated in the above section for the breast tumor example in particular. armed with these encouraging results from the breast tumor data, we plan to apply this framework to build progression models for genome-wide stroma and tumor methylation data that we are currently generating. however, in order for our proposed method to be applicable, judicious selection of relevant loci is an indispensable pre-processing step. in this regard, the resulting plausible and interpretable pathway model from our application to the breast tumor data owes largely to the set of loci that are known to be tumor-associated and/or tumor suppressor genes. furthermore, since our focus of the current paper is on the particular breast tumor data, and our observations of the satisfactory performance of the heritable clustering methods are based on them, further assessment of the performance of heritable clustering for data from other tumor types is warranted in future applications.

the preliminary application of the heritable clustering algorithms to the breast tumor data demonstrates its effectiveness in identifying pathways with unambiguous epigenetic and phenotypic progression. the constructed pathway summarizes the epigenetic and phenotypic data in a way that corresponds to the current understanding of tumor progression. further, the potential of methylation profiles to be used for characterizing tumor progression has been demonstrated. the resulting pathways from our tumor progression pathway recapitulation procedure depend on a number of factors including: 1) distance between tumors ; 2) balance between epigenotype and phenotype data; 3) similarities within clusters; and 4) heritability between nodes. the best results are those that reflect the underlying biological processes that lead to the formation of the primary tumors. our heritable clustering method is designed based on the assumption that epigenetic changes are stably passed from progenitor to progeny cells  <cit> . depending on what stage each tumor is diagnosed, some might have accumulated more epigenetic alternations than others as they have progressed more. in this paper, we capitalize on these epigenetic hallmarks to recapitulate breast tumor progression pathways utilizing cpg island hypermethylation data. in building the tumor progression pathway, the assumption is based on the heritable nature of cpg island hypermethylation passing from the parent node to its progeny nodes as tumor progresses. therefore, the progeny nodes of tumor cells accumulate more hypermethylated gene promoters as they are further along in the progression pathway. the progeny tumor cells are likely to be more aggressive and have more proliferative advantages than the parental cells. hence, we built a tumor progression model by linking the nodes or clusters based on strict heritability and their phenotype scores.

in practice, it is unlikely to recreate a linear temporal clinicopathological history of a cancer developing over time in a single patient as it is unethical to remove part of the tumor and allows a portion to grow for research purposes. to overcome this challenge common to all human genetic and epigenetic studies, we propose to view cpg island hypermethylation as "molecular relics" whereby one can trace how much each tumor has progressed by examining the overall methylation profile as such information is stably transmitted from parent cells to their progeny. the heritable clustering method developed in this paper is designed to uncover the different paths breast tumors can progress. our results from the breast tumor application indicate that this approach is likely to select meaningful progression models and hopefully will assist in the interpretation of pathways having biological and clinical significance.

in this present application of the heritable clustering method, the epigenetic and clinical phenotypic values took on discrete values. however, the method can be extended to analyze other data types where the numerical values of the data are continuous. for instance, the method is well suited for modeling methylation data expressed as intensity ratios from two-color microarray experiments or transcription factor binding enrichment on gene promoters from chip-on-chip experiments. the framework would also allow for other types of biological data, such as microarray gene expression or array cgh data, to be integrated. particular characteristics could also be employed in the selection of genes to be used directly or to be used collectively as a phenotype in the construction of tumor progression pathway. for example, 'cpg island methylator phenotype'  is a distinct trait studied extensively in colorectal cancer. in colorectal cancer, a high frequency of type c  loci was recently described by weisenberger et al.  <cit> . the authors believe that they have arrived at a gene panel to classify cimp comprised of unique underlying genotypes associated with microsatellite instability and braf mutation. the use of the methylation status of this panel of cimp genes or the use of this panel collectively as a cimp phenotype  to construct the tumor progression pathway recapitulation would add another dimension to the model. however, we wish to note that the value of using cimp may be cancer-type dependent. for example, whereas cimp is clearly valued for studying colorectal cancer, whether it should be used in building breast tumor progression pathway is debatable as much less is known about cimp in breast cancer.
