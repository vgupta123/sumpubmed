BACKGROUND
the whitefly bemisia tabaci  is a genetically diverse complex containing some of the most destructive invasive pests of many ornamental and glasshouse crops worldwide  <cit> . the species complex colonizes more than  <dig> different species of plants, transmits many plant viruses, feeds on phloem sap, and promotes the growth of damaging fungi on honeydew excretions deposited on plants  <cit> . recent phylogenetic analysis combined with a pattern of reproductive isolation among genetic groups within b. tabaci indicate that the complex contains at least  <dig> cryptic species, some of which have been referred to as "biotypes" in the last  <dig> years  <cit> . as the separation at the species level within the b. tabaci complex is yet to be fully resolved, we have retained the commonly used term "biotype" to link this study with existing literature. the most predominant and damaging biotypes of b. tabaci are the b and q biotypes  <cit> . while the former is known for its high fitness parameters, the q biotype whitefly has a unique ability to develop and maintain high levels of resistance to major classes of insecticides owing to biological and genetic factors  <cit> .

despite its global importance, genomic sequence resources available for the whitefly are scarce, especially for the q biotype. currently , there are about  <dig> est and  <dig> nucleotide sequences available on ncbi for the b biotype whitefly, and only  <dig> nucleotide sequences have been deposited for the q biotype whitefly. the previous est sequencing efforts for the b biotype whitefly have allowed the development of small-scale microarrays for gene expression analysis in the context of insecticide resistance and parasitoid-whitefly interactions  <cit> . while these studies have highlighted the utility of cdna sequencing for candidate gene discovery in the absence of a genome sequence, a comprehensive description of the genes expressed in insecticide-resistant q biotype whitefly remains unavailable.

over the past several years, the next generation sequencing technology has emerged as a cutting edge approach for high-throughput sequence determination and this has dramatically improved the efficiency and speed of gene discovery  <cit> . for example, the illumina sequencing technology is able to generate over one billion bases of high-quality dna sequence per run at less than 1% of the cost of capillary-based methods  <cit> . furthermore, this next generation sequencing has also significantly accelerated and improved the sensitivity of gene-expression profiling and, is expected to boost collaborative and comparative genomics studies  <cit> . previously, illumina sequencing of transcriptomes for organisms with completed genomes confirmed that the relatively short reads produced can be effectively assembled and used for gene discovery and comparison of gene expression profiles  <cit> . despite its obvious potential, next generation sequencing methods have not yet been applied to whitefly research.

in this study, we generated over three billion bases of high-quality dna sequence with illumina technology and demonstrated the suitability of short-read sequencing for de novo assembly and annotation of genes expressed in a eukaryote without the prior genome information. in a single run, we identified  <dig>  distinct sequences including hundreds of insecticide target and metabolism genes. furthermore, we compared the gene expression profiles of whiteflies during different developmental stages using a digital gene expression system. the assembled, annotated transcriptome sequences and gene expression profiles provide an invaluable resource for the identification of whitefly genes involved in insecticide resistance, development and virus transmission.

RESULTS
illumina sequencing and reads assembly
to obtain an overview of the whitefly gene expression profile at different developmental stages, a cdna sample was prepared from whitefly eggs, nymphs, pupae and adults and sequenced using the illumina sequencing platform. after cleaning and quality checks, we obtained  <dig> million of  <dig> bp reads from one plate  of sequencing. to facilitate sequence assembly, these raw reads were randomly clipped into 21-mers for sequence assembly using soapdenovo software  <cit> . these short 21-mers were assembled, resulting in  <dig> , <dig> contigs . the mean contig size was  <dig> bp with lengths ranging from as small as  <dig> bp to as large as  <dig>  bp. the size distribution of these contigs is shown in additional file  <dig>  using paired-end joining and gap-filling, the contigs were further assembled into  <dig>  scaffolds with a mean size of  <dig> bp including  <dig>  scaffolds larger than  <dig>  bp . after clustering using tgicl software  <cit> , the  <dig>  scaffolds generated  <dig>  distinct sequences with  <dig>  clusters  and  <dig>  singletons  . in this manuscript, the singleton means a scaffold that matches no other scaffolds and the distinct sequences include all the clusters and singletons generated from scaffolds. the size distribution of these distinct sequences is shown in additional file  <dig>  to demonstrate the quality of sequencing data, we randomly selected  <dig> singletons and designed  <dig> pairs of primers for rt-pcr amplification. in this analysis,  <dig> out of  <dig> primer pairs resulted in a band of the expected size and the identity of all five pcr products were confirmed by sanger sequencing .

annotation of predicted proteins
for annotation, distinct gene sequences were first searched using blastx against the non-redundant  ncbi nucleotide database using a cut-off e-value of 10- <dig>  using this approach,  <dig>  genes  returned an above cut-off blast result . because of the relatively short length of distinct gene sequences  and lack of genome information in whitefly, most of the  <dig>  assembled sequences could not be matched to known genes . figure  <dig> indicates that the proportion of sequences with matches in nr databases is greater among the longer assembled sequences. specifically, a 97% of match efficiency was observed for sequences longer than  <dig>  bp, whereas the match efficiency decreased to about 48% for those ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp and to  <dig> % for sequences between  <dig> to  <dig> bp . the e-value distribution of the top hits in the nr database showed that 22% of the mapped sequences have strong homology , whereas 78% of the homolog sequences ranged between  <dig> e- <dig> to  <dig> e- <dig> . the similarity distribution has a comparable pattern with 18% of the sequences having a similarity higher than 80%, while 82% of the hits have a similarity ranging from 18% to 80% . for species distribution, 20% of the distinct sequences have top matches trained with sequences from the hemipteran species pea aphid , followed by the body louse  , red flour beetle   and honey bee   . there were  <dig> distinct sequences with the highest homology to genes from b. tabaci and the majority of these hits were to cytochrome p <dig> and heat shock protein .

gene ontology  and clusters of orthologous groups  classification
go assignments were used to classify the functions of the predicted q biotype whitefly genes. based on sequence homology,  <dig>  sequences can be categorized into  <dig> functional groups . in each of the three main categories  of the go classification, 'cellular process', "cell part" and "binding" terms are dominant respectively; however, we did not find any genes in the clusters of 'symplast', 'chemoattractant' and 'chemorepellent'. we also noticed a high-percentage of genes from categories of 'metabolic process', 'catalytic' and 'pigmentation' and only a few genes from terms of 'cell killing' and 'nutrient reservoir' . to further evaluate the completeness of our transcriptome library and the effectiveness of our annotation process, we searched the annotated sequences for the genes involved in cog classifications. in total, out of  <dig>  nr hits,  <dig>  sequences have a cog classification . among the  <dig> cog categories, the cluster for 'general function prediction' represents the largest group  followed by 'replication, recombination and repair'  and 'translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis' . the following categories: extracellular structures ; nuclear structure  and cell motility , represent the smallest groups . to identify the biological pathways that are active in the q biotype whitefly, we mapped the  <dig>  annotated sequences to the reference canonical pathways in kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes   <cit> . in total, we assigned  <dig>  sequences to  <dig> kegg pathways. the pathways with most representation by the unique sequences were starch and sucrose metabolism ; purine metabolism  and galactose metabolism . these annotations provide a valuable resource for investigating specific processes, functions and pathways during whitefly research.

detection of sequences related to the insecticide targets and metabolism
as the q biotype whitefly is highly resistant to insecticides, we analyzed the sequences related to insecticide targets and metabolism and compared our data with sequences from ncbi nucleotides and est database  <cit> . as shown in table  <dig>  we identified a number of sequences which are homologous to enzymes related to insecticide metabolic resistance, such as carboxylesterase and glutathione s-transferase; and insecticide targets, such as acetylcholinesterase, gaba receptor and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. among them, the gaba receptor sequences were identified from the whitefly for the first time. in total, we obtained  <dig> nicotinic acetylcholine receptor related sequences. after removing redundant sequences, we identified  <dig> different nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits . as an insect genome generally has  <dig> to  <dig> nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits  <cit> , our database represents a nearly complete collection of such genes in whitefly. this finding further demonstrates the quality of our sequencing data and will certainly facilitate q biotype whitefly insecticide resistance research. it was previously observed that the resistance to organophosphates in the b biotype b. tabaci was associated with a point mutation  in ace1-type acetylcholinesterase  <cit> . therefore, we compared the protein sequence of the q biotype whitefly ace1-type acetylcholinesterase with that of the b biotype. sequence alignment shows that the q biotype whitefly acetylcholinesterase also contains the phe392trp mutation . furthermore, three additional mutations were observed in the n-terminal region of the q biotype whitefly ace1-type acetylcholinesterase  which might confer further organophosphate resistance. however, the relevance of these additional mutations requires further investigation.

digital gene expression  library sequencing
an immediate application of our transcriptome sequence data includes gene expression profiling under different physiological conditions. using the dge method, which generates absolute rather than relative gene expression measurements and avoids many of the inherent limitations of microarray analysis, we analyzed the gene expression variations during whitefly development. we sequenced three dge libraries: egg & nymph, pupa and adult, and generated between  <dig>  and  <dig>  million raw tags for each of the three samples . after removing the low quality reads, the total number of tags per library ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  million and the number of tag entities with unique nucleotide sequences ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . for mrna expression, heterogeneity and redundancy are two significant characteristics. while the majority of mrna is expressed at low levels, a small proportion of mrna is highly expressed. therefore, the distribution of tag expression was used to evaluate the normality of the dge data. as shown in figure  <dig>  the distribution of total tags and distinct tags over different tag abundance categories showed similar patterns for all three dge libraries. however, under the distribution of total tags, high-expression tags with copy numbers larger than  <dig> are in absolute dominance whereas low-expression tags with copy numbers smaller than  <dig> occupy the majority of distinct tag distributions . to evaluate the reproducibility of dge library sequencing, we performed pearson correlation analysis for pupa vs. adult and egg & nymph vs. pupa . pearson correlations for the parallel libraries were  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively, indicating the reliability of our experimental results as well as operational stability.

mapping sequences to the reference transcriptome database
to reveal the molecular events behind dge profiles, we mapped the tag sequences of the three dge libraries to our transcriptome reference database generated in the above-mentioned illumina sequencing. this reference database contains  <dig>  distinct sequences with  <dig>  unambiguous reference tags. among the  <dig>  to  <dig>  distinct tags generated from the illumina sequencing of the three libraries,  <dig>  to  <dig>  distinct tags were mapped to a gene in the reference database . tags mapped to a unique sequence are the most critical subset of the dge libraries as they can explicitly identify a transcript. up to  <dig> %  of the sequences in our transcriptome reference tag database could be unequivocally identified by unique tag . to confirm whether the number of detected genes increases proportionally to sequencing amount , a saturation analysis was performed. additional file  <dig> shows a trend of saturation where the number of detected genes almost ceases to increase when the number of reads reaches  <dig> million. next, the level of gene expression was determined by calculating the number of unambiguous tags for each gene and then normalizing this to the number of transcripts per million tags . as summarized in figure  <dig>  the results show that mrna transcribed from the major kinds of genes is represented in fewer than ten copies and only a small proportion of genes are highly expressed. in the additional file  <dig>  we have listed the top  <dig> most abundantly expressed genes from adult whiteflies. while analyzing the five most abundantly expressed genes with annotation, we noticed the presence of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, translation elongation factor  <dig>  cytochrome p <dig> cyp6cx1v <dig> and tubulin alpha chain in all the three libraries.

distribution of dge tags on genes
dge is a sage-based transcript profiling method. in theory, all the sequenced tags in the libraries should be mapped to the last nlaiii restriction site on the sense strand at the 3'-end of the transcript. however, like the results in dge analysis of mouse and zebrafish transcriptomes  <cit> , we found that approximately 60% of the tags mapped to the classical site . this is probably due to the incomplete nlaiii digestion during library preparation and the usage of alternative polyadenylation and/or splicing sites  <cit> . detection of multiple tags with high count numbers for a predicted transcript indicates the reliability of the transcript sequence  <cit> . furthermore, the information obtained from multiple tags per transcript is valuable for the verification of ab initio gene predictions.

changes in gene expression profile among the different developmental stages
to identify genes showing a significant change in expression during different developmental stages, the differentially expressed tags between two samples were identified by an algorithm developed by audic et al.  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  significantly changed tag entities were detected between the adult and pupa whitefly libraries. those tags were mapped to  <dig>  genes with  <dig> genes up-regulated and  <dig>  genes down-regulated . between pupa and egg & nymph libraries, a total of  <dig>  differentially expressed genes were detected with roughly the same amount of up-regulated genes  and down-regulated genes  . this suggests that the number of differentially expressed genes between pupa and adult are larger than that between pupa and egg & nymph. next we analyzed the top  <dig> most differentially expressed genes between samples  . we found that more than 60% of the highly regulated genes are orphan sequences - no homologues found in the ncbi database. this might be consistent with the expectation that hemiptera development expresses genes with no homologues in other species.

functional annotation of differentially expressed genes
to understand the functions of differentially expressed genes, we mapped all the genes to terms in kegg database and, compared this with the whole transcriptome background, with a view to search for genes involved in metabolic or signal transduction pathways that were significantly enriched. among all the genes with kegg pathway annotation,  <dig> differentially expressed genes were identified between pupa and egg & nymph libraries. notably, specific enrichment of genes was observed for pathways involved in energy and lipid metabolism, such as the citrate cycle, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and fatty acid metabolism. in the citrate cycle pathway, all the differentially expressed genes were significantly upregulated in pupa, including pyruvate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, pyruvate carboxylase and citrate synthase. this probably indicates that the metabolic rate of whitefly at pupa stage is higher than that of whitefly at egg & nymph stages. between adult and pupa stages, a total of  <dig> differentially expressed genes were found and a specific enrichment of starch and sucrose metabolism pathways was noticed. interestingly, we also found the enrichment of differentially expressed genes in the glycosphingolipid biosynthesis pathway. to further evaluate our dge data, we analyzed the expression level of vitellogenin which is an egg yolk gene highly expressed in the adult female  <cit> . as shown in figure 8a-b, both vitellogenin  <dig> and vitellogenin  <dig> were highly expressed in the adult whitefly. however, both genes were expressed at significantly lower levels in the pupa stage and only vitellogenin  <dig> is present during the egg & nymph stage. for ecdysone receptor and ecdysone-inducible protein e <dig>  we noticed a much high expression level in nymphs and pupas than that in adult whitefly . this is consistent with their roles in the orchestration of development during molts and metamorphosis  <cit> . as a control, the translation elongation factor  <dig> is equally expressed during the three developmental stages .

CONCLUSIONS
with this study, we present a rapid and cost-effective method for transcriptome and dge analysis using illumina sequencing technology. the single run produced more than  <dig>  distinct sequences with  <dig>  sequences having an above cut-off blast result. these findings provide a substantial contribution to existing sequence resources for the whitefly and will certainly accelerate insecticide resistance research in the q biotype whitefly. to our knowledge, this is the first publication using illumina sequencing technology for an organism without prior genome annotation. additionally, we have demonstrated the feasibility of using illumina sequencing based dge system for gene expression profiling and have provided new leads for functional studies of genes involved in whitefly development.
