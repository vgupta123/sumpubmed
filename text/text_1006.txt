BACKGROUND
atp-binding cassette  proteins form one of the largest protein families that are present in all living organisms on earth. the majority of abc proteins are membrane bound primary transporters, using atp to translocate substrates across extra- and intracellular membranes. in addition, these abc transporters are mostly uniporters, mediating the unidirectional translocation of a substrate  <cit> . the major facilitator superfamily  is another large transporter family present in all living organisms, but as opposed to abc transporters, it comprises secondary carriers that can be either uniporters, symporters or antiporters  <cit> . in most abc proteins two types of domains can be distinguished, an atp-binding domain ) and a transmembrane domain . the highly conserved nbd contains three motifs: a walker a and walker b domain and the abc signature . the nbd binds and hydrolyses atp and provides energy to transport substrates. the tmd consists of five to six membrane spanning helices and provides the specificity for the substrate. full transporters comprise two nbds and two tmds while half transporters have only one of each type and require homo- or heterodimerization to form a functional unit  <cit> . based on the homology of their nbds, abc proteins have been divided into seven subfamilies, abca to abch  <cit> . interestingly, the abch subfamily was discovered during analysis of the drosophila melanogaster genome and is present in all sequenced arthropod genomes to date and teleost fish, but not in mammals, plants or fungi  <cit> .

in humans, abc proteins mainly function in the membrane transport of substrates, including amino acids, sugars, lipids, inorganic ions, polysaccharides, metals, peptides, toxic metabolites and drugs  <cit> . in addition to transporters, the human abc protein superfamily also contains ion channels , receptors  and proteins involved in translation   <cit> . mutations in abc genes have been linked to several human disorders, like cystic fibrosis, adrenoleukodystrophy, sitosterolemia and diabetes  <cit> . furthermore, within the abcb, c and g subfamilies, many genes code for proteins that contribute to resistance of cancer cells against chemotherapeutic agents: the multidrug resistance proteins or p-glycoproteins , the multidrug resistance-associated proteins  and the breast cancer protein   <cit> . in insects, it has been shown that abc transporters have functions that affect metabolism, development and resistance to xenobiotics including insecticides and plant secondary toxic compounds   <cit> . some abc transporters have specific functions that are well documented in arthropods. in d. melanogaster the abcc transporter mdr <dig> controls the export of a germ cell attractant  <cit> . d. melanogaster white, on the other hand, is a member of the abcg subfamily and is involved in the uptake of pigment precursors in the developing eye  <cit> . its orthologs in bombyx mori  and t. castaneum  have similar functions, and w-3oeb. mori mutants and tcabcg-9b dsrna injected adult beetles have white eyes  <cit> . in the tobacco hornworm, manduca sexta, orthologs of human p-gps are essential as they prevent the influx of nicotine across the blood brain barrier  <cit> . insect orthologs of human p-gps and mrps have also been frequently linked to pesticide resistance  <cit> . resistance to pesticides in insects is either related to reduced target-site sensitivity or sequestration/metabolism of the pesticide before it reaches the target site by quantitative or qualitative changes of genes involved in the detoxification process  <cit> . these “detoxification” genes comprise members of the p <dig> mono-oxygenases , glutathione-s-transferases , carboxyl/cholinesterases  and also the less known abc transporters. although the abc transporters have often been overlooked in studies that describe the detoxification toolkit in sequenced insect genomes  <cit> , clear examples of their importance in detoxification have been documented. for example, lanning et al.  <cit>  showed that increased expression of human p-gp orthologues in h. virescens was associated with resistance to thiodicarb, and a mutation in the same abcc member of four different lepidopteran species was recently associated with resistance to the cry1a toxin  <cit> .

complete and correctly annotated gene inventories are a prerequisite to study the biological role and evolutionary history of abc genes. among arthropods, detailed studies of abc families have been published for members of several different insect orders  <cit>  and the crustacean daphnia pulex <cit> . in contrast, besides the identification of nine abc genes in the mange mite sarcoptes scabiei <cit> , there are no reported studies in the subphylum chelicerata , one of the most diverse groups of terrestrial animals  <cit> . recently, the first published draft genome sequence of a chelicerate, the two-spotted spider mite, tetranychus urticae, was reported  <cit> . the spider mite is one of the most polyphagous herbivores known, and has been documented to feed on more than  <dig>  plant species that belong to more than  <dig> different plant families, including many that produce toxic compounds  <cit> . in addition, spider mites are major agricultural pests and are the “resistance champion” among arthropods as they have the most documented instances of resistance to diverse pesticides  <cit> . the molecular mechanisms underlying spider mite resistance to xenobiotics  are less understood compared to insects  <cit> . however, the availability of the draft genome sequence now provides unique information and tools for the study of the role of gene families involved in xenobiotic metabolism in spider mites  <cit> . characterization of spider mite gene families associated with detoxification of xenobiotics, including abc genes, is the first step towards a better understanding of how spider mites cope with these compounds  <cit> . an initial preliminary analysis of abc genes in the spider mite genome focused solely on abcb and abcc subfamilies  <cit> , and lacked a complete description of the phylogenetic relationships with other metazoan abcs. in this study, we provide a detailed comparison of all abc subfamilies  in t. urticae with those of the insect d. melanogaster, the crustacean d. pulex, the nematode caenorhabditis elegans and the mammal homo sapiens. further, we show that expression levels of abc genes change in pesticide resistant strains and when new and challenging plant host are encountered. our analyses will facilitate biochemical and toxicological studies of the role of t. urticae abc transporters in spider mite physiology, and in particular the extraordinary host range and pesticide resistance development.

RESULTS
identification of spider mite abc genes
we identified  <dig> putative abc genes in the genome of t. urticae . to our knowledge, this is the largest number of abc genes reported for any metazoan species so far  <cit> . of all organisms sequenced to date, only the protozoan ciliate tetrahymena thermophila has more abc genes  <cit> . a maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis grouped the t. urticae abc proteins into each of the eight known abc subfamilies with high bootstrap support . we identified  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> abc proteins belonging to the abca, abcb, abcc, abcd, abce, abcf, abcg and abch subfamilies, respectively . significant homology  with one of the  <dig> putative t. urticae abc genes was found at an additional  <dig> loci in the t. urticae genome. however, gene models at these loci, most of which had homology to the abcc or abch subfamilies, lacked one or both vital domains  of canonical abc genes. these likely represent gene fragments or pseudogenized genes, and were excluded from detailed analysis . from the  <dig> full-length t. urticae abc genes, almost half  are located on only  <dig> genomic scaffolds . in addition, a high complexity was observed within gene structures, with exon numbers ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> . to determine the accurate evolutionary position of the  <dig> t. urticae abc proteins, phylogenetic analyses, including full-length abc protein sequences from the draft genomes of t. urticae and d. pulex and from the finished genomes of c. elegans, d. melanogaster and h. sapiens, were performed for each subfamily separately. the results of these analyses are discussed below.

* numbers were derived from  <cit>  and this study; one additional abcg transporter was identified for d. pulex  in this study resulting in  <dig> d. pulex abcs; a c. elegans abcb half transporter discussed by  <cit>  was added to the number of c. elegans abcb half transporters resulting in  <dig> abc transporters for c. elegans.

the abca family comprises  <dig> full transporters  in t. urticae. in contrast to plants and some insects, no abca half transporters  were identified   <cit> . the t. urticae abca subfamily contains the largest t. urticae abc protein, tetur25g <dig>  . abcas share a distinct set of characteristics across species: an extracellular loop between the first and second transmembrane helices , a conserved motif downstream of each nbd  <cit>  and a conserved motif at the n-terminus . all t. urticae abcas have a characteristic extracellular loop between the first and the second tms of each tmd . the conserved motif downstream of each nbd was, except for tetur25g <dig>  present in all t. urticae abcas, while the n-terminus conserved motif could only be found in a single t. urticae abca . instead of xlxxkn, the remainder of t. urticae abcas harbor either a xmxxkd/s  or xlxxhr  n-terminal motif. a phylogenetic analysis of metazoan abcas is shown in additional file  <dig>  six t. urticae abcas  clustered together with high bootstrap support. these six abcas show high amino acid identity  and have identical exonic structure , indicating they might have arisen by recent duplication events. together with tetur01g <dig>  they form a sister-group with d. melanogaster cg <dig>  an abca reported to be down regulated in the salivary glands of an e <dig> mutant of d. melanogaster . d. melanogaster cg <dig> and the seven t. urticae abca genes cluster together, albeit with moderate bootstrap support, with a group of c. elegans abca transporters. the latter contains ced- <dig>  which is involved in the engulfment of cell corpses during programmed cell death in c. elegans <cit> .

further, tetur27g <dig> and d. melanogaster cg <dig> form a sister clade of human abca <dig> and abca <dig>  while tetur25g <dig>  d. pulex dappu1- <dig> and dappu1- <dig> cluster with human abca <dig>  abca <dig>  abca <dig> and abca <dig> . these human abcas contain conserved predicted n-glycosylation sites at n <dig>  n <dig> and n <dig> of human abca <dig>  <cit> . in addition, it has been experimentally shown that d. melanogaster cg <dig> is also glycosylated at an asparagine  aligning with one of these conserved sites . the tetur27g <dig> and tetur25g <dig> proteins also have many predicted n-glycosylation sites  of which at least one  is shared with those conserved in human abca <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  in humans, these abcas have highly specialized roles in phospho- and sphingolipid export  <cit> . for example, human abca <dig> controls the initial steps leading to high-density lipoprotein  formation at the cell membrane and is crucial for reverse cholesterol transport from peripheral tissues to the liver  <cit> . human abca <dig> works as an epidermal keratinocyte lipid transporter and a defective abca <dig> results in loss of the skin lipid barrier  <cit> . although we cannot assign such highly specific roles to the two t. urticae abca orthologues above, they may also be involved in lipid transport processes.

the abcb subfamily consists of  <dig> fts and  <dig> hts in t. urticae . a phylogenetic analysis of abcb fts revealed that transporters of each species in the analysis clustered into separate clades, confirming an earlier hypothesis by sturm et al. that this subfamily has diversified through lineage-specific duplications  <cit>  . this diversification hypothesis is supported in mites by the fact that the t. urticae abcb fts, tetur11g <dig> and tetur11g <dig>  have well-supported phylogenetic clustering, similar exon patterns ) and high amino acid identity . t. urticae abcb fts form a sistergroup to a clade of c. elegans, h. sapiens and d. melanogaster abcb fts. the function of most members of this clade has been well documented in literature. human abcb ft, originally termed p-glycoproteins  but now also known as multiple drug resistance  proteins, are among the best characterized abc pumps and have been shown to be involved in transport of hydrophobic substrates including drugs, lipids, steroids, xenobiotics and peptides . the precise role of their orthologues in drosophila has been a focus of recent study. d. melanogaster mdr <dig> has been shown to function as an orthologue of human abcb1/mdr <dig>  a major abc transporter of cytotoxic xenobiotics at the human blood–brain barrier, and is required for chemical protection of the fruitfly brain  <cit>  while mdr <dig> has been shown to be essential in germ cell migration  <cit> . interestingly, arthropod abcb ft orthologues have frequently been linked to pesticide resistance  <cit> . for example, inhibition of a h. virescens orthologue of human abcb <dig> by the p-gp inhibitor quinidine decreased the toxicity of thiodicarb by  <dig> -fold in a resistant strain, compared to  <dig> -fold in a susceptible strain  <cit> . recently, it was found that pretreatment of d. melanogaster with the p-gp inhibitor verapamil reduced the toxicity of ddt by 10-fold in a resistant strain  <cit> . the involvement of p-gps in pesticide resistance is probably best documented for ivermectin resistance. this compound has been shown to be a substrate for both mammalian as insect-pgps and several cases of p-gp associated ivermectin resistance have been reported  <cit> .

a phylogenetic analysis of abcb hts revealed, as was also shown by sturm et al.  <cit> , clear orthologous relationships between abcb hts, suggesting they have evolutionary conserved roles in metazoan species . in the case of t. urticae abcb hts, an orthologous relationship between tetur32g <dig> and d. melanogaster cg <dig>  d. pulex dappu1- <dig>  c. elegans abtm- <dig> and human abcb <dig> was found, while tetur17g <dig> groups together with d. melanogaster cg <dig>  d. pulex dappu1- <dig>  c. elegans haf- <dig>  and human abcb <dig>  as both tetur32g <dig> and tetur17g <dig> are predicted  to have a mitochondrial targeting signal, these t. urticae transporters are most likely trafficked to the mitochondria, as has been demonstrated for their human orthologues   <cit> . this suggests that tetur32g <dig> and tetur17g <dig> fulfill a similar role as their human orthologues. the human abcb <dig> protein plays a crucial role in iron homeostasis in the cytoplasm and mutations in this gene have been linked to several diseases  <cit> . recently, it was also shown that disruption of the c. elegans orthologue  of human abcb <dig> induced oxidative stress and premature cell death  <cit> . furthermore, an orthologue  of human abcb <dig> in the dengue vector, aedes aegypti, was reported to be upregulated in an insecticide resistant strain  <cit> . the function of human abcb <dig> is not well understood, but it was shown to mediate resistance against the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin in melanoma cells  <cit> . also, ichikawa et al. found that disruption of the mouse orthologue of human abcb <dig> lead to cardiomyopathy and decreased mitochondrial iron export  <cit> . orthologues of the remaining human mitochondrial transporters, abcb <dig> and abcb <dig>  could be identified in d. pulex, d. melanogaster and c. elegans but were not found in t. urticae <cit>  . interestingly, the localization of human abcb <dig> is currently under debate, as some studies suggest that it is located in lysosomes  <cit> . finally, similar to sturm et al.  <cit> , we did not identify arthropod orthologues of human abcb hts related to antigen processing  .

the abcc subfamily consists of  <dig> transporters in t. urticae. to our knowledge, this is the largest number of abcc transporters reported in any metazoan species, including the flour beetle, t. castaneum, which also has an exceptionally large number of abccs  <cit>  . abcc proteins are fts, bearing  <dig> tmds and  <dig> nbds, with diverse functions: ion transport, cell-surface receptor activity and translocation of a broad array of substrates like drugs, cyclic nucleotides, endogenous compounds and their glutathione conjugates and glutathione  <cit> . because of their ability to extrude drugs, many of these abccs are also termed multidrug resistance associated proteins   <cit> . mrps can be categorized according to the presence or absence of a third n-terminal transmembrane-spanning domain  . in humans, “long” mrps like abcc <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  have such a tmd <dig> while “short” human mrps like abcc <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> do not   <cit> . in addition to mrps, the abcc family also harbors the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator  and sulfonylurea receptors   <cit> .

in our phylogenetic analysis,  <dig> t. urticae abccs clustered with d. melanogaster cg <dig>  d. pulex dappu1- <dig> and a group of human “long” mrps  . twenty-two of the transporters  from this t. urticae abcc clade also have a tmd <dig>  while we could not identify this additional transmembrane domain in tetur28g <dig>  , additional file 3). within this t. urticae abcc clade, transporters clustered into  <dig> distinct groups. one group  consists of  <dig> t. urticae abcc genes, each with  <dig> introns, and tetur04g <dig>  which has only  <dig> introns . interestingly, tetur04g <dig> is positioned at the basal node, indicating that intron gain events may have occurred in this group . the other group  consists of  <dig> t. urticae abcc genes:  <dig> with  <dig> introns, tetur25g <dig> with  <dig> introns and tetur28g <dig> having only  <dig> introns . the intron loss in tetur28g <dig> can be directly linked to the lack of the tmd <dig> , while the nature of the intron gain event in tetur25g <dig> is unclear . human mrp <dig>  mrp <dig>  mrp <dig> and mrp <dig> along with d. melanogaster cg <dig> and d. pulex dappu1- <dig> form a sister clade of t. urticae abcc groups  <dig> and  <dig> . these proteins have been extensively studied as transporters of natural product drugs like anthracyclines and plant alkaloids  <cit> . mrps also share many substrates with human p-gps  but, while p-gps transport drugs in their original form, mrps mostly transport their glucuronate, sulfate and glutathione  conjugates. in the latter case, gsh is fused by gsts with xenobiotics or their metabolites and finally transported out of the cell by mrps  <cit> . in humans, gsts from the alpha, mu and pi-class have been reported to act in synergy with mrps  <cit> . intriguingly, a clear expansion of gsts in the t. urticae genome was found for the delta and mu gst subclasses, the latter of which is not present in insects and until recently was believed to be vertebrate specific  <cit> . future studies should point out if there is a coordinated action between the gsts of these subfamilies and the many mrp orthologues of t. urticae.

 see the legend of figure  <dig> for procedure and display details.

most of the biochemical properties of human mrp <dig> have been confirmed in its d. melanogaster orthologue cg <dig>  <cit> . recently, it was also found that exposure to the p <dig> mono-oxygenase inhibitor piperonylbutoxide and the antimetabolite/antifolate drug methotrexate alters the expression  of the d. melanogaster cg <dig> gene in the malpighian tubuli, which are organs known to play important roles in excretion and xenobiotic detoxification  <cit> . the orthologue  of cg <dig> in the human body louse, pediculus humanus, has also been reported to be upregulated after exposure to the pesticide ivermectin. moreover, injection of phabcc <dig> dsrna in p. humanus female lice increased their sensitivity to ivermectin by 20-30%  <cit> .

fourteen spider mite abccs clustered with high bootstrap support in a group with  <dig> d. melanogaster abcc proteins, human abcc4/mrp <dig> and abcc <dig> and d. pulex dappu1- <dig> . all fourteen t. urticae abccs show the structural properties of “short” mrps , additional file 3). five of these t. urticae abccs group as a sister clade  of the  <dig> d. melanogaster abcc proteins . detailed physiological roles for most of the  <dig> d. melanogaster abcc proteins are unknown. d. melanogaster cg <dig> is regulated by heavy metals through the metal-responsive transcription factor  <dig>  and contributes to metal homeostasis  <cit> . d. melanogaster cg <dig> controls responsiveness to o <dig> deprivation and might also be involved in oxidative stress response  <cit>  while 31% of embryos of d. melanogaster cg <dig> mutants were unable to heal wounds  <dig> h postwounding  <cit> . recently, it was also shown that d. melanogaster cg <dig>  which is highly expressed in the midgut, was upregulated in cyp6g <dig> knockdown flies, indicating molecular crosstalk within a detoxification network  <cit> . furthermore, a point mutation in lepidopteran homologs of this d. melanogaster abcc group has been clearly linked with resistance against the b. thuringiensis cry1a toxin  <cit> . another  <dig> t. urticae abccs  form, together with d. pulex dappu1- <dig> and the  <dig> d. melanogaster and five t. urticae abccs  a sister clade of human abcc <dig> and abcc <dig> . the function of d. pulex dappu1- <dig> is not known, but human abcc7/cftr acts as a chloride channel, a unique function not found in any other abc transporter  <cit> . in our analysis, cftr clustered with human abcc4/mrp <dig>  which is its closest abc paralog according to jordan et al.  <cit> . human mrp <dig>  have the ability to transport a range of endogenous molecules involved in cellular signaling, like cyclic nucleotides, eicosanoids and conjugated steroid hormones  <cit> . as a drug transporter, mrp <dig> also stands out for its broad substrate specificity, covering antiviral, antibiotic, cardiovascular and cytotoxic agents  <cit> .

interestingly, many transporter genes in t. urticae abcc groups 1– <dig> form closely related sister groups and show high amino acid identity between their corresponding protein sequences . together with their conserved exon pattern , this strongly suggests that multiple tandem duplications underlie the proliferation of these genes. this is in contrast to the crustacean d. pulex, which has only few abcc genes  <cit> , and more closely resembles what is generally observed for insects, where gene duplication of abcc genes occurs frequently  <cit> .

furthermore, clear orthologous relationships were found for the two remaining t. urticae abccs: tetur03g <dig> and tetur11g <dig>  tetur03g <dig> clustered as an orthologue of d. melanogaster cg <dig>  d. pulex dappu1- <dig> and human abcc10/mrp <dig> . similar to its orthologues, tetur03g <dig> has a tmd <dig> <cit>  , additional file 3). the functions of d. melanogaster cg <dig> and d. pulex dappu1- <dig> are not known. a growing understanding of the physiological role of human abcc10/mrp <dig> is, on the other hand, beginning to emerge. human mrp <dig> is distinct from other human abccs in that it shows little or no activity towards glutathione, sulfate conjugates and cyclic nucleotides, substrates that can be handled by other human mrps . instead, human mrp <dig> is able to confer resistance to taxanes )  <cit> . however, the presence of one-to-one orthologues in other metazoans, might indicate a more conserved function of this abcc protein in this group of species.

tetur11g <dig> is located in the same clade as d. pulex, human and d. melanogaster sulfonylurea receptors . in contrast to vertebrates, the n-terminal sur interpro-motif  is not present in tetur11g <dig> and other arthropod surs . however, the presence of a tmd <dig> typical for surs and “long” mrps  <cit> , and the well-supported clustering with human abcc8/sur <dig> and abcc9/sur <dig> support the idea that tetur11g <dig> is a sur homologue. four sur subunits assemble into an octameric complex with four pore-forming subunits, characteristic for inwardly rectifying potassium  channels, to form atp-sensitive potassium  channels  <cit> . three orthologues of these pore- forming subunits were also found in the t. urticae genome  of d. melanogaster), suggesting that a functional katp channel can be formed in t. urticae. katp channels are involved in multiple physiological processes, with roles in glucose homeostasis, ischemic protection and innate immunity  <cit> . intriguingly, in  <dig> it was suggested that the sur was the direct target of benzoylureas, a group of chitin synthesis inhibitors  <cit> . this was largely based on similar effects of glibenclamide, a well-known sur inhibitor in humans and anti-diabetic drug, on the inhibition of chitin synthesis. however, it was later shown by gangishetti et al.  <cit>  that sur is not expressed in the d. melanogaster epidermis, where chitin disruption is observed. recently, based on genetic mapping of etoxazole resistance genes, it was suggested that the action of chitin synthesis inhibitors is mediated by a direct interaction with chitin synthase, a processive glycosyl transferase  <cit> . the lack of a role for sur in chitin production, transport or metabolism is further confirmed by recent studies, where it was shown that the sur receptor is dispensable for chitin synthesis in d. melanogaster <cit> , and rnai knockdown of its orthologue in t. castaneum did not result into a phenotype  <cit> . elucidating the role of sur in t. urticae will therefore require additional studies.

finally, no orthologues of human abcc <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were identified in t. urticae, although three orthologues were found in the genome of d. pulex , confirming earlier findings by sturm et al.  <cit> . surprisingly, a single nucleotide polymorphism in human abcc <dig> was identified as the determinant of the human earwax type  <cit> . however, the potential roles of related transporters in other organisms  are not clear.

the abcd subfamily harbors hts that in humans are located in the peroxisome where they are involved in the import of long and branched chain acyl-coa into this organelle  <cit> . the t. urticae genome has  <dig> abcd genes, tetur05g <dig> and tetur35g <dig> . this number of abcd genes equals those found in insects  <cit>  while  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are found in the genomes of d. pulex, h. sapiens and c. elegans, respectively . t. urticae abcds carry the eaa-like motif between tm <dig> and tm <dig> and the loop <dig> motif ), both considered to be essential for canonical abcd function  <cit> . the clear orthologous relationships we identified between t. urticae abcds and other metazoan abcds  suggests that the function of t. urticae abcds is likely to be conserved with those in other metazoans.

the abce and f proteins are characterized by two linked nbds, but lack tmds and thus are involved in biological processes other than transport. the abce protein is essential in all eukaryotes examined to date and is one of the most conserved proteins known  <cit> . human abce <dig> was first discovered as an inhibitor of rnase l  <cit> , but was later found to have a more fundamental role in ribosome biogenesis and translation regulation  <cit> . in line with all eukaryotes to date, we found one abce protein  in t. urticae  and table 2) that has high amino acid identity  with d. melanogaster abce <dig>  . similar to human abce, abcf <dig> is involved in translation regulation, but probably does not play a role in ribosome biogenesis  <cit> . in most eukaryotes  <dig> abcf genes are found, and t. urticae conforms to this expectation  and table 2). the essential role of abce and abcf genes was recently shown in the flour beetle, t. castaneum, where rnai–mediated knockdown of members of the abce and f families resulted in 100% mortality in penultimate larvae  <cit> .

a phylogenetic analysis of abce and abcf proteins was performed together . tetur30g <dig> grouped with metazoan abce <dig> orthologues, while each t. urticae abcf  clustered into well-supported separate clades with its metazoan orthologues, c. elegans f42a <dig>  excluded . the abce and abcf subfamilies are highly conserved, and t. urticae abce <dig> and abcfs probably have analogous roles as their orthologues in other metazoans.

the abcg transporter family is present in most metazoan species, fungi and plants such as arabidopsis. for metazoan species, only abcg hts have been reported to date, while in plants and fungi also abcg fts are present  <cit> . in humans, abcg hts are primarily implicated in transport of endogenous and dietary lipids, while the human abcg <dig> functions as a multidrug efflux pump  <cit> . within the t. urticae genome we identified  <dig> abcgs, all having a typical reverse domain organization  , see additional file 3). a similar number of abcgs has also been found in d. pulex, and is the highest reported among metazoan species  <cit>  . according to sturm et al.  <cit> , the high number of abcg genes in d. pulex and d. melanogaster genomes is due to extensive lineage specific duplications. our phylogenetic analysis confirms this hypothesis not only for these two arthropod species but also for t. urticae, with twenty out of  <dig> abcgs grouping into one of the two t. urticae specific clades .

one clade  consists of  <dig> t. urticae abcgs, each having a maximum of  <dig> intron . another t. urticae specific abcg clade comprises  <dig> transporters of which  <dig> are located next to each other on scaffold  <dig>  these seven abcgs show high amino acid identity  and have a conserved exon pattern , indicating a common origin by successive tandem duplication events. together with tetur06g <dig> and tetur02g <dig> they form a well-supported sister clade of d. melanogaster white and its d. pulex orthologues. interestingly, no orthologues of d. melanogaster abcgs brown and scarlet were found in t. urticae, while only one d. pulex orthologue of scarlet could be identified . about a century ago, the discovery of d. melanogaster white mutants with a remarkable eye-color phenotype marked the beginning of drosophila genetics. as a consequence, d. melanogaster white is one of the most intensively studied fruit fly genes  <cit> . d. melanogaster white dimerises with either d. melanogaster scarlet or brown to form a transporter involved in the uptake of pigment precursors  in cells of developing compound and simple eyes  <cit> . t. urticae has, in contrast to d. pulex and d. melanogaster, no compound eyes and only four simple eyes   <cit> . although no t. urticae orthologues of scarlet or brown were identified, dimerisation between the nine t. urticae co-orthologues of d. melanogaster white might result in a transporter capable of translocating pigment precursors into the cells of the spider mite ocelli . however, these transporters might also have other functions besides transporting pigment precursors, as in other species roles have been documented in courtship behavior  <cit> , transport of biogenic amines  <cit>  and uptake of uric acid  <cit>  as was shown for d. melanogaster white and/or its b. mori orthologue.

in the middle of the abcg phylogenetic tree, tetur01g <dig> clustered with human abcg <dig>  d. melanogaster cg <dig> and d. pulex dappu1- <dig>  while tetur01g <dig> clustered with human abcg <dig>  d. melanogaster cg <dig>  and d. pulex dappu1- <dig>  c. elegans orthologues of human abcg5/ <dig> could not be identified . similar to human abcg5/ <dig>  d. melanogaster cg31121/cg <dig> <cit>  and d. pulex dappu1-258299/dappu1- <dig> <cit> , tetur01g <dig> and tetur01g <dig> are found juxtaposed in a head to head orientation. annilo et al.  <cit>  have suggested an evolutionary constraint on the separation of these genes, probably for the maintenance of shared regulatory regions. in humans, abcg <dig> and abcg <dig> are both glycoproteins and obligate heterodimers that limit intestinal absorption and promote biliary excretion of neutral sterols  <cit> . both tetur01g <dig> and tetur01g <dig> have at least one well-predicted glycosylation site . together with their head-to-head arrangement and the well-supported clustering with human abcg <dig> and  <dig>  it seems likely that these t. urticae abcgs have similar functions as their human counterparts.

a clear orthologous relationship was found between tetur17g <dig>  d. melanogaster cg <dig> and d. pulex dappu1- <dig>  d. melanogaster cg <dig>  also known as e <dig> , is a 20-oh ecdysone  induced abc transporter that is capable of regulating 20e responses during metamorphosis, probably by removing 20e from cells  <cit> . recently, broehan et al.  <cit>  showed through rnai-mediated knockdown experiments and expression profiling that the t. castaneum orthologue of e <dig>  appears to serve a similar function in metamorphosis. in addition, it is also believed that e <dig> controls the circadian clock in adult flies through ecdysone-mediated expression of the clock gene vrille <cit> . interestingly, it was shown that not only the b. mori orthologue of e <dig>  but also four other midgut-specific b. mori abcg genes  could be induced by 20e  <cit> . as t. urticae uses a different molting hormone  compared to arthropods  <cit> , future experiments are required to establish if tetur17g <dig> has a similar function as its insect counterparts, and more specifically whether it can be induced by ponasterone a.

t. urticae orthologues of human abcg <dig> and  <dig> were not identified in the phylogenetic analysis of abcg transporters, and only one was found in d. melanogaster  and d. pulex  . the function of human abcg <dig> is not well understood, while it is proposed that human abcg <dig> functions in conjunction with human abca <dig> and is involved in cholesterol homeostasis  <cit> . the d. melanogaster orthologue of human abcg <dig>  has been poorly characterized, but is expressed in the trachea  <cit> . finally, no clear orthologues of human abcg <dig> were identified . this transporter is the most thoroughly characterized human abcg and is capable of transporting an array of substrates, including anticancer drugs  <cit> . because of this feature, it has been proposed that arthropod abcgs could be involved in pesticide resistance  <cit> . however, to the best of our knowledge there has only been two studies that correlated increased arthropod abcg expression levels with resistance. in both reports, however, no functional evidence was obtained  <cit> . in fungi on the other hand, several cases of abcg fts involved in fungicide resistance, have been reported  <cit> .

the abch subfamily was first discovered in d. melanogaster and is lacking in mammals, plants or fungi  <cit> . in addition to arthropods , members of this subfamily have also been reported in teleost fish  <cit> . most insects have only  <dig> abch genes, while  <dig> and  <dig> are present in d. pulex and t. urticae, respectively . liu et al.  <cit>  suggested that all insect abchs diversified from a common ancestral copy. according to our phylogenetic analysis, this insect ancestor seems not to be shared with t. urticae abch proteins . tetranychus abchs clustered, similar to d. pulex abchs , into a distinct clade, indicating that the diversity of the abch family in t. urticae has been due to lineage specific duplications. interestingly,  <dig> of the  <dig> t. urticae abchs appear to be intronless . although abchs have the same structural organization as metazoan abcgs , their physiological functions have remained enigmatic. in the zebrafish, d. rerio, abch <dig> has highest expression in brain, gills and kidney followed by lower expression in intestine, gonads, skeletal muscle and liver  <cit> . d. melanogaster abchs are enriched in the adult crop and hindgut  <cit>  and at least one of them  is glycosylated as shown by mass spectrometry of n-glycosylated peptides  <cit> . an rnai screen of d. melanogaster genes revealed that an rnai line that silences cg <dig> is lethal  <cit> . in addition, microarray analysis demonstrated an almost two-fold upregulation of a d. melanogaster abch  after cold hardening of adult fruit flies  <cit> . in the diamondback moth plutella xylostella, it was recently found that an abch transporter  was the most up-regulated abc gene in two resistant strains  <cit> . the most groundbreaking finding about insect abch function was just recently reported by the excellent study of broehan et al.  <cit> . rnai-mediated knockdown of an abch gene  in t. castaneum larvae resulted in dessication and 100% mortality. injection of tcabch-9c dsrna into adults also drastically reduced the number of eggs laid and all eggs failed to hatch. furthermore, cryosections of tcabch-9c dsrna injected larvae stained with nile red  revealed a lack of lipids in the epicuticle. based on these results, the authors suggested that tcabch-9c functions as a transporter of lipids to the cuticle and is required for the formation of a waterproof barrier in the epicuticle.

expression profiling of abc genes
we assessed expression of abc genes across development in the t. urticae london reference strain, as well as in london after transfer from a benign host  to two more challenging hosts . for the developmental and host transfer experiments, we used existing rna-seq reads, but we recalculated gene expression using newly described or corrected abc gene models curated as part of this study. we further examined previously published microarray data to assess the expression profiles of abc genes in two spider mite strains, mr-vp and mar-ab, that are resistant to multiple pesticides  <cit> .

as assessed by rna-seq expression quantification, the majority of abc genes were found to be expressed –  <dig> of the  <dig> full length t. urticae abc genes had an rpkm of > <dig> in at least one of the spider mite life stages or on one of the plant hosts . in contrast, nearly all t. urticae abc fragments or pseudogenes were not expressed . most full-length t. urticae abc genes for which we detected no expression across development or on different hosts belonged to either abca, c or g subfamilies, many of which are tandem duplicated genes , figure 6). in c. elegans, tandem duplicated genes were shown to be subfunctionalized, with strong stage or tissue dependent expression  <cit> . whether t. urticae abc genes that lacked expression support in the existing data are expressed at low levels, in highly restricted expression domains, or alternatively are expressed under specific environmental conditions , remains to be determined.

many t. urticae abc genes were broadly expressed, and more than half  were expressed across all developmental stages analyzed . however, the expression of many abcc and abch genes was restricted  in larvae and nymphs; overall, embryos and adult females had the highest number of non-expressed abcs ). furthermore, tetur30g <dig> and tetur20g <dig>  members of the abce and abcf subfamilies respectively, showed very high expression in all stages , coinciding with their presumed conserved role in translation regulation . similar high expression of the t. castaneum abce gene was reported in all developmental stages examined  <cit> . finally, within the other abc subfamilies, tetur27g <dig> , tetur11g <dig> , tetur04g <dig> , tetur05g <dig> , tetur02g <dig>  and tetur28g <dig>  had the highest average expression across developmental stages .

upon host transfer,  <dig> and  <dig> abc genes were differentially expressed in strain london mites transferred from bean to arabidopsis and tomato plants, respectively . we found that 73%  of the differentially expressed abc genes in mites transferred to arabidopsis were also differentially expressed on tomato, and belonged to three subfamilies, abcc , -g  and -h . surprisingly, abc genes differentially expressed in two multi-pesticide resistant t. urticae strains as detected with expression microarrays  <cit>  belonged to the same abc subfamilies as identified with rna-seq data in the host transfer experiment . the abcc subfamily has been frequently linked with xenobiotic detoxification in arthropods . on the other hand, arthropod members of the abcg and h subfamilies have only very recently been reported to be associated with detoxification of xenobiotic compounds . the differential expression of members from these abc subfamilies  upon host transfer/exposure to xenobiotics should be further  validated in future studies.

it is worth noting that the differentially expressed t. urticae abcc, -g and -h genes mentioned above were not among the most highly differentially expressed genes in these experiments, both in expression level and fold change. in total,  <dig> and  <dig> differentially expressed genes were identified in the two multi-resistant strains  <cit> . likewise,  <dig>  and  <dig>  differentially expressed genes were detected in mites when fed on arabidopsis and tomato in comparison with bean, respectively  <cit> . the major facilitator superfamily, another large and widespread transporter family  <cit> , showed overall a more pronounced response both in the number of genes differentially expressed, and in the fold change values of differentially expressed genes in both resistant strains and after host plant change  <cit> . thus, despite the exceptional number of abc transporters in the t. urticae genome, other transporters and non-transporter proteins also play key roles in the detoxification of xenobiotics  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the spider mite t. urticae is among the most polyphagous pests worldwide and is notorious for its ability to develop resistance against numerous pesticides. one of the prerequisites to study xenobiotic metabolism  in this species is to inventory genes related to detoxification. here, we provide a survey of the abc gene superfamily, whose members have frequently been reported to play roles in detoxification, either by directly transporting toxicants out of cells, or after conjugation with glutathione. we identified  <dig> abc genes  in the genome of the spider mite t. urticae. to date, this is the largest number of abc genes reported in any metazoan species. the large number is mainly due to lineage-specific expansions in subfamilies c, g and h. of particular note, most of the differentially expressed abc genes in acaricide resistant strains and after introduction of mites to challenging host plants belong to these expanded abc subfamilies. this hints at their potential role in detoxification and may explain their retention after duplication in the mite genome. however, obtaining functional evidence that members of these abc subfamilies contribute to xenobiotic tolerance should be the priority of further research.

due to the lineage specific expansions in the abcc, g, and h families, inferring the function of specific t. urticae abc family members based on phylogenetic relationships is not straightforward. nevertheless, we found clear orthologous relationships between some of the t. urticae abc proteins and human abcc <dig>  abcg <dig> and abcg <dig>  the d. melanogaster sulfonylurea receptor and the ecdysone-regulated transporter e <dig>  furthermore, we found a high conservation between t. urticae abc proteins and members of the abcb-half transporters and abcd, -e, and –f subfamilies, which are known to be involved in fundamental processes. to conclude, this study provides the first thorough abc gene analysis of a polyphagous arthropod herbivore and represents a useful resource for future biochemical and toxicological studies on the role of abc transporters in the extremely broad host range and development of pesticide resistance of t. urticae.
