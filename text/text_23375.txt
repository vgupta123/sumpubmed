BACKGROUND
spinal muscular atrophy  is a neuromuscular disease characterized by the loss of spinal motor neurons and muscle atrophy  <cit> . sma has an incidence of  <dig> in  <dig>  live births, and is one of the most common genetic causes of infant death  <cit> . clinically, based on the age of onset and severity of the disease, childhood sma can be categorized into types i, ii, and iii  <cit> . type i patients are diagnosed between the ages of zero to six months and cannot sit unsupported or lift their heads, type ii patients are diagnosed between the ages of seven and  <dig> months and can sit, and type iii patients are older than  <dig> months when diagnosed and can stand alone and walk but may later lose these motor milestones. although sma shows a broad spectrum of severity, genetic studies indicate that all clinical phenotypes of sma are caused by deletion or mutation of the survival motor neuron  <dig>  gene  <cit> .

the smn protein is ubiquitously expressed and localizes in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus, where it is usually concentrated in subnuclear structures referred to as "gems" . the smn protein plays an essential role in the biogenesis of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein  and small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein  complexes  <cit> . smn appears to perform this function by associating with gemins 2– <dig>  <cit> . recent studies have demonstrated that the associated smn/gemin complex directly interacts with specific domains of sm proteins and uridine-rich snrnas to ensure stringent control of snrnp assembly  <cit> . in addition to rnp assembly, smn has been shown to play a role in neurite outgrowth  <cit> , through its association with hnrnp r  <cit> .

complete loss of smn in species ranging from s. pombe to mice is lethal, indicating that smn is critical for survival of multiple cell types  <cit> . more direct evidence to support smn's role in cell survival comes from studies in cultured cells  <cit> . for example, depletion of the smn protein in drosophila s <dig> cells stimulates caspase activity and leads to increased cell death  <cit> . importantly, smn has been shown to play a role in neuronal cell survival. depletion of smn in differentiated p <dig> cells activates caspase activity and increases cell death  <cit> , whereas overexpression of human smn  protects differentiated pc <dig> cells from cell death induced by neurotrophic factor withdrawal  <cit> .

previously, we investigated the role of smn in cell survival using skin fibroblasts derived from sma patients and age-matched controls  <cit> . we demonstrated that sma fibroblasts display an increased sensitivity to camptothecin-induced cell death. treatment with menadione, an agent causing cell death by generating oxidative stress  <cit> , did not cause differences in survival between sma and control fibroblasts. in addition, camptothecin treatment resulted in significantly higher caspase- <dig> activity in sma fibroblasts when compared with control fibroblasts, and this activity directly correlated with levels of smn in fibroblasts. thus, these data support an active role for smn in cell survival.

camptothecin is a specific dna topoisomerase i inhibitor that binds dna topoisomerase i when the enzyme is complexed with dna  <cit> . consequently, camptothecin stabilizes the enzyme-dna complex and suppresses the enzymatic activity of this protein. camptothecin has been shown to induce cell death in human ovarian adenocarcinoma cells via p53-dependent and independent pathways  <cit> . interestingly, smn has been shown to interact with p <dig>  and this interaction is reduced when smn harbors mutations derived from sma patients  <cit> . because smn can interact with p <dig> and camptothecin can induce cell death via p53-dependent and independent mechanisms, this study addresses whether the increased sensitivity of sma fibroblasts to camptothecin occurs through a p53-dependent mechanism. we found that although smn directly interacts with p <dig>  the increased sensitivity of smn-depleted fibroblasts to camptothecin occurs through a p53-independent mechanism.

RESULTS
camptothecin inhibits dna unwinding but not kinase activity of dna topoisomerase i in human fibroblasts
we previously showed that fibroblasts derived from sma patients have increased sensitivity to the dna topoisomerase i inhibitor camptothecin  <cit> . dna topoisomerase i has been shown to phosphorylate sr proteins  <cit>  that regulate rna splicing. considering smn's role in rna splicing, we examined whether camptothecin treatment would block phosphorylation of sr proteins in sma fibroblasts. control and sma fibroblasts were treated with  <dig> μm camptothecin, and levels of phosphorylated sr proteins in nuclear extracts were analyzed by western blotting using the mab  <dig> antibody that specifically recognizes a phosphorylated epitope at the arginine/serine rich  domain  <cit> . as shown in figure 1a, levels of phosphorylated sr proteins were not reduced in camptothecin-treated human fibroblasts. in fact, phosphorylation of some sr proteins was slightly increased, which could be caused by activation of kinases other than dna topoisomerase i. these data suggest that camptothecin does not inhibit in vivo kinase activity of dna topoisomerase i. thus, the camptothecin-induced cell death in human fibroblasts must be mediated by suppression of other enzymatic activities of dna topoisomerase i.

next, we analyzed the dna relaxation activity of dna topoisomerase i from human fibroblasts after camptothecin treatment. control and sma fibroblasts were treated with  <dig> μm camptothecin, and dna topoisomerase i was immunoprecipitated. dna relaxation activity of this enzyme was assayed on a supercoiled plasmid dna  <cit> . figure 1b shows that in the absence of dna topoisomerase i, approximately half of the plasmid dna was found in the supercoiled form. upon addition of this enzyme, the majority of plasmid dna was in the relaxed form, and this dna relaxation activity was inhibited by camptothecin treatment. when immunoprecipitated dna topoisomerase i was mixed with camptothecin in vitro, dna relaxation activity of this enzyme was also reduced , which is consistent with data obtained from studies with purified dna topoisomerase i  <cit> . western blotting analyses indicated that upon camptothecin treatment, levels of dna topoisomerases i  in the immunoprecipitates and protein lysates were reduced by 80% or more, and sma fibroblasts had more reduced levels of this enzyme than control fibroblasts  . the reduction in dna topoisomerase i protein seems specific to camptothecin since another dna topoisomerase i inhibitor, β-lapachone, did not drastically affect levels of this enzyme . β-lapachone directly binds to dna topoisomerase i and inhibits its enzymatic activity  <cit> . thus, in vivo inhibition of dna topoisomerase i by camptothecin likely results from a combination of decreased dna relaxation activity and reduced levels of this protein.

activation of p <dig> and the sensitivity of sma fibroblasts to the dna topoisomerase i inhibitor β-lapachone
camptothecin has been shown to inhibit dna topoisomerase i activity by stabilizing the enzyme-dna cleavage complex  <cit> . as a result, camptothecin treatment results in single- and double-stranded dna breaks, causes g <dig> and g <dig> arrests, and leads to cell death via p53-dependent and independent pathways  <cit> . to elucidate whether the increased sensitivity of sma fibroblasts to camptothecin is p53-dependent, we assessed p <dig> induction after camptothecin treatment. as shown in figure 3a, levels of p <dig> were markedly increased upon camptothecin treatment, and this induction was seen as early as  <dig> h and was sustained for  <dig> h. treatment with menadione, which also induces death in fibroblasts but does not show differential sensitivity between control and sma fibroblasts  <cit> , did not elevate p <dig> levels . unlike camptothecin, menadione causes cell death by generating oxidative stress  <cit> . this suggested that p <dig> could play a role in the increased sensitivity of sma fibroblasts to camptothecin. to further address the role of p <dig> in camptothecin sensitivity, we examined the sensitivity of sma fibroblasts to another dna topoisomerase i inhibitor β-lapachone. this compound has been shown to induce cell death via a p53-independent pathway in several cancer cell lines  <cit> . figure 3c shows that levels of p <dig> protein were not elevated after β-lapachone treatment; and p <dig> levels actually decreased by more than 70% under this condition. note that under the same treatment conditions, levels of p <dig> were elevated two- to four-fold after camptothecin treatment. the sma fibroblasts showed no increased sensitivity to β-lapachone when compared with control fibroblasts using the percentage of cell death as the readout . these data imply that p <dig> plays a role in the increased sensitivity of sma fibroblasts to camptothecin.

association of p <dig> and smn in sma fibroblasts
since an interaction of p <dig> with smn has been previously reported  <cit> , we investigated whether p <dig> is associated with smn in fibroblasts. immunoprecipitation analyses of the endogenous p <dig> and smn proteins did not show an association , indicating that smn and p <dig> interaction in fibroblasts is likely transient and not stable. we next determined if a fraction of endogenous p <dig> and smn was associated by using confocal microscopy to test for co-localization. co-localization of these two proteins was confirmed by visualizing orthogonal projections of stacked images. control and sma fibroblasts were left untreated or treated with camptothecin, and p <dig> and smn proteins were detected by double-labeled immunofluorescence staining. as shown in figure 4a, both p <dig> and smn were localized in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. upon camptothecin treatment, p <dig> staining in the nucleus was dramatically enhanced, which is consistent with the p <dig> induction measured by western blotting analyses . nuclear immunofluorescence staining showed that smn was more concentrated in gems, and that sma fibroblasts had reduced numbers of gems in the nucleus both in the absence and presence of camptothecin treatment . gem size in sma fibroblasts was also smaller than that in control fibroblasts , likely as a result of reduced levels of smn expression in these cells. in addition, smn and p <dig> were seen to co-localize in gems in the absence and presence of camptothecin . overall, co-localization of smn with p <dig> was reduced in sma fibroblasts . for example, in the absence of camptothecin treatment, control fibroblasts had 99% gems with smn/p <dig> co-localization, whereas sma fibroblasts had 75%–83%. upon camptothecin treatment, both number of gems and percentage of gems with co-localized smn/p <dig> were reduced in control, type ii, and type iii sma fibroblasts. interestingly, type i sma fibroblasts had the fewest number of gems, but smn and p <dig> co-localized in almost all gems .

increased sensitivity of sma fibroblasts to camptothecin is p53-independent
having confirmed the association between smn and p <dig> in fibroblasts, we determined if the susceptibility of sma fibroblasts to camptothecin is mediated by p <dig>  endogenous p <dig> protein in fibroblasts was depleted by sirna, and the sensitivity of sma fibroblasts to camptothecin was analyzed. figures 5a and 5b showed a time course for p <dig> depletion by sirna in fibroblasts. a reduction of approximately 85–90% in p <dig> mrna levels was observed by addition of p <dig> sirna nucleotides at each time point analyzed . similarly, levels of the p <dig> protein were reduced by more than 90% in p <dig> sirna transfected cells . levels of p <dig> in non-targeting control and mock transfected cells were indistinguishable, indicating that p <dig> depletion by sirna is specific. moreover, upon camptothecin treatment, levels of p <dig> were markedly elevated in fibroblasts, and the increase in p <dig> expression upon camptothecin treatment was completely eliminated by p <dig> sirna . cell survival analyses indicated that sma fibroblasts were more sensitive to camptothecin than control fibroblasts  . surprisingly, depletion of p <dig> by sirna did not rescue either control or sma fibroblasts from camptothecin-induced cell death. figure 6a showed that cell death induced by camptothecin was not significantly reduced by p <dig> depletion. our previous study showed that sma fibroblasts have significantly higher caspase- <dig> activity upon camptothecin treatment than control fibroblasts  <cit> , thus we analyzed induction of camptothecin activated caspase- <dig> activity in p <dig> depleted fibroblasts after camptothecin treatment. figure 6b showed that p <dig> depletion indeed decreased camptothecin-induced parp cleavage, an in vivo caspase- <dig> substrate, in both control and sma fibroblasts. this is consistent with caspase- <dig> being downstream of p <dig>  <cit> . given that p <dig> depletion reduced caspase- <dig> activity but this was not enough to rescue fibroblasts from camptothecin-induced cell death, non-caspase- <dig> pathways could also be involved in camptothecin-induced death in sma fibroblasts. when these findings are taken together, we conclude that camptothecin-induced cell death in human fibroblasts is not p53-dependent, and p <dig> does not play a direct role in the increased sensitivity of sma fibroblasts to camptothecin.

discussion
the critical feature in the pathogenesis of sma is that reduced levels of the smn protein result in selective loss of motor neurons accompanied by muscle wasting. smn has been shown to play a role in the assembly of rnp complexes  <cit> , transcription regulation  <cit> , neurite outgrowth  <cit> , and cell survival  <cit> . however, how smn deficiency causes death of motor neurons and muscle paralysis with little effect on other cells and tissues remains unclear. previously, we demonstrated that sma fibroblasts are more sensitive to camptothecin-induced cell death when compared with control fibroblasts  <cit> , supporting a role for smn in cell survival. in this study, we further explored the potential mechanism underlying the susceptibility of sma fibroblasts to camptothecin.

camptothecin is a specific inhibitor of dna topoisomerase i. the best-characterized enzymatic activity of dna topoisomerase i is the relaxation of supercoiled dna during dna replication and rna synthesis  <cit> . camptothecin suppresses the dna relaxation activity of dna topoisomerase i by stabilizing the topoisomerase i-dna cleavage complex  <cit> . as a result, camptothecin treatment introduces single- and double-stranded dna breaks, leading to chromosome fragmentation and, eventually, cell death  <cit> . the action of camptothecin on the dna relaxation activity of dna topoisomerase i has been extensively characterized in vitro. here, we used immunoprecipitated dna topoisomerase i to analyze in vivo dna relaxation activity in camptothecin-treated human fibroblasts. we found that dna topoisomerase i from camptothecin-treated fibroblasts had decreased dna relaxation activity , which may be due to reduced levels of this protein and/or reduced enzymatic activity. a reduction in the levels of dna topoisomerase i in human fibroblasts after camptothecin treatment could be mediated by proteasome-dependent degradation as previously reported for some cancer cell lines  <cit> . interestingly, the reduced levels of dna topoisomerase i after camptothecin treatment were more pronounced in sma fibroblasts . in addition, in the absence of camptothecin, overall levels of dna topoisomerase i were lower in sma fibroblasts than control fibroblasts . thus, the lower levels of dna topoisomerase i in sma fibroblasts could account for their increased susceptibility to camptothecin. further experiments are needed to determine if the increased sensitivity of sma fibroblasts to camptothecin is due to lower levels of dna topoisomerase i in these cells. in addition to its dna relaxation activity, dna topoisomerase i exhibits a kinase activity that phosphorylates sr proteins  <cit> . since camptothecin treatment of sma fibroblasts did not result in reduced levels of phosphorylated sr proteins, camptothecin probably did not inhibit kinase activity of dna topoisomerase i in vivo. thus, inhibition of the dna relaxation activity of dna topoisomerase i by camptothecin likely accounts for its cytotoxicity in human fibroblasts.

in human ovarian adenocarcinoma cells, camptothecin has been shown to induce cell death via p53-dependent and independent pathways  <cit> . the present study showed that levels of p <dig> were markedly increased in sma fibroblasts upon camptothecin treatment . our data also confirmed previous findings  <cit>  in which a fraction of p <dig> co-localized with smn in gems, and this co-localization was overall decreased in sma fibroblasts . however, depletion of p <dig> by sirna did not lessen the susceptibility of sma fibroblasts to camptothecin . thus, although p <dig> is activated by camptothecin and p <dig> and smn can associate in vivo, p <dig> does not play a direct role in the increased sensitivity of smn-depleted fibroblasts to camptothecin. this agrees with a previous study performed in sma transgenic mice  <cit> . this study indicated that elimination of p <dig> does not alleviate the disease severity or extend overall lifespan in type i and type iii sma mice. thus, p53-independent apoptotic pathways may play a role in motor neuron loss when smn is depleted.

analyses of the sensitivity of sma fibroblasts to another dna topoisomerase i inhibitor, β-lapachone, indicate that sma and control fibroblasts showed similar sensitivity to this compound . β-lapachone is known to induce cell death in several cancer cell lines through a p53-independent pathway  <cit> . our data showed that this compound did not induce p <dig> in fibroblasts , suggesting that p <dig> is not involved in β-lapachone-induced cell death in fibroblasts. unlike camptothecin, β-lapachone directly binds to dna topoisomerase i and inhibits its enzymatic activity  <cit> . thus, β-lapachone treatment usually does not cause dna damage  <cit> . we noticed that β-lapachone did not induce a drastic reduction in the levels of dna topoisomerase i . since a reduction in dna topoisomerase i protein by camptothecin seems to be triggered by dna damage  <cit> , it is possible that β-lapachone did not cause dna damage in human fibroblasts, so levels of dna topoisomerase i protein remained unaltered after β-lapachone treatment. thus, the increased sensitivity of sma fibroblasts to camptothecin but not to β-lapachone suggests that cell death pathways activated by dna damage may be responsible for the susceptibility of sma fibroblasts to camptothecin. smn may protect fibroblasts from camptothecin-induced cell death through this pathway. this hypothesis is further supported by our observation that in addition to camptothecin, sma fibroblasts show an increased sensitivity to other dna damaging reagents . it will be interesting to find out whether other apoptotic molecules in this pathway such as bax play a role in the vulnerability of sma fibroblasts to camptothecin, since abolishing this apoptotic protein clearly protects sma mice from motor neuron loss  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our results confirm that p <dig> is activated by camptothecin in human fibroblasts. in addition, p <dig> co-localizes with smn in gems, and this co-localization is overall reduced in sma fibroblasts. however, p <dig> does not directly affect camptothecin sensitivity when smn is depleted.
