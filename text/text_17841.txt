BACKGROUND
during the last decade genetically-encoded sensors on the basis of fret  between fluorescent proteins have become popular instruments to study kinetics and localization of different pathways inside living cells  <cit> . however, their application is limited by relatively low dynamic range , which is limited, in its turn, by fret efficiency. in addition, spectral separation can be problematic due to pronounced cross-talks characteristic for the traditional cyan and yellow fret partners.

recent development of orange, red and far-red monomeric fluorescent proteins drastically enriched the palette of available genetically encoded fret pairs  <cit> . some of the novel combinations available can provide higher fret efficiency and more reliable spectral separation of the donor and acceptor fluorescence. shifting the wavelengths of fret pairs towards the red part of the spectrum reduces input of cellular autofluorescence and generally increases the fret efficiency due to increased r <dig> values  <cit> .

however, the choice of the best appropriate pair is not obvious, both due to the drawbacks found for some of the newly developed orange and red fluorescent proteins and due to unpredictable weak interactions between donor and acceptor, that can lead to enhanced or impaired fret, depending on the resulting orientation of chromophores. technical limitations of available microscopy software and hardware further complicate the choice. the lack of comparative information hampers development of fret-based applications and development of high contrast  fluorescent sensors, required for the sensitive studies of molecular biology of cell and for the reliable high throughput and high content screening assays  <cit> .

RESULTS
properties of the taggfp-tagrfp pair
in order to identify the preferable fret pair consisting of recently generated monomeric fluorescent proteins, we screened the palette of tag proteins . by directly comparing the amplitude of fluorescence before and after separation of fluorescent proteins , the taggfp-tagrfp pair demonstrated the highest dynamic range among tested fret pairs, and was further characterized in more detail.

taggfp  and tagrfp  <cit>  are bright monomeric fluorescent proteins with excitation/emission peaked at 482/ <dig> nm and 555/ <dig> nm, respectively. the high fluorescence quantum yield of taggfp along with the high molar extinction coefficient of tagrfp and excellent overlap of donor emission and acceptor excitation spectra result in highly effective fret . the förster radius  for fret between taggfp and tagrfp is  <dig>  nm, being significantly higher than that of the taggfp-mcherry couple of  <dig>  nm. at the same time, since taggfp and tagrfp emission peaks are spaced by as much as  <dig> nm, the emission signal for these two proteins can be reliably separated in any imaging system. high ph-stability  makes this pair a reliable ph-independent reporter, and allows to employ it for imaging in acidic organelles.

the excitation wavelength required to visualize fret changes of the taggfp/tagrfp pair by ratio-imaging is provided by an ordinary fitc/gfp excitation filter or ubiquitous  <dig> nm laser line, and the two emission signals are acquired using a 500– <dig> nm  bandpass filter and a 560– <dig> nm bandpass filter  or a 560lp longpass filter, or the like. as can be inferred from fig. 1a, the direct acceptor  excitation at  <dig> nm is marginal, giving rise to an almost pure donor  emission spectrum in the absence of fret .

caspase  <dig> sensor
on the basis of this pair of fluorescent proteins we generated a bright, high contrast, ph- and photo-stable fret-based apoptosis reporter, named casper <dig> , constructed of tagrfp and taggfp connected via  <dig> a.a. peptide linker containing caspase-3-cleavable motif devd  <cit>  .

the construct was expressed in e. coli and demonstrated bright fluorescence after overnight growth at 37°c and purification. further incubation of a sample did not led to essential changes of fluorescence spectra or brightness, indicating profound maturation of both proteins. the cleavage of a sensor by activated form of the caspase  <dig> resulted in separation of two fluorescent proteins and elimination of fret. direct monitoring of the donor/acceptor emission ratio demonstrated up to 5-fold ratio changes upon cleavage of casper <dig> by recombinant caspase  <dig> in vitro . the increase in donor fluorescence intensity was at least 2-fold corresponding to a fret efficiency of at least 50%. subsequently, we tested casper <dig> responsiveness in transiently transfected hela cells. living cells were monitored at 37°c with leica sp <dig> confocal microscope . the fluorescence was evenly distributed in the cytosol and nucleus with no aggregation or non-specific localization observed. importantly, both green and red signals were reliably stable upon blue excitation in various irradiation conditions for hours. no reversible or irreversible fluorescence bleaching or photoconversion were observed.

apoptosis was induced by treatment with  <dig> μm staurosporine  approximately 40– <dig> min after staurosporine infusion , cells demonstrated rapid  and pronounced changes in green-to-red fluorescence signal ratio, indicating activation of caspase  <dig>  later these cells demonstrated characteristic membrane blebbing. the average contrast in living cells  reached  <dig> -fold .

flim
one of the most powerful and quantitative approaches to measure fret changes is fluorescence lifetime imaging , which measures the effect of the acceptor on the excited state lifetime of the donor. if the acceptor is in close proximity, the lifetime is reduced. the reduction of the fluorescence lifetime is a kinetic parameter that can be determined independently of probe concentration, microscope optical path and moderate levels of photobleaching. therefore, the reduction of the donor lifetime is an extremely robust and quantitative estimate of fret efficiency that is directly proportional to the amount of uncleaved substrate. we performed flim measurements of the non-fused taggfp and the taggfp within the casper <dig> sensor in living cells. these experiments demonstrated substantial differences in the detected fluorescence lifetimes . accordingly, upon staurosporine-induced apoptosis, fluorescence lifetime of taggfp within casper <dig> changed dramatically, switching from  <dig>  ns to  <dig>  ns .

the fret efficiency of the uncleaved casper <dig>  is among the highest measured by flim and compares favorably to a red-to-green caspase sensor reported previously, with a fret efficiency of 25%  <cit> . since the fret efficiency of the cleaved substrate is zero, the dynamic range of the sensor is rather high, indicating that taggfp-tagrfp fret pair will be an excellent tool for the high content flim based screenings on living cells.

CONCLUSIONS
most reported fret indicators are based on historically first cfp/yfp pairs  <cit> . however, these fret pairs are not really the most convenient and effective. indeed, spectral separation of overlapping cyan and yellow emission spectra can never be complete, and use of narrow band-pass filters results in dramatic loss of emission. besides, the relative high levels of autofluorescence in blue-cyan region of visible spectrum and phototoxicity using near-uv excitation further complicates their application.

reported fret pairs containing red fluorescent acceptors suffer from tetramerization and demonstrate lower contrast  <cit> . the closest competitor of casper <dig> is a high contrasting caspase- <dig> indicator micy-mko  <cit> , however, it was observed that mko converts from orange to green fluorescent form upon blue light illumination  <cit> , that can hamper interpretation of fret changes in this and other mko-based techniques.

the high extinction coefficient of tagrfp makes it a preferable fret acceptor for the green fluorescent proteins. it is of note that the actual fret efficiency is an inverse 6th power distance dependency, leading to a quick drop of the detected fret efficiency at donor-acceptor proximities above r <dig>  for instance, under similar conditions, we expect that, given the förster radii  <dig>  nm and  <dig>  nm for taggfp-mcherry and taggfp-tagrfp respectively, the latter would display  <dig> -fold more fret than a sensor comprised of the taggfp-mcherry pair.

the superior förster radius is caused by an  <dig> -fold increased spectral overlap for the taggfp-tagrfp pair as compared to the taggfp-mcherry pair. while not contributing to the fret efficiency, the significantly increased quantum yield of tagrfp is highly beneficial for acceptor-based ratiometric fret studies.

altogether, the combined advantages of the taggfp-tagrfp make it the fret pair of choice both for the ratiometric fret analyses and flim assays to monitor interaction of proteins of interest in living cells, as well as to generate high contrast fret-based genetically encoded sensors for various analites and protein activities.
