BACKGROUND
the gilthead sea bream  is a marine teleost that belongs to the family sparidae. sparids are of great importance for fisheries and aquaculture, being excellent food fish, with high commercial value s. aurata is one of the most prominent, with an average cultured production of  <dig> million metric tonnes per year. the great importance of the gilthead sea bream for marine aquaculture has fuelled an increasing number of studies in many different areas such as immunology, endocrinology, bone morphology, and muscle physiology. furthermore, the genomic toolkit for this species has been constantly improving in the recent years. a first generation cdna microarray was recently reported  <cit> , a radiation hybrid  map has been constructed  <cit>  and further improved with over  <dig>  markers  <cit> . a medium density genetic linkage map is already available  <cit> , a second generation linkage map is being constructed , and a bac-end sequencing project is underway .

despite great achievements in marine fish culture, severe bottlenecks still remain . to overcome these limitations, important gaps need to be filled in the basic knowledge of biology for aquacultured species. a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying key productive traits  holds the promise to revolutionize animal farming, leading to improved programs of genetic breeding and highly effective means to monitor the effects of husbandry conditions on farmed animals. functional genomics, i.e. a "whole-genome" approach to the study of interactions between genes and environment, offers unprecedented opportunities to achieve such a goal. not surprisingly, relevant "genomic" research programs have been launched for all the most important livestock species. large collections of ests have been produced , and technical platforms for functional genomics, based on dna microarrays are now available . with respect to farmed fish, only recently large sequencing efforts led the improvement of est collections for several species such as atlantic salmon  <cit> , rainbow trout  <cit> , atlantic cod, atlantic halibut  <cit> , channel and blue catfish  <cit> , largemouth bass  <cit> , and fathead minnow  <cit> . such large collections of sequence data cannot be fully exploited to develop functional genomic tools using the traditional cdna microarray technology.

even neglecting other technical limitations, cdna arrays require to be produced that all the clones to be spotted onto the slide are physically available at a single location. this often led to the construction of cdna microarrays that provided only a partial representation of the species transcriptome, focused to restricted research goals  <cit> . furthermore, ultra-high throughput dna sequencing technologies , which can now produce up to one million ests in a single run  <cit> , do not use individual bacterial clones as sequencing material. therefore, amplifying and spotting cdna clones is not possible anymore. oligo_dna arrays have long offered an alternative approach to cdna arrays, allowing the representation of all the expressed sequences that are available for the target species. oligonucleotide probes of variable length  can be either synthesized individually and then spotted onto the slide or directly synthesized in situ. until recently, a large economic investment was associated with the development of oligo-dna arrays as a consequence of the cost of individual oligo synthesis or the development of a specific photolithographic mask . the advent of different technologies  that allow flexible in situ probe synthesis has made affordable the development of high-density oligo-dna microarrays also in non-model species. in fact, this year two generations of oligo-dna microarrays, based on short  probes have been developed for ictalurid catfish using nimblegen technology  <cit> ; parallel synthesis technology has been used to fabricate a high-density dna microarray for atlantic halibut  <cit> , while agilent sureprint™ technology has been applied to produce platforms, different both in size and probe-length, for the fathead minnow  <cit> , the largemouth bass  <cit> , and the rainbow trout  <cit> . a low-density oligo-dna microarray  has been tested also for the atlantic salmon  <cit> . in the present study, we used all the available ests from the gilthead sea bream to design two longer  probes for each transcript in-situ synthesized on glass slides using agilent sureprint™ technology. this microarray platform was then validated to assess its reproducibility and accuracy on two early stages of gilthead sea bream development, respectively one-day and four days old larvae.

RESULTS
sapd data base
a total of  <dig>  ests plus  <dig> sea bream mrna sequences publicly available in genbank were clustered together. the number of unique clusters was  <dig> . contigs formed by two or more ests were  <dig> , while singletons were  <dig> . the relevant number of singletons is likely due to two factors. first, highly stringent criteria were enforced during the assembly process  in order to avoid the assembly of concatamers. second, only normalized cdna libraries were used to produce the vast majority of clustered ests, this determined a few number of contigs compared to singletons. the annotation process identified  <dig>  clusters with a significant similarity to a known gene. to a large proportion of contigs it was also possible to associate a go entry, either for biological process  or cellular component  or molecular function  . a total of  <dig>  clusters encode a putative protein with one or more known pfam domains. all sequence data with associated annotations are stored in a dedicated data base , which is freely accessible. the data base is based on the biomart environment, which allows several options for data mining and retrieval. a local blast search is also implemented.

microarray analysis
probe design was positively completed for  <dig>  target clusters. of these,  <dig>  were represented by two non-overlapping probes, for  <dig> it was possible to design only one probe. a total of  <dig>  target probes were then synthesized directly onto the glass slide. the majority of designed probes  had the highest quality score ,  <dig> % were scored as bc <dig>  the remaining ones  had bc <dig> or bc <dig> scores, none showed the lowest score .

the quality of each probe included on the array was then assessed for hybridization success considering a total of  <dig> experiments . hybridizations resulting in a "present" flag using the agilent feature extraction  <dig> . <dig> software were considered successful. only five probes  never showed higher signal than background, while  <dig> , corresponding to 95% of the total number of target probes, successfully hybridized in at least five array experiments .

one of the most important requirements for a microarray experiment is good system reproducibility, which ensures that results from different experiments can be directly and reliably compared. four technical replicates of the same experiment were performed in order to evaluate the repeatability and precision of the experimental protocol and of the array platform. raw expression data were filtered according to missing spot intensities per probe. probes with more than one missing spot across the four replicates were removed from the analysis . after data filtering and cyclic lowess normalization, the degree of mutual agreement among replicates was estimated using pearson correlation coefficients on the entire set of expression values. for all pairs of experiments correlation coefficients were always significant  and never less than  <dig>  . this underlines the high level of repeatability for this array platform. the % coefficients of variation  of the normalized signals at the feature level were measured across non-control probes of the four replicated microarray. median %cv was  <dig> %, and less than 15% of the probes had a cv over 30% .

as for technical replicates, raw expression data derived from the comparison of the two s. aurata developmental stages, were filtered according to missing spot intensity. probes with more than two missing values across the biological replicates of each developmental stage were removed from the analysis . then, cyclic lowess was used to normalize the data. the gilthead sea bream microarray platform is characterised by the presence of two probes for each transcript. these two probes match the gene sequence at two non-overlapping positions. in particular, the first probe was designed to be closer to the 3' of each target gene. the variability between the two probes for the same transcript was assessed using fold change as measure of signal difference. such comparisons are expected to yield a fold change close or equal to zero. in figure  <dig> each plot shows the distribution of observed fold-changes between probe_ <dig> and probe_ <dig> for individual array experiments. as expected, the difference between the intensities of the two probes for the same gene displays a symmetrical distribution centred on zero and equal across all the experiments. with the exception of a few cases, most probe pairs are characterised by a small difference in terms of intensity values. to evaluate the degree of concordance for expression values of probe pairs, a correlation analysis was carried out. for each gene, the pearson correlation coefficient was calculated within and among arrays. within arrays the total expression values of probe_ <dig> and probe_ <dig> showed a correlation coefficient always greater than  <dig> . on the other hand, the correlation among arrays was evaluated using, respectively, vectors of probe_ <dig> and probe_ <dig> expression values across all ten experiments. the distribution of correlation coefficients  indicates that most probes  have a strong positive correlation , 11% show a moderate correlation , while only a small proportion of probes are negatively correlated , some of them  with a strong negative correlation, r < - <dig> ).

a microarray platform should also cover a wide dynamic range to detect/quantify both rare and abundant genes in the same experiment. sensitivity and dynamic range of the platform were measured using the spike-in control probes. spike-in mix contains a mixture of  <dig> in vitro synthesized, poly-adenilated transcripts, derived from adenovirus e1a gene, at concentrations that span six logs . when the signal intensity  for each spike-in transcript is plotted against the log of the relative concentration, the linear range can be calculated based on parametric curve-fit through the data. the lower limit of detection  of the microarray experiments was estimated using the lowest intensity probe within the linear range. in all experiments a large dynamic range was observed with linear increase in signal intensity across  <dig>  orders of magnitude, and a lower lld of  <dig>  pg/μl . the transcript with the lowest concentration  was always out of the linear range due to its extremely low signal intensity.

a two class sam test  <cit>  was performed to identify differentially expressed genes between developmental stages  <dig> and  <dig>  with a false discovery rate  equal to zero. this produced a list of  <dig>   significant probes corresponding to  <dig>  unique genes. for  <dig> out of  <dig>  genes both probe_ <dig> and probe_ <dig> resulted differentially expressed after sam analysis while the remaining  <dig> genes were represented by only one probe. for  <dig> genes  identified by a single probe the other one was previously excluded in the filtering step. transcripts that were up-regulated in stage  <dig> compared to stage  <dig> were  <dig> , while down-regulated genes were  <dig> . a preliminary annotation was available respectively for  <dig>  up-regulated genes, whereas a significantly larger proportion  of down-regulated genes was associated with an annotation  . a go definition of the biological process associated with the encoded protein was obtained for  <dig>  of down-regulated transcripts. of these,  <dig> are involved in dna replication or repair, chromatin assembly, and cell cycle regulation, while  <dig> are part of protein synthesis/maturation  or protein catabolism  processes. the third most represented group is lipid transport and metabolism . conversely, only  <dig>  up-regulated genes are associated with a go definition of biological process. the most represented group  contains proteases with various functions, e.g. digestive enzymes  or antigen processing peptidases . signal transduction is the second most frequent process, with  <dig> entries. noteworthy are two proteins involved in phototransduction  and the nuclear receptor for glucocorticoids . other go biological process categories with fewer entries are "metabolic process" with  <dig> entries, mostly consisting of carbohydrate processing enzymes, and "transport"  with transporters/channels for diverse molecules . a single entry  was present for "immune response", a crucial biological process for larval survival.

raw and normalized fluorescence data have been deposited in the geo data base under accession numbers gsm <dig>  gsm <dig>  gsm <dig>  gsm <dig> .

real-time rt-pcr analysis
to cross-validate platform performance, gene-specific quantitative qrt-pcr assays, designed using the universal probe library  system, were used. target genes for qrt-pcr analysis were selected according to the following selection criteria. selected genes  should reflect the whole range of fold-change values   should equally represent up-regulated and down-regulated gene lists,  should be present with both independent probes in the normalized data set. table  <dig> shows fold-changes detected by gene-specific pcr assay and by both microarray probes  for the same target transcript. fold-change was calculated as the ratio of mean signal intensity across five biological replicates between stage  <dig> and stage  <dig>  for all tested targets, the direction of change in expression was concordant between qrt-pcr and microarray results. good concordance between qrt-pcr and microarray data was observed when fold-change values ranged between  <dig> and  <dig>  when the fold-change calculated from microarray data was higher than  <dig>  qrt-pcr estimated substantially larger changes in gene-expression . overall, a statistically significant correlation was obtained comparing expression levels for each target gene across all biological replicates. six genes showed high correlation coefficients  for both probes  with qpcr data . other four genes had a significant correlation . only one gene, pgk <dig>  presented a not significant, albeit positive correlation  for one probe, and no correlation for the other one .

a fold change is calculated as ratio of stage  <dig> vs stage  <dig>  using mean signal intensity across five biological replicates of each stage. values below  <dig>  indicate down-regulation in stage  <dig>

discussion
the aim of the present work was to develop an integrated platform for mrna expression profiling in the gilthead sea bream. the first step was the construction of a data base of unique transcripts clustering all publicly available mrna sequences and > <dig>  expressed sequence tags  originating from a medium-scale est sequencing project, which had been recently completed, within the framework of the network of excellence marine genomics europe. the number of unique clusters obtained is similar to what reported for comparable est collections in other fish species/stages . approximately 40% of these unique transcripts found a significant similarity with at least one annotated gene/protein present in public data bases , in agreement with the percentage of annotated clusters for the largemouth bass , and slightly lower than the value observed for the pre-smolt atlantic salmon , the atlantic halibut , and the channel catfish . on the other hand, a sufficiently high number of sea bream transcripts could be associated with a go entry, potentially allowing for the functional analysis of differentially expressed genes. the relatively low number of annotated expressed sequences appears to be a major limitation of most est sequencing projects in commercial fish, even in those species where the transcriptome has been characterized in greater depth. however, the percentage of annotated transcripts is expected to increase substantially in the near future, when additional draft sequences of fish genomes  will become available. further sequence information for comparative analysis will also arise from the application of ultra-high throughput dna sequencing technologies to est production in non-model species.

the relatively small number of ests available for s. aurata did not seems to affect significantly the efficiency of probe design, as for most clusters two non-overlapping probes could be successfully designed. moreover, for most target sequences a strong correlation was reported between probe-pairs. only for  <dig> transcripts  probe_ <dig> and probe_ <dig> showed a negative correlation. several different factors can account for such observation. first, alternative splicing could produce differentially expressed transcripts for the same gene; such a difference can then be revealed by the use of two independent probes per gene. second, a greater stability of the 3'-end of some transcript might reduce the signal for the 5'-end probe. however, this seems not to be a general phenomenon because no significant bias was observed between 3'-end probes and 5'-end ones. finally, high sequence similarity across different genes  might lead to the widely documented problem of probe cross-hybridization or to spurious est clusters in consequence of assembly errors.

before normalization and statistical analysis, data for 12% of the total number of probes were removed, following a very stringent criterion . such filtering step was performed to maximize the probability of detecting real differences in gene expression at the expense of some loss of information. detailed analysis of filtered-out probes shows that 60% of excluded probes in stage  <dig> were detected in stage  <dig>  and vice versa 65% of missing spots in stage  <dig> were present in stage  <dig>  this observation suggests that differential expression between ontogenetic phases rather than poor probe quality might explain why a relatively large number of probes were excluded. it should also be noted that experimental samples represented two early larval stages, where a certain number of "adult-only" genes might not be expressed at all. finally, both probes  were excluded from the analysis only for less than 4% of all genes . for the majority of transcripts either one  or two probes  yielded a positive signal in all experiments. this clearly suggests that a "safe" approach in microarray design should incorporate at least two probes per gene.

repeatability of microarray data, across either technical or biological replicates, appeared to be quite high and not influenced by the presently limited knowledge of the sea bream transcriptome. good repeatability for the agilent and other oligo-array platforms was already reported in a large initiative on microarray quality  <cit> . the results obtained here further confirm this evidence. in the maqc evaluation single- and two-colour designs were compared  <cit> . this comparison indicated that data quality is essentially equivalent between the one- and two-color approaches and strongly suggested that this variable need not be a primary factor in decisions regarding experimental microarray design. repeatability was extremely good also in the case of the gilthead sea bream array . the use of just one dye  allows for a simplified experimental design and easier comparison across different experiments. at the same time, labeling with only cy <dig> is less expensive and it reduces the risk of ozone-mediated dye degradation, as cy <dig> is more sensitive to this ubiquitous contaminant. a single color scheme, however, requires a highly efficient signal normalization across experiments. based on the comparison of spike-in probe signal between arrays after normalization, cyclic lowess was found to be superior to quantile normalization, and to outperform averaging with median fluorescence value, which is the method suggested by agilent for one-color array experiments . this result is in agreement with evidence reported for other array platforms  <cit> . in the agilent array technology, the simplicity and economy of a single color design is coupled with the flexibility of programmable in-situ synthesis of oligonucleotide probes. this feature is extremely important especially for non-model species, where the knowledge of the transcriptome is often substantially incomplete. a flexible array design can accommodate the elimination of unsuitable probes and, more importantly, the subsequent inclusion of additional probes as soon as novel unique transcripts are identified.

the quality of the gilthead sea bream oligo-microarray data was also confirmed after qrt-pcr validation of expression results for selected target genes. the use of qrt-pcr for cross-validation of microarray data is generally limited to the most significant differentially expressed genes. in the present study, genes were selected for validation across the entire range of absolute signal intensity and fold-change. although this approach cannot substitute for systematic qpcr analysis of all target genes as reported in other studies  <cit> , it should provide a less biased comparison between microarray- and rt-pcr-technology. in the case of the gilthead sea bream oligo-array, a highly significant positive correlation was observed when comparing individual expression values, further confirming the reliability of the gilthead sea bream array platform. pgk <dig> was the only exception. for this gene, a positive, but not significant correlation was observed only between results of probe_ <dig> and qrt-pcr data. this is likely due to the small difference in expression between the two sample groups . lack of correlation between microarray and qrt-pcr for genes exhibiting low levels of change  has been commonly reported. indeed usually a two-fold change is considered as the cut-off below which microarray and qrt-pcr data begin to loose correlation  <cit> . plotting microarray-estimated fold-changes against qrt-pcr results  also showed the occurrence of fold-change compression for differences in expression value above one order of magnitude. this is, however, a well-known phenomenon, due to various technical limitations, including limited dynamic range, signal saturations, and cross-hybridizations of microarrays  <cit> .

as mentioned above, the main focus of the present study was the construction and validation of a microarray platform for the gilthead sea bream. nevertheless, significant results on the biological process of gilthead sea bream early development were obtained. it should be remarked here that the expression levels of target genes obtained in the present work reflect a mixture of cell types and tissues, as whole larvae were analyzed. thus, the variation in expression observed in the comparison between stage  <dig> and  <dig> might represent changes in the proportion of different tissues during development rather than changes in specific levels of transcription of target genes. furthermore, absence of variation in expression may represent the cancelling out of variations in different tissues of opposite signal. indeed, genes down-regulated in the transition between 1-day old and 4-days old larvae mainly belong to "essential"  biological processes such as dna replication, cell cycle, and protein synthesis or catabolism. it is therefore likely that as tissue- and cell-differentiation proceeds cell-type and tissue-type specific transcripts start to be produced, leading to a "dilution" of mrnas encoding housekeeping proteins. a similar effect might cause the observed down-regulation of proteins involved in lipid metabolism, which is essential for cellular and sub-cellular membrane biosynthesis. on the other hand, in stage  <dig> larvae the yolk sac is reduced to one-eighth of its original size, with a corresponding reduction in the contribution of yolk lipids as nutrients. thus, the reduced abundance of mrnas encoding proteins associated with lipid metabolic processes could actually reflect a transition toward autonomous feeding. in 4-days old larvae mouth opening is initiated, the digestive system is formed, with a lengthened intestine and a pancreatic gland anlage. in keeping with this evidence, digestive enzymes such as elastase, as already reported by sarropoulou and colleagues  <cit> , and two different isoforms of chymotrypsinogen  begin to appear in the list of up-regulated transcripts. four-days old larvae also start to show a pigmented eye, as mirrored by the expression of green-sensitive opsin and other eye-specific genes .

myogenesis is well underway in early larval stages. the differentiation of embryonic and larval muscle fibres involves a complex temporal sequence of gene activation  <cit>  that includes structural and contractile proteins  as well as soluble muscle proteins and enzymes . unfortunately, little is known on the temporal and spatial organization of gene expression for the maturation and diversification of fish embryonic muscle cells.

in the present study high expression levels of the myogenic regulatory factor myod have been detected in both stage  <dig> and stage  <dig> larvae. similarly, transcritps encoding proteins involved in muscle contraction such as myosin light chain  <dig>  parvalbumin, tropomyosin, and sarcomeric creatine kinase  are abundantly expressed. the latter shows strong up-regulation in stage  <dig>  thus confirming previous findings on the constant increase of ckm expression from the embryo to the adult  <cit> . differences of gene expression have been detected also for tropomyosin, increasing in expression as the embryos get older, while myosin and parvalbumin show a weak up-regulation  in stage  <dig> compared to stage  <dig>  when the larvae has just hatched, as already reported by sarropoulou and colleagues  <cit> . finally, stromal cell derived-factor, a molecule promoting early myogenic differentiation of external cell precursors  <cit> , appears to be down-regulated in stage  <dig> compared to stage  <dig> 

more in general, signal transduction is a well represented biological process among up-regulated genes, indicating an increasing importance of intra-cellular signaling pathways in parallel with tissue- and cell-differentiation. in some cases, the appearance of specific pathways seems to precede that of the corresponding anatomical organs. for instance, the glucocorticoid receptor is up-regulated in agreement with a functional hypothalamus-pituitary-interrenal axis at an early stage  <cit>  and suggesting a role of glucocorticoids in early development. the shift from "essential" transcripts toward tissue- and cell-specific ones might also explain the highly significant bias in the percentage of annotated/unknown transcripts between up-regulated and down-regulated genes. a low frequency  of annotated clusters among up-regulated transcripts in stage  <dig> larvae was observed when compared to down-regulated ones . cluster annotation was based essentially on sequence similarity, therefore sea bream transcripts from highly conserved genes are more likely to find a significant match with known sequences from other taxa. a correlation between sequence conservation and protein function/tissue-distribution/expression has been the focus of several studies  <cit> . it seems, at least in mammals, that essential genes  or housekeeping genes  evolve significantly slower than non-essential or tissue-specific genes. these two categories do not necessarily coincide, but there is a substantial overlapping. in the case of gilthead sea bream expression data, the transition between stage  <dig> and stage  <dig> larvae represents an increase in tissue- and cell-types with a correspondingly larger proportion of tissue- and cell-specific transcripts. this likely translates into a higher share of essential/housekeeping genes in stage  <dig> than in stage  <dig>  as already evident from go biological process entries associated with up-regulated and down-regulated genes. since a significantly higher number of down-regulated transcripts shows a meaningful similarity with putative homologs in other species, it seems likely that essential/housekeeping genes evolve more slowly in the gilthead sea bream as well. thus, similar selective processes appear to shape the evolution of protein-encoding genes in both lower and higher vertebrates.

CONCLUSIONS
a highly reliable oligo-microarray platform could be developed and validated for the sea bream despite the presently limited knowledge of the species transcriptome. strong reproducibility was achieved, and microarray data could be cross-validated using an independent method . while usable as it is, because of its flexible design this type of array will be able in the future to accommodate additional probes as soon as novel unique transcripts are identified. finally, the approach followed here can be extended to any species of interest, especially in conjunction with est production based on next-generation sequencing. together with similar studies carried out in other fish, the present work demonstrates that the development of flexible and reliable array platforms is feasible in any important aquaculture species with a limited investment. the possibility to analyze global gene expression profiles under different environmental conditions will lead to a better understanding of the influence of nutrition, stress, and disease on aquaculture production.
