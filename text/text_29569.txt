BACKGROUND
aquaporin- <dig>  is a water-selective channel expressed in plasma membranes of astrocytes throughout the central nervous system , particularly at astrocyte foot processes at the blood-brain barrier and brain-cerebrospinal fluid interfaces  <cit> . aqp <dig> facilitates water movement in the brain and spinal cord, astrocyte migration, and neuroexcitatory phenomena . mice lacking aqp <dig> manifest remarkable phenotype differences from wildtype mice in models of cytotoxic  <cit>  and vasogenic  <cit>  cerebral edema, brain injury associated with glial scarring  <cit> , epilepsy  <cit>  and cortical spreading depression  <cit> . structural data on aqp <dig> from electron crystallography suggested a possible new role of aqp <dig> in cell-cell adhesion  <cit> , though subsequent experimental studies did not confirm this role  <cit> .

another potential new role for aqp <dig> that is unrelated to its cell membrane water transport function was suggested by the discovery of circulating autoantibodies against aqp <dig> in most patients with the inflammatory demyelinating disease neuromyelitis optica   <cit> . indirect evidence, including correlations of nmo-igg titer with disease severity, and clinical benefit of plasmapheresis and immunosuppression, has suggested that nmo-igg causes nmo . how circulating nmo-igg and cns aqp <dig> expression promote inflammation and cause demyelinating lesions in the central nervous system is the subject of intense speculation. recently, increased aqp <dig> expression was found in brain and spinal cord in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis , providing further support for the possible involvement of aqp <dig> in cns inflammation  <cit> .

motivated by the potential involvement of aqp <dig> in an inflammatory demyelinating cns disease, we investigated the role of aqp <dig> in eae using a well-established mouse model of eae produced by immunization with a peptide against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein   <cit> . studies were done comparing clinical outcome and cns histology in wildtype vs. aqp <dig> knockout mice, which have normal brain microanatomy, blood-brain barrier integrity, and baseline intracranial pressure  <cit> . we found remarkably less severe eae in mice lacking aqp <dig>  providing evidence for a novel role of aqp <dig> in neuroinflammation.

RESULTS
eae was induced in wildtype and aqp <dig> null mice in a c57/bl <dig> genetic background by immunization with mog35– <dig> peptide. most wildtype mice developed progressive tail and hindlimb weakness, generally seen by  <dig> days after the initial immunization, and progressing in some mice to complete hindlimb paralysis. in contrast, the aqp <dig> null mice did not develop clinical signs except for transient tail weakness in one mog-treated aqp <dig> null mouse. control wildtype and aqp <dig> null mice, which were identically treated except for exclusion of mog peptide, did not develop clinical signs. fig. 1a shows photographs of two mog-treated wildtype and two aqp <dig> null mice, demonstrating tail and hindlimb weakness in the wildtype mice. a movie showing the difference is provided . fig. 1b summarizes the clinical scores, which were assessed without knowledge of genotype information, showing remarkably attenuated eae clinical signs in the aqp <dig> null mice. fig. 1c shows similar body weights of mog-treated wildtype and aqp <dig> null mice, and control mice.

to verify that wildtype and aqp <dig> null mice responded appropriately to the mog immunizations, the right hindpaws of a subset of mice were injected with  <dig> μg mog35– <dig> at  <dig> days after the initial immunization, according to standard procedure  <cit> . marked and comparable swelling was seen in the mog-treated wildtype and aqp <dig> null mice, with no swelling seen in control mice .

spinal cord and brains of mog-treated and control mice were assessed at  <dig> days after initial mog immunization. fig. 2a  shows hematoxylin and eosin staining of spinal cord of mog-treated wildtype and aqp <dig> null mice. mononuclear cell infiltrates were consistently seen in mog-treated wildtype mice, but were infrequent or absent in aqp <dig> null mice . fig. 2a  summarizes histological scores obtained from assessment of sections from all mice by two investigators who were blinded to genotype and treatment information. a very significant difference was found. fig. 2b shows immunohistochemistry for the lymphocyte marker cd <dig>  the positive staining of mononuclear cell infiltrates confirms their cellular identity as lymphocytes. fig. 2c shows staining for myelin by luxol fast blue. all mog-treated wildtype mice showed multiple areas of myelin loss in white mater of spinal cord, with remarkably fewer or no areas of myelin loss in mog-treated aqp <dig> null mice.

immunofluorescence with anti-nf <dig> antibody revealed axonal loss in white mater in lesions containing cell infiltrates where reduced myelin staining was seen .

gfap and aqp <dig> immunofluorescence is shown in fig.  <dig>  aqp <dig> expression was seen mainly in gfap-positive astrocytes in control wildtype mice. eae induction in wildtype mice produced increased gfap and aqp <dig> expression around lesions , but near absence of gfap and aqp <dig> immunofluorescence within lesions. aqp <dig> immunofluorescence was absent in aqp <dig> null mice, as expected, though there was often seen a mild increase in gfap immunofluorescence.

fig. 4a shows representative hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections of brain  and a summary of histological scores . as in spinal cord sections, clearly more mononuclear cell infiltration was seen in the mog-treated wildtype mice. the cell infiltrates in brain were cd <dig> positive , as seen in spinal cord.

discussion
our data show marked attenuation in the severity of eae in mice lacking aqp <dig>  the reduced clinical severity, with virtual absence of clinical signs, is consistent with the reduced inflammatory cell infiltration in brain and spinal cord of aqp <dig> null mice. whether aqp <dig> is similarly involved in other neuroinflammatory diseases of the cns is unknown. we previously reported improved clinical outcome in a mouse model of bacterial meningitis, with greatly reduced meningeal inflammation  <cit> , though it was not possible to isolate effects of aqp <dig> on inflammation versus brain water accumulation and intracranial pressure elevation. the eae model here is not associated with significant brain swelling or intracranial pressure elevation.

the mechanisms are not known by which aqp <dig> expression is associated with increased inflammation in eae. the association of nmo with aqp <dig> autoantibodies suggests the possibility of a local inflammatory response involving aqp <dig>  whether an immune response directly against aqp <dig> occurs in eae is not known, nor is it known whether aqp <dig> expression might exacerbate the astrocyte response to injury because of increased cell swelling and delayed k+ uptake from the extracellular space. another possibility, based on aqp <dig> biology, is local alterations in brain water content in the region of the inflammatory lesions. other possible mechanisms include aqp4-dependent differences in the concentrations of excitatory neurotransmitters, in astrocyte activation and migration, and in inflammatory cell movement into lesions across the blood-brain barrier and brain parenchyma. investigation of these possibilities will likely present a considerable challenge.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our studies implicate aqp <dig> as a novel determinant of the severity of eae. the increased aqp <dig> expression reported in eae around inflammatory lesions likely amplifies the response in a positive feedback manner, increasing the difference in response between wildtype and aqp <dig> null mice. as such, compounds that interfere with the upregulated expression of aqp <dig>  or perhaps that reduce aqp <dig> function or plasma membrane expression, may be of clinical benefit in selected neuroinflammatory diseases of the cns.
