BACKGROUND
in mammals, the pkc family consists of at least  <dig> serine/threonine kinases grouped into three subfamilies attending to their regulatory domain and requirements for their activation. unlike conventional pkcs, novel pkcs , such as pkcδ, are not dependent on calcium but on diacylglycerol to change from their self-inhibited state to their active conformation  <cit> . pkcδ activity can be regulated in different manners, including phosphorylation of its activation loop by kinases  <cit>  and by autophosphorylation of different sites throughout its regulatory domain and hinge region  <cit> . in addition, it can become a lipid-independent enzyme with altered substrate specificity under certain conditions  <cit>  and show altered cofactor requirements  <cit> . pkcδ interacts with different proteins, such as shc  <cit>  or p <dig>  <cit> , and in its active state is able to phosphorylate different substrates, such as stats  <cit>  or erk  <cit> . functionally, pkcδ regulates different processes, such as cell cycle , apoptosis  <cit> , cell migration  <cit>  or transcription  <cit> . also, although pkcδ deficiency does not prevent mouse viability  <cit> , this isoform appears important in different contexts in health, as in the immune system  <cit>  or insulin sensitivity  <cit> , and disease, as for example in arteriosclerosis  <cit> . however, data regarding the general pkcδ expression pattern during mouse embryogenesis are still missing. this study shows the spatiotemporal expression of pkcδ during midgestation by immunostaining wild type mouse embryo sections and by using pkcδ deficient embryos expressing the lacz reporter gene under the control of the endogenous pkcδ promoter. these results could be helpful when addressing functional redundancy or exclusiveness of this npkc during murine development.

RESULTS
pkcδ expression from e <dig>  to e <dig> 
pkcδ analysis was mainly performed through lacz staining. antibody staining with the corresponding negative controls was also performed at e <dig>  and e <dig>  together with the lacz staining method as a control for the specifity of the lacz signal. to confirm the absence of endogenous β-galactosidase activity in our stainings, wild type littermates underwent the same protocol in parallel .

at e <dig> , whole mount lacz staining showed signal mainly at the primitive heart and yolk sac .

whole mount lacz staining of pkcδ deficient embryos at e <dig>  showed signal in rostral extremity of the notochord, trigeminal  neural crest tissue, dorsal aorta, pericardium, and developing heart. a closer look to the heart allowed for visualization of walls of the primitive ventricle, atrium and truncus arteriosus . immunostaining of wild type embryo sections at e <dig>  confirmed expression of pkcδ in somites and the same areas of the heart and pericardium . the specificity of the signal given by the antibody was confirmed by using pkcδ deficient embryo sections corresponding to the same developmental stage .

pkcδ expression from e <dig>  to e <dig> 
at e <dig> , novel β-galactosidase activity was observed at the roof of the hind brain, third branchial pouch, fourth branchial pouch and mandibular component of the first branchial arch . the signal observed at e <dig>  in trigeminal  neural crest tissue became more prominent at e <dig>  . e <dig>  was the earliest developmental stage at which ganglia started to show lac z reporter signal. thus, dorsal root ganglia, facio-acoustic  ganglion complex and trigeminal  ganglia all displayed β-galactosidase activity . in  <dig>  dpc embryos, dorsal root ganglia showed increased lacz staining, and the trigeminal  ganglion became also prominently stained . in addition, novel signal was detected at this stage in the vestibulocochlear ganglion  and neural tube . the broad and strong lacz reporter activity detected in ganglia suggests that pkcδ may have a significant role within the nervous system in mice. however, there is no obvious defect within the nervous system during murine development and adulthood. we believe this is due to functional redundancy among members of the pkc family. for example, overlapping expression of pkc δ  <cit>  and ε  <cit>  within the nervous system can be already found as part of a recent study that uses an in situ hybridization approach to show the expression pattern of a high number of transcripts in the mouse embryo  <cit> . thus, a redundancy where these two isoforms compensate each other could be a reason why no obvious phenotype is observed in the nervous system of pkc δ or ε single deficient mice during mouse embryogenesis.

at  <dig>  dpc, embryos also showed novel reporter activity at the precartilage primordia of bone at forelimbs and hindlimbs, such as femur and radius .

pkcδ expression at embryonic stages e <dig>  and e <dig> 
at e <dig>  , dorsal root ganglia showed approximately the same strong lacz signal observed in trigeminal  ganglia . new domains with β-galactosidase activity at this stage of development were the caudal part of the medulla oblongata, inferior ganglion of glossofaringeal  nerve, skin, and choroid plexus . however, lacz signal in the latter two domains was not detectable in pkcδ+/− embryos . at this stage, lacz-stained embryos were also embedded in paraffin blocks to generate sections that could let us better identify domains where β-galactosidase activity occurred. given the low signal observed in the  <dig> μm-thick sections,  <dig> μm sections were used instead in order to obtain a more prominent lacz staining signal. unfortunately, sections of such thickness affected somewhat the quality of the corresponding photographs. however, we were still able to identify domains that could also be observed in whole mount embryos, such as dorsal root ganglia, trigeminal  ganglion, vestibulocochlear ganglion, neural tube or cartilage primordium at limbs , as well as new areas that we could not see in whole embryos, such as loop of midgut within physiological umbilical hernia, dorsal part of tongue and lower border of nasal septum . at this stage, there seemed to be problems with penetration of x-gal in the embryo and therefore proper detection of signal in several domains, such as trigeminal ganglion . furthermore, sites such as stomach, which appeared stained at e <dig>  , was not detectable at e <dig> , possibly due to the same problem. we also performed immunostaining of pkcδ in wild type and pkcδ deficient  mouse embryo sections at e <dig> , which confirmed its expression at sites already identified in lacz stained embryos: dorsal root ganglia, inferior ganglion of glossofaringeal  nerve, vestibulocochlear ganglion, trigeminal  ganglion, loop of midgut within physiological umbilical hernia dorsal part of tongue, lower border of nasal septum, and cartilage primordium at limbs . in addition, antibodies to pkcδ applied on cross sections also revealed expression in the stomach and metanephros . sagittal sections reported the atrium of the heart, which could not be seen in lacz stained embryos or sections, possibly due to penetration issues of x-gal , as earlier mentioned. there were some areas detected through lac z staining that could not be detected via immunostaining. in these areas, the neo cassette that was used to generate pkcδ deficient mice might have influenced the expression of pkcδ  <cit> , although pkcδ might instead be too lowly expressed to see immunosignal with the protocol we used.

consistent with previous mrna studies at e <dig>   <cit> , our lacz staining of embryos at this stage showed signal in brain, neural tube and ganglia . however, we also found β-galactosidase activity at sites that we already described at earlier stages in this study, but whose patterns have not been reported before in such work at the mrna, such as skin  or cartilage primordia of bones . the staining in bone was more prominent and more defined than when identified at e <dig> . here, it could be readily observed in precartilage primordia of digit, precartilage primordial of phalangeal bone, and metatarsal bone . in addition,  <dig>  dpc embryos displayed lacz rerporter activity at whiskers and precartilage primordium of nasal septum .

CONCLUSIONS
our expression pattern for pkcδ during mouse midgestation suggests that several domains, such as cartilage primordium or skin, express this novel pkc isoform. however, the nervous system is the main site of expression for pkcδ. more specifically, dorsal root ganglia and trigeminal  ganglia are the domains where pkcδ seems to be most prominently expressed. thus, these data suggest that pkcδ may have an important role within the nervous system in mice, as already suggested by studies in other species  <cit> . the fact that there is no reported phenotype or functional deficiency in the nervous system suggest the existence of functional redundancy among members of the pkc family. thus, the expression pattern of pkcδ may contribute to address such redundancy in function as well as to identify domains causing potential lethality in mice lacking several pkc isoforms.
