BACKGROUND
histone modification plays a key role in the regulation of gene expression
 <cit> . acetylation by histone acetyltransferases  is normally correlated with increased gene activity, whereas deacetylation via histone deacetylases  is often associated with gene repression
 <cit> . in eukaryotes, histone acetylation is catalyzed by five distinct hat families, which comprise the p300/creb -binding protein  family, the tata-binding protein-associated factor ii <dig> family, the general control non-repressible 5-related n-terminal acetyltransferase  family, the moz, ybf2/sas <dig>  sas <dig>  and tip <dig>  family, and the nuclear hormone-related hats family
 <cit> . bioinformatics analysis suggests that currently there are  <dig> putative hats in arabidopsis thaliana, and these proteins belong to the cbp family , the tafii250-related family , the gnat family  and the myst family 
 <cit> .

in arabidopsis, accumulating evidence indicates that hats contribute to many aspects of plant growth and development, including root development
 <cit> , floral development
 <cit> , gametophyte development
 <cit> , and cell proliferation during organ growth
 <cit> . in addition, histone acetylation by hats is important for plant adaptation to environmental changes, such as light signaling
 <cit> , salt stress
 <cit> , cold stress
 <cit> , heat stress
 <cit> , abscisic acid  signaling
 <cit> , and other hormone signaling
 <cit> .

rice is an economically important crop and a model plant for genomics and molecular biology research in monocotyledons. eight hats have been identified in rice  and these proteins can be grouped into four major families, namely the cbp , tafii <dig> , gnat , and myst  families. the gnat family can be further divided into three subfamilies, namely gcn <dig>  elp <dig> and hat1
 <cit> . oshag <dig>  oshag <dig>  and oshag <dig> belong to the gcn <dig>  elp <dig>  and hat <dig> subfamilies, respectively
 <cit> . some phylogenetic analyses of hats have been performed previously
 <cit> . however, the evolutionary relationships of the cbp and tafii <dig> families remain unclear. in addition, the biological functions of oshats in rice have not been addressed.

to investigate potential functions of oshats, systematic bioinformatics and expression analyses were performed. phylogenetic trees for the cbp and tafii <dig> families were generated to explore the evolutionary relationships among representative species of monocotyledons , dicotyledons , bryophytes, pteridophytes, animals and fungi. multiple sequence alignment and domain analysis were used to predict the specific functions of oshats in comparison with the hats of other organisms. we also generated three-dimensional  comparative protein structure models of hats with the swiss-model
 <cit> . in addition, the subcellular localization of the eight oshats was predicted by protein sequence analyses. transient expression of oshac <dig>  oshag <dig>  and oshag <dig> in arabidopsis protoplasts was performed to determine the subcellular localization. finally, the expression patterns of oshats were analyzed using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction  analysis . the results obtained will make an important contribution to the elucidation of the functions of different hats in rice.

methods
searches of hat cdna and protein sequences
we searched for existing oshats sequence data in the ncbi , chromdb , uniprot , and kome  databases. hat cdna sequences and protein sequences were downloaded from chromdb . the sequences represented the monocots oryza sativa , oryza sativa , zea mays , sorghum bicolor , and triticum aestivum ; the dicots arabidopsis thaliana , populus trichocarpa , and glycine max ; the bryophyte physcomitrella patens  and pteridophyte selaginella moellendorffii ; the animals caenorhabditis elegans , drosophila melanogaster , and homo sapiens ; and the fungi saccharomyces cerevisiae  and schizosaccharomyces pombe . the chromdb nomenclature for all hat proteins is followed. the theoretical isoelectric point  and molecular weight  of the rice hat proteins were calculated with the compute pi/mw online tool  .

phylogenetic analyses
protein sequences were aligned with clustalx  <dig> 
 <cit> . unrooted radial trees were generated with the neighbor-joining method in conjunction with a bootstrap analysis of  <dig> replicates using the phylogeny inference package  version  <dig> 
 <cit> . the dayhoff pam model of protein evolutionary changes
 <cit>  was used to measure the branch lengths  of the tree with the protdist program. treeview version  <dig> . <dig> was used to display and edit the phylogenetic trees
 <cit> .

sequence analyses and alignments
multiple sequence alignments of representative hat proteins were generated with the clustalw <dig> online tool . protein domains and function sites of all hat proteins from rice and other organisms were assigned to the regions of target sequences with interproscan
 <cit>  using the swiss-model workspace website
 <cit>  . uniprotkb/trembl  was used to explore further the conserved domains and compositional biases in amino acid sequences
 <cit> . dog  <dig>  was used for drawing protein domain structures
 <cit> . uniprot blast  was used to determine the identities of oshat proteins and hat proteins from other organisms
 <cit> . 3d comparative protein structure models of hats were generated with the automatic modeling mode of swiss-model
 <cit>  implemented on the swiss-model workspace website . the protein structures were color-coded.

subcellular localization prediction
slp-local  is a subcellular location predictor based on local features of amino acid sequences
 <cit> . targetp version  <dig>   predicts the subcellular localization of eukaryotic proteins from the outputs of chlorop and signalp
 <cit> . the protein subcellular localization predictor wolf psort 
 <cit>  is based on psortii and ipsort. nuclear localization signals  were discriminated by traditional psortii prediction
 <cit>  from the detailed results of wolf psort. the netnes  <dig>  server  was used to predict leucine-rich nuclear export signals  in oshats by a combination of neural networks and hidden markov models
 <cit> .

plant materials and growth conditions
arabidopsis thaliana cultivar columbia- <dig>  was used for protoplast isolation and transient expression analyses. plants were grown in soil in a controlled-environment chamber with a long photoperiod  at 22 ± 2°c.

rice  seeds were imbibed with water in the dark at 37 ± 1°c for 24 h and then placed on filter paper  moistened with water in petri dishes at 23 ± 1°c in the dark. after germination, rice seedlings were grown in beakers containing water, in a culture room with a daily photoperiodic cycle of 9 h light and 15 h dark. the culture room temperature was 23 ± 1°c.

for aba , salicylic acid , and high salinity treatment, seedlings at the two-leaf stage growing in beakers were transferred to water with or without aba , sa  or nacl . for cold treatment, rice seedlings were incubated at 4 ± 1°c in the dark for 3 h. for heat treatment, seedlings were incubated in a 42°c incubator in the dark for 3 h. seedlings maintained in water at 23 ± 1°c in the dark were used as controls. leaves of rice seedlings at the two-leaf stage were harvested after treatment, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°c.

protoplast isolation and transient expression
the full-length cdnas of oshac <dig> were subcloned into the p2ygw <dig>  vector
 <cit>  to create the yfp-oshac <dig> construct, whereas the full-length cdnas of oshag <dig> and oshag <dig> were subcloned into the psat6-eyfp-n <dig> vector
 <cit>  to generate the oshag702-yfp and oshag704-yfp constructs. the isolation and transfection of arabidopsis leaf mesophyll protoplasts were conducted as previously described
 <cit> . briefly, protoplasts were isolated from well-expanded leaves of 3-week-old arabidopsis plants. volumes  of the oshac701/hag702/704-yfp fusion plasmid and vird2nls-mcherry as a nuclear marker
 <cit>  were cotransfected into 150 μl protoplasts  using a peg–calcium transfection solution. protoplasts were incubated at 22 ± 2°c under white light overnight to allow expression of the introduced genes. the yfp fluorescence was examined and photographed using a leica sp <dig> confocal microscope .

real-time quantitative pcr analysis
total rna was extracted from leaves of rice seedlings at the two-leaf stage using a modified lithium chloride precipitation method
 <cit> . the quantity and quality of rna were measured using a thermo scientific nanodroptm  <dig> spectrophotometer . rna was treated with dnase i  for 15 min prior to cdna synthesis. cdna was synthesized from 2 μg rna with the thermoscripttm rt-pcr system . rt-qpcr analysis was performed with the ssofasttm evagreen® supermix . data were collected with the cfx96tm real-time pcr detection system  in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. rt-qpcr data were expressed as the cycle number necessary to reach a threshold fluorescence value  and analyzed with the comparative ct method . the reported values were the means of three biological replicates, and each biological replicate consisted of three technical replications. eef-1α  and ubq- <dig>  were used as reference genes to normalize the expression data. pr10a , which can be induced by sa or aba
 <cit> , was selected as a control to determine whether the sa and aba treatments were effective in this study. the primers for rt-qpcr are listed in table 
 <dig>  the specificity of primer pairs was confirmed by melt curve analysis in comparison with triplicate no-template controls. pcr amplification efficiency was calculated from a standard curve of ct versus the logarithm of starting template quantity. each assay was optimized so that the amplification efficiency ranged between 90% and 110%, and with a coefficient of determination  greater than  <dig>  .

amplification efficiency and coefficient of determination  for each primer pair were determined from a standard curve by rt-qpcr.

all rt-qpcr data were expressed as the mean ± standard error. statistical differences of expression of each oshat among rice tissues were assessed by one-way analysis of variance  followed by the least significant difference  and student-neumann-keuls  post hoc comparison. the analyses were performed with spss  <dig>  software . the threshold of significance was defined as p <  <dig> . student’s t-test was used to assess the significance of differences between the exogenous treatment and the control. significance was established at p <  <dig>  or p <  <dig> .

western blot analysis
extraction of acid-soluble proteins was performed based on the descriptions by tariq et al.
 <cit>  and probst et al.
 <cit> . fresh rice leaves  were ground in liquid nitrogen and homogenized in  <dig>  ml freshly prepared extraction buffer using a fisher scientific model  <dig> sonic dismembrator. after centrifugation , the supernatant was stored at −80°c. protein concentration was determined by the micro-bradford assay with the bio-rad protein assay solution. protein extracts were added to  <dig>  mm dithiothreitol, separated on a 16% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel, and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane using a bio-rad semi-dry electrophoretic transfer cell . the following antibodies were used: anti-histone h <dig> , anti-acetyl-histone h3k <dig> , anti-acetyl-histone h3k <dig> , and anti-acetyl-histone h4k <dig> . histone h <dig> was applied as an equal loading control. the bound immune-complexes were detected with ecl plus western blot detection reagents  and exposed to classic single-emulsion autoradiography film . the films were developed automatically with an agfa cp <dig> x-ray film processor and scanned with an umax powerlook  <dig> scanner.

RESULTS
cbp family of hats
three cbp family proteins were identified in rice, namely oshac <dig>  oshac <dig>  and oshac <dig>  phylogenetic analysis of the cbp family proteins from different plant and animal species  showed that the monocot cbp proteins could be divided into two distinct groups . group i contained oshac <dig>  whereas group ii contained oshac <dig> and oshac <dig>  likewise, the dicot cbp proteins were grouped into two distinct groups . further analysis  indicated that oshac <dig> was only  <dig> % and  <dig> % identical with oshac <dig> and oshac <dig>  respectively. by contrast, oshac <dig> and oshac <dig> shared  <dig> % sequence identity. in addition, oshac <dig> on average showed  <dig> % sequence identity to the monocot cbp proteins of group i , whereas on average it showed only about  <dig> % sequence identity to monocot cbp proteins of group ii . these observations further reinforced the results of the phylogenetic analysis that rice cbp proteins could be divided into two groups. furthermore, oshac <dig>  oshac <dig>  and oshac <dig> were about  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % identical with group a dicot proteins, and about  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % identical with group b dicot proteins, which indicated that the group ii proteins were more similar to the groups a and b proteins than to the group i proteins. rice cbp proteins showed low sequence identities with bryophyte proteins  and pteridophyte proteins , and even lower identities with animal proteins . taken together, these sequence analysis results  were consistent with the clusters obtained in the phylogenetic tree .

five domains , comprising the duf902_creb-binding protein domain , fyve/phd-type zinc finger , duf906_transcriptional coactivation domain , zz-type zinc finger , and taz-type zinc finger , were identified in oshac <dig> and other group i monocot cbp proteins  with interproscan
 <cit> . by contrast, two additional domains were identified in oshac <dig> and oshac <dig> as well as other group ii cbp proteins; one was a zz-type zinc finger located near the c-terminal region between the zz-type zinc finger and the taz-type zinc finger, and the other was a taz-type domain displayed on the left side of the duf902_creb-binding protein domain. similar to the group ii monocot proteins, the group b dicot proteins all contained seven domains, but with one additional fyve/phd-type zinc finger that overlapped with the duf902_creb-binding protein domain. the duf <dig> domain is found in several transcriptional coactivators related to transcriptional activation and histone acetylation
 <cit> . the duf <dig> domain involved in transcriptional coactivation is part of the cbp-type hat domain
 <cit> . taz-type, zz-type and fyve/phd-type zinc fingers have important roles in protein recognition and protein–protein interactions
 <cit> . evidence also suggests that phd fingers interact with histones and other histone-recognition proteins
 <cit> . these analyses indicated that oshac <dig>  oshac <dig>  and oshac <dig> may have hat activity and transcription cofactor activities. the duf <dig> and duf <dig> domains are highly conserved within the cbp family proteins of plants. members of plant cbp family proteins differ in the type and number of zinc fingers. different types of zinc fingers may bind to different proteins or histones
 <cit>  and be recruited to different target areas of chromatin.
 <cit> . abbreviations for organisms are: oryza sativa subsp . japonica , zea mays , sorghum bicolor , arabidopsis thaliana , populus trichocarpa .

in terms of amino acid compositional bias, oshac <dig> contains a ser-rich region  and a cys-rich region . oshac <dig> contains two gln-rich regions , whereas oshac <dig> contains a poly-ser stretch  as well as a gln-rich region . a cys-rich region in oshac <dig> implies that this protein may interact with other proteins
 <cit> . gln-rich regions in oshac <dig> and oshac <dig> may mediate transcriptional activation
 <cit> . similar to oshac <dig>  athac <dig>  athac <dig> and athac <dig> all contain two gln-rich regions, whereas athac <dig> contains one gln-rich region similar to oshac <dig> and athac <dig> contains a ser-rich region similar to oshac <dig> 

athac <dig> shows acetyltransferase activity
 <cit>  and transcriptional coactivator function for a heat-shock-inducible gene in a protoplast system
 <cit> . furthermore, athac <dig>  athac <dig> and athac <dig> have broad-specificity hat activities and likely act together to acetylate histone h <dig> lysine  <dig> 
 <cit> . in vivo, athac <dig>  athac <dig> and athac <dig> play redundant roles in the promotion of flowering by repressing the expression of the floral repressor flc 
 <cit> . similarly, athac <dig> was reported to regulate flowering time by epigenetic modification of factors upstream of flc  <cit> . furthermore, athac <dig> interacts with a tomato heat stress transcription factor hsfb <dig> in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . it remains to be determined whether rice and arabidopsis homologs of cbp family proteins have similar biological functions.

tafii <dig> family of hats
oshaf <dig> is the only tafii <dig> family hat in the rice genome. other species  have one or two tafii250-type proteins. phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> tafii <dig> family proteins showed that these proteins could be grouped into five clusters . given the high bootstrap support for the tree topology, we deduced that all of the tafii <dig> family proteins might share a common origin and belong to the same class. oshaf <dig> was placed in the monocot cluster in the unrooted neighbor-joining tree. at the amino acid level, uniprot blast analysis revealed that oshaf <dig>  had about  <dig> % sequence identity with osihaf <dig>   <dig> % with other monocot homologs ,  <dig> % with dicot homologs ,  <dig> % with bryophyte and pteridophyte homologs ,  <dig> % with animal homologs , and  <dig> % with fungus homologs .

domain analysis of tafii <dig> family proteins in rice with interproscan indicated that four major domains were present in oshaf701: a tafii <dig> tbp-binding domain , an ubiquitin domain , a c2hc zinc finger domain  and a bromodomain . similar results are reported for arabidopsis <cit>  and maize. comparison of 3d models with swiss-model workspace
 <cit>  revealed high similarities of 3d structures  existed among oshaf <dig>  athaf <dig>  athaf <dig> and zmhaf <dig> .

in terms of amino acid compositional bias, oshaf <dig> carried an asp-rich region  in its n-terminal region, a poly-ala stretch  and a poly-lys stretch . athaf <dig> contained an asp-rich region  near the n-terminus and a poly-lys stretch  near the c-terminus similar to oshaf <dig>  athaf <dig> contained two poly-lys stretches .

tafii <dig> family genes encode tata-binding protein -associated factor 1
 <cit> . the asp-rich region responsible for substrate binding
 <cit>  overlapped with the tafii <dig> tbp-binding domain in oshaf <dig> and athaf <dig>  the asp-rich region may therefore participate in the regulation of enzyme activities
 <cit> . a bromodomain known to bind to acetylated histone lysine residues
 <cit>  was identified in the c-terminal ends of both tafii <dig> and gcn <dig> family proteins
 <cit> . sequence alignment showed conservation in the sequences of bromodomains within oshaf <dig> and oshag <dig> . in arabidopsis, both athaf2/attaf <dig> and athag1/atgcn <dig> are required for h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  and h4k <dig> acetylation of light-regulated genes involved in the light regulation of growth and development
 <cit> . in addition, athaf <dig> regulates the expression of several cold-regulated genes independent of its hat activity
 <cit> . for athaf <dig>  rnai-mediated gene silencing of athaf <dig> in arabidopsis confers resistance to agrobacterium-mediated transformation
 <cit> . the similarities in the conserved domains and 3d models of oshaf <dig>  athaf <dig> and athaf <dig> indicate that oshaf <dig> may have similar functions to those of athaf <dig> and athaf <dig> 

gnat family of hats
gcn <dig> subfamily of the gnat family
a gcn <dig> homolog identified in rice is oshag <dig>  two domains are present in oshag <dig>  namely a gcn5-related n-acetyltransferase  domain  and bromodomain . the 3d models of the gnat domain and bromodomain analyzed with swiss-model workspace
 <cit>  showed that high similarities existed among oshag <dig>  athag <dig> and zmhag <dig> . as detected with uniprotkb, oshag <dig> carried three amino acid compositional biases in its n-terminal region : a ser-rich region , a poly-asp stretch , and an ala-rich region . similar amino acid compositional biases were identified in other monocot gcn <dig> subfamily proteins such as zmhag <dig>  athag <dig> also contained a ser-rich  region in its n-terminal region.

the ser-rich region is implicated in the regulation of enzyme activities
 <cit> . the ala-rich region is essential for transcriptional repression and interaction with tbp 
 <cit> . consistent with the analyses of 3d models, alignment of the gcn <dig> subfamily proteins indicated that the gnat domain and bromodomain were highly conserved in the gcn <dig> subfamily proteins of spermatophytes
 <cit> . these results suggest that oshag <dig> might have similar functions to those of athag <dig> and zmhag <dig>  athag1/atgcn <dig> shows hat activity
 <cit> , acetylate primarily h3k14
 <cit> , and contribute to cold-regulated gene expression
 <cit> . athag <dig> is also involved in controlling floral meristem activity through regulation of the expression of wuschel and agamous <cit> . furthermore, athag <dig> is required for light-inducible gene expression
 <cit> , and is essential for root stem-cell niche maintenance
 <cit>  and the regulation of mirna accumulation at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels
 <cit> . taken together, these data suggest that athag <dig> is involved in both long-term epigenetic regulation of chromatin modification and short-term control of transcriptional switches. given that oshag <dig> displays a high sequence similarity with athag <dig>  oshag <dig> may also play an important role in different aspects of plant development and stress response.

hat <dig> subfamily of the gnat family
multiple sequence alignments show that the protein sequence of oshag <dig> has high sequence similarity with other hat <dig> subfamily proteins in monocots and dicots . domain analysis with interproscan and 3d protein structure analysis indicated that rice and five other angiosperm hat1-type proteins all contained a homologous structure called acetyl-coenzyme a: amino acid n-acetyltransferases   of about  <dig> amino acid residues in length. a gnat domain , which was identified in athag <dig> and gmhag <dig> by domain analysis with interproscan, was not identified in other hat <dig> subfamily proteins. a portion of the gmhag <dig> sequence  forms a 3d ribbon diagram that is very similar to the gnat domain of athag <dig> . on the basis of the multiple sequence alignment, the gnat domain sequence in gmhag <dig> showed strong sequence similarity with that of the gmhag <dig> sequence , which suggested that a gnat domain is present in gmhag <dig>  furthermore, owing to the highly conserved sequences within the hat <dig> subfamily proteins of six angiosperms , we predict that oshag <dig> may also contain a gnat domain.

the high similarities of protein sequences and 3d models among the monocot and dicot homologs of the hat <dig> subfamily also suggested that they may have similar functional roles. athag <dig>  acetylates histone h4k12
 <cit>  and the expression of zmhag102/ hat-b is repressed by aba treatment during maize seed germination
 <cit> .

elp <dig> subfamily of the gnat family
a high sequence similarity was observed among the elp <dig> subfamily proteins in plants
 <cit> , fungi and animals. analyses of 3d models of elp <dig>  and gnat  domains in oshag <dig>  zmhag <dig>  zmhag <dig>  and athag <dig> with swiss-model
 <cit>  indicated high similarity of 3d structures existed among these proteins . sequence alignment  and 3d structure analysis  indicated that the gnat domain in the elp <dig> subfamily  was different from those in the gcn <dig> subfamily  and hat <dig> subfamily .

oshag <dig> and its homologs of the elp <dig> subfamily may also have similar functions, because they shared high similarities in sequences and 3d structures. athag3/atelp <dig> is a member of the conserved elongator hat complex that interacts with rna pol ii during transcript elongation and plays a role in cell proliferation during organ growth
 <cit> . furthermore, athag <dig> can regulate plant response to aba, oxidative stress resistance, and anthocyanin biosynthesis
 <cit> . arabidopsis elongator also regulates the auxin signaling gene shy2/iaa <dig>  the auxin influx carrier lax <dig>  ethylene signaling, jasmonic acid signaling, and abiotic stress
 <cit> . in addition, rnai lines of athag <dig> are resistant to agrobacterium-mediated transformation
 <cit> .

myst family of hats
the myst family is divided into five unrelated classes. class i comprises proteins from the green lineage comprising the myst family proteins of arabidopsis and rice
 <cit> . osham <dig> was the only myst family protein identified in rice. as shown in figure 
4e, the 3d structure of the chromodomain in osham <dig> was similar to those in atham <dig>  atham <dig>  zmham <dig>  and zmham <dig>  moreover, the 3d structure of the nat structure in osham <dig> was strikingly similar to those in atham <dig>  atham <dig>  zmham <dig>  and zmham <dig>  in addition, osham <dig> contains an ala-rich region and a poly-gly stretch at its n-terminus .

amino acid sequences of myst-type proteins are highly conserved within monocots and dicots
 <cit> . the nat structure is the main conserved region for acetyltransferase activity. the chromodomain in the myst family of hats, similar to the bromodomain in hats, is reported to be able to identify and bind specific histone residues
 <cit> . the high similarities of amino acid sequences and 3d models of myst-type hats suggested that osham <dig> might have a similar function to those of other myst-type proteins in arabidopsis and other angiosperms. atham <dig> and atham <dig> preferentially acetylate h4k5
 <cit>  and are involved in gamete formation in both male and female organs in arabidopsis  <cit> .

subcellular localization prediction
five subcellular localization prediction programs were used to determine the possible localization sites of hats from rice , arabidopsis and maize . the subcellular localization of proteins with slp-local
 <cit>  generated localization sites for seven oshats with a low reliability index  except for oshaf <dig>  which might be localized in the nucleus or cytosol with higher reliability. similar slp-local results were obtained for athats and zmhats. only athaf <dig>  athaf <dig>  and zmhaf <dig> generated a higher ri for the predicted subcellular localization . likewise, targetp
 <cit>  detected possible localization sites for most hats with low reliability; however, oshaf <dig>  athaf <dig>  zmhac <dig>  and zmhaf <dig> were predicted to be localized in the nucleus or cytosol with the strongest confidence  1). wolf psort
 <cit>  also showed low frequency values for hats; however, oshac <dig> scored relatively high frequencies  for both nuclear and cytosolic localizations. in addition, athac <dig> and zmhac <dig> received relatively high ri scores for both nuclear and cytosolic localizations. these results suggested that oshac <dig>  athac <dig>  and zmhac <dig> might be dually localized proteins that undergo nucleocytosolic transport
 <cit> . from the detailed results with wolf psort, a traditional psortii predictor
 <cit>  identified nls  in all oshats, athats, and zmhats. among oshats, oshaf <dig> had the highest positive nls score, suggesting the highest probability for nuclear localization, whereas osham <dig> had a negative nls score, which provided a strong indication for its cytosolic localization. nlss were observed for all oshat proteins.

a: subcellular locations predicted by slp-local and targetp are chloroplast, mitochondria, secretory pathway, and other locations  for eukaryotic proteins.

b ri: reliability index ranges from  <dig> to  <dig>  as the value of ri increases, the reliability of the slp-local prediction increases. chlo: chloroplast, the sequence contains a chloroplast transit peptide. nucl or cyto: any other location .

c rc: reliability class from  <dig> to  <dig>  the lower the rc value is, the safer the prediction.

d the numbers in parentheses indicate the prior probability that such protein localized to a given site is equal to the proportion of proteins in the data set
 <cit> . abbreviations and the number of proteins of the localization site in the data set: nucl: nucleus ; chlo: chloroplast ; cyto: cytosol ; e.r.: endoplasmic reticulum ; cysk_nucl: cytoskeleton and nucleus ; plas: plasma membrane ; mito: mitochondria ; cyto_nucl: cytosol and nucleus ; pero: peroxisomes . last updated date: 2007/08/ <dig> 

e numbers reflect amino acid residues that showed nuclear localization signals . three types of nls  were detected in oshats. a positive nls score indicates a higher probability of nuclear localization, and a negative nls score indicates a higher probability for cytosolic localization.

f the amino acid position and residue exhibiting predicted nuclear export signal .

zmhag101/zmgcn <dig>  contains a nls in its n-terminus. further studies confirmed that the n-terminus is responsible for nuclear targeting of zmhag101
 <cit> . earley et al.
 <cit>  reported that athag <dig> , athag <dig> , and atham <dig> and atham <dig>  tended to be enriched at the periphery of the nucleolus, whereas atham <dig> and atham <dig> overlapped with the chromocenters containing the nucleolus organizer region, which suggested that these hats might be important for the activation of ribosomal rna genes. on the other hand, zmhag102/zmhat-b  is predominantly localized in the cytosol, and a significant proportion of zmhag <dig> is present in the nucleus
 <cit> . netnes
 <cit>  detected leucine-rich nes in all oshats as well as zmhag <dig>  the presence of nes in all oshats suggests that they might be exported out of the nucleus.

nuclear and cytosolic localization of oshac <dig>  oshag <dig> and oshag704
transient expression analyses of oshac701/oshag702/oshag704-yfp fusion constructs in arabidopsis protoplasts were used to determine the subcellular localization of oshac <dig>  oshag <dig>  and oshag <dig>  as shown in figure 
 <dig>  oshac701-yfp, oshag702-yfp, and oshag704-yfp were localized in both the nucleus and cytosol. these experimental data were consistent with the subcellular localization predictions that oshac <dig>  oshag <dig>  and oshag <dig> all contain nls and leucine-rich nes. nuclear and cytosolic localization was also observed in the homolog of oshag <dig> in maize, zmhag102/zmhat-b
 <cit> . hats in humans catalyze acetylation of specific lysine residues not only in histone but also in non-histone substrates
 <cit> . in arabidopsis, it is suggested that lysine acetylation may occur on diverse proteins outside the nucleus
 <cit> . the cytosolic localization of oshac <dig>  oshag <dig>  and oshag <dig> implies that these oshats might play an important catalytic role other than histone acetylation.

expression of oshats analyzed by rt-qpcr
expression of oshats in different tissues
rt-qpcr analysis was performed to examine the expression of oshats in five types of tissue, comprising seeds after 23-h imbibition, 4-day-old seedlings, and roots, sheathes, and leaves of two-leaf-stage seedlings . eight oshats were expressed in all tissues examined but with significant differences in the transcript abundance. the highest transcript levels of all oshats except oshag <dig> were observed in the leaves of two-leaf-stage seedlings, whereas os hats transcript levels were very low in seeds after 23-h imbibition and 4-day-old seedlings. constant expression in all of the tissues indicated that hats play an important role in rice, but these proteins potentially have distinct functions with respect to development and defense against adverse conditions.

expression of oshats in response to aba treatment
the plant hormone aba plays a pivotal role in a variety of developmental processes such as regulation of seed germination and seedling establishment
 <cit> . aba is also involved in plant responses to various stresses, such as salt, osmotic, cold, wound and pathogenic stresses
 <cit> . to determine if the expression of os hats during rice seedling growth was regulated by aba, we analyzed the expression pattern of oshats after treatment with 100 μm aba for 24 h . pr10a was used as a positive control. pr10a transcription increased by  <dig> -fold after aba treatment for 24 h, which indicated that the treatment was effective. transcript levels of oshac <dig>  oshac <dig>  oshag <dig>  oshag <dig>  and osham <dig> were significantly elevated in response to exogenous aba application. these results indicated that oshac <dig>  oshac <dig>  oshag <dig>  oshag <dig>  and osham <dig> may be involved in the aba signaling pathway for response to environmental stresses during rice seedling growth.

treatment with aba for a short period of time  causes dynamic changes in histone h <dig> and h <dig> acetylation and phosphorylation in tobacco by- <dig> cells, arabidopsis t <dig> cells and whole leaves of tobacco and arabidopsis  <cit> . previous studies reveal that treatment of the leaves of rice seedlings with 100 μm aba for 24 h increases the expression of oshda <dig>  but represses the expression of ossrt <dig> and ossrt <dig>  <cit> . aba treatment of barley seedlings also induces the expression of hvgcn5hvelp <dig>  and hvmsyt  <cit> . in contrast, aba treatment of maize seeds for  <dig> or 72 h represses the expression of zmhag <dig>  and zmhag <dig> , as well as several zmhdacs. aba selectively induces histone acetylation of the vp <dig> gene  and activates its transcription, which suggests that zmhats and zmhdacs might participate in the aba signal pathway during seed germination
 <cit> . in arabidopsis seedlings, aba downregulates the expression of athd2c, an hd2-type hdac, whereas overexpression of athd2c enhances the aba tolerance of arabidopsis, which suggests that athd2c may modulate aba and stress responses
 <cit> . furthermore, the involvement of athag <dig>  in aba responses in arabidopsis is reported
 <cit> . more recently, chen et al.
 <cit>  reported that aba treatment enriched the gene activation markers, histone h3k9k <dig> acetylation, and h3k <dig> trimethylation, but decreased the gene repression marker, h3k <dig> dimethylation, of a number of aba-inducible genes in arabidopsis. taken together, these observations indicate that histone acetylation/deacetylation induced by hats and hdacs is involved in the regulation of the aba signaling pathway in a variety of plants including arabidopsis, tobacco, maize, and rice.

expression of oshats in response to sa treatment
sa plays an important regulatory role in multiple physiological processes such as the plant immune response. furthermore, sa can interact with other phytohormones such as aba, auxin, and gibberellic acid
 <cit> . rt-qpcr analysis was performed using total rna from leaves of two-leaf-stage seedlings exposed to 100 μm sa to examine whether oshats were regulated by sa . the transcript level of pr10a increased by  <dig> -fold in response to sa treatment for 24 h compared with that of the control plants. after sa treatment for 36 h, the expression levels of oshac <dig> and oshac <dig> were reduced to  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, of those of control plants. no obvious changes were observed in the expression of the other six oshat genes after treatment with sa for 24 h or 36 h . previous studies show that treatment of the leaves of rice seedlings with 100 μm sa for 12 h downregulates the expression of oshda <dig>  oshda <dig>  oshda <dig>  ossrt <dig>  and ossrt <dig> but upregulates the expression of oshdt <dig>  <cit> . these observations indicate that members of the hat and hdac gene families may be involved in the sa signaling pathway in plant defense responses.

expression of oshats in response to salt, cold and heat treatment
with salt treatment, the transcript levels of oshac <dig>  oshac <dig>  oshac <dig>  oshag <dig>  and osham <dig> were increased by  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively, in comparison with the controls .

the expression of eight oshats was also measured in seedlings exposed to low temperature. except for oshag <dig>  the expression of the other oshats was decreased to  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, after 3 h of cold exposure, in comparison with the controls .

in response to heat treatment , pr10a transcripts increased by  <dig> -fold in leaves of two-leaf-stage seedlings after exposure to 42°c for 3 h. compared with the controls, the transcript levels of oshac <dig>  oshag <dig>  and osham <dig> were increased by  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, in response to heat treatment. conversely, the expression of oshac <dig> and oshag <dig> were decreased by  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively.

previous research shows that salt stress induces the expression of oshda <dig>  whereas the expression of oshda <dig>  oshda <dig>  and ossrt <dig> is decreased. cold treatment represses the expression of oshda <dig>  oshda <dig>  and ossrt <dig> but induces the expression of oshda <dig> <cit> . athag <dig> contributes to the expression of cold-regulated genes during cold acclimation
 <cit> . athaf <dig> participates in the regulation of some cold-regulated genes
 <cit> . athac <dig> interacts with a tomato heat stress transcription factor hsfb <dig> that contains a histone-like motif
 <cit> . in addition, an analysis of microarray data with genevestigator indicated that heat stress  upregulates the expression of athda <dig>  athda <dig>  athda <dig>  athda <dig>  and athda <dig> <cit> . taken together, hats and hdacs can be modulated by salt, cold or heat stress, which suggests that these proteins may play an important role as epigenetic regulators for plant response to abiotic stress conditions.

with regard to the leaves of two-leaf-stage rice seedlings treated with salt for 12 h, western blot analysis showed that histone h3k <dig> acetylation was increased , but no changes in the acetylation of h3k <dig> and h4k <dig>  were observed. previous studies show that in cultured cells and leaves of arabidopsis and tobacco, histone h <dig> ser- <dig> phosphorylation, h <dig> phosphoacetylation and histone h <dig> acetylation are upregulated by salt treatment
 <cit> . we observed increased transcript levels of oshac <dig>  oshac <dig>  oshac <dig>  oshag <dig>  and osham <dig> in response to salt stress, which was correlated with the increase in histone h3k <dig> acetylation. therefore, these proteins may have a role in salt stress response in rice.

CONCLUSIONS
the present phylogenetic analyses of the cbp and tafii <dig> hat family provide insights into the evolutionary relationships of these two protein families. both monocot and dicot cbp family proteins can be subdivided into two distinct groups. diversity in the specific domains identified in different oshats indicates that oshats have undergone functional diversification. the high similarities of protein sequences, conserved domains and 3d models among oshats and their homologs in arabidopsis and maize suggests that oshats perform multiple functions during rice growth and development. subcellular localization predictions indicate that all oshats might localize in both the nucleus and cytosol. transient expression analyses of arabidopsis protoplasts confirmed the nuclear and cytosolic localization of oshac <dig>  oshag <dig>  and oshag <dig>  rt-qpcr analyses show that oshats are expressed constitutively in rice. in addition, their expression is modulated by exogenous treatment with the hormones aba and sa as well as salt, cold and heat stresses, which suggests that oshats may play important roles in plant defense responses.
