BACKGROUND
lipids are important components of cells, with a function in cellular structure, regulation, signaling and as energy source, in particular neutral lipids. the cellular location of storage of neutral lipid is the lipid droplet . lds consist of a core of neutral lipids that is surrounded by a monolayer of phospholipids, mainly phosphatidylcholine  <cit> . different proteins are associated with the lds, including several enzymes of lipid metabolism  <cit> .

many metabolic disorders like diabetes and cardiovascular diseases are associated with defects in lipid metabolism and derive from additive defects in different pathways, often described as metabolic syndrome that can gradually progress into more severe diseases. the first step is usually the excess storage of lipids within different body tissues resulting in the development of obesity  <cit> . therefore, it is crucial to understand how the storage of lipids is regulated under normal conditions.

lipids are in a constant flux and are continuously converted into each other. within cells they can move within membranes and between different cellular compartments. furthermore, lipids are exchanged between different tissues. extracellularly, the bulk of lipids is transported in lipoproteins. these lipoproteins are soluble complexes of proteins  and lipids that are transported in the circulation of vertebrates and insects and that are synthesized in the liver and intestine. they are classified into chylomicrons , very low density , low density  and high density  lipoproteins based on their apolipoprotein component and their density, which is determined by the lipid composition  <cit> . the major neutral lipid, triacylglycerol , is secreted from the liver and intestine in apolipoproteinb  containing lipoproteins . in contrast to other apolipoproteins, apob is not exchangeable between lipoproteins and resides in the plasma in a lipid-associated form only. while vldl and cm contain apoe, apoc and apob, ldl harbors exclusively apob. in the absence of loaded lipids apob cannot be secreted and is rapidly degraded  <cit> . the tag secreted as cm and vldl mainly derives from tag stored in cytosolic lds  <cit> .

depending on cell type, nutritional status and developmental state the ld pool can vary in droplet number, size and localization within short time scales  <cit> . the growth of lds and the incorporation of fas into tag is a fast event, typically taking just a few minutes  <cit> . once formed, lipid droplets can fuse with each other  <cit>  or transfer material by a slow coalescence event  <cit> . chronic stimulation of lipolysis in adipocytes results in a fragmentation of large lds into small lds, which are dispersed throughout the cell  <cit> . these rapid changes of the ld core require a similarly rapid increase or decrease of the ld surface or an adaptation of the surface to volume ratio.

the major phospholipid of the ld surface, phosphatidylcholine, can be synthesized by three different pathways: the de-novo pathway, which is also known as kennedy pathway, the lands cycle and the phosphatidylethanolamine methyl transferase  pathway, which is restricted to liver cells  <cit> . in the kennedy pathway, phosphocholine is activated with cytidine triphosphate  and transferred to diacylglyceride  to form pc. these reactions are catalyzed by the cytoplasmic ctp:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase  and the membrane-embedded cholinephosphotransferase or choline/ethanolamine phosphotransferase   <cit> . in the lands cycle phospholipase a <dig>  removes fatty acids at the sn- <dig> position of pc, which results in the formation of lysophosphatidylcholine . this can be used in a reverse reaction, the addition of a fatty acid at the sn- <dig> position, to yield pc. this re-acylation is catalyzed by lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferases   <cit> . recently, four lpcats were cloned and characterized  <cit> . they are all reported to localize to the er compartment. due to their structure they divide into two subgroups with lpcat <dig> and lpcat <dig> in one and lpcat <dig> and lpcat <dig> in the other group. lpcat <dig> is reported to function in lung surfactant production, while lpcat <dig> seems to be important in inflammatory reactions.

we have recently shown that diacylglycerol acyltransferase  <dig>  can localize to the surface of lds and is active in synthesizing locally tag stored in the core of lds  <cit> . furthermore, we have also shown that two enzymes of the lands cycle, lpcat <dig> and lpcat <dig>  can localize to the surface of lds and that they can synthesize pc directly at the ld  <cit> .

here, we show that these proteins are important for the morphology of the cellular ld pool in different mammalian cell types and drosophila melanogaster. we demonstrate that interference with both cellular pc synthesis pathways results in an increase in ld size, but due to different mechanisms. we identified the lpcat1/ <dig> ortholog in drosophila melanogaster and demonstrate its lpcat activity. additionally, we show that interference with lpcat <dig> influences lipoprotein particle secretion from hepatoma cells.

RESULTS
knockdown of lpcat <dig> and lpcat <dig> increases ld size
since both lpcat <dig> and lpcat <dig> are present and active at the surface of lds, we investigated their importance for the cellular ld pool. if local production of pc by lpcat <dig> and lpcat <dig> is functionally important for the ld monolayer, manipulation of lpcat activity may result in a phenotypic alteration of cellular ld pools. therefore, we performed sirna-mediated gene silencing of the lpcats followed by microscopic imaging of lds, quantification of ld size and number and further characterization of the phenotype. a double knockdown  of lpcat <dig> and lpcat <dig> by means of two different specific sirnas targeting lpcat <dig> and lpcat <dig> lead to a reduction of both proteins in a <dig> cells . this reduction resulted in a significant increase in the mean size of lds, expressed as the cross-sectional area  and a slightly reduced number of lds . since double kds are difficult and phenotypes are weak due to mutual compensation by the isoenzymes, we also analyzed the human hepatoma cell line huh <dig>  which expresses lpcat <dig>  <cit>  and lpcat <dig>  but no lpcat <dig>  <cit> . knockdown of lpcat <dig> in huh <dig> cells with two different sirna sequences resulted in a decreased lpcat activity in whole cell lysates  and in a decrease in lpcat <dig> protein down to about 10% of control . phenotypically, this kd resulted in the appearance of larger lds . a quantification of the microscopic images revealed a significant increase in the mean ld size upon lpcat <dig> kd . this increase is due to a shift in the ld size distribution from small lds  to larger lds  . this increase in size is paralleled by a significant decrease in number of lds . the results show that a reduction of lpcat <dig> and lpcat <dig> leads to a shift of the cellular ld sizes to larger lds accompanied by simultaneous decrease in number of lds in different cell types.figure  <dig>

knock-down of lpcat <dig> in huh <dig> cells reduces lipoprotein particle secretion
huh <dig> cells synthesize and secrete apob containing vldl particles  <cit>  with a similar density as ldl particles , whose assembly requires the long-chain acyl-coa synthetase acsl <dig>  <cit> . this protein activates fatty acids for subsequent incorporation into pc and localizes to lds  <cit> , suggesting that it functions together with lpcat <dig> in pc synthesis at lds. earlier studies suggested that secretion of vldl would depend on mobilization of tag from lds  <cit> , which might be slower when small lds are replaced by larger lds with a smaller surface to volume ratio. given these close connections between hepatic tag and pc metabolism, we hypothesized that lpcat <dig> activity might also influence lipoprotein assembly and secretion. to address this issue, we monitored the secretion of lipoprotein particles from huh <dig> cells by measuring the amount of secreted apolipoprotein b . knockdown of lpcat <dig> with two distinct sirnas resulted in a significant reduction of apob secretion and a decrease in secretion of radiolabeled lipids .

ld size increase occurs without changes in the neutral lipid pool
an increase of ld size can result from an overall increased storage of neutral lipids, particularly tag, or from a morphological rearrangement of the ld pool at constant tag amounts. neither a <dig>  nor huh <dig>  cells showed a difference in incorporation of alkyne-labeled oleate into tag relative to incorporation into pc between control sirna-treated cells and cells treated with lpcat1- and lpcat2-specific sirna. additionally, also the amount of other major lipid species remained unchanged independent of the sirna treatment in both cell lines, a <dig>  and huh <dig> . the results suggest that the mechanism for the increase in ld size results from an adjustment of the surface to volume ratio rather than the formation of more neutral lipids.figure  <dig> 
increase in ld size upon lpcat1/ <dig> knock-down is independent of neutral lipid synthesis and accumulation. a) a <dig> cells were transfected with sirna as described in figure 1a. seventy hours after sirna transfection growth medium was exchanged to medium containing 10% delipidated fcs and  <dig> μm alkyne-oleate. after two hours cells were washed and lipids extracted. extracts were subjected to quantitative click-analysis for the ratio of incorporation of alkyne fatty acid into tag and pc. data are mean ± stddev, n =  <dig>  significances were calculated by unpaired two-sided t-test analysis relative to non-targeting sirna  and were found to be insignificant. b) a <dig> cells were transfected as described in figure 1a. after  <dig> h, total lipid extracts were analyzed by mass spectrometry in duplicate samples, and species abundances were normalized to the corresponding internal standard. the molar contents of each species of the same class were summed up and normalized to the total content of all detectable lipids. c) huh <dig> cells were transfected with sirna as described in figure 2a. seventy hours after sirna transfection as indicated, growth medium was exchanged to medium containing 10% delipidated fcs and  <dig> μm alkyne-oleate. after two hours, cells were washed, lipids extracted and extracts were subjected to quantitative click-analysis as in panel a. data are mean ± stddev, n =  <dig>  significances were calculated compared to non-targeting sirnas  and were found to be insignificant. d) huh <dig> cells were transfected as described in figure 2a. after  <dig> h, total lipid extracts were analyzed by mass spectrometry in duplicate samples. species abundances were normalized as described for panel b.



ld size increase by inhibition of the de-novo pc synthesis pathway is connected to changes in neutral lipid content
it was reported that interference with the de-novo pc pathway also results in increased ld size in s <dig> cells  <cit> . furthermore, the inhibition of this pathway leads to a switch in lipid metabolism from the formation of pc towards the formation of tag  <cit> . in a <dig> cells, we observed an increase in the size of lds  upon knockdown of ctalpha mrna  along with a decrease of the ratio of pc to tag biosynthesis . steady state lipid pool size, analyzed by mass spectrometry, showed a non-significant tendency towards increased tag and ce and a significant reduction of ether-linked pc  upon ctalpha knock-down.figure  <dig> 
inhibition of de-novo pc synthesis results in increased ld size and tag synthesis. a <dig> cells were left untreated , treated with transfection reagent  or transfected with a non-targeting stealth sirnas  or three different stealth sirnas against ct alpha  for  <dig> h. a) representative confocal images, stained with dapi  and ld <dig> . bar,  <dig> μm. b) images were analyzed for ld size as described in methods. data are mean ld size ± stddev, calculated from >  <dig> individual cells in  <dig> independent experiments. significances were calculated by unpaired two-sided t-test analysis relative to non-targeting control  . c) amount of ct alpha mrna left after ctalpha knock-down relative to non targeting control, measured by real-time pcr. standard deviations and significances were calculated by unpaired t-test analysis from  <dig> different experiments . d) seventy hours after sirna transfection as indicated, growth medium was exchanged to medium containing 10% delipidated fcs and  <dig> μm alkyne-oleate. after two hours cells were washed and lipids extracted and analyzed for alkyne labeled tag and pc. data are mean ± stddev, n =  <dig>  significances were calculated by unpaired two-sided t-test analysis relative to non-targeting control  . e) a <dig> cells were transfected as described for panel a. after  <dig> h, total lipid extracts were analyzed by mass spectrometry in triplicate samples. species abundances were normalized to the corresponding internal standard. species of each class were summed up and normalized to total detectable lipids. significances for tag, ce and pc o- were calculated by unpaired two-sided t-test analysis relative to non-targeting control  and relative to mock transfection .



lpcat <dig> and lpcat <dig> do not influence the cellular ld pool
besides the homologous lpcat <dig> and lpcat <dig> two other proteins with lpcat activity were identified and named lpcat <dig> and lpcat <dig>  <cit> . these proteins belong to a different family of proteins and are multispan transmembrane proteins structurally related to acat  proteins. especially, the ubiquitous lpcat <dig> was reported to be the main lpcat in liver cells  <cit> . though these proteins were not identified on lds, but were reported to localize to the er compartment, we investigated whether a single or double knock-down of these proteins has an effect on the ld pool. in a <dig> cells, no effect on the mean ld size  was observed upon knock-down of lpcat <dig> mrna, lpcat <dig> mrna or combinations thereof  consistent with the fact that neither lpcat <dig> nor lpcat <dig> localize to lds, lpcat activities of ld preparations were unaffected by the knock-downs , while total cell lysates showed significantly reduced lpcat activities . this indicates that only lpcats with the ability to localize to lds influence the ld size.figure  <dig> 
ld size is unaffected by knock-down of lpcat <dig> and lpcat <dig>  a) a <dig> cells were either left untreated, mock transfected  or transfected with a non-targeting stealth sirnas  or with the two different stealth sirna sequences against lpcat <dig>  or lpcat <dig>  or combinations thereof as indicated. after  <dig> h incubation cells were fixed, stained with dapi and ld <dig> and imaged. ld size was quantified with imagej. standard deviations and significances were calculated from  <dig> experiments by unpaired t-test analysis compared to non-targeting control and were found to be insignificant. b) mrna was measured by real-time pcr after single or double knock-down of lpcat <dig> and lpcat <dig> as described for panel a. values are shown relative to the non-targeting control. standard deviations and significances were calculated as above . c) a <dig> cells were either transfected with non-targeting stealth sirna or with stealth sirna sequence against lpcat <dig>  or lpcat <dig>  or combination .  <dig> h after transfection  <dig> μm oleate was added to the medium to induce formation of lds.  <dig> h after transfection cells were lysed and lipid droplets were purified using sucrose gradient and subjected to a lpcat activity assay. values are normalized to the amount of the ld protein nsdhl as determined by western blotting. standard deviations and significances were calculated as above and were found to be insignificant. d) a <dig> cells were treated with stealth sirna and supplemented with oleate as described for panel c.  <dig> h after transfection cells were lysed and lysate was subjected to a lpcat activity assay using equal amounts of total protein. standard deviations and significances were calculated from three experiments as above  compared to non-targeting control.



the drosophila melanogaster lpcat1/ <dig> ortholog cg <dig> has lpcat activity, localizes to lds and regulates ld size
the ability to form lds is conserved from yeast to mammals, and orthologs of many mammalian ld proteins and enzymes involved in lipid metabolism are reported in model organisms like drosophila melanogaster  <cit> . in drosophila, cutting-edge genetic technologies can be combined with immunohistochemistry, cell biology and biochemistry approaches. furthermore, manipulations of the metabolism can be achieved by feeding specific diets that contain particular metabolites  or chemical inhibitors  <cit>  and the analysis of metabolite/lipid fluxes between tissues can be studied. many functions of the mammalian liver and adipose tissue are executed in the insects fat body, an organ that is particularly pronounced in the late larval state  <cit> .

in order to test whether the influence of the ld localizing lpcat <dig> and lpcat <dig> on the cellular ld pool is conserved in evolution, we investigated their function on the organismic level. lpcat <dig> and lpcat <dig> have one predicted ortholog in drosophila melanogaster, which is annotated as cg <dig> and is predicted to be a lpc acyltransferase. gfp-conjugated cg <dig> in oleate-supplemented s <dig> cells showed colocalization with lds . three different cg32699-specific rnai drosophila strains showed reduced levels of cg <dig> mrna . by dic microscopy on isolated fat bodies of l <dig> larvae, we observed enlarged lds in the fat body of rnai strains . quantification of dic images from rnai strains show a reduction in the number of lds  while the size of lds is increased , similar as was seen for mammalian cells in culture. lpcat activity assays on l <dig> larvae showed that lpcat activity was decreased in the rnai strains, indicating that this protein indeed has lpcat activity . these results show that the influence of lpcat1/ <dig> on the cellular ld pool is a general property of these proteins beyond cell types and species.figure  <dig>

discussion
to rationalize the different effects of the above knockdowns, it is necessary to recapitulate the different isoenzymes and pathways that produce the main components of lds, i.e. tag and pc. in most eukaryotes, tag is produced by dgat <dig> and dgat <dig>  while dgat <dig> is a multispan protein localizing to the er  <cit> , dgat <dig> has a hairpin structure and localizes to both the er and lds  <cit> . a similar, but more complex situation exists for the synthesis of pc. the formation of cdp-choline by ct alpha, the rate limiting step of the pc de-novo kennedy pathway, localizes to lds and er  <cit> , but the actual synthesis of pc by cept <dig> and cpt <dig> is confined to the er and golgi  <cit>  and not found on lds  <cit> . the alternative lpcat pathway, which forms pc from lpc and acyl-coa , has at least four isoenzymes, two of which, i.e. lpcat3/ <dig>  are exclusively on the er  <cit> , while lpcat1/ <dig> again localize to er and lds  <cit> . direct regulatory interactions between the pathways exist, e.g. lpcat <dig> promotes the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of cpt <dig>  <cit> . analogous to dgat <dig>  lpcat3/ <dig> are multispan proteins  <cit>  while lpcat1/ <dig> have a hairpin structure like dgat <dig>  <cit> . some tissues, particularly liver, and organisms such as bakers yeast have in addition the pemt pathway to convert pe to pc by methylation  <cit> , which will not be discussed in more detail here.

essentially, our data now show that reduction of lpcat1/ <dig> results in unchanged balance between pc and tag synthesis, along with a remodeling of ld morphology towards larger lds, while reduction of the de novo pathway enzyme ct alpha changes the balance between pc and tag synthesis towards the latter, accompanied by larger lds and higher tag content. reduction of er-localized lpcat3/ <dig> apparently does not influence neutral lipid storage. also, knockdown of lpcat <dig> decreases lipoprotein secretion by hepatoma cells.

these observations are consistent with the following scenario: de-novo pc synthesis by the kennedy pathway occurs mostly at the er and depends on the availability of choline and its activation to cdp-choline by ct alpha. if other precursors and metabolic energy are available but choline is lacking, low pc synthesis capacity is balanced by increased synthesis and storage of neutral lipid  <cit> . the small extra amount of ld surface pc that is necessary to store the increased amounts of tag  <cit>  is likely recruited from other cellular membranes. since cell growth and division requires synthesis of pc  <cit> , the stored tag can provide the precursors for pc synthesis once cdp-choline becomes available. in this situation, the rapid synthesis of pc is supported by the activation of ct alpha upon recruitment to lds . the de-novo synthetic pc will be processed by the lands cycle enzymes lpcat1- <dig>  amongst those, lpcat1/ <dig> influence the ld size but not the amount of synthesized pc or tag. the increase of ld size upon decrease of lpcat1/ <dig> activity suggests that these enzymes are either involved in the recruitment of pc to the growing lds by vectorial acylation of the soluble precursor lpc or that their effect on pc species composition reduces the tendency of lds to coalesce. the fact that reduction of lpcat3/ <dig> does not result in the same phenotype underlines the importance of compartmentalization. the different physical properties of bilayer and monolayer membranes lead to separation of these isoenzymes with polytopic and monotopic mode of membranes insertion. this allows compartmentalization of synthesis and maintenance of separate pools with different fate, but makes cells susceptible towards defects in one of the enzymes.

the complex organization of lipid metabolism is also illustrated by the role of lpcat activity in lipoprotein secretion. knockdown of lpcat <dig> reduced lipoprotein secretion but had a very small effect on cellular lipid composition . previous findings suggested that lipidation of vldl requires breakdown of stored tag and transfer of released fatty acids from lds to vldl  <cit>  possibly via er-luminal lds  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that lpcat <dig> influences lipid secretion by direct supply of pc for the formation of lipoprotein particles in the er, although it appears unlikely that reduced lpcat <dig> leads to a shortage of pc at the er, where the pc de-novo synthesis pathway operates. reduced vldl secretion in huh <dig> cells was also observed upon knock-down of acsl <dig>  and could be rescued by supplementation with pc  <cit> . since both acsl <dig>  <cit>  and lpcat <dig> localize to lds, this supports the idea that acsl <dig> supplies acyl-coas to lpcat <dig> to generate pc on the ld surface, where about 50% of cellular lpcat <dig> are found in huh <dig> cells. the influence on lipid secretion may then arise from a changed lipid mobilization from lds, where an increase in ld surface seems to be connected to increased lipolysis  <cit> . it is possible that the activity of lpcat <dig> is needed to provide surface area for the ld attachment of lipid degrading and transferring proteins. by this way interference with lpcat <dig> would slow down lipid secretion without interfering with the actual secretion process.

the phenotype of lpcat1/ <dig> depletion is identical in both, cultured cells and in the fat body of the multicellular organism drosophila melanogaster. since it is reported that many mammalian proteins and signalling pathways in lipid metabolism are conserved in drosophila melanogaster   <cit>  the similar phenotype in the mammalian cell lines and drosophila fat body suggest a conserved mechanisms of ld surface control. as this single ortholog behaves similar to the mammalian proteins, it will be easier accessible for functional studies. in particular with the drosophila model there is a multicellular model available, in which the importance of the protein in development or in lipid fluxes between tissues can be studied by creating a real knock-out fly.

CONCLUSIONS
lds are dynamic organelles that grow or shrink within minutes during periods of high fa availability or upon stimulation of lipolysis. we showed that for the growth of lds the necessary enzymatic activities, namely dgat <dig> for tag production and lpcat <dig> and lpcat <dig> for surface pc production, are directly located to the surface of the ld. in line with the idea of local adjustment of lds to growth and shrinkage, we showed that reduction of surface pc producing enzymes lpcat <dig> and lpcat <dig> influences lipid packaging. the restriction of ld pc synthesizing enzymes leads to increased ld size paralleled by reduced ld number, unchanged cellular neutral lipid content and reduced cellular lipid release. our observations also emphasize the importance of isoenzymes, their different cellular localization and parallel synthesis pathways. we showed that only lpcat <dig> and lpcat <dig>  which localize to the er and lds, are able to influence the ld pool while the isoenzymes lpcat <dig> and lpcat <dig>  which localize to the er, had no effect on the ld pool. furthermore, we showed that interference with de-novo pc synthesis pathway also influences the ld pool leading to a similar phenotype as interference with the land cycle, but due to a different mechanism. while interference with de-novo pc synthesis stimulates tag synthesis and ld loading, interference of the lands cycle pc synthesis influences lipid packing by reduction of available or appropriate surface. our study identified an lpcat1/ <dig> ortholog in drosophila melanogaster with similar function in regulating the cellular ld pool, emphasizing the generality and conservation of the underlying regulatory network. our work stresses the need to understand the differences and importance of parallel synthesis pathways, isoenzymes and localization of reactions in order to understand physiological and pathological lipid storage.
