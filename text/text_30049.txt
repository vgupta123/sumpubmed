BACKGROUND
the maintenance of genome stability is an essential requirement for cellular homeostasis. the detection and repair of dna damages is an important aspect of this process and is facilitated by proteins that comprise a number of distinct, while over-lapping, enzymatic repair pathways  <cit> .

homologous recombination  is a major dna repair pathway that may be employed for the repair of double-strand dna breaks  during s and g <dig> of the cell cycle  <cit> . here, 5′ dsb ends are resected to generate long stretches of single-stranded dna . these ssdna strands may subsequently invade a sister chromatid, guided by rad <dig>  where they are extended via complementarity  <cit> . second-end capture then allows the invading strand to re-anneal with the non-invading dsb end, leaving two interlaced sister chromatids  <cit> . enzymatic processing of the intervening junctions  subsequently yields two intact dsdna strands. hr can also be used for the repair of stalled and collapsed replication forks  <cit> . in these cases, the rad51-nucleated ssdna strand is generated either by resection of the ‘one-ended’ dsb formed by fork collapse  <cit> , or from the nascent leading strand of an otherwise intact, although stalled, replication fork  <cit> . the nucleated strand can then re-invade the same chromatid and replication can continue without need for second-end capture  <cit> .

the remodelling of duplex dna, as well as the migration of fork and holliday junctions, is a central requirement of hr and is achieved by a number of dna helicases. bloom syndrome protein , a member of the recq family of helicases, is one such enzyme, with roles in hr, as well as telomere maintenance and replication  <cit> . the enzymatic activity of blm is achieved through its evolutionarily conserved helicase domain, a feature it shares in humans with the related helicases wrn, recq <dig>  recq <dig> and recq5β  <cit> . during the initiation of hr, blm associates with the mre11–rad50–nbs <dig>  complex and with either the exo <dig> or ctip nucleases to promote end resection and the generation of an invading ssdna strand  <cit> . in addition, blm is required for the dissolution of double holliday junctions, during the later stages of hr  <cit> . here, blm is able to converge both holliday junctions into a hemi-catenane structure, which is subsequently cleaved by its binding partner topiiiα, generating two non-crossover products  <cit> . blm is also thought to be required for the restart of stalled replication forks, where it is proposed to stimulate fork regression and holliday junction formation  <cit> . this activity may result in the displacement of the nascent leading strand, generating a stretch of ssdna that could subsequently be used for strand invasion  <cit> .

single-stranded dna-binding  proteins are additional fundamental components of dna repair pathways  <cit> . these can be subdivided into the “simple ssbs”, which are composed of one polypeptide, as well as the higher-order “replication protein a ”-like ssbs  <cit> . rpa is the most studied ssb family member in humans and is a central factor in many dna repair processes . humans also encode a number of simple ssbs, including the more recently described human single-stranded dna-binding protein  <dig>   <cit> . hssb <dig> has previously been found to function in hr-mediated dsb repair, where it is involved in the initial detection of lesions, as well as the stimulation of end-resection by mrn and exo <dig> . hssb <dig> also has described roles in the response to replication disruption and promotes replication fork restart following polymerase inhibition  <cit> .

in this study we demonstrate that in addition to these roles, hssb <dig> can form a dynamic complex with blm. loss of hssb <dig> results in a decreased stability of blm polypeptide and consequently a failure in blm accumulation at sites of dna damage and stalled replication.

methods
cell culture and treatments
u2os and hela cell lines were obtained from sigma-aldrich, european collection of authenticated cell cultures and were maintained at 37 °c in roswell park memorial institute  medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. for ionising radiation treatment, cells were exposed to 6 gy of gamma radiation generated from a cesium-source irradiator  and were harvested at the indicated time points after treatment. camptothecin  was added to the culture media and cells were incubated for 4 h. hydroxyurea  was added to the culture media and cells were incubated as indicated after which cells were harvested for immunoblotting or fixed for immunofluorescence. for inhibition of the proteasome, cells were grown in rpmi supplemented with 10 μm mg <dig>  as indicated. cycloheximide   was added to the culture media to inhibit protein synthesis for the time indicated.

sirna and plasmid transfections
stealth small interfering rna   5′-gcccuuccagcaacccuguuaguaa- <dig> and esirna  were used as indicated to transiently deplete hssb <dig>  transfection of sirna was carried out using lipofectamine rnaimax  at a final concentration of 40 nm for stealth sirna and 20 nm for esirna. subsequent treatments were performed at 72 h post sirna transfection.

wt and f98a 3× flag hssb <dig> plasmids have been described previously  <cit> . ha-tagged sirna-resistant hssb <dig> was generated from a previously described sirna resistant 3× flag hssb <dig> construct  <cit>  by site directed mutagenesis, which was performed using a described methodology  <cit>  and the following primers:  5-tacccatacgatgttccagattacgctgcgatcgccatgacgacggagacc-3′,  5′agcgtaatctggaacatcgtatgggtacatggtggcagatctcctcggtaccgg-3′. for the rescue experiment, ha-tagged sirna-resistant hssb <dig> was transiently transfected into cells that had previously been depleted of endogenous hssb <dig>  plasmids were transfected using fugene hd  transfection reagent.

real time qpcr
for real time quantitative rt-pcr, rna was isolated using the rneasy kit  and 1 μg of rna was used for cdna synthesis using the rtpcr kit . qrtpcr was performed using the viia <dig> system . the primers used were as follows: blm fwd 5′-gcagcgatgtgatttgcatc-3′, blm rev 5′-attcagcttcttccaaattcttctt-3′, hssb <dig> fwd 5′-agccaaacccagagtacagc-3′, hssb <dig> rev 5′- ctggttctcagaggctggag-3′, 7sl fwd 5′-atcgggtgtccgcactaagtt-3′, 7sl rev 5′-cagcacgggagttttgacct-3′.

cell lysis, immunoblotting and antibodies
hela and u2os whole cell lysates were prepared by resuspension of cells in radioimmunoprecipitation  buffer, followed by sonication as described previously  <cit> . samples were then electrophoresed on 4–12% bis–tris plus bolt precast gels  and proteins transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes prior to incubation with primary antibodies.

the hssb <dig> antibody was purified from sheep anti-serum as described previously  <cit> . rabbit and goat antibodies against blm were purchased from bethyl  and used for immunoprecipitation and western blotting. a blm antibody was also purchased from sigma-aldrich  and used for immunofluorescence microscopy and western blotting. commercial antibodies against rpa <dig> , sp <dig> , ps <dig> atm  and pol ii ctd  were purchased from cell signaling technology. mre <dig> , h <dig>  and flag  antibodies were purchased from sigma-aldrich, the actin antibody  from bd biosciences, the ints <dig> antibody  from bethyl, the pcna antibody  from vwr and the rpa <dig> antibody from oncogene research products .

primary antibodies were detected with fluorescent  donkey anti-mouse, rabbit, goat or rat secondary antibodies  and visualised using an odyssey imaging system . western blot quantification was performed with imagej software.

co-immunoprecipitation
cells were resuspended in ice-cold immunoprecipitation buffer  and 1× pierce universal nuclease for cell lysis  and lysed by sonication. samples were then incubated with magnetic protein a/g dynabeads  that had firstly been incubated with 1 μg of primary antibody per mg of cell lysate. samples were incubated with beads for 1 h at room-temperature, beads washed five times in pbs containing  <dig> % tween  <dig> and bound proteins eluted in loading dye prior to analysis by immunoblotting.

immunofluorescence microscopy
cells were grown in optical glass bottom  <dig> well plates . following ir or hu treatment, cells were pre-extracted for 5 min in ice-cold extraction buffer , 20 mm nacl, 5 mm mgcl <dig>  1 mm atp and  <dig> % np40). cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in pbs, permeabilised in  <dig> % triton and blocked with 5% goat serum. images were taken on a deltavision pdv microscope and analysed using image j  software. pearson correlation coefficient was measured using the deltavision softworx software version  <dig> . <dig> . one-way analysis of variance was employed to assess whether a statistically significant difference between the mean pearson correlation coefficient value  may exist between control and treated cells using graphpad prism version  <dig> software. post hoc analysis was then employed to compare the mean r <dig> value of each treatment group with the mean r <dig> value of control cells.

sub-cellular protein fractionation
sub-cellular protein fractionation was performed using a pierce subcellular fractionation kit  as per manufacturer’s instructions.

RESULTS
hssb <dig> associates with blm in cells
human single stranded dna-binding protein  <dig> is a central cellular component required for the repair of double-strand breaks by hr, as well as the repair and restart of stalled and collapsed dna replication forks . recruitment kinetics of hssb <dig> provide evidence for both early and late functions in these repair processes  <cit> . hssb1 has been identified in several protein complexes including with mrn, hogg <dig>  ints <dig>  rad <dig> and p <dig> . the blm helicase, like hssb <dig>  is involved in the repair of ir-induced dsbs and the repair of stalled dna replication forks  <cit> . blm is also known to interact with proteins that contain ob-folds such as the trimeric rpa complex  <cit> , rmi <dig> and rmi <dig>  <cit> , thus we wondered whether blm might also interact with the ob-fold containing protein hssb <dig>  we first investigated the interaction between blm and hssb <dig> at various time points post ir treatment by immunoprecipitating blm from u2os whole cell lysates using an anti-blm antibody. to exclude the possibility that dna or rna might mediate the interaction, we treated the cell lysates with benzonase or universal nuclease before performing the co-immunoprecipitation experiments. we consistently found that hssb <dig> and blm were present in the same protein complex in cells and that the interaction decreased at  <dig> h post ir and returned to basal levels by 3 h post ir . the reciprocal immunoprecipitation with an anti-hssb <dig> antibody confirmed the interaction, as well as the dynamics of the interaction with a decrease in blm protein in the hssb <dig> complex at 1 h post ir and return to basal levels at 3 h post ir . we also immunoblotted for ints <dig>  a known hssb <dig> interactor  <cit> , which confirmed the presence of ints <dig> in the precipitant. moreover, we did not observe a similar decrease in the hssb1–ints <dig> interaction in response to ir treatment, indicating that the dissociation of blm from the hssb <dig> complex is specific to blm. these results suggest that a blm and hssb1-containing protein complex exists in untreated cells and that ir treatment induces an initial dissociation of blm and hssb <dig> and re-association at 2–3 h post treatment.fig.  <dig> hssb <dig> associates with blm in cells. blm  or hssb <dig> -associating proteins were immunoprecipitated from u2os whole cell lysates prepared from cells that had been either left untreated or exposed to 6 gy ionising radiation  and harvested after the indicated time periods. control immunoprecipitations with an isotype igg were performed from combination  samples comprised of equal amounts of each sample. eluted proteins and whole cell lysates were separated by electrophoresis and immunoblotted with antibodies against blm, hssb <dig> and ints <dig> . hssb <dig>  or blm  levels were determined by densitometry, normalised to the levels of blm  or hssb <dig>  as well as to the level of input protein and expressed relative to the untreated lane. c line graph illustrating hssb1: blm association from three independent repeats of a and b. d blm was immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysates, prepared from u2os cells that were either untreated or had been treated with 2 mm hydroxyurea  for 6 h. eluted proteins and whole cell lysate samples  were immunoblotted with antibodies against blm and hssb <dig>  hssb <dig> levels were determined and expressed as per . e u2os cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wild type  or f98a 3× flag hssb <dig>  24 h prior to cell lysis and immunoprecipitation of blm-association proteins. eluent was immunoblotted with antibodies against blm, flag, ints <dig>  mre <dig>  rpa <dig> and rpa <dig>  flag levels were determined by densitometry and normalised to the levels of blm




both hssb <dig> and blm have described roles in the restart of stalled dna replication forks  <cit> . to investigate if the interaction between hssb <dig> and blm was altered after fork stalling, we treated u2os cells with hydroxyurea  for 6 h and performed immunoprecipitation reactions in whole cell lysates. as shown in fig. 1d, we did not observe a significant change in the interaction between blm and hssb <dig>  suggesting the blm and hssb <dig> interaction is not affected by the hu treatment at the time point examined. interestingly, the blm antibody used in the immunoprecipitation detected  <dig> bands  although only one band is associated with the hssb <dig> complex . further studies are required to verify if these bands represent post-translationally modified blm protein and which species of blm is found in complex with hssb <dig> 

a large proportion of the cellular hssb <dig> pool is present in complex with ints <dig>  <cit> . in order to investigate whether the interaction between blm and hssb <dig> is mediated by ints <dig>  3× flag-tagged hssb <dig> wild type  and ints3-binding mutant f98a   plasmids were overexpressed in u2os cells and protein complexes were immunoprecipitated using an anti-blm antibody. as shown in fig. 1e, both wt and f98a mutant hssb <dig> were co-immunoprecipitated by the blm antibody to similar levels, however the ints <dig> protein did not immunoprecipitate to the same degree in the cells expressing the hssb1–f98a mutant, suggesting that ints <dig> is not required for the hssb1–blm interaction. it does however demonstrate for the first time that ints <dig> is in complex with blm and hssb <dig> within cells. the known blm binding partners mre <dig>  rpa <dig> and rpa <dig> were also detected in the blm complex .

we further investigated whether hssb <dig> and blm may interact directly using recombinant hssb <dig>  and blm  proteins. however, we were unable to detect a direct interaction between the two proteins . taken together, these results suggest that blm and hssb <dig> may associate in cells through an indirect means, or may require specific post-translational modifications not present in the recombinant proteins. indeed, both hssb <dig> and blm are known to exist in phosphorylated, ubiquitinated and sumoylated  forms  <cit> .

hssb1-positive chromatin structures partially overlap with blm-positive chromatin structures following ir- and hu- induced dna damage
human single stranded dna-binding protein <dig> and blm have been shown to re-locate to chromatin in cells treated with dna damaging agents and dna replication inhibitors  <cit> . to determine whether blm and hssb <dig> relocate to the same chromatin structures in response to dsb induction, we performed a time course following ir treatment in asynchronous hela cells. prior to fixation at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 6 h post ir treatment  cells were pre-extracted to remove the soluble nucleoplasm, leaving only the insoluble chromatin bound proteins to be immunostained and visualised. as expected, both blm and hssb <dig> showed a large increase in chromatin localisation following ir treatment, with a partial overlap between hssb1- and blm- positive fluorescence staining . measurement of the pearson correlation coefficient  determined that the overlap between blm- and hssb1-positive staining significantly increased at all time points tested, with a peak at 3 h post ir .fig.  <dig> hssb <dig> co-localises with blm at ir- and hu-induced nuclear foci. a, c hela cells were pre-extracted prior to fixation,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 6 h post ionising radiation  treatment  or  <dig>   <dig> and 20 h post treatment with hydroxyurea  as indicated . fixed cells were incubated with primary antibodies against blm, hssb <dig> and pcna , which were detected with fluorescent secondary antibodies and visualised using a deltavision pdv microscope. co-localisation of blm and hssb <dig> is demonstrated by the merged image  and by the analysis of images using the image j colocalisation plugin showing only the colocalised pixels . dapi was used to stain the nuclei. b, d
box and whisker plots representing pearson correlation coefficient  from  <dig>  and  <dig>  individual cells for each time-point from a and c. one-way anova followed by post hoc analysis was used to assess the statistical significance between the mean r <dig> values of each treatment group and untreated cells. ****p <  <dig> 




we also investigated the localisation of blm and hssb <dig> following replication stress. hela cells were treated with hu for 4 h to induce mostly stalled replication forks and for 20 h to induce stalled and collapsed replication forks  <cit> . prior to fixation, cells were extracted to remove the soluble nucleoplasm. to identify s-phase cells, pcna was used as a marker. as expected, we observed an increase in blm and hssb <dig> chromatin localisation post both  <dig> and 20 h of hu treatment , with a significant increase in overlap between hssb1- and blm-positive staining at both time points .

the partial overlap between hssb <dig> and blm at ir- and hu- induced chromatin structures may represent different sub-compartments within one repair centre or a snapshot of the temporally dynamic composition of these chromatin structures  <cit> , which is consistent with their roles in the unwinding of the dna  and coating of the single stranded dna  during the repair process. taken together, these results suggest that although blm and hssb <dig> are part of the same dna repair complex they may function at different sites or stages in the dsb repair process and in the restart and repair of stalled and collapsed replication forks.

hssb <dig> is required for recruitment of blm to chromatin in response to dna damage
we and others have shown that in response to dsb formation, hssb <dig> is required for both activation of signalling and proper recruitment of repair proteins at these sites  <cit> . we therefore investigated whether hssb <dig> depletion may affect blm recruitment to chromatin in response to dna damaging agents and replication stress using subcellular fractionation to separate the nuclear components. u2os cells transfected with control or hssb1-targeting esirna  were irradiated to cause dsbs and harvested 4 h post treatment. as expected, blm was found to load onto chromatin following ir treatment in control sirna transfected cells . in contrast, in hssb1-depleted cells, blm chromatin loading was consistently reduced at 4 h and 3 h post ir treatment . moreover, we also observed consistently reduced levels of blm chromatin loading in the nuclease-resistant chromatin fraction  and reduced protein levels in the soluble nuclear fraction , suggesting that hssb <dig> may regulate blm protein levels in the soluble nuclear fraction, consequently also affecting its recruitment to chromatin.fig.  <dig> hssb <dig> is required for recruitment of blm to chromatin in response to dna damage. a, b, c u2os cells were transfected with control or hssb <dig> mrna-targeting sirna. 72 h later, cells were then either left untreated or exposed to 6 gy ionising radiation , 4 h prior to harvesting and subcellular fractionation. proteins from the indicated fractions were separated by electrophoresis and immunoblotted with antibodies against blm, hssb <dig>  h <dig>  and actin . blm levels were determined by densitometry, normalized to the levels of h <dig> or actin and expressed relative to the untreated lane. d, e, f u2os cells were depleted of hssb <dig> as per above and treated with  <dig> μm camptothecin  for 3 h or 2 mm hydroxyurea  for  <dig>  72 h post sirna transfection. cells were then harvested, subcellular fractionation performed and the indicated fractions immunoblotted with antibodies against blm, hssb <dig>  pol ii ctd, rpa <dig>  ps <dig> rpa <dig>  rpa <dig>  sp <dig> and h <dig> as indicated. blm levels were determined as per above. g hela cells were transfected with hssb <dig> transcript-targetting sirna and harvested after  <dig> or 96 h. whole cell lysates were prepared and immunoblotted with antibodies against blm, hssb <dig> and actin




we have recently shown that hssb <dig> is also required for recruitment of dna repair proteins to collapsed replication forks  <cit> . consistent with its roles in hr and dna replication, blm expression is highest during s/g <dig> cell cycle phases  <cit> , we hence investigated whether hssb <dig> depletion may also affect blm protein levels and recruitment to chromatin in response to replication stress, in the different nuclear compartments. hela cells transfected with control or hssb <dig> targeting stealth sirna  were treated with hu  for 20 h to induce replication fork collapse or with camptothecin  for 3 h to cause replication-induced dsbs. as expected, blm was found to load onto chromatin  following hu and cpt treatment in control sirna transfected cells . in contrast, in hssb1-depleted cells, blm chromatin loading was slightly, but reproducibly reduced following hu and cpt treatment . following hu treatment, rpa is phosphorylated on ser  <dig> and this facilitates the response of replication forks to replication stress  <cit> . we also observed that loading of rpa <dig>  rpa <dig> and phosphorylation of rpa <dig> at serine  <dig>  were reduced in hssb <dig> depleted cells . in the nuclease resistant chromatin fraction, two blm bands were detected and although both bands showed decreased chromatin loading in hssb <dig> depleted cells, a more pronounced defect was observed for the top band . moreover, soluble nuclear levels of blm were decreased in hssb1-depleted cells to half the amount of control cells, and a lack of blm protein stabilisation in response to hu treatment was also evident in hssb1-depleted cells . similarly, rpa  <dig> and rpa  <dig> protein levels were also decreased following hssb <dig> depletion . the defect in blm chromatin recruitment following hu treatment in absence of hssb <dig> was detected in both hela and u2os cells . consistent with this blm defect in the nuclear fractions, total blm protein levels were reduce by ~50% in hssb <dig> depleted hela cells compared to control cells . collectively, these results suggest that hssb <dig> may regulate the total cellular pool of blm, affecting its recruitment to chromatin in response to ir-induced dsbs, replication fork collapse and replication-induced dsbs.

hssb <dig> protects blm from proteasomal degradation
to further confirm our data, we performed rescue experiments using a sirna-resistant, ha-tagged hssb <dig> construct . 48 h post hssb1-targeting sirna transfection, u2os cells were transfected with the ha-hssb <dig> plasmid and harvested 48 h later. importantly, ectopic expression of hssb <dig> was able to rescue blm protein levels to near-basal levels , indicating that blm depletion was not due to sirna off-target effects. based on these findings we reasoned that hssb <dig> could regulate blm helicase by at least two mechanisms: by regulating blm transcript, , or by regulating blm protein stability.fig.  <dig> hssb <dig> protects blm from proteasomal degradation. a u2os cells were transfected with control or hssb1-depleting sirna, 48 h prior to transfection with an sirna-resistant ha-tagged hssb <dig> plasmid . cells were harvested after a further 48 h and whole cell lysates immunoblotted with antibodies against blm, hssb <dig> and actin. blm levels were determined by densitometry, normalised to the levels of actin and expressed relative to the untreated lane. b u2os cells were transfected with control or hssb1-depleting sirna for 72 h. blm and hssb <dig> mrna levels were determined by real time pcr and normalised to the mrna levels of 7sl. the graph represents the results from three independent experiments. a t test was used to assess statistical significance where p <  <dig>  was considered significant. n.s. non-significant. c u2os cells were transfected with control or hssb1-depleting sirna, 72 h prior to incubation with  <dig> μm mg- <dig> for 6 h. cells were then lysed and whole cell lysates immunoblotted with antibodies against blm, hssb <dig> and actin. blm levels were determined by densitometry, normalised to the levels of actin and expressed relative to the untreated lane




to address whether hssb <dig> may affect blm transcript levels, we performed real time quantitative pcr in u2os cells depleted of hssb <dig> using stealth and esirna. as shown in fig. 4b, the average of three independent experiments, a slight, although not significant upregulation of blm transcripts levels were observed in hssb1-depleted cells compared to control cells, suggesting that the lack of blm protein was not due to reduced levels of blm transcript. the loss of the blm polypeptide in hssb1-depleted cells may therefore reflect a loss of protein stability. to investigate whether hssb <dig> regulates blm protein stability by preventing its proteasome-mediated degradation, we next treated u2os cells depleted of hssb <dig> with the proteasome inhibitor mg <dig>  indeed, mg <dig> treatment restored blm protein levels in hssb1-depleted u2os cells , suggesting that hssb <dig> interaction with the blm complex may protect blm from degradation in cells.

discussion
blm is an essential helicase with demonstrated roles in hr-mediated dna repair processes  <cit> . in this study, we have identified a novel association between blm and hssb <dig>  a single-stranded dna-binding protein also known to promote hr during double-strand dna break repair and stalled replication fork stability and repair  <cit> . reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments suggested that while blm and hssb <dig> associate in undamaged cells, the induction of double-strand dna breaks by ionising radiation exposure results in an initial dissociation of the hssb1–blm complex, prior to re-association 2–3 h post treatment. these data may suggest that while hssb <dig> and blm form a complex in undamaged cells, they may function independently in the early stages of hr-mediated dsb repair. this may include during end-resection, a process that is facilitated by the blm–dna2–rpa–mrn and exo1–blm–rpa–mrn complexes  <cit> . indeed, whilst we and others have suggested a role for hssb <dig> in the initial stimulation of this process  <cit> , our data may suggest that hssb <dig> might not remain coupled to the blm-associated end-resection machinery subsequent to initial loading. the dissociation could also be mediated by post-translational modifications on both proteins, which could result in changes in complex formation.

the observation that hssb <dig> and blm re-associate after 2–3 h of dsb formation may however suggest a functional role in hr subsequent to end resection. although a role for hssb <dig> in later stage hr remains unclear, it should be noted that an association with the rad <dig> recombinase, a known interactor of blm, has been previously demonstrated  <cit> . indeed, our observation of increased chromatin co-localisation between hssb <dig> and blm  <dig> and 6 h post-ir exposure support a functional relevance of their interaction in hr. it will therefore be interesting to establish whether hssb <dig> and blm function together in the regulation of rad51-mediated strand invasion, as well as in the well-established roles of blm in double holliday junction dissolution  <cit> .

a similar interaction and co-localisation of hssb <dig> and blm was also observed following replication fork disruption by hu treatment. although the functional significance of this observation also remains unclear, roles for both of these proteins in such a response has been previously suggested . this includes the blm-mediated regression of replication forks and the generation of a ssdna invading strand for hr-mediated fork restart by hr  <cit> . as hssb <dig> also has been found to promote replication fork restart, the investigation of a potential role together in this process may also be of future value. the partial co-localisation between blm and hssb <dig> at nuclear structures following ir and hu treatment may be due to the fact that hssb <dig> is involved at multiple stages of hr and thus likely to be present in chromatin structures that have not yet recruited blm. thus the duration of time in which hssb <dig> and blm are present together at a dsb site may be very short and certainly requires further investigation in the future.

the exact nature of the blm: hssb <dig> complex also remains uncertain. as we were unable to detect a direct physical interaction between recombinant blm and hssb <dig>  it remains probable that other proteins instead mediate this association. this may include components of the core blm complex , as well as members of the larger basc super complex, which also includes msh <dig>  msh <dig>  mlh <dig>  atm, rfc and the mrn complex  <cit> . it is indeed worth noting that a direct interaction between hssb <dig> and the mrn component mre <dig> has been previously established, which may represent a plausible intermediate  <cit> . alternatively, we cannot exclude that a direct interaction between hssb <dig> and blm may occur in human cells, although requires specific post-translational modifications of blm or hssb <dig> that are not present in the recombinant protein. a full dissection of the blm–hssb <dig> association will however require additional experimentation.

an important observation of this study was the apparent dependence of blm protein stability on hssb <dig>  although we cannot conclude on the processes through which this occurs, it is noted that blm levels in hssb1-depleted cells were largely restored by proteasome inhibition with the compound mg- <dig>  it is therefore tempting to consider that hssb <dig> may promote blm stabilisation via its interaction with one of the blm complexes. alternatively, hssb <dig> may regulate cell signaling pathways that affect blm post translational modifications to prevent its degradation. indeed, blm was recently shown to be ubiquitinated by the e <dig> ligase mib <dig>  and interaction between blm and topbp <dig> prevented mib1–dependent degradation of blm  <cit> . the interaction between hssb <dig> and blm may act in a similar manner to prevent blm from proteasome mediated degradation. interestingly, hssb <dig> was recently shown to interact with both p <dig> and p <dig> and protect both proteins from ubiquitin-mediated degradation  <cit> . taken together, our current findings provide evidence for an additional, indirect means through which hssb <dig>  via regulation of blm helicase, promotes dsb repair and replication fork processing.

CONCLUSIONS
the findings described in this work suggest hssb <dig> as a novel component of blm complexes. these data thereby provide new insight into the regulation of blm and implicate an additional means through which hssb <dig> may promote genome stability in the cell.
