BACKGROUND
g protein-coupled receptors  can be divided into five subfamilies according to the grafs classification system: glutamate, rhodopsin, adhesion, frizzled/taste <dig> and secretin  <cit> . the adhesion gpcrs, also known as long n-terminal seven transmembrane receptors related to family b  and epidermal growth factor seven transmembrane  receptors. this family is the second largest gpcr family with  <dig> members in humans and  <dig> members in mice and rats. the endogenous ligands are discovered for bai <dig>  gpr <dig>  cd <dig> and emr <dig>  while the rest of the adhesion gpcrs remain orphans.

the adhesion receptors are characterized by long n-termini with complex domain architecture including gpcr proteolytic site , epidermal growth factor, thrombospondin, pentraxin, immunoglobulin, olfactomedin, cadherin domains  <cit> . several of the domains in the n-termini have been shown to have cell adhesion functions and to be responsible for cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions  <cit> . the gps domain is thought to be an intracellular cleavage motif, which is crucial for transport of the receptor from er to the membrane  <cit> . the adhesion gpcrs are cleaved into two parts: n-terminal and 7tm part with the c-terminal. nevertheless it has been reported that the n-terminal is responsible for ligand binding and is able to re-associate with the rest of the receptor and in this way initiate intracellular signalling cascade  <cit> . the genes coding for adhesion gpcrs are difficult to study due to their complex genomic structure and a large number of exons.

the adhesion gpcrs can be divided into seven groups according to phylogenetic analysis   <cit> . the brain angiogenesis inhibitors  1– <dig> form group i and are known to be mainly expressed in the brain. the n-terminal of bai receptors contains gps, hormone binding domain and thrombospondin repeats which are likely to be involved in the angiogenesis inhibitor function of bais. the role of bais in tumor suppression has been closely investigated as angiogenesis is an essential part of tumor formation  <cit> . bai <dig> has been recently reported as a receptor for phospatidylserine involved in recognition and internalization of apoptotic cells  <cit> . gpr <dig>  is another adhesion gpcr with a role in tumor development  <cit> . mutations in gpr <dig> have also been reported to cause human brain malformations  <cit> . it is described that gpr <dig> is able to build complex with cell-surface protein tetraspanin cd <dig> and gαq/ <dig> and is able to bind tissue transglutaminase, tg <dig>  <cit> .

gpr <dig> also called he <dig> , unlike gpr <dig>  has its only known function in the periphery and disruption of this gene results in mouse male infertility  <cit> . the very large g-protein-coupled receptor  is important for normal development of auditory hair bundles in the inner ear  <cit> . the functions of other five members of group ii are not known.

the adhesion receptors forming group iii can be divided into two groups according to the architecture of their n-termini. emr <dig>  emr <dig>  emr <dig>  emr <dig>  cd <dig> and etl receptors have all a variable number of epidermal growth factor  and calcium binding domains and are reported to be important components of the immune system  <cit> . emr <dig> and emr <dig> are missing in the mouse and rat genomes. cd <dig> and chondroitin sulphate have been described as ligands for cd <dig>  while chondroitin sulphate is also a ligand for emr <dig>  it is also suggested that egf domains in the n-termini of cd <dig> are essential for cd <dig> binding.  <cit> . lec <dig>  lec <dig> and lec <dig> on the other hand are proposed to play more central roles like synaptic cell adhesion  <cit>  and have a different repertoire of domains in the n-termini . lec <dig> has been reported to bind α-latrotoxin from black widow spider venom  <cit> .

gpr <dig>  gpr <dig> and gpr <dig> belong to group iv of adhesion gpcrs. gpr <dig> has been reported to have specific expression in the brain  <cit> . gpr <dig> was recently presented as a stem cell marker with a possible therapeutic use  <cit> . both these receptors have protein-protein interaction domains in the form of leucine rich repeats, while gpr <dig> and gpr <dig> have immunoglobulin domains in n-termini as well.

celsr1– <dig> receptors  have the most complex domain structure with cadherin repeats, two types of egf domains, laminin g and hormone binding domains. celsr receptors are thought to have crucial functions in cns development. mutations in celsr <dig> cause abnormal neural tube development in mice  <cit> . celsr <dig> and celsr <dig> seem to have opposite effects in neurite growth regulation; celsr <dig> is enhancing neurite growth while celsr <dig> is suppressing it.  <cit> . unlike celsr receptors, the members of group vi, gpr <dig> and gpr <dig> as well as group vii, gpr <dig>  gpr <dig>  gpr <dig>  gpr <dig> and gpr <dig> do not have any discovered function.

the majority of adhesion gpcrs are poorly studied, with specific expression patterns and physiological functions yet to be discovered. until today, the published expression data on many adhesion gpcr members is limited to a few tissues and is performed by different methods with varying sensitivity. therefore, an overall expression analysis of adhesion gpcrs is useful for comparison of expression and identifying specific patterns. it is also an important step towards finding the functions of the poorly studied receptors.

in this study we report an extensive tissue localization analysis of the entire adhesion gpcr family in rat and mouse. by applying the quantitative real-time pcr technique we have produced comparable expression patterns for each adhesion family member. we have compared expression patterns between rat and mouse and recent in situ hybridization data for mouse from the large allen brain atlas project  <cit>  as well as human and mouse ests  <cit> . we describe similarities in adhesion gpcr expression patterns between rat and mouse as well as within groups of adhesion gpcrs.

RESULTS
the mouse adhesion gpcr gene sequences were downloaded from genbank  and 7tm regions were identified with conserved domain database  <cit> . the tree calculations were carried out using clustalw alignment of tm regions, which was bootstrapped  <dig> times and distances were calculated with proml from phylip  <dig>  package. the maximum-likelihood consensus tree is presented in figure  <dig> 

we performed an expression analysis of  <dig> rat and mouse adhesion gpcr family members in a range of central and peripheral tissues. seven coronal sections of rat brain , a number of brain regions and peripheral tissues were isolated from mice and rats and used for rna isolation and cdna synthesis. the expression values of four housekeeping genes were used to calculate normalization factors for mouse and rat cdna. relative expression values displayed as a fold increase from the detected minimum expression for rat and mouse adhesion gpcrs are presented in figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  expression of bai <dig> and bai <dig> from group i was detected only in brain regions of rat and mouse. bai <dig> transcripts were detected mostly in brain, with very low levels in some peripheral tissues . the expression data of bai receptors is in agreement with previously published results  <cit> . gpr <dig>  gpr <dig>  gpr <dig> and vlgr <dig> from group ii were detected in central and peripheral tissues, whereas gpr <dig>  gpr <dig>  gpr <dig> and gpr <dig> were detected in peripheral tissues . the members of group iii lec <dig>  lec <dig>  lec <dig> and etl were expressed ubiquitously in both rat and mouse, whereas lec <dig> and lec <dig> had higher levels in cns compared to levels in the periphery . the members of group iii cd <dig>  emr <dig> and emr <dig> were detected mostly in peripheral tissues and at very low levels in the brain . the expression profile of receptors from adhesion group iii is in agreement with previous reports  <cit> . the member of group iv gpr <dig> displayed central expression, while the other members gpr <dig> and gpr <dig> showed ubiquitous expression . the members of group v celsr <dig> and celsr <dig> were detected mainly in cns, while celsr <dig> was found both in central and peripheral tissues . these results confirmed previously published expression data of celsr receptors  <cit> . group vi member gpr <dig> was detected in both cns and periphery . gpr <dig>  which is a pseudogene in rat, was not detected in any of the examined mouse tissues . group vii members gpr <dig>  gpr <dig>  gpr <dig> and gpr <dig> were detected in only few peripheral tissues . gpr <dig> was detected in all analyzed tissues, except blood, but mainly at low levels .

discussion
in this paper we present for the first time the expression chart of  <dig> members of adhesion gpcrs in mouse and rat. together with est data from human and mouse  <cit>  and previously published allen brain atlas in situ hybridization data  <cit>  this provides the most comprehensive information about the expression pattern of the adhesion family of gpcrs .

adhesion receptors is an evolutionary conserved group, for example an adhesion like genes have been described in fruit fly   <cit>  and in the choanoflagellate   <cit> . according to our phylogenetic analysis based on tm regions of adhesion receptors they formed seven groups , which is in agreement with previously published studies  <cit> . despite that phylogeny was based only on tm regions the n-termini of the receptors in each group had similar domain types and organization. surprisingly, our results showed that the members within each group also share considerable similarities in their expression profiles . so according to our results group i with bai <dig>  bai <dig>  bai3; group iv with gpr <dig>  gpr <dig>  gpr125; group v with celsr <dig>  celsr <dig>  celsr <dig> and even lec1– <dig> and etl <dig> which form a cluster within group iii showed predominant expression in the brain of rat and mouse .

the adhesion gpcr group containing gpr <dig>  gpr <dig> and gpr <dig> is one of the least studied groups. the detailed cns profile of gpr <dig> was recently published by lagerström et al. with some indications of important neuronal functions  <cit> . it is therefore very exciting that our results display wide expression in the rat and mouse brain for all  <dig> members of this group. in contrast to gpr <dig>  which displayed specific central expression, gpr <dig> and gpr <dig> displayed also very wide peripheral expression . it is very interesting that both the human and mouse ests for gpr <dig> are detected in stem cells and it was recently reported that gpr <dig> could be used therapeutically as a stem cell marker for generation of vessels  <cit> . the n-terminals of gpr <dig> and gpr <dig> contain gps, leucine-rich repeats, ig domain and hormone binding domain in contrast to gpr <dig>  which is lacking all of these domains. it is therefore tempting to speculate about if any of these domains have a role in peripheral actions of gpr <dig> and gpr <dig>  other proteins with leucine-rich repeats like lingo- <dig> and lrrk <dig> have been shown to play a role in structural and functional integrity of neurons involved in parkinson's disease  <cit> . the members of this group are present in teleosts  <cit> , amphioxus and fruit fly . as this group is present within most species with a nervous system and have a wide cns expression, members from this family could have their main function within the cns.

similarly to the centrally expressed adhesion gpcr genes, the genes expressed predominantly in peripheral tissues are also found in phylogenetic clusters. high levels of gpr <dig> transcripts were detected in stomach, and all parts of intestine. this is in agreement with the observation that the highest number of ests for gpr <dig> from human and mouse are found in the gastrointestinal  tract . the gpr <dig> is unlikely to play a role in immune system regulation as it is not detected in high levels in immune system specific organs. the gi specific expression profile of gpr <dig> could possibly indicate a function in cell migration during development of gi tract endothelium. two other genes from group ii, gpr <dig> and gpr <dig>  were also expressed in the gi tract but they were also detected at high levels in thymus, spleen and blood . in addition, the highest number of ests for these genes was detected in immune cells, spleen and bone marrow. altogether this indicates that gpr <dig> and gpr <dig> most probably are involved in functions of immune system in humans and rodents.

gpr <dig>  gpr <dig> and gpr <dig> from adhesion gpcr group ii displayed ubiquitous expression . gpr <dig> is most studied of these receptors. it is reported to play a role in development of human cerebral cortex  <cit>  as well as tumor development  <cit> . according to our results, the expression of gpr <dig> is highest in mouse pancreas and rat kidney. gpr <dig> has been described to regulate the function of the male reproductive system  <cit> . our results together with data from allen brain atlas  <cit>  display expression of gpr <dig> in hypothalamus, brain stem, substantia nigra and spinal cord. this was surprising to us as several publications have described gpr <dig> as an epididymal specific receptor. therefore it is likely that gpr <dig> could also have an additional function in cns.

mutations in vlgr <dig> are known to cause audiogenic seizures in mice  <cit> . hence vlgr <dig> expression in embryonic cns is widely described not only in mammals but also in other vertebrates like zebrafish  <cit> . interestingly, our results indicate that there are common expression sites of vlgr <dig> in zebrafish embryo and adult rat such as hypothalamus and eye . such similarity in expression patterns between mammals and teleosts points at remarkable conservation of function of the vlgr <dig> receptor during vertebrate evolution.

gpr <dig> and gpr <dig> are relatively recently discovered  <cit>  and poorly studied adhesion gpcrs. the presence of gpr <dig> like sequence  in purple sea urchin  indicates a long evolutionary history and an important physiological function. the expression of gpr <dig> was highest in intestine, skin, adipose tissue and olfactory bulb , which points toward a function in periphery. the inability to detect gpr <dig> transcripts in mouse tissues verifies that gpr <dig> is a murine pseudogene.

gpr <dig> is the only member of the adhesion gpcr group vii with ubiquitous expression . the expression profile of gpr <dig> with highest transcript levels in lung, olfactory bulb and heart is most similar to the etl and cd <dig> receptors. this could be a sign of functional similarities between these receptors. gpr <dig>  gpr <dig> and gpr <dig> have common expression site in the rat eye. two of these receptors, gpr <dig> and gpr <dig> also share expression in the rat skin. these receptors have similar structure in their n-termini and similar protein length. it is possible that these receptors play a role in similar peripheral functions like epithelial cell adhesion in eye epithelium and skin.

CONCLUSIONS
it is remarkable that phylogenetic clusters of adhesion gpcrs seem to have either predominant central or peripheral expression in rat and mouse tissues. though, it is also clear that within the phylogenetic clusters the expression profiles are not identical as adhesion gpcrs are expressed in a large number of tissues. if we analyze the functions of the well studied adhesion gpcrs, it is evident that even if the receptors from the same phylogenetic cluster do play roles in similar physiological processes, they do not have the same function and sometimes can even have opposite functions. one possible explanation for this is that adhesion receptors are very well conserved during evolution and sub-functionalization was a common process among phylogenetic clusters of adhesion gpcrs. adhesion receptors participate in highly complex processes like development of nervous system and immune system response. these processes require often a strict sequence of steps with different types of adhesion molecules participating at the different stages. altogether the adhesion gpcrs are a unique and fascinating family of membrane receptors with conserved evolutionary history and a number of vital physiological functions.
