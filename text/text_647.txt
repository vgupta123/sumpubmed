BACKGROUND
burkholderia pseudomallei is a saprophyte and the causative agent of melioidosis, a human infectious disease endemic in some tropical areas including southeast asia and northern australia  <cit> . inhalation is a recognized route of infection with this organism and pulmonary disease is common  <cit> . owing to its aerosol infectivity, the severe course of infection, and the absence of vaccines and fully effective treatments, b. pseudomallei is classified as a hazard category three pathogen and considered a potential biothreat agent  <cit> . b. pseudomallei, is a gram negative bacillus found in soil and water over a wide endemic area and mainly infects people who have direct contact with wet soil  <cit> . in thailand, the highest incidence of melioidosis is in the northeast region, at a rate of approximately  <dig> - <dig>  per  <dig>  human populations annually. septicaemic presentation of disease is associated with a high mortality rate   <cit> . a remaining enigma is that b. pseudomallei is commonly present in this region of thailand, but rarely found in other parts of the country or indeed other parts of the world  <cit> . of potential significance is the abundance of enclosed bodies of water with a high salt content and saline soils in the northeast region of thailand  <cit> . the electrical conductivity of salt-affected soil in northeast thailand is ranging between  <dig> to  <dig> ds/m, which is higher than normal soil from other parts of thailand  . an increase in salt concentration in these regions is believed to be caused both by natural phenomena and man-made activities  <cit> . one may speculate that the organism has developed an ability to thrive in saline conditions and as such has gained a selective ecological advantage over other soil dwelling micro organisms.

previously, it has been indicated that the killing efficiency of burkholderia species, including b. pseudomallei against the nematode caenorhabditis elegans was enhanced in a high osmolarity conditions  <cit> . this putative link between high salt concentration and an ability to withstand such conditions is evident in a subset of closely related organisms, namely, the b. cepacia complex . these are opportunistic pathogens of cystic fibrosis  sufferers  <cit>  where the lung airway surface liquid has been hypothesized an increased concentration of nacl  <cit> , that is typically 2-fold higher than in healthy lungs  <cit> . more recently, reports of a potential pathogenic role for b. pseudomallei in cf lung disease have been made  <cit> . to date, little is known of how elevated nacl concentrations affect b. pseudomallei.

as b. pseudomallei can survive and multiply under different environmental conditions and in various hosts  <cit> , it is likely that this organism has developed strategies to cope with high salt concentrations in both the natural environment and in its respective hosts. in the river water environment, osmolarity is believed to be less than  <dig> mm nacl whilst in the human lung it is normally  <dig> to  <dig> mm and in the blood the bacterium can encounter a concentration of up to  <dig> mm nacl  <cit> . recently, the secreted protein profile of b. pseudomallei following growth in salt-rich medium was revealed and provided a clue to the adaptive response of the organism to this stress  <cit> . increased secretion of several metabolic enzymes, stress response protein groel, beta-lactamase like proteins and potential virulence factors were noted. moreover, the effects of increasing salt concentration on the expression of a number of genes within the organism b. cenocepacia, formerly b. cepacia genomovar iii, a close relative of b. pseudomallei have been described  <cit> . genes found to be upregulated included an integrase, an nad-dependent deacetylase and an oxidoreductase amongst others. in pseudomonas aeruginosa, another close relative of b. pseudomallei, the up-regulation of genes associated with osmoprotectant synthesis, putative hydrophilins, and a type iii protein secretion system  after growth under steady-state hyperosmotic stress has been demonstrated  <cit> . high salt stress was also demonstrated to be one of the environmental stimuli affecting expression of the ysa t3ss in yersinia enterocolitica  <cit> . the b. pseudomallei strain k <dig> genome encodes three predicted t3sss, one related to the inv/mxi-spa systems of salmonella and shigella  and two related to systems found in plant bacterial pathogens . of these, only the bsa system appears to play a significant role in virulence in rodent models of melioidosis  <cit> , likely as a consequence of its effects on invasion, endosome escape and intracellular survival  <cit> . it is noteworthy that transcription of the invasion-associated salmonella pathogenicity island- <dig> genes homologous to the bsa locus is activated by the addition of nacl  <cit> . gaining an understanding of the ability of b. pseudomallei to survive in the presence of high salt concentrations is therefore significant, as this may provide insights into its pathogenicity and persistence in endemic areas.

here we used a genome-wide oligonucleotide microarray to quantify the transcription of b. pseudomallei genes in response to salt stress. differential regulation of a subset of genes was confirmed by rt-pcr and by analysis of production of the encoded proteins. our data reveal that exogenous nacl induces the virulence-associated bsa t3ss and the consequences of such for invasion of a <dig> cells were investigated.

RESULTS
b. pseudomallei growth was inhibited in high salt
to better understand the physiology of b. pseudomallei in response to elevated salt, we titrated the effect of salt on b. pseudomallei growth starting from salt-free luria bertani  medium and standard lb medium containing  <dig> mm plus various concentrations of nacl , and found that conditions with  <dig> and  <dig> mm nacl had severe impairment on b. pseudomallei growth . for lower nacl concentrations, the growth kinetics of b. pseudomallei k <dig> cultured in standard lb medium containing  <dig> or  <dig> mm nacl was similar until  <dig> hrs; the growth rate thereafter was impaired when cultured in lb broth containing  <dig> mm nacl . the doubling time in nacl-supplemented lb broth was calculated to be  <dig> ±  <dig>  min compared to  <dig> ±  <dig>  min in standard lb broth . in addition, we found that growth of b. pseudomallei in salt-free medium was faster than in standard lb medium supplemented with  <dig> and  <dig> mm nacl . this data indicated that increased nacl reduced the logarithmic growth rate of b. pseudomallei.

differential transcriptome of b. pseudomallei during growth in high salt
our studies indicated that growth of b. pseudomallei was severely impaired during culture at nacl concentrations of  <dig> and  <dig> mm . this suggested that these concentrations may be too high to detect salt-specific transcriptional changes. a previous study carried out in our laboratory demonstrated a significantly altered secretome when the organism was grown in  <dig> mm nacl compared to standard lb medium   <cit> . we therefore chose  <dig> and  <dig> mm nacl conditions for further investigation by microarray analysis. we elected to isolate rna from cultures at  <dig> and  <dig> hrs for transcriptome analysis because no significant difference in bacterial growth survival was noted at these time points . rna was stabilized and extracted immediately and analyzed for differential gene expression by hybridisation to a b. mallei/pseudomallei whole genome  <dig> mer oligonucleotide microarray version  <dig>  which containing  <dig>  reporters based on the b. mallei atcc  <dig>  b. mallei gb <dig> horse  <dig>  b. pseudomallei 1710b and b. pseudomallei k <dig> genome. four biological replicates generated for each sample clustered together indicating minimal experimental variation . anova statistical analysis and multiple testing correction identified  <dig> genes as significantly altered in their transcription . among the salt-regulated genes of b. pseudomallei identified in this study were a putative two-component system response regulator, bacterial metabolic enzymes, and hypothetical proteins. fold changes of altered genes at both  <dig> and  <dig> hrs ranged from  <dig> - <dig>  and  <dig> - <dig> , respectively. noticeably, a larger dynamic range of gene expression was observed after  <dig> hrs cultures, with the majority of the  <dig> genes being up-regulated.

* genes showed mean significant differences comparing between standard lb medium  and lb with  <dig> mm nacl using anova with a benjamini-hochberg multiple testing correction .

due to the stringent statistic analysis by anova and false discovery rate correction, it is possible that potentially significant trends were masked. owing to the effect of salt on loci encoding t3ss in pseudomonas, yersinia and salmonella, we examined the microarray data for effects on predicted type iii secretion-associated loci by only looking at the test ratio and standard deviation  and computing a confidence of that data point using a standard two tailed t-test . interestingly, a number of bsa-derived t3ss genes were found to have altered expression levels during culture in lb broth containing  <dig> mm nacl compared to standard lb at  <dig> hrs and  <dig> hrs  , in particular those encoding predicted secreted effectors and translocon components. we also found that the expression of beta-lactamase family protein  and groel  was upregulated in lb containing  <dig> mm nacl by approximately  <dig>  fold compared with those in standard lb broth at the  <dig> hrs time point  . in contrast genes encoding for t3ss- <dig> and t3ss- <dig>  did not show a significant difference in expression levels  .

* genes showed mean significant differences comparing between standard lb medium  and lb with  <dig> mm nacl using t-test .

by looking at the transcription of bsa-encoded genes, we were able to establish that nacl induces their expression. however it is possible that other t3ss effectors encoded elsewhere on the chromosome might be co-expressed with bsa genes in response to salt stress. to find other candidate t3ss effectors of b. pseudomallei, we used self organization maps  based on the transcription profiles of the genes encoding the effectors bopa and bope to identify  <dig> genes that had similar expression patterns  among the co-regulated genes were other bsa-associated genes . moreover, we also examined the direction and magnitude of transcription of predicted t3ss effectors that were previously proposed by haraga et al  <cit>  on the basis of homology with known effectors of other bacteria . the results showed that only the t3ss-associated genes encoded within the bsa locus appeared to be significantly induced under salt stress , with non-bsa putative effectors apparently being insensitive to exogenous nacl under the conditions tested. thus, we did not find any other candidate t3ss effectors among the genes co-regulated with bopa and bope, including those identified recently by haraga et al.  <cit> .

validation of the differential transcription of b. pseudomallei genes by exogenous salt
to validate the differential transcription of genes observed by microarray analysis, selected transcripts were amplified by rt-pcr and band intensities quantified by densitometric analysis. the experiments were performed in duplicate using total rna extracted from bacteria grown in salt-free lb, standard lb  and lb containing  <dig> mm nacl at  <dig> and  <dig> hrs post-inoculation. in all cases, rt-pcr analysis mirrored the timing and direction of change of transcription of the differentially transcribed genes identified by microarray analysis . in most cases the magnitude of the change was also comparable. thus, up-regulation of bpss <dig>  bpss <dig> and bpss <dig>  was confirmed to occur at  <dig> hrs but not  <dig> hrs in the presence of added nacl as found by microarray analysis . furthermore, the bsa-derived genes bpss <dig>  bpss <dig>  and bpss <dig>  were confirmed by rt-pcr to be upregulated in the presence of  <dig> mm nacl . increases for the bsa-derived genes occurred in a dose dependent manner, increasing from zero to  <dig> mm to  <dig> mm nacl .

the finding that genes encoding the bsa t3ss were induced under high salinity was also reflected in protein levels. when b. pseudomallei k <dig> was cultured in lb broth containing  <dig> mm nacl, expression and secretion of the invasion-associated type iii secreted proteins bipd and bope was enhanced when compared to standard lb, and in turn levels were higher than in salt-free medium . we observed a correlation between the increased expression of bope and bipd from almost salt-free medium to higher levels of salt suggesting the importance of salt in the induction of the t3ss. these patterns of induction were also noted in an independent b. pseudomallei strain designated  <dig>   <cit> . taken together, these findings imply that expression of the bsa t3ss of b. pseudomallei is enhanced by salt stress.

salt-stress increases invasion of host cells by b. pseudomallei
the ability of b. pseudomallei to invade non-phagocytic host cells is partly dependent on the bsa t3ss  <cit>  and is believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of melioidosis. owing to the induction of bsa genes by exogenous salt, we investigated whether salt stress affects invasion of b. pseudomallei into a <dig> human lung respiratory epithelial cells. overnight culture of b. pseudomallei in lb broth supplemented with nacl  led to significantly increased invasion into a <dig> cells relative to bacteria cultured in nacl-free lb broth  . we additionally showed a significant difference in invasion capacity between b. pseudomallei cultured in lb with  <dig> and  <dig> mm nacl . the invasion efficiency of b. pseudomallei grown in nacl-free lb was  <dig> % in contrast to, those of salt-treated bacteria . to our knowledge this is the first report revealing that salinity affects the ability of b. pseudomallei to invade host cells. although invasion was enhanced after overnight culture in salt-containing media, culturing b. pseudomallei in nacl supplemented medium up to  <dig> mm for either  <dig> or  <dig> hrs did not significantly affect the ability of the bacteria to invade a <dig> cells .

discussion
alterations in nacl content and therefore osmolarity in various environmental and host conditions are known conditions that most bacteria must counteract for survival  <cit> . at low concentrations, nacl is necessary for bacterial growth, however at high concentrations it is capable of causing considerable stress and even cell death. b. pseudomallei is an environmental saprophyte that can survive and multiply under difficult environmental conditions  <cit> . it is likely therefore that b. pseudomallei must have the mechanisms to sense changes in osmolarity in the environment and host, and to modulate its gene expression accordingly.

we found that at high salt concentration , there was no significant impairment in b. pseudomallei growth over a  <dig> hr period. this finding is consistent with observations in b. cenocepacia indicating that it can tolerate medium containing up to  <dig> mm nacl for  <dig> hrs  <cit> . in our study, two and eight genes were shown to be significantly up-regulated in b. pseudomallei grown in high salt for  <dig> and  <dig> hrs respectively, when compared with standard lb medium containing  <dig> mm nacl. of the  <dig> genes that show a salt-induced increase in transcription,  <dig> are clustered on chromosome  <dig>  which is enriched in genes mediating b. pseudomallei adaptation and virulence  <cit> . importantly, none of these genes were among the list of growth phase-regulated genes identified by microarray analysis of b. pseudomallei by rodrigues et al  <cit> . this implies that the altered transcription levels detected in this study are a reflection of the salt stress and not impairment of growth.

although highly stringent statistical analysis identified only a small number of transcriptionally salt-altered b. pseudomallei genes, our data did correlate with previous findings in other bacteria. remarkably, it has been reported that an adenylate cyclase  acts as an osmosensor in the gram negative saprophytic bacterium myxococcus xanthus  <cit> . we found a  <dig>  fold increase in the expression of a b. pseudomallei k <dig> adenylate cyclase gene  during exposure to high salt for  <dig> hrs which decreased again later. we postulate therefore that adenylate cyclase might function as an osmosensor in b. pseudomallei, or be involved in the transmission of the signal. for the formyltetrahydrofolate deformylase-derived gene  that was also upregulated at  <dig> hrs may function in the same manner. in addition, another study by bhatt and weingart  <cit>  reported that an oxidoreductase encoding gene  has been found to be regulated in response to increasing nacl concentrations in b. cenocepacia. a putative oxidoreductase encoding gene  in b. pseudomallei k <dig> was also up-regulated  under salt stress. however, the exact role that oxidoreductases play in adaptation to osmotic stress is still unknown.

a study into the salt stress response of azospirillum brasilense, a gram-negative nitrogen-fixing bacterium associated with various plants, found an increase in the expression levels of its acyl-coa dehydrogenase coding gene  <cit> . several reports indicate that acyl-coa dehydrogenases are involved in the changes of bacterial membrane fluidity during salt tolerance  <cit> . our study identified an increased level of expression of bpss <dig> also coding for acyl-coa dehydrogenase domain protein  suggesting that acyl-coa dehydrogenase may play a role in response to high salt stress. we hypothesise that this role may be in modulation of the membrane layer when b. pseudomallei encounters high salt.

as osmotic shock was found to increase expression of t3ss in various pathogens  <cit> , we also sought to obtain information on the effect of salt on transcription of the t3sss of b. pseudomallei. much research has been carried out on the bsa t3ss of b. pseudomallei, demonstrating its critical role in pathogenesis and more precisely in escaping the phagosome  <cit> , but few substrates secreted by this system have been identified  <cit> . we used a two tailed unpaired t-test to identify genes significantly up-regulated at  <dig> hrs. our finding that the bsa-derived genes, in particular those encoding secreted translocon and effector proteins, are upregulated in the presence of salt by both microarray and rt-pcr analysis mirrors the ability of exogenous nacl to activate t3ss in other bacteria. t3ss genes encoding for structural components, translocators and effectors in p. aeruginosa were upregulated under steady-state hyperosmotic stress  <cit> , as were salmonella typhimurium spi- <dig> genes encoding t3ss- <dig> translocon proteins in the presence of exogenous nacl  <cit> . interestingly, by t-test we also found that b. pseudomallei grown in high salt upregulated genes encoding a beta-lactamase family protein  and groel . the increased expression of these genes correlates with the report of increased beta-lactamase family and groel proteins detection in the b. pseudomallei secretome under high salinity  <cit> . conversely, none of b. pseudomallei genes encoded for within t3ss- <dig>  t3ss- <dig>  and other virulence factors  were altered under salt stress in our study .

previously, moore et al.  <cit>  demonstrated a functional link between the ability to assimilate l-arabinose and repression of the bsa-derived type iii secretion genes, which the authors found may account for the differential virulence of ara-plus and -minus biotypes. moore et al.  <cit>  also analysed the global transcriptome of b. pseudomallei in the presence or absence of the ara operon to identify genes that may be co-regulated with the bsa apparatus. it is noteworthy that bsan, a predicted positive transcriptional regulator of the bsa genes is up-regulated  <dig>  fold at  <dig> hrs in nacl-supplemented medium , and further studies will be required to unravel the role of bsan and other regulators in salt induction of t3ss genes.

a recent study generated a list of putative t3ss effectors in b. pseudomallei by comparing predicted coding sequences to known bacterial effectors including salmonella and shigella effector proteins  <cit> . our investigation could not detect the co-regulation of these putative effector genes, such as a putative proline-rich exposed protein and atp/gtp binding protein, with respect to salt stress in contrast to secreted effectors encoded within the bsa locus.

in an attempt to identify genes that may be co-regulated with the virulence-associated bsa system under salt stress, we used self organization maps based on bopa and bope expression to find  <dig> genes with similar expression patterns. these transcriptional changes showed an up-regulation of genes associated with various bacterial functions not only t3ss but also metabolism, stress response, and membrane transportation. one of these genes was the bsa t3ss translocator bipb, which is involved in b. pseudomallei survival within macrophages  <cit> . likewise, we also found the up-regulation of the rpoe regulatory gene, mucb. the sigma factor e  has previously been reported to play a role in the response to environmental stress tolerance such as hyperosmolarity in b. pseudomallei  <cit> . recently, it has been suggested that rpoe and algr in p. aeruginosa may coordinate regulation of the t3ss and the alginate biosynthesis pathway  <cit> . such a link between rpoe-regulating mucb and salt-induction of the bsa system may exist in b. pseudomallei, but further studies will be required to investigate this.

the salt-induced transcription of the invasion- and virulence-associated genes bipd and bope, which respectively encode a translocon component  <cit>  and a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that subverts actin dynamics  <cit> , was confirmed to result in increased production and secretion of the proteins by western blotting using specific antisera. bipd and bope protein expression increased in a gradient from  <dig> mm to  <dig> mm to  <dig> mm nacl at both rna and protein levels at both  <dig> and  <dig> hrs. this provides compelling evidence that the two genes are regulated by nacl concentration. bipd and bope both contribute to invasion of non-phagocytic cells  <cit>  and mutation of bipd markedly impairs the virulence of b. pseudomallei following intranasal or intraperitoneal inoculation of inbred mice  <cit> . consistent with induction of these genes, invasion of a <dig> cells was enhanced following overnight culture in salt-supplemented lb medium in a manner partly dependent on a functional bsa system. likewise, it has been reported in pseudomonas aeruginosa under steady-state growth that high salt could induce the t3ss  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that an overnight culture of b. pseudomallei could induce the t3ss and other factors that might contribute in increase invasion efficiency. our result is in good agreement with a previous report that s. typhi cultured in  <dig> mm nacl containing lb broth exhibited an increased secretion of invasion proteins  . also, this salt-treated s. typhi became highly invasive toward both epithelial cells and m cell of rat peyer's pathches .

CONCLUSIONS
this study revealed that b. pseudomallei responds to high salt/osmolarity by modulating the transcription of specific genes. most of identified genes are within chromosome  <dig>  among these are several loci that are known to contribute to the pathogenesis of melioidosis, including the invasion-associated bsa t3ss.
