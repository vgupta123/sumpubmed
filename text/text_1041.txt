BACKGROUND
the abo blood group system was the first genetic polymorphism discovered in humans. it consists of three alleles: two co-dominant a and b alleles, and one silent and recessive o allele <cit> . the system is controlled by a single gene at the abo locus. this gene encodes a glycosyltransferase enzyme that adds a sugar residue to a carbohydrate structure known as the h antigen, that is present in the membrane of red cells as well as most epithelial and endothelial cells. the a allele codes for an enzyme that adds a n-acetyl galactosamine to the h antigen, while the b allele, which differs from the former by four amino acid changes, codes for an enzyme that adds a d-galactose. the o allele occurs most frequently in modern humans and carries a human-specific inactivating mutation which produces a non-functional enzyme, and thus the h antigen remains without further modification on the surface of the cells  <cit> . the combination of the three abo alleles results in four major phenotypes, named a, b, ab and o, these carry different antigens  that react with specific antibodies  <cit> .

the abo gene is organized in  <dig> exons that range in size from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides, with exon  <dig> and  <dig> being the largest  <cit> . further analyses of the abo gene have shown that, at the nucleotide sequence level, numerous haplotypes exist among modern humans <cit> . the main a and b alleles  differ by four amino acid changes at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> , with the two later being determining the a and b specificity of the enzyme. the most frequent among all human abo alleles is the o allele  <cit> . the most frequent o haplotypes, o <dig> and o <dig>  share a single g nucleotide deletion in position  <dig> of exon  <dig>  that creates a premature stop codon and results in a truncated protein with no enzymatic activity  <cit> ; they are referred as the o  alleles below. the o <dig> haplotypes differ from the o <dig> haplotypes by at least six nucleotide substitutions, including position  <dig> in exon  <dig>  which is a in the former and g in the latter.

many studies have examined the association between the abo alleles and a variety of diseases  <cit> , mainly focussed on infectious agents that can use the a and b antigens as receptors, or in case of the o allele, the absence of the a and b antigens. the o allele can provide a selective advantage since it also produces both anti-a and anti-b antibodies  <cit> . in particular, it has been suggested that the o allele protects against severe malaria  <cit> . at the same time, it can be more sensitive to helicobacter pylori infections  <cit>  and to severe forms of cholera  <cit> . the complex pattern of putative selective agents favouring or acting against different alleles could explain the maintenance of the high abo polymorphism  <cit> , as evidenced by the signal of balancing selection detected on the gene  <cit> . therefore studying the evolution of the abo blood groups to determine when during human history the different alleles emerged may contribute to our understanding on what selective forces might have worked on the different alleles.

within the apes a convergent evolution of the different blood groups can be observed, although no ape displays all three phenotypes known in humans  <cit> . whereas all gorillas studied to date carry only an allele that has properties similar to the human b allele, our closest living relative, the chimpanzee carries two alleles corresponding to the human a and o. both alleles in the chimpanzee are characterized by species specific mutations in the abo gene that are distinct from those found in humans  <cit> . for the abo alleles on the human lineage it has been estimated that the b <dig> allele, which gave rise to all the b variants, derived from the ancestral a <dig> allele around  <dig>  million years ago   <cit> , whereas the youngest and most common human allele o <dig>  carrying the Δ <dig> deletion, derived from the a allele only about  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mya determined by coalescence analysis  <cit> . the emergence of the abo allele o <dig> therefore predates the mean divergence time for modern humans and neandertals estimated to more than  <dig> kya  <cit>  and opens the possibility to put a lower limit on the estimated coalescence date by directly testing for the presence of the o <dig> allele in the neandertal population. thus we undertook a targeted approach to determine whether the Δ <dig> deletion in the o allele was also present in neandertals and by that testing the emergence of the o <dig> allele in the common ancestor of modern human and neandertal.

methods
dna extraction and amplification
we analysed two neandertal samples from the el sidrón site   <cit>  that were extracted in  <dig> under controlled conditions  <cit>  and immediately frozen, prior to sending them to the dedicated ancient dna laboratories in both barcelona and leipzig, where dna extractions were performed. about  <dig> mg of cortical bone was removed, powdered and extracted as described  <cit> .

analysis of specific nuclear dna loci from ancient neandertal remains by the polymerase chain reaction  is a challenging task that presents two main limitations: the small quantity and short length of ancient dna fragments due to the degradation of the original template molecules and the difficulty in distinguishing between endogenous neandertal dna and putative contemporary modern human contaminants. however, the presence of single informative substitutions in the abo gene allows for characterization of the different alleles even when retrieving short dna sequences. also, the co-amplification of mitochondrial dna  and nuclear markers allow us to control for the presence of human contamination in the extracts.

two-step multiplex pcrs  <cit>  in a total volume of  <dig> μl were set up and incubated for  <dig> minutes at room temperature with  <dig>  units of shrimp nuclease  to degrade any double-stranded dna that may contaminate the reagents  <cit> . after inactivating the nuclease for  <dig> minutes at 65°c,  <dig> μl of extract and taqgold dna polymerase were added to the pcr. twenty-seven cycles of pcr were performed in the first pcr and  <dig> cycles in the second pcr. reaction conditions were as described  <cit>  except for the annealing temperature, which was 53–55°c, depending on the primers used.

the informative Δ <dig> position in exon  <dig> was amplified with the f20144-aggaaggatgtcctcgtgg, r20163-tgccctcccagacaatgg primer couple . the  <dig> position in exon  <dig>  further retrieved to determine to which of the two main o haplotypes  the specimens belonged, was amplified with the f20173-ttggctggctcccattgtctgg, r20194-gaactgctcgttgaggatg primer couple. the pcr products were  <dig> and  <dig> bp in length, respectively. in barcelona, amplification products of the correct size were cloned using the topo ta cloning kit , and several clones from each product were sequenced using an abi <dig> capillary sequencer  following the manufacturer's instructions. in leipzig, the products from each pcr were pooled and ligated with a specific tagging sequence for each pcr as described  <cit>  and subsequently sequenced on a  <dig> flx machine.

contamination controls
to determine the degree of modern human contamination in the neandertal dna extracts we amplified and sequenced, using conserved primers, one position in the mitochondrial dna  coding region  from each neandertal extract where neandertals were found to be distinct from modern humans  <cit> , as well as two diagnostic mtdna hypervariable region i  fragments between positions  <dig> – <dig>  and  <dig> – <dig> . to ensure that the copy number of nuclear dna is sufficient for amplifying nuclear neandertal dna and to monitor potential nuclear dna contamination we additionally amplified a control position on the y-chromosome, which was previously described as ancestral in both specimens and defines the deepest clade in the human y-chromosome tree . this clade is comprised of all modern human y chromosomes haplogroups outside africa. successful amplifications of the y chromosomal control fragment confirmed that the two specimens labeled  <dig> and 1351c come from two different male individuals  <cit> .

RESULTS
in barcelona, position  <dig> on exon  <dig> in the  <dig> specimen was amplified in four independent pcrs in parallel with the mtdna controls  and the nuclear y-chromosome position. the products were cloned and at least  <dig> clones sequenced. the sequences from all four products for the  <dig> specimen  showed the Δ <dig> deletion, which defines the o alleles. all y <dig> sequences  were found to be ancestral , while  <dig> out of  <dig> mtdna sequences were neandertal-specific. we further amplified and sequenced position  <dig> on exon  <dig>  twelve sequences display an a at position  <dig>  which is compatible with the most frequent o haplotype, the o <dig>  but not with the other, the o <dig>  <cit> . the position  <dig> on exon  <dig> was also amplified in four independent pcrs from the specimen 1351c along with the y <dig> fragment and the informative mtdna position  <dig> . all the abo sequences  were identical to those found in the  <dig> specimen, while all y <dig> sequences  were ancestral, and  <dig> out of  <dig> mtdna sequences were neandertal specific .

: deletion in position  <dig>  : g in position  <dig>  : a in position  <dig>  : g in position  <dig>  : y chromosome basal marker. : ancestral. : mtdna nucleotide position  <dig> . : neandertal. : modern human. : mtdna hypervariable region  <dig>  : barcelona; : leipzig. : no amplification product obtained. : no amplification attempted.

in leipzig, position  <dig> and position  <dig> on exon  <dig> in specimen  <dig> were amplified in two independent 2-step multiplex pcrs together with one of the informative mtdna fragments . all sequences for the  <dig> fragment in the first pcr show Δ <dig> , for  <dig> of the sequences we find a additional c > t substitution at position  <dig>  a substitution at that position was not found in any other pcr product from leipzig or barcelona and is likely to derive from a miscoding lesion caused by deamination of cytosine on the ancient molecule  <cit> . for the second pcr from specimen  <dig>   <dig> sequences were found to carry the Δ <dig> and  <dig> displayed a g at that position . at position  <dig> an a was found in all clones from the first pcr, while in the second pcr most of the sequences  display an a and others  a g . for specimen 1351c, just one pcr resulted in a product covering position  <dig> where some sequences displayed the Δ <dig>  and some showed no deletion . all the sequences  in the two independent pcrs for specimen 1351c showed an a at position  <dig> 

between 82% and 85% neandertal sequences were found for the informative mtdna fragments that were co-amplified along the abo positions. despite the informative transversion at position  <dig>  where humans have a a and neandertals a c, there is a second diagnostic position,  <dig> , present in that fragment where most humans have a g and neandertals an a  <cit> . all clones for the mtdna fragments show either the  <dig> a- <dig> g or the  <dig> c- <dig> a haplotype, allowing to determine whether they derived from human or neandertal, respectively. there is also a number of transitions present in a minority of the mtdna sequences that are almost all either c > t or g > a substitutions typical for miscoding lesions  <cit> . furthermore we find a number of insertions and deletions close to homopolymers, a known problem of the  <dig> technology  <cit> . only little post-mortem damage was found in the nuclear sequences retrieved in leipzig and barcelona , which can be attributed to the small number of individual clone sequences obtained, the short length of the amplified product and a low molecule starting number for the pcr. the later explanation is supported by some unsuccessful amplifications in both barcelona and leipzig, and also by the almost equal ratio of clones that show the c > t transition at position  <dig> for one of the  <dig> fragments, suggesting the pcr started only from two initial dna molecules .

the low level of modern human mtdna contamination and the fact that from both specimens ancestral y chromosomal positions could be repeatedly retrieved suggest that the majority of the abo fragments amplified in this study derive from neandertal nuclear dna. since nine out of eleven successful amplifications of position  <dig> from both neandertals only displayed the informative deletion for allele o, we conclude that this allele was present in the neandertal population. since four out of five amplifications of position  <dig> only displayed an a at that position, it is likely that the haplotype was o <dig>  if we assume that our amplifications just start from single molecules and that our neandertals are heterozygous at position  <dig>  it seems quite unlikely to observe only one of six and one of five pcrs for the second individual without the Δ <dig> . given an average contamination rate of  <dig> % with a probability of carrying either the a or the b allele of  <dig>   the chances of this observation would increase .

CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that the two el sidrón neandertal individuals were most likely homozygous for the o <dig> allele. nevertheless given a low rate of potential modern human contaminants in an unknown allelic state, we cannot discard the possibility that both neandertals could have been heterozygous . the results however suggest the presence of the human o <dig> allele already in the common ancestor of neandertals and modern humans and thereby confirming an emergence of the o <dig> allele more than  <dig> mya predating the divergence of the modern human and neandertal populations. an alternative possibility would be that neandertals have acquired this allele by gene flow from modern humans, although at present, other genetic evidences suggest that this scenario is unlikely  <cit> . furthermore a potentially homozygous state in at least two neandertals, even though from the same group, at least indicates that a potential selective advantage of the o allele could have also been present in the neandertal population. future analyses regarding the frequency of the abo alleles will be necessary to reveal if all three genotypes were conserved in the neandertal population.
