BACKGROUND
es cell lines that maintain their pluripotency after transfection and selection procedures are essential for the introduction of selected targeted mutations into the mouse germ-line. pluripotent es cells are established in vitro from the inner cell mass  cells of explanted blastocyst-stage embryos  <cit> . murine es cells are maintained in a pluripotent state by co-culturing with mitotically-inactivated feeder cells, such as embryonic fibroblasts, and/or the addition of leukaemia inhibitory factor . these es cells can be maintained indefinitely in the presence of lif, and express markers of the undifferentiated and pluripotent state, including the pou-domain transcription factor oct-3/ <dig> , a factor that is essential for the development of the icm . upon removal of lif, the cells rapidly lose self-renewal capacity and differentiate into a variety of cell types. lif belongs to the interleukin- <dig> family of cytokines and the members of this family have diverse effects on a variety of cell types  <cit> . the shared usage of signal transducers  in the multichain cytokine receptor complexes clearly explains the functional redundancies of these cytokines .

the pathway by which lif signalling acts to promote es cell self-renewal has been partially well studied . lif signals via heterodimerization of the two class i cytokine receptors, the low affinity lif receptor  and the common subunit, gp <dig>  the cytoplasmic domain of gp <dig> contains several tyrosinase residues that are phosphorylated by associated jak  kinases after ligand-stimulated dimerization. four of these phosphorylated tyrosines have been identified as putative interaction sites with the sh <dig>  domain of the transcription factor stat <dig> . stimulation of gp <dig> signalling in es cells also phosphorylates shp- <dig>  and leads to activation of the mitogen-activated protein  kinases erk <dig> and erk <dig>  <cit> . inhibition of the shp-2/ras/erk pathway promotes self-renewal and suppresses differentiation and treatment of mouse es cells with the mapk-inhibitor pd <dig>  <cit>  was shown to enhance self-renewal  <cit> .

matsuda et al.  have shown that activation of the stat <dig> transcription factor is sufficient to maintain mouse es cells in an undifferentiated state in the absence of lif  <cit> : an inducible transgene construct encoding the entire stat <dig> coding region fused to the mutated ligand-binding domain of the estrogen receptor  was introduced into es cells. es cells expressing the stat3-mer fusion protein maintained their undifferentiated state in the presence of oht and in the absence of lif  <cit> . this study highlighted the importance of stat <dig> pathway in maintenance of es cell pluripotency in vitro. however, the in vivo relevance of the lif pathway is to date still not clear; lif expression can be detected in the trophectoderm  of the blastocyst whereas lif receptor is expressed in the icm. however, neither lif mutants  <cit>  nor mutants of the receptors lifr  <cit>  and gp <dig>  <cit>  result in any defects in the development of the icm or early epiblast. recent evidence suggests that the lif pathway is necessary for survival of the mouse epiblast during diapause  <cit> .

es cell lines derived from different mouse strains exhibit variable degrees of lif dependency as demonstrated in stat <dig> gene targeting experiments by raz et al.  <cit> . es cells heterozygous for a stat <dig> mutation could only be established from e <dig> cells . targeted clones from other cell lines were invariably trisomic for chromosome  <dig> that carries the stat <dig> locus, and thus retained normal levels of activated stat <dig> 

to date it is unclear if higher amounts of stat <dig> in the inner cell mass of blastocyst support the survival and derivation of pluripotent es cells, especially in so called non-permissive mouse strains like fvb/n. the inbred mouse strain fvb/n is widely used for the generation of transgenic animals  <cit> , however only one germline competent es cell line has been reported  <cit> . we therefore, in a first step, generated fvb/n transgenic mice overexpressing a tamoxifen inducible stat <dig> . our data demonstrated that overexpression of stat <dig> in the icm of the blastocyst supports the establishment of es cells in the fvb/n mouse strain. es cell lines overexpressing stat3-mer were germline-competent whereas the only wt line that we could establish was not germline-competent.

recent studies have begun to identify key players involved in the intracellular signal transduction pathways regulating stem cell renewal and proliferation. several transcription factors including the oct-3/ <dig> have been shown to be essential to maintain pluripotency in the icm, but none had been shown to function independently of the lif pathway with exception of the newly identified homeobox transcription factor nanog, that directs pluripotency in mouse icm and mouse es cells and functions independently from lif dependent stat <dig> activation  <cit> . nanog is detected in the icm and early germ cells, as well as in the es and embryonic carcinoma  cell lines derived from these stages  <cit> . overexpression of nanog relieves mouse es cells cultured without feeder cells in the presence of serum from dependence on lif stimulation for self-renewal whereas nanog-deficient mouse es cells loose pluripotency and differentiate into extra embryonic endoderm lineages  <cit> .

we have further focused our study on the stat <dig> pathway in order to elucidate the differences between wt and stat <dig> overexpressing embryonic stem cells. we performed microarray-analysis comparing wt and stat3-mer overexpressing fvb/n es cells and identified a pool of genes that were differentially expressed. from the microarray dataset, we screened for potential candidates of pluripotency by their expression pattern in the early preimplantation embryo. among these, we confirmed pem/rhox <dig> and pramel <dig> as regulators of pluripotency using functional studies: es cells overexpressing pem/rhox <dig> and pramel <dig> were able to maintain typical pluripotent es cell morphology in the absence of lif, as well as the characteristic pluripotency-related markers ssea- <dig> and oct <dig> in a similar extent as nanog which was used as a positive control. this clearly demonstrates that these two stat3-pathway related genes are involved in the maintenance of pluripotency.

RESULTS
generation of transgenic mice overexpressing stat3-mer
we produced fvb/n transgenic mice overexpressing a fusion protein composed of the entire coding region of mouse stat <dig> and the modified ligand-binding domain  of the mouse estrogen receptor  <cit> . the modified ligand-binding domain binds the synthetic steroid ligand 4-hydroxytamoxifen  but not 17β-estradiol  <cit> . the expression of the transgene is driven by a chicken β-actin promoter and therefore is expected to be ubiquitously expressed. after injection of the construct into the pronucleus of fertilized fvb/n eggs we obtained seven positive founder animals. when crossed with wild-type fvb/n partners, six of them showed germline transmission. a multiple tissue analysis was performed, by western blotting, in order to define animals exhibiting ubiquitous expression . two of highest stat3-mer expressing lines  were selected for further experiments. both transgenic lines contained a single integration of the transgenic cluster and were maintained in a hemizygous state by constant breeding with wt fvb/n mice.

overexpression of inducible active stat3-mer enables the establishment of germline competent es cells from fvb/n blastocysts
in order to test if the overexpression of stat3-mer would allow the establishment of germline competent es cells from the fvb/n mouse strain, morulae were flushed from the uterotubal junction  <dig> days after mating and cultured overnight in m <dig> medium . fully expanded blastocysts were transferred onto mef as described in "methods". full-grown icms were picked from the outgrown te and dissociated mechanically into groups of cells and these aggregates reseeded onto embryonic feeder fibroblasts. 3– <dig> days later, compact stem cell colonies could be identified. single colonies were dissociated as described above and reseeded. non-differentiating clonal lines were further passaged and split after 2– <dig> generations for further characterization. embryos were cultivated in medium containing either lif or oht. we were able to establish both wild type and transgenic es cell lines. however, even if icms from wt embryos were able to outgrowth from the te in presence of oht it was impossible to generate es cell colonies during the further steps of cultivation and wt es cells were only obtained when lif was present in the medium . when using oht-supplemented medium without lif 43–71% of the embryos from both tg <dig> and tg <dig> transgenic lines yielded es cell lines, all of which were transgenic . because the mice used were hemizygous for the transgene, and therefore only 50% of the embryos is expected to be transgenic, it is fair to assume that we were able to derive es cells from virtually all the transgenic embryos. these results strongly indicate a supportive effect of active stat3-mer on the maintenance of pluripotent es cells. the newly established es cell lines overexpressing stat3-mer were cultivated further only in presence of oht without lif. in order to confirm the pluripotency of these es cells, karyotypically normal male cells from both transgenic lines  were injected into c57bl/ <dig> host blastocysts. chimeric males were identified by the absence of eye  and coat  pigmentation and mated to wildtype fvb/n females. germline transmission of the fvb/n es cell genome resulted in albino offspring . none of the  <dig> fvb wt es cell lines was able to produce chimeras when injected into c57bl/ <dig> blastocysts . to confirm that overexpression of active stat <dig> supports the survival and derivation of pluripotent es cells also in the f <dig> generation, transgenic germline f <dig> offspring from the line tg <dig> were mated to wildtype animals. blastocyst stage embryos were isolated and cultivated as previously described, if cultivated in presence of oht stem cell lines could be established from 44% of the embryos, all lines being transgenic .

wt fvb/n or hemizygous fvb/n males carrying the stat3-mer transgene  were mated with wt fvb/n females. blastocysts were cultivated either in presence of lif or oht. outgrown icm's were picked and cultivated till es cell colonies were visible. cells were tested for the presence of the transgene by pcr analysis. as expected it was possible to establish wt es cells only in presence of lif but not when oht alone was added to the culture. furthermore in presence of oht both transgenic lines  <dig> and  <dig> generated es cell colonies that were carrying the transgene. because theoretically only 50% of the blastocysts were expected to be transgene it is to assume that the establishment frequency was almost 100%. after generation of germline competent chimera with the newly established  <dig> cell line hemizygous transgenic f <dig> animals were generated and mated with wt fvb/n females. in this breeding the establishment efficiency in presence of oht was similar to one observed in the parental blastocysts indicating that the stat3-mer induced stabilization is kept also in the f <dig> generation.

characterization of the newly established fvb/n es cells overexpressing stat3-mer
the expression level of stat3-mer in the es clones obtained from the line  <dig>  was tested by western blot . upon lif stimulation stat <dig> is phosphorylated on the tyrosine residue , dimerizes and can bind dna  <cit> . in order to test if oht is able to induce stat3-mer phosphorylation fvb/n es cells expressing stat3-mer were first deprived of lif or oht for  <dig> hrs, after this time the tyr <dig> residues of both the endogenous stat <dig> and stat3-mer were completely dephosphorylated. after the  <dig> hrs deprivation cells were stimulated either with lif or oht for  <dig> minutes up to  <dig> hours and further cultivated in presence of lif or oht till their homogenization. cell extracts were separated by sds-page, blotted and probed with anti-stat <dig> and anti-phospho  antibodies. lif stimulation induced tyrosine phosphorylation of both endogenous stat <dig> and stat3-mer . as previously observed  <cit> , endogenous stat <dig> was rapidly phosphorylated whereas phosphorylation kinetics of stat3-mer were slower. in es cells derived from tg <dig> stimulation with oht resulted in a strong tyrosine phosphorylation of stat3-mer, but only a limited phosphorylation could be detected for endogenous stat <dig> . during the  <dig> hours of induction with either lif or oht expression of oct <dig> was confirmed . dephosphorylation kinetic of tyr <dig> was also analyzed by eliminating lif or oht from the medium of respectively wt or  <dig> cells. kinetics for the dephosphorylation were slower then for the phosphorylation, only after  <dig> hrs dephosphorylation of wt tyr <dig> was complete whereas complete dephosphorylation of stat3-mer occurred only after  <dig> hrs. dose dependence for dephosphorylation could also be observed. in es cells derived from the tg <dig> line, expressing higher amounts of stat3-mer, dephosphorylation was slower compared to cells derived from the lower expressing tg <dig> line .

es cells overexpressing stat3-mer express the typical es-cell markers
es cells, as well as cells of the icm of mouse blastocysts, express a panel of markers that are used to characterize undifferentiated, pluripotent embryonic cells, between them nanog, alkaline phosphatase, oct-3/ <dig> and ssea- <dig> are the most typically used. nanog expression was tested by rtq-pcr; both wt and  <dig> es cells expressed nanog and a light overexpression could be detected in the  <dig> cells if compared with wt cells after normalization with the housekeeping gene β-actin . the expression of the transcriptional factor oct-3/ <dig> and the surface marker ssea- <dig> was tested by immunohistochemistry ; wt fvb as well as both transgenic lines  <dig> and  <dig> expressed both markers. furthermore, all three cell lines expressed the marker alkaline phosphatase . in all cases the expression was restricted to the es cells and no signal could be detected in the inactivated fibroblast used as feeder cells.

microarray analysis
even though it was possible to establish wt fvb es cells in presence of lif and these cells express the typical markers for es cells they were not able to generate chimeric mice. this suggests that overexpression of stat3-mer could increase the level of pluripotency in fvb es cells. in order to understand the difference between the wt cells and the germline competent  <dig> cells we decided to compare the gene expression profiles of both lines. we compared three independently cultivated dishes of wt fvb cells cultivated in the presence of lif with three independently cultivated dishes of the transgenic  <dig> cells overexpressing stat3-mer cultivated in the presence of oht. total rna was isolated and an expression analysis was performed by hybridizing u74v <dig> affymetrix chips containing probes covering the complete mouse transcriptome . analysis was performed with dchip by using both the pm/mm  difference model and the pm  only model in order to compare the results  <cit> . genes showing expression changes higher then  <dig>  fold were considered. as control, we first confirmed that the overexpression of stat3-mer in the  <dig> line was  <dig> times higher than in the wt cells. we further identified a set of  <dig> differentially regulated genes,  <dig> were upregulated  whereas  <dig> were downregulated .

genes upregulated after stat3-mer activation through oht. microarray values are given as fold changes ratios relative to normalization derived from dchip.  <dig> genes were found to be significantly upregulated when compared with wt fvb/n cells cultivated in presence of lif. only genes with a  <dig> × fold increase were considered as significant. the mrna expression levels  of relative to fvb wt control cells were validated by real time pcr analysis, rtq-pcr values are ratios relative to β-actin  expression. for all selected genes measured, rt-pcr corroborated the rank order of magnitude of expression measured on the microarrays. calculations were performed with both the pm/mm  difference model and the pm  only model in order to compare the results.

genes downregulated after stat3-mer activation through oht.  <dig> genes were found to be significantly downregulated when compared with wt fvb/n cells cultivated in presence of lif. only genes with a  <dig> × fold decrease were considered as significant. the expression levels of selected genes were confirmed by real time pcr analysis. calculations were performed with both the pm/mm  difference model and the pm  only model in order to compare the results.

in situ hybridization
in a first step we analyzed which of the differentially expressed genes had already previously been described in the literature to be expressed during preimplantation mouse development and therefore potentially play a role in maintenance of pluripotency. eight genes out of the  <dig> identified were considered as candidates to have a potential function in determination and maintenance of pluripotency in es cells. for these genes in situ hybridization was performed in order to define the regions of preimplantation embryos in which they were expressed. the temporo-spatial expression was analyzed by whole mount in situ hybridization of morulae and blastocysts. four genes, pramel <dig>  lefty <dig>  protein phosphatase  <dig> regulatory subunit 15b and hexokinase ii were expressed only in the central part of the morula and in the icm of the blastocyst . the other five genes, pramel <dig>  eif2s <dig>  pem/rhox <dig>  dppa <dig> and skp <dig> were found to be expressed in all cells of the morula and blastocysts . because the pramel <dig> expression was restricted to the central part of the morula and in the icm of the blastocyst, a more exact analysis of the preimplantation stages was performed . expression of pramel <dig> starts at the compacted morula stage, no expression could be detected in earlier developmental stages indicating that this gene fulfils the requirements for being a potential candidate involved in maintenance of pluripotency. a similar expression pattern can be observed for nanog  <cit> .

overexpression of pem/rhox <dig> and pramel <dig> is sufficient for maintenance of es cells in the absence of lif
in order to test if pramel <dig> is able to maintain pluripotency without direct activation of the stat <dig> cascade through lif the full-length cdna of pramel <dig> was inserted in the pfloxednanog vector  instead of the cdna of nanog, and the vector was electroporated in e <dig> es cells. in parallel the full-length cdna of pem/rhox <dig> was also cloned in the same way into the pfloxednanog vector. pem/rhox <dig> was previously described to play a role in maintenance of pluripotency, but it is not yet known if it is transcriptionally regulated through stat <dig>  as a control for the experiments the pfloxednanog vector itself was also electroporated in e <dig> cells. all electroporated cells were selected with puromycin and resistant colonies were picked and expanded. after testing for the presence of the vectors by pcr the positive clones were analyzed by real time pcr and the clones with the strongest expression were used for further experiments. in order to test for the capacity of maintaining pluripotency in absence of lif, the cells were cultivated for  <dig> days without addition of lif to the medium. after  <dig> days in culture ihc was performed in order to detect the expression of oct-3/ <dig>  ssea- <dig> and alkaline phosphatase . e <dig> wt es cells started after  <dig> days to differentiate and showed the typical flattened morphology of differentiating cells , after  <dig> days the cells were completely differentiated and no longer expressed oct-3/ <dig> and ssea- <dig>  nanog overexpressing cells as expected maintained their pluripotent state also in absence of lif. both pramel <dig> and pem/rhox <dig> overexpressing clones showed a similar behaviour as nanog overexpressing cells. the colonies maintained the typical round shaped morphology and expression of oct-3/ <dig> and ssea- <dig> was present indicating that these two genes were able to maintain pluripotency also in absence of lif.

discussion
es cell lines derived from different mouse strains exhibit variable degrees of lif dependency and to date it was unclear if higher amounts of stat <dig> in the inner cell mass of blastocyst could support the survival and derivation of pluripotent es cells in non-permissive mouse strains. our work indicates that the activation of the stat <dig> pathway during cultivation of blastocysts supports icm outgrowth and clearly favors the establishment of new es cell colonies in the so called non-permissive fvb mouse strain.

even though we were able to establish wt fvb/n es cells in the presence of lif these cells were not fully pluripotent and were unable to generate chimeras. only through the overexpression of stat3-mer cells we were able to establish germline competent fvb/n es cells. furthermore, in presence of oht both transgenic lines  <dig> and  <dig> generated es cell colonies with a very high efficiency. theoretically only 50% of the blastocysts were expected to be transgenic and this is also the establishment efficiency we obtained. it is therefore fair to assume that the establishment frequency was almost 100% .

interestingly no changes in the regulation of the classical marker for pluripotent es cells could be detected between wt and  <dig> cells. alkaline phosphatase, oct-3/ <dig>  ssea- <dig> were correctly expressed in both wildtype and transgenic es cell lines . rtq-pcr showed a slight upregulation of nanog in the  <dig> es cells . if this upregulation is due to a direct or an indirect interaction with stat <dig> has to be further analyzed. the different roles of the lif pathways and of nanog are yet not very clear. es cell populations are heterogeneous and it is also known that nanog is expressed discontinuously in pluripotent cells in the embryo and it is therefore to assume that nanog and the lif pathway interact to some extent in controlling the different events that regulate pluripotency and self-renewal. the recent findings of chambers et al.  corroborate this hypothesis. the authors demonstrated that nanog expression was specifically required for both the formation of the icm and of the germ cells, rather than for the housekeeping machinery of pluripotency embryonic, and that stem cells could self-renew indefinitely in the permanent absence of nanog  <cit> .

we were further interested in the identification of the molecular changes induced through stat3-mer overexpression. we therefore decided to identify stat3-pathway related genes by expression profiling. in general, there is great interest in identifying the signature of stemness by the constellation of genes that stem cells express. dna microarray technology allows the discovery of a large number of genes that are thought to be the molecular signature of mouse es cells. recently, global transcription profiles of undifferentiated es cells and blastocyst have been reported by several groups, most of these studies were comparing differentiated versus undifferentiated cells  <cit> . in our study the fvb/n wt cells and the fvb/n cells overexpressing stat3-mer are very similar, they just express different amounts of the transcription factor stat <dig> and therefore we assumed that they would differentially regulate only a few genes. we compared gene expression changes between fvb/n es cells overexpressing activated stat <dig> cultivated in the presence of oht and the absence of lif and wt fvb cells cultivated in the presence of lif by microarray analysis and identified a group of  <dig> genes that showed significant differential expression. from this list we preselected interesting genes by a careful literature and gene-expression databank analysis and identified which genes were characteristically expressed during the mouse preimplantation development.

these genes can be attributed to different categories according to their function: the first group contains regulatory members of the stat <dig> pathway that are involved in the regulation of downstream events of the jak/stat cascade , the second group of genes is involved in the regulation of es cell metabolism, whereas the third group contains genes that are involved in pluripotency maintenance and cell viability.

in the first group, among others, we found upregulation of socs- <dig> in stat3-mer overexpressing cells. socs <dig> is a member of the suppressor of cytokine signalling  family which has been implicated in the negative regulation of several pathways, in particular the jak/stat pathway, which can in turn induce socs expression and form a negative feedback circuit. the transcriptional upregulation of socs- <dig> confirms that the functional overexpression of stat3-mer induces the activation of the classical lif-dependent negative feedback mechanism . previously duval et al.  showed that expression of socs- <dig>  but not socs- <dig> and socs- <dig>  was stimulated in es cells in presence of lif. the author further demonstrated that, uncontrolled overexpression of socs- <dig> leads to repression of lif-dependent transcription and severely reduces cell viability. this suggests that the disturbance of a well-balanced socs protein content has adverse effects on cell survival  <cit> . since the fvb es cells overexpressing stat3-mer were viable and pluripotent, it is safe to assume that the socs- <dig> upregulation observed in presence of oht is a modulatory reaction due to the overproduction of stat <dig> in these cells. through this compensatory mechanism the cells are able to maintain a properly activated lif signalling cascade. it seems that the upregulation of socs- <dig> is a direct transcriptional activation mediated through stat <dig> because the promoters of both mouse and rat socs- <dig> genes contain putative stat1/stat <dig> binding elements, which are necessary and sufficient for lif-dependent activation of the socs- <dig> promoter activity in reporter assays  <cit> .

we also found protein phosphatase  <dig> regulatory subunit 15b  and the elongation initiation factor  <dig> subunit  <dig>  to be among the upregulated genes. pp1rs15b is a constitutively expressed inhibitory subunit of pp <dig>  one of the major eukaryotic serine/threonine phosphatases. pp1rs15b dephosphorylates the α-subunit of eif <dig>  <cit> . the microarray data confirm an upregulation of both pp1rs15b and eif2s <dig> indicating that these proteins may be involved in the control of the stat <dig> overexpression, whether these genes have a function in maintenance of pluripotency is still unclear.

in the second group we found hexokinase ii to be increased in cells overexpressing stat <dig>  this confirms the importance of this isozyme for embryo viability and indicates that a correct energetic balance is extremely important in the late stages of preimplantation and at the beginning of postimplantation in the embryos.

the third group of differentially expressed genes comprises molecules involved in the maintenance of pluripotency and cell viability. some of the identified genes were previously correlated with pluripotency  <cit>  or with embryo viability in somatic nuclei derived cloned blastocysts  <cit> .

lefty <dig> is regulated by pathways such as smad2/ <dig> and wnt and by oct-3/ <dig>  which support stemness. lefty is also induced upon exit from the state of stemness, including forced in vitro differentiation and lif withdrawal. when lif is withdrawn, the expression of lefty increases within  <dig> hours of cytokine withdrawal  <cit> . similarly, retinoic acid that induces differentiation leads to increased expression of lefty in mouse embryonic carcinoma cells  <cit> . differentiation of stem cells to embryoid bodies also leads to increased expression of lefty in vitro  <cit> . therefore, lefty might be important both to the stemness and differentiation events that follow the exit from this state.

murine pem/rhox <dig> is an x-linked homeobox-containing gene  <cit> , whose homeodomain shares important structural features with two other homeobox genes, which are expressed in extra embryonic lineages and during spermatogenesis  <cit> . the pem/rhox <dig> protein is expressed in the late morula stage, in te and icm of blastocyst and after implantation in extra embryonic tissues, in the parietal and visceral endoderm, but not in the primitive ectoderm derivatives. pem/rhox <dig> is also expressed in es cells, in primordial germ cells and in teratocarcinoma cell lines  <cit> . overexpression of pem/rhox <dig> had no phenotype in es cells, but completely inhibited differentiation into the three primary cell lineages, when es cells were cultured as embryoid bodies in suspension without lif  <cit> . two different models of action for pem/rhox <dig> are possible. fan et al.  suggested that pem/rhox <dig> first helps to maintain the undifferentiated cell state, and in a second step promotes a defined cell population of undifferentiated stem cells for differentiation into extra embryonic lineages  <cit> . sasaki et al  proposed an alternative in which pem/rhox <dig> directs early differentiation to specific lineages, but does maintain actively the undifferentiated state  <cit> . our data are in line with previous studies and indicate that pem/rhox <dig> plays an important role in maintaining pluripotency of es cells in absence of lif 

furthermore, overexpression of stat3-mer induced differential expression of four genes  that were identified as a set of oct-3/ <dig> related genes that were not correctly reactivated in somatic nuclei derived cloned embryos and therefore represent genes that are necessary for embryo viability  <cit> . dppa <dig>  is preferentially expressed in primordial germ cells, oocytes and preimplantation embryos. in blastocysts, dppa <dig> is expressed in te and icm and in the early postimplantation embryos dppa <dig> expression disappears. the expression re-emerges when at day e <dig>  the first primordial germ cells  appear  <cit> . dppa <dig> knockout mice are compromised in development; some embryos develop to the two or four cell stage, but fail to reach 8-cell stage  <cit> . dppa <dig> was proposed by sato et al. to play a role in germ line specification in mice by preventing nascent germ cell populations from a somatic cell fate and by retaining their pluripotency  <cit> . the embryonic function of ndp52l <dig>  is to date unclear but it is capable of forming dimers and contains leucine zipper motifs indicating a possible function in splicing processes  <cit> .

pramel <dig> and pramel <dig>  are prevalently expressed in preimplantation embryos and embryonic pluripotent cells  <cit> . our results confirm these expression patterns and clearly show that whereas pramel <dig> is typically expressed in all cells of the morula and blastocyst, pramel <dig> is expressed only in the inner part of the morula and in the icm of the blastocyst. the function of the pramel genes in embryonic development is unknown, but interestingly, prame inhibits retinoic-acid induced differentiation in mouse embryonic carcinoma f <dig> cells  <cit> . recently kaji et al  showed that pramel <dig> and pramel <dig> expression is mediated by mbd <dig>  a component of the nucleosome remodelling and histone deacetylation  complex  <cit> . kaji et al. proposed that the mbd3/nurd-mediated silencing of pramel <dig> and pramel <dig> in es cells offers an epigenetic environment in which mbd3/nurd is not absolutely required but facilitates differentiation. furthermore the authors describe that mbd <dig> deficiency leads to down regulation of dppa <dig> in es cells. taken altogether, expression pattern analysis suggests that dppa <dig>  pramel <dig> and pramel <dig> are collaborating in deciding the fate of es cells.

we were further interested in clarifying if some of the identified stat3-pathway related genes could individually maintaining pluripotency in es cells. pem/rhox <dig> and pramel <dig> were chosen for this experiments: pramel <dig> because of its characteristic expression pattern in the central part of the morula and in the inner cell mass of the blastocyst, an expression pattern which is very similar to the one observed for nanog  <cit>  and is typical for a gene involved in maintenance of pluripotency. pem/rhox <dig> because it was previously described in the literature as a gene blocking the differentiation capacity of the icm and of es cells  <cit> . overexpression of pramel <dig> and pem/rhox <dig> in es cells and cultivation in absence of lif, allowed the maintenance of pluripotency, as shown by ihc with the typical pluripotency related markers oct-3/ <dig> and ssea- <dig> and with alkaline phosphatase staining, indicating the importance of these proteins in maintaining es cells in a pluripotent state .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary the data presented here indicates that the overexpression of functional stat3-mer in fvb/n blastocysts sustains and facilitates the establishment of germline competent es cells in absence of lif. our findings open up the possibility of establishing germline competent es cells from non-permissive mouse strains by manipulation of the stat <dig> signal transduction pathway. furthermore, gene expression analysis of these transgenic cells cultivated in presence of oht showed that  <dig> genes were differentially expressed compared to wt cells cultivated in presence of lif. by in situ hybridization analysis it was possible to identify four up-regulated genes  whose expression was restricted to the icm of the blastocysts. overexpression of two of the upregulated genes, pem/rhox <dig> and pramel <dig>  in e <dig> cells and cultivation in absence of lif demonstrated that these two genes are able to maintain the embryonic stem cells in a pluripotent state without addition of lif to the culture media.
