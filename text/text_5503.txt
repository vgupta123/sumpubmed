BACKGROUND
alteration of the host’s metabolism is common in infectious diseases; it can lead to patient malnutrition and the need for nutritional support  <cit> . infection-driven metabolic changes are characterized by an accelerated flux of glucose, lipids, proteins and amino acids that may result in net protein loss and diabetic-like hyperglycemia  <cit> . significant metabolic disorders have been observed in natural and experimental infections with the bacterium salmonella enterica, including changes of the lipid and protein profiles and widespread hormonal imbalances  <cit> . in humans, salmonella enterica serovar typhi causes typhoid fever, a disease characterized by multi-organ bacterial colonization with common immunopathological manifestations in the gastrointestinal tract and the hepatobiliary system  <cit> .

the molecular and physiological bases of the metabolic disorders observed during infection are not fully understood. in this work, we examined the disruption of the enterohepatic fibroblast growth factor 15/ <dig> -fibroblast growth factor receptor  <dig>  endocrine axis during bacterial infections of the enterohepatic system. fgf15/ <dig>  is an endocrine factor secreted by intestinal enterocytes  <cit> . fgf15/ <dig> has a crucial role in the control of whole body glucose and lipid metabolism and energy expenditure  <cit> . it is also a key regulator of de novo synthesis of bile acids via the repression of cholesterol  <dig> alpha hydroxylase  expression in hepatocytes  <cit> . in addition, fgf <dig> represses the apical na+-dependent bile acid transporter  expression in hepatic cholangiocytes  <cit>  and facilitates gallbladder filling by promoting gallbladder muscle distension  <cit> . through these functions, fgf15/ <dig> closes an important negative feedback loop in the regulation of bile acid homeostasis. signaling to hepatic target cells occurs through the interaction of fgf15/ <dig> with the tyrosine kinase receptor fibroblast growth factor receptor  <dig>  and also requires the protein βklotho. mice genetically deficient for fgf <dig>  fgfr <dig> or klb  have similar biliary phenotypes with higher levels of cyp7a <dig> and increased synthesis of bile acids  <cit> . reduced fgf <dig> levels have been observed in patients with inflammatory bowel disease  <cit>  and chronic idiopathic bile acid diarrhea  <cit> . on the other hand, patients with insulin resistance and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, as well as extrahepatic cholestasis frequently display elevated plasma levels of fgf <dig>  <cit> .

using a model of murine typhoid fever, we demonstrate that salmonella enterica infection triggers major alterations in the hepatic biliary function gene expression program, promotes accumulation of hepatic cholesterol and triglycerides and leads to a significant reduction in physiological gallbladder bile volumes. in addition, salmonella infection causes a substantial decrease in the expression of intestinal fgf <dig>  accompanied by a dramatic loss of hepatic fgfr <dig> and βklotho. these disturbances appear to be secondary to hepatic inflammation. given the important role of the fgf15/19-fgfr <dig> endocrine axis as a central metabolic regulator, these alterations may be a major factor underlying the pathophysiology of bacterial infectious diseases.

methods
bacterial strains and mouse infections
salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium strains sl <dig>  and sb <dig>   <cit>  and listeria monocytogenes 10403 s   <cit>  were used in this study. bacteria were grown overnight at 37°c in lb supplemented with 100 μg/ml streptomycin. inoculum was prepared in sterile hepes 100 mm, nacl  <dig> %, ph  <dig> . animal protocols were approved by the animal care committees of the university of british columbia and the university of sherbrooke. eight weeks-old female c57bl/ <dig> mice  were infected orally with 5 × 107salmonella sl <dig>  intravenously with 5 × 102salmonella sb <dig> or with listeria 10403 s . the animals were kept with food and water ad libitum through the duration of the study and were always sacrificed during the light period . the bile was collected by gallbladder resection and draining by puncture. for bacterial counts, tissues were homogenized using a mixer mill mm <dig>  followed by plating of serial dilutions in lb plates containing 100 μg/ml streptomycin. all infection experiments were done in duplicate using a total of 8– <dig> mice per group.

expression analyses
ileum and liver samples were collected for mrna and protein analysis. the ileal samples were taken approximately 2 cm away from the ileo-cecal junction; liver samples were taken from the central lobule. rna was extracted using the rneasy kit  and cdna was prepared using the quantitech reverse transcription kit . quantitative pcr  were done on an eppendorf realplex <dig> system using the dynamo sybr green qpcr kit . all reactions were done in 10 μl final volume with 40 cycles of 30 seconds denaturing at 95°c, 30 seconds annealing at 60°c and 30 seconds extension at 72°c . the relative expressions were calculated using the ddct method and corrected for primer efficiencies according to pfaffl et. al. <cit> . the qpcr primers are listed in table  <dig>  western blots were performed using total liver tissue lysates and antibodies against cyp7a <dig> , fgfr <dig> , βklotho  and actin .

the top sequence of each set corresponds to the forward primer and the bottom one to the reverse. all reactions were done in 10 μl final volume with 40 cycles of 30 seconds denaturing at 95°c, 30 seconds annealing at 60°c and 30 seconds extension at 72°c .

microscopy
for histological analysis, tissue sections were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin and stained with h&e. alternatively, samples fixed in  <dig> % paraformaldehyde and frozen-embedded in oct were used for immunofluorescent microscopy as previously described  <cit> . fluorescence was visualized using an olympus ix <dig> microscope.

cholesterol and triglyceride determinations
cholesterol and triglycerides were assayed in liver lysates. a total of 40-100 mg of liver was homogenized with an ultra turrax  in 3 ml of chloroform:methanol , extracted twice with water, and centrifuged for 15 minutes at 3000 g. for the triglyceride assay 200 μl of the organic layer  was removed and evaporated under n <dig>  10 μl of thesit  was added and mixed under n <dig>  water  was added and incubated at 37°c for 1 hr with intermittent vortexing. aliquots of 5 μl were assayed using the serum triglyceride determination kit  modified for a 96-well plate, calibrated with a trioleate  standard curve. the cholesterol assay was performed at the same time but 500 μl of the organic layer  was removed after the centrifugation step and evaporated under n <dig>  50 μl of isopropanol was then added to the dried down lipids and mixed by vortexing. aliquots of 2 μl were then assayed using the cholesterol e kit .

statistical analyses
data processing and statistical analyses were performed using graphpad prism <dig>  student’s t test was applied to all sets of data for statistical comparisons between groups, the graphs show the means and the standard errors of the mean.

RESULTS
enterohepatic infections downregulate the expression of intestinal fgf15
the terminal ileum is the main site of production of fgf <dig>  it is also a major port of entry for salmonella and therefore, an important site for its pathogenesis. to determine the effect of salmonella infection on the homeostatic synthesis of fgf <dig>  we collected tissue samples from infected animals and analyzed the abundance of fgf <dig> transcripts by qpcr. as shown in figures 1a and 1b, the level of fgf <dig> transcripts inversely correlated with bacterial counts in the liver and the ileum, with a statistically significant decrease observed at mid-high infection levels. while h&e-stained sections from the ileum of infected animals did not show signs of pathological alteration , staining of liver sections demonstrated a strong inflammatory response evidenced by large lesions with widespread lymphocytic infiltration, extensive necrosis often accompanied by local hemorrhage, and zones of parenchymal degeneration characterized by disappearance of hepatocytes .

fgf <dig> is synthesized by enterocytes  <cit> , which can also be invaded by salmonella <cit> . however, the decrease in fgf <dig> expression was not associated with damage to the ileal enterocyte layer . this suggests that loss of ileal enterocytes is not the reason for reduced fgf <dig> transcript levels. oral infections with listeria monocytogenes, an inefficient invader of the mouse intestinal epithelium  <cit> , showed no significant liver colonization and large numbers of intestinal bacteria but not downregulation of fgf <dig> expression . in contrast, intravenous infections with listeria, which colonized the liver rapidly and triggered deccreases in the transcript levels of biliary function genes , caused a significant reduction in ileal fgf <dig> expression . these results point to hepatic pathophysiology, rather than intestinal bacterial colonization, as the primary event driving downregulation of intestinal fgf <dig> expression.

to establish the role of hepatic colonization and to probe the involvement of bacterial enterocyte invasion in repressing fgf <dig> expression, we carried out intravenous infections with the salmonella invasion-deficient strain sb <dig> following menendez et al. <cit> . in this type of infection, salmonella colonization of the hepatobiliary system occurs immediately whereas colonization of the gut is delayed by  <dig> to 96 hours  <cit> . furthermore, the bacteria that eventually reach the intestines are unable to invade the enterocytes due to the inva mutation of this strain. as shown in figure 2c, intravenous infection with salmonella sb <dig> caused a reduction of fgf <dig> transcripts abundance. notably, such a decrease was observed with a much lower intestinal bacterial burden than those in oral infections with the wild-type strain . these results demonstrate that colonization of the hepatobiliary system by salmonella represses the expression of intestinal fgf <dig> and show that enterocyte invasion by intestinal bacteria does not play a major role on this effect.

transcription of fgf <dig> in ileal enterocytes is trans-activated by the nuclear receptor fxr , upon its activation by bile acids  <cit> . expression of the fxr gene  was not affected by salmonella, regardless of the intestinal bacterial burden . in contrast, the expression of other known intestinal fxr target genes, fabp <dig> , nr0b <dig>   <cit>  and osta   <cit> , was decreased by salmonella infection in a pattern similar to that of fgf <dig> with maximal, significant drops in highly-infected animals . this suggests that activation of gene expression mediated by fxr is impaired during infection.

colonization of the hepatobiliary system by salmonella induces local pathological damage and inflammation  <cit> , which can result in impaired synthesis of bile acids and inflammation-induced cholestasis  <cit> . this may in turn, compromise intestinal fxr activation and lead to inhibition of fgf <dig>  fabp <dig>  nr0b <dig> and osta expression. to test whether the depletion of bile acids would be sufficient to decrease fgf <dig> expression in vivo, we fed uninfected c57bl/ <dig> mice with a diet supplemented with the bile acid sequestrant cholestyramine. as shown in figure 3b mice fed with cholestyramine did have significantly lower levels of fgf <dig> transcripts than mice fed with a normal diet.

second, we evaluated the effects of salmonella infection in bile production and flow. gallbladder bile volumes were measured before and during infection; a significant reduction in volume was observed 24 hours post-infection, which did not improved over the next 4 days . an expression analysis of hepatic genes involved in bile synthesis and secretion , showed striking reductions in the transcript levels of the major transporters of bile acid and cholesterol  and the induction of several genes involved in rescue from cholestasis. the mrna  and protein levels  of cyp7a <dig>  the rate-limiting enzyme in the neutral pathway of bile acids synthesis, were decreased by infection. this was accompanied by a significant accumulation of hepatic cholesterol and triglycerides , which collectively suggest interruption of bile synthesis and flow.

salmonella infection leads to depletion of the hepatic fgf <dig> receptor complex
signaling of fgf <dig> in hepatocytes requires the tyrosine kinase membrane receptor fgfr <dig> and the protein βklotho. to determine if salmonella infection disturbs the homeostasis of this pathway, we analyzed the levels of fgfr <dig> and βklotho in infected and uninfected livers. figures 6a and 6b show that the transcript levels of both fgfr <dig> and klb  were significantly decreased by infection. in addition, the protein levels were also reduced, as evidenced by western blot . two major fgfr <dig> bands were detected in uninfected animals, with apparent molecular weights of  <dig> and  <dig> kda, likely corresponding to the core-glycosylated  and fully-glycosylated, functional  forms of fgfr <dig>  respectively  <cit> . infection led to the disappearance of fgfr <dig> and a decrease of fgfr <dig>  immunofluorescent staining of liver sections confirmed the reduction of fgfr <dig> and βklotho. both proteins were clearly detected in uninfected hepatocytes ; in contrast, hepatocytes from salmonella-infected livers were devoid of fgfr <dig> and βklotho.

discussion
the fgf19-fgfr <dig> endocrine axis is currently considered a potential intervention point for the therapy of cancer, gallstone disease, and metabolic disorders associated to the metabolic syndrome  <cit> . experimental administrations of fgf <dig> and transgenic fgf <dig> mice have shown decreased liver fat content, improved hepatic and serum lipid profiles, and resistance to high-fat diet-induced obesity  <cit> . in addition, fgf15/ <dig> induces hepatocyte proliferation  <cit>  and has been recently identified as an important mediator of liver regeneration after liver resection surgery  <cit> . here we show that salmonella infection disturbs the homeostasis of the fgf15/19-fgfr <dig> axis by down-regulating the expression of fgf <dig>  fgfr <dig> and klb. to our knowledge, these results constitute the first demonstration of a pathophysiological effect of bacterial infections over the fgf15/19-fgfr <dig> endocrine axis.

infection modified both the ileal expression of fgf <dig> and the components of its hepatic receptor, which suggests a significant functional shutdown of the pathway. our data rules out a direct cytopathic effect of bacteria over ileal enterocytes as the major cause of fgf <dig> mrna reductions. instead, it is apparent that the decline in fgf <dig> expression results from impaired activation of fxr in the enterocytes. our interpretation is strongly supported by the observed low volumes of gallbladder bile and the decreased expression of fabp <dig>  ostα and nr0b <dig> , all well-known fxr targets. in addition, we show that the depletion of the intestinal bile acids pool by oral administration of the bile acid sequestrant cholestyramine is sufficient to significantly decrease ileal fgf <dig> expression. furthermore, intravenous infections with a salmonella invasion mutant and with listeria monocytogenes, both resulting in rapid hepatic colonization and pathophysiology, lead to reductions in fgf <dig> expression in the absence of significant ileal bacterial colonization or enterocyte invasion.

salmonella infection induced a massive alteration of the hepatobiliary gene expression program. remarkably, the mrna and protein levels of cyp7a <dig>  the rate-limiting enzyme in the neutral pathway of bile acids synthesis were decreased during infection, in spite of the lower levels of fgf <dig> which would be expected to promote the upregulation of cyp7a <dig> expression. these results reveal the complexities in the regulation of cyp7a <dig> expression and indicates that the mechanisms of cyp7a <dig> expression control are hierarchical. infection also triggered a significant reduction of fgfr <dig> and βklotho, the two proteins involved in assembling the functional receptor for fgf <dig> in hepatocytes. the biology of fgfr <dig> and βklotho had never before been studied in the context of a bacterial insult, and our data suggest that their function can be severely compromised by bacterial infections in vivo. the mechanisms underlying their downregulation are unclear at present but we anticipate that they are related to the pro-inflammatory cytokine burst that follows liver colonization by bacteria. it has been recently reported that tnfα represses βklotho expression in adipocytes  <cit> ; thus it is possible that a similar mechanism acts in hepatocytes.

it is apparent that the dysregulation of the fgf15/19-fgfr <dig> endocrine axis components is not a general pathogenic feature of all bacteria, as infections with the enteric pathogen citrobacter rodentium, the mouse model for human epec and ehec  <cit> , did not modify the expression of ileal fgf <dig> . instead, this pathophysiological effect may be restricted to infections displaying a relevant liver involvement. further work is still necessary to define the full impact of infections in fgf15/ <dig> function and to determine the underlying molecular mechanisms.

CONCLUSIONS
through the alteration of the hepatobiliary function, bacterial pathogens of the enterohepatic system dysregulate the homeostasis of the fgf15/19-fgfr <dig> endocrine axis. these revealing findings have important implications for the understanding of the pathophysiology of microbial diseases. disruption of the fgf15/19-fgfr <dig> pathway may be a contributing factor to the metabolic and nutritional disorders associated with infectious diseases.
