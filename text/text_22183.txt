BACKGROUND
approximately  <dig>  women are diagnosed with cervical cancer worldwide each year and more than half of them will die from this disease  <cit> . the highest incidence rates are observed in developing countries where it is the second most prevalent cancer in women and remains a leading cause of cancer related death  <cit> . widely implemented screening programs have been responsible for the much lower incidence and mortality rates seen in the developed world. present day screening methods primarily identify precancer lesions termed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia . cin lesions are classified into three subgroups, cin i, cin ii and cin iii, corresponding to mild, moderate and severe dysplasia/carcinoma in situ , respectively. cin iii lesions have a high likelihood of progression to invasive disease if left untreated  <cit> . human papillomavirus  has long been established as a necessary but not sufficient cause for cervical carcinoma development. hpv is detected in 99% of invasive disease, 94% of cin lesions and 46% of normal cervical epithelium  <cit> . the high risk strains hpv  <dig> and hpv  <dig> are most prevalent in invasive disease.

a comprehensive characterization of gene expression of the normal cervical tissue is critical to establish a baseline for comparison against transcriptomes of precancer and cancer. a recent report described the global expression of genes in cervical epithelium using a serial analysis of gene expression  based method, enumerating  <dig>  sequence tags generated from one normal uterine ectocervical tissue  <cit> . another study compared cdna microarray profiles of cervical tissue to exfoliated cervical cells used in cytology-based cancer screening  <cit> .

in this study, we increased the depth of our understanding of the normal cervical transcriptome and identified gene expression changes in ciniii. we achieved this  by using an unbiased long sage  approach to improve the accuracy of tag-to-gene mapping  <cit> , and  by examining  <dig>  l-sage tags thus increasing publicly available cervical sage data by greater than  <dig> fold.

RESULTS
in this study, we sequenced  <dig>  sage tags from four libraries. cervical l-sage libraries n <dig>  n <dig>  c <dig>  and c <dig> were sequenced to  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  tags, respectively. duplicate ditags were eliminated from analysis resulting in  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  useful tags respectively and a total of  <dig>   <dig> unique tags .  <dig>  of the unique tags mapped to annotated unigene identifiers. the raw data of the sequence tags have been made publicly available . we characterized the transcriptome of normal cervical tissue and evaluated the highly expressed genes in terms of tissue specificity, concordant expression among the normal libraries and their altered expression in cin iii lesions .

genes highly expressed in normal cervical epithelium
 <dig> unique tags were found to be highly expressed in the normal cervical epithelium .  <dig> of these tags mapped to unigene clusters and represent  <dig> unique genes and hypothetical proteins . manual examination of tags not mapped by sage genie yielded three additional tags. this results in a total of  <dig> unique tag-to-gene mappings and  <dig> unique genes. the abundance of the  <dig> tags and the genes they represent are summarized in table  <dig> 

to determine cervical tissue specific expression, we first investigated the expression of the  <dig> genes using expression data available at the national center for biotechnology information  unigene database and the national cancer institute  cancer genome anatomy project  sage anatomical viewer. based on cgap information, only four of the  <dig> genes were unique to cervical tissue: carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule  <dig> , keratin 6a , small proline-rich protein  <dig>  and s <dig> calcium binding protein a <dig> . these genes were further investigated for expression by rt-pcr in  <dig> different tissue types and three normal cervical specimens . ceacam <dig> was found to be expressed in colon, larynx, pancreas and two of the three normal cervical specimens. krt6a expression was detected in placenta, thymus, tongue, prostate, larynx, colon, skin and in all three of the normal cervical specimens. sprr <dig> was found strongly expressed in placenta, thymus, colon, tongue, larynx and all three of the normal cervical cases. s100a <dig> showed expression in placenta, thymus, and tongue and in all three of the normal cervical specimens. all four genes were prominently expressed in the cervical epithelium but this combination of genes was not expressed in the tissues examined .

disrupted gene expression in cin iii
all tags were assessed for altered expression in cin iii. four hundred and seventy-six tag show greater than two fold increase in cin iii and are expressed at greater than  <dig> tpm  while  <dig> tags were decreased in cin iii .

we determined if the expression of the  <dig> unique tags, that were highly expressed in normal cervical libraries , were disrupted in cin iii. comparison of expression levels in n <dig>  n <dig> to the cin iii libraries using the z-test revealed five differentially expressed genes . annexin  <dig> , galectin  <dig>  and connexin  <dig>  exhibited decreased expression in cin iii  while aquaporin  <dig>  and ribosomal-like protein  <dig>  increased in expression . real-time pcr was performed on a panel of  <dig> new cervical specimens, three each of normal and cin iii for all five of these genes . expression results were normalized to housekeeping gene actb and 18s . decrease in expression of anxa <dig>  lgals <dig> and gja <dig> in cin iii was confirmed while increase in expression of aqp <dig> and rpl <dig> were not.

a z >  <dig> ; reduced expression in cin iii, z < - <dig> ; increased expression in cin iii.

viral  tags in l-sage libraries
hpv transcripts were also detected by l-sage. tags from all four libraries were mapped against the genomes of hpv  <dig> and hpv  <dig>  while no tags mapped to hpv  <dig>  twelve tags from the cin iii libraries mapped to the more prevalent hpv  <dig> genome . the highest transcript counts of known genes belonged to e <dig> at  <dig>  and  <dig> tpm and e <dig> at  <dig> and  <dig> tpm, in libraries c <dig> and c <dig>  respectively. compared by blast  <cit>  against the refseq genome collection, none of the twelve tags matched 100% to the human genome. all twelve tags were also mapped against human transcript sets . no tags matched to any of the described transcript sets with the exception of catgcacgctttttaattaca and catgtgtatgtattaaaaata which mapped to human est bf <dig>  the full length est sequence is 97% identical with the hpv  <dig> e <dig> gene and was likely amplified from hpv sequences in the originating uterine tumour lesion.

discussion
this study represents the most comprehensive gene expression analysis of cervical tissue reported to date. in total,  <dig>  l-sage tags were sequenced . the length of the l-sage tags  greatly reduces tag-to-gene mapping ambiguity  <cit> .  <dig> of the  <dig>  highly expressed tags  were mapped to known genes or hypothetical proteins encompassing  <dig> unique genes .

assessing highly expressed tags by functional group
of the  <dig> highly expressed tags ,  <dig> were expressed at extremely high levels  including genes frequently used as controls in expression analysis, gapdh and actb. high expression of  <dig> genes in normal cervical tissue was reported in a previous study  <cit> . fifteen of these genes are encompassed by our list of  <dig> high expressers. the most highly expressed tags expressed at > <dig> tpm  mapped to the genes s100a <dig> and s100a <dig>  respectively. both genes belong to the calcium binding protein family. these findings are in agreement with a previous report of high s100a <dig> and s100a <dig> levels in cervical tissue  <cit> . although the function of these genes is not well understood, genes within this family have been proposed to participate in a variety of cellular process including cell cycle, wound healing and cell differentiation  <cit> .

assigning the  <dig> highly expressed genes to one of eleven broad functional groups allowed for an assessment of those cellular processes represented by the most abundant transcripts. these cellular processes include calcium binding proteins, cell cycle or cell death, cytoskeleton, immune functioning, keratinization, membrane proteins, mitochondrial, protein processing, translation , translation  with a small fraction of tags mapping to other functional groups or to genes with no known function . the  <dig> ribosomal genes account for the greatest proportion of highly expressed genes at 28% and 31% . in contrast, only five calcium binding genes account for the second largest functional subgroup of highly expressed tags, 18% and 19% .

the relative expression levels of the functional groups do not change greatly between the normal and cin iii libraries however the keratin and immune related functional groups show slight decrease from 12% and 17% in cin iii to 9% and 14% in normal tissue .

all tags expressed at or greater than  <dig> tpm in normal and cin iii libraries  were also evaluated according functional group using onto-express   <cit> . the most represented groups included dna dependent transcription regulators and transcription in both the normal and cin iii libraries.

cervical tissue gene signature
four of the  <dig> unique genes we found to be abundantly expressed in normal cervical tissue were documented to have limited or no expression in other tissues according to the web resources ncbi unigene  <cit>  and nci cgap sage anatomical viewer  <cit>  . these genes  are our candidates for an expression signature unique to normal cervical tissue and were further investigated in a panel of  <dig> different tissue types and three new normal cervical specimens. we found that all four of these genes were not abundantly expressed simultaneously in any of the  <dig> tissues examined . placenta, thymus and tongue were found to express a combination of three genes , while colon expressed another combination . krt6a and sprr <dig> expression was observed in larynx tissue with only minimal expression detected for s100a <dig> and ceacam <dig>  in contrast, two of the cervical cases strongly expressed all four genes investigated while only the third showed very low ceacam <dig> expression. significantly, our study is the first to document ceacam <dig> expression in cervix. the data suggest that abundant expression of ceacam <dig> and s100a <dig> collectively, are unique to cervical tissue and have the potential to serve as useful biomarkers in identifying origins of metastatic disease.

it is interesting to note that decreased expression of three of the genes is linked to abnormal growth and organization of epithelium. for example, ceacam <dig> is a member of the carcinoembryonic antigen family of genes and expression has been documented in highly differentiated normal colon epithelium and the apical surface of normal ductal pancreas epithelium, while loss of expression has been reported in colon hyperplastic polyps  <cit> . another member of this gene family, ceacam <dig>  is shown to have no or very low expression in cervical carcinoma  <cit> . decreased expression of krt6a and s100a <dig> have been associated with breast, lung and ovarian cancer  <cit> . sprr <dig> belongs to the class of small proline rich genes which are expressed in differentiated keratinocytes and has previously been shown to be highly expressed in normal cervical tissue  <cit> .

genes altered in expression in cin iii
the  <dig> highly expressed unique tags in the normal libraries were assessed for expression changes in cin iii. two genes showed increased expression  while three genes declined in transcript counts in the cin iii libraries . all five were evaluated by real-time pcr in a new cervical tissue panel. results for anxa <dig>  lgals <dig> and gja <dig> confirmed l-sage findings.

panel results for gja <dig> are in agreement with those reported by king et al. in that gja <dig> expression was detected in normal cervical epithelium while reduced expression was observed in cin iii lesions investigated  <cit> . it has been suggested that this pattern may be a consequence of epithelial disorganization and not causative in dysplasia development  <cit> .

the high expression of lgals <dig> in normal cervical epithelium contrasted by the low expression seen in the cin iii lesions in the tissue panel we report here is similar to those expression patterns seen in studies of other normal tissue types compared to their respective carcinomas including cornea and larynx  <cit> . lgals <dig> expression has been hypothesized in all stratified epithelium tissue types and has been experimentally detected in human cornea, heart, larynx, tongue, skin, thymus and thyroid  <cit> . though, lgals <dig> has been investigated in the context of cell line models, it is interesting to note that expression of this gene in cervical epithelium has not been previously reported  <cit> . lgals <dig> is one of fifteen members of the b-galactoside-binding lectin family, some of which have been shown to influence cell growth, cell cycle, apoptosis and cell migration via their predicted role in homeostasis, however, the role of lgals <dig> in cancer is unclear  <cit> . support for the pro-apoptotic function of lgals <dig> was reported by kuwabara et al. and bernard et al. who identified cells more sensitive to apoptosis when lgals <dig> expression was high in the epithelium derived cells  <cit> . in contrast, demers et al. showed an increase in lgals <dig> expression in lymphoma cells and suggested a positive role in cell growth and dispersal through induced matrix metalloproteinase  <dig>  expression  <cit> . we did not observe a statistically significant change in mmp <dig> in the four libraries investigated. this variance in expression suggests multiple roles for lgals <dig> that may be tissue-type dependent.

the third gene investigated, anxa <dig>  is known to be highly expressed in epithelial cells and is localized to the plasma membrane and endosome. it has been suggested to function in linking membrane to membrane and membrane to cytoskeleton  <cit> . the decrease in expression we observe suggests that the loss of anxa <dig> may be a causative factor in disorganisation of the epithelial architecture, which is characteristic of cervical neoplastic lesions. anxa <dig> is also known to bind with s100a <dig> and participates in transport channel function across the plasma membrane  <cit> . interestingly, the anxa <dig> binding site on s100a <dig> also binds ns <dig>  a viral protein from the bluetongue virus, and therefore directly competes with anxa <dig>  the s100a <dig> protein has also been shown inhibit hepatitis b virus polymerase  activity  <cit> . it is plausible that a s100a10-anxa <dig> complex may have a role in hpv infection or viral lifecycle. s100a <dig> expression was high and consistent in normal and cin iii libraries whereas anxa <dig> decreased in the cin iii libraries.

the above real-time pcr results were normalized to the widely accepted housekeeping gene actb . for comparison we also normalized the genes to a second housekeeping gene 18s . briefly, results for gja <dig> and lgals <dig> were in agreement to those when normalizing to actb, however anxa <dig> was shown to be increased in cin iii as expected by the sage data. but this does not concur with the qpcr results when normalized to actb. one possible explanation is that on average, the actb cycle threshold was > <dig>  ct lower in the cin iii cases indicating an increase in actb expression in cin iii lesions. any ct decrease less than this in the genes investigated would appear as a decrease in gene expression in cin iii when normalized to actb but and increase when normalized to 18s.

the real-time pcr results for aqp <dig> and rpl <dig> did not concur with l-sage data and may be due to interindividual differences rather than a representation of changes present in cin lesions or cancer. it is interesting to note that rpl <dig> overexpression in prostate cancer, colon cancer cell lines and clinical specimens have been reported  <cit> . our l-sage results also suggest a similar pattern in cervical neoplasia. results for these genes when normalized to 18s showed an increase in expression in only cin iii a .

wong et al investigated gene expression in invasive cervical carcinoma by dna microarray  <cit> . we investigated this publicly available data through ncbi geo  <cit> . briefly, in this data, gja <dig> showed a small decrease in expression in invasive disease while lgals <dig> was detected in only four of the  <dig> specimens, three of which were normal tissue. moderate aqp <dig> expression was detected in the majority of cases including the control group. expression of anxa <dig> and rpl <dig> was not assessed in the microarray study.

human l-sage tags map to the hpv genome
hpv is an established etiological factor in cervical cancer  <cit> . there are over  <dig> known strains of hpv, however hpv  <dig> and hpv  <dig> are considered to be the frequent high risk types owing to higher rates of persistent infection, higher rates of progression to cervical neoplasia, and shorter median progression times than other hpv strains  <cit> . hpv  <dig> is the most common strain and can be detected in approximately 60% of cervical cancers, while hpv  <dig> infection occurs in approximately 10–20%. uncontrolled expression of e <dig> and e <dig> genes from strains  <dig> or  <dig> are considered to be essential for oncogenic transformation and function through inhibition of host cell tumour suppressors p <dig> and the retinoblastoma protein   <cit> .

this is the first study to mine human sage libraries for viral transcripts. overall, cin iii library c <dig>  possessed a greater number of tag counts from the more prevalent hpv  <dig> strain when compared to c <dig>  . hpv  <dig> tags were not found in any library and no viral tags were detected in the normal libraries. with the exception of two tags, the viral tags expressed in cervical sage did not map to known human genes or expressed sequences. the exceptions, catgcacgctttttaattaca and catgtgtatgtattaaaaata, mapped to a single human est isolated from a uterine tumour . the full length est sequence is 97% identical with the hpv  <dig> genome, more specifically the e <dig> gene, and therefore was likely amplified from hpv sequences in the original lesion.

tags mapping to the e <dig> gene accounted for the greatest proportion of hpv tags mapping to known transcripts in both c <dig> and c <dig> . e <dig> is considered to be one of three hpv  <dig> oncogenes  and is highly expressed in basal cells of premalignant cervical lesions  <cit> . this expression declines as cells differentiate and move toward the apical face of the epithelium whereas e <dig> and e <dig> expression increases  <cit> . e <dig> is detected throughout all epithelium layers in high grade lesions such as cin iii. in contrast, expression is restricted to layers closest to the basal cells in low grade lesions, implying that e <dig> expression may be limited to undifferentiated basal cells  <cit> . the high expression of e <dig> we observe in the cin iii libraries and the absence of hpv  <dig> genes in the normal libraries is in concordance with such studies.

an increase in sample size and inclusion of mild and moderate stages of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia will aid in quantifying the relationship between viral gene expression and disease. this will also assist in further elucidating genes important in early lesion transcriptome events. a comparison of such events with those seen in later stages will help to identify genes important in the molecular pathogenesis of the disease.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we have described the transcriptome of normal cervical tissues and compared against that of cin iii lesions. this was achieved by construction of four l-sage libraries and sequencing to the depth of  <dig>  tags per library on average. we highlighted that the long-sage technique provides a comprehensive profile of the transcriptome without focusing on only known genes. potent tumour suppressors , cell cycle mediators , and cellular respiration genes  were found to be tightly regulated in the normal libraries. an expression signature of four highly expressed genes  in normal cervical epithelium was identified and confirmed, and three abundantly expressed genes  were found to have altered expression in cin iii. furthermore, this is the first study to have identified viral tags in human sage libraries demonstrating the versatile nature of sage data, which allows for mining and re-mining according to newly posed questions. hpv  <dig> e <dig> transcripts were found most highly expressed while few e <dig> and no e <dig> transcripts were enumerated.

the identification of expression changes associated with stages of disease progression will help further our understanding of cervical cancer development and potentially elucidate novel targets for diagnosis and treatment. establishing a baseline from which to compare is essential to the identification of such aberrations and the  <dig> fold increase in cervical gene expression data presented here is a significant contribution to this effort.
