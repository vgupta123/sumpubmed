BACKGROUND
genome duplication has been proposed as an advantageous path to evolutionary innovation and functional divergence  <cit> . ohno's theory hypothesizes that duplicates are mostly silenced by degenerative mutations following duplication due to a redundancy in function. although probabilities of duplicates acquiring novel and beneficial functions is lower than duplicates being silenced  <cit> , the classical model of the fates of duplicate genes proposed by ohno is coming under increasing scrutiny  <cit> . preservation of duplicate genes is believed to be a common fate, particularly for genes that contain multiple regulatory regions, and thereby multiple copies of genes are maintained in the genome  <cit> .

duplicated proteins evolve for some time under relaxed functional constraints, after which functional divergence occurs when formerly neutral substitutions convey a selective advantage in a novel environment or genetic background  <cit> . gene duplication is often followed by an elevated mutation rate  <cit> . rapid duplicate gene evolution is caused by positive darwinian selection or relaxation of the functional constraints in the redundant gene. continuation of gene duplication leads to the formation of gene groups with high similarities in nucleotide and amino acid sequences. the majority of genes in higher organisms are members of multigene families or subfamilies  <cit> . three potential evolutionary fates of duplicated genes have been suggested  <cit> :  duplicated genes may be inactivated by the degenerative mutations and become nonfunctional .  a duplicated gene may diverge to acquire a new function .  degenerative mutations occur in each copy after duplication. both genes may be altered in such a way that the combined activity of the two genes together fulfills the task of the ancestral gene in a complementary fashion   <cit> .

cbf gene family, belongs to ap2/erf  superfamily, is considered as a result of gene duplication  <cit> . functional redundancy and differentiation have been reported, however, evolutional aspect of this small gene family has not been investigated. the ap2/erf superfamily is a large gene family of transcription factors and is defined by the ap2/erf domain, which consists of 60~ <dig> amino acids involved in dna binding. cbf1/dreb1b, cbf3/dreb1a, and cbf2/dreb1c are located in a tandem array within a region of  <dig>  kb on chromosome  <dig>  in arabidopsis thaliana and were categorized into group iiic in the erf family  <cit> . the functions of cbf <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig>  which are induced by cold, have been shown to play crucial roles in the process of cold acclimation in arabidopsis including low temperature-, and/or drought-stress-responsive gene expression  <cit> . cbf binds a dna regulatory element, the c-repeat  dehydration-responsive element , which has a conserved core sequence of ccgac, which imparts responsiveness to low temperatures and dehydration  <cit> . comparisons of the transcriptomes indicated that 12% of the cold-responsive genes are confirmed members of the cbf regulon  <cit> . cbf <dig>  which is located in chromosome  <dig>  is involved in the dehydration response rather than to cold, and is less closely related to cbf <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> in phylogeny  <cit> . the amino acid sequences of the cbf <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> proteins are highly similar, with approximately 88% identities and 91% similarities  <cit> . but do they have redundant functions? by comparing the effects of the overexpression of each cbf gene in arabidopsis, it was determined that, in fact, they induce expression of similar gene sets  <cit> . however, other molecular or physiological studies have indicated functional divergence among cbf genes  <cit> .

in this report, we attempted to characterize the molecular population genetics and gene expression of these three cbf genes from  <dig> ecotypes, and to assess the roles of selective forces that have driven the divergence of these three duplicate genes. usually molecular evolutionary approaches are used to study selection forces on gene sequences; here we have the opportunity to check whether the results from those methods are supported by many studies of the expression and function of cbf genes. our results, coupled with those from other published studies, indicate that functional divergence in cbf <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> resulted from promoter polymorphisms as well as coding sequence variations.

RESULTS
sequence polymorphisms of cbf <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> in arabidopsis thaliana
we obtained cbf genomic sequences from  <dig> geographically distant ecotypes covering europe, north america, russia, north africa, japan, and india . substantial differences of polymorphic patterns were observed among the three cbfs. in the promoter region analyzed, cbf <dig> possessed the highest nucleotide diversity, π  <cit> , of  <dig> , which was 25-fold higher than that of cbf <dig> and  <dig> -fold higher than that of cbf <dig>  a similar trend was observed when another nucleotide diversity estimate, θw  <cit> , was examined . the cbf <dig> promoter region also had the most abundant indels  compared to cbf <dig>  and cbf3's promoter regions . the distributions of indels are demonstrated in the additional file . most polymorphic sites in cbf1's promoter were phylogenetically informative , and the promoter sequences after site  <dig>  seemed to be dominated by dimorphic polymorphism. compared to cbf <dig>  most of the polymorphic sites in cbf2's promoter were singletons, and the frequencies of informative sites and singletons were compatible in cbf <dig> .

a one promoter region for each cbf was excluded because of long sequence indels ; b only cds regions were analyzed ; n, number of sequences analyzed; l, aligned sequence length; l-gaps, sequence length without missing data; h, number of haplotypes; s, number of segregated sites; π, nucleotide diversity estimated by pair-wise comparisons from all sites; πsyn, nucleotide diversity estimated from synonymous sites; πnonsyn, nucleotide diversity estimated from nonsynonymous sites; θw, nucleotide diversity estimated based on segregating sites from all sites. # p <  <dig> ; * p <  <dig> ; ** p <  <dig> ; n.s., not significant.

for cbf transcriptional units  the nucleotide diversity  of cbf <dig> was highest  but close to that of cbf <dig> , while the diversity of cbf <dig> was still the lowest . however, the nucleotide diversity, π, of cbf2's tu was  <dig> -fold higher than that of its promoter . in the cbf coding regions,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> nonsynonymous substitutions were respectively found in cbf <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig>  of the total  <dig> nonsynonymous substitutions, only three were located in ap <dig> domains  which are responsible for dna binding. seven nonsynonymous substitutions were in the n-terminal region where the function is unknown. no amino acid replacement was observed in the nls. twenty-eight nonsynonymous substitutions existed in transcriptional activation domains which were responsible for activation of cbf regulon genes. ten of  <dig> amino acid displacements in cbf <dig> were singletons except for one in the n-terminal region .

ecotypes hi- <dig> and bl- <dig> had lost ten amino acids in cbf1's transcriptional activation domain, but their open-reading frames were still present. a single adenine insertion was found in the cbf <dig> coding region of kas- <dig>  this insertion, located at the beginning of the transcriptional activation domain, led to an early nonsense stop codon in this reading frame, and  <dig> of ~ <dig> residues of this domain had been lost. this c-terminal domain is necessary for activation of the expressions of downstream genes  <cit> . we believe that cbf <dig> in the kas- <dig> ecotype has become a null allele. no indels were found in cbf3's coding regions. we sequenced cbf <dig> coding sequences in  <dig> ecotypes as well, and no indels were found. two nonsynonymous substitutions were observed: one was a singleton and the other was informative.

distinct patterns of sequence polymorphisms were observed in different regions of cbf
tajima's d test was marginally positive in the promoter of cbf <dig> , however, after removing sites before site  <dig> , the d value was significantly positive . this suggests a signature of balancing selection dominating the majority of the cbf <dig> promoter. in the tu of cbf <dig>  the d value was not significant. in contrast to cbf <dig>  both the promoter and tu of cbf <dig> had an excess of singletons, and tajima's d tests were significantly negative . this indicates that the entire region of cbf <dig> was favored by positive selection, and a beneficial allele has been fixed in the population. however, a significant negative d value can also be the result of deriving low-frequency detrimental alleles or a bottleneck effect. the signature of positive selection of cbf <dig> was confirmed by other tests and physiological data as described below. unlike cbf <dig> and - <dig>  neither the promoter nor tu was significant in cbf <dig> 

we scanned different regions of cbf promoters and tus using sliding windows of tajima's d test to identify regions which deviated from neutral expectations. in the promoter of cbf <dig>  d values after about site  <dig>  were positive, and there were three major regions carrying significantly positive d values, especially in regions within  <dig> bp upstream of the tu. we identified no regions which significantly departed from  <dig> in the promoter of cbf <dig>  and no positive d values were observed. in the cbf <dig> promoter, the proportions of positive and negative regions were compatible. a significant positive region  was observed. fluctuations in d values in the tus were smoother than those of the promoter . the entire region of cbf2's tu had a negative d value, and two regions located in the transcriptional activation domain were significantly negative . most of the singletons in these two regions were nonsynonymous substitutions . cbf <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> differed in the n-terminal of the ap <dig> domain where the d value was nearly significant in cbf <dig>  and negative in cbf <dig> and - <dig>  although several informative polymorphisms in cbf <dig> in this region contributed to the difference in d, they were synonymous substitutions.

we obtained four copies of cbf-like sequences from a. lyrata ssp.petraea. one was closest to at cbf <dig>  and three were similar to at cbf <dig>  we found no homologs of cbf <dig> in a. lyrata. a phylogenetic tree was constructed according to haplotypes of cbfs coding regions . haplotypes of different cbf were assorted well to the same lineage according to their cbf classification and the orthologs cbfs  from a. lyrata were just located as outgroups of their assigned lineages. the cbf <dig> was probably duplicated from the common ancestor of cbf2/cbf <dig> before the speciation of a. thaliana and a. lyrata. , but was lost in a. lyrata ; however we could not exclude the possibility that the divergence of cbf <dig> has evolved to such an extent that it could not be found, or the sample size  was simply not large enough.

fay and wu's h, and other statistics which use orthologous sequences as outgroups were computed. to obtain evidence of a recent selective sweep, we used fay and wu's h test, which measures an excess of derived high-frequency mutations to intermediate-frequency mutations. a negative significant h indicates a recent selective sweep. the h value for the cbf <dig> coding region was significant  but not significant in cbf <dig> . we used two statistics, gmean and dks, to detect the heterogeneity of polymorphism-to-divergence ratios in the coding regions of cbf <dig> and - <dig>  sliding windows of the polymorphism-to-divergence ratios were also plotted . fixation of an advantageous mutation leads to a selective sweep which reduces the proportion of polymorphisms. a "valley" in the sliding window plot indicates a sweep, while balanced polymorphism leads to a "peak". gmean is most sensitive for detecting one or two peaks, and dks is good at detecting a single low to high change in polymorphism  <cit> . the gmean tests were significant for both cbf <dig> and - <dig>  and dks was significant for cbf <dig> . the results indicated the presence of heterogeneity of polymorphism-to-divergence ratios in the coding region in cbf <dig> . in other words, localized selective sweeps were detected. thus, the selective sweep event in cbf <dig>  gene was supported by four neutrality tests.

p values of the h statistics were generated by  <dig>  replicate simulations; gmean, mean sliding g statistic; dks, kolmogorov-smirnov statistic; the highest p values of gmean and dks tests are reported in the table. * p <  <dig> ; ** p <  <dig> .

purifying selection acts on cbfs but different levels of divergence were observed among different domains
we computed the ratios of ka/ks between all paired cbf paralogous and orthologous genes . the ratio of ka/ks indicates protein evolution where the values of ω of >  <dig>  =  <dig>  and <  <dig> respectively indicate positive, neutral, and purifying selection. the ratios were comparable among different pair-wise comparisons. the lowest was  <dig>   and the highest was  <dig>  . this indicates that strong purifying selection has been acting on cbfs since their duplication and the speciation of a. thaliana and a. lyrata. although cbf <dig> has been proven to be involved in the dehydration pathway and is not induced by cold  <cit> , this gene's coding region did not diverge much from those of cbf <dig>  - <dig>  or - <dig> based on ka/ks ratios. to scan different divergences along the protein domains, we plotted sliding windows of ka/ks for pairwise comparisons of cbf <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> , and between cbf <dig>  and cbf <dig> . substantial differences in divergences were observed. in the comparisons among cbf <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig>  the ap <dig> domain was the most conserved region especially in the region of the alpha-helix; the n-terminal regions upstream of the nls had moderate ratios ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> ; and the transcriptional activation domain had the greatest divergence which contained two major divergent regions with ratios of  <dig>  and  <dig>  . the higher conservation of the ap <dig> domain in cbf1/2/ <dig> indicates that members of regulons of each cbf should be similar.

a regions containing  <dig> bp upstream from the transcriptional unit  were analyzed; k, average sequence distance between promoter regions of cbfs; b the 5' and 3' untranslated regions  were analyzed; ks, average distance between cbfs estimated using synonymous sites; ka, average distance between cbfs estimated using nonsynonymous sites; n.a., not allowed. c alcbf <dig>  and alcbf <dig> .

compared to the divergence among cold-induced cbf <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig>  the divergent region between dehydration-induced cbf <dig> and cbf <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> was unique. the ap <dig> domains were apparently conserved because there were some gaps in the n-terminal side of this domain. there is a region within the transcriptional activation domain which had ka/ks ratios which were all >  <dig> , a signature of positive selection in protein evolution, in all three comparisons. the three highest ka/ks peaks covered almost the same region .

positive selection in the transcriptional activation domain
so far we have found that the most divergent regions are in the transcriptional activation domains of cbfs; however, the sliding window plots detected no region with a ω  value of >  <dig>  this is because for sliding window plots, each window  overlapped with the previous and following windows because the step size  was smaller than the window size. these sizes of the window and overlapping windows might not have allowed us to detect smaller regions of positive selection or to have precisely located the divergent region. herein we used a non-overlapping sliding window method to locate the existence of positive selection for six residues per window in the transcriptional activation domain.

four regions within this domain were found to carry ka/ks ratios of >  <dig>  including  <dig>  in cbf <dig> and - <dig> ,  <dig>  in cbf <dig> and - <dig> ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   in cbf <dig> and - <dig> comparisons . compared to the sliding windows of figure  <dig>  this approach more-precisely located sites which may be under positive selection . it is worth noting that except for the region labeled  from amino residues  <dig> to  <dig> in the comparison of cbf <dig> and - <dig>  three other regions almost completely overlapped , and therefore actually two regions were under positive selection in this domain after cbf duplication.

we used codeml in the paml <dig>  package  <cit>  to estimate ω values among sites with different models. cbf <dig> sequences could not be computed because too many branches had collapsed after the bootstrap re-sampling. the results of all lrts for cbf <dig> and - <dig> were significant . m2a, m <dig>  and m <dig> all identified a small proportion of protein  with ω values of >  <dig>  while most portions of cbf <dig> and - <dig> were under purifying selection. one positively selected site,  <dig> t  was identified in cbf <dig>  and two sites,  <dig> s  and 151e , were identified in cbf <dig>  nine ecotypes carried  <dig> s instead of  <dig> t in cbf <dig>  while in cbf <dig> and - <dig>  all ecotypes carried a serine residue at this site. seven ecotypes carried  <dig> s instead of  <dig> n, and seven ecotypes carried 151a instead of 151e in cbf <dig> 

gene expression experiments identify several naturally knockout or knockdown of cbfs
in cbf <dig>  a 211-bp region in the 3'-end of promoter was substituted with a 261-bp insertion in ita- <dig>  and a 365-bp insertion was found just  <dig> bp from the transcriptional initiation site in co- <dig> . cbf <dig> expression in ita- <dig> was low, and the signal was still visible within the same expression scale , while co- <dig> had no cbf <dig> expression. although cbf <dig> in cvi- <dig> had lost most of the sequenced promoter , cbf <dig> was still expressed at a low level. in cbf <dig> promoters, an 864-bp region was substituted with a 1798-bp insertion in kas- <dig>  the signal intensity of cbf <dig> expression in kas- <dig> was ~10- <dig> fold compared to those of the others. we believe the 1798-bp substitution removed all cis-elements from the kas- <dig> cbf3's promoter.

in addition to naturally occurring mutants, we found that the expressions of cbf <dig> in cvi- <dig> and co- <dig>  and cbf <dig> in cvi- <dig> and can- <dig> after 4°c treatment for  <dig>  h were consistently low in different batches. however, gene expressions in most other ecotypes were not consistently high or low among batches .

discussion
dna sequence polymorphism
the overall level of genome-wide polymorphism in arabidopsis was estimated in the values between  <dig>  and  <dig>   <cit> . the π values of cbf3's promoter, and cbf <dig> and -3's tus are close to these two estimates. altogether, cbf <dig> was the most highly conserved gene in the promoter region and tu of this small family, and cbf <dig> carried the highest nucleotide diversity in the promoter, the diversity of tu was compatible with that of the tu of cbf <dig>  the nucleotide diversities of promoters of cbfs were greater than those among tus. this suggests that the promoters and tus of cbfs have been subjected to distinct selection mechanisms and/or demographic histories. with respect to protein evolution, ap <dig> domains were very conservative compared to the transcriptional activation domains. this suggests that among cbfs in arabidopsis, the dna targeting abilities have not changed throughout their evolutionary history. the divergence, if any, of cbf biochemical functions should exist in transcriptional activation domains.

different selection forces working on different cbf genes
selection has played a role in the maintenance of conservation in coding sequences among cbf <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> in the form of purifying selection. as to protein evolution, these three duplicate genes are functionally constrained as evidenced by the ka/ks ratios being much lower than the neutral expectation of  <dig> for both paralogs and orthologs . the excess of low-frequency polymorphisms for cbf <dig> indicates that it is strictly constrained. the nucleotide variation in the cbf <dig> promoter was characterized by dimorphism indicating balancing selection, while the entire region of cbf <dig> did not deviate from neutral expectations.

however, a strong population structure and genome-wide deviation from the standard neutral model in a. thaliana were reported  <cit> . nordberg et al.  <cit>  suggested that the skewness of tajima's d of the a. thaliana genome was due to an excess of rare alleles and demographic processes. to reassess the influence of the population structure, we used the mantel test  to evaluate the existence of isolation-by-distance in our dataset. the promoters and transcriptional units of cbf <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> were examined. the results from both regions of cbf <dig> were not significant , but were significant in the promoters of cbf <dig> and - <dig> . it seems the results from tajima's d test of cbf <dig> are independent of the population structure. nevertheless, the population structure is expected to push tajima's d toward positive values  <cit> , and this effect may have partially contributed to the significantly positive d of cbf1's promoter. however, the dimorphism we observed was not related to the geographic distribution of ecotypes. the origins of maintaining such allelic dimorphism are still unclear. this pattern of allelic dimorphism is not unprecedented in arabidopsis, having been reported for many loci including tfl <dig>  <cit> . it may be a result of the demographic history of this species complex  <cit> .

we do think that cbf <dig> played a unique role different from those of cbf <dig> and - <dig> after gene duplication. it is possible that the regulatory function of cbf <dig> was favored by positive selection which was detected in our dataset.

positive selection sites in the transcriptional activation domain
the transcriptional activation domain of cbf <dig> was studied by wang et al.  <cit> , and six hydrophobic cluster motifs were identified by a computational analysis. they used a series of gal4dbd/cbf1ad  fusion constructs containing either nonsense codon introductions or alanine substitutions in cbf1ad to assay their abilities to transactivate the gal4-responsive lacz reporter enzyme in yeast. based on the high sequence identity and the fact that almost the same set of downstream genes can be activated by cbf <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig>  the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of cbf regulons should be very similar. thus, the functional dissection of this domain from cbf <dig> might also be the case in cbf <dig> and - <dig> 

the non-overlapping sliding window of ka/ks suggests that two possible regions were favored by positive selection after gene duplication . these two regions are not located in the hydrophobic clusters  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> which wang et al.  <cit>  considered to have been the most critical motifs in transactivation. in these two regions, four of six residues substituted by alanine led to substantial changes in reporter enzyme activities . it was interesting to note that the activity increase of 162p → a was the highest among substitutions, and 169f → a was also the greatest among those that led to activity decreases.

we want to see whether the positive selection site in the sequence agrees with the two regions mentioned above. with the site models of the codeml program, two positively selected amino acids were identified in the transcriptional activation domain as expected but not locate in the two regions identified by the sliding window of ka/ks method.

a decrease of 26% of reporter enzyme activity was observed when alanine was substituted for  <dig> t of cbf <dig>  and in cbf <dig>  152e is in hydrophobic cluster  <dig>  when the same site in cbf <dig> was substituted by alanine , a 63% increase in reporter activity was observed .

hydrophobic residues within the functionally critical hc <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> of cbfs were found to be conserved among different ecotypes. most positively selected regions of the activation domain identified in this paper are located outside of critical motifs. this difference is because the meaning of ka/ks is different from that of hydrophobic cluster, the former emphasizes variation in amino acid replacement and the latter in no or low variation. it implies that the hydrophobic cluster is critical in the interaction with other activator and the two regions found in this study might involve in tuning the transcriptional activation.

ecotypes from lower latitude may accumulate mutations that reduce cbfs expressions
some variations we found for specific nucleotides of the promoters of cbf <dig> and - <dig> were probably responsible for the low level of gene expression. cbf <dig> of cvi- <dig> has four nucleotides which are unique among the ecotypes , while can- <dig> has two unique nucleotides . cbf <dig> of cvi- <dig> of has four nucleotides which are unique among the ecotypes . however, none of these nucleotides was located in the known cis-element of cbf <dig> or - <dig> when screened by the plantcare website  <cit> .

it is interesting to note that singletons of the cbf <dig> promoters of cvi- <dig> and can- <dig> comprised 35%  of the  <dig> accessions, and nucleotide mutations mainly occurred in accessions collected from lower latitudes . singletons of the cbf <dig> promoters of cvi- <dig> and co- <dig> comprised 16%  of the  <dig> accessions, and nucleotide mutations also mainly occurred in lower latitudes . thus lower latitudes  might allow accumulation of nucleotide mutations in the promoter regions.

evidence of functional diversification in cbf <dig>  - <dig>  and -3
in a study to test for benefits and costs  of cold tolerance, cbf <dig> and cbf <dig> overexpressers showed costs of cold tolerance and no fitness benefits in control and cold environments. cbf1-overexpressing plants showed no fitness costs of cold tolerance in the control environment and showed a marginal fitness benefit in the cold environment  <cit> . a cbf <dig> knockout mutant, cbf <dig>  had a higher capacity to tolerate freezing than wild-type ones which was correlated with stronger and more-sustained expressions of cbf <dig> and cbf <dig> in the mutant. they concluded that cbf <dig> is a negative regulator of cbf <dig> and cbf <dig>  <cit> , and cbf <dig> but not cbf <dig> and cbf <dig> was found as a gene contributed to a major freezing qtl locus  <cit> . moreover, in contrast to cbf <dig>  cbf <dig> and cbf <dig> positively regulate cold acclimation by activating the same subset of cbf-target genes  <cit> . these studies indicated functional changes have occurred at the level of cbf proteins.

ecotype kas- <dig> carries a cbf <dig> knockout allele and a null allele cbf <dig> gene due to a single insertion in the coding region. at first, we predicted that cbf <dig>  which is the only functional cbf induced by cold, in this ecotype would be highly expressed to compensate for the double-mutant effect. however, this prediction was not correct. this is also evidence that cbf <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> are not strictly functional equivalents.

evolutionarily important changes have also occurred at the level of gene regulation in cbf <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> in addition to protein function. chinnusamy et al.  <cit>  identified a mutant, ice <dig> , that results in the cbf <dig> gene no longer being induced in response to low temperature, but which has little effect on cold induction of cbf <dig> and cbf <dig>  cbfs are subjected to different temporal regulation during cold acclimation. recently, novillo et al.  <cit>  further supported that cbf <dig> and cbf <dig> are regulated in a different way then cbf <dig>  although subfunctionalization of the coding region has been detected, subfunction in the promoter is also a process leading to separate expression control of cbfs.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary according to sequence analyses, we demonstrate that different selection forces have been working on the promoter and coding regions of cbf <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig>  after cbf duplication, cbf <dig> experienced selective sweeps in the promoter and coding regions, and this may have resulted in its unique functional divergence which differs from those of cbf <dig> and - <dig>  the promoter of cbf <dig> has a signature of balancing selection, while cbf <dig> did not deviate from neutrality. cbf promoters share less similarity than do the coding regions, indicating they are differentially regulated or have been shaped by different evolutionary forces. there is evidence of positive selection in both the cbf <dig> and -3' transcriptional activation domains within each domain and between them. cbf <dig> and - <dig> were shown to activate same regulons but need to work cooperatively  <cit> , and they are regulated by different upstream factors  <cit> . the function of the progenitor cbf gene has not been determined to date. nevertheless, it seems that the complements of cbf <dig> and - <dig> are under subfunctionalization, while cbf <dig>  with a different regulatory role, might be a case of neofunctionalization.
