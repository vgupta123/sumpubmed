BACKGROUND
with more than  <dig> million deaths a year, tuberculosis  remains a major public health problem. as one-third of the world's population is infected, mycobacterium tuberculosis is probably the most widespread human pathogen and the number of tb cases is growing at a rate of 2% per year  <cit> . this bacterium is remarkably well-adapted to its host, in which it can persist for years without inducing symptoms. despite its worldwide dissemination and presence in diverse host populations, the genetic variability of m. tuberculosis appears to be very low with the exception of hot spot regions in the genome that are associated with mobile elements  <cit> .

previous studies on w-beijing family strains have identified variations in putative dna repair genes . these variations are found only in the w-beijing family; they can therefore be considered to be specific markers of this family and suggest that a mutator phenotype, at least transient, may have contributed to the host adaptation of this family of strains  <cit> .

durbach et al.  <cit>  co-inactivated dna repair genes, namely ada/alka and ogt, in strain h37rv and showed that the resulting mutant displayed a mutator phenotype under nitrosative stress.

while studying the genetic diversity of m. tuberculosis isolates in the central african republic , we described an mdr-prone family characterized by a t family spoligotype and a synonymous variation in the dna repair gene mutt <dig>  <cit> . this prompted us to screen our set of well-defined isolates from car  <cit>  by sequencing putative anti-mutator genes including ada/alka to identify other variations that could be markers of relevant clinical strains.

comparisons of car strain sequences with published "m. tuberculosis complex" genome sequences revealed an snp common to these strains and m. bovis strain af <dig>  this suggests either horizontal dna transfer between m. bovis and m. tuberculosis car strains or convergent evolution. medigue et al. and denamur et al.  <cit>  demonstrated horizontal transfer of dna repair genes in e. coli. to determine whether there has been transfer between m. bovis and m. tuberculosis strains, we looked at polymorphism in the regions upstream and downstream from this common snp by pcr sequencing. we provide evidence that this snp may have occurred twice independently and might therefore be an example of convergent evolution.

RESULTS
variations in the ada/alka and ogt genes in a series of mdr isolates
variations in ada/alka and ogt genes were assessed in fifty-five mdr strains collected between  <dig> and  <dig> in car. pcr products corresponding to ada/alka and those corresponding to ogt were obtained for each mdr car strain in our collection. direct sequencing of pcr products revealed four variations in dna repair genes: one in ogt and three in ada/alka .

the ogt variant is a c to g substitution causing the replacement of a threonine by a serine at position  <dig> in ogt, noted a cc→a gc . this variation is carried by three car isolates. it has been previously observed in other strains and considered to be characteristic of haarlem strains  <cit> .

nine strains carry an act→aat  variation, and five of these strains also display a tgg→tag  variation. this is the first report of a variant involving a nonsense codon in m. tuberculosis. this raised the question of whether such variations also occurred in non-mdr strains.

polymorphism of ada/alka in a series of non-mdr strains 
using the same sequencing approach, we searched for the presence of the nonsense variation tgg→tag  and other ada/alka or ogt polymorphisms in a set of  <dig> well-defined non-mdr strains isolated in car between april 15th and august 15th  <dig> from the cohort studied by espinal et al.  <cit> :  <dig> of these isolates were found to carry sequence variations . twenty-four of the strains carry the act→aat  variation, including three that also carry the tgg→tag .

we searched ada/alka sequences in available "m. tuberculosis complex" genome sequences and found the tgg→tag  variation in m. bovis strain af <dig>  the spoligotypes of the car isolates with the tgg→tag  variation indicate that they are haarlem m. tuberculosis strains. this suggests that this amber mutation has occurred independently in at least two different species of the "m. tuberculosis complex" or that it has been acquired by horizontal dna transfer. to test these possibilities, we studied the polymorphisms of chromosomal regions flanking the tgg→tag  ada/alka snp.

we compared regions flanking the amber variation in m. tuberculosis strains including  car isolates carrying the thr337→asn variation with or without the amber variant,  h37rv,  cdc <dig> and  w-beijing  <dig> and in m. bovis strains including  rca isolates,  strain af <dig> and  bcg pasteur. in addition to the ada/alka gene variations previously found in mdr car strains, we identified two further snps affecting the ada/alka coding sequence: gcg→acg  only found in w-beijing <dig> and ctg→cta  harboured by m. bovis af <dig> and bcg pasteur. we also found six snps outside of the ada/alka coding sequence: snp <dig>  snp <dig> and snp <dig> downstream from ada/alka, and snp <dig>  snp <dig> and snp <dig> upstream from the gene . snps  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were found in all strains except in h37rv. snp <dig> and the atc→gtc  variation were found in all m. bovis strains but not in any car isolates of m. tuberculosis. the ctg→cta  variation is present only in m. bovis af <dig> and bcg pasteur and snp <dig> only in m. bovis af <dig>  in contrast, car m. tuberculosis amber variants also harbour the act→aat  variation and do not carry snp <dig> or snp <dig>  or codon  <dig> and  <dig> modifications. therefore, dna polymorphisms identified in car m. tuberculosis amber variant isolates differ from those observed in m. bovis strain af <dig> . this is not compatible with the occurrence of the amber variation in both groups being a consequence of horizontal transfer and allelic replacement of the entire ada/alka gene. it is therefore more likely that independent events are responsible for the appearance of this variation in the two species, thus suggesting convergent evolution.

spoligotypes of m. tuberculosis strains and relatedness
spoligotyping of all these car isolates has been reported in nouvel et al.  <cit> . spoligotype clusters were named by their shared type number according to the spoligotype database spoldb <dig>  <cit> . we considered the distribution of car amber variant isolates among the clusters. they were found in three different clusters:  "st047" , "st <dig> minus spacer 13"  and "st316" . the act→aat  variation alone  is present in strains of clusters "st047", "st316", "st312" and "st <dig> minus spacers 42–43". these clusters share  <dig>  to  <dig> % spoligotype identity  and could reasonably be considered as a single family.

discussion
in our collection of car isolates, the ada/alka gene variant act→aat  was found in  <dig> isolates, eight of which also carry the tgg→tag  variation. this suggests that the act→aat  mutation appeared before the tgg→tag  mutation.

moreover, strains carrying only the act→aat  variation show spoligopatterns "st047", "st312", "st314", "st316", "st <dig> without spacers 42–43", or "st <dig> without spacers 39". strains carrying both act→aat  and tgg→tag  belong to "st047", "st316" or "st <dig> without spacer 13". all these shared types are similar and differ by a small number of spacers. the spoligopatterns of these  <dig> strains classify them into the haarlem family . however, the strains with act→aat  variation with or without the tgg→tag  variation do not carry variations in ogt: this suggests they are all derived from an ancient haarlem family strain before the appearance of the ogt variants. we propose a genealogy of strains showing a haarlem spoligotype and carrying the amber variation in the ada/alka gene . further studies will be necessary to assess whether these strains are an emerging cluster in car.

the amber variation in ada/alka is also found in m. bovis strain af <dig>  this amber variation is absent from the two m. bovis strains isolated in car analysed in this study . it is also absent from the m. bovis bcg pasteur strain. denamur et al.  <cit>  demonstrated horizontal transfer of dna repair genes between e. coli strains and showed that this led to the appearance of mutator phenotypes. our snp analysis of the ada/alka dna region excludes this possibility for the amber variation. all m. tuberculosis strains carrying the amber variant in our study population harbour the same snps; these snps are different from those found in m. bovisaf <dig>  this argues strongly against horizontal transfer of a region comprising the entire ada/alka gene. therefore, the amber variation probably occurred more than once independently and thus constitutes a case of convergent evolution. the acquisition of this variation may confer a selective advantage on the strain.

in several bacteria, the ada and alka proteins are encoded by two distinct genes. the putative ada/alka gene of m. tuberculosis is similar to the ada and alka genes of e. coli, and is likely to be a fusion of the two genes  <cit> . interestingly, the non-sense mutation we described in car isolates and in m. bovis af <dig> affects the ada part of the gene. presumably, the amber mutation inactivates the ada/alka fused gene and results in a mutator phenotype. indeed, inactivation of this gene results in an increased mutation frequency in m. tuberculosis without any growth impairment in vivo  <cit> . thus, the naturally occurring ada/alka mutants we report here may have the advantage of a high mutation rate without any associated cost in vivo. alternatively, the production of a truncated ada protein may constitutively activate adaptive responses, as has been demonstrated in e. coli  <cit> . in particular, it may provide an improved response to stress in vivo, for instance in the phagosome of activated macrophages  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
an amber stop-codon in ada/alka was detected in some m. tuberculosis haarlem isolates from car and also in m. bovis strain af <dig>  this amber variation appears not to have spread by horizontal gene transfer; this could be a case of convergent evolution between m. tuberculosis and m. bovis. this suggested that acquisition of the variation may confer a selective advantage. the ada/alka genetic locus of m. tuberculosis has been implicated in mutator phenotype expression  <cit> . the variant we report may therefore contribute to adaptation to environmental changes. in addition, we describe polymorphisms in dna repair genes in m. tuberculosis isolates and these could be used for strain characterization.
