BACKGROUND
the effective population size, ne, is defined as the
size of an idealized population that has the same population genetics properties
 as
the actual population. most studies have estimated the within-host
ne for hiv- <dig> during chronic infection to be
~ <dig>  <cit> ,
though one study estimated ne to be between 105
and  <dig> ×  <dig>  <cit> . even
the highest of these estimates is about two orders of magnitude lower than the
number of productively infected cells, estimated to be on the order of 107
to  <dig> cells  <cit> .
explanations for low ne values include unequal viral
reproduction rates  <cit> ,
structured populations  <cit> , and recurrent selection  <cit> . the possibility that recurring
selection may be reducing viral diversity is unsettling because most of the
computational models used to estimate ne assume neutral
evolution.

during a selective sweep of a favorable allele, any neutral alleles linked to the
selected allele will rise in frequency and become overrepresented in the population.
this process, called "hitchhiking", can reduce neutral diversity more than random
genetic drift and therefore reduce ne  <cit> . although selection has been acknowledged as a
possible explanation for the low within-host effective population size during
chronic hiv- <dig> infection  <cit> , high mutation  <cit>  and recombination rates  <cit>  complicate attempts
to study the effects of selection on hiv- <dig> in vivo. to address these
issues, we extended a classic "inbreeding coefficient" method  <cit>  to derive recurrence equations that account for the
combined effects of selection, mutation, and recombination. we then used these
equations to quantify the effects of selection on effective size using parameters
relevant to hiv- <dig> evolution in vivo.

RESULTS
overview of the genetic model
our model follows the basic wright-fisher assumptions of a single haploid
population of constant size with no subdivision or migration, non-overlapping
generations, and random sampling of offspring each generation. we calculated
ne in terms of the inbreeding effective size,
which is based on the change of the average inbreeding coefficient 
at a neutral locus  that is linked to a locus  that is
under selection. the inbreeding coefficient is defined as the probability that
two individuals are identical by descent . therefore, for the neutral locus l, two
individuals are identical by descent if they are derived from a common ancestor
and are identical at locus l, regardless of the status of locus
s. our approach to estimating ne was
to determine changes in the inbreeding coefficient at the neutral locus in the
presence and absence of selection and recombination. the effective population
size was defined as the size of the neutral population that gave changes in the
inbreeding coefficient that were equal to those observed in the presence of
selection and recombination.

as shown in figure 1a, in the absence of recombination, an
offspring can be derived from a parent in the previous generation with either
allele a or a at locus s. an offspring with allele
a can be derived by two pathways: from a parent with allele a
 or a parent with allele a . an offspring with allele a can be derived
by two similar pathways. therefore, ft  will be the sum of the probability that two
offspring are derived from a certain combination of parents  times the probability that the offspring are
identical by descent at locus l .
recombination, an offspring with allele a can be derived from a
parent with allele a  or a parent with allele
a ; an offspring
with allele a can be derived from a parent with allele a
 or a parent with allele a . b) in the presence of
recombination, an offspring with allele a at locus s
can be derived from parent in the previous generation by four
pathways: 1) locus s from a parent with allele a
without mutation or recombination, . 2) locus s from a
parent with allele a following an a to a
mutation but no recombination . 3) locus s from a
parent with allele a without mutation, but with recombination
between another parent with allele a. 4) locus s from
a parent with allele a following an a to a
mutation and recombination between another parent with allele
a. an offspring with allele a can be derived from
parent in four pathways similar to those described above. for the
purpose of illustration, only  <dig> genomes were presented in generation
t- <dig> and t.

in the presence of recombination, loci l and s can be derived
from different parents . an offspring with
allele a or a at locus s can be derived from one or
more parents in the previous generation by the four pathways illustrated inbe the sum of the probability that the two offspring are derived from a certain
combination of pathways  times
the probability that the offspring derived from these pathways are identical by
descent at locus l .

effect of selection on effective population size
we used the ratio n/ne to summarize the reduction in
ne due to selection from the start of selection
at t =  <dig> until t = tnearlyfixed
[the time when the frequency of the advantageous allele reaches
/n]. this last approximation is helpful because
fixation time is asymptotic, with the advantageous allele never reaching 100% in
a deterministic model.

in the absence of mutation, the reduction in ne due
to selection was most strongly affected by the initial frequency of the
advantageous allele, a <dig> .
in the presence of mutation, the reduction in ne
due to selection was most sensitive to the selective advantage,
s, of the advantageous allele .
indeed, for a homogeneous population of n =  <dig>  the
n/ne ratio increased  <dig> –  <dig> fold
with each 10-fold increase in the selection coefficient in the presence of
mutation. however, recombination can break the hitchhiking effect of selection
on ne . for
example, when r ≤ 10- <dig>  for locus l with
u = μ, selection with s =  <dig>  reduced
ne by ~ <dig> fold. in contrast, when r
≥  <dig> , selection with s =  <dig>  had little effect on
ne.

and f <dig> = faa, <dig> =

a <dig> =  <dig>  r =  <dig>  and f0

faa, <dig> =
faa, <dig> =  <dig> 

effective population sizes calculated from the inbreeding coefficient  are usually the same as those calculated
from the variance in the allele frequency , though exceptions do occur  <cit> . to validate our results,
we estimated the effect of selection on ne by
calculating the variance in the frequency of the linked neutral allele from
simulations using the same genetic model. values for the inbreeding
ne obtained from the calculations above
were generally consistent with the estimates of the variance
ne derived from these simulations . we noted that there
was an approximate 3-fold difference in the ne
values between the two methods when s =  <dig>  . this is likely due to the fact that the inbreeding
ne was estimated using a strict deterministic
model; while the variance ne was estimated from
simulations of s =  <dig> , where genetic drift plays a bigger role.

a very high mutation rate at the neutral locus l  also diminished the reduction in ne
due to selection . in the
absence of mutation, the effect of selection was insensitive to changes in the
initial homogeneity at locus l . in
the presence of mutation, selection with an initially heterogeneous population
at locus l caused greater reductions in ne
than selection with an initially homogeneous population. for
f <dig> less than  <dig> , however, further increases in the
initial heterogeneity  did not
lead to further reductions in ne through selection.
interestingly, reductions in ne/n due to
selection were insensitive to changes in the census population size, n
.

effect of recurrent selection on effective population size
for a homogeneous population under recurrent selection, the inbreeding
coefficient of the neutral allele decreased until it reached a quasi-steady
state, where it fluctuated in a regular "sawtooth" fashion . the effect of recurrent selection on
ne was sensitive to selection strength. for
example, for a homogeneous population of n =  <dig> and u
= μ, the decline of ft over time
under recurrent selection with s =  <dig>  overlapped the neutral curve
when n =  <dig> , <dig>  while the decline of ft
under recurrent selection with s =  <dig>  overlapped the
neutral curve when n =  <dig>  . in
other words, recurrent selection had little effect on ne
when s =  <dig> , while recurrent selection reduced
ne by over 300-fold when s =  <dig> 
. this reduction
in ne by recurrent selection could be diminished by
high recombination rates . although
recombination had little impact on the reduction in ne
due to selection under a model with s =  <dig>  and r
≤ 10- <dig>  with r ≥  <dig> , recombination
completely broke the hitchhiking effects of selection on ne
with s =  <dig> .

CONCLUSIONS
we examined the combined effects of selection, mutation, and recombination on the
effective population size of a neutral locus that is linked to a locus under
selection. consistent with other studies  <cit> , we found that
selection can increase the inbreeding coefficient and reduce the inbreeding
effective population size. without mutation, this reduction is primarily determined
by the initial frequency of the advantageous allele, i.e., the lower the initial
frequency, the greater the effect. with mutation, this reduction is mostly
determined by the strength of selection, i.e., the stronger the selection, the
greater the effect. with moderate recombination rates , recurrent selection can substantially lower
ne, though the hitchhiking effect disappears if
the recombination rates are very high .

the effective population size of hiv- <dig> during chronic infection has been shown to be
100- to  <dig> -fold lower than within-host census size. indeed, ctl responses are a
driving force of hiv- <dig> evolution and these responses continuously select for escape
mutants during chronic infection  <cit> . in a comprehensive study of
viral evolution and ctl responses during the first four years of hiv- <dig> infection in
one subject, liu et al.  <cit>  found that of the  <dig> epitopes detected in this subject,
 <dig> were largely replaced by mutants over time. the selection coefficients for the
ctl escape mutant of a single epitope ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  during acute
infection and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  during chronic infection, with an average of  <dig> 
 <cit> . humoral and escape-specific
ctl responses impose additional selective pressures not quantified in liu et
al.  <cit> .
with low to moderate recombination rates, our model shows that recurrent selection
with s =  <dig>  reduces viral effective population size by approximately
300-fold. therefore, during hiv- <dig> infection, selection alone is likely to reduce the
viral effective population size to an ne of
~ <dig>  this result is close to the estimate of
ne~ <dig> ×  <dig> that rouzine and
coffin  <cit>  obtained from a model that
accounts for selection. the small discrepancy may be due to their use of a lower
mutation rate  and
possible biased sampling of sites with higher underlying mutation rates in their
study  <cit> .

with high recombination rates, our model predicts that selection has little effect on
ne. observations of  <dig> to  <dig> cross-over events per
virion in vitro  <cit> 
suggest an intrinsic recombination rate of 10- <dig> to 10- <dig> per
adjacent site per generation. however, this range is not relevant to our model since
these estimates were obtained using heterozygous virions, which may not be abundant
in vivo. while jung and colleagues  <cit>  have demonstrated that cells in the spleen are infected
with multiple viruses ,
they did not determine how often heterozygous virions are formed. more relevant is
data in which scid-hu mice were infected with a 50: <dig> mixture of two marked strains
 <cit> . two-to-three weeks after
infection, an average of ~ <dig> % of infected cells carried a phenotypic marker of
recombination . conservatively assuming a
single generation of recombination, we estimate from equation  that
the probability of recombination between their two markers 
was r = ~
paa/
=  <dig> / = ~ <dig> × 10- <dig> per virion per generation
– a value too low to break the hitchhiking effects of selection in our model.
however, we recognize these are approximate values obtained from a somewhat
artificial system. hiv- <dig> evolution studies could benefit from additional studies of
marked viruses in animal models and clever retrospective analyses of in vivo
data from humans to determine evolutionarily relevant recombination rates.
