BACKGROUND
human adenovirus type  <dig>  early region 1a  is the first viral gene expressed during infection and plays a critical role in transcriptional activation  <cit> . the primary e1a transcript is differentially spliced, yielding mrnas encoding two major products of  <dig> residues  and 243r respectively . these proteins share identical amino and carboxyl sequences and only differ by the presence of an additional  <dig> amino acids in the 289r protein  <cit> . the region unique to the 289r e1a protein is highly conserved amongst the e1a proteins of different adenovirus serotypes, and is referred to as conserved region  <dig>   <cit> . the 289r e1a protein is thought to be primarily responsible for activation of gene expression, as mutations within cr <dig> generally abolish e1a transactivation  <cit> . an adjacent acidic region spanning residues 189– <dig>  termed auxiliary region  <dig> , is also essential for efficient transactivation of early viral promoters by e1a  <cit> .

the mechanism by which cr <dig> of e1a activates transcription has been studied intensely. cr <dig> binds numerous sequence specific transcription factors  <cit>  via a promoter targeting region embedded within cr <dig>  <cit> . these interactions are thought to localize e1a to target promoters in the infected cell. when tethered to dna by fusion to a heterologous dna binding domain , the need for the promoter targeting region is bypassed and cr <dig> functions as a powerful transcriptional activator  <cit> .

mutations within the promoter targeting region exhibit a dominant negative effect on transcriptional activation by wild-type e1a  <cit> , suggesting that these mutants sequester limiting factors necessary for transactivation by wild-type e1a. the first of these limiting factors to be identified was tbp  <cit> . the sur2/trap150β/med <dig> component of the mediator/trap complex was identified to be the second critical target of cr <dig>  <cit> . distinct roles for different proteasome complexes and p300/cbp in cr <dig> dependent transcription have also been shown  <cit> .

when fused to a heterologous dbd, a second transactivation domain was identified within the n-terminal/cr <dig> portion of e1a  <cit> . this region of e1a binds multiple transcriptional regulators, including the p <dig>  cbp  and pcaf acetyltransferases, tbp, trrap and p <dig>  <cit> . paradoxically, this region functions as a transcriptional repression domain in the context of the e1a 243r protein by sequestering limiting factors, such as p <dig> and cbp, from cellular transcription factors  <cit> . indeed, recent work has shown that expression of e1a 12s induces global changes in histone h <dig> k <dig> acetylation, consistent with the sequestration/retargeting of p300/cbp by e1a  <cit> .

e1a is the product of a virus that infects human cells. however, both domains of e1a that function in mammalian cells as transcriptional activators when fused to a heterologous dbd also function as transcriptional activators in yeast  <cit> . indeed, yeast have been exploited extensively as a model system to genetically study the mechanisms of e1a action  <cit> .

using a yeast model system, we have evaluated the role of histone modifying and chromatin remodelling complexes on the activity of the two transcriptional activation domains of hadv- <dig> e1a. these results show that the two activation domains of e1a function via distinct but overlapping mechanisms and suggest that yeast can serve as a valid model system for identifying new targets of e1a involved in transcriptional regulation.

RESULTS
lexa dbd fusions of e1a activate transcription in yeast
e1a contains two independent regions that function as transcriptional activation domains when expressed as dbd fusions in mammalian cells. we have previously shown that these same regions function as transcriptional activation domains in yeast when fused to the gal <dig> dbd  <cit> . to apply yeast genetic approaches to further understand how e1a influences transcription, we assessed the role of histone modifying and chromatin remodelling complexes on the activity of these two transcriptional activation domains of hadv- <dig> e1a. specifically, we expressed the n-terminal  <dig> amino acids of e1a and the region spanning residues 139– <dig>  which encompasses cr <dig> and ar <dig> of e1a, as fusions to the lexa dbd . the e. coli derived lexa dbd was chosen instead of the yeast gal <dig> dbd to eliminate confounding effects of normal gal <dig> regulation on the transcriptional activity of the e1a fusions. in addition, the lexa-e1a fusions did not inhibit yeast growth as substantially as the corresponding gal <dig> dbd fusions  <cit> . importantly, both portions of e1a retained transcriptional activation function as lexa dbd fusions .

role of the saga, ada and slik chromatin modifying complexes
we transformed plasmids expressing each e1a activation domain as a lexa dbd fusion as well as a β-galactosidase reporter gene under the control of a lexa responsive element into the wild-type yeast strain by <dig> and isogenic strains in which components of the saga and related ada and slik complexes were disrupted . saga components can be subdivided into four general classes. ada <dig>  spt <dig> and spt <dig> are required for the structural integrity of the complex and their disruption resulted in a complete abrogation of activation dependent on the e1a n-terminus. gcn <dig>  ada <dig> and ada <dig> are necessary for acetyltransferase activity, and their disruption also impaired activation by the e1a n-terminus. indeed, the gcn <dig> acetyltransferase appeared to be the most important component of this module as its loss resulted in a 68% decrease in activity . spt <dig> and spt <dig> function in tbp recruitment by the complex and their disruption reduced activation by the n-terminus of e1a, although loss of spt <dig> had a more profound effect. recent work has shown that spt <dig> directly contacts tbp and that this interaction is critical for recruiting tbp to saga-dependent promoters and stimulating transcription  <cit> . ubp <dig> and sgf <dig> comprise the histone deubiquitylation module in saga, and did not influence activation by the n-terminus of e1a. deletion of sgf <dig> and rtg <dig> also reduced activation by the n-terminus of e1a, whereas the ahc <dig> component of the ada complex was not required. based on these results, transcriptional activation by the n-terminus of e1a is primarily dependent on the components necessary to maintain the integrity of saga/slik  <cit>  and the tbp recruitment function of spt <dig> in particular, but is less dependent on the gcn <dig> acetyltransferase and the ubp <dig> deubiquitinase activities. although transcriptional activation by the n-terminus of e1a in yeast does not require the ada complex, it requires saga/slik, which may in some cases possess overlapping activities  <cit> . similarly to the n-terminus, activation by e1a cr <dig> required the structural integrity of the saga complex, the tbp recruitment function of spt <dig> and was independent of the ada specific component ahc <dig> . however, cr <dig> was more dependent on the saga acetyltransferase components  and the ubp <dig> deubiquitinase, and was not influenced by the slik specific component rtg <dig> . western blot analysis confirmed that e1a was still expressed in these strains .

our previous work showed that the n-terminal and cr <dig> regions of e1a fused to the gal <dig> dbd inhibits yeast growth in a saga dependent fashion. in that study, disruption of any saga component, including gcn <dig> and ada3/ngg <dig> abrogated growth inhibition by either the n-terminus or cr <dig>  <cit> . another study also showed that growth inhibition by the n-terminus of e1a required numerous other saga components  <cit> . based on these observations, growth inhibition is clearly related to interaction with the saga complex, but is not a direct result of e1a dependent transcriptional activation. in mammalian cells, the n-terminus of e1a binds pcaf <cit>  and mammalian gcn <dig>  <cit> , the two human orthologues of yeast gcn <dig>  these interactions are important, as it is known that e1a is transiently recruited to a subset of cellular promoters that are associated with cell cycle control and growth during infection. e1a induces a localized enrichment of histone acetyltransferases, including pcaf, at these loci and activates transcription  <cit> .

influence of the mediator complex on e1a dependent transcriptional activation in yeast
in yeast, like higher eukaryotic cells, the mediator complex interacts with rna polymerase ii and functions as both a coactivator and corepressor  <cit> . it is well established that e1a cr <dig> targets the sur2/trap150β/med <dig> component of the mediator/trap complex in mammalian cells, which is necessary for efficient transcriptional activation  <cit> . yeast mediator is comprised of the gal <dig>  med9/ <dig> and srb <dig> modules, and gal <dig> is the sur2/trap150β/med <dig> orthologue  <cit> . we examined e1a dependent activation in strains lacking the non-essential components of the mediator complex . interestingly, activation by the n-terminus of e1a decreased in all mediator knockout strains, regardless of which module was targeted . this suggests that the n-terminus requires multiple mediator modules, either directly or indirectly to stimulate transcription. in contrast, activation by cr <dig> was reduced only by deletion of the srb <dig> or rox <dig> components of the srb <dig> module. deletion of gal <dig>  the yeast orthologue of sur2/trap150β/med <dig>  or the pdg <dig> and sin <dig> components of the gal <dig> module had no effect on cr <dig> dependent activation. these results indicate that cr <dig> dependent activation in yeast is not as strongly dependent on mediator as it is in mammalian cells.

role of the swi/snf chromatin remodelling complex in e1a dependent transcriptional activation in yeast
the swi/snf complex alters chromatin structure in an atp-dependent manner  <cit> . activation by the e1a n-terminal domain fused to the lexa dbd was reduced in most yeast strains lacking components of swi/snf with the exception of the swi3Δ, snf11Δ and swp73Δ strains . similarly, activation by cr <dig> was also decreased in yeast lacking multiple components of the swi/snf complex, including the swi3Δ strain . however, impairment of cr <dig> activation was more profound in these strains. these results suggest that the swi/snf dependent chromatin remodelling complex is targeted by both activation domains of e1a, but is more critical for cr <dig> dependent transcriptional activation. others have reported that targeted histone acetylation by the saga complex predisposes promoter nucleosomes for displacement by the swi/snf complex, in a snf <dig> dependent fashion  <cit> . in agreement with this, cr <dig> dependent activation is more dependent on the gcn <dig> acetyltransferase function of saga and the snf <dig> atpase of the swi/snf complex than is activation by the n-terminus of e1a . a genetic screen in yeast previously identified the swi/snf complex as a target of the n-terminus of e1a  <cit> . that study demonstrated that the n-terminus of e1a blocked swi/snf function and inhibited yeast growth. in mammalian cells, the n-terminus of e1a interacts with p <dig>  a swi <dig> family member  <cit> . although this interaction is required for oncogenic transformation by low levels of e1a  <cit>  and suppression of egfr expression  <cit> , the exact effects of this interaction on transcriptional activation by e1a are not clear. a role for swi/snf in transcriptional activation by cr <dig> in mammalian cells has not been shown. our results in yeast suggest that this could be a promising area of future investigation.

influence of bre <dig>  rad <dig>  compass/set1c complex and dot <dig> complex on e1a dependent transcriptional activation in yeast
human bre <dig>  a histone h2b-specific ubiquitin ligase, functions as a coactivator by increasing human h2b k <dig> ubiquitylation and histone h <dig> k <dig> and k <dig> trimethylation  <cit> . cr <dig> activity was reduced in a bre1Δ strain to less than 8% activity . furthermore, disruption of rad <dig>  the corresponding ubiquitin conjugase, or conversion of the yeast h2b target lysine to arginine  also abrogated cr <dig> dependent activation to levels of less than 10%. loss of bur <dig>  which is required for histone h2b monoubiquitination and functions as a component of the kinase complex that phosphorylates rad <dig>  <cit> , reduced cr <dig> dependent activation to a lesser extent. cr <dig> expression was not reduced in these strains . however, deletion of the genes encoding the ubc <dig> or ubc <dig> ubiquitin conjugases, the rad <dig> interacting ubiquitin ligase ubr <dig>  or the rad <dig> interactor rad <dig>  which are not involved in histone ubiquitylation, reduced cr <dig> dependent activity to levels similar to that observed in the bur2Δ strain . these results suggest a key role for bre <dig> and rad <dig> mediated ubiquitylation of h2b in cr <dig> dependent activation in yeast. interestingly, deletion of the ubp <dig> saga component, which removes the ubiquitin group from h2b k <dig>  is also impaired for cr <dig> dependent activation . a reduction in saga dependent transcription has been observed previously in ubp8Δ yeast  <cit> .

similarly to cr <dig>  transcriptional activation by the n-terminus of e1a was reduced in most of these strains . however, the level of impairment was not as pronounced as observed with cr <dig>  unexpectedly, the reductions observed in the bre1Δ and rad6Δ strains were not reflected in a similar reduction in the h2b k123r strain, suggesting that the bre1/rad <dig> ubiquitinylation complex may have additional targets beyond h2b k <dig>  a possibility that is supported by our observation that the ubp <dig> deubiquitinase, which removes the ubiquitin moiety from h2b k <dig>  is similarly not required for activation by the n-terminus .

ubiquitylation of histone h2b k <dig> is required for trimethylation of histone h <dig> k <dig> and k <dig>  modifications often associated with active transcription  <cit> . we next tested the role of h <dig> k <dig> methylation in e1a activity using strains lacking components of the compass/set1c complex. deletion of bre <dig>  sdc <dig> or spp <dig>  which are preferentially required to direct h <dig> k <dig> trimethylation  <cit> , impair cr <dig> function . deletion of the swd <dig>  swd <dig> and shg <dig> components of the complex also reduced cr <dig> dependent activation . cr <dig> expression was not reduced in these strains . h <dig> k <dig> methylation in yeast is mediated by dot <dig>  and activation by cr <dig> was reduced in the dot1Δ strain by about 50% . these results suggest that recruitment of a bre <dig> orthologue and accompanying h <dig> k <dig> trimethylation may be an important component of cr <dig> dependent activation by e1a in mammalian cells, which deserves future study. activation by the n-terminus of e1a was reduced to a lesser extent in these strains compared to cr <dig> and was not substantially affected by the deletion of sdc <dig> and dot <dig> . these results substantiate the data presented in figure 5a, suggesting that h2b ubiquitinylation and subsequent h <dig> k <dig> methylation are not as critical for activation by the n-terminus of e1a as they are for cr <dig> 

influence of the isw <dig> complexes and spt <dig> on e1a dependent transcriptional activation in yeast
h <dig> k <dig> trimethylation by set <dig> has been reported to stimulate recruitment of isw <dig> and its associated complexes to chromatin  <cit> . however, the isw <dig> complexes don't play general roles in transcriptional regulation as knockout of the isw <dig> atpase component of the complex does not effect yeast growth. this complex appears to repress a subset of yeast genes as about  <dig> genes are activated by more than  <dig> -fold in an isw1Δ strain  <cit> . deletion of components of the isw <dig> complex reduced activation by the n-terminus of e1a modestly or not at all in the case of ioc <dig> . however, loss of any component of the complex stimulated cr <dig> dependent activation. given that cr <dig> dependent transcriptional activation depends on compass/set1c induced h <dig> k <dig> trimethylation , it would be predicted that this modification would lead to enhanced recruitment of the repressive isw <dig> chromatin remodelling complexes. thus, in the absence of isw <dig> components, cr <dig> could function more effectively, which is what was observed.

the conversion of rna polymerase into an elongating form is influenced by drb sensitivity inducing factor   <cit> . dsif in yeast is comprised of spt <dig>  which is an essential protein, and spt <dig> which is not. interestingly, transcriptional activation by either portion of e1a was abrogated in the spt4Δ strain , suggesting that both activation domains of e1a also influence transcriptional elongation in yeast and that this may be a good system to further study this activity.

influence of the ino <dig>  nua <dig>  nua <dig>  paf, rsc, sas, csc and swr <dig> complexes on e1a dependent transcriptional activation in yeast
we tested yeast strains lacking components of the ino <dig>  rsc, swr <dig> atp dependent chromatin remodelling complexes, the nua <dig>  nua <dig> and sas acetylation complexes, the csc silencing complex, the paf lysine methyltransferase complex and several arginine methyltransferases for their effects on e1a dependent activation . in general, relatively modest changes were observed, with a few exceptions where a single unique component of a complex affected e1a dependent transcription. no direct explanation could be found for these results, although we noted that many of these genes had synthetic genetic phenotypes with other transcriptional regulators essential for e1a dependent transactivation. future developments in understanding the unique effects of these proteins may lead to additional understanding of e1a dependent transcription.

the possibility remains that disruption of certain genes could alter the copy number of the psh <dig> reporter construct used in these studies. to test this, a cassette consisting of the lexa responsive lacz reporter was integrated into the gal <dig> locus by homologous recombination in five randomly selected deletion strains. results obtained using the integrated reporter or psh <dig> were comparable , suggesting that any changes in reporter plasmid copy number caused by these individual gene disruptions did not substantially influence the results obtained in these strains. however, it remains a possibility that changes in copy number might contribute to small differences in activation in other strains.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our analysis of the influence of chromatin remodelling and histone modifying complexes on e1a dependent activation of transcription in s. cerevisiae provides new evidence that there are many similarities, and some differences between transcriptional control by e1a in yeast and mammalian cells. thus, functional analysis of e1a in yeast using genetic approaches has the potential to uncover novel mechanistic aspects of e1a function. furthermore, genome wide analysis of e1a activity in yeast has the potential to identify novel pathways that also influence e1a function in mammalian cells.
