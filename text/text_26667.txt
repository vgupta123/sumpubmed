BACKGROUND
an intriguing question in biology is how are genes organized and regulated in the three dimensional space of the nucleus. transcriptional regulation was thought to be one dimensional along the linear genomic dna sequence until the wide application of chromatin structure capture experiments, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization   <cit>  and chromatin conformation capture  assay  <cit> . a recent hi-c protocol, an emerging high throughput technology, has the ability to probe three-dimensional  architecture and capture chromatin interactions in a genome-wide scale  <cit> . in the study, lieberman-aiden et al. modeled the hi-c data as a probability matrix at a large scale  and revealed the folding principles of genome organization with a sub-domain of chromatin to form genome-wide compartments. however, this study did not quantitatively correlate the 3d chromatin interactions with epigenetic marks, gene expression profiling, and transcriptional regulation. among the recent efforts to study the effect of genomic chromatin organization on gene regulation, one study  <cit>  showed high correlation between binding sites of ccctc-binding factor  and chromatin interaction identified using the hi-c data  <cit> . however, it still lacked in the utilization of other publicly available resources such as epigenetic modifications data. moreover, the initial single time point hi-c experiment can only depict a static chromatin structure. thus, the questions of how the chromatin organization changes upon environmental stimulation such as hormone and chemicals and how these genomic interactions are associated with disease development and progression remains elusive.

in this study, utilizing an estrogen receptor-α  positive breast cancer cell line, mcf <dig>  before  and after estrogen treatment  as a model system, we investigate these biological questions and address how e <dig> stimulation will affect chromatin interactions resulting in altering gene regulation and their relations with epigenetic modification states. about ~75% breast tumors is in response of estrogen through erα, which has been reported to regulate distant target genes by long-range chromatin interactions in our previous study  <cit> . other previous studies have also linked chromatin organization changes to erα positive patients and prognoses of the disease  <cit> . thus, it is reasonable to speculate that these chromatin structure changes contribute to tumor development and proliferation.

to further address this at a genome-wide scale, we performed the hi-c protocol in mcf <dig> cells at e2-treated and control conditions. we identified chromosomal interacting regions with different levels of interacting frequency as well as e2-mediated differential chromosomal interactions, and further correlated them with eight histone modification marks, dna methylation, regulatory elements regions, erα and pol-ii binding activities. by integrating different ‘omics data in mcf <dig> cells, we sought to reveal associations between high frequent interaction regions, differential chromosomal interactions, epigenetic modifications and gene regulations upon e <dig> stimulation, and to provide insight into the effect of chromatin interaction on e2/erα regulated downstream genes in breast cancer cells.

RESULTS
identification of e2-mediated high frequency chromosomal interacting regions
we applied the hi-c method  <cit> , an experimental protocol developed for identifying genome-wide high order chromosomal interacting regions, to the e2-treated and control conditions in mcf <dig> cells. mcf <dig> is a model breast cancer cell line widely used for mechanistic studying of erα positive breast cancer. a total of ~ <dig> and ~ <dig> millions of raw paired sequence reads were obtained for e2-treated and control conditions respectively. of them, ~ <dig> and ~ <dig> millions reads were uniquely mapped to the human genome. we then divided the whole genome into a 1 mb window-size of chromosome regions, followed by calculating a z-score  for each chromosome region  <cit> , where a z-score measures how many standard deviations an observed value is above or below the mean value. this was used to illustrate the relative intensity of chromosomal interactions in a 1 mb resolution. for example, a higher positive z-score indicates the observed chromosome region has a much higher interaction frequency than the average. we then constructed genome-wide chromosomal interaction matrices for both e2-treated and control conditions as shown in additional file 1: figures s1a,b respectively. we further computed chromosomal interaction frequency for every 1 mb region based on the z-score, i.e. the number of non-zero z-scores in the region divided by the total number of 1 mb regions in the human genome . we found that under the same cutoff value for chromosomal interaction frequency, the number of interactions at e2-treated condition was less than that in the control condition. in particular, the difference was more dramatic at a higher interaction frequency  than that at the lower one. the same trend was also observed in a repeated analysis with 2 mb window-sizes, additional file 1: tables s <dig> 

we subsequently examined the top  <dig> highest chromosomal interacting regions above 30% interaction frequency at control condition , as defined as top  <dig> hot regions, where  <dig> of them remain above 30% interaction frequency and the rest  <dig> drop to > =25% interaction frequency at e2-treated condition. although the difference of interaction frequencies between the e2-treated and control conditions is not significant, all chromosomal regions showed higher interaction frequency at the control condition than those at the e2-treated condition, suggesting that the chromosomal interaction frequency may be reduced upon e <dig> stimulation. to understand the erα binding information within these high frequency interacting regions, a publicly available  <cit>  chip-seq data of erα at the e2-treated and control condition in mcf <dig> cells was used. a total number of ~ <dig>  and ~ <dig>  peaks were called by using w-chipeaks  <cit>  in control and an e <dig> treated dataset, respectively. these peaks were used to examine the relationship between er occupancy and interaction frequency. the number of erα binding sites was greatly increased in the e2-treated condition in the top  <dig> interaction hot regions . in particular, the results showed a significant increase in binding intensity of erα in e2-treated condition when compared to that in the control condition . genome-wide, the regions with higher interaction frequencies also had higher erα binding occupancy: for example, at chromosome  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> .

the corresponding interaction frequency in e2-treated condition  is also listed. chip-seq read count represents erα binding intensity, and chip-seq binding sites represent the number of binding sites.

in a repeat analysis using 2 mb window-sizes, similar results were obtained . this suggests that e <dig> may have a higher chance to trigger stronger erα binding and regulate genes at the higher interaction frequency regions. as a result, three loci close to the top  <dig> interaction hot regions were selected, including thrap <dig> , ints <dig>  and cadps , genes within a higher interaction frequency region , and c16orf <dig>  from a middle level interaction frequency region , and zim <dig>  as a negative control , to validate the e2-treated chromosomal interactions by quantitative 3c-pcr . the interaction was observed in thrap <dig>  ints <dig>  cadps and c16orf <dig> loci upon 1 hr of e <dig> treatment .

linking chromatin interaction with genome rearrangement
cancer cells are highly disrupted. for mcf <dig> cells, a previous study  <cit>  has shown that a total of  <dig>  break-points were induced by somatic rearrangement using bacs combing with pyrosequencing techniques. interestingly, we observed a high overlap rate between the hot  <dig> regions and genomic break and fusion sites. by comparing a total of  <dig> break-points,  <dig> of  <dig>  are within the top  <dig> hot regions identified in our study  while only  <dig> is within the top  <dig> cold regions. this may suggest interaction hot regions on chromosome  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> are frequently rearranged in mcf <dig> cells. however, a primary concern of identifying chromatin interaction is that fusion sites produced by genomic rearrangement might introduce false positive interactions between two physically joint loci. several lines of evidence may ease this concern. first, one advantage of the hi-c protocol is that the hybrid junctions are labeled with biotin; therefore, if a junction was caused by a rearrangement, no biotin label is added and it cannot be pulled down by avidin. thus, theoretically, hi-c protocol can eliminate these types of artificial interactions due to the genomic rearrangements. second, in a recent study in k <dig> cells  <cit> , no interaction identified using hi-c data was found within 20 kb distance of  <dig> identified fusion sites. third, another recent study demonstrated that three-dimensional organization of genome contributes to chromosomal translocations in mouse leukemia virus  which transformed pro-b cells by combining hi-c and high-throughput genome-wide translocation sequencing  analysis  <cit> . the same study found that intra-chromosomal translocation frequency is correlated with hi-c contact probability.

although we did not perform htgts in this study, nevertheless, our simple comparison between fusion sites and interacting regions suggests that the highest frequency interactions may facilitate the chromosome translocation in this breast cancer cell line. we further speculate that chromosome translocation may further enhance the chromatin reorganization at the junction region and promote the formation of chromatin interaction. such an intensive interactive environment may increase the chance of aberrant dna amplification, and thus form multiple copy number inverted repeats or tandem repeat regions on these chromosomes. the inter-chromosomal interactions identified between these fusion sites may represent actual intra-chromosomal interactions on the rearranged derivative chromosome in the cancer cell. taken together, our initial results suggest a link between chromosomal interactions with translocations in the breast cancer model system.

characterization of e2/erα-regulated genes in both highest and lowest frequency chromosomal interacting regions
in the top  <dig> hot regions , there are  <dig> e2/erα-regulated genes. functional gene ontology  analysis  shows that the top go biological processes are protein amino acid dephosphorylation and intracellular receptor-mediator signaling pathways. tissue expression study of those genes suggests that they are highly enriched in breast  cancer disease, mammary gland normal, mammary gland neoplasia and ovary neoplasia. more importantly, those genes are often linked to human disease such as breast cancer and adult human height. a more detailed description of functional annotation results are listed in additional file  <dig>  correlation coefficient of expression  profiles  <cit>  between the e2-treated and control conditions is ~ <dig> , which suggests that e <dig> stimulation may not alter expression levels of genes in higher frequency chromosomal interaction regions dramatically . taken together, the identified  <dig> hot regions  contain many genes that are linked to human disease such as breast cancer, which indicates that chromosomal regions with higher interaction frequency may play a pivotal role in genome regulation.

the top  <dig> of each functional annotation are presented here.

for comparison purposes with the top  <dig> hot regions, the top  <dig> cold regions with the lowest interaction frequency was also studied . there are  <dig> genes in the top  <dig> cold regions . the result of functional annotation go  <cit>  analysis reveals that genes located in cold regions are enriched in phosphatidylcholine biosynthetic process, phosphatidylcholine metabolic process, ethanolamine and derivate metabolic process. for tissue expression tests  <cit> , genes of interaction cold regions are often linked to thalamus, testis, brain and cardiac myocytes . however, genes of hot regions are linked to breast cancer disease such as bach <dig>  rad51c, cyp24a <dig> and ncoa <dig>  such functional difference between genes located in the chromosomal interaction hot regions and cold regions is also observed in the top  <dig> interaction hot  and cold regions , respectively . in particular, there are various transcription factor binding sites detected in the chromosomal interaction hot regions but none of them appeared in the interaction cold regions. thus, the results suggest that estrogen may stimulate those mammary-specific genes of higher frequency interaction with other genomic regions to drive the breast tumorigenisis.

next, we examined whether these breast cancer related genes were associated with genomic break and fusions. interestingly, we found that two of five genes, namely rad51c and noca <dig>  have dna break sites within the gene body region. in contrast to the well-known chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> fusion  in human chronic myelogenous leukemia or the translocation of ets family transcription factors in prostate cancer, no dominant causal gene fusion events in breast cancer patients has yet been reported. the difference between these cancers combined with the observation that breast cancer genes are enriched within chromatin interaction hot regions which has a high rearrangement rate suggests a critical role of chromatin interactions in breast cancer. this result indicates another potential pathway for breast cancer development, in which, oncogenes might be brought to an intensive interacting environment such as these hot regions, thus more subject to the chromosome translocation.

next, the selected top  <dig> cold and hot regions were compared to a previous study conducted by the chia-pet in mcf <dig> cells  <cit> , a different technology to identify e2/erα regulated chromatin interactions. interestingly, the identified top  <dig> hot regions in this study are overlapping with interaction regions identified by chia-pet experiments . however, for the top  <dig> interaction cold regions, none of them are matched to the interaction regions provided by fullwood et al. this comparison not only validated our technology and analysis but also further supported a notion that highly frequent interaction regions such as the top  <dig> hot interaction regions truly exist. the high interaction regions may drive breast cancer development and progression.

quantification of e2-mediated differential chromosomal interactions
after revealing the correlation between chromosomal interaction frequency and gene regulations such as gene expression and epigenetic modifications  in e2-treated and control conditions, respectively, we wanted to further quantitatively measure the difference of chromosomal interactions between the e2-treated and control conditions. first, we plotted the differential chromosomal interactions heatmap comparing the overall interaction frequency changes before and after e <dig> treatment. the results suggest that the overall chromosome interaction frequency and pattern are changed for all chromosomes . then, by calculating a relative ratio  for each pair of interacting 1 mb window-size regions between the two conditions, a human chromosomal interaction change could be estimated. the distribution of the relative ratios for all regions  showed that a majority  of absolute relative ratios close to  <dig> . a similar pattern was also observed in 2 mb window-size . this suggests that most of chromosomal interactions are either strengthened or weakened after e2-treatment.

an interaction change with an absolute relative ratio of  <dig> and the corresponding z-scores of larger than  <dig> is defined as a strong chromosomal interaction change between the e2-treated and control conditions . this can be further classified into four types, the gain- or loss-, intra- or inter-chromosomal interactions. a detailed list of the four types of interactions is shown in additional file  <dig>  we observed that there are more than three times the number of gain-intra-chromosomal interactions than the number of loss-intra-chromosomal interactions at e2-treated condition and, by contrast, the number of gain-inter-chromosomal interactions are much less than the number of loss-inter-chromosomal interactions under the same condition. in total, the number of gain-chromosomal interactions is less than the number of loss-chromosomal interactions at e2-treated condition. a similar trend was also observed in the analysis of a dataset with a smaller chromosomal interaction change .

a genome-wide plot of the distribution of strong chromosomal interaction changes along  <dig> human chromosomes  showed that that the frequency of gain- and loss- interactions in every region  is symmetrically distributed along the chromosomes. a repeated analysis in 2 mb resolution showed similar results . additionally, a scatter plot of the rank order of the number of gain or loss chromosomal interactions verses the number of putative erα binding sites for  <dig>  chromosome regions in human genome was made , which showed the higher interaction frequency and the more erα binding sites are found. in particular, we observed that seven of the top  <dig> regions with the most gain- or loss interactions  are overlapping with the top  <dig> hot regions . together, our results demonstrated that genome-wide chromosomal interactions are changed before and after e <dig> treatment. for example, inter-chromosomal interactions were gained but higher chromosomal interaction frequency was reduced upon estrogen stimulation. more importantly, chromosomal interaction frequency is positively associated with the number of erα binding sites.

correlation between e2-mediated differential chromosomal interactions and epigenetic modifications
to determine correlations among chromosomal interaction frequency, epigenetic marks and transcriptional regulation, eight publicly available histone marks  <cit>  , dna methylation, pol-ii level and regulatory activity  were used to calculate the log transformation of read counts for genes within every 1 mb window-size region. here ~16% of 1 mb chromosome regions  were excluded from the analysis because there is no gene in these regions. in order to determine the role of each specific regulatory region for any given gene, we further divided each gene into the three regulatory regions in reference to a 5’ transcription start site ,  <dig> kb upstream,  <dig> kb downstream and gene body. then, the mean of log transformed read counts for each part at the 1 mb chromosome region were computed and displayed in a heat map , with the order of chromosome regions sorted by the interaction frequency at the control condition. the results showed that there is a clear separation between the interaction hot regions  and the interaction cold regions .

in order to understand the epigenetic influence on four types of interactions and gene regulation, a t-test was used to evaluate the significance of changes on six histone marks , pol-ii level and regulatory activity , between the e2-treated and control conditions on genes  located in the four types of interacting regions. two histone marks  and dna methylation were not included in the analysis due to lack of e2-treated condition. the result  showed that h3k4me <dig>  h3k27me <dig>  h3k9ac and h3k14ac are increased in the e2-treated condition when compared to the control condition for four types of chromosomal changes, while h3k9me <dig> and pol-ii are decreased upon e <dig> treatment. furthermore, the h3k4me <dig> level remains unchanged between the two conditions. in addition, the tests on the erα binding site and the chromosomal interaction frequencies show that the former one is highly enriched at the e2-treated condition but the latter one is reduced at the same condition. a similar result was also obtained by performing a mann–whitney u test on the same data as well as performing a t-test on data with 2 mb window-sizes. it suggests that the results are robust and not subject to change based on different window-size  <cit>  .

thus, our results revealed several interesting relationships among chromosomal interaction, histone modifications and gene regulations : 1) h3k4me <dig>  two histone acetylation marks , as well as h3k27me <dig> levels are significantly enriched upon estrogen stimulation. from literature, we knew that the former three histone marks are always enriched in active genes  <cit>  while the latter one is enriched in repressed genes  <cit> . in particular, both active and repressive marks can coexist led to the “bivalent domain” model and the regions maintain low transcription state  <cit> ; 2) h3k4me <dig> level is not affected by the change of chromosomal interactions , h3k4me <dig> is known for its involvement in enhancer activity especially in the active distal regulatory region; 3) both repressor mark h3k9me <dig> and pol-ii levels are decreased in the e2-treated condition for all four types of chromosomal interactions. these results suggest that e2-mediated switching change of chromosomal interactions may be epigenetic regulated and influence on both positive and negative gene regulation, as there is increasing h3k4me <dig> and h3k9ac levels but decreasing h3k9me <dig> levels after e2-treated in mcf <dig> cells.

characterization of e2/erα-regulated genes in high frequent and strong differential chromosomal interactions
next, we wanted to examine the genes in the top  <dig> regions with the most gain- or loss- interactions upon e <dig> treatment . there are  <dig> genes located in these regions and we thus performed go annotation on those  <dig> genes . the results are similar to the top  <dig> hot regions: go annotation shows genes are mainly involved in intracellular signaling cascade and in the intracellular receptor-mediated signaling pathway; tissue expression analysis reveals that breast  cancer disease 3rd and mammary gland carcinoma 3rd are significantly enriched, as well as breast cancer is among the most significant disease link to the regions. in particular, a protein interactions study reveals that those genes are potentially co-regulated or co-targeted by a wide range of transcription factors  such as foxo <dig>  foxo <dig>  foxj <dig>  lhx <dig>  hfh <dig>  hfh <dig>  oct and hnf <dig>  this is also true for genes that are located in the top  <dig> or  <dig> hot regions , and is consistent with previous observation in figure  <dig>  the higher the interaction frequency the higher the erα binding occupancy. surprisingly, the time-course microarray expression profiles of those  <dig> genes do not show any major changes across the  <dig> time points , except for a few genes after 20 hours of e <dig> treatment.

to further test whether large scale chromosomal reorganization affects gene expression, we compared the number of differential expressed genes in these differential interaction regions to the overall number of differential expressed genes after e <dig> treatment in mcf <dig> cells. a chi square analysis showed that regions gained or lost intra-chromosomal interactions, however inter-chromosomal interactions were no more subject to expression change than overall genes. the p values of the chi square tests were as follows: loss intra-chromosomal interaction vs. overall -- p <  <dig> ; gain intra-chromosomal interaction vs. overall -- p <  <dig> ; loss inter-chromosomal interaction vs. overall -- p =  <dig> ; and gain inter-chromosomal interaction vs. overall -- p =  <dig> . this result suggests distinct roles of inter-chromosomal interactions and intra-chromosomal interactions in gene regulation. a small portion of the gene expression was affected by chromosomal interaction changes indicating that chromatin organization is one of the many factors involved in gene regulation.

discussion
although recent advances in high throughput technologies  have been effectively applied to map transcription factors binding sites and histone modifications on the linear dna sequence, in the one-dimensional  regulatory view, these techniques are not sufficient to provide information of how gene expression is transcriptionally modulated in the three-dimensional  chromatin architecture. two recent pioneering studies  <cit>  developed a new hi-c protocol and revealed the extensive genomic interactions. however, they are limited on a single time point hi-c experiment which can only depict a static chromatin structure. by applying this new emerging technology on a breast cancer model system, before and after estrogen treatment on mcf <dig> , we comprehensively analyzed the hi-c data performed in our laboratory and revealed a dynamic chromatin re-organization upon e <dig> stimulation resulting in altered gene regulation and their associations with epigenetic modification states. our work provides further insight into the effect of chromatin interaction on e2/erα regulated downstream genes in breast cancer cells.

several studies support a notion that long-range regulation of many critical genes may be involved in both normal development and disease  <cit> . a recent study showed that genes with similar functions form a multi-gene complex through chromatin interactions and cooperatively expressed at a high level  <cit> . interestingly, by go analysis, we found that breast cancer associated genes are enriched in highly interactive regions  in mcf <dig> cells. our results indicate that the disease related genes might be co-upregulated in breast cancer cells due to the high order structure changes of the chromatin . genes in low chromosomal interaction frequency regions may not contribute to the development of cancer, but genes in high interaction frequency regions  may be essential to human disease such as breast cancer.

our study also suggests that the dynamic chromosomal interaction switches are frequently occurring in the chromosomal interaction hot regions  after e <dig> treatment. those regions contain genes not only highly associated with breast cancer but also actively participating in signaling cascade and signaling pathways. though gene expression levels are not significantly changed after e <dig> treatment at the interaction hot regions, they interact with a wide range of tfs such as foxo <dig>  thus, chromosome interaction hot regions are potentially very important to functional genome regulation because they bear active chromosome interaction upon e <dig> stimulation, and the regions may function as a harbor to recur many tfs for initiating more activities in the downstream gene regulations such as histone modifications.

CONCLUSIONS
our study is among one of the first attempts to profile genome-wide dynamic chromatin re-organization in response to environmental changes. we observed both extensive looping and de-looping events in mcf <dig> cells after e <dig> treatment, and discovered that dynamic changes of both inter- and intra-chromosomal interactions do exist with predominate inter-chromosomal changes. further, we found both active  and repressive  histone modification changes associated with interaction gain or loss. this result indicated a dual-role of chromatin structure change on transcriptional regulation, one part of the chromatin territories forms a co-activate complex while the other part of the chromatin forms a co-repressive complex. we linked the dynamic organization to major transcription factors associated with disease development, in this case estrogen receptor α, and transcriptional regulation. in addition, a strong negative correlation between interaction and nucleosome density  provided evidence of the cooperative regulation of genes. these results strongly suggest that environmental stimulation can trigger the re-organization of the chromatin, which can further impact regulation of critical genes. the elucidation of the association between chromatin interaction and critical genes may shed light on the underlying mechanisms of disease development and progression.
