BACKGROUND
neuroblast migration is a complex, integrated process that involves a coordinated sequence of cellular events, from surface receptor activation by external stimuli to transduction of these stimuli by intracellular pathways and subsequent dynamic cytoskeleton remodelling  <cit> . many signalling molecules participate in the modulation of neuronal migration, including molecules classified as neurotransmitters and as growth/differentiation factors  <cit> .

the tyrosine kinase receptor erbb <dig> binds members of the neuregulin  family of trophic and differentiation factors. receptor-ligand interaction induces the homo- or heterodimerization with other members of the erbb receptor family, which in turn results in the activation of several intracellular signalling pathways and the induction of cellular responses including migration of neuronal precursor cells  <cit> . in vivo studies demonstrate that the nrg1/erbb <dig> system is involved in tangential migration of olfactory bulb  interneuron precursors in the rostral migratory stream   <cit>  and of cortical interneuron precursors migrating from the ventral telencephalon  <cit> .

the n-methyl-d-aspartate -type glutamate receptor  is a calcium permeable channel whose functions have been mainly characterized in excitatory synapses of mature neurons. recent studies strongly suggest that glutamate may act as a paracrine signal through nmdars early expressed by neuronal precursors and immature neurons  <cit> . nmdars also appear to be involved in several modes of migration in vivo, such as radial migration of cerebellar granule cells and tangential/radial migration in the developing cortex  <cit> .

in the last twenty years, several studies have pointed to a key role of ca2+ signalling in the control of neuronal migration. evidence came first from imaging studies of granule cell migration in acute mouse cerebellar slices, in which blockade or enhancement of ca2+ influx through n-type voltage dependent calcium channels  or the nmdar reduced or promoted the rate of granule cell movement, respectively  <cit> . similarly, the involvement of calcium influx from the extracellular medium has also been reported for the migration of other cell types like gnrh- <dig> neurons, cortical projection neurons and interneurons  <cit> .

in developing and mature neurons, nmdars and the nrg1/erbb <dig> system have been found to interact in several ways. in the cerebellar cortex, nrg <dig> release by afferent fibres induces the expression of nr2c subunits during synaptogenesis through the activation of erbb <dig> receptors  <cit> ; in the rat prefrontal cortex and in neuronal primary cultures, nrg <dig> activation of erbb <dig> modulates nmdar currents and regulates trafficking and endocytosis of nmdar subunits at excitatory synapses  <cit> ; nrg <dig> signalling through fyn kinase modulates nmdar phosphorylation  <cit> ; activity-driven glutamatergic synapse development is impaired by genetic deficits in nrg1/erbb <dig> signalling  <cit> .

up to now, no studies have analyzed the interaction between these two systems in neuronal migration. the present work is a first attempt to address this issue in a simplified in vitro model of neural progenitors, the st14a cell line  <cit> , in which nrg1/erbb <dig> mediated migration has been previously characterized  <cit> . as expected from the expression data, we show that nmda induces small ca2+ signals in erbb4-transfected st14a cells. while nmda does not modify basal migration rates, it is able to increase nrg1-induced migration. we provide evidence that both nrg1- and nrg1+nmda-induced migrations are calcium-dependent processes. indeed, nrg <dig> stimulation of erbb <dig> receptors elicits long lasting increases in i, with a mechanism involving store-operated calcium entry . short-time  co-incubation of nmda and nrg <dig> is not sufficient to significantly modify the nrg1-induced calcium signals, suggesting a complex mechanism of interaction requiring either a longer time span or the generation of calcium signals confined to subcellular domains not detectable with recordings of changes in bulk cytosolic calcium concentration.

RESULTS
nmda does not modify basal migration of wild type st14a cells
nmdar expression in wild type  st14a cells
data from several groups have suggested that neural stem cells and neural progenitors may express low levels of the nmda receptor  <cit> . we tested the expression of all known nmdar subunits in wt st14a cells by rt-pcr. wt st14a cells were grown at 33°c for  <dig> hrs in 2% fbs dmem  and were harvested for rna extraction. figure 1a shows that st14a cells express the mrnas of a restricted number of nmdar subunits: nr <dig>  nr2c and nr2d. the use of splicing-specific nr <dig> primer pairs allowed us to determine that the most expressed isoform is nr <dig> a. this particular nr <dig> isoform lacks the n <dig> cassette  and has a long intracellular tail lacking the er retention signal and containing a pdz interacting motif.

nmda dose-response assay on viability of wt st14a cells
before testing the effects of nmdar stimulation on wt st14a progenitor migration, we checked whether nmda could modify the total number of cells at the concentrations employed in the subsequent migration assays. nmda at high concentrations can be cytotoxic, depending on receptor density and subunit composition  <cit> . nmda could also increase cell proliferation and/or survival, as demonstrated by several groups by in vivo and in vitro experiments  <cit> .

wt st14a cells were incubated with scalar concentrations  of nmda for  <dig> hrs , then fixed and counted. results show that nmda does not modify the total number of cells . this result suggests that, in the concentration range 1- <dig> μm, nmda has no excitotoxic effects on wt st14a cells. we consider very unlikely the occurrence of proliferative effects, due to the low-serum culture conditions  and the short incubation time  used in these experiments. compensatory effects of concurrent cell division and cell death are also very unlikely; therefore, it can be safely assumed that the 1- <dig> μm nmda concentration range is suitable for migration assays.

transwell assays on nmda-stimulated wt st14a cells
st14a cells have been generated from e <dig> striatum primordia. therefore, we can assume that they mostly derive from the lateral ganglionic eminence, a source of a large number of migrating neuronal precursors. wt st14a cell motility in un-stimulated conditions has been previously described by other laboratories  <cit> .

on this basis, we tested the hypothesis that nmda can modulate basal migration of wt st14a cells, either positively or negatively. cells were treated for  <dig> hrs with scalar concentrations of nmda in a transwell assay. results clearly show that wt st14a cells have a low basal intrinsic motility that is not altered by the presence of nmda . on the other hand, nmda could have no effect per se in st14a cell migration, and have instead an effect when added together with other molecules, such as members of the neuregulin family, and specifically nrg <dig>  that has been shown to promote erbb <dig> mediated neuronal migration  <cit> . wt st14a cells do not express erbb4; however, they express other erbb receptors, which could mediate a nrg1-induced response in the presence of nmda.

to test these hypotheses, we performed transwell assays stimulating cells either with nrg <dig> alone or in combination with  <dig> μm nmda . as expected  <cit> , nrg <dig> does not enhance migration of wt st14a, both when administered alone or in the presence of nmda.

nmda enhances nrg1-induced migration in erbb <dig> transfected-st14a cells
our laboratory has previously shown that st14a clones stably transfected with different erbb <dig> isoforms show a variable degree of increased migratory activity when stimulated by nrg <dig>  depending on the specific erbb <dig> isoform  <cit> . since there are no data in the literature comparing the interactions of different erbb <dig> isoforms with nmdars, we used the two erbb <dig> expressing clones showing the highest increase in migration following nrg <dig> stimulation. these clones express the jma/cyt <dig> erbb <dig> isoform, containing a cleavage site for the metalloprotease tace in the juxtamembrane region, and the jmb/cyt <dig> erbb <dig> isoform, that has an intracellular binding site for pi3k. the latter, however, showed a very high basal migratory activity in preliminary experiments, making it more difficult to unmask the effect of any molecule added to nrg <dig>  therefore, we chose a jma/cyt <dig> erbb <dig> expressing clone  characterized by a lower level of basal migration.

as we did for wt st14a cells, we tested the effect of scalar concentrations of nmda on the total number of cells for  <dig> hrs. again, we found that nmda, in the concentration range 1- <dig> μm, does not modify the total number of cells .

we subsequently performed transwell assays on erbb4-transfected cells stimulated with  <dig> μm nmda, or  <dig> nm nrg <dig>  or the two drugs in combination, using mock cells as a negative control . statistical analysis with two-way anova revealed significant main effects of drug treatment  and of erbb <dig> expression  and significant interaction between the  <dig> factors . posthoc comparison  showed that mock cells do not show significant changes as compared to control when stimulated with nrg <dig> alone, nmda alone, or the combination nrg1+nmda; these results are in line with those obtained with wt st14a cells . in erbb4-transfected cells, as expected, nrg <dig> induces a highly significant increment in the number of migrated cells , while nmda alone does not significantly alter basal migration . intriguingly, the combination of nmda and nrg <dig> results in a significantly higher migration rate as compared to that observed with nrg <dig> alone . the addition of the nr2c/d subunit-specific antagonists ppda  and ubp <dig>  was able to decrease the combined effects of nrg <dig> and nmda by a similar extent . the channel blocker mk- <dig>  and the competitive antagonist d-ap <dig>  were also able to reduce migration, albeit to a lesser extent . potential effects of all  <dig> nmda antagonists on cell number and viability were previously checked in a dose-response assay over an  <dig> hrs period , to make sure that the agonist concentration used in migration assays would not affect cell survival and cell proliferation.

to better characterize the nmdar subunits expressed by erbb4-transfected st14a cells and compare them to wt cells, we performed rt-pcr studies with nmdar subunit specific primers. results indicate that, as for wt st14a cells, the erbb4-transfected clone expresses nr <dig> a, nr2c and nr2d transcripts . in addition, the nr3b subunit mrna was found. generally, nmdars are composed of at least one nr <dig> subunit and variable combinations of nr2/nr <dig> subunits, generating nmda receptors differing in their functional characteristics and in cell-type and sub-cellular localization  <cit> . the two nr <dig> subunits expressed by st14a cells  are prevalently extra-synaptic and are characterized by low-conductance openings and low sensitivity to mg2+ block. nr <dig> subunits act like a dominant negative, reducing the amplitude of the response and its desensitization, and decreasing the ca2+ permeability of the nmdar channel. we also quantified the expression of nmdar subunit mrnas in mock and erbb4-transfected st14a cells stimulated with nrg <dig>  nmda and the two molecules together ; we found no evidence of regulation of nr <dig>  nr2c, nr2d and nr3b subunit expression. whether the nmdar is regulated at a different level  remains to be elucidated in future studies.

in summary, migration experiments performed with nmdar subunit-specific antagonists and expression studies together suggest that nr1/nr2c/d-containing nmdars synergistically interact with the nrg1/erbb <dig> system, ultimately producing a potentiation of st14a cell migration. a possible functional role of the nr3b subunit remains to be ascertained.

calcium is involved in nrg1-induced migration
bapta-am dose-response assay on viability of st14a cells
neurotrophins, neurotransmitters and other extracellular signalling molecules have been shown to promote neuronal motility in a calcium-dependent way  <cit> ; for this reason, we checked whether the migratory activity induced by nrg <dig>  and its further enhancement observed when nmda is added to nrg <dig>  are ca2+-dependent.

to evaluate the role of ca2+ we treated cells with bapta-am, a ca2+ chelator that can cross the membrane and, once in the cytoplasm, is cleaved by endogenous esterases thus buffering the increases in i due to extracellular influx or intracellular release from stores. just because of its pleiotropic effect, buffering intracellular ca2+ can be dangerous and can affect processes like cell adhesion to substrata or cell survival. to test the effect of bapta-am on cells, erbb4-transfected cells were incubated with scalar concentrations of bapta-am  and the number of cells after  <dig> and  <dig> hrs was evaluated . since even during the  <dig> hrs incubation the cell number was not affected by the application of bapta-am and no signs of cell detachment were evident, we chose the higher concentration  for the subsequent transwell assays.

transwell assays on nmda/nrg1-stimulated erbb4-transfected cells in the presence of bapta
transwell assays were performed on erbb4-transfected cells previously incubated with  <dig> μm bapta-am in 2% fbs-dmem for  <dig> minutes . statistical analysis with two-way anova showed significant main effects of drug treatment  and of intracellular ca2+ chelation , with significant interaction between the two factors . posthoc comparison  showed that bapta-am had no effect on migration either in control conditions  or in the presence of nmda . interestingly, bapta-am significantly decreased nrg1-induced migration  without abolishing it completely , implying that this migratory mechanism is at least in part ca2+-dependent. furthermore, in the presence of bapta-am, the nrg <dig> and nrg1+nmda conditions were not significantly different , meaning that bapta-am is able to prevent the cooperation between the pathways activated by nmda and nrg <dig> .

the addition of the nr2c/d subunit-specific antagonists ubp <dig>  did not further potentiate the inhibitory effect of bapta , suggesting that this intracellular chelator is able to buffer the ca2+ entering the cell through the nmdar.

collectively, these data suggest that intracellular bapta-am, by buffering i changes, interferes with the nrg1-induced migration and antagonizes the synergistic effect exerted by nmda on nrg <dig> 

calcium signals induced by nrg <dig> and nmda
subsequently, we investigated if nrg <dig> stimulation in erbb4-transfected cells could elicit calcium signals. as shown in figure 4a,  <dig> nm nrg <dig> caused an elevation in intracellular calcium. responding cells were 99% ; mean peak amplitude was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . in most cells, the signal was biphasic, a transient phase being followed by a long lasting plateau. when the agonist was washed out, i remained at levels higher than control for tens of minutes in most cells ; in some cells, it returned slowly to basal levels.

in order to distinguish the relative contributions of extracellular ca2+ influx and release from intracellular stores, we performed the nrg <dig> stimulation in an extracellular solution without ca2+ and with  <dig>  mm egta added. figure 4b shows that in the absence of extracellular ca2+ a lower and slowly decaying signal can be observed, implying a contribution of ca2+ released from intracellular stores .

when ca2+ was restored into the perfusion solution, after nrg <dig> had been removed from the bath, a strong increase in i was observed in 78% of cells . mean Δr was  <dig>  ±  <dig> . this effect can be ascribed to store-operated calcium entry/soce  <cit> , i.e. to the influx of extracellular ca2+ triggered by depletion of intracellular stores.

this mechanism may account, either completely or partially, for the long lasting plateau observed in  <dig> mm extracellular ca2+. to clarify this issue, we stimulated the cells with  <dig>  mm thapsigargin  and, subsequently, during the plateau phase of the response, with  <dig> nm nrg <dig>  tg induces irreversible depletion of er calcium stores and activates soce. with this protocol, nrg <dig> did not elicit any additional increase in i in  <dig> out of  <dig> cells responding to tg with a biphasic response , providing evidence that the influx activated by nrg <dig> is almost totally dependent on soce .

when nrg <dig> was applied to mock transfected cells in the presence of  <dig> mm extracellular ca2+, no response could be observed .

on the other hand, stimulation with  <dig> μm nmda led to a very slow increase in i in 46% of cells tested , reaching a value of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . more than  <dig> min were needed to reach the plateau. this result is coherent with the low nmdar expression level found in the st14a cells, and the peculiar time course of the response can be explained by the reduced mg2+ dependence of the receptors present in these cells, that can allow for the opening of some channels even at resting membrane potentials; this activation may induce a slow depolarizing response, that in turn may cause further channel openings.

the specificity of the nmda-induced i elevation was checked by employing the nr2c/d subunit-specific antagonist ubp <dig>  due to the slow time course and limited reversibility of the responses to nmda, we did not test ubp <dig> in acute protocols. rather, we preincubated the cells with the blocker ; following stimulation with  <dig> μm nmda, no response could be detected .

to test the dependence of the observed increases in i from calcium influx from the extracellular medium, cells were preincubated in a calcium-free extracellular solution and subsequently challenged with  <dig> μm nmda: no response could be observed .

we subsequently studied the effects of co-stimulation with nrg <dig> and nmda on ca2+ signalling. when nrg <dig> and nmda were applied together, percentages of responsive cells and peak values were not significantly different from those obtained with nrg <dig> alone . plateau values, too, were not significantly different between the two conditions: nrg <dig>  Δr =  <dig>  ±  <dig> , n = 227; nrg1+nmda, Δr =  <dig>  ±  <dig> , n =  <dig> 

notably, time to peaks were significantly shorter as compared with those observed with separate stimulation with either nrg <dig> or nmda ; this finding could imply that nmda exerts some form of sensitization on the pathway dependent on erbb <dig> 

when nmda was removed from the extracellular medium after the responses had already reached the plateau phase, a limited decay in the plateau could be observed .

finally, when nrg <dig> was applied during the slow response to nmda , a biphasic increase in i was observed, with a peak amplitude not significantly different  from the responses to nrg <dig> alone.

discussion
neuronal migration is a tightly regulated process in which the orchestrated activity of multiple molecules combines to bring about the appropriate allocation of post-mitotic nerve cells. previous studies have shown that the nrg1/erbb <dig> system is involved in several types of neuronal migration. on the other hand, intracellular calcium fluctuations, in many cases regulated by influx through ca2+ permeable membrane channels, play central roles in neuronal motility  <cit> ; however, little is known about the involvement of calcium signals in nrg1-induced neuronal migration. in this work, we analyzed the calcium dependence of the migratory-promoting activity of the nrg1-erbb <dig> system in immortalized neural progenitors , and the interaction between this pathway and the one dependent on the nmda-type glutamate receptor, a calcium permeable channel. using st14a cells exogenously expressing erbb <dig>  we demonstrate that the two systems synergistically act in stimulating progenitor cell migration in a ca2+-dependent manner.

st14a cells were chosen because they endogenously express all members of the erbb family  except erbb <dig>  we were able to compare migratory activity in cells lacking and expressing erbb <dig> by using wild type st14a cells and clones permanently transfected with specific erbb <dig> isoforms  <cit> . our rt-pcr studies show that erbb4-transfected cells, similarly to wild type st14a cells, express a restricted number of nmdar subunits: nr <dig> a, nr2c, nr2d and nr3b. data from the literature indicate that the nr <dig> subunit is essential for nmdar trafficking and insertion into the plasma membrane; different combinations of the nr <dig> and nr <dig> subunit families generate nmda receptors differing in their functional characteristics, and cell-type and sub-cellular localization  <cit> . the two nr <dig> subunits expressed by st14a cells  are prevalently extra-synaptic and are characterized by low-conductance openings and low sensitivity to mg2+ block  <cit> . on the other hand, nr <dig> subunits act like a dominant negative, reducing the amplitude of the response and its desensitization, and decreasing the ca2+ permeability of the nmdar channel  <cit> . since usually nmdars are composed of at least one nr <dig> subunit and variable combinations of nr2/nr <dig> subunits, the resulting nmdars would generate smaller, long lasting currents, that are less mg2+-sensitive and ca2+-permeable than those of nr2a-2b containing nmdars.

we did not find a statistically significant effect of nmda on basal migration of either wild type or erbb4-transfected st14a cells; this finding could be ascribed either to a low number of nmda receptors on the st14a cell membrane, or to their reduced ca2+ permeability, yielding a ca2+ influx not sufficient to elicit a migratory response by itself.

erbb <dig> expression is necessary for nrg1-induced migration in st14a progenitors. the mechanism has been partly characterized in our laboratory in previous studies  <cit> : erbb <dig> dimerization and tyrosine kinase trans-phosphorylation is followed by intracellular signalling cascades involving pi3k activation. when nmda was added to nrg <dig> in migration assays, we found a significant enhancement of migration compared to nrg <dig> alone . this strengthening of nrg1-stimulated migration is suggestive of a cooperation between nmda and erbb <dig> receptors in inducing and/or maintaining a migratory behaviour in st14a cells. the nmda-mediated increase in nrg1-stimulated migration could be prevented by the addition of a nr2c/d subunit-specific antagonist , strongly suggesting that the nmdars cooperating with erbb <dig> during st14a cells migration contain nr2c/d subunits.

the role of increases of the cytosolic calcium concentration in controlling cell motility has been reported in various cell types ranging from fibroblasts to immature neurons  <cit> . neuronal precursors and post-migratory neurons in the fetal cerebrum and the early postnatal cerebellum exhibit spontaneous ca2+ transients  <cit> , suggesting that the role of ca2+ transients in development may be constantly remodelled by internal programs and extracellular cues. ca2+ transients may affect the recycling of cell-adhesion receptors and induce the rearrangement of cytoskeletal components, which are essential for cell movement. the spontaneous ca2+ transients in migrating granule cells are mediated by nmda receptors and by n-type ca2+ vdccs  <cit> . other agonists that can trigger an elevation in i involved in motility control are the neurotransmitter gaba, that exerts an excitatory action in immature cells due to the high intracellular cl- concentration, the neuropeptide somatostatin that influences ca2+ fluctuations in a stage-dependent manner, and neurotrophins, like brain derived neurotrophic factor  <cit> . the erbb <dig> receptor, like other members of the erbb family  <cit> , upon ligand activation could elicit calcium release from intracellular stores and calcium influx. however, there are no data available for this mechanism in neuronal cells, apart form a report  <cit>  indicating that nrg <dig> can modulate glutamate-induced i increase. therefore, we checked if the synergism of nmdar and nrg1/erbb <dig> systems in enhancing st14a migration could be due to a modulation of ca2+ signalling.

in migration experiments carried out in the presence of the intracellular ca2+ chelator bapta-am we found a highly significant reduction both in nrg <dig> and in nmda+nrg <dig> stimulated migration, with the latter reduced to the same level seen with nrg <dig> alone. this result strongly supports the hypothesis that both nrg <dig> induced migration in st14a cells and the synergistic effect of nmdar/erbb <dig> activation involve intracellular ca2+ changes. for nrg1-induced migration, values in the presence of bapta-am were still significantly higher than controls, indicating that nrg1/erbb4-induced migration could involve also ca2+-independent mechanisms.

in the attempt to understand the mechanisms underlying these calcium-dependent effects, we began to characterize the ca2+ signalling induced by nrg <dig> and nmda by means of calcium imaging experiments. our findings indicate that nrg <dig> stimulation of erbb4-transfected st14a cells induces a long lasting increase in i, while no response could be recorded from mock transfected cells. to clarify the relative contribution and extent of calcium influx from the extracellular medium and of release from internal stores, nrg <dig> stimulation was repeated in a medium without ca2+ and containing the calcium chelator egta. cells responded to nrg <dig> with an increase in free calcium, but the signal was significantly smaller and showed a transient time course. intriguingly, after termination of nrg <dig> stimulation and subsequent reinstatement of ca2+ in the medium, the level of i was strongly increased. this finding can be explained by the activation of a store-operated calcium entry  driven by channels activated in response to depletion of the intracellular ca2+ stores . accordingly, when the mechanism was activated by emptying the intracellular stores by means of thapsigargin, cells did not respond to a subsequent stimulation with nrg <dig> 

stimulation with nmda led to an increase in free intracellular ca2+ that was significantly smaller than the one obtained with nrg <dig>  could be observed in only 46% of cells tested and was completely abolished when the cells were preincubated either in a calcium-free solution or in the presence of the nr2c/d subunit-specific nmdar antagonist ubp <dig>  significantly, these signals showed a very slow time course: more than  <dig> min were required to obtain a plateau value. this finding can be explained by a very low level of activation of nmda channels at resting potentials, compatible with the proposed reduced mg2+ sensitivity of the subunits expressed in our cells; a limited activation of these channels could induce some depolarization, thus slowly recruiting additional channels. the slow time course of activation of this mechanism, and the relatively low global increase in calcium levels could not be sufficient to promote cell motility.

when both agonists were applied simultaneously, or when nrg <dig> was presented during the slow rising phase of the nmda response, peak amplitudes were not significantly different from those obtained following stimulation with nrg <dig> alone; however, when nmda was removed during the plateau phase of the response, that can be ascribed to calcium influx, a slight reduction in i could be detected. taken together, these observations can explain the different roles of the two agonists in promoting migration of st14a cells and their calcium dependence: the slow and small increases in i elicited by nmdar activation are not sufficient to promote a significant amount of neuronal migration, while the faster, stronger and sustained signals induced by the nrg1/erbb <dig> pathway are sufficient; however, when nmda is presented together with nrg <dig>  the small additional amount of calcium entering from the extracellular medium can exert a synergistic effect, possibly by inducing calcium signals localized to cellular subdomains  that could contribute to the enhancement of cell motility.

nrg <dig> is one among several candidate genes linked to a relevant behavioural disease, schizophrenia. there are many hypotheses on the pathogenesis of this disease: some studies suggest that young-adult onset of schizophrenia may originate from disarranged circuitry caused by an altered migration of neuronal precursors during pre- and post-natal brain development  <cit> . according to post-mortem studies, in the brain of schizophrenic patients there is an altered nrg1/erbb <dig> signalling and an hypo-functional glutamatergic system. therefore, the understanding of nmdar-nrg1/erbb <dig> interactions during neural precursor migration may contribute to reveal the molecular and cellular basis of schizophrenia and of other neurodevelopmental disorders.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we present in this paper the first experimental evidence that nrg <dig>  by activating the erbb <dig> receptor, can induce long lasting increases in intracellular calcium in a line of striatal neural progenitors, and that these signals are involved in the migratory behaviour of these cells. the mechanism responsible for these signals appears to be mainly dependent on the activation of a store operated calcium influx. moreover, we suggest a role for nmda receptors in modulating nrg1/erbb4-induced migration. this interaction is calcium-dependent, even if the mechanism responsible for this cooperative effect still needs to be elucidated.
