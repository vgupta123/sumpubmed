BACKGROUND
the dandelion species taraxacum brevicorniculatum belongs to more than  <dig>  plant species that produce latex, a milky sap, in specialized parenchyma cells called laticifers  <cit> . among other secondary metabolites and proteins, laticifers contain a large variety of industrially valuable isoprenoid end products, including triterpenes such as α-amyrin, β-amyrin, lupeol and taraxasterol, and polyisoprenes such as natural rubber  <cit> . the components of the rubber transferase complex have been investigated in rubber-producing plants like the rubber tree , lettuce  and t. brevicorniculatum . labeling experiments in h. brasiliensis showed that the cytosolic mevalonate  pathway provides the precursor isopentenyl pyrophosphate  for rubber biosynthesis in the laticifers  <cit> . we therefore characterized the key enzymes of the mva pathway and upstream reactions in t. brevicorniculatum latex .fig.  <dig> proposed biosynthesis of isoprenoid products via the mva pathway with upstream reactions in t. brevicorniculatum latex. enzymes or enzyme complexes are shown in blue and multiple/dashed arrows indicate multiple enzymatic steps. acl, atp citrate lyase; aact, acetoacetyl-coa thiolase; dmapp, dimethylallyl pyrophosphate; fpp, farnesyl diphosphate; hmgr, 3-hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl-coa reductase; ipp, isopentenyl pyrophosphate; mva, mevalonate; sqe, squalene epoxidase




in several previous studies, 3-hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl-coa reductase  has been identified as the rate-limiting enzyme in the mva pathway . plant hmgrs are characterized by four domains: a variable cytosolic n-terminus, two endoplasmic reticulum transmembrane domains, a variable region between the transmembrane domains, and a cytosolic c-terminus containing the highly-conserved catalytic domain  <cit> . plant hmgrs are regulated at the post-transcriptional and post-translational levels, e.g. by phosphorylation and inhibition by their own n-terminus . t. brevicorniculatum produces three hmgrs encoded by the genes tbhmgr <dig>  tbhmgr <dig> and tbhmgr <dig>  with tbhmgr <dig> predominantly expressed in the latex  <cit> . mva pathway engineering in plants is challenging  <cit> . the overexpression of endogenous key enzymes often fails to increase the yield of end products due to negative feedback or rate-limiting downstream steps, and the regulatory mechanisms therefore need to be characterized in more detail  <cit> .

enzymes acting upstream of hmgr in the latex might act as additional rate-limiting steps for isoprenoid biosynthesis, including atp citrate lyase  and acetoacetyl-coa thiolase  . acetyl-coa is required in many anabolic and catabolic pathways in plants and must be synthesized in every cell compartment  <cit> . acl cleaves citrate into oxaloacetate and acetyl-coa in the cytosol. it belongs to the thiokinase superfamily, which also includes succinyl-coa synthetase  and citrate synthase  among others  <cit> . scs is localized in mitochondria and catalyzes the reversible conversion of succinyl-coa to succinate and coa. therefore, atp-binding and coa-binding domains are conserved between scs and acl. arabidopsis thaliana acl is a 500 kda heteromeric protein comprised of acla and aclb subunits. atacla is very similar to the β-subunit of atscs, whereas ataclb is more closely related to the α-subunit of atscs and to atcs  <cit> . transgenic a. thaliana plants expressing atacla- <dig> antisense rna have a severe dwarf phenotype which underlines the importance of this enzyme for anabolic processes  <cit> . furthermore, the overexpression of an a. thaliana atacl fusion protein in dandelion latex increased acl activity and led to the accumulation of various isoprenoid end products, highlighting its ability to increase flux through the mva pathway  <cit> . the effective shuttling of acetyl-coa into the mva pathway requires a claisen-type condensation reaction between two acetyl-coa molecules to form acetoacetyl-coa, which is catalyzed by aact. in plants, catabolic 3-ketoacyl-coa thiolases  and anabolic acetoacetyl-coa thiolases  belong to the thiolase superfamily  <cit> . the mva pathway requires type ii thiolases, and the corresponding enzymes have been characterized in a. thaliana, h. brasiliensis and medicago sativa. in a. thaliana, the ataact <dig> and ataact <dig> genes have different spatiotemporal expression profiles and knockout phenotypes: ataact <dig> t-dna knockout lines show normal growth and development whereas ataact <dig> t-dna knockout lines are embryonic lethal  <cit> . furthermore, ataact <dig> rnai lines are sterile and are characterized by a reduced cell size and cell number, indicating that ataact <dig> is essential among others for sterol biosynthesis via the mva pathway, which is pivotal for membrane biosynthesis. in h. brasiliensis, hbaact <dig> is predominantly expressed in the latex whereas hbaact <dig> and hbaact <dig> are mainly expressed in mature leaves  <cit> . in m. sativa, the key role of msaact <dig> in isoprenoid biosynthesis was shown by overexpression experiments, which resulted in higher thiolase activity and the accumulation of squalene  <cit> .

the dandelion acl and aact genes have not been characterized in detail but may play a key role in isoprenoid biosynthesis as in other plants. we therefore identified acl and aact genes predominantly expressed in t. brevicorniculatum latex and characterized their spatiotemporal expression profiles. we also overexpressed the well-characterized a. thaliana hmgr, acl and aact genes in t. brevicorniculatum to increase flux through the mva pathway predominantly in the latex. this allowed us to determine the impact of the three enzymes on the accumulation of isoprenoid end products such as triterpenes and polyisoprenes.

RESULTS
synthesis of the full-length acla, aclb and aact cdna sequences from t. brevicorniculatum latex rna
the t. brevicorniculatum genome has not yet been sequenced, so expressed sequence tag  databases at genbank prepared from either root material of its close relative t. koksaghyz or from t. officinale  were searched for acla, aclb and aact cdna sequences. two different t. koksaghyz acla ests  as well as one t. officinale acla est  were found which covered the 5′ end of acla open reading frames based on comparisons with the a. thaliana acla genes at1g <dig>  at1g <dig> and at1g <dig>  one full-length cdna sequence could be amplified by 3’race using t. brevicorniculatum root latex rna as template. the 1272-bp tbacla <dig> cdna  based on the overlapping ests dr <dig> and dr <dig> encoded a protein of  <dig> amino acids. furthermore, two different t. koksaghyz ests  were found with high similarity to the a. thaliana aclb orthologs at3g <dig> and at5g <dig>  by performing 5’race using the same template one full-length tbaclb cdna  encoding a protein of  <dig> amino acids named tbaclb <dig>  was produced. finally, t. koksaghyz ests dr <dig> and dr <dig> showed high similarity to the a. thaliana aact genes at5g <dig> and at5g <dig>  one full-length cdna was produced by 3’race again using t. brevicorniculatum root latex rna as the template. the 1227-bp tbaact <dig> cdna sequence  based on est dr <dig> encoded a protein of  <dig> amino acids.

the deduced polypeptides of full-length cdnas were aligned in silico with known acls and aacts from a. thaliana, oryza sativa and h. brasiliensis using clustal omega  . the tbacla <dig> amino acid sequence showed 79–85% identity to aclas from a. thaliana  and o. sativa . as shown in additional file  <dig> a, tbacla <dig> contains the acl-scs family signature  <dig> motif  at residues 270– <dig> as well as the residues lys <dig>  lys <dig>  glu <dig> and asp <dig>  which are conserved in the atp grasp domain  <cit> .

the tbaclb <dig> amino acid sequence showed 90–91% identity to ataclb <dig> , ataclb <dig>  and osaclb <dig> . the multiple sequence alignment suggested the presence of the above mentioned acl-scs family signature  <dig> motif at tbaclb <dig> residues 168– <dig>  as well as the acl-scs family signature  <dig> motif  at tbaclb <dig> residues 174– <dig> and the acl-scs family active site  at tbaclb <dig> residues 259– <dig>  including the his <dig> residue which is thought be phosphorylated by atp . this confirmed the homology between tbaclb <dig> and scs α-subunits.

the tbaact <dig> protein sequence showed 79% identity to hbaact <dig> , 78% identity to ataact <dig>  and 75% identity to ataact <dig> . the multiple sequence alignment indicated the presence of thiolase signature  <dig>  at tbaact <dig> residues 354– <dig>  and the thiolase active site  at tbaact <dig> residues 389– <dig>  including residues involved in the thiolase reaction cycle  <cit>  . the greater sequence identity between tbaact <dig> and ataact <dig> compared to the functionally redundant ataact <dig>  <cit>  suggests that tbaact <dig> is the dominant aact isoform in t. brevicorniculatum.

transcriptional regulation of the tbacla, tbaclb and tbaact genes
to determine whether the isolated tbacla <dig>  tbaclb <dig> and tbaact <dig> genes encoded the dominant isoforms in the latex, qrt-pcr analyses were performed using rna from the latex, root, peduncle, leaf and flower tissues of 10-week-old wild-type t. brevicorniculatum plants grown under greenhouse conditions. furthermore, qrt-pcr primer pairs were included in the analysis that were based on the additional ests mentioned above which are partial cdnas encoding a second isoform of acla, aclb and aact, named tbacla <dig> , tbaclb <dig>  and tbaact <dig> , respectively. for comparison, parallel qrt-pcr tests were carried out on the tbhmgr <dig> and tbhmgr <dig> genes, whose expression profiles have already been determined by rt-pcr  <cit> . tbhmgr <dig> plays a pivotal role in the latex mva pathway due to its expression predominantly in laticifers, whereas tbhmgr <dig> expression is barely detected in latex but it is expressed more strongly than tbhmgr <dig> in roots and leaves  <cit>  . like tbhmgr <dig>  we found that tbacla <dig>  tbaclb <dig> and tbaact <dig> were predominantly expressed in the latex . the expression of these genes detected in all other tissues may reflect the presence of small amounts of latex in all parts of the dandelion plant, but might also reflect the necessity of a basal activity of theses enzymes to synthesize important mva pathway-derived substances for regular plant development. remarkably, an overall lower expression could be measured for tbaclb <dig> and tbaact <dig> in all tissues analyzed compared to tbaclb <dig> and tbaact <dig>  respectively, whereas tbacla <dig> showed a similar expression level in roots and even slightly increased expression levels in peduncle, leaf and flower tissues  compared to tbacla <dig> indicating that tbacla <dig> is an important isoform in these tissues. however, the tissue-specific qrt-pcr analyses clearly demonstrate that tbacla <dig>  tbaclb <dig> and tbaact <dig> represent the dominant isoforms in latex and therefore appear to be highly relevant components of the t. brevicorniculatum latex mva pathway and are likely to be required for the production of isoprenoid end products in this specialized tissue.fig.  <dig> spatial and temporal acla/b and aact mrna expression profile in wild-type t. brevicorniculatum plants determined by qrt-pcr. the corresponding mrna levels were normalized against the constitutive genes elongation factor  <dig> α , glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  and ribosomal protein l <dig>  from t. brevicorniculatum. bars represent standard errors of three independent wild-type plants per line. normal distribution at p <  <dig>  was assessed using the kolmogorov-smirnov test. different letters indicate a significant difference ). a

the potential co-regulated expression of tbacla, tbaclb and tbaact during dandelion development was investigated by cultivating t. brevicorniculatum wild-type plants outside the greenhouse from march to november. total root material  was pooled from three individual plants per month and tested by qrt-pcr . in accordance to the tissue expression analysis, tbaclb <dig> and tbaact <dig> comprised higher expression levels over the whole year in the dandelion root compared to tbaclb <dig> and tbaact <dig>  respectively , whereas in case of tbacla the isoform tbacla <dig> seemed to play an important role at defined developmental stages such as in october and november . overall, tbacla, tbaclb and tbaact displayed highly similar expression patterns with expression peaks at the seedling stage in march, and also in july and november indicative of tight co-regulation, as already reported for the a. thaliana acla and aclb subunits  <cit> . given that a. thaliana acla and aclb mrna accumulates in the epidermis and trichomes of expanding leaves as well as the epidermis of growing organs  <cit> , acl gene expression seems to be associated with  plant growth, as supported by the developmental and growth defects observed in a. thaliana acl-rnai plants  <cit> . therefore, acl activity in the mva pathway may be pivotal when large quantities of isoprenoids are required, e.g. for the synthesis of membrane sterols during development. the expression peaks in early development and in the summer were coordinated with the upregulation of tbaact in march and july. this indicated that the tbacl and tbaact genes are co-regulated to ensure the shuttling of precursors into the mva pathway during these developmental stages which are characterized by rapid expansion of the total root volume and consequently also the differentiation of the specialized laticiferous cells. interestingly, tbacl and tbaact showed an additional expression peak in november, which is when dandelion plants accumulate high levels of polyisoprenes in the roots  <cit> . this might explain the highly active mva pathway in the latex and therefore the additional upregulation of tbacl for providing precursors and tbaact as the first enzymatic step in the cytosolic isoprenoid pathway.

gene expression levels do not necessarily reflect the levels of aact and hmgr enzyme activity due to downstream regulatory mechanisms such as phosphorylation, feedback inhibition and external stimuli  <cit> . therefore, the posttranscriptional regulation of key mva pathway enzymes will be an important additional aspect to address in future studies concerning the engineering of isoprenoid metabolism in dandelion latex.

overexpression of acl, aact and hmgr orthologs from a. thaliana in dandelion latex
having identified and characterized the t. brevicorniculatum latex-specific isoforms of acl and aact, we investigated the effects of overexpressing these enzymes, using the better-characterized a. thaliana orthologs to reduce the likelihood of endogenous gene inhibition. we previously reported that overexpressing the a. thaliana atp citrate lyase fusion construct atacl enhanced acl activity in t. brevicorniculatum  <cit> . therefore, a transgenic t. brevicorniculatum line expressing atacl from our previous study  <cit>  was used here and served as a control line to complete the setup. the a. thaliana genome contains two paralogous aact genes  although only ataact <dig> is ubiquitously expressed  <cit> . the ataact <dig> cdna sequence was therefore cloned from a. thaliana leaf rna and used for the stable transformation of wild-type t. brevicorniculatum plants.

hmgr catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the mva pathway, and in a. thaliana the athmgr <dig> gene is ubiquitously expressed  <cit> . the catalytic activity of plant hmgrs is inhibited by the n-terminal domain and by phosphorylation of the c-terminus, so we tested the activity of two different variants of athmgr <dig> in the heterologous n. benthamiana system. athmgrc <dig> comprises the catalytic domain including the mutated phosphorylation site at position  <dig>  and this was  <dig> -fold more active than the wild-type catalytic domain athmgrc <dig> . athmgrc <dig> was therefore used for the stable transformation of wild-type t. brevicorniculatum plants. the potential synergistic effect of atacl, ataact <dig> and athmgrc <dig> overexpression was investigated by supertransforming transgenic t. brevicorniculatum plants expressing atacl with constructs carrying ataact <dig> and athmgrc <dig>  all cdnas were driven by the rubber elongation factor  promoter to ensure preferential expression in the latex  <cit> . the constructs prepared for stable transformation are shown in fig. 3a.fig.  <dig> expression of a. thaliana acl, aact and hmgr in transgenic t. brevicorniculatum plants. a t-dna constructs for the overexpression of atacl, ataact <dig> and athmgrc <dig> in t. brevicorniculatum. nptii, kanamycin resistance gene; bar, bialaphos resistance gene; pms, mannopine synthase promoter; pref, rubber elongation factor promoter; lb, left border; rb, right border. b protein extracts from the latex of 8-week-old transgenic and wild-type  plants analyzed by sds-page and western blot  with antibodies against the ataclb subunit , ataact <dig>  and hmgr , or ponceau s staining after protein transfer . numbers on the left refer to molecular weight markers. c relative acl, aact and hmgr enzymatic activity in the latex of 8-week-old transgenic and wild-type plants. the values of the wild-type plants were set to  <dig>  bars represent standard errors of three independent transgenic plants per line. normal distribution at p <  <dig>  was assessed using the kolmogorov-smirnov test. different letters indicate a significant difference )




a set of 5– <dig> transgenic plant lines representing each transformation experiment was characterized by either rt-pcr or qrt-pcr in the t <dig> generation . we then selected one line expressing the atacl fusion construct , two lines overexpressing ataact <dig> , two lines expressing athmgrc <dig>  and two lines expressing all three enzymes  for detailed analysis in the t <dig> generation. transgene expression in the latex harvested from roots of 8-week-old plants from all seven transgenic lines was confirmed by qrt-pcr . the expression levels of the endogenous tbacla, tbaact and tbhmgr <dig> genes were also compared to wild-type plants using the same technique . no significant differences in endogenous gene expression levels were observed between wild-type plants and the transgenic lines, indicating that the overexpression of a. thaliana genes did not affect endogenous gene expression. we also measured the levels of the corresponding endogenous and heterologous proteins. latex protein extracts obtained from roots were analyzed by western blot using antibodies specific for each enzyme . the anti-aclb antibody revealed the presence of a 66 kda band corresponding to the endogenous subunit in all lines and the presence of a 120 kda band corresponding to the chimeric atacl protein solely in the transgenic lines expressing the atacl construct . likewise, the anti-ataact <dig> antibody revealed two protein bands of ~43 kda and ~41 kda, with the upper band corresponding to the endogenous tbaact protein and the lower band corresponding to the ataact <dig> protein . finally, the anti-hmgr antibody revealed one protein band of ~63 kda representing the predominant endogenous latex isoform  and another of ~45 kda representing the catalytic domain athmgrc <dig>  the latter present only in transgenic lines hmgr- <dig>  hmgr- <dig>  acl-aact-hmgr- <dig> and acl-aact-hmgr- <dig>  these data confirmed that all transgenes were expressed in the latex as anticipated and were translated into the corresponding proteins without affecting endogenous protein levels.

having confirmed the presence of the heterologous proteins and the absence of effects on endogenous proteins, we next measured the corresponding enzyme activities in latex crude protein extracts obtained from roots by determination of the conversion of citric acid to 14c–labeled acetyl-coa , the reduction of dtnb by free coa  and the conversion of hmg-coa to mevalonolactone  . acl activity was significantly higher in the three transgenic lines expressing atacl than the other lines . aact activity was slightly higher in the four transgenic lines expressing the ataact <dig> construct . finally, all four transgenic lines expressing athmgrc <dig> showed significantly higher levels of hmgr activity than the other lines . to our knowledge, this is the first report of the successful simultaneous overexpression of three functional transgenes in the latex of t. brevicorniculatum.

upregulation of the mva pathway in t. brevicorniculatum latex enhances the accumulation of squalene, sterols, pentacyclic triterpenes and cis- <dig> -isoprene
whole roots from three 12-week-old plants per line were harvested and tested for their phenotypic and metabolic characteristics. the transgenic lines showed no overt phenotypic aberrations . furthermore, there were no significant differences between the wild-type plants and transgenic lines in terms of root fresh weight or root dry weight . the overexpression of heterologous atacl, ataact <dig> and athmgrc <dig> in the latex therefore had no significant impact on the growth or development of t. brevicorniculatum. to ensure no major costs arise from this overexpression of transgenes, it would be necessary to measure the overall plant fitness by e.g. evaluating the seed production, quality and quantity.

freeze-dried roots were used for triterpene extraction and gc/ms analysis because the quantitative analysis of triterpenes in latex tissue as described in huber et al.  <cit>  was not feasible for comparative analysis of wild-type and transgenic plant lines. the quantity of triterpene precursors was considerably higher in transgenic lines hmgr- <dig>  hmgr- <dig>  acl-aact-hmgr- <dig> and acl-aact-hmgr- <dig> than the other lines . although the levels of the precursor  <dig> -oxidosqualene were only slightly  higher in the transgenic lines compared to wild-type plants, large amounts of squalene accumulated in the roots of the triple-transgenic lines . squalene accumulation was therefore investigated morphologically in cross-sections of wild-type and transgenic roots . nile red, which stains lipophilic molecules, revealed the presence of globules resembling lipid droplets in the root sections of all four transgenic lines. these globules were much more abundant in lines acl-aact-hmgr- <dig> and acl-aact-hmgr- <dig> than lines hmgr- <dig> and hmgr- <dig>  and differed from laticifers in terms of size and position. these data suggest that excess squalene produced in these four transgenic lines is stored in lipid droplets outside the laticifers. these findings are supported by the observation of similar lipid droplets in tobacco  leaves expressing full-length or truncated hbhmgr <dig>  <cit> .fig.  <dig> influence of atacl, ataact <dig> and athmgrc <dig> overexpression in dandelion latex on isoprenoid end products in 12-week-old t. brevicorniculatum roots. a quantitative analysis of triterpene precursors , sterols  and pentacyclic triterpenes  by gc/ms in freeze-dried roots of transgenic and wild-type  t. brevicorniculatum plants. bars represent standard errors of three independent transgenic plants per line. normal distribution at p <  <dig>  was assessed using the kolmogorov-smirnov test. asterisks represent significant differences relative to wild-type ). b quantitative analysis of cis- <dig> -isoprene by 1h–nmr in freeze-dried roots of transgenic and wild-type t. brevicorniculatum plants. bars represent standard errors of three independent transgenic plants per line. normal distribution at p <  <dig>  was assessed using the kolmogorov-smirnov test. asterisks represent significant differences relative to wild-type ). c dolichol composition of freeze-dried root material determined by lc/ms. a mixture of dolichols  was used as a standard. one representative result for each transgenic line and a wild-type control is shown

we also analyzed the levels of other sterols, such as campesterol, stigmasterol and sitosterol. overall, the quantity of sterols was higher in the roots of the transgenic lines than wild-type plants but the extent of sterol accumulation was dependent on the complement of transgenes. in the lines expressing acl or aact, the sterol levels were less than 2-fold higher than wild-type levels. in contrast, the sterol levels were  <dig> -fold,  <dig> -fold,  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold higher than wild-type in transgenic lines hmgr- <dig>  hmgr- <dig>  acl-aact-hmgr- <dig> and acl-aact-hmgr- <dig>  respectively. this shows that the overexpression of acl, aact and hmgr increased flux through the mva pathway in terms of ipp units directed towards sterol biosynthesis. transgenic t. brevicorniculatum lines expressing hmgr produced the highest quantity of sterols, confirming that hmgr is the pivotal rate-limiting enzyme in the mva pathway. similarly, the overexpression of hbhmgr <dig> in tobacco achieved a 6-fold increase in sterol levels  <cit>  and the seed-specific expression of a truncated hbhmgr <dig> led to a  <dig> -fold increase in seed sterol accumulation  <cit> . our novel approach involved the simultaneous expression of three enzymes involved in the mva pathway, achieving even higher sterol levels than the expression of hmgr alone.

pentacyclic triterpenes such as taraxasterol, α-amyrin, β-amyrin and lupeol are also important triterpene components of t. brevicorniculatum latex because of their potential medical applications. for example, α-amyrin from bombax malabaricum flowers is active against a range of bacteria and fungi  <cit>  whereas α-amyrin, β-amyrin and lupeol display anti-inflammatory activities in mice and mammalian cell lines . taraxasterol has anti-allergic, anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic effects . these compounds are therefore valuable products in the biotechnology industry and efforts have already been undertaken to increase their yields, e.g. the addition of abiotic elicitors to root callus suspension cultures of t. officinale, a close relative of t. brevicorniculatum, to increase the production of taraxasterol  <cit> . in our transgenic lines overexpressing a single enzyme, the pentacyclic triterpene content increased by  <dig> – <dig> -fold compared to wild-type plants. in the triple-transgenic lines acl-aact-hmgr- <dig> and acl-aact-hmgr- <dig>  the corresponding increase was  <dig> – <dig> -fold, suggesting that the overexpression of three mva pathway enzymes has a synergistic effect. such effects could therefore enhance the industrial production of pentacyclic triterpenes, especially in combination with the metabolic engineering of downstream pathways.

next, we set out to determine the total cis- <dig> -isoprene content in t. brevicorniculatum roots by 1h–nmr spectroscopy, which includes the analysis of polyisoprenes such as dolichols as well as high-molecular-weight long-chain poly that form the main constituent of natural rubber . all transgenic lines accumulated similar or slightly higher levels of cis- <dig> -isoprene compared to wild-type plants, with lines acl- <dig>  acl-aact-hmgr- <dig> and acl-aact-hmgr- <dig> producing the highest levels . in these transgenic lines, ipp generated by the increase in flux through the mva pathway was at least in part incorporated into cis- <dig> -isoprene end products. we also investigated whether the greater abundance of precursors affected the chain length of known dolichols by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry . however, no substantial differences in dolichol composition were observed between the wild-type and transgenic lines .

the synthesis of polyisoprenes in the transgenic lines was not substantially affected by the overexpression of three key mva pathway enzymes, which may reflect the bottleneck at the squalene epoxidase step. this step is therefore ideal for more detailed characterization in future experiments. furthermore, the production of natural rubber in laticifers might not be dependent solely on the availability of ipp units, but also on the presence and activity of the enzymes that are directly linked to the rubber particles and thus build the rubber transferase complex  <cit> . these specialized end-product enzymes also represent useful targets for future genetic engineering approaches to increase the production of isoprenoid end products.

CONCLUSIONS
we isolated full-length acl and aact cdnas that are involved in production of isoprenoids in t. brevicorniculatum latex, namely tbacla, tbaclb and tbaact. the expression of the corresponding a. thaliana genes in t. brevicorniculatum latex, in addition to a derepressed version of hmgr  increased the activity of all three enzymes and affected the accumulation of isoprenoid end products. the heterologous overexpression of all three enzymes resulted in the accumulation of large amounts of squalene as well as higher levels of sterols, pentacyclic triterpenes and cis- <dig> -isoprene in the roots of the transgenic lines. the synergistic effect of the three key enzymes could facilitate the industrial production of squalene or triterpenes. the yield could be improved substantially, especially in combination with the metabolic engineering of downstream enzymes.
