BACKGROUND
iron has an essential function in mammalian metabolism because of the ease with which it can gain and lose electrons. it is involved in biological functions as a metal cofactor for many proteins and enzymes that are used in oxygen transport , electron transfer , and dna synthesis . thus, iron is indispensable for eukaryotes and prokaryotes; however, it is also potentially toxic because of the generation of the superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical. these oxygen metabolites readily react with biological molecules, including proteins, lipids, and dna. iron overload diseases owing to genetic misregulation of iron uptake are referred to as primary iron overload disease or hereditary hemochromatosis  <cit> . on the other hand, an acquired anemia that is associated with iron deficiency is referred to as anemia of inflammation or anemia of chronic disease  <cit> . organisms have a system to maintain normal iron homeostasis; iron deficiency and overload are associated with cellular dysfunction. therefore, all mammalian species tightly regulate the iron concentration in body fluids. because humans lack a regulated pathway for iron excretion, regulation of iron absorption from the intestine and the recycling of iron from senescent red blood cells  are crucial in maintaining iron balance. normal iron loss in humans occurs through exfoliation of enterocytes and skin cells, and through menstruation and childbirth. the absorption of dietary iron, composed mostly of heme and non-heme iron, occurs predominantly in the duodenum and upper jejunum, and is highly regulated  <cit> ; this involves transport of absorptive enterocytes across the apical membrane into the cytosol and across the basolateral membrane into body fluids. divalent metal transporter  <dig>  is the only known intestinal iron importer and is a member of the natural resistance-associated macrophage protein family  <cit> . dmt <dig> is highly conserved from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, expressed in the apical membrane of absorptive enterocytes in the small intestine, and is also present in the endosomes of all human cells  <cit> . proper endosomal recycling of dmt <dig> is important for efficient uptake of iron and depends on a retromer-mediated sorting mechanism  <cit> . iron imported by dmt <dig> enters into the cytosol of the absorptive cells where it can be stored in the cytosolic iron-storage molecule ferritin or exported into body fluids through the basolateral iron exporter ferroportin  <dig>   <cit> . fpn <dig>  the only known cellular iron exporter, is found on all cell types, including the duodenal mucosa, macrophage, and placenta. the bactericidal peptide hepcidin functions as an iron regulatory hormone  <cit> . the hepcidin gene encodes an 84-amino-acid pre-pro-peptide that is cleaved to form a bioactive 25-amino-acid peptide found in the plasma and urine. hepcidin is synthesized in the liver, and its gene expression is increased by iron overload and inflammation, especially interleukin  <dig> and interleukin  <dig>  <cit> , and decreased by hypoxia and anemia  <cit> . hepcidin induces irreversible internalization of fpn <dig> through lysosomal degradation, which results in a depletion of plasma iron and an accumulation of iron in duodenal enterocytes and macrophages  <cit> .

humans are able to utilize  <dig> types of iron, heme and non-heme. heme is an important nutritional source of iron and is believed to be more readily absorbed than non-heme iron. heme is a ubiquitous molecule with an active iron center carrying a high affinity to oxygen, which allows for reversible binding and transport of oxygen in hemoglobin. heme groups serve as the catalytic site; they tightly bind to a variety of proteins involved in aerobic metabolism, including respiratory chain cytochromes and numerous cytochrome p <dig> isoenzymes. heme is mostly absorbed in the proximal half of the duodenum, the absorptive capacity of which is decreased in the distal position of the small intestine  <cit> . in macrophage, senescent rbcs are phagocytosed and digested into heme in the lysosome. heme degradation is catalyzed by heme oxygenases , the activities of which are particularly high in the spleen, testes, brain, and liver  <cit> . at present, cdnas encoding  <dig> isoenzymes, ho- <dig>  <cit>  and ho- <dig>  <cit> , have been cloned. although ho- <dig> and ho- <dig> catalyze the same reaction and have similar cofactor requirements   <cit> , they substantially differ in regulation and expression patterns. ho- <dig> and ho- <dig> proteins differ in molecular weight. ho- <dig> is an inducible isoenzyme, while ho- <dig> is constitutive. ho- <dig> has been identified as the major 32-kda heat shock protein hsp <dig>  <cit>  and is highly sensitive to various stimuli, including oxidative stress, heavy metals, uv radiation, and inflammation. several reports investigated ho localization to various subcellular compartments, including endoplasmic reticulum   <cit> , nucleus  <cit> , mitochondria  <cit> , or caveola  <cit> . ho- <dig> has also been reported to change its location under hemin treatment  <cit> .

because the catalytic sites of hos are supposed to be in the cytosol, heme needs appropriate transporters for its import into the cytosol through the plasma or endosomal membrane. two heme transporters have thus far been reported--heme carrier protein  <dig>   <cit>  and heme responsive gene- <dig>   <cit> . hcp <dig> is highly conserved and is a member of a large family of proton-coupled transporters known as the major facilitator superfamily. within this family, hcp <dig> well resembles a bacterial protein that transports the antibiotic tetracycline  <cit> . notably, there are structural similarities between the planar heme ring and tetracycline-metal structures that must be transported across the apical membrane of absorptive enterocytes. moreover, hcp <dig> has recently been identified as a transporter that mediates the translocation of folate across the plasma membrane and is suggested to be the possible molecular entity of the carrier-mediated intestinal folate transport system  <cit> . hrg- <dig> and hrg- <dig> have been reported to be essential in heme homeostasis and heme sensing in caenorhabditis elegans, and hrg- <dig> knockdown leads to profound defects in erythropoiesis in zebrafish  <cit> . hcp <dig> was found to be expressed in the duodenum and small intestine  <cit> , and hrg- <dig> in the brain, heart, kidney, and small intestine  <cit> . the expression of hcp <dig> and hrg- <dig> was also investigated in some cultured cell lines and detected in macrophage and epithelial cell lines. it is not clear yet which transporter predominantly functions as the heme transporter in enterocytes or macrophages, both of which are main iron-regulatory cells in the human body.

to understand heme catabolism in humans, it is important to analyze the relationship among heme transporters, hos, and iron transporters. in the current study, we investigate the expression and subcellular localization of hos, dmt <dig>  hrg- <dig>  and hcp <dig> in non-polarized and polarized epithelial cells. our results suggest that hcp <dig> functions on the apical membrane of enterocytes, hrg- <dig> transports heme from the inside of the lysosome into the macrophages, and hos on smooth er catalyze the degradation of heme in the cytosol.

RESULTS
hos are localized to smooth er
four types of ho- <dig> and ho- <dig> constructs were constructed to examine the effect of the tagging molecule, gfp or ha, on the localization of hos . ho localization was not affected by the addition of either of these two tags on either the n or c terminus. ho- <dig> and ho- <dig> are completely colocalized with each other . thus, we used hos with a suitable tag for each experiment throughout this study. previous reports show that ho- <dig> is localized to the endosome or caveola. we compared the localization of ho- <dig> with some endosome markers or caveola. gfp-tagged ho- <dig> was not colocalized with tfr , lamp <dig> , eea <dig> , or caveolin . gfp-tagged ho- <dig> was cotransfected with mcherry-tagged nadph-cytochrome p <dig> reductase  <cit>  or mcherry-tagged syntaxin  <dig>  <cit>  . cells were additionally immunostained with anti-calnexin or anti-pdi mab. nadph-cytochrome p <dig> reductase is a donor protein that gives an electron to hos. nadph-cytochrome p <dig> reductase is speculated to be located in smooth er  <cit> . syntaxin  <dig> and calnexin are located in both rough and smooth er  <cit> . pdi catalyses disulfide interchange between thiols and protein dilsulfides, and has the highly conserved er retention sequence lys-asp-glu-leu  in its c terminus  <cit> . gfp-tagged ho- <dig> completely colocalized with nadph-cytochrome p <dig> reductase  and partly colocalized with syntaxin  <dig>  and calnexin . on the other hand, gfp-tagged ho- <dig> showed distinct localization from that of pdi, which is located in rough er . to separate rough and smooth microsomes, subcellular fractionation was performed with a 2-layered sucrose gradient using hep- <dig> cells stably expressing ha-tagged ho- <dig>  in the rough microsomal fraction, we did not observe ho- <dig> but observed both calnexin and pdi . in the smooth microsomal fraction, mainly ho- <dig> and calnexin were detected . these data strongly support the results obtained by immunofluorescence microscopic analysis. hence, it is assumed that hos are located on the smooth er membrane and not on the rough er membrane.

ho- <dig> does not change its location under hemin treatment
ho- <dig> is highly inducible by hemin and is thought to inhibit inflammation and protect against oxidative damage  <cit> . before the examination of ho localization under hemin treatment, hemin was confirmed to induce gene expression of endogenous ho- <dig> in hep- <dig> cells . previous reports show that under hemin treatment, ho- <dig> was cut off from its c-terminal transmembrane region and then relocated to the nucleus  <cit>  or mitochondria  <cit> . if the protease that cuts off the c-terminal half of ho- <dig> is induced by hemin, both endogenous and transfected ho- <dig> should be modified by this protease, and the change of localization should be observed in both ho- <dig> molecules. endogenous ho- <dig> molecule could not be detected without hemin induction  and it was impossible to compare the localization of endogenous ho- <dig> with or without hemin treatment. then, we analyzed the possible change of ho- <dig> localization by using recombinant ho- <dig> molecule. n-terminally gfp-tagged ho- <dig> was transfected into hep- <dig> cells, and then cells were cultured with  <dig> μm hemin for  <dig> h. transfected gfp-tagged ho- <dig> did not change its location to the nucleus or mitochondria ; this suggests that the localization of the n-terminal half of ho- <dig> is not affected by hemin. because it can be presumed that under hemin treatment, the c-terminal half of ho- <dig> changes its location to the nucleus or mitochondria after being cut off by the protease, we investigated whether c-terminally ha-tagged ho- <dig> could change its location under hemin treatment. n-terminally gfp-tagged ho- <dig> and c-terminally ha-tagged ho- <dig> were cotransfected and their localizations under hemin treatment were analyzed. n-terminally tagged ho- <dig> and c-terminally tagged ho- <dig> still completely colocalized with each other . therefore, these results indicate that the localization of ho- <dig> does not switch from er to the nucleus or mitochondria under hemin treatment.

hrg- <dig> and hcp <dig> are localized to the plasma membrane and lysosome
two heme transporter candidates have recently been reported: hcp <dig> and hrg- <dig>  we analyzed their subcellular localizations. hrg- <dig> was localized to the plasma membrane and partly colocalized with tfr  and lamp <dig> . hrg- <dig> has been reported to be trafficked from the endosome to the plasma membrane when the cells were cultured under serum-starvation conditions  <cit> . we examined hrg- <dig> translocation using hep- <dig> and mdck cells stably expressing gfp-tagged hrg- <dig> under serum starvation. in  <dig> h  or  <dig> h  under serum starvation, we observed hrg- <dig> both in the cytosolic organelles and plasma membrane. hrg- <dig> translocation was not observed under these conditions. hcp <dig> was localized to the plasma membrane and partly colocalized with lamp <dig>  but not with tfr . these results suggest that both hrg- <dig> and hcp <dig> are located in the plasma and lysosomal membranes in hep- <dig> cells.

subcellular localizations of  <dig> isoforms of the iron transporter dmt1
dmt <dig> has  <dig> isoforms. the differences in their n-terminal regions are produced by  <dig> different promoters , whereas those in their c-terminal regions are produced by alternative splicing   <cit> . each of the dmt <dig> isoforms has been reported to be expressed in specific tissues or cells  <cit> . thus, each dmt <dig> isoform was transfected into hep- <dig> cells and compared with several organelle markers. as shown in figure.  <dig>  dmt1a-i was mainly localized in the plasma membrane and partly colocalized with lamp <dig> but not with tfr , whereas dmt1a-ii colocalized with tfr . the localizations of the dmt1b-i and dmt1b-ii isoforms were previously reported  <cit>  . these results show that the c-terminal region conducts the subcellular localization of dmt1a as in the case of dmt1b, and the addition non-ire  c-terminal cytosolic domain leads dmt1a and dmt1b to the recycling endosome. these data are summarized in figure. 4c. the main locations of each dmt <dig> isoform are as follows: dmt1a-i, plasma membrane; dmt1a-ii, recycling endosome; dmt1b-i, late endosome and lysosome; dmt1b-ii, recycling endosome.

16leu at the n-terminal cytosolic domain is a crucial signal for dmt1a-i plasma membrane localization
to identify the structural requirements for the plasma membrane localization signal of dmt1a-i, we performed a detailed mutational analysis of the n-terminal cytosolic domain sequence. we constructed various mutants of dmt1a-i, which had deletions or amino acid substitutions within the 29-amino-acid sequence specific for dmt1a . deletion analyses showed that the his13-ser <dig> region contains the crucial region for dmt1a-i localization to the plasma membrane. then, we performed alanine scanning to investigate which amino acid in this region is crucial for dmt1a-i localization. notably, the l16a mutant displayed a severe mislocalization of dmt1a-i to late endosome and lysosome . then, we constructed mdck cells stably expressing gfp-tagged dmt1a-i, gfp-tagged dmt1b-i, or gfp-tagged dmt1a-il16a to investigate the localization in polarized cells. we observed that dmt1a-i was localized to the apical membrane and dmt1b-i to the cytosolic organelle. dmt1a-il16a was not localized to the apical membrane but was in the cytosolic organelle, as was observed in dmt1b-i.

hrg- <dig> localization is distinct from that of hcp <dig> or dmt1a-i in polarized cells
gfp-tagged hrg- <dig> and mcherry-tagged hcp <dig> showed very similar localizations in hep- <dig> cells ; we also examined hrg- <dig>  hcp <dig>  and dmt1a-i localizations in polarized mdck cells . gfp-tagged hrg- <dig> and mcherry-tagged hcp <dig> were cotransfected in hep- <dig> cells. hrg- <dig> colocalized with hcp <dig> in the plasma membrane and partly in the cytosolic organelle of non-polarized hep- <dig> cells . hrg- <dig> showed much more cytosolic accumulation, and hcp <dig> showed thick accumulation in the plasma membrane . then, we constructed mdck cells stably expressing gfp-tagged hrg- <dig> and mcherry-tagged hcp <dig> or mcherry-tagged dmt1a-i to investigate the localization of hrg- <dig>  hcp <dig>  and dmt1a-i in polarized mdck cells. hrg- <dig> was detected in the basolateral membrane and in the cytosolic organelle just under the apical membrane . on the other hand, hcp <dig>  and dmt1a-i  were mainly localized to the apical membrane. figure  <dig> shows that this cytosolic organelle is assumed to be late endosome and lysosome. to confirm our immunofluorescence assay, the cell surface proteins of these mdck cells were labeled with biotin, lysed, solubilized, and immunoprecipitated with an anti-gfp or anti-mcherry antibody. cell surface gfp-tagged hrg- <dig> was mostly detected in the fraction that contains biotinylated basolateral membrane . on the other hand, cell surface mcherry-tagged hcp <dig> and mcherry-tagged dmt1a-i were mostly detected in the fraction that contains biotinylated apical membrane. these results suggest that hrg- <dig> might transport heme through the lysosomal or the basolateral membrane, and it may not contribute to heme absorption from the diet through the apical membrane in polarized cells. therefore, these candidates may play different roles in absorptive epithelial cells.

discussion
in this study, we showed the precise subcellular localizations of hos. previous reports on ho localizations indicated that hos are located in the er  <cit> , nucleus  <cit> , mitochondria  <cit> , or caveola  <cit> . to understand heme catabolism and iron recycling in cells, it is important to determine the localizations of hos and other molecules related to heme and iron metabolism. heme is a prosthetic group that consists of a protoporphyrin ring and an iron atom. because the cell membrane is not freely permeable to heme, it is necessary to allocate certain heme transporters at appropriate locations and orientations in the cells so hos can adequately access their substrates. we constructed recombinant hos with  <dig> different types of tagging molecules on their n or c termini to examine their exact localizations in cells. before comparing their localizations with appropriate marker molecules, it is necessary to make sure that the addition of tagging molecules has no effect on ho localizations. our results show that ho- <dig> and ho- <dig> clearly colocalized with each other without any influence from the tagging molecules.

both ho- <dig> and ho- <dig> did not colocalize with pdi , which is mainly located in the rough er, but partly colocalized with syntaxin  <dig> and calnexin , both of which are located in smooth and rough er  <cit> . nadph-cytochrome p <dig> reductase, which supplies an electron to hos and is reported to be located in smooth er  <cit> , showed a clear colocalization with hos . subcellular fractionation study confirmed the specific location of hos in smooth er, as obtained by immunofluorescence analyses . ho localizations are discussed in previous reports, and this study shows that ho- <dig> does not change its location even under hemin treatment.

humans incorporate two-thirds of the total absorbed iron as heme in enterocytes and recycles iron from senescent rbcs in macrophages. two candidate molecules are thus far reported as heme transporters  <cit> : hcp <dig>  which is believed to transport heme  <cit>  or folate  <cit>  through the plasma membrane, and hrg- <dig>  which was identified in c. elegans by genome-wide microarrays as a heme-regulated gene. hrg- <dig> is also proven to be an essential molecule for erythropoiesis and development in zebrafish, and has a heme-uptake activity in human cultured cells and xenopus laevis oocytes  <cit> . to investigate on which organelles these  <dig> molecules function, we analyzed the localizations of hrg- <dig> and hcp <dig> in non-polarized epithelial cells. both hrg- <dig> and hcp <dig> are cotransfected in mdck cells, and we observed these  <dig> molecules to be localized to the plasma membrane and lysosome. hrg- <dig> is located almost equally in the plasma membrane and lysosome, whereas hcp <dig> is located mostly in the plasma membrane and slightly in the lysosome. a previous report on hrg- <dig> localization showed that hrg- <dig> is distributed in an intracellular compartment punctuated throughout the cytoplasm, with about 10% of total hrg- <dig> on the cell periphery  <cit> , and another reported that hrg- <dig> is localized to the endosome and plasma membrane  <cit> . in addition, the location of hrg- <dig> was changed under serum-starvation conditions  <cit> . in our study, hrg- <dig> is localized to both the lysosome and plasma membrane, and we did not observe hrg- <dig> translocation under serum-starvation conditions. these differences possibly arise from the differences in the cell lines or in the expression constructs used. both hrg- <dig> and dmt <dig> are localized to lysosome, and a more detailed analysis using endogenous hrg- <dig> and dmt <dig> will be needed in future works. dmt <dig>  which functions as a non-heme iron transporter, has  <dig> isoforms  <cit> . alternative splicing of the dmt <dig> gene produces  <dig> distinct classes of dmt <dig> transcripts, which differ in the c-terminal amino acids and subsequent 3'-untranslated regions. one form, ire  , has an iron responsive element  by which intracellular iron concentration can affect its translation; the other form, non-ire , does not have ire on its mrna. alternative use of dmt <dig> gene promoters generates  <dig> variant dmt <dig> transcripts that differ in nucleotide sequences encoding the 5'-untranslated region and their subsequent n-terminal amino acids. a polypeptide transcribed from the 5'-upstream promoter and exon 1a is indicated as 1a, and a polypeptide transcribed from another promoter and exon 1b is indicated as 1b in figure. 4a. these  <dig> dmt <dig> isoforms showed distinct subcellular localizations. dmt1a-i is mainly located in the plasma membrane, dmt1b-i in late endosome and lysosome, and both dmt1a-ii and dmt1b-ii in the recycling endosome. the protein expression levels of these  <dig> isoforms differ among tissue types; dmt1a-i is expressed in the duodenum and kidney and absorbs non-heme iron into the cytosol, whereas dmt1b-i is expressed in the macrophage and transports non-heme iron from the lysosome into the cytosol. dmt1a-ii is expressed in the duodenum; its expression level is considerably lower compared with other isoforms. dmt1b-ii is expressed in peripheral tissues and transports iron released from transferrin in the recycling endosome  <cit> . notably, we investigated the crucial signal for dmt1a-i localization to the plasma membrane. dmt1a-i l16a mutant localizes to the late endosome and lysosome. we reported that the non-ire  c-terminal cytosolic region conducts the proper endosomal recycling of dmt1a and dmt1b  <cit> . as a next step, analysis of the detailed function of n-terminal cytosolic region in the sorting mechanism of dmt1a is needed.

we compared the localization of hrg- <dig> with that of hcp <dig> in epithelial cells: hrg- <dig> colocalized with hcp <dig> in the plasma membrane in non-polarized epithelial cells. on the other hand, hrg- <dig> and hcp <dig> show different localizations in polarized epithelial cells; hcp <dig> is located in the apical membrane and hrg- <dig> is in the basolateral membrane and lysosome. hrg- <dig> can be detected very slightly in apical membrane in this system, and we will examine in the next stage whether endogenous hrg- <dig> is localized in apical membrane and can function to uptake heme from diet. hcp <dig> is able to transport folate more efficiently than heme  <cit> . hcp <dig> has a higher affinity for folate  than heme , and thus folate may be the more physiologically relevant target of hcp <dig>  however, our localization study indicates that hrg- <dig> cannot function as a heme transporter to absorb heme from diet because of its location in epithelial cells, and that hcp <dig> may play a role in dietary heme uptake, because heme concentration in meat is roughly estimated to be  <dig> -  <dig> μm  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we summarize a putative heme transport and iron recycling pathway in figure.  <dig>  in non-polarized cells , both hrg- <dig> and hcp <dig> are located in the plasma membrane and can mediate heme uptake from body fluids. hrg- <dig> is located in the lysosome and can transport heme from the inside of the lysosome. "professional" phagocytic cells such as macrophages are one of the most important non-polarized cells that can scavenge senescent rbcs and the hemopexin-heme and haptoglobin-hemoglobin complexes from the bloodstream. we therefore propose that there are  <dig> putative heme uptake pathways present in the macrophage: one is direct uptake of heme from body fluids to the cytosol via hrg- <dig> or hcp <dig> on the plasma membrane, and the other is through the lysosomal membrane. in the latter pathway, lysosomal heme is derived from the heme complexes that are endocytosed by the cd <dig> hemopexin-heme  <cit>  or lrp1/cd <dig> haptoglobin-hemoglobin  <cit>  receptors, and the senescent rbcs that are phagocytosed and digested in the lysosome. lysosomal heme is transported through hrg- <dig> into the cytosol. once heme is incorporated into the cytosol, it can be degraded by the aid of hos localized just at the cytosolic side of smooth er. released iron from heme is excreted into body fluids via fpn <dig> and reutilized as cofactors for many enzymes and proteins, such as hemoglobin and mitochondrial cytochrome. in polarized cells , hcp <dig> and dmt1a-i are localized to the apical membrane, and absorb heme and non-heme iron from diets, respectively. hrg- <dig> is located in the basolateral membrane and transport heme from body fluids into the enterocyte. the significance of this molecule as a heme transporter in enterocytes is not clear thus far.

in this study, we analyze the localizations of hos, hrg- <dig>  hcp <dig>  and dmt <dig> in non-polarized and polarized cells, and add new knowledge concerning heme transport and iron recycling system. future work will be needed to further define the functions of hrg- <dig> and hcp <dig> in enterocytes and macrophages, the significance of hrg- <dig> localization to the basolateral membrane in enterocytes, the capability of hrg- <dig> to transport heme from body fluids or lysosome in macrophages, and the capability of hcp <dig> to transport heme from diet.
