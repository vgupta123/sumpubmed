BACKGROUND
according to global cancer statistics, throughout world, cases of colorectal carcinoma  switched to  <dig>  million with more than  <dig> deaths per year
 <cit> . in females, crc is the second leading commonly diagnosed and third highly mortal cancer whereas in case of males, it is the third most commonly diagnosed and fourth most common cause of mortality. promotion from normal colonic epithelial cells into a colorectal carcinoma is a multifactorial process. there are many factors like cell proliferation, inflammation, migration and angiogenesis which play an important role in crc development and progression
 <cit> . conventional combination chemotherapy regimens involving folfox , folfori , ifl  and xelox  for the treatment of colorectal cancer
 <cit>  have limited efficacy and are associated with significant toxicity.

colorectal cancer represents a life-threatening complication of inflammatory bowel diseases where nfκb is a natural suspect in providing a mechanistic link between inflammation and carcinogenesis. presently, it is believed that increasing knowledge on genetic control of cellular proliferation, migration and modulation of key proteins like nfκb that are aberrant in colorectal cancer have the potential to provide an effective and improved approach for its management
 <cit> . the molecular mechanisms underlying this process have only recently started to be clarified with biochemical and genetic studies
 <cit> . nfκb is a key inflammatory mediator involved in initiation, progression and metastasis of crc
 <cit> . a variety of carcinogens and tumor promoters have shown to activate nfκb. constitutive expression of nfκb is frequently found in tumor cells and is constitutively activated in a number of human cancers via pi3k signaling
 <cit> . furthermore, nfκb activation is regulated by caspase- <dig> which cleaves iκbα, generating a cleavage fragment that potentially acts as a constitutive inhibitor of nfκb
 <cit> . on the contrary, down regulation of nfκb has been reported to be implicated in the hct- <dig> apoptotic cell death
 <cit> . in vitro treatment of hct- <dig> cell lines with nvp-bez <dig>  a dual pan-class i pi3k and mtor kinase inhibitor in clinical trials has shown decrease in cell viability and ex-vivo analysis of tumors demonstrated a 56% decreased proliferation in crc
 <cit> .

adhatoda vasica nees , commonly known as vasaka or arusha is a well known herb in indigenous system of medicine for its beneficial effects. vasicinone obtained from leaves of adhatoda vasica nees has been reported for moderate degree of bronchodilator and anti-cancer activity. in previous study, it has been shown that rlx, a vasicinone analogue has varied medicinal properties
 <cit> . here, we report for the first time that rlx has potent anti-cancer property against colon cancer hct- <dig> cells. under the tested experimental conditions, we established a differential anti-cancer effect of rlx in comparison with bez- <dig>  the results demonstrated that rlx inhibits cell proliferation, decreases nfκb and increases caspase- <dig> expression, suppresses cell migration, causes cell membrane blebbing followed by nuclear condensation of colon cancer cell and culminate apoptosis in hct- <dig> cells. these findings revealed the importance of rlx as an anti-cancer agent in treatment of colon carcinoma.

RESULTS
in vitro screening of vasicinone analogues and bez- <dig> improves growth inhibitory effect in various human cancer cell line
we evaluated inhibitory efficacy in-vitro mtt viability assay against panel of cancer cell lines and relative ic <dig> for 48 h. initially, we screened vasicinone analogue at indicated concentrations , bez- <dig>  and 5-flurouracil   against leukemia , prostate , breast , pancreatic , colon  cancer cell lines and normal epithelial cells  for 48 h. among molecules tested, rlx  showed concentration dependent inhibitory effect on cell proliferation against thp- <dig>  t47d, miapaca  <dig>  mcf- <dig> and hct- <dig> cancer cell lines and most potent inhibition against hct- <dig> whereas no significant effect on cell viability was observed in cells treated with other analogues at same concentrations. the mtt assay result revealed that hct- <dig> cells treated with rlx induced growth inhibition of the order of 96%, 82% and 79% at a concentration of  <dig>   <dig> and 20 μm . however, bez- <dig>  at 10nm showed only 50%, 53% and 51% growth inhibition against t47d, miapaca- <dig> and hct- <dig> whereas 5-fu  a known anticancer agent against colon cancer, showed 56% growth inhibition against hct- <dig> with cytotoxicity against normal epithelial cells . furthermore, ic <dig> value of rlx was calculated against panel of cell lines which was found least against hct- <dig> cells  . moreover, rlx showed growth inhibition of 23%, 14%, 12%, 8% and 3% at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 5 μm against fr- <dig> , indicated that it requires six to eight time’s higher concentration of rlx to induce 50% cell death in normal epithelial  cell line. interestingly, these results depicted that rlx showed high efficiency against hct- <dig> as reflected by its relative ic <dig> values and no cytotoxicity against fr- <dig> cells.

effect of rlx treatment on nfκb and caspase- <dig> protein expression in hct- <dig> cell line
we next examined the effect of rlx on nfκb and caspase- <dig> protein expression levels by western blotting. following rlx  treatment for 48 h, western blot analysis revealed that rlx decreased  <dig> to  <dig>  fold expression level of nfκb   and increased  <dig> to  <dig> fold caspase- <dig> expression level . however, significant effect on expression of nfκb protein was observed at  <dig> and 30 μm  and caspase- <dig> at  <dig>   <dig> and 30 μm  rlx concentration as compared to untreated and bez- <dig>  thereby suggesting nfκb down-regulation and caspase- <dig> up-regulation by rlx action.

exposure of rlx inhibits cell migration of hct- <dig> cell monolayers
cell migration experiment was performed to confirm the inhibitory effect of rlx in hct- <dig> cells. as shown in figure 
3a, rlx treatment at  <dig>   <dig> and 30 μm showed hct- <dig> cell migration inhibition when compared to untreated  and bez- <dig> . however, at increased concentrations of rlx , hct- <dig> cells showed significant cell migration inhibition in a concentration dependent manner as compared to untreated control .

rlx treatment culminate microvilli loss in hct- <dig> cells
as exhibited in figure 
4a, untreated cells were having intact microvilli all over the surface. however, rlx treatment at  <dig>   <dig> and 30 μm resulted in blebbing of the plasma membrane and loss of microvilli. interestingly, most significant smoothening of the cell surface, shrinkage of size and blebbing of the plasma membrane and apoptotic body formation were observed at 30 μm concentration of rlx when compared with untreated and bez- <dig>  overall, sem data clearly demonstrated typical early apoptotic phenomena and loss of microvilli as compared to untreated control.

nuclear condensation in rlx treated hct- <dig> cells
we next examined the morphological insights caused by rlx in hct- <dig> cells using diamidine phenyl indoledihrdrochloride  staining. uniformly spherical hct- <dig> cell with normal morphology was observed in untreated cultures, whereas chromatin condensation and chromosomal dna cleavage were observed when hct- <dig> cells were treated with rlx  and bez- <dig> . as shown in figure 
4b, with increase in concentration  of rlx there is increase in nuclear condensation and formation of apoptotic vesicles. however, prominent effect was seen at a concentration of  <dig> and 30 μm treated cultures. overall these results suggested the ability of rlx to induce apoptotic morphology in hct- <dig> cells.

discussions
in current study, an interesting correlation was revealed for the first time between various regulatory and phenotypic events of rlx with apoptosis. we first evaluated the growth inhibitory and cytotoxic effect of vasicinone analogues including rlx against panel of human cancer cell lines in vitro which includes leukemia , prostate , breast , pancreatic , colon  and normal epithelial cells . notably, we found for the first time that rlx inhibited cell growth and more importantly showed concentration dependent inhibition against panel of cancer cell lines tested. besides, maximum and potent growth inhibition following rlx treatment was observed in human colon cancer cell line i.e. hct- <dig>  keeping this in view, we further evaluated ic <dig> value of rlx against thp- <dig>  pc- <dig>  mcf, t47d, miapaca- <dig>  hct- <dig>  caco- <dig> and fr- <dig> cell lines by mtt assay, which was found minimum in hct- <dig> cells. overall, these results depicted that rlx showed significant effect against hct- <dig> and least effect on caco- <dig> colon cancer cell proliferation as reflected by relative ic <dig> value. since the nfκb pathway is important for cell survival, proliferation, cell cycle progression and migration which therefore affects regulation of proliferative, anti-apoptotic, pro-apoptotic and cell cycle regulatory molecules and thus results in cell survival, proliferation, progression and migration of numerous cancers
 <cit> . nfκb promotes cell survival via the induction of proteins that inhibits the components of apoptotic machinery in normal as well as cancerous cells
 <cit> . to evaluate the mechanism by which effect of rlx occurred, we further examined the effect on nfκb protein expression. the most abundant form of nfκb consists of a p <dig> subunit and a p <dig> subunit. in its inactive form, nfκb is located in the cytoplasm however, upon activation by various stimuli, it translocates to the nucleus, where it may activate genes leading to cell survival or proliferation
 <cit> . notably, our study demonstrated that exposure to rlx resulted in remarkable down-regulation in expression of nfκb . furthermore, caspases play a pivotal role in the mechanism of apoptosis as they are both the initiators and executioners. among caspases, caspase- <dig> is a frequently activated death protease, which catalyzes the specific cleavage of many key cellular proteins resulting in apoptosis
 <cit> . importantly, caspase- <dig> is crucial for apoptotic chromatin condensation and dna fragmentation in all cell types. here, we show that rlx mediates caspase- <dig> up-regulation in hct- <dig> cells. taken together, these data indicated that nfκb and caspase- <dig> play a pivotal role in mediating rlx induced apoptosis in hct- <dig> cells. cell migration plays a critical role in tumor cell invasion and metastasis
 <cit> . cell migration and invasion represents an important property for chemotherapeutic agent other than having potential to cause specific cancer cell death. molecules involved in cancer cell migration could be potential target for anti-metastasis therapy. we summarize how colon cancer cell migrate using rlx which is tested by measuring the gap between control and treatment groups. although rlx was found to actively inhibit colon cancer cell migration. notably, apoptosis is morphologically characterized by chromatin condensation, inter-nucleosome fragments, cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing and formation of apoptotic bodies without disruption of plasma membrane
 <cit> . in view of promising potential of rlx as an apoptotic agent, we further performed scanning electron microscopy  to assess early apoptotic morphological changes in hct- <dig> cells. data depicted a loss of microvilli on the surface of treated colon malignant cells and therefore revealed smoothening of cell surface which altogether validates formation of typical apoptotic feature on rlx treatment. this was supported by fluorescence microscopy using dapi with subsequent features of cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation in contrast to the control cells, which retained their polygonal structure.

CONCLUSIONS
we report for the first time that rlx has target based anticancer activity. a very important property for a candidate anti-cancer drug is the ability to induce tumor cell apoptosis
 <cit>  and rlx exhibits this important characteristic feature. these findings should be useful for development of molecule targeted against various cancer signaling pathways.
