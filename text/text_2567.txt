BACKGROUND
all over the world, tumor is the second incurable disease only to cardiovascular disease. a wide range of proteins are found to be related to tumor formation and metastasis. however, only proteins with widespread biological significance for the tumor cells growth regulation are most possible to be the targets of broad-spectrum low-toxic antitumor drugs. in recent studies, histone deacetylases  are proved to be novel epigenetic targets for the treatment of cancer  <cit> . histone deacetylase inhibitors  have extensively demonstrated the antitumor efficacy in vitro and in vivo. therefore, the related study of hdaci has become one of the most important research fields of the antitumor drugs, especially during the coming area of epigenetics.

histone deacetylases comprise a superfamily of  <dig> genes which is divided into two families and four classes in eukaryotic cells. classes i, ii, and iv consist of  <dig> family members, which are referred to as “classical” hdacs, whereas the  <dig> class iii members are called “sirtuins”  <cit> .classical hdacs which require zn2+ as a cofactor for their deacetylase activity are a promising novel class of anti-cancer drug targets that can be inhibited by zn2+ chelating compounds such as hydroxamic acids. in contrast, these compounds are not active against sirtuins as these class iii enzymes have a different mechanism of action in requiring nad+ as an essential cofactor  <cit> . recent researches indicate that sirtuins are linked to aging as well as metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases  <cit> .

classical hdacs are classified based on their homology to yeast proteins. hdacs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> which belong to class i have homologies to yeast rpd <dig>  and they are located within the nucleus. hdacs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> which belong to class ii have homologies to yeast hda <dig> and located in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. it should be noted that class ii hdacs can be further subdivided based on their sequence homolog and domain organization, i.e. class iia, which include hdacs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> containing an n-terminal extension with regulatory function, and class iib, which include hdacs  <dig> and  <dig> containing two catalytic domains. hdac  <dig> is categorized into class iv with conserved residues in its catalytic center that are shared by both classes i and ii hdacs. the classification of classical hdacs is summarized in table  <dig> 

histone deacetylase inhibitors  that act on  <dig> zinc-dependent hdac isozymes generally possess a zinc-binding group which coordinates the zinc ion in the active site, a cap substructure that interacts with amino acids at the entrance of the n-acetylated lysine binding channel, and a linker connecting the cap and the zinc-binding group at a proper distance  <cit> . hdaci can be categorized into four subtypes based on their chemical structures:  short chain fatty acid;  hydroxamic acid;  benzamides; and  cyclic peptides. since hdaci do not inhibit all hdac isoforms to the same extent, they can be categorized into pan-hdac inhibitors and selective hdac inhibitors including class i-specific inhibitors, class ii-specific inhibitors, and class iv-specific inhibitors. currently, many hdac inhibitors have already been tested in clinical trials and shown certain antitumor or other biological activity. however, some hdac inhibitors, especially pan-inhibitors, indicate serious side effects, such as fatigue, nausea, anorexia, diarrhea, thrombus formation, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, myalgia, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, etc. <cit> . thus, hdac inhibitors are possible to greatly improve the efficacy and reduce the certain toxicities only when they target the most relevant hdac isoform rather than multiple ones. consequently, it should be useful to discover or design novel antitumor drugs with fewer side effects when one method can analyze the interaction of inhibitors against multiple hdacs with further sorting out isoform- or class-specific inhibitors.

as for in silico drug discovery, there are many methods available such as molecular docking  <cit> , pharmacophore models, quantitative structure-activity relationship   <cit> , protein-ligand interaction fingerprint-based screening  <cit>  and others  <cit> . qsar is a widely applied computational method for predicting chemical compounds’ interactions with a single target protein. however, when thousands of chemical compounds interacted with  <dig> different hdac isoforms,  <dig> separate qsar models for each hdac isoform are needed to create, which is quite complicated and time consuming. in addition, these separate models cannot extended to predict inhibitions of new hdacs  <cit> . therefore, a new method should be proposed to predict cross-interactions of chemical compounds to multi-hdac isoforms simultaneously.

more recently, proteochemometric  modeling has been widely used to study the cross-interactions between a series of compounds and a series of proteins. in this area maris lapinsh et.al studied melanocortin chimeric receptors using partial least-squares projections  to deduce pcm models  <cit> ; hanna geppert et.al derived pcm models of eleven proteases from four different protease families by support vector machine  <cit> ; ilona mandrika and maris lapinsh et.al applied pls to model interactions of hiv mutants  <cit>  and antibodies  <cit> . contrary to traditional qsar, pcm is based on the similarity of a group of ligands together with that of a group of targets  <cit> . consequently, pcm can integrate several separate qsar models into a global one. with the global pcm model in hand, we can study the cross interactions of all the ligands with all the targets in the data set or even outside the data set. by predicting the affinity for each ligand-target pair, pcm models can describe the specific interaction between a ligand and a target and discriminate the interaction strength between different ligand-target pairs. therefore, in our study pcm models were applied to study the cross-interactions of a series of hdac inhibitors to five hdac isoforms, i.e., hdac <dig>  hdac <dig>  hdac <dig>  hdac <dig>  and hdac <dig> 

RESULTS
proteochemometric modeling
in our study,  <dig> proteochemometric models were created from training set with combinations of different descriptors. as shown in table  <dig>  goodness-of-fits  of all models were higher than  <dig>  and their cross validation coefficients qcv <dig> ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the model derived based on p <dig> and gd showed to be the best model with the highest predictive ability . accordingly p1-gd model was used in the subsequent analysis.

a p0-dli means this model is based on protein descriptor p <dig> and ligand descriptor dli.

b p1-gd-c means this model is based on protein descriptor p <dig>  ligand descriptor gd and cross-terms.

c c means this model is based on only cross-terms of p <dig> and dli.

p <dig> vs p <dig> vs p2
three protein descriptors, i.e., sequence similarity descriptor , structure similarity descriptor  and geometry descriptor , were used to describe hdacs in our study. sequence similarity descriptor is based on the sequence identities of hdacs, while structure similarity descriptor and geometry descriptor leftacterize hdacs based on their 3d-structures. protein descriptors are different from ligand descriptors since proteins have larger molecule structures to describe. if available, proteins are likely to be described on the basis of crystal structures. protein structure similarity descriptor was calculated by protein 3d-struture alignment with more sufficient information considered. contrary to p <dig>  p <dig> only leftacterizes protein based on sequence alignment, and may lose certain 3d information of proteins. not surprisingly, models derived from p <dig> showed a better predictive ability than those of p <dig> . in addition, although p <dig> is also derived based on 3d-structure, it only measures bond length, bond angle and dihedral angle statistically without much of the detailed information of proteins, thus it is not sufficient to leftacterize proteins comprehensively. as a result, we also found that models based on geometry descriptor obtained the worst predictive ability  compared to the others.

the highest qtest2s of every group are highlighted.

gd vs dli
similar to protein descriptors, two typical kinds of ligand descriptors, i.e., general descriptor  and drug-like index  were applied. our result indicates that there was no significant difference between q <dig> values of models based on gd and dli , with p-value bigger than  <dig>  by paired t-test.

paired t test: t =  <dig> .

it should be noted that there are a large number of different descriptors available for ligands, and there is no optimal one suitable for all the data sets. therefore, it is wise to try several different descriptors to identify the optimal one in a particular scenario  <cit> . in our study, we used two different ligand descriptors, gd and dli to create pcm models. these two kinds of descriptors leftacterize physical properties and topological indices of ligands respectively. for our particular data set, there was no statistically difference in predictive ability between these two ligand descriptors.

model performance with or without cross-terms
a multiplied cross-term was used in our models and it was shown to be helpless in the improvement of the predictive ability of pcm models. the qtest <dig> of models with cross-terms is lower than that without cross-terms in every group .

the highest qtest2s of every group are highlighted.

although cross-terms are intended to describe the properties of the interface between ligand and protein, there is still no good descriptor for the representation of local receptor-ligand interfaces  <cit> , which may possibly result in the worse performance of the multiplied cross-term in our pcm models. recently, a new protein-ligand interaction fingerprint was derived for in silico screening  <cit> . this interaction fingerprint is a local descriptor to represent the interfaces of receptor-ligand and proved to be a good candidate cross-term in pcm. theoretically, it should achieve better performance if the crystal complex structure exists. however, since there is no crystal structure available for most of the receptor-ligand pairs in our data set, thousands of complex structures have to be produced by molecular docking to apply interaction fingerprint, which may result in biases. therefore, the interaction fingerprint was not adopted in our study.

selective ability of proteochemometric model
in our study, we aimed to exploit an effective method to screen selective hdac inhibitors which has selective activity on a single or a specific class of hdac isoforms. for this purpose, proteochemometrics was applied to analyze the interaction strength of inhibitors against multiple hdacs, and then select out isoform-specific, class-specific as well as pan inhibitors. to verify the performance of the derived pcm models, an external validation of ten inhibitors was carried out to predict affinity with the best model . the predicted values are compared with the corresponding experimental ones as shown in table  <dig> 

a s, w,n and nd is the experimental affinity of inhibitors and the numerical number is the predicted affinity data. those predicted values larger than  <dig> are supposed to have inhibition with highlighted.

s strong inhibition.

w weak inhibition.

n no inhibition.

nd no data pubilshed.

among the ten inhibitors for external validation, tsa, saha, lbh <dig> and pxd- <dig> are reported as pan-hdac inhibitors and almost all their predicted affinity values are high for all the hdac isoforms in our test . in addition, mgcd <dig>  fk <dig> and apicidin are reported as class i-specific inhibitors and our results also indicated that the predicted values for class i hdacs are higher than those of others . finally apha, tubacin and nct-10a are reported as class ii-specific inhibitors and our results are consistent with the validation data that their predicted values are higher for class ii hdacs .

as a conclusion, our best pcm model performs well in screening selective hdac inhibitors and distinguishing pan-hdac inhibitors, class i-specific inhibitors and class ii-specific inhibitors successfully. therefore, this model can be further used to screen class-selective inhibitors as well as isoform-selective inhibitors of hdacs with fewer side effects.

CONCLUSIONS
although more and more hdac inhibitors have been identified to date, the number of class-selective inhibitors or isoform-selective inhibitors is insufficient. thus, it is important to find these selective inhibitors which are candidate therapeutic agents for tumor with reduced side effects. in this study, proteochemometric models were derived to analyze the inhibitory activity of  <dig> compounds with  <dig> hdac isoforms simultaneously. among these models, the best one, p1-gd model, was highly predictive  and presented powerful ability to distinguish selective hdac inhibitors from the pan ones. as a conclusion, proteochemometric modeling proves to be a suitable methodology for the prediction of inhibitor interactions with hdac isoforms. our study also indicates that the obtained optimal model can be potentially used for designing candidate antitumor drugs which can selectively target on a single hdac or a specific class of hdac isoforms.
