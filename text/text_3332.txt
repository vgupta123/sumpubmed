BACKGROUND
gram-positive cocci pose a worldwide threat to human health. the emergence of antibiotic resistance in gram-positive cocci, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus , vancomycin-resistant staphylococci  and vancomycin-resistant enterococci , has created a clinical demand for effective novel therapeutic agents. linezolid , the first member of the oxazolidinone class of antibiotics, was approved for clinical use in  <dig> and has a broad spectrum of activity against a variety of gram-positive pathogens. it acts by inhibiting protein synthesis via binding to the peptidyl transferase centre of the 50s ribosomal subunit, and preventing formation of the fmet-trna-30s ribosome-mrna initiation complex  <cit> . because of its unique antimicrobial mechanism, linezolid has been widely applied in the treatment of clinically-important gram-positive bacteria, including aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive cocci, aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacilli, and nocardia and mycobacteria species. however, linezolid-resistant  staphylococcus was first reported in peritonitis patients undergoing oral linezolid treatment during peritoneal dialysis in  <dig>  <cit> . since then, the occurrence of lr strains has been reported worldwide  <cit> .

the major mechanism of resistance to linezolid is caused by mutations in the v domain of the 23s rrna gene, with a g2576t substitution  occurring most frequently. c2104t, g2447t, t2500a, a2503g, t2504a, g2603t and g2631t substitutions have also been found in lr strains  <cit> . another resistance mechanism is horizontal acquisition of cfr, which encodes a methyltransferase and modifies adenosine at a <dig> in the 23s rrna. cfr is usually plasmid-located and confers cross-resistance to phenicol, lincosamide, oxazolidinone, pleuromutilin and streptogramin a   <cit> . alterations in the ribosomal proteins l <dig>  l <dig> and l <dig>  encoded by rplc, rpld and rplv, respectively, have also been associated with increased resistance to linezolid  <cit> . in addition, secondary resistance mechanisms, such as biofilm formation and cell wall thickening, can enhance resistance to antibiotics as well  <cit> .

as the global emergence of lr isolates has increased  <cit> , lr gram-positive cocci have also become a problem in china  <cit> . to comprehensively understand the current prevalence and resistance mechanisms among lr clinical isolates in china, we analysed  <dig> linezolid-resistant/intermediate strains, including 14 staphylococcus capitis, three s. aureus,  <dig> enterococcus faecalis and one enterococcus faecium isolates.

multilocus sequence typing  analysis
s. aureus, e. faecalis and e. faecium were screened using a previously described method  <cit>  to detect the seven housekeeping genes. for s. aureus, there are carbamate kinase , shikimate dehydrogenase , glycerol kinase , guanylate kinase , phosphate acetyltransferase , triosephosphate isomerase , and acetyl coenzyme a acetyltransferase . for e. faecalis, there are glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase , glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , phosphate atp binding cassette transporter , glucokinase , shikimate-5-dehydrogenase , xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase , and acetyl-coa acetyltransferase . for e. faecium, there are adenylate kinase , atp synthase, alpha subunit , d-alanine:d-alanine ligase , glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase , phosphoribosylaminoimidazol carboxylase atpase subunit , and phosphate atp-binding cassette transporter . each sequence was submitted to the mlst website  to determine the allelic profile and sequence type  of each isolate  <cit> .

pfge
pfge was performed according to a previously described method  <cit>  with some modifications. the staphylococci were treated with lysostaphin  and genomic dna was prepared in agarose blocks and then digested with the restriction enzyme smai . the dna fragments were separated using a chef-dr ii pfge system  for 20 h at 6 v/cm and 14°c, with a pulse angle of 120° and pulse times from 5–25 s. pfge banding patterns were analysed visually.

molecular detection of resistance genes and mutations
isolates were screened for the presence of cfr and mutations in the 23s rrna and the l <dig>  l <dig> and l <dig> ribosomal proteins by pcr and dna sequencing, as previously described  <cit> . amplicons were sequenced on both strands and were compared with those from s. aureus atcc  <dig>  e. faecalis atcc  <dig>  ls s. capitis and ls e. faecium, obtained from shanghai huashan hospital during the study period, using the lasergene software package .

gene dosage
gene dosage was determined according to a previously described method  <cit>  with some modifications. isolates of lr s. capitis containing mutations in the central loop of the 23s rrna gene were amplified using primers based on the s. capitis 23s rrna gene . thermal cycler conditions were 94°c for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94°c , 55°c  and 72°c , with a final extension at 72°c . the dna concentration of pcr amplicons was normalized to  <dig>  pmol prior to cloning. then, the amplification products were ligated to plasmid pmd-18 t  and transformed into e. coli dh5α cells . each lr s. capitis was cloned and  <dig> clones from each strain were sequenced.

plasmid analysis and cfr location
plasmid dna was extracted from all cfr-carrying isolates using a plasmid dna midi kit  and separated on 1%  agarose gel. the migration distances of dna bands were measured directly from gel photographs in relation to the reference plasmids in e. coli v <dig>  marker. plasmid dna bands were transferred onto a nylon membrane by southern blotting. a cfr-specific labelled probe  was generated using a non-radioactive dig high prime dna labelling and detection kit  according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and was hybridised to the membrane. to determine the genetic environment of cfr, the partial plasmid dna sequence of all cfr-carrying isolates was determined using the following primers, designed based on the sequence of pss- <dig> : 1 f 5′- cacttcctttattatttttc-3′; 1r 5′- cgactgaatcaagaagtacg-3′; 2 f 5′-tgaaccataacctttgtc-3′, 2r 5′-tgtttctagcctgactga-3′; 3 f 5′-actcgatggtcctcacgg-3′, 3r 5′-tcaggctcattattacttc-3′; 4 f 5′-ttaccactagagcaaatt′, 4r 5′-gaccacaagcagcgycaa-3′; 5 f 5′-aatggactactgggtgga-3′, 5r 5′-atgattcagaaagcagat-3′; 6 f 5′-ctttccgaatggactaat-3′, 6r 5′-tgagcgcagctttacgac-3′ . amplification products from the ten cfr-carrying plasmids were sequenced on both strands and were compared with plasmid pss- <dig> using the lasergene software package . in addition, the purified plasmids extracted from each of the ten original strains were electrotransformed  into the s. aureus recipient strain rn <dig>  transformants were incubated in fresh tryptic soy broth  at 37°c with shaking at 200 rpm for 1 h and then were selected by incubation for 24 h at 37°c on tsb agar supplemented with 6 μg/ml linezolid. the linezolid mics of transformants were measured by the broth microdilution method. plasmid dna was extracted from all the transformants and separated on 1% agarose gel. southern hybridisation was then used to confirm whether the plasmids were cfr-positive as described previously  <cit> .

detection of biofilm production
all lr strains were divided into four groups by species . s. capitis group contained  <dig> lr isolates and  <dig> ls isolates. s. aureus group contained  <dig> lr isolates and  <dig> ls isolates. e. faecalis group contained  <dig> lr isolates and  <dig> ls isolates. e. faecium group contained  <dig> lr isolate and  <dig> ls isolates. a semi-quantitative biofilm assay was conducted using flat-bottomed, tissue culture-treated, 96-well assay plates . four wells in each assay plate contained untreated cultures, which served as negative controls. bacteria were prepared by making a 1: <dig> dilution of an overnight culture grown in tsb containing 5 g/l glucose. assay plates were inoculated with 200 μl of culture per well  and were incubated at 37°c for 24 h. the medium were removed from assay plates. then assay plates were washed four times with pbs. biofilms were fixed by bouin’s fixation for at least 1 h then assay plates were washed four times with pbs. following crystal violet staining, the biofilms were measured using a synergy h <dig> hybrid multi-mode microplate reader  at od <dig> 

transmission electron microscopy 
isolates for tem were grown from a single colony in 10 ml of liquid brain-heart infusion  medium with  <dig> %  beef extract. four groups were studied. the s. capitis group contained strains hs12- <dig> , hs09- <dig> , hs09-17 + lzd , hs12- <dig>  and hs12-55 + lzd . the s. aureus group contained s. aureus atcc <dig> , hs11- <dig>  and hs11-202 + lzd . the e. faecalis group contained e. faecalis atcc <dig> , hs11- <dig> , hs12- <dig>  and hs12-309 + lzd . finally, the e. faecium group contained strains hs13- <dig>  and hs11- <dig> . the cells were grown at 37°c with shaking at 200 rpm for approximately 4–5 h to mid-exponential phase . an 8-ml volume of each culture was pelleted by centrifugation at 4000 g for 15 min and suspended in 1 ml of  <dig> %  glutaraldehyde in  <dig>  m phosphate buffer, and stored at 4°c for at least 2 h. the cells were then post-fixed with 1%  osmium tetroxide in the same buffer. following dehydration, cells were infiltrated with and embedded in eponate  <dig> resin for 24 h. ultrathin sections were cut at 70 nm, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and then examined on a jem- <dig> 80 kv tem  equipped with a gatan orius sc200w camera. images were captured at  <dig> × magnification and measurements were made using imagej software  <cit> . thirty cell walls were measured per sample, and means and standard deviations were calculated in excel .

resistance genes and mutations
a novel c2131t mutation and a previously reported g2603t mutation, both in domain v of the 23s rrna gene, were identified in all s. capitis isolates . all s. capitis isolates, except hs09- <dig>  hs09- <dig>  hs10- <dig>  hs10- <dig> and hs13- <dig>  were positive for cfr. furthermore, s. capitis hs12- <dig> and hs12- <dig> had c316t  mutations in ribosomal protein l <dig>  but no mutations were detected in ribosomal proteins l <dig> or l <dig> in any isolates. among s. aureus isolates, only hs12- <dig> was positive for cfr. s. aureus hs11- <dig> had a c389g  mutation in ribosomal protein l <dig>  but proteins l <dig> and l <dig> were wild-type. no mutation was identified in any of the studied genes in the e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates, nor was cfr detected.

gene dosage
gene dosage tests were performed on fourteen lr s. capitis isolates that contained mutations in domain v of the 23s rrna gene. isolates with different linezolid resistance levels displayed diverse c2131t and g2603t mutation rates . the relationship between linezolid resistance levels and the percentage of mutated 23s rrna genes in s. capitis is shown in figure  <dig>  clones derived from s. capitis  had mutation rates of  <dig> – <dig> %  and  <dig> –100% , and those derived from s. capitis  had mutation rates of  <dig> – <dig> %  and  <dig> –100% .figure  <dig>

discussion
the prevalence of mrsa, vrs and vre strains has presented a new challenge in antimicrobial medication. linezolid is one of the few treatment options that is highly active against gram-positive pathogens. however, lr strains have been increasingly reported in worldwide  <cit>  and now have also emerged in china  <cit> . although the incidence of linezolid resistance among gram-positive organisms remains low, the emergence of lr strains is still of great concern.

surveillance data in our study suggested that all the lr s. capitis were recovered from bacteraemia patients, whereas lr s. aureus  came from respiratory tract specimens. linezolid-resistant/intermediate enterococci were collected from blood, urine, wound, bile and prostatic fluid. all of the patients infected with lr staphylococci were critically ill, which is consistent with findings from previous studies  <cit> . a study in spain  <cit>  described that lr strains emerged after patients received three courses of linezolid for 600 mg every 12 h for 14 days. interestingly, as shown in table  <dig>  only seven hospitalised patients  in our study had received linezolid therapy  prior to the appearance of lr strains. the remaining patients, other than outpatients whose antibiotic drug histories were not determined, had not been exposed to linezolid. so, except for linezolid exposure, if there were other factors involved worth considering.

nowadays, linezolid susceptibility of gram-positive clinical isolates is mainly monitored through two surveillance programmes, the zyvox annual appraisal of potency and spectrum  program in europe and the linezolid experience and accurate determination of resistance  program in usa. in  <dig>  the zaaps program analysed the linezolid activity of  <dig> g-positive clinical isolates collected over 9 years  from  <dig> medical centres in  <dig> countries on five continents  <cit> . data showed that  <dig> % of cons ,  <dig> % of s. aureus ,  <dig> % of e. faecalis  and  <dig> % of e. faecium  isolates were resistant to linezolid. gu et al.  <cit>  summarized the linezolid susceptibility profile of staphylococci from the leader program over 7 years . data showed that  <dig> % of cons  and  <dig> % of s. aureus  isolates were resistant to linezolid. our data showed that the incidence of lr strains in china was higher than that of the two surveillance programs, except for lrcons which was similar to that of the leader program. in particular, the incidence of lrcons in china was nine times higher than that of lrsa, and the incidence of lr e. faecalis was  <dig> times higher than that of lr e. faecium, suggesting that ongoing surveillance is necessary.

recently, multifocal outbreaks of lr staphylococci have been reported, including s. epidermidis , s. cohnii , s. haemolyticus , s. sciuri , s. capitis , s. hominis , s. lugdenesis  and s. aureus , and linezolid-resistant/intermediate enterococci, including e. faecalis , e. faecium  and e. avium   <cit> . in our study, we detected multiple lr s. capitis, s. aureus, e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates. notably, the clinically-derived lrsa isolates characterised in our investigation are the first to be reported in china. previous studies  <cit>  described that most of lrcons in china exhibited high-level resistance , with very few low- and medium-level lr isolates, whereas in other countries  <cit> , low to medium-level lrcons  were more common, with a lack of high-level lrcons strains. in contrast, the  <dig> lrcons isolates in our study exhibited a wide range of linezolid resistance levels, with mics from  <dig> to 512 μg/ml. three lrsa isolates exhibited linezolid resistance , which were higher than lrsa isolates from italy, hong kong and brazil . thereinto, two of the lrsa isolates were methicillin-resistant and multidrug-resistant, whereas hs09- <dig> lrsa was methicillin-susceptible. moreover, low-level resistance in linezolid-resistant/intermediate enterococci  was similar to previous studies  <cit> . mlst and pfge results showed that lr s. capitis, lr s. aureus, e. faecalis and e. faecium were polyclonal, suggesting diverse sts were all vulnerable to linezolid exposure.

known mechanisms of linezolid resistance in gram-positive cocci include mutations in the 23s rrna gene, acquisition of cfr and mutations of ribosomal proteins l <dig>  l <dig> and l <dig>  the novel mutation c2131t and the previously-described mutation g2603t in the v domain of the 23s rrna were identified in all  <dig> lr s. capitis clones. although g2603t was first reported in  <dig>  <cit> , this is the first report of this mutation in china. the novel mutation c2131t, whether it plays a role in linezolid resistance is uncertain and needs a further confirmation. but this revelation may provide new information for investigating the mechanism of linezolid resistance caused by mutations in the v domain of 23s rrna gene. because staphylococci possess five or six copies of the 23s rrna gene, linezolid resistance caused by 23s rrna mutations develop slowly. besier et al. indicated that accumulation of single point mutations might be associated with gradually-increasing levels of resistance, in a mechanism known as “gene dosage”  <cit> . to gain insight into the relationship between gene dosage and 23s rrna mutations, we examined the proportion of cloned pcr products with mutations. our data showed that the percentage of clones with g2603t mutation was significantly higher than that with the c2131t mutation. independent of other resistance mechanisms, various levels of the 23s rrna mutations mediated low- to medium-level linezolid resistance . moreover, the synergistic action of mutations in the 23s rrna gene and ribosomal proteins l <dig> and l <dig>  as well as acquisition of cfr gene mediated high-level linezolid resistance . however, the complicated background of resistance mechanisms involved and the biological characteristics of the clinical bacteria overlaid the relationship between gene dosage and linezolid resistance levels.

the cfr gene is often located on transferable plasmid and is thus considered to promote horizontal spread of linezolid resistance. in our study,  <dig> lr staphylococcal isolates  harboured cfr gene and all the s. aureus rn <dig> transformants showed that cfr-carrying phs mediate medium-level linezolid resistance . wang et al. had indicated the two copies of is256-like elements played an important role in the dissemination of cfr in animal isolates  <cit> . subsequently, similar structures were found in lr s. capitis from zhejiang  <cit> , lr s. cohnii from beijing  <cit> , and now lr s. capitis and lr s. aureus from shanghai in the current study. notably, the phs with cfr flanked by is256-like elements is the first to be reported in a lrsa strain  in this study. moreover, compared with plasmid s. capitis mhz  from zhejiang  <cit> , s. capitis phs possessed additional upstream aminoglycoside resistance gene aaca-aphd. considering the first cfr-positive lr s. capitis strain was detected in  <dig> and hs12- <dig> lrsa which carried the same plasmid emerged in  <dig>  it suggested that the phs was most probably transferred from lrcons to lrsa. this finding presented significant concerns about the possibility of cfr-positive lrcons acting as reservoirs for linezolid resistance. based on the information above, cfr flanked by two is256-like elements may be transmitted from animal-derived isolates to human-derived isolates and spread horizontally within, or even between, bacterial species. therefore, ongoing surveillance is essential to avoid the dissemination of linezolid resistance.

mutations in ribosomal proteins l <dig>  l <dig> and l <dig> of the peptidyltransferase centre also contribute to decreased susceptibility to linezolid  <cit> . in our study, mutation c316t  in l <dig> was first detected in two s. capitis clones  and mutation c389g  in l <dig> was first detected in s. aureus . none of the lr isolates contained mutations in l <dig>  because no other mutation was detected in s. aureus hs11- <dig>  which has a linezolid mic of 16 μg/ml, suggesting that the ala130gly mutation in l <dig> might be associated with low-level linezolid resistance.

biofilm could provide a microenvironment for bacteria to survive. bacteria in a biofilm aggregated into micelles which could withstand attacks by innate host defence mechanisms and evaded the threats of antibiotics  <cit> . we performed a semi-quantitative biofilm assay, which only showed that biofilm formation was significantly higher in lr e. faecalis isolates than in ls e. faecalis isolates. this suggested that formation of biofilm might increase low-level resistance to linezolid in lr e. faecalis .

we performed tem to determine whether the decreased susceptibility of li and/or lr strains was related to the thickness of the cell wall. we found that the cell walls of li and lr strains were significantly thicker than ls strains. also, the cell walls of lr strains grown with linezolid were thicker than those of lr strains grown without linezolid. these thicked cell wall bacteria were probably selected by the linezolid pressure and might be able to avoid clearance in patients undergoing antibiotic therapy. there was no significant differences in cell wall thickness between li and lr strains. data suggested that the thickness of the cell wall might decrease susceptibility to linezolid to a certain degree, but not play a major role in linezolid resistance. furthermore, no significant differences in cell wall thickness were observed between ls hs13- <dig> and li hs11- <dig> e. faecium isolates, however, we observed a thick transparent substance around the bacteria. whether this substance might hinder linezolid absorption and result in resistance is unknown.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, various levels of lr strains have emerged in shanghai, china in our study. mutiple resistance mechanism were involved in these lr strains. although the prevalence of resistance to linezolid remains low, the emergence of lr staphylococcal and enterococcal clinical isolates should prompt increased attention, especially for the horizontal dissemination of cfr, and surveillance of linezolid resistance in gram-positive bacteria is of increasing importance.
