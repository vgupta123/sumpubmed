BACKGROUND
sugar beet  is a crop grown in temperate geographic regions for its high sugar content in the root, which accounts for about 30 % of the sugar production in the world. this species is one of our youngest cultivated crop plants whereupon work on crop improvements started in the mid-1800s and was enhanced after world war ii  <cit> . sugar beet has a genome with a size of about 567 mb comprising  <dig>  protein-coding genes  <cit> . this new knowledge is expected to facilitate further crop improvements and diversified utilization of carbohydrates in various bio-products and for biofuel production. sugar beets have a rather long growing season that is between  <dig> to 6 months. hence, it is vulnerable to many soil-borne pathogens. rhizoctonia solani  is one of them. this anamorphic basidiomycete fungus has a wide host range causing disease on more than  <dig> plant species  <cit> . on crop plants, r. solani is known to cause rice sheath blight, black scurf on potatoes, bare patch on cereals and root or stem rot on soybean among many other diseases  <cit> . in case of sugar beet, this facultative saprophyte causes crown- and root-rot as well as seedling damping-off resulting in significant damages. the root-rot disease is considered to be most severe inciting losses of 24 % per acre regarding sugar beet cultivation in the us and 10 % in some european regions  <cit> . the r. solani life cycle is not completely known. this fungal species does not produce any asexual spores and only occasionally forms sexual spores. in nature, r. solani exists primarily as mycelia and survives as sclerotia in crop residues and soil  <cit> . these survival structures can reside in soil for many years and germinate and infect sugar beet roots, petioles and crowns under favorable conditions. typically, leaves collapse and wilt, but often stay attached to the crown. the fungus causes dark lesions on roots, when attacking somewhat older plants; these symptoms develop into rotted root tissue as the disease progresses.

rhizoctonia solani has a compatibility system that regulates the fusion of hyphae. based on this hyphal reaction, different anastomosis groups  can be distinguished. at least thirteen ags have been specified up to now and many of them are further subdivided into so-called inter-specific groups  featuring different host ranges, culture appearances or thiamine requirements . phylogenetic analysis using 18s rrna sequences also split the different r. solani genotypes into two major clades, suggesting divergent evolution  <cit> . r. solani members of the ag <dig> group cause canker on many root crops  <cit> . ag <dig> is further subdivided into type  <dig> and type  <dig>  most isolates of type- <dig> derive from sugar beets or soils, where sugar beets have been grown. ag2- <dig> is further subdivided into ag2-2iiib and ag2-2iv based on pathogenicity and culture morphology characteristics. however, the latter subgroups cannot be distinguished by hyphal fusion. both subgroups are pathogenic to sugar beet, but ag2-2iiib isolates are more aggressive than ag2-2iv ones  <cit> . here, we report on the  <dig>  mb draft genome of r. solani ag2-2iiib harboring  <dig>  predicted genes as determined by application of a specific gene model developed for this isolate. comparative genomic analyses with four other sequenced r. solani isolates representing different anastomosis groups revealed differences regarding predicted secreted proteins and enrichment of cell wall degrading enzymes in r. solani ag2-2iiib.

RESULTS
the r. solani ag2-2iiib draft genome sequence
the draft genome sequence of the r. solani ag2-2iiib isolate bba  <dig> was established by high-throughput sequencing on the illumina miseq system. sequencing resulted in  <dig> , <dig> reads yielding approximately  <dig>  giga bases of information. considering the final size of the r. solani ag2-2iiib draft assembly, a 40-fold coverage was estimated. detailed sequencing statistics of the r. solani ag2-2iiib genome are summarized in additional file 1: table s <dig>  after sequencing and assembly of sequencing reads, a ‘contig-length vs. read-count’ analysis was performed to gain deeper insights into r. solani ag2-2iiib genome composition, architecture and partition as previously described  <cit> . based on this strategy assembled contigs were classified in five different groups . group i contigs  presumably represent assembly artifacts. contigs representing groups ii  and iii  most likely contain chromosomal sequences reflecting the diploid nature of the r. solani ag2-2iiib genome. group ii contigs include sequences that are sufficiently different and therefore were assembled into individual contigs, whereas group iii contigs represent identical or almost identical allelic variants of the sequenced diploid organism. similar results were obtained for the r. solani ag1-ib genome sequence  <cit> . the contigs of groups iv and v were mostly allocated to the more abundant mitochondrial  genome  or the most abundant dna encoding ribosomal rnas . in addition, the cegma analysis resulted in identification of  <dig> of  <dig> core eukaryotic genes  including  <dig> complete and  <dig> partial cegs . the average number of orthologs per ceg was  <dig>  . this result underlines the completeness of genome as well as the diploid character of the genome.

the identified r. solani ag2-2iiib mitochondrial  genome consists of eight scaffolds and  <dig> contigs. based on this result, the mt genome seems to be fragmented and not completed. many mt contigs are shorter than 500 bp indicating prevalence of highly repetitive a + t spacer sequences that partly hampered sequencing and assembly. scaffolds representing the r. solani ag2-2iiib mt genome add up to  <dig>  bp featuring a gc content of  <dig>  %. accordingly, the size of the r. solani ag2-2iiib mitochondrial genome appears to be smaller than known mt genomes of other r. solani isolates with estimated sizes of approximately 150 kb . core genes, including nad gene copies , a cob gene , three cox genes , three atp genes , two ribosomal rna genes and a ribosomal protein rbs gene were predicted on the contigs of this mt genome. in comparison to the r. solani ag1-ib mt genome, the dpob gene  is missing in ag2-2iiib. pcr analysis confirmed the absence of this gene. in addition,  <dig> sequences encoding trnas as well as two laglidadg homing endonucleases were identified. based on the found conserved mt genes and trnas, it appears that the majority of the ag2-2iiib mt genome was assembled in this approach.

development of an ag2-2iiib-specific gene model based on mapping of expressed sequence tags 
in parallel to sequencing of the r. solani ag2-2iiib genome, two normalized est  libraries of the fungal isolate were sequenced. the main objectives of this approach were to elucidate the gene structure of r. solani ag2-2iiib and to deduce a corresponding gene model for improved gene prediction on genomic contigs . ests were obtained from r. solani ag2-2iiib grown under two different conditions. either r. solani was cultivated in potato dextrose broth  or in a sugar beet medium. the latter to enrich for r. solani transcripts induced by the presence of particular sugar beet compounds. moreover, ests provide information on precise intron-exon structures. mapping of ests on genomic sequences enables development of a corresponding gene model as previously demonstrated for r. solani ag1-ib  <cit> .

total rna was isolated after growth of r. solani in the media specified above. subsequently, cdna libraries were generated and normalized to avoid over-representation of highly expressed transcripts, such as ribosomal rnas  and transcripts representing ribosomal proteins. both cdna libraries were de novo sequenced on the illumina miseq platform. this approach yielded  <dig> , <dig> reads and approximately  <dig>  giga bases of sequence information. detailed results of subsequent de novo assemblies by means of the gsassembler software  are shown in additional file 4: table s <dig>  about 98 % of all reads were assembled indicating saturation of the sequencing approach. likewise, rarefaction analysis considering formation of isotigs  from read sub-samples also showed that ests were sequenced in sufficient depth. the largest isotig has a size of 7035 bp, whereas the shortest is 107 bp in size.

assembled isotigs were mapped onto r. solani ag2-2iiib genome sequences to define the borders of exon-intron and intron-exon junctions, locate gene start-sites and to uncover alternative splicing events . in total,  <dig>  of  <dig>  r. solani ag2-2iiib isotigs were mapped on the genome with more than 95 % sequence identity and more than 90 % template coverage. a survey of alternative splicing events applying astalavista revealed  <dig> events. in total,  <dig> mapped transcripts represent 'intron-retention' events,  <dig> 'alternative acceptor-site' events,  <dig> 'alternative donor-site' events,  <dig> 'exon-skipping' events, whereas  <dig> events could not be classified into one of these four categories. evidence for the definition of correct gene start and stop positions was also deduced from mapped isotigs. finally, a specific r. solani ag2-2iiib gene model was deduced and applied for gene prediction within the eukaryotic gene prediction program augustus as previously described  <cit> . development of a specific gene model was motivated by the chance to uncover new genes that are not expressed under the conditions applied for the est sequencing approach and to enable comparative analyses between the genomes of different r. solani isolates.

to further improve gene predictions for the r. solani ag2-2iiib genome, a manual curation step was introduced. to assess the quality of the gene prediction approach, gene products deduced from identified genes were compared with those inferred from ests by blastp. in total, 95 % of all gene products predicted in the genome were represented by an isotig , whereas  <dig> genes were only predicted based on the parameter set. however,  <dig> of  <dig>  isotigs were mapped twice or more on the genome sequence. accordingly, the r. solani ag2-2iiib specific gene model proved to be very reliable for gene prediction in this fungal genotype. in total,  <dig>  predicted genes were automatically annotated by means of a modified gendb  <dig>  version  <cit>  including about 19 %  that appear as genes with multiple variants. this approach assigned functions and observations with high confidence values to  <dig> genes. however, most of the predicted genes were automatically annotated as 'hypothetical' or 'uncharacterized' illustrating insufficient functional characterization of fungal genomes from members of the genus rhizoctonia. the gendb annotation pipeline successfully assigned  <dig> gene names,  <dig>  ec numbers and  <dig>  kog numbers to the identified r. solani ag2-2iiib genes.

the pathogen-host interaction database  hosts molecular and biological information on more than  <dig> pathogen genes, which have been tested experimentally. out of  <dig> hits of the predicted ag2-2iiib genes, we found the highest proportion  attributed to the ‘reduced virulence’ category followed by a group of ‘unaffected pathogenicity’  as defined by the phi database  <cit>  .these assignments probably can be attributed to the wide range of aggressiveness reported between ag groups and isolates and the highly competitive saprophytic ability reported for r. solani  <cit> .fig.  <dig> distribution of phenotypic categories of ag2-2iiib gene orthologs using the phi database . the percentage is based on in total  <dig> hits



comparison of r. solani genomes with contrasting anastomosis groups
the r. solani ag2-2iiib genome of  <dig>  mbp was compared to those of other sequenced r. solani isolates, namely r. solani ag1-ia , ag1-ib , ag <dig>  and ag <dig>   <cit> . for gene-based comparisons of different r. solani isolates, the comparative genomics tool edgar  <cit>  was applied . the core genome of all r. solani isolates analyzed consists of  <dig> genes representing  <dig> to 25 % of all genes identified in each isolate . r. solani ag2-2iiib draft genome assembly harbors  <dig> isolate-specific genes . a general feature of r. solani is its heterokaryotic and diploid nature, which generates assembly challenges. various bioinformatics approaches have been used to dissect the ploidy levels of the five genomes sequenced so far. thus, differences seen between the genomes may to some degree derive from nuclear heterogeneity and precautions should be taken for a too strict interpretation of differences without additional verification.table  <dig> gene predictions in different r. solani strains

analysis of the predicted secretome
to establish a successful infection and evade plant defense responses during colonization, plant pathogens secrete proteins and other molecules, collectively termed effectors, to various host compartments  <cit> . these secreted effectors facilitate host colonization and thereby modulate host biochemistry, physiology, and defense responses. based on the r. solani ag2-2iiib draft genome assembly,  <dig> secreted proteins were predicted using the described secretome pipeline  <cit> , and among them,  <dig> were specific to ag2-2iiib . these results were compared to the other four r. solani genomes and to basidiomycete model pathogen ustilago maydis . the biotrophic fungal group represented by u. maydis possesses predicted biotrophic interactors that are highly specialized  <cit> . this kind of specific functions may not be expected to have evolved in a fungal species like r. solani with a broad host range. in general, ascomycetes, particularly necrotrophs thriving on dead or dying plant cells encode high numbers of secreted proteins, here represented by the verticillium dahliae, which is another soilborne pathogen with a broad host range including sugar beets  <cit> . further, many fungal effectors are known to be small cysteine-rich proteins with a size of less than  <dig> amino acids. in each r. solani draft genome assembly, around  <dig> small cysteine-rich proteins are predicted . necrosis and ethylene-inducing-like protein  genes are common in many plant pathogenic organisms not least those related with wilting disease symptoms like fusarium oxysporum and v. dahliae  <cit> . thus, nlp-encoding homologues were expected in the r. solani genomes but were found absent in all five cases. another effector group common in particularly ascomycete fungi including v. dahliae are genes with a predicted lysine motif   <cit> . however, very few genes harboring lysm were found in the r. solani genomes . quantitative real-time pcr  was used to determine transcript levels of selected r. solani ag2-2iiib secreted genes. we used four sugar beet breeding lines, two susceptible and two partial resistant towards the ag2-2iiib isolate to monitor fungal responses upon interaction with its host. first, we checked if the rsolag22iiib_ <dig> gene, encoding the putative secreted lysm protein was active during infection. elevated transcript levels were observed during interactions with the partial resistant genotypes  compared to mycelia grown in vitro, but no significant differences were observed among the plant genotypes . lysm proteins can be grouped in two classes based on the architecture of the lysm-containing proteins and the location of cysteine residues  <cit> . based on present information the rsolag22iiib_ <dig> gene has features typical of a fungal-specific lysm motif.fig.  <dig> predicted effectors  and other secreted proteins  in: five rhizoctonia solani anastomosis groups , two sugar beet pathogens  and the basidiomycete species ustilago maydis. numbers of potential effector proteins  are defined as small cysteine-rich proteins featuring at least 3 % cysteine and a maximum size of  <dig> amino acids

distribution of carbohydrate active enzyme genes and transcript analysis of selected gene candidates
the plant cell wall is an important barrier for plants to protect themselves from a range of attacking organisms. thus, it is essential for a phytopathogenic fungus like r. solani ag2-2iiib, with no specialized penetration appressoria-like structure shown so far, to have means of entering by weakening the host cell walls, thereby promoting colonization. further, soilborne pathogens are confined within the soil, a complex matrix of minerals, organic matter and a rich diversity of organisms. to survive and multiply, a plant pathogen must compete with a multitude of organisms. thus, competition for resources, and various community compositions significantly affects pathogen invasion rates on plant roots  <cit> . in this battlefield, lytic enzymes and secreted toxic compounds are essential  <cit> . the cazy database contains enzymes responsible for degrading carbohydrates and glycoconjugates. the lysm domain resides in the cbm <dig> peptidoglycan-binding module among the carbohydrate active enzymes , a category of enzymes that is able to break down or modify carbohydrate components  of plant cell walls  <cit> . cazymes are common in necrotrophic and saprophytic fungi and have important functions in establishing infection, making nutrients accessible for fungal growth  <cit> . we categorized the carbohydrate active enzymes encoded in the ag2-2iiib genome assembly according to the cazy database and found a large arsenal, in total  <dig> predicted plant cell wall-degrading enzymes . glycoside hydrolases are dominant  followed by carbohydrate esterases  and auxillary activity enzymes  . by comparing with r. solani ag1a, ag1-1b, ag <dig> and ag <dig> data , the ag2-2iiib genome has experienced an expansion and diversification of polysaccharide lyases . this notable enrichment was further accentuated in comparison to the genomes of u. maydis, and pythium ultimum, the latter an oomcyete pathogen on sugar beet. verticillium dahliae also features enriched numbers and composition of cazymes, which has been attributed to its broad host range  <cit> .fig.  <dig> cazy analysis in r. solani ag2-2iiib. a predicted r. solani ag2-2iiib genes encoding carbohydrate active enzymes as categorized within the cazy database. b distribution of cazymes predicted in the genomes of r. solani , ustilago maydis, pythium ultimum and verticillium dahliae




polysaccharides possess multiple functions in all organisms, and are essential components of cell walls of plants where they provide physical rigidity and protection against environmental constrains  <cit> . sugar moieties of pectic polysaccharides  account for more than 63 %  of the cell wall material present in sugar beet pulp, and approximately 70 % of the pectin consists of branched rhamnogalacturonans  <cit> . further, unlike most dicots, the chenopodiaceae comprise significant levels of ferulic acid in their primary walls . esterases hydrolyze ester bonds and ferulic acid esterases are known to act synergistically with xylanases and pectinases facilitating the access of hydrolases to the backbone of cell wall polymers. altogether, this could explain why carbohydrate esterases constitute a large proportion of the cazymes in ag2-2iiib. r. solani in general is known to have a broad host range, but whether occurrence of a particular set of cazy enzymes determines host range characteristics is still unknown. for example, could the less diverse set of cazymes encoded in the ag1-1a genome be explained by the fact that this fungal isolate originates from a monocot?

we further looked into the expanded group of polysaccharide lyases , glycoside hydrolases , and carbohydrate esterases , due to their abundance and particular distribution in ag2-2iiib compared to other r. solani genomes . a high number of pl <dig> proteins was observed in ag2-2iiib . phylogenetic analysis comprising  <dig> full length-pls from the pl <dig> group that is important for infection and widely distributed among fungi  <cit>  revealed seven clades whereof clade a, b, and f were ag2-2iiib-specific, with stronger support for clade a and f . elevated levels of the rsolag22iiib_ <dig> and rsolag22iiib_ <dig> genes  were found at the compatible interactions compared to control and exposure to the partial resistant genotypes  indicating a role of this enzyme in pathogenicity. in contrast, the rsolag22iiib_ <dig> gene, which was classified to clade b, was down-regulated compared to control samples . pl <dig> is common among other fungi of the phylum basidiomycota  <cit> , but is not present in r. solani or in the model basidiomycete species u. maydis, which only has one pl <dig> gene. u. maydis harbors few cazymes , whereof  <dig> are predicted to be associated with cell wall modifications  <cit> . during infection, plant cell wall components also can act as damage-associated molecular patterns that trigger plant defense responses  <cit> . thus, it is possible that specific cell wall degrading enzymes such as the enzyme encoded by rsolag22iiib_ <dig> is repressed to avoid initiating the plant defense response via release of cell wall fragments.fig.  <dig> comparison of cazyme families identified in rhizoctonia solani , ustilago maydis, pythium ulticum and verticillium dahliae. a polysaccharide lyases , b glysoside hydrolases  and c carbohydrate esterases 



glycoside hydrolases are known to catalyze hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds in carbohydrate molecules. to date,  <dig> gh families have been characterized, and we found that the gh <dig> family, comprising enzymes acting on pectin and hemicellulose as substrates, is more diverse in r. solani ag2-2iiib compared to other r. solani isolates . analysis of  <dig> full-length gh <dig> sequences from r. solani ag2-2iiib revealed that they are mainly classified in two clades, i and iii . we also found that three gh <dig> members are grouped in clade iv, while four enzymes were categorized in clade v . the transcription analysis revealed high expression of the rsolag22iiib_ <dig> gene during interactions with the partial resistant genotypes, whereas rsolag22iiib_ <dig> encoding a clade v enzyme, was constitutively expressed under our tested conditions .

as already outlined above, carbohydrate esterases  are enzymes involved in degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose. our analysis revealed an enrichment of ce <dig> proteins in ag2-2iiib . further, the members of the diverse ce <dig> group were categorized in three distinct clades a, b and c . again the transcription patterns of the ce <dig> genes, rsolag22iiib_ <dig> and rsolag22iiib_ <dig> gave ambiguous results . finally, distribution and composition of auxiliary activities , carbohydrate binding modules  and glycosyl transferases  in r. solani genomes and other soilborne pathogens on sugar beet are presented in additional file 10: figure s <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
the draft genome of r. solani ag2-2iiib encodes a high number of cell wall degrading enzymes. genes of these categories, which most likely reflects the saprophytic lifestyle of the genus rhizoctonia commonly feeds on dead organic matter of plant origin. the constantly growing genomic information on anastomosis groups and isolates of r. solani is an important step to generate better understanding of these important plant pathogens. development of efficient tools to enable functional analyses in this fungal genus is much awaited to support hypotheses developed from genome interpretation.
