BACKGROUND
mannose binding lectin  <cit> , a plasma protein of hepatic origin that belongs to the family of calcium-dependent collagenous lectins , is an important protein of the innate immune system  <cit> . this carbohydrate-binding protein binds mannose and n-acetylglucosamine  sugars and their derivates present on the surface of a wide range of clinically relevant microbial species and has the ability to distinguish self from nonself  <cit> .

mbl initiates the lectin pathway of complement using attached mannose binding lectin-associated serine proteases  in an antibody- and c1q-independent manner  <cit> . masp- <dig> is indistinguishable in specificity from the convertases found in the classical and alternative of complement activation and permits cleavage of c <dig> and c <dig> to form a c <dig> convertase  <cit> . once it has bound, mbl is able to deploy a variety of anti-microbial activities, such as microbial opsonization and/or microbial lysis via membrane attack complexes  <cit> . however, it is unclear whether mbl acts as a direct opsonin or is merely enhances other complement pathways and/or antibody-mediated phagocytosis  <cit> .

mbl deficiency, due to variation in the mbl gene, is one of the most common immunodeficiencies  <cit>  and is associated with impaired phagocytosis by polymorphonuclear leukocytes and with an increased burden of infections, especially in immunocompromised individuals  <cit> .

the clinically relevant opportunistic microorganism c. parapsilosis is now the second or third most common cause of systemic fungal infections after c. albicans  <cit> . it is especially prevalent in very low birth weight neonates, transplant patients, post-surgical patients, patients receiving intravenous hyperalimentation and patients with indwelling invasive devices  <cit> . most patients at risk have some degree of immunosuppression. mbl has been shown to play a role in the first-line defence against c. albicans  <cit> . the fungal cell wall, which consists mainly of polymers of n-acetylglucosamine , glucose  and mannose   <cit>  is a candidate ligand for mbl and may be capable of activating the lectin complement pathway.

in this study we evaluated the role of mbl in the opsonophagocytosis of c. parapsilosis. mbl was found to be a crucial opsonin for optimal phagocytosis of c. parapsilosis, c. albicans and acapsular c. neoformans. sera of patients with mbl deficiency have decreased opsonic capacity.

methods
microbial strains
a clinical isolate of candida parapsilosis strain 05– <dig> , as a reference candida albicans strain atcc  <dig> , the thinly  encapsulated cryptococcus neoformans strain nih  <dig>  and an acapsular mutant of c. neoformans, cap  <dig>  staphylococcus aureus mu  <dig> ), s. aureus kv  <dig> and kv  <dig> , escherichia coli atcc  <dig> and e. coli atcc  <dig>  were used. in addition, saccharomyces cerevisiae was used as a standard reference for the functional mbl test. isolates were stored at -80°c in 40% glycerol. before tests were performed, yeast strains were cultured overnight at 35°c on sabouraud dextrose agar  and bacterial strains were cultured overnight at 37°c on blood agar and then kept at 4°c.

binding of mbl
microorganisms  were incubated with  <dig> μg/ml of purified human mbl   in a total volume of  <dig> μl of veronal-buffered saline ph  <dig> , containing ca2+ and mg2+ plus  <dig> % bsa , on a shaking plate  at 37°c for  <dig> min. organisms were spun down for  <dig> min at  <dig> rpm and the pellets were washed with vsb2+ before suspension with mouse anti-mbl monoclonal antibody  . after a 30-min incubation on ice, samples were centrifuged and washed as described above and were resuspended in fitc-labelled goat anti mouse igg   and incubated on ice for  <dig> min. suspensions were centrifuged and washed as described above. samples were analyzed by flow cytometry  with measurement of mean fluorescence intensity . experiments were done in duplicate and repeated at least three times. negative controls were established for mbl binding by the omission of mbl. in order to evaluate whether the binding observed by c-type lectin interactions, inhibition experiments using a calcium chelating agent  <dig> mmol/l edta was added to the mbl solution  <dig> min before the addition of mbl to the microorganisms.

deposition of c <dig>  and c3b
mbl-deficient serum was obtained from a subject who was homozygous for the lypb haplotype of the mbl gene and had undetectable levels of serum mbl . serum igg was depleted from the mbl-deficient serum using a hitrap protein g column   <cit> . the freshly prepared mbl-deficient serum samples were aliqouted and stored at -70°c until use. informed consent was obtained from the donor.

microorganisms  were incubated in  <dig> μl hbs2+  containing 10% mbl-deficient serum supplemented with anti-c1q mab  to inhibit the classical pathway  <cit>  and with or without purified human mbl , in a sterile  <dig> well plate incubated for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> minutes at a shaking plate  at 37°c. the reaction in each well was stopped by adding  <dig> μl of ice-cold pbs. suspensions were washed and centrifuged for  <dig> min at  <dig> rpm. the supernatants were removed, and the pellets were suspended with  <dig> μl of a solution of murine monoclonal anti-human c4d  . after a 30-min incubation on ice, the samples were centrifuged and washed as described above and the pellets were resuspended in fitc-labelled goat anti-mouse igg   and were incubated on ice for  <dig> min. suspensions were centrifuged and washed as described above and measured by flow cytometry. c4d deposition was evaluated in duplicate and repeated at least three times.

c3b deposition was analyzed by incubation of the organisms with 10% mbl-deficient sera in hbs2+, after which surface-bound c3b was detected with fitc-conjugated  <dig> anti-human c <dig>  . detection of c3b deposition was the same as for deposition of c4d.

preparation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes
human polymorphonuclear  cells were isolated from the blood of healthy volunteers using a ficoll/histopaque gradient with sodium heparin as anticoagulant  as described previously  <cit> . in brief, heparinized blood was diluted with an equal volume of pbs , layered onto a gradient of ficoll-paque plus  and histopaque- <dig> , and centrifuged for  <dig> minutes at  <dig> × g. neutrophils were collected from the histopaque layer and washed with rpmi  <dig> containing  <dig> mm hepes , l-glutamine  and  <dig> % human serum albumin  . the neutrophils were then subjected to a hypotonic shock with water for  <dig> s to lyse remaining erythrocytes.

fluorometric phagocytosis assay
phagocytosis was performed using fluorescein isothiocyanate -labelled microorganisms, mbl-deficient serum and freshly isolated human neutrophils. in brief, organisms were mixed  with fitc   and incubated at 37°c for  <dig> h under constant shaking at  <dig> rpm. organisms were washed with rpmi  <dig> medium twice. for each separate experiment, organisms were cultured and labelled with fitc.

aliquots of fitc-labelled microorganisms  were transferred in 96-wells microtiter plates. the pellets were tumbled with 20% mbl-deficient serum in the presence of  <dig> μg/ml anti-c1q mab, with or without purified human mbl  and incubated for  <dig> min on a shaking plate at 37°c . the pellet of the pre-opsonised organisms was suspended in  <dig> μl of rpmi  <dig> and incubated with  <dig> μl purified pmns. phagocytosis was stopped after  <dig> min by addition of  <dig> μl ice cold rpmi  <dig> and the plate was centrifuged at 4°c at  <dig> rpm for  <dig> min. allophycocyanin -conjugated cd11b mab  served as a marker for human pmn  <cit>  for the phagocytosis of yeast. the pellet from each well was suspended in  <dig> μl  and was incubated at 4°c for  <dig> min, followed by the addition of  <dig> μl of rpmi  <dig> to each well and centrifugation at 4°c at  <dig> rpm for  <dig> min. the cell pellet was suspended in  <dig> μl rpmi  <dig> supplemented with 1% paraformaldehyde solution  and stored on ice for  <dig> min. analysis of the samples was performed with a flow cytometer. phagocytosis of the fitc-labelled microorganisms was evaluated by determining the proportion of labelled pmns expressed as a percentage of the total population of pmns. the maximum percentages, obtained within an experiment were assigned a value of 100% with all other percentages within the same experiment expressed as a relative percentage of this maximum. negative controls for opsonophagocytosis were established by incubating organisms in rpmi  <dig> containing neither serum nor purified human mbl in the opsonization step.

haemolytic mbl assay
a haemolytic mbl assay was used to study mbl activation by different microorganisms. this assay was previously described by kuipers et al  <cit>  and makes use of micro-organism-induced mbl activation in a dilution series of pooled human serum, followed by subsequent c5b-6-mediated bystander haemolysis of chicken erythrocytes. as a surplus of all down stream components of the lectin pathway are provided by a standardized concentration of mbl-deficient serum in this assay, the complement activation by bound mbl is the rate limiting step.

in brief, different microbial concentrations were added in  <dig> μl per well in a  <dig> well microtiter plate, and serially diluted in vertical rows . as the source of mbl, human pooled serum  from healthy workers of our laboratory was diluted 1: <dig> in vsb2+ and  <dig> μg/ml anti-c1q mab  <cit> , incubated on ice for  <dig> minutes, and then serially diluted  in vsb2+ . samples  of each dilution were tested for haemolytic activity, using chicken erythrocytes . the microtiter plates were placed in a water bath at 37°c for  <dig> h and then centrifuged for  <dig> min,  <dig> rpm. supernatant of each sample was transferred to a flat-bottom plate containing  <dig> μl super q per well. haemoglobin release was measured in an elisa reader at  <dig> nm. percentages of haemolysis were calculated using controls for 100%  and 0%  haemolysis. after incubation, the degree of bystander erythrocyte lysis was translated into the number of active sites per erythrocyte  using the equation of borsos and rapp  <cit> . titters were read at z =  <dig> . to measure the alternative pathway activation by the different microorganisms, the experiment s described above was performed with hps in egta-vb -n,n,n',n'-tetraacetic acit with  <dig>  mm mg 2+) preventing classical and lectin pathway activation by removing ca2+. direct haemolysis of the erythrocytes by microbial products was excluded by incubating microorganisms and erythrocytes together with mbl-deficient serum only. all experiments were repeated at least three times

statistical analysis
statistical significance was determined by unpaired student's t test, using graphpad software program . p values of <  <dig>  were considered to be statistically significant.

RESULTS
 <dig> . binding of mbl to different pathogens
a striking difference in binding patterns of mbl to the different microorganisms was found . binding of mbl to c. albicans, c. parapsilosis and in a lesser extend to acapsular c. neoformans was found. almost no binding of mbl was observed to s. aureus, e. coli and encapsulated c. neoformans. no binding was observed in the absence of ca2+  and when purified mbl was not added.

c <dig> and c3b deposition on the various pathogens
with c. albicans, c. parapsilosis and of acapsular c. neoformans deposition of the cleavages product c <dig> was detected after  <dig> min of incubation in mbl-deficient serum and was significantly enhanced by the addition of mbl at  <dig> min up to  <dig> min  . deposition of c <dig> was maximal at  <dig> min, whereas in the absence of mbl c <dig> deposition attained its maximal amount slowly over the time course measured. in contrast, addition of purified mbl to mbl-deficient serum did not increase c <dig> deposition significantly to the capsulated strains of c. neoformans, s. aureus and e. coli.

experiments with antibody to c3b  showed that the addition of purified human mbl enhanced the deposition of c3b on candida species and, to a lesser degree, c3b deposition on acapsular, encapsulated c. neoformans and s. aureus . with candida species, acapsular c. neoformans and s. aureus, c3b deposition was detected after  <dig> min of incubation in serum, with enhancement of deposition in the presence of mbl, reaching significance at  <dig> up to  <dig> min for c. albicans  and at  <dig> and  <dig> min for c. parapsilosis, acapsular c. neoformans and s. aureus . an increase in c3b deposition was observed for capsulated c. neoformans, reaching significance only at  <dig> min .

opsonophagocytosis of different pathogens
opsonophagocytosis of c. albicans and c. parapsilosis was enhanced by preincubation in the presence with purified mbl compared to preincubation with mbl-deficient serum alone, reaching significance at  <dig> % up to 20% serum for c. albicans  and at  <dig> % and 5% serum for c. parapsilosis  .

we noted less opsonophagocytosis in the presence with purified human mbl and the acapsular strain of c. neoformans compared to candida spp., although significance was reached at 10% and 20% serum . the capsulated strain of c. neoformans showed no opsonophagocytosis with or without adding purified human mbl. s. aureus and e. coli showed no opsonophagocytosis in the lowest concentration with or without adding purified human mbl. but mbl appears to play a role in the higher serum concentrations, reaching a significance at 20% serum for s. aureus . when downstream complement components were inactivated by heating at 56°c, opsonophagocytosis was eliminated under all conditions tested .

haemolytic assessment of complement activity via the lectin pathway
the haemolytic assay was used to characterize the different microorganisms as a weak or potent activator of the mbl arm of the complement system at a 1/ <dig> dilution of hps, since no activation of the alternative pathway was observed with this dilution . in this assay, the number of microbes and the mbl concentration were varied. addition of the inhibitory antibody directed against c1q eliminated the contribution of the classical pathway. the following organisms were ranked, in order of decreasing mbl-activating ability, s. cerevisiae, c. albicans, c. parapsilosis, encapsulated, and acapsular strain of c. neoformans and s. aureus and e. coli . the c. neoformans strains, s. aureus strains, e. coli strains did not activate mbl at this serum concentration.

discussion
mannose binding lectin , is a calcium-dependent plasma lectin that binds a wide range of microorganisms  <cit> . in the present study, we evaluated the role of binding of mbl at the subsequent deposition of c <dig> and c3b on the microbial cell wall. also the role of mbl in opsonophagocytosis by pmn was studied. well-characterized c. parapsilosis strain, c. albicans, e. coli, s. aureus and c. neoformans were used. these data demonstrate that mbl binds to c. parapsilosis, c. albicans and acapsular c. neoformans. mbl binding leads to activation of the lectin pathway of complement, demonstrated by deposition of c <dig> and c <dig> fragments and to enhanced opsonophagocytosis by pmns. mbl is an important opsonin for phagocytosis of candida species and acapsular c. neoformans. it lacks the function as an opsonin for phagocytosis of encapsulated c. neoformans. indeed, mbl plays a much less important role in the process of opsonisation of the s. aureus and e coli strains used. the lack of mbl activation of s. aureus, e. coli and c. neoformans could be advantageous to the organism in allowing it to remain hidden from the mbl arm of the complement system . serum mbl levels would be unlikely to influence these organisms colonization/infection, compared to the yeast, which are strong activators of the mbl arm of the complement system. these data suggest the importance of mbl in the first-line defence against candida species and acapsular c. neoformans.

previously, studies have shown that mbl binds with high avidity to c. albicans and c. parapsilosis as well as to encapsulated c. neoformans, through mannan, a major component of fungal cell walls  <cit> . microorganisms, as observed in the present study, fall into three groups. s. aureus, e. coli and encapsulated c. neoformans did not bind to mbl, acapsular c. neoformans bound mbl only weakly and both candida species showed strong mbl binding. mbl has recently been shown to bind to c. albicans via its lectin domain, resulting in fungi agglutination on their hyphea outgrowths  <cit> .

capsules have an important role in protecting organisms in vivo against complement attack, by making them resistant to phagocytosis  <cit> . the acapsular form of c. neoformans has exposed carbohydrate residues on its surface that are suitable for interaction with lectin-like receptors  <cit> . thus, the levels of mbl required for opsonophagocytosis may depend on the availability of binding epitopes on the infectious agents.

the opsonophagocytosis assay and the complement-deficient sera used in these experiments allowed us to measure mbl dependent opsonization, because the classical pathway was blocked with anti-c1q  <cit> . mbl increased the uptake of c. albicans, c. parapsilosis andacapsular c. neoformans by pmns in serum. since phagocytosis was not observed by binding of mbl in the absence of down-stream complement factors , phagocytosis was enhanced via c3b-dependent opsonization recognized by complement receptors on pmns. thus, mbl is an opsonin only in the presence of complement.

in contrast to our results, ip and lau  <cit> , using dendritic cells, reported that mbl binding does not lead to opsonophagocytosis, possibly due to the interference of mbl with the recognition of c. albicans by c-type receptors on dendritic cells, which mediate phagocytosis. neth et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that an mbl-mediated increases in opsonic c <dig> fragments enhanced opsonophagocytosis of s. aureus by neutrophils. however, cunnion et al.  <cit>  showed similar to us, that mbl-mediated complement activation, did not enhance s. aureus phagocytosis. they used hypo-γ-globulin serum, which had been affinity-depleted of mbl, whereas neth et al.  <cit>  used serum from adult individuals who were genetically deficient in mbl, but which could contain immunoglobulins. bacterial strain differences could account for the differences find in these reports  <cit> . comparable to our results with e. coli, previous experiments also have shown that mbl contributed little to opsonophagocytosis of gram-negative microorganisms  <cit> . recently, brouwer et al.  <cit>  reported mbl binding on the surface of s. pneumoniae, s. aureus and e. coli, but did not observe any significant contribution of mbl to opsonophagocytosis of these organisms. comparable to our results, brouwer et al.  <cit>  indicates that the lectin pathway of complement activation did not contribute to a large extent of the opsonophagocytosis of these bacteria.

also it was shown that in mbl transgenic mice mbl plays an important role in the innate immunity  <cit> . in contrast to our observations, shi et al.  <cit>  reported that mbl-initiated opsonophagocytosis by both neutrophils and macrophages is an important first-line host defence against s. aureus in mice. mice that do not have a functional mbl complement pathway are highly susceptible to infection with s. aureus. in that study, decreased phagocytosis of s. aureus by peritoneal macrophages in mbl-null mice was reported  <cit> . however, we only did in vitro studies, which may or may not explain the susceptibilities of mbl deficient individuals to these organisms. further studies are needed to define the role of mbl in the defence against these bacteria.

previously, it has shown, that neisseria meningitidis, the causative agent of meningococcal disease, is a strong activator of mbl  <cit> . this is in line with clinical studies, which showed that mbl is associated with an increased risk of mucosal acquired infections including meningococcal disease  <cit> . however, the role of mbl as an opsonin may thus critically depend on the microbial species involved, interspecies variation and the type of phagocytes present.

a number of clinical studies have reported that mbl deficiency predisposes to candida infections. recently, till et al.  <cit>  described that patients with peritonitis with an early abdominal yeast infection, most commonly caused by c. albicans and c. parapsilosis  <cit> , had lower mbl plasma levels than patients without such abdominal yeast infections. the incidence of abdominal yeast infections in patient with mbl variant genotype was significantly higher to those with no mbl variant genotype  <cit> .

mbl present in the vaginal cavity has been found to act as recognition molecules for c. albicans that colonize the cervicovaginal mucosa, which suggest that the lectin pathway plays an important role against candida infection  <cit> . low levels of vaginal mbl in patients with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis  might predispose to candida infections  <cit> . it has been proposed that mbl activity is critical in early life, when maternally acquired protection is decreasing and actively acquired immunity is still low  <cit> . mbl plasma concentrations at birth may be low due to both gene-polymorphisms and younger gestational age  <cit> . thus mbl activity may play an important role in innate defence of c. parapsilosis in premature babies.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the present study demonstrated the important role of mbl-mediated complement activation in opsonophagocytosis of c. parapsilosis, c. albicans and acapsular c. neoformans. mbl enhances opsonization of c. parapsilosis, c. albicans and acapsular c. neoformans, via the lectin pathway, which depends on the presence and availability of mbl binding epitopes. the binding of mbl by these yeasts and subsequent complement activation and opsonophagocytosis observed in our study may explain the observed increased risk of infections caused by these microorganisms in mbl-deficient individuals.
