BACKGROUND
chemokines dictate the migration and positioning of leukocytes at steady-state and in inflammation  <cit> . the chemokine cxcl <dig>  also known as stromal cell-derived factor-1α , is a member of the cxc chemokine subfamily and serves as the only known ligand for the chemokine receptor cxcr <dig> expressed on most leukocytes  <cit> . mice lacking cxcl <dig> or cxcr <dig> die perinatally of cardiovascular, neurologic, vascular, and hematopoietic defects  <cit> 

the cxcr <dig> receptor is a g-protein coupled receptor  and couples to heterotrimeric g-proteins of both the gαi and gαq-families  <cit> . members of the gαi-family of g-proteins are pertussis toxin sensitive and pre-treatment of cells with pertussis toxin severely attenuates chemotaxis in response to chemokines. gαi-proteins are therefore thought to be essential for chemokine-mediated migration. of the gαi-family, gαi <dig> and gαi <dig> are strongly expressed by lymphocytes  <cit> . gαi3-/- mice are without phenotype  <cit>  whereas gαi2-/- mice display dysfunctional t cell functions as well as defective chemotaxis in response to chemokines  <cit> . in contrast, gαq has been shown to be required for chemotaxis of dendritic cells and granulocytes, but not for t cells  <cit> .

stimulation of the t cell receptor , the b cell receptor, or the ly49d activating receptor all reduce lymphocyte migration toward cxcl <dig>  <cit>  suggesting that cells dedicated to proliferation/differentiation are less sensitive towards chemokines. the opposite is also true, as cells exposed to cxcl <dig> show less phosphorylation of zap- <dig> and lat following subsequent tcr activation indicating reciprocal regulation between cxcr <dig> and the tcr  <cit> . in addition, recruitment of chemokine receptors into the immunological synapse has been shown to stabilize t cell-apc interaction through activation of a gαq-dependent pathway. this renders the cell less responsive to chemotactic gradients and gives higher t cell proliferative responses and cytokine production  <cit> . recently, the tcr and cxcr <dig> were shown to closely associate upon cxcl12-stimulation  <cit> , and it was suggested that cxcr <dig> signaling occurs through the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif -domain present in the cd3ζ chain. collectively, these results point to a direct crosstalk between the signaling machineries utilized by the tcr and cxcr <dig> 

we have recently shown that gαq knockdown in t cells inhibits the activation of the src family kinase lck  <cit> . the effect of gαq on lck activation might be conferred by a direct interaction and/or by affecting the threshold for tcr-triggering. we demonstrate here that knockdown of gαq significantly enhances basal t cell migration while inhibiting tcr-induced lck activation. pre-treating cells with cxcl <dig> prior to stimulation with anti-cd <dig> leads to a similar inhibition of lck activation indicating that cells directed to migrate are less responsive to tcr triggering. the signals conveyed by gαq appear to be mediated through a shp- <dig> pathway. our data suggest that optimal tcr activation requires signaling through gαq, and that removal of gαq locks the cell in migration modus making the cell less responsive to tcr signaling

RESULTS
cxcl12-pretreatment attenuates tcr-induced lck activation comparable to the gαq-kd-kd phenotype
we have previously shown that sirna-mediated knockdown of the heterotrimeric g protein gαq in t cells attenuates tcr-induced lck activation  <cit> . while the tcr is not thought to be directly associated with g proteins, the chemokine receptor cxcr <dig> can couple to both gαq and gαi <dig>  furthermore, cxcr <dig> has been shown to associate with tcr upon cxcl <dig> activation  <cit> . activation of tyrosine kinases by gα-subunits has been demonstrated  <cit>  and could represent the mechanism by which cxcr <dig> activates lck  <cit> . we show here that the src family kinase inhibitor, pp <dig>  abrogated cxcl12-induced tyrosine-phosphorylation of several proteins , a further indication that src family kinases act downstream of cxcr <dig>  however, the changes in tyrosine phosphorylation following cxcl <dig> treatment are modest compared to those of anti-cd <dig> treatment . furthermore, pre-treatment of jurkat t cells with cxcl <dig> prior to stimulation with anti-cd <dig> attenuated tcr-induced lck activation . similarly, we also observed reduced zap- <dig> phosphorylation in cells pre-stimulated with cxcl <dig> . this is in line with a previous report showing reduced tcr-induced phosphorylation of zap- <dig> and lat in cxcl12-pretreated cells  <cit>  suggesting that post-activation heterologous desensitization is occurring possibly as a result of gαq sequestration. consistent with this notion surface expression of cxcr <dig> was also down after  <dig> minutes incubation with cxcl <dig>  to address the role of gα-subunits in controlling the switch between tcr and cxcr4-signaling events, we subjected jurkat t cells to sirnas against gαq or gαi <dig>  we achieved more than 90% knockdown with these sirnas as analysed by western blotting . as previously demonstrated  <cit>  tcr-induced lck y <dig> autophosphorylation was reduced in gαq-knockdown but not gαi2-knockdown t cells demonstrating that gαq may directly or indirectly activate lck .

gαq-kd sets the threshold for chemotaxis
the reciprocal regulation between the tcr and chemokine receptors  <cit>  suggest that the response to a specific chemokine is determined both by the differentiation and the activation state of the responding t cell. this implies that migrating t cells are less responsive to activation through the tcr. the physiological relevance of this switch between migration modus and tcr activation modus may be to ensure that migrating t cells do not get distracted by activation cues until they reach their destination. conversely, tcr triggered t cells are less responsive to chemotactic gradients to ensure optimal activation. we observed that knockdown of gαq enhanced basal migration 2-fold , suggesting that gαq may set the threshold for directed migration. this supports the findings of molon et al.  <cit>  who speculated that cxcr <dig> signaling through gαq promoted adhesion instead of migration. accordingly, we saw that knockdown of gαi <dig> inhibited directed cxcl12-induced migration, while gαq knockdown had no effect  confirming the notion that gαi <dig> is the principal gα-subunit involved in chemotaxis. the inhibitory effect of gαi <dig> knockdown could however be partly reversed with simultaneous knockdown of gαq . we speculate that the presence of gαq and absence of gαi <dig> may result in a combined strong inhibitory effect on chemotaxis. removal of gαq, will then lead to partial release of the inhibitory effect of gαi <dig> knockdown alone. although t cells from gαq-/- mice show no migrational defects  <cit> , data from knockout mice are difficult to interpret as compensatory mechanisms may have been established during development. acute knockdown with sirna provides an alternative method to examine protein functions. how cxcr <dig> switches its signaling through gαi <dig> and gαq is unknown, but the level of tcr engagement has been implicated  <cit> . surface expression of cxcr <dig> following cxcl12-stimulation was neither affected by knockdown of gαq nor gαi <dig> during a 1-hour time course . the level of surface expression of cd <dig> on jurkat tags has recently been reported  <cit> . furthermore, we suggest that neither ca2+-elevation nor erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation are involved in chemotaxis as has been suggested in a previous report  <cit> . while elevation of intracellular ca2+ was abrogated in the gαq-knockdown cells upon cxcr4-stimulation , it was intact in gαi2-knockdown cells. the level of erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation was similar in both gαq-knockdown and gαi2-knockdown jurkat cells. however, concomitant knockdown of both gαq and gαi <dig> completely attenuated erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation , indicating that this is a g-protein dependent event.

the gαi2-kd-signaling pathway dominates the cxcl12-induced migrational response
to test whether the gαi2-signaling pathway is the principal pathway activated by cxcr <dig> we pre-treated cells with the pi3k inhibitor wortmannin prior to incubation with cxcl <dig>  in the presence of wortmannin cxcl12-induced migration was strongly inhibited . furthermore, in the presence of wortmannin the gαq-kd cells displayed an approximately 80% increase in cxcl12-induced migration . this suggests that the negative regulatory effect of gαq on migration is normally not observed when the gαi <dig> signaling pathway through pi3k is intact, and that a switch from gαi <dig> to gαq is necessary to fully inhibit migration. these observations correlate well with the data showing that co-knockdown of gαq and gαi <dig> has a smaller inhibitory effect on migration than knockdown of gαi <dig> alone . although the presence of lck is shown to be necessary for migration  <cit>  activating lck through the tcr receptor has an inhibitory effect on migration  <cit> . consistent with these findings cells transfected with the constitutively active lck y505f showed a significant inhibition of migration compared to vector-transfected cells . interestingly, the effect of gαq-kd on wortmannin-treated t cells in the presence of cxcl <dig> is reversed when transfected with lck y505f indicating that the effect of gαq is mediated through lck .

gαq-kd inhibits migration through activation of shp-1
src homology phosphatase- <dig>  is an lck-activated tyrosine phosphatase reported to negatively regulate cxcl12-induced migration  <cit> . as we have recently reported that gαq may activate lck we examined how gαq manipulation would affect shp- <dig> regulation in migration. knockdown of gαq resulted in decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of shp- <dig> compared to control cells . this may indicate a role for gαq in the activation of shp- <dig>  interestingly, increased basal phosphorylation of shp- <dig> was observed in gαi <dig> knockdown cells. this may be due to skewing of the cxcr <dig> signaling pathway towards gαq as there is less gαi <dig> available. conversely, knockdown of gαq might skew the cxcr <dig> signaling pathway towards gαi <dig>  to assess the role of shp- <dig> in chemotaxis we transfected jurkat t cells with the phosphatase-deficient, mutant shp- <dig> c453s  that competes with endogenous shp- <dig>  cells transfected with the mutant showed significantly increased basal and cxcl <dig> induced migration compared to control cells indicating that an lck-gαq-shp- <dig> pathway may regulate migration . migration is probably not exclusively regulated by shp- <dig> and other negative regulators of migration activated by gαq-kd might exist.

CONCLUSIONS
we have previously shown that knockdown of gαq attenuates tcr-induced lck activation by an unknown mechanism  <cit> . while gαi <dig> has a positive role in inducing migration, gαq may have a negative regulatory role by promoting lck activity resulting in increased shp- <dig> activity . previous reports have demonstrated a reciprocal regulation between the tcr and chemokine-receptors  <cit> . based on our recent report, an optimal tcr-triggering may require the gαq signaling pathway as gαq knockdown attenuates tcr-induced lck activation  <cit> . in contrast, gαq knockdown appears to release migration from tonic inhibition. this is in line with data showing increased proliferation and cytokine-production when chemokine-receptors signal through gαq  <cit>  suggesting that a switch from gαi <dig> to gαq through the chemokine-receptor promotes t cell activation rather than migration. in conclusion, we suggest that gαq activation strengthens the commitment of t cells to activation through the tcr while gαi <dig> activation commits the t cell to migration. this might contribute to ensure that t cells migrating towards a site of infection do not get distracted by unnecessary activation cues, while activated t cells are fully committed towards differentiation and proliferation.
