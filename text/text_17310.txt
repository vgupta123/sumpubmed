BACKGROUND
the vertebral column develops from somites  is derived from sclerotome and provides the structural properties of the ivd. as the vertebral bodies undergo chondrogenesis, notochord cells are removed from the vertebral region and expand into the ivd region to initially form the nucleus pulposus , the central portion of the ivd  <cit> . tgf-β <dig> is one of the earliest markers of the developing ivd within the sclerotome  <cit> .

members of the tgf-β superfamily are secreted signaling molecules that regulate many aspects of cell physiology , the activins and inhibins, growth and differentiation factors , and the bone morphogenetic proteins . tgf-βs signal through heteromeric serine/threonine kinase receptors. the current model is that tgf-β binds to the tgf-β type ii receptor  on the cell surface  <cit> . tgfbr <dig> is then able to recruit the type i receptor  to form a heterotetrameric complex. tgfbr <dig> which is a constitutively active kinase, phosphorylates the type i receptor, activating the type i serine/threonine kinase. downstream targets of tgfbr <dig> then transduce the signal to the nucleus.

all three isoforms of tgf-β are expressed in the developing mouse axial skeleton in distinct and overlapping patterns  <cit> . tgfb <dig> mrna is localized to intersegmental cells at e <dig>  days. by e <dig>  days, tgfb <dig> mrna is localized to the ossification centers and perichondrium of vertebrae. at e <dig>  days, tgfb <dig> mrna is expressed in all prevertebral segments with the highest levels of expression in the thoracic sclerotome. tgfb <dig> mrna is also expressed in all prevertebral segments marking the location of the future ivd and later becoming restricted to the perichondrium and outer af of the ivd  <cit> . a systematic study of the expression pattern of the tgf-β receptors during mouse vertebral development has not been reported; however, expression has been detected in the somite and ivd  <cit> . tgfbr <dig> is expressed in the adult af. a decrease in expression is correlated with aging and degeneration of the ivd  <cit> .

the role and necessity of members of the tgf-β superfamily in specific aspects of spinal development and pathology is most clearly illustrated in mice and humans with mutations or targeted deletions in their respective genes  <cit> . previously, we showed that deletion of tgfbr <dig> in col2a expressing sclerotome resulted in defects in development of the vertebrae and the ivd  <cit> . specifically, alterations in the af were detected. the boundary between the ivd and vertebral body was not clearly demarcated and fibromodulin  expression was reduced while expression of type ii collagen splice variant b  and staining with peanut agglutinin were increased. the results suggested that tgf-β was required to promote and/or maintain the ivd during development. tgf-β also appears to have a role in maintaining the adult ivd. polymorphisms within the human tgfb <dig> gene have a weak but significant association with ankylosing spondylitis and the t29c polymorphism in the tgfb <dig> gene is associated with the genetic susceptibility to spinal osteophytosis  <cit> . furthermore, a functional snp in cartilage intermediate layer protein  is associated with lumbar disc disease. clip was shown to co-localize with tgf-β in the ivd and the susceptibility-associated allele showed increased binding to tgf-β and inhibited tgf-β signaling  <cit> .

very little is known about the molecular mechanisms that govern development of the ivd. one of the barriers to understanding how the ivd develops is a lack of markers to distinguish developing ivd from the cartilage of the vertebrae. in this study, we used laser microdissection and microarray technology to identify genes whose expression was enriched in the developing ivd relative to the adjacent vertebrae. we then used clustering analysis of gene expression profiles in mutant and control vertebrae and ivd to show that in the absence of tgfbr <dig>  ivd molecularly starts to resemble vertebrae. we then show that treatment of sclerotome with tgf-β results in up-regulation of many ivd enriched genes. together the data suggest that tgf-β prevents chondrocyte differentiation in the presumptive ivd and promotes differentiation of the af from sclerotome.

RESULTS
identification of ivd enriched genes
to identify genes that are enriched in the presumptive ivd relative to the presumptive vertebral body, we used laser capture microdissection followed by microarray analysis. rna was collected from ivd and vertebrae that were microdissected from the lumbar region of e <dig>  day mouse embryos . at this stage, we could just begin to distinguish the presumptive ivd from the adjacent developing cartilage. in addition, the notochord was just beginning to expand into the presumptive ivd region. microscopically, ivd samples that were collected contained primarily presumptive af tissue with only a small amount of notochord/np. tissue was microdissected from several separate cre-negative and cre+tgfbr2loxp/loxp embryos. after isolation and quality control testing of the rna we had  <dig> biological replicates from cre-negative ivd and vertebrae and tgfbr <dig> mutant vertebrae. we had four biological replicates of tgfbr <dig> mutant ivd. each sample was amplified and labelled separately then hybridized to affymetrix mouse  <dig>  <dig>  genechip arrays .

lists of presumptive ivd and vertebrae-enriched genes were generated by comparing gene expression in wild type  ivd and vertebrae . a total of  <dig> genes were found enriched in the ivd , that is, after normalization and application of statistical cut offs , expression of these genes was 2-fold higher in the ivd than in the vertebrae. one hundred and forty one vertebrae enriched genes were identified . genes whose preferential expression in the ivd was verified either by literature/database search or in situ hybridization  are shown in table  <dig>  the gene expression databases searched were the gene expression database  at mouse genome informatics  and the genepaint database  a digoxigenin labelled probe to nfatc <dig> was hybridized to sections from e <dig>  day embryos. hybridization was visualized as purple staining. nfatc <dig> was clearly expressed in the ivd  at this stage.  a digoxigenin labelled probe to ebfa <dig> was hybridized to sections from e <dig>  day embryos. expression was not detected in the ivd  but light purple staining was seen in the vertebral body . staining was also seen in the neural tube  and adjacent blood vessels.

effects of losing tgfbr <dig> on ivd development
previously, we generated mice in which tgfbr <dig> was deleted using cre expressed under the control of the col2a promoter. the mice had defects in development of the ivd  <cit> . specifically, the expression of fmod, an ivd marker, was reduced and expression of cartilage markers was increased suggesting one of the roles of tgfbr <dig> is to prevent chondrocyte differentiation in the af of the presumptive ivd. here, we used microarray analysis to compare molecular profiles of normal and mutant ivd to see if we could confirm and extend the previous findings. two hundred and eleven genes were found to be either up-regulated or down-regulated in the e <dig>  presumptive ivd after deletion of tgfbr <dig> . several of the ivd markers that were identified in table  <dig> and additional file 1: supplemental table s <dig> were down-regulated in the mutant ivd relative to the controls . likewise, several genes normally enriched in the vertebrae  were up-regulated in the tgfbr2-mutant ivd . we confirmed the previous results showing down-regulation of fmod in the mutant ivd and extended this finding to show down-regulation of other ecm ivd enriched genes including col <dig> and col <dig>  asporin , which has been associated with lumbar disc disease in humans  <cit> , was down-regulated in mutant ivd. trps <dig>  a transcription factor associated with the skeletal defects of trichorhinophalangeal syndrome  <cit> , was also down-regulated in mutant ivd.

a more global analysis of differences in normal and mutant ivd was provided by gene ontology  analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis. first go analysis indicated that mutations in tgfbr <dig> resulted in significant alterations in the ivd in genes associated with development of multicellular organisms, which also included a subset of genes associated with limb development. there are no specific go terms to define development in the axial skeleton. genes associated with patterning and cell adhesion were also altered. hierarchical clustering was used to sort three lists of genes with the go terms multicellular organism development, pattern specification, and cell adhesion . this analysis clusters conditions that are molecularly most similar together. when genes under the general term of multicellular organism development were used for the cluster analysis, wild type and mutant vertebrae sorted closest together indicating that overall they were molecularly very similar. mutant ivd clustered closer to the vertebrae samples . similar results were obtained for genes under the go term pattern specification . in contrast, if the experiment was clustered based on cell adhesion related genes, both ivd and vertebrae were affected so that wild type and mutant ivd did not cluster together and wild type and mutant vertebrae did not cluster together either . the results support the model in which development and patterning is altered in tgfbr2-mutant ivd so that it more closely resembles vertebrae than normal ivd.

tgf-β treated sclerotome preferentially expresses ivd enriched genes
next, we wanted to find genes that were potentially directly regulated by tgf-β in sclerotome and determine if tgf-β treated sclerotome acquired characteristics of ivd. to this end, we set up micromass cultures of sclerotome cells dissected from e <dig>  day wild type embryos . this culture system is similar to that commonly used for embryonic limb mesenchyme  <cit> . to determine if there was contamination from other cell layers, for example the myotome, we isolated rna from the freshly dissected sclerotome as well as the notochord, and neural tube that were left after the dissection. marker gene expression was used to determine the quality of the dissection . pax <dig> is expressed in sclerotome  <cit> , pax <dig> is expressed in the myotome and in the dorsal neural tube  <cit> , and brachyury  is expressed in the notochord  <cit> . in the sclerotome sample, pax <dig> was expressed at a high level, as expected. there was little to no expression of pax <dig> indicating very little myotome or neural tube contamination in the dissected tissue. the very low level of expression of pax <dig> in the notochord and neural tube samples indicates that a small amount of sclerotome was left behind during the dissection.

cultures were grown in absence of growth factors or in the presence of  <dig> ng bmp4/ml or  <dig> ng tgf-β1/ml. after  <dig> hours in culture, cells were stained with alcian blue . cells grown in the absence of growth factors demonstrated a low number of alcian blue stained nodules with similar morphology to the cartilage nodules found in cultures of limb mesenchyme. as expected, treatment with bmp <dig> resulted in an increase in the number of alcian blue stained nodules with cartilage morphology  <cit> . treatment with tgf-β resulted in a different response. alcian blue staining was present throughout the entire culture but not in discreet nodules. previously, it was shown that c3h10t1/ <dig> cells, immortalized mesenchymal cells, treated with tgf-β demonstrate a similar response  <cit> . furthermore, treatment with tgf-β resulted in increased levels of fmod mrna, a previously known marker for ivd .

since the tgf-β treated micromass cultures expressed fmod and did not demonstrate typical cartilage morphology, we next used microarray analysis to test the hypothesis that tgf-β could promote af differentiation from sclerotome cells. sclerotome cultures were set up and left untreated or treated with  <dig> ng tgf-β1/ml or  <dig> ng bmp4/ml for  <dig> hours at which time rna was extracted. the experiment was set up three separate times so that we would have three biological replicates of each condition. after quality control testing of the rna, each sample was amplified and labelled separately then hybridized to affymetrix mouse  <dig>  <dig>  genechip arrays .

gene list for tgf-β regulated and bmp regulated genes were generated . after normalization and statistical analysis,  <dig> genes that were either  <dig> fold up- or down-regulated by tgf-β were identified . four hundred and forty eight bmp regulated genes were identified . many known cartilage markers including sox <dig>  sox <dig>  sox  <dig>  and aggrecan , were up-regulated by bmp . in contrast, tgf-β did not up-regulate any of these known cartilage markers. instead, treatment with tgf-β up-regulated many genes that were enriched in the developing ivd, including fmod and adamtls <dig> . it is also interesting to note that many vertebrae enriched genes were down-regulated by tgf-β including maf, a protein known to interact with sox <dig> to regulate cartilage gene expression  <cit> . in addition, at least two tendon markers, scx and mkx, were regulated by tgf-β. it was recently shown that tgf-β is also required for normal tendon development  <cit> . semiquantitative rt-pcr  and real time pcr  were used to verify regulation by tgf-β of a subset of genes. as seen in the array data, tgf-β up-regulated adamtsl <dig> as well as the transcription factors bhlhbe <dig>  erg, mkx, nfatc <dig>  and scx. tgf-β treatment resulted in down regulation of the transcription factors ebf <dig> and maf.

scatterplot analysis was used to give a more global analysis of the molecular profile of tgf-β treated sclerotome . first, the list of tgf-β up-regulated genes was superimposed on the experiments describing differential expression of genes in the wild type ivd versus the wild type vertebrae . in this plot, genes preferentially expressed in the ivd are represented as dots below the center line, with high significance of difference below the outer line. overall the genes that are up-regulated by tgf-β were skewed toward expression in the ivd supporting the hypothesis that tgf-β can promote ivd phenotype at the molecular level. next, the list of genes that are preferentially expressed in the ivd was superimposed on the experiment describing genes that are regulated by tgf-β in sclerotome . in this case, dots above the center line represent genes that are up-regulated by tgf-β and genes below the line are down-regulated by tgf-β. there were more genes in the ivd that were up-regulated than down-regulated by tgf-β. in contrast, if the list of genes that is preferentially expressed in the vertebrae is superimposed on the experiment describing genes that are regulated by tgf-β, genes that are down-regulated by tgf-β predominate. together the results suggest that tgf-β supports differentiation of ivd from sclerotome.

discussion
in this study we used microarray analysis to begin to address the mechanism of tgf-β action in development of the axial skeleton. first, we identified a list of ivd enriched genes that can be used as markers to distinguish developing ivd from the adjacent vertebrae. we also identified a number of genes for which expression is altered in control ivd versus tgfbr2-deleted ivd. go analysis indicated that genes associated with development of multicellular organisms, patterning, and adhesion were altered by the loss of tgfbr <dig> in the presumptive ivd. hierarchical clustering analysis indicated that at the molecular level, tgfbr <dig> mutant ivd more closely resembled vertebrae than control ivd. the results suggest that tgfbr <dig> is required to prevent cartilage formation in the presumptive ivd. we then showed that a number of ivd enriched genes are up-regulated by tgf-β in cultured sclerotome whereas vertebrae enriched genes tended to be down-regulated by tgf-β. the results suggest that tgf-β can also promote differentiation of ivd  from sclerotome.

one outcome of the molecular profiling described here is a list of genes that can be used as markers for developing ivd. it was shown previously that tgfb <dig> is one of the earlier markers to denote where the future ivd will form within the sclerotome  <cit> . in addition, we and others have previously used fmod as a marker for the developing ivd af  <cit> . both of these known markers were identified as ivd enriched genes in the screen described here. in addition, the list of markers can be expanded to include gdf <dig> and wnt9a, which are also expressed in the interzone of developing synovial joints  <cit> . furthermore, several disease-related genes were identified as enriched in the ivd. these include adamtsl <dig>  aspn, and trps <dig>  adamtsl <dig> is associated with geleophysic dysplasia . patients with geleophysic dysplasia present with a variety of skeletal abnormalities. it was also recently shown that adamtsl <dig> regulates the bioavailabilty of tgf-β resulting in increased tgf-β activity in fibroblasts from geleophysic dysplasia patients  <cit> . polymorphisms in asp, like cilp, which is regulated by tgf-β, are associated with lumbar disc disease . both aspn and clip are extracellular matrix proteins that bind to tgf-β and suppresses its activity  <cit> . the d <dig> allele of aspn is associated with both osteoarthritis and lumbar disc disease and inhibits tgf-β activity to a greater extent than other alleles  <cit> . trichorhinophalangeal syndrome, type i  is caused by haploinsuffiency in the transcription factor trps <dig>  patients have distinctive craniofacial and skeletal abnormalities. it is not known how trps <dig> might regulate development in the axial skeleton  <cit> .

gene ontology  analysis of the genes that were regulated in control versus mutant ivd allowed us to determine biological processes that might be altered by loss of tgfbr <dig>  eleven go terms were represented at a significant level in the control versus mutant ivd gene list. the  <dig> terms could be broadly divided into three categories: multicellular organism development, patterning, and adhesion. previously we showed that tgfbr <dig> is required for normal development of the ivd  <cit> . using pax <dig> and pax <dig> as markers of rostral-caudal patterning within the sclerotome we also showed that this patterning was disrupted in tgfbr <dig> mutant mice  <cit> . the list of patterning genes altered by loss of tgfbr <dig> is extended in this analysis. we did not previously address alterations in adhesion due to loss of tgfbr <dig> in the axial skeleton. the profiling presented here suggests that this would be a logical avenue for future experiments to understand the mechanism of tgfbr <dig> action in the development of the axial skeleton and specifically in development of the ivd.

hierarchical clustering analysis using a list of genes broadly associated with development indicated that by e <dig>  days at the molecular level, mutant ivd more closely resembled vertebrae than control ivd. we previously showed that cartilage fills the presumptive ivd space in mutant mice by e <dig>  days suggesting that one of the roles of tgf-β in the axial skeleton is to prevent chondrogenic differentiation in the presumptive ivd  <cit> . more recently, we showed that tgfbr <dig> also acts to limit chondrogenesis in limb mesenchyme grown in micromass culture  <cit> . limb mesenchyme from mice with targeted deletion of tgfbr <dig> via prx1-cre recombination grown in micromass culture consistently demonstrated an increase in the number of cartilage nodules with increased levels of alcian blue staining relative to untreated cells from control limbs suggesting tgf-β limits the formation of cartilage from mesenchymal cells. the prx1cre; tgfbr2lox/lox mice also demonstrated a failure to maintain the interzone during development of the joints in the digits. the presumptive interzone was replaced with cartilage resulting in fusion of the synovial joints in the digits. overall, the data suggest that tgf-β is anti-chondrogenic in limb and sclerotome mesenchyme, allowing development of the synovial and axial joints. the early development of the growth plate of the long bones and vertebral bodies was surprisingly normal in these mice suggesting tgf-β is not required for early development of these structures as previously suspected  <cit> . the effects of tgf-β on mature permanent cartilages, like the articular cartilage, are distinct in that tgf-β appears to maintain the cartilage phenotype and prevent hypertrophic differentiation in these tissues  <cit> . it is known that the response of a cell to tgf-β is dependent on its differentiation status  <cit> .

to identify genes that are potentially involved in the anti-chondrogenic activity of tgf-β, we can compare the lists of vertebrae enriched genes, genes that are up- regulated in the ivd by loss of tgbr <dig> in vivo and genes that are directly down- regulated by tgf-β in sclerotome grown in culture. for example, one transcription factor, ebf <dig>  meets all three of these criteria. here we showed using in situ hybridization that ebf <dig> is expressed at a low level in the presumptive vertebrae as early as e <dig>  days. nothing is known about the role of this factor in development of the axial skeleton; however, it was recently shown that ebf <dig> is expressed in cells of the osteoblast lineage and controls osteoblast differentiation  <cit> . ebf1-null mice are runted but have an increase in the number of osteoblasts in the bone. we can propose a testable model in which ebf <dig> is expressed in the developing vertebrae and is normally down-regulated by tgf-β in the ivd. in the absence of tgf-β, ebf <dig> is up-regulated in the ivd region promoting vertebral development. likewise, another transcription factor, maf, is down-regulated by tgf-β in cultured sclerotome and up-regulated in mutant ivd relative to control ivd. maf was previously shown to cooperate with sox <dig> to regulate many cartilage-enriched genes  <cit> . it is possible that down-regulation of maf by tgf-β is at least partially responsible for its antichondrogenic activity.

based on results from overlaying lists of genes that are up-regulated by tgf-β with genes that are enriched in the ivd we propose that tgf-β can also promote formation of ivd af from sclerotome. previous studies have also shown that adult marrow stromal cells treated with tgf-β more closely resemble ivd than cartilage based on the expression of a smaller set of molecular markers  <cit> . more recently, it was suggested that tgf-β can either promote cartilage differentiation or shift mesenchymal cell differentiation from a chondrogenic to a fibrous  fate depending on the presence of tgif <dig> and down-regulation of sox <dig>  <cit> . neither expression of sox <dig> or tgif <dig> were affected by tgf-β in either the cell culture or in vivo experiments performed here suggesting additional modes of regulation exist. we can generate hypotheses about how tgf-β promotes ivd development by comparison of genes that are enriched in the ivd, down-regulated in the mutant ivd, and up-regulated by tgf-β in culture. for example, the transcription factor, erg, meets all three criteria. it was previously shown that mouse erg is preferentially expressed in the developing interzone and in the presumptive ivd  <cit> . over-expression of erg in mice using the col2a promoter resulted in a delay in hypertrophic differentiation in the long bones. furthermore, tenascin c expression, a marker for articular cartilage, was expanded. it was suggested that the function of erg was to promote the formation of permanent cartilage. the effects of erg in the axial skeleton were not addressed but we can propose a testable model in which tgf-β regulates expression of erg, which in turn could promote formation of the fibrocartilage of the ivd.

CONCLUSIONS
based on the molecular profiling described here, we propose that tgf-β has two functions in development of the af in the ivd: 1) to prevent chondrocyte differentiation in the presumptive ivd space and 2) to promote differentiation of af from sclerotome. we have identified genes that are enriched in the ivd and regulated by tgf-β that warrant further investigation as important regulators of ivd development.
