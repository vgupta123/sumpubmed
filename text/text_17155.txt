BACKGROUND
color polymorphism is strongly correlated with the distribution of a species, its ecological niche width, as well as its genetic diversity. indeed, color polymorphic species exhibit larger distributions, can use wider niches, and are genetically more diverse than monomorphic species  <cit> . in addition, polymorphic species seems to be more resilient to environmental modifications, an advantage which could have a non-negligible effect on their long-term survival . such correlations may explain the numerous implications of coloration in processes of prey-predator interactions , thermoregulation, and behavior .

particular coloration can confer advantages in specific conditions. for example, the occurrence of melanistic morphs in ectothermic vertebrates such as reptiles, has been documented in a large number of species, obviously for thermoregulatory reasons . in cold conditions, melanistic reptiles are able to increase their temperature faster than non-melanistic individuals of the same species, thus providing multiple advantages in terms of reproductive output, growth rate, survival or length of the activity period  <cit> . however, such benefits could be counterbalanced by a reduced level of crypsis or a lack of aposematic signaling. therefore, melanistic individuals might experience a higher predation rate , possibly leading to increased stress and decreased foraging efficiency, which in turn could negatively impact their body condition . in addition, it may also indirectly affect the dispersal capacity of this morph, as non-cryptic dispersing individuals are more likely to be predated and never reach new habitats, leading to a color-biased dispersal. few cases are known in which dispersal behaviors are color-specific, independently of the survival rate of dispersing individuals. for example, recent field studies focusing on the barn owl  have shown that darker individuals disperse farther than paler individuals  <cit> . similarly, saino et al.,  <cit>  found that barn swallow  darker males were more likely to disperse. such color-biased dispersals might deeply affect the population genetic structure of a species and its capacity to colonize new habitats, and might be partly associated to local diversifying selection.

for these reasons, particular color morphs may be under strong selection in a given habitat type. in order to test such a selection, an effective method is to compare color variation with the genetic differentiation  of different populations to contrast the degree of adaptive variation and the degree of differentiation due to potential genetic drift  <cit> . the genetic divergence of neutral loci can serve as null-hypothesis to test against the adaptive divergence as an alternative  <cit> .

an appropriate model system to study this type of selection, and thus the evolution of color polymorphism, is the asp viper , which displays a high level of color variation in a large part of its distribution area . blotched or zigzag morphs are common throughout v. aspis range; it is believed that these patterns have a cryptic function in european vipers, but also, once detected, reveal an aposematic signal to predators such as raptors  <cit> ; figure 1). in addition, a melanistic morph is frequently found in montane populations, particularly in the swiss alps, likely for thermoregulatory benefits  <cit> . beside these two morphs, atypical non-blotched individuals  are found in high proportions in the french alps , whereas this morph is rarely encountered in other regions and never in such proportions  <cit> ). the adaptive function of this atypical coloration remains enigmatic, however the center of the area where non-blotched individuals are found in high frequencies is less wooded  than its periphery, even at elevations as low as  <dig> m above sea level . the principal aim of this study is to bring new insight into the presence of a large number of individuals with an atypical coloration in central europe , by studying  the genetic structure of these populations using nine microsatellite markers, and testing for  a potential local diversifying selection and  differences in dispersal capacity between blotched and non-blotched individuals.figure  <dig> examples of the color polymorphism present in two male asp vipers .



RESULTS

following the method of evanno et al.  <cit> , the software structure revealed two clusters within our dataset. individuals of populations 1- <dig> mainly belonged to the first cluster, whereas individuals of populations 5- <dig> were more frequently assigned to the second cluster . interestingly, populations of the first cluster are also those exhibiting the highest proportion of non-blotched individuals  and have a central geographical distribution compared to the other sampled populations .figure  <dig> summary plot of the individual assignment results of the structure analyses .



the bayesass analysis suggested that recent exchange of migrants occurred between some populations, with a maximum value of m =  <dig>   from population  <dig> into  <dig>  in addition, the evaluation of gene flow revealed that it was asymmetrical between most populations .

color and sex-biased dispersal analyses
considering individuals from all or strictly color polymorphic populations , we found significant differences  between the maic of non-blotched  and blotched individuals , the latter having lower maic values, meaning that blotched individuals are dispersing the most. in addition, we found no significant differences between sexes overall , as well as within non-blotched individuals . however, sex biased dispersal was significant within blotched individuals, with females dispersing more than males .figure  <dig> mean assignment index correction  values for blotched and non-blotched snakes considering all  or strictly polymorphic populations .



pst vs fst
the mean pst values for the color trait were  <dig>  when estimated with fstat, or  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  when estimated with various level of potential heritability, i.e.  <dig>   <dig> , and  <dig>  respectively. all pst values were higher than the empirical 95th percentile of the pairwise fst distribution  and hence were considered as extreme, meaning that the coloration differentiations between populations might evolve by selection and not by neutral processes. the wilcoxon signed rank tests revealed that there are significant difference between pst calculated with fstat , and with heritabilities of  <dig>   and  <dig>  , but not when the heritability was set at  <dig> .

discussion
our genetic analyses revealed a local diversifying selection and a color-biased dispersal . the combination of these results has several implications.

it is not known if non-blotched individuals are more frequently attacked by their predators  than blotched individuals, in contrast to melanistic individuals  <cit> , but the results of the present study attest the occurrence of selection for the uniformly colored phenotype, which is common only in the centre of the studied area . thus, we hypothesize that this phenotype has a local cryptic function and is consequently better adapted to its habitat, which is less wooded, respectively more open than surrounding areas and characterized by light-colored stones. indeed, several birds of prey occur in our study area, such as the short-toed snake eagle , which is a specific snake predator and can have a strong impact on viper populations  <cit> .

an alternative scenario explaining the observed results would be selection against the non-blotched phenotype outside the core region and no selection within it. the results obtained in this study are also in agreement with this hypothesis. indeed, the maics of blotched individuals were lower than those of non-blotched individuals, meaning than these latter may be poor dispersers, or that non-blotched dispersers may be unable to survive out of their restricted geographical range. based on our investigation, it is currently impossible to untangle these two hypotheses. however, mark-recapture and telemetry studies should provide helpful information concerning potential differences in the dispersal capacities of the different color morphs. moreover, studying the predation rate of color polymorphic decoys could highlight differences in detectability between color morphs.

furthermore, we cannot exclude that the observed pattern might be due to a recent range expansion  of asp vipers in the study area. such event could result in a low genetic structure and in a non-random distribution of the different color morphs, as observed in this study. nevertheless, given  the lack of differences in the genetic diversity  between monomorphic and polymorphic populations,  the particularity of the habitat where non-blotched snakes are found and  the observed differences in dispersal capacity between blotched and non-blotched individuals , a scenario involving a diversifying selection is more likely.

in a more general context, this atypical coloration, showing a lack of blotched or zigzag patterns on the dorsum of individuals, has been described in other viperids such as the seoane’s viper , meadow viper  or latifi’s viper , but its impact on individuals is still unknown. however, several studies focusing on colubrid snakes and a species of salamander highlighted behavioral differences between color morphs in term of aggressiveness and predator avoidance strategies .

the few studies focusing on color variation and the genetic structure of populations all showed that diversifying selection occurred. for example, manier et al.  <cit>  detected diversifying selection of different ecotypes of garter snake thamnophis elegans . cox & rabosky  <cit>  found that strong selection promotes color polymorphism across spatial and temporal scales in the highly polymorphic ground snake . in birds, antoniazza et al.  <cit>  found that local adaptation maintains clinal variation in melanin-based coloration of european barn owls . in addition, the analyses of contact zones between closely related gull species  showed that interspecific divergence in plumage melanism and orbital ring color, clearly exceeded neutral genetic differentiation  <cit> . interestingly, abbott et al.  <cit>  showed that diversifying selection occurred in color-polymorphic damselfly  populations in a given year, while two generations later  population differentiation in morph frequencies fell behind neutral genetic differentiation. consequently, it is consistent with a temporal heterogeneity in selection in these populations, meaning that selection might vary over time, where both spatial and temporal heterogeneities likely play an important role in promoting and maintaining polymorphism. in addition, in the californian spider, theridion californicum, characterized by at least eleven color morphs, genetic analyses of several populations revealed that such polymorphism is maintained through balancing selection, i.e. acting to maintain polymorphism across populations  <cit> .

overall, these studies suggested that observed intraspecific color variations in both vertebrates and invertebrates are often the result of a local adaptation and are not due to a random genetic drift. therefore, observed color polymorphism in these studies is not neutral from an evolutionary point of view. in this respect, recent studies highlighted that the presence of intraspecific color polymorphism might increase the adaptive potential of a species hence its long-term survival and capacity to deal with environmental variations . as a consequence, the important color polymorphism found in the asp viper might be accountable for its unique capacity among reptiles to deal with a large number of habitat types, ranging from mediterranean coastal areas to alpine regions . indeed, color morphs and their intrapopulational frequencies are tightly linked to geographical regions and habitat types . a recent field study highlighted intrapopulational sex-specific differences in body condition between melanistic and blotched v. aspis  <cit> , melanistic females exhibiting higher body condition than blotched ones. these results were attributed to the importance of an efficient thermoregulation for females during gestation, and to higher rate of predation in melanistic males compared to blotched ones. since males are actively searching for females during the breeding season, and are forced to move away from their shelter, their chance of being predated is greater than for females  <cit> . these results illustrated the complex role that coloration plays in ectothermic vertebrates, and how it can be involved in the evolution of such organisms.

CONCLUSIONS
the presence of important color polymorphism within a species may provide more opportunities to adapt and cope with different environmental pressures  <cit> , leading in turn to a potentially larger distribution area and a higher resilience. even though the studied area presents a unique case in the asp viper, investigating the different environmental characteristics  leading to the local selection of this particular pattern can be of major interest to understand i) the selection pressure on the dorsal coloration in ectothermic vertebrates ii) the speed of the morphological adaptation and iii) the importance of such phenotypic diversity within species.
