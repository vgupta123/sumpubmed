BACKGROUND
immunoglobulins are glycoproteins produced by b-lymphocytes, and are a crucial component of the host’s adaptive immune system  <cit> . immunoglobulin g  is the predominant class of immunoglobulins involved in transfer of passive immunity to newborn calves via colostrum  <cit> . failure of transfer of passive immunity  occurs when calves fail to ingest or absorb sufficient igg  from colostrum  <cit> . ftpi is a major predisposing risk factor for early neonatal losses associated with gastroenteritis, pneumonia, and septicemia  <cit> . reduced long-term productivity, decreased milk yield, and increased culling rates during first lactation have also been associated with ftpi  <cit> . the monitoring of igg levels is important for assessment of farm colostrum management and to reduce productivity losses associated with calf-hood diseases  <cit> .

a number of methods have been used to measure the igg concentrations in bovine serum. the most widely accepted reference method used is the radial immunodiffusion  assay that provides direct measurement of igg concentrations in bovine serum  <cit> . however, rid has significant drawbacks, including the time it takes to obtain results , utilization of labile reagents, high cost  <cit> , and discrepancies among rid kits due to inaccuracies associated with the internal standards  <cit> . other methods, such as refractometry, zinc sulfite turbidity test, sodium sulfate turbidity test, serum γ-glutamyl transferase activity, whole blood glutaraldehyde coagulation test, and elisa have been used to identify calves with ftpi with varying degrees of accuracy  <cit> . despite these options, there is a need for an accurate, simple, rapid, and cost-effective method for quantification of igg concentrations in bovine serum and for diagnosis of ftpi in dairy calves, which may be readily translated to the farm, clinic or small laboratory setting.

infrared  spectroscopy is one of the most important tools in modern analytic chemistry that is used for quantitative and qualitative analyses of many sample types  <cit> . to obtain ir spectra from these samples various analyzing techniques have been used including transmission and attenuated total reflectance methods. for transmission techniques, the sample is directly placed into the path of the ir beam, and then the transmitted energy is measured and a spectrum is generated  <cit> . however, the atr technique differs in that it measures changes that occur to the totally internally reflected ir beam after the beam comes into contact with a sample  <cit> .

transmission ir spectroscopy, in combination with partial least squares  regression, has been used to measure total serum protein, glucose, albumin, triglyceride, cholesterol, and urea in human serum samples  <cit> . in veterinary applications, it is also widely used for nutrient analysis of milk  <cit> , and screening of dairy cows for metabolic diseases such as ketosis  <cit> . technical difficulties commonly encountered with transmission techniques can make routine collection of high-quality spectra in the field situation difficult  <cit> . these difficulties include practical issues associated with filling and cleaning short-pathlength cells , uncertainties in optical pathlength , and the time required for sample submission and preparation  <cit> . in contrast to transmission ir spectroscopy, attenuated total reflectance infrared  spectroscopy by its nature does not have issues associated with optical pathlength or sample thickness. the measurement is simple and fast, and requires little or no sample preparation  <cit> . for these reasons, atr has emerged as one of the most commonly used ir spectroscopic analyzing techniques, with applications addressing various clinical diagnostic problems in human and veterinary medicine . most recently, robust, small footprint atr equipment has been manufactured that is ideally suited for field use on the farm, veterinary clinic or small laboratory  <cit> .

the objectives of this study were to investigate the potential use of atr, in combination with multivariate data analysis, for the rapid quantification of igg concentrations in bovine serum, and for the diagnosis of ftpi in dairy calves. this study also investigated the effects of different spectral data pre-processing techniques on model performance and predictive accuracy.

methods
serum samples
serum samples  from holstein-friesian calves and adult dairy cows were used. calf samples  had previously been collected for companion studies  <cit> , and adult dairy cow samples  had been collected for the maritime quality milk laboratory . samples were stored at -80 °c at the university of prince edward island before use. all samples were tested at the same time, using a radial immunodiffusion  assay to quantify the serum igg level and atr spectroscopy to acquire the ir spectrum for each sample. the research protocol was reviewed and approved by the animal care committee at university of prince edward island .

rid assay for igg
a commercial rid assay  was used as the reference method for determining serum igg concentrations. serum samples were thawed at room temperature and then vortexed for 10 s. subsequently, igg was measured using the bovine rid assay with a working range of  <dig> to 2748 mg/dl. for the eight samples that were collected prior to colostrum ingestion, igg was quantified using the bovine ultra low level igg rid kit with a working range of 10–100 mg/dl. each rid assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions using 5 μl of undiluted serum in each well. the diameters of the precipitating zones were measured after 18–24 h by the same individual, using a handheld caliper. each sample and manufacturer’s standards were tested in replicates of five, with one replicate per rid plate, and the mean values were calculated. the assay standards were used to construct a calibration curve that was used to determine the igg concentrations of the study serum samples.

atr assay for igg
infrared spectra were acquired using a customized 3-bounce attenuated total reflectance mid-infrared spectrometer . thawed serum samples were diluted  with deionized sterile water and vortexed at a maximum of 2700 rpm for 10 s to homogenize the samples. following dilution, 5 μl aliquots were evenly spread onto the atr element of the optics module of the spectrometer and dried by a stream of air from a domestic hair dryer. the sample was completely dried within 3-4 min and formed a thin film on the optical element.

spectra were collected over the wavenumber range of 4000–650 cm− <dig> with a nominal resolution of 8 cm− <dig>  for each spectrum,  <dig> scans were co-added to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. before each measurement, the stage of the optics module of the spectrometer was cleaned with 100 % ethanol and allowed to dry, and a new background reading was collected. each serum sample was tested in replicates of five. a total of  <dig>  atr spectra were collected and saved in grams spectrum  format , and then converted into prn  formatted data. the prn format spectral data were imported into matlab®  and further data analysis was performed using scripts written by the authors.

spectral pre-processing
several pre-processing methods, including savitsky-golay smoothing , first-order and second-order derivative spectra  <cit> , and two different normalization methods  and vector normalization)  <cit>  were applied to examine effects, if any, on the calibration models. this was followed by spectrum region selection of the 3700–2600 cm− <dig> and 1800–1300 cm− <dig> wavenumber regions, which exhibited the strongest absorptions in the original spectra. with five replicate spectra per serum sample, spectrum outlier detection was performed using dixons q-test  <cit>  at each wavenumber. if absorbance values were outliers  for over 50 % of the spectral data points for a given spectrum, that complete spectrum was treated as an outlier and excluded from further analysis. the average of the replicate spectra for each sample  was used for subsequent analysis.

multivariate calibration model development
the  <dig> serum samples were sorted based on igg concentrations obtained from the rid assays. serum samples with igg concentrations outside of the manufacturer’s stated performance range for the rid assay were excluded from further analysis . the remaining samples  were linked to their corresponding pre-processed ir spectra, and then split into two sets . the prediction set  was identified by ordering all of the serum samples according to their corresponding igg levels and selecting the spectra of every third serum sample as a member of the prediction set. thus, the prediction set encompassed the full range of igg values for use in testing the predictive performance of the calibration models. the remaining calibration set  was randomly split into training  and validation  data sets for model development.

calibration models were developed using pls regression to relate spectroscopic features  to the reference serum rid igg concentrations. pls regression was applied first to the training set, with up to  <dig> pls factors retained, to develop  <dig> trial calibration models. each of these models was employed to calculate the igg concentration of each sample in the validation set, and an error estimate  was calculated. this procedure was repeated  <dig>  times . the root mean squared error for the monte carlo cross validation value   <cit>  was calculated for each of the  <dig> trial calibration models, and then the optimal number of pls factors was chosen as the one giving the lowest rmmccv. once the number of pls factors was determined, the training and validation sets were combined  to evaluate a pls calibration model with the determined number of pls factors.

evaluation of the calibration models
the predictive accuracy of each multivariate calibration model was assessed using the independent prediction data set . the level of agreement between igg concentrations measured by rid assay and predicted by atr assay was first assessed for both the calibration and prediction sets by a scatter plot, pearson correlation coefficient, and the concordance correlation coefficient. this was followed by a bland–altman plot  <cit> , which was used to examine the differences between rid and atr assays values for the prediction set, thereby assessing the interchangeability of the two assays.

the precision of both the atr and rid methods was investigated using the prediction set samples. the mean and standard deviations  were calculated for the five replicates of each serum sample, and from these a modified coefficient of variation ); n = 5) was determined  <cit> . for each sample, and for each analytical method, the cv* was then plotted against the mean igg concentration.

finally, the potential utility of the atr method was further assessed using the ratio of predictive deviation , and the range error ratio   <cit> . according to this framework, a rpd < <dig> is considered to be poorly predictive; values between  <dig>  and  <dig>  are adequate for qualitative evaluation or for screening purposes; values > <dig>   are regarded as acceptable for quantification; and values > <dig>  suggest that the model is suitable for very accurate quantitative analysis  <cit> .

clinical utility of atr assay
to evaluate the clinical utility of the atr assay for the diagnosis of ftpi  in dairy calves, the test characteristics were calculated using 2× <dig> tables in prediction and entire data sets. these calculations were performed with stata version  <dig>  statistical software . sensitivity  was defined as the proportion of samples with ftpi, as determined by rid, that were classified as positive by the atr assay. conversely, specificity  was defined as the proportion of samples without ftpi that were classified as negative by the atr assay. accuracy was defined as the proportion of samples that were correctly classified by the atr assay.

discussion
in this study, the atr assay was successfully developed as a tool for the rapid measurement of igg concentrations in bovine serum. the analytical method development required the use of a large calibration data set with a wide range of igg concentrations to develop a multivariate regression model that could be then applied to determine the igg concentrations of new serum samples  <cit> .

the performance of the analytical method depends on the spectral pre-processing approaches chosen  <cit> . to seek the optimal choice, different pre-processing strategies were evaluated and the most accurate was selected according to model performance metrics  and confirmed by its high predictive accuracy   <cit> . regardless of the normalization method applied to pls analysis, spectral smoothing was universally beneficial . in contrast to other related studies  <cit> , spectral derivation provided no improvement.

the atr assay showed higher pearson correlation and concordance coefficients than have been reported for previous transmission ir spectroscopy-based serum igg assays for bovine  <cit> , equine serum and plasma  <cit> , and alpaca serum  <cit> . agreement between the atr and rid assays was poorer at high igg concentrations than at low igg concentrations . this may be attributed to the large number of serum samples with igg concentrations below 1000 mg/dl . as a result, the calibration model development was weighted towards low igg concentrations, which are particularly more important for diagnosis of ftpi in farm animals  <cit> . similar findings have been observed for transmission ir spectroscopy-based serum igg assays for bovine serum  <cit>  and ir-based assays for other species  <cit> .

the precision of the atr analytical method was found to be lower than that of the reference rid assay, as previously observed also for a transmission ir spectroscopy-based assay  <cit> . the relatively large cv* for the atr assay typically occurs because the samples in the prediction set are not involved in the optimization of the calibration model . nevertheless, given the conservative nature of this estimate of precision, the cv* of the igg concentrations from the prediction samples lies within the acceptable range , according to the quality control standards of the us food and drug administration agency  <cit> .

in anticipation of its application in the field, the atr-based igg assay was evaluated for its capacity to diagnose a clinically relevant problem - the occurrence of ftpi - using an igg concentration cut-off value of 1000 mg/dl  <cit> . the atr-based assay showed excellent sensitivity  and specificity , with values markedly better than those reported for a previously described transmission ir spectroscopy-based assay  <cit> . in comparison with other methods reported to assess ftpi in neonates, these results are equivalent to or better than most published assays  <cit> . the  <dig> false negatives for the atr method corresponded to samples with rid-determined igg values between 727–886 mg/dl, relatively close to the 1000 mg/dl diagnostic cut-off. these values indicate only partial ftpi, and thus the possible misdiagnosis of these animals poses a substantially lower risk of morbidity and mortality than would be the case for samples with lower igg concentrations  <cit> . there were no false positives identified by atr spectroscopy. the very low false positive rate has previously been noted for transmission ir spectroscopy-based assays for camelids   <cit> , and bovine samples   <cit> .

at present, the rid assay is acknowledged to be the reference standard test for quantification of igg in bovine serum  <cit> . in practice, measurement of igg by rid method is time consuming , utilizes reagents, and is expensive. in contrast, the atr assay described in the current work is performed rapidly  and the sample can be used with dilution in deionized water, the only required sample preparation step. these attractions, combined with practical advantages associated with compact, portable atr spectrometers  <cit> , suggest the real possibility of using the technique in the field for assessing pre-calving assessment of dams, the management of colostrum, and ensuring adequate transfer of passive immunity to neonatal calves.

CONCLUSIONS
attenuated total reflectance infrared  spectroscopy in combination with multivariate data analysis is a feasible alternative for the rapid quantification of igg concentrations in bovine serum and has the potential to effectively assess ftpi in neonatal calves. testing of different pre-processing approaches revealed that spectral smoothing  significantly improved analytical performance and accuracy as compared to otherwise identical methods with no spectral smoothing
