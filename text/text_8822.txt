BACKGROUND
the classical bordetella subspecies, b. bronchiseptica, b. parapertussis, and b. pertussis, are very closely related , but have diverged via large scale dna loss , or recombination  <cit> . b. bronchiseptica isolates retain a larger genome, the ability to grow efficiently in environmental reservoirs, such as lake water, and also infect a wide-range of mammals, including immuno-deficient humans  <cit> . disease severities can range from asymptomatic carriage to lethal pneumonia  <cit> , but in general b. bronchiseptica infections are lifelong and benign  <cit> . b. parapertussis and b. pertussis, the causative agents of whooping cough in humans, appear to have independently evolved from a b. bronchiseptica-like progenitor by loss of many genomic regions accompanying their adaptation to a closed life cycle, spreading from human to human without an environmental reservoir  <cit> . many genes involved in environmental survival have been lost in the human adapted subspecies, and genes involved in infection are largely retained but differentially expressed  <cit> . importantly, there are no known examples of genes acquired horizontally that contribute to the differential infections caused by these organisms  <cit> . the differences in infection phenotypes of the classical bordetella subspecies have been related to their differential expression of a largely shared set of virulence factor genes, rather than acquisition of new genes  <cit> . intriguingly, our recent comparative analysis of genomes of diverse bordetellae strains revealed that the classical bordetellae pan-genome is open, but with little uptake of new genetic material  <cit> . although there are few in depth analyses on individual bordetellae loci to determine mechanisms or the selective pressures contributing to variation, previous analysis has shown some evidence for hgt in several loci shared by most strains, such as the pertussis toxin assembly locus  <cit> . in the previous analysis, one such additional locus predicted to be horizontally transferred was that encoding the o-antigen.

a component of the lipopolysaccharide , o-antigen is an important gram-negative factor that protects against innate immunity, blocks antibody binding, and provides protection against environmental stresses, such as antibiotics  <cit> . there is considerable antigenic variation among o-antigens within and between bacterial species, including differences in sugar composition, chain length, and linkages due to transfer of the entire cluster of o-antigen genes or portions of the locus  <cit> . for example, escherichia coli  have over  <dig> antigenically distinct o-antigens, which contribute to evasion of the immune response  <cit> . other bacterial species, such as burkholderia pseudomallei, have less variation with two o-antigen serotypes identified  <cit> . however, there is still little understanding of why some organisms exchange dna frequently resulting in increased variation, while others add dna rarely or never, and of the evolutionary pressures that affect the frequency of hgt in each specific bacterial species.

although the classical bordetella subspecies share many known antigens that can induce cross-reactive antibodies, their lps structures differ in ways that may be important to their overall cross-immunity. in b. bronchiseptica, the lps is comprised of lipid a, an inner core , an outer core trisaccharide  and o-antigen encoded by lpx, waa, wlb, and wbm loci, respectively  <cit> . the architecture of the lps amongst the species is similar in its acylated lipid a and branched-chain core oligosaccharide, although there are marked differences in acylation patterns of the lipid a between all three subspecies  <cit> . in addition, several strains of b. parapertussis do not produce the trisaccharide, likely due to a mutation in the wlb locus, while b. pertussis does not produce an o-antigen due to the lack of the wbm locus  <cit> . the o-antigen locus in most b. bronchiseptica and b. parapertussis strains contains  <dig> genes, while the recently characterized wbm locus of one b. bronchiseptica strain  contains only  <dig> genes, most of which are genetically divergent from the previously characterized loci  <cit> . the first  <dig> genes within the o-antigen locus are thought to be responsible for the biosynthesis of the pentasaccharide linker region connecting the o-polysaccharide to the inner core, synthesis of the polymer subunit, and the capping sugar  <cit> . specifically, genes within the middle of the o-antigen locus are predicted to be responsible for modifications of the terminal sugar residue  <cit> . two sets of modifications have been noted to correlate with o <dig> and o2-serotypes, suggesting that antibodies against the o-antigen are directed against these terminal modifications  <cit> . additionally, it has been shown that o1-specific immune serum does not recognize o2-specific o-antigen molecules and vice versa, suggesting that varying antigenicity could allow for evasion of existing immunity within hosts  <cit> .

this study builds on preliminary evidence of hgt within the o-antigen loci of several newly sequenced bordetella strains  <cit> . we observed distinct regions within the locus with lower gc content and greater sequence diversity , but low dn/ds ratios than the rest of the genomes. in addition, incongruent branching patterns were observed in a phylogenetic tree based on variable genes in the locus compared to a genome-wide snp tree, suggesting that hgt may have occurred within regions of this locus. furthermore, there appears to be extensive recombination in regions within the locus. since hgt appears to be rare amongst bordetellae, we hypothesized that repeated hgt within this locus could be the result of strong selective pressure for escape from immunity to the parental strainâ€™s o-antigen type. b. bronchiseptica strains induced antibodies that efficiently recognized and killed bacteria with the same o-antigen type in vitro, and in vivo protected against infection in mice. however, strains of one o-antigen type were largely unaffected by immunity generated against strains of other o-antigen types. overall, this work describes evidence of multiple hgt events within regions of the o-antigen locus via recombination, and suggests escape from host immunity as a pressure that could select for these hgt events in the classical bordetellae.

RESULTS
diversity within the wbm loci correlates with different o-antigen immunogenic types
bordetella o-antigen types were previously defined as o1- or o2- serotype based on cross-reactive antigenicity  <cit> , but recently it was shown that b. bronchiseptica strain mo <dig> produces a poorly immunogenic o-antigen designated o <dig>  <cit> . this o-antigen, unlike o <dig> and o <dig>  was not recognized by antibodies generated during infection, and did not cross-react with any bordetella o1- or o2- serotype specific antibodies  <cit> . to assess the diversity of o-antigen antigenicity among the classical bordetellae, we examined more strains by purifying their lps and probing with antibodies generated against lps containing either o1-, o2-, or o3-type o-antigens  . among the newly sequenced strains, b. bronchiseptica strain d <dig> was recognized by o1-specific serum, while other strains  were recognized by o2-induced serum. as indicated by emerald green stain of the lps, both b. pertussis strains tohama i and  <dig>  as well as b. parapertussisov strain bpp <dig>  do not produce detectable o-antigens .

previous analysis of the first three bordetella genomes revealed differences between b. bronchiseptica strain rb <dig> and b. parapertussishu strain  <dig> within a region of the o-antigen locus shown to be required for o-antigen expression, wbmz-wbmo <cit> . additionally, previous comparative genomic hybridization  analysis revealed variability across the locus in many lineages  <cit> . to define the changes that have arisen within the o-antigen locus since the recent divergence of these organisms, we compared the sequence of the entire wbm locus and flanking genes in  <dig> genomes and plotted the percent nucleotide identity of these genes in each strain, including the seven newly sequenced genomes, to that of b. parapertussishu strain  <dig> . genes flanking this locus appear to be as highly conserved as the rest of the genomes of these closely related strains. both b. pertussis isolates  lack the wbm locus and make no o-antigen, suggesting the locus was lost during their relatively recent divergence from the other classical bordetella subspecies. the remaining eight strains all have highly conserved genes at either end of the wbm locus as well as multiple other genes within the locus that are conserved and apparently intact, and likely functional. this is consistent with the >95% identity in the core genomes of even the most distantly related of these strains . however, only three strains, bbr <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  contain an intact set of orthologs of all the wbm genes of the reference b. parapertussis strain  <dig> and the lpss of all four strains with this set of genes are recognized by anti-o <dig> o-antigen type antibodies . interestingly, these four strains are distributed widely across a genome-wide snp-based phylogenetic tree   <cit> . the two o1-type strains, rb <dig> and d <dig>  are similar to the four o <dig> strains in their conservation of the  <dig> genes from wbma through wbmn, but contain a very different set of genes within what we have designated variable region a  that correlates with their antigenically distinct o <dig> type . a comparison of all ten strains using rb <dig> as the reference reveals that d <dig> is >95% homologous to rb <dig> across the entire locus except for a small region comprising wbme . the two remaining strains, bpp <dig> and mo <dig>  both differ from the other six strains in a region we have designated variable region b  . strain mo <dig>  the sole example of the poorly antigenic o <dig> type   <cit> , lacks vra genes and has a set of genes in vrb that appear intact, but are either novel or highly divergent orthologs with as little as 50% similarity to reference strain genes . this set of genes is apparently sufficient to make a poorly antigenic o-antigen   <cit> . strain bpp <dig>  which does not appear to make o-antigen, has a nearly complete vra, but a highly divergent vrb, with several genes of low similarity to reference genes, one unique gene and two apparent pseudogenes. the two variable regions  are flanked in all b. bronchiseptica and b. parapertussis strains by genes wbma, wbmb and wbmc, which are conserved and share between  <dig> and 100% sequence similarity . in addition, all of these strains except mo <dig> also share highly conserved genes wbmaa and wbmbb on the other flank. interestingly, some distantly related strains retain highly homologous genes to the reference , while other strains that are much more closely related differ substantially in discrete islands of genes. for example, b. parapertussis strains isolated from human  and sheep  differ in two distinct regions, wbmi-q and wbmd-f . also, some strains are closely related based on genome-wide snps  but have different sets of genes that correspond with their different serotypes , whereas some distantly related strains  share the same serotype specific genes . together, these data reveal that eight out of ten closely related strains retain genes of high sequence similarity within this locus, but that four of these strains differ substantially in one or both of two variable regions. overall, these differences appear to correlate with antigenically different o-antigen types, but do not correspond to the genome-wide snp-based phylogenetic tree relating these strains.

horizontal gene transfer of o-antigen loci in the classical bordetellae
one potential explanation for high snp density within a region is that spontaneous mutations accumulate due to positive  selection. to examine positive or negative selective pressures on the evolution of the o-antigen locus, we calculated the dn/ds ratio for each gene across the entire locus for all strains . for all genes within all strains, the wbm loci dn/ds ratios were below  <dig>  a signature of negative  selection, indicating that positive selection is not the driving evolutionary force . we also found no positively selected sites  in any of genes, except wbmf and wbmc . however, when we account for recombination using parris in hyphy package  <cit> , there is no evidence of positive selection in either wbmf or wbmc , suggesting the possibility of other mechanisms, such as hgt, as the source of the diversity of the o-antigen locus.

one signature of hgt is that the acquired region displays a difference in genome-wide characteristics, such as gc content. as previously noted in other bacterial species where o-antigen loci have been transferred gc content is consistently lower than the rest of the genome  <cit> . an analysis of the gc content of the entire bordetellae genomes identified the o-antigen locus as the most different from the genome average gc content of ~67% , with the gc content of many wbm genes differing by more than two standard deviations  from the genome average. similar results were observed using a  <dig>  base pair sliding window . strains of the same o-antigen type had patterns of low gc content that were similar to each other, but differed from those of other o-antigen types . intriguingly, the lowest gc content corresponded to the regions of highest diversity within vra and vrb , suggesting the evolutionary history that gave rise to this diversity was not consistently under the pressures that maintain very high gc content elsewhere in the genomes of the bordetellae. these data also suggest the possibility of hgt of the locus.

to further assess the likelihood of hgt within vra and vrb of the o-antigen locus, we constructed maximum-likelihood trees based on individual o-antigen genes and compared them with the genome-wide snp tree . trees based on conserved genes, such as wbma, were similar to the genome-wide snp tree and the previous multi-locus sequencing typing  tree  <cit> , with b. bronchiseptica complex i and iv strains clustering separately, for example. genes within vra, including wbmz, produced trees with different branch patterns that correlated with o-serotype, further supporting the conclusion that these genes are likely to have been laterally transferred . additionally, other genes, such as wbml and wbme, within the vrb produced trees with isolated branches containing either one or two strains , while other strains appeared to cluster together with a branching pattern similar to the genome-wide snp tree . these data are consistent with the conclusion that genes within the o-antigen locus were horizontally transferred.

horizontal gene transfer via recombination
since we did not observe any mobile elements associated with hgt, we used a multi-software analysis approach to predict recombination breakpoints within the locus. we used both substitutions-distribution methods, such as geneconv, siscan, maxchi, and chimaera, which test for significant substitutions clustering within sequences, and phylogenetic methods, including recombination detection program , bootscan, and genetic algorithms for recombination detection , which search for significant differences in tree topologies in order to predict recombination breakpoints  <cit> . both methods predicted several recombination breakpoints in the o-antigen locus . although there were some differences in the exact positions identified by each method, we observed similar trends overall. from the gard method, there were  <dig> major breakpoints, identifying  <dig> different segments  in the o-antigen locus . the wbmz-wbmo gene cluster  correlates with serotypes o <dig> and o <dig>  within vrb, two segments were predicted in this recombination analysis, vrb <dig>  and vrb <dig> . additionally, there were some minor breakpoints in bb <dig>  wbmq, wbmk, wbmj, wbmi/h, wbmd, and wbmc , most of which are in vra or vrb. from seven different methods in the rdp <dig> package, seven segments were predicted, detected by more than four methods in rdp, in the different strains. in b. bronchiseptica strain mo <dig>  recombination breakpoints were predicted in bb <dig>  and between wbme and wbmd. two segments were predicted in b. bronchiseptica strain d <dig>  including wbmz-wbmo and wbmf-wbmd, while one segment between wbms/t and wbmo was predicted in b. bronchiseptica strain rb <dig>  additionally, two fragments were predicted in b. parapertussisov strain bpp <dig>  including regions between wbmq and wbmh as well as between wbmf and wbmc. lastly, one segment between bb <dig> and wbmz was predicted in b. parapertussishu  <dig>  these segments appeared to be transferred from unknown sources, although most of the segments have high similarity to regions within other bordetellae strains . interestingly, our previous phylogenetic analysis was supported by this recombination analysis. for example, we observed different tree topology trends in conserved regions at the beginning and end of the locus as well as in vra and vrb . these topology trends correlate with the five observed consensus segments  in our recombination analysis . together, these data suggest that parts of the o-antigen locus may have been horizontally transferred via homologous recombination.

selective advantage of the divergent o-antigens in the bordetellae
since hgt appears to be rare amongst bordetella subspecies, evidence of multiple hgt events in the o-antigen locus could reflect an increased frequency of acquisition of the genes within this locus or selective pressure on these genes. to examine the potential selective advantage of acquiring a new o-antigen serotype, we incubated b. bronchiseptica strains rb <dig> ,  <dig>  or mo <dig>  with serum containing antibodies generated against each lps type. 10% o <dig> lps-specific serum killed >85% of o <dig> strain , but did not kill either o <dig>  or o <dig>  strains . this antibody-mediated killing was dose-dependent, as 1% and  <dig> % o1-specific serum did not kill strain rb <dig> . in a similar dose-dependent manner, o <dig> lps-specific serum killed the o <dig> strain but did not kill either o <dig> or o <dig> strains . surprisingly, o <dig> lps-specific serum antibodies did not kill any of these strains . thus, antibodies generated by non-cross reactive o-antigen types cannot recognize and kill other strains with different o-types, and the o <dig> serotype does not appear to induce an effective o-antigen antibody response.

in order to assess if an antigenically different o-antigen serotype could confer a selective advantage by allowing evasion of immunity to other o-antigen serotypes, mice were vaccinated with different o-type lpss and challenged with o1-, o2-, or o3-type bacteria. previous research indicated that o <dig> and o2-type o-antigens do not induce cross-protective antibodies that mediate efficient clearance of bacteria with the opposite o-antigen type  <cit> . similar to previous results, nasal cavity and tracheal colonization was not affected by any lps vaccination . however, o1-type lps vaccination reduced rb <dig>  colonization in the lungs by ~90%, but colonization by  <dig>  or mo <dig>  was unaffected . similarly, vaccination with o2-type lps reduced lung colonization by an o <dig> strain by 99%, but did not affect colonization by o <dig> or o <dig> strains. strikingly, o3-type lps vaccination did not reduce colonization by any b. bronchiseptica strain, consistent with this o-type being poorly immunogenic. overall, these results indicate different o-antigens induce little cross-protective immunity, suggesting that acquisition of a new o-antigen type via hgt could confer a selective advantage.

discussion
the classic examples of hgt involve the acquisition of clusters of new genes to a species, such as plasmids or pathogenicity islands, via mechanisms involving insertion sequences or other mobile elements  <cit> . while acquiring new genes by hgt is often associated with changes in bacterial pathogenesis, within the classical bordetellae subspecies these differing characteristics have not been attributable to the acquisition of any new genes conferring differential host specificity or increased pathogenesis  <cit> . intriguingly, our recent analysis of the genomes of eleven diverse strains of classical bordetella revealed substantial genome loss in some lineages, but no known acquisition of new genes that could be associated with differing phenotypes  <cit> . this analysis based on the aforementioned genomes also predicted that the pan-genome of the classical bordetellae was open with limited uptake of new genetic material. the multiple recombination breakpoints within the o-antigen locus appear to represent hgt events within the bordetella evolutionary history and subsequent exchange between bordetellae subspecies . these organisms therefore represent a model system to understand how pathogens evolve over time, as well as present the opportunity to examine pressures that drive selection for hgt events.

hgt between closely related bacterial species is more frequent, albeit harder to detect, than between distantly related bacteria  <cit> . this may be because closely related species are in greater contact in that they share overlapping ecological niches or because they have similar genomic characteristics, making transferred dna less likely to be rejected  <cit> . based on low gc content, high snp densities with low dn/ds ratios, and dissimilar phylogenetic trees across the locus, we identified subsets of genes within the o-antigen locus of b. bronchiseptica strains, including genes encoding o <dig> and o2-types, that appear to have been acquired via hgt. although we have not yet identified any associated mobile elements, such as a trna  <cit>  or insertion sequence elements  <cit> , we have predicted several recombination breakpoints within the locus. in salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, and klebsiella species, genes toward the center of the o-antigen cluster are less conserved compared to the genes at the ends, and this has been suggested to facilitate the exchange of interchangeable modules within the locus to form new o-antigens  <cit> . the absence of mobile elements near the breakpoints suggests multiple recombination-mediated hgt events involving o-antigen genes contribute to the different o-antigen types of the classical bordetellae subspecies. previous analysis of classical bordetellae genomes indicates that these bacterial subspecies, particularly b. pertussis, have evolved through genome loss, which is associated with adaptation to a closed lifestyle within its human host  <cit> . notably, b. bronchiseptica complex iv strain mo <dig>  isolated from a human, produces the poorly immunogenic o-antigen that shows evidence of recombination based hgt, as well as has lost several genes within the locus. therefore, it is also possible that variation within the o3-type locus may be indicative of gene acquisition or the genome undergoing reduction as b. bronchiseptica complex iv strains potentially adapt to a new environment.

the functional interdependence of the o-antigen synthesis/assembly pathways appears to limit recombination within the classical bordetellae locus. for example, the segment between wbma and wbmc, which was predicted to contribute to the linker region synthesis  <cit> , is confirmed to be conserved as a unit . since wbmf, wbmg, and wbmh together constitute the pathway for converting udp-mannac3naca to the udp-galnac3naca for the o ps backbone  <cit> , they also appear to be conserved as one segment. similarly, wbml, wbmm, and wbmn, which are within the same segment , are known to encode proteins that comprise atp-binding cassette  transporter systems to export the o-antigen  <cit> . the interdependence of genes in these pathways is a critical consideration, since strains recombining in these regions might have a fitness disadvantage and thus be outcompeted. this interdependence also means that an acquired set of genes must be complete and sufficient for a new phenotype, such as an altered o-antigen serotype, in order for there to be selective advantage to its acquisition. since hgt appears to be quite rare amongst these organisms, it is therefore of great interest that there are potentially at least five different hgt events within this locus in these ten strains. together, these data suggest that there is strong selection for the newly acquired genes within this locus, and therefore that each set of acquired genes is sufficient to confer a novel and important phenotype.

pan-genome analysis indicates that genes associated with diverse phenotypes, antibiotic resistance, and that confer selective advantages are often found within the accessory genome rather than the core genome  <cit> . o-antigen, which is included in the classical bordetellae accessory genome, may be variable within the subspecies due to its selective advantage of functional interdependence, immunity evasion, or host adaptation. in s. enterica and e. coli, multiple o-antigen serotypes have been identified  <cit>  and are hypothesized to contribute to evasion of cross-immunity  <cit> , thereby allowing the circulation of multiple closely related strains with different o-antigens within the same population. loss of the o-antigen locus by b. pertussis has been suggested to be a result of competition between it and a b. bronchiseptica-like ancestor, which may have circulated within the human population prior to the emergence of b. pertussis <cit> . additionally, previous research investigating cross-protective immunity between o <dig> and o2-type o-antigens has indicated that lack of protection may allow for the circulation of antigenically distinct b. bronchiseptica isolates within populations  <cit> . the loss of antigenicity in some b. bronchiseptica complex iv strains, which have been suggested to be more frequently associated with human infections than complex i strains  <cit> , may in part be due to immune-mediated competition with b. parapertussis in the human population. additionally, the discovery of the third poorly immunogenic o-antigen type further highlights the significance of the immune response as a likely selective pressure that could be driving hgt amongst classical bordetella. it is intriguing that the poorly immunogenic o-antigen appears to be specific to b. bronchiseptica complex iv isolates and is not prevalent throughout all b. bronchiseptica and b. parapertussis isolates. this may be indicative of additional functions of the o-antigen to evade host immunity, such as complement deposition  <cit> , or perhaps evasion of phage, as has been shown in vibrio cholerae <cit> . poorly immunogenic o-antigens may render b. bronchiseptica isolates more susceptible, whereas o1-and o2-types may be more robust at protecting these bacteria against other environmental factors.

CONCLUSIONS
our study suggests that hgt of portions of the o-antigen locus in bordetella subspecies, mediated by homologous recombination, is a mechanism to generate divergent o-antigens. the lack of cross-immunity between different o-antigen serotypes may provide an advantage to the acquisition of a new o-antigen type and could explain the high frequency of hgt within this locus, relative to elsewhere in the genomes of bordetella subspecies. the evidence that o-antigen differences may allow evasion of immunity also leads to the prediction that greater variation will be observed within this locus, relative to others, as more bordetella genomes are sequenced.
