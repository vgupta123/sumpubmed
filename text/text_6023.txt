BACKGROUND
in  <dig>  kisspeptin, the product of the kiss <dig> gene, was first discovered as an anti-metastatic peptide in human carcinoma  <cit> . the kiss <dig> gene encodes a kisspeptin-precursor secondarily processed to give size-variants of kisspeptins, including kisspeptin- <dig> , kisspeptin- <dig>  and kisspeptin- <dig> , in human  <cit> . all these kisspeptin size-variants encompass the c-terminal 10-amino acid sequence , which represents the minimal sequence for bioactivity. this kp sequence also presents the pecularity to be highly conserved among vertebrates, while the other part of the precursor sequence is highly variable. kisspeptins belong to the rf-amide peptide family which also includes the neuropeptide ff , the gonadotropin-inhibiting hormone , the prolactin-releasing peptide  and the 26rfa peptides  <cit> . in  <dig>  gpr <dig>  a gene encoding an orphan g-protein coupled receptor, was cloned in the rat  <cit> . it was not until  <dig> that gpr <dig> was identified as the cognate receptor of the kisspeptins  <cit> .

both kisspeptin  and its receptor  were demonstrated as crucial players of the reproductive function in mammals  <cit> . they act upstream in the gonadotropic axis by activating gonadotropin-releasing hormone  neurons and are considered as major puberty gatekeepers and reproduction regulators  <cit> . mutations or targeted deletions of kiss or kissr resulted in hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in human and rodents  <cit> . this pathology is characterised by the failure of the reproductive function due to low circulating levels of gonadotropin hormones , inducing low plasmatic levels of sex steroids including estradiol , testosterone and progesterone . in contrast, overexpression of kisspeptin can induce precocious puberty onset in human and rodents  <cit> .

since their discovery in mammals, the kisspeptin systems  have been identified in most vertebrate groups including cyclostomes, chondrichtyans, teleosts, amphibians and sauropsids  <cit> . phylogenetic and syntenic analyses  <cit>  revealed that three paralogous genes encode the current vertebrate kisspeptins, i.e. kiss <dig>  kiss <dig> and kiss <dig> genes, and up to four paralogous genes encode their receptors, i.e. kissr <dig>  kissr <dig>  kissr <dig> and kissr <dig> genes, according to the recent classifications by pasquier et al  <cit> . this kiss and kissr diversity likely arose from the two successive rounds of whole genome duplication   <cit>  that have occurred in early vertebrates  <cit> . following these events, the evolutionary history of kiss and kissr was marked by multiple gene loss events in the various vertebrate lineages  <cit> . notably, due to massive gene loss, there is no impact of the teleost specific third round of genome duplication  on the current number of kiss or kissr in teleosts  <cit> . strikingly among sauropsids, a complete loss of the kisspeptin system may have occurred in birds, as suggested by the lack of kiss and kissr homologs in the current bird genomic databases  <cit> .

nevertheless, some immunocytochemical and experimental studies suggest the existence of a kisspeptin system in birds. previous studies, using polyclonal antibodies against human kp, have reported the observation of kiss immunoreactivity in mallard duck hypothalamus  <cit>  and hen cultured granulosa cells  <cit> . even if these results have to be considered with caution since they could reflect immune cross-reaction with other rf-amide peptides, effects of human kp on reproductive function  <cit> , lipid metabolism  <cit>  and food intake  <cit>  have also been reported in birds. concerning the reproductive function, in adult mallard drake, central administration of human kp was able to increase the plasma concentration of lh  <cit> . in juvenile female quail, daily peripheral injections of human kp induced an anticipated onset of egg-laying, an accelerated growth of the reproductive organs and an increase in e <dig> secretion  <cit> . the same treatments also increased cgnrh-i, gnrh-receptor ii and lhβ mrna expressions, while they decreased gnih and fshβ expressions  <cit> . in vitro, human kp treatment increased progesterone secretion in cultured chicken ovarian granulosa cells from preovulatory follicles  <cit> . in contrast, in adult male chicken, peripheral injections of human kp led to decreased circulating testosterone level  <cit> . the effects of exogenous kp treatments on the bird gonadotropic axis could be obtained using other rf-amide peptides such as human 26rfa suggesting that they could be non-specific  <cit> . furthermore, it has recently been suggested that this inhibitory effect of exogenous kp on testosterone levels could be mediated by gnih receptor in bird, since kisspeptin was shown to bind to this receptor  <cit> .

as functional approaches suggest that exogenous kisspeptins could exert physiological effects on birds while no kiss or kissr has been evidenced in the different bird genomic databases so far, the question of the existence of a kisspeptin system in birds remains open. in order to address this question in an evolutionary context, we choose to investigate the kiss and kissr gene diversity in the genomic databases from representatives of different sauropsid groups, including ophidian, chelonian, crocodilian, and bird genomes. this integrated approach enabled us to improve the evolutionary history of both kiss and kissr families in the sauropsid lineage and to demonstrate, for the first time, the presence of a kiss2-like gene in the genome of three different bird species.

RESULTS
prediction of sauropsid kiss
to further assess the kiss diversity, we investigated the presence of these genes in the genomes from various sauropsid groups: the indian python as representative of ophidians; the painted turtle and the chinese  turtle as representatives of the chelonians; the american alligator, the saltwater crocodile and the indian garial as representatives of crocodilians; the chicken, the turkey, the mallard duck, the collared flycatcher, the zebra finch, the medium ground finch, the rock pigeon, the saker falcon, the peregrine falcon, the tibetan ground-tit, the budgerigar and the puerto-rican parrot as representative of birds.

considering that the kiss gene sequences are highly variable among species except for the sequence encoding the kp and its flanking proteolytic cleavage and alpha-amidation site, we focused our predictions on the open reading frame  containing these sequences. using various vertebrate sequences as query, we performed tblastn in the above-mentioned eighteen sauropsid genomes , resulting in the identification of orfs containing conserved sequences encoding kp.

two kiss genes in ophidians
two orfs containing the sequences encoding kp were found in the indian python genome. these two orfs are 369 bp and 390 bp long, respectively . once translated, each of them leads to a peptidic sequence encompassing a putative kp: ynlnsfglry  and fnfnsfglrf , respectively . the c-terminal ends of these two sequences are followed by a gkr motif . the sequences “x-g-basic-basic” or “x-g-basic-stop” are characteristic of the conserved proteolytic cleavage and alpha-amidation sites of neuropeptides  <cit> . in silico characterization of putative n-terminal proteolytic cleavage sites in the two translated orfs led to the prediction of putative mature peptides of  <dig> a.a. long ,  <dig> a.a. long  and  <dig> a.a. long  .

two kiss genes in chelonians
two orfs containing the sequences encoding kp were found in each turtle genome. these orfs are 528 bp and 465 bp long in both species . each of them encoded a putative kp followed by a typical c-terminal gkr motif: ynwnsfglry  and fnfnpfglrf  . in silico characterization of n-terminal proteolytic cleavage sites in the four orfs led to the prediction of putative mature peptides of  <dig> a.a. long  and  <dig> a.a. long  .

one kiss gene in crocodilians
one orf containing the sequence encoding kp was found in each of the three crocodilian genomes. those orfs are 567 bp, 402 bp and 348 bp long for alligator, crocodile and garial, respectively . all of them encoded a sequence encompassing a putative kp: ynwnsfglry  . the three peptidic sequences are followed by a typical gkr motif . in silico characterization of n-terminal proteolytic cleavage sites in the three orfs led to the prediction of putative mature peptides of  <dig> a.a. long ,  <dig> a.a. long  and  <dig> a.a. long  .

in addition to our findings, osugi et al. recently identified a kiss-like sequence in crocodile and alligator genomes, with striking amino-acid substitutions in positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> for the crocodile kp-like and positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> for the alligator kp-like . the authors suggest that the crocodilian kiss-like gene could be a pseudogene belonging to the kiss <dig> type that may be non-functional because of the presence of premature stop-codons upstream of the coding sequence of kp2-like  <cit> .

one kiss-like gene in birds
at first, the tblastn performed in bird genomic databases, using previously characterized kisspeptin sequences and newly described sauropsid mature kisspeptins as queries, resulted in no hit except for the mallard duck genome, pointing out a 99 bp long orf. we then amplified and cloned the genomic region encompassing the corresponding mallard duck orf . it encodes a peptidic sequence presenting the following  <dig> a.a.-sequence: fifnpfglgf . the c-terminal end of this sequence is followed by a typical gkr motif . the mallard duck kp-like sequence shares 40% identity with crocodilian, chelonian and ophidian kp <dig> while it shares 80% identity with the anole kp <dig>  the painted turtle kp <dig> and the chinese turtle kp <dig> . this is the first evidence of a kiss-like sequence in birds.

the observed mismatches, between mallard duck kp and the other sauropsids kp <dig>  concern the highly conserved amino acids at the second and ninth positions of the  <dig> a.a.-sequence . vertebrate kp usually present an asparagine  in second position whereas it is substituted by an isoleucine  in the mallard duck kp. similarly vertebrate kp also possess an arginine  in ninth position whereas it is substituted by a glycine  in the mallard duck kp, turning the kisspeptin typical c-terminal rf  motif into a gf one. these two positions may not be critical for kp bioactivity. indeed, alanine  substitution performed at one or the other of these two positions on human and rat kp induced no major change in bioactivity, although it decreased efficiency and binding property  <cit> . nevertheless, to our knowledge, no kp with both substitutions has been tested. thus, it could be of particular interest, for a future study, to test, in vitro and in vivo, the mallard duck kp.

the sequence encoding the mallard duck kp-like is encompassed in a small orf , and located  <dig> nucleotides downstream of a stop codon . in contrast to the other longer orfs identified in this study, no classical di-basic n-terminal end proteolytic cleavage site could be predicted in the translated mallard duck kiss-like orf. this did not allow the prediction of a putative mature peptide. in addition to the amino-acid substitutions in the kp-like sequence, these observations suggest that the mallard duck kiss-like gene is degenerated and could be a non-functional pseudogene, as suggested by osugi et al. for crocodilian kiss2-like pseudogene  <cit> .

nevertheless, the presence of two putative splice acceptor sites, between the 5′ stop codon and the sequence encoding the mallard duck kp-like , opens the possibility that the mallard duck kiss-like gene possesses a different exon/intron structure compared to the other vertebrate kiss genes. however no potential exon coding for a signal peptide has been predicted so far that could support this hypothesis. similarly, it is notable that the coelacanth kp <dig> is encoded by a 81 bp-long orf, that also suggests a different structure or a loss of function for this gene  <cit> .

as a second step, using the mallard duck kiss-like sequence as query, we performed tblastn in the other bird genomic databases. the results of this second tblastn series pointed out a 279 bp-long orf in the zebra finch genome  and a 117 bp-long orf in rock pigeon . each of them encodes a peptidic sequence encompassing the following  <dig> a.a.: fkvnllglgf and fnvnplgvgf, respectively . these sequences share 70% identity with each other, 60% identity with mallard duck kp, 50% and 60% identity, respectively, with the anole kp <dig>  and only 40% identity with the crocodilian and chelonian kp <dig> . both zebra finch and rock pigeon kp present a leucine  at their sixth positions, whereas other vertebrate kp, present a phenylalanine  at the same position. it can be noted that alligator kp2-like presents a f to r substitution at this position. the substitution of this f has been described as critical for the rat kp tridimensional structure and bio-activity  <cit> . the kp sequences are followed by a gkl motif in c-terminal for the zebra finch and a gkg motif for the rock pigeon . they represent unusual proteolytic cleavage and alpha amidation site motifs among kisspeptins, which commonly are of the g-basic-basic type  or g-basic-stop type. as in mallard duck, the sequences encoding the zebra finch and the rock pigeon kp-like are located  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides downstream a 5′ stop codon . in contrast to the other longer orfs identified in this study, but similarly to the mallard duck, no classical di-basic n-terminal end proteolytic cleavage site were present in the translated zebra finch and the rock pigeon kiss-like orfs, preventing the prediction of any putative mature peptide.

the presence of three putative splice acceptor sites, between the 5′ stop codon and the sequence encoding the rock pigeon kp-like , allows the possibility that the rock pigeon kiss-like gene possesses a different exon/intron structure, as proposed for mallard duck kiss-like gene. in contrast, no putative splice acceptor site has been predicted between the 5′ stop codon and the sequence encoding the zebra finch kp-like . in addition, no potential exon coding for a signal peptide could be predicted in this study, neither for rock pigeon kiss-like nor zebrafinch kiss-like. as suggested above for the mallard duck sequence, this could reflect either a different structure or a loss of function for these genes.

finally, using the zebra finch and rock pigeon kiss-like sequences as queries, we performed a novel tblastn search in the other genomic databases of birds, including chicken. this third tblastn series returned no hit, suggesting that the kiss-like genes of the other birds are even more degenerated than those found in the mallard duck, zebra finch and rock pigeon genomes.

classification of the sauropsid kiss
we recently demonstrated, by synteny analysis, that gnathostome kiss can be classified into three different groups, kiss <dig>  kiss <dig> and kiss <dig>  respectively  <cit>  which likely result from the 1r and 2r events in early vertebrates. the putative fourth kiss  has not been discovered in any current vertebrate species suggesting an early loss after the 2r  <cit> . in sauropsids, our previous study demonstrated that green anole possesses only a kiss <dig> gene  <cit>  and the recent study by osugi et al. demonstrated that chelonians possess a kiss <dig> gene and crocodilian a kiss2-like pseudogene  <cit> . in the present study, we performed phylogenetic and syntenic analyses in order to further identify and classify the newly predicted sauropsid kiss genes.

phylogenetical analysis of kiss genes
based on an alignment of  <dig> predicted long mature kisspeptin , and assuming sea lamprey kiss <dig> sequence as the out-group, a phylogenetic tree was generated . our in silico prediction of n-terminal proteolytic cleavage sites did not enable us to predict mature kisspeptin from the bird kiss-like , the crocodilian kiss2-like  <cit>  and the coelacanth kiss <dig> <cit> , which were excluded from this analysis. as shown in figure  <dig>  gnathostome mature kisspeptins cluster into three clades, kiss <dig>  kiss <dig> and kiss <dig>  which are supported by significant bootstrap values: 70%, 94% and 87%, respectively.

the kiss <dig> clade encompasses the chondrichtyan and actinopterygian kiss <dig> sequences including the spotted gar and teleost kiss <dig> sequences. the kiss <dig> clade also encompasses the sarcopterygian kiss <dig> sequences including the coelacanth, the amphibian and various mammalian kiss <dig> sequences and some predicted sauropsid kiss sequences among which the python kiss <dig>  the painted turtle kiss <dig>  the chinese turtle kiss <dig>  the alligator kiss <dig>  the crocodile kiss <dig> and the garial kiss <dig> sequences . these results provide the first evidence for the presence of orthologs to mammal kiss <dig> in sauropsids.

the kiss <dig> clade clusters the chondrichtyan kiss <dig> sequences, the actinopterygian kiss <dig> sequences, including the spotted gar kiss <dig> and various teleost kiss <dig> sequences. it also encompasses the sarcopterygian kiss <dig> sequences including the coelacanth kiss <dig>  the amphibian kiss <dig>  the platypus kiss <dig> and predicted sauropsid kiss sequences among which the python kiss <dig>  the painted turtle kiss <dig> and the chinese turtle kiss <dig> in addition to the already described grass lizard kiss <dig> and green anole kiss <dig> sequences .

the kiss <dig> clade clusters one amphibian sequence  with one chondrichtyan  . thus, this phylogenetic analysis strengthens the existence of three kisspeptin clades among gnathostomes. it also demonstrates that the predicted kiss, from the sauropsid genomes investigated so far, belong to the kiss <dig> or kiss <dig> clades.

syntenic analysis of kiss genes
in order to test the results obtained with the phylogenetic analysis, and to further understand the evolutionary history of kiss genes in the sauropsid lineage, we performed a syntenic analysis of the kiss neighbouring genes in representative sauropsid genomes. as we had already demonstrated the orthology relationships of the kiss genes for some sarcopterygian and actinopterygian species by synteny analyses  <cit> , we used the same species as references in the current study. thus, for the present analysis , we focused on one actinopterygian  and the following sarcopterygian representatives: basal sarcopterygian , amphibian , squamate , chelonian , crocodilian , bird  and mammals .

the human kiss <dig>  crocodile kiss <dig>  chinese turtle kiss <dig>  xenopus kiss1a, coelacanth kiss <dig> and spotted gar kiss <dig> are positioned in genomic regions containing common loci, including tead <dig>  nav <dig>  ppp1r12b, ppfia <dig>  mybph, kcnc <dig>  ren, golt1a, plekha <dig>  ppp1r15b, pik3c2b and syt <dig> . the painted turtle kiss <dig>  alligator kiss <dig> and garial kiss <dig> are also located in the vicinity of those genes . this supports the orthology relationship between all these kiss genes, all considered as kiss <dig> genes. syntenic analysis supports the absence of kiss <dig> gene in the chicken, mallard drake, zebra finch and green anole, although the above-mentioned neighbouring genes are present in their respective genomic databases .

the kiss-like genes of mallard duck and zebra finch, the chinese turtle, green anole, coelacanth and spotted gar kiss <dig> genes are positioned in genomic regions containing common loci including tead <dig>  strap, plekha <dig>  golt1b, c12orf <dig>  gys <dig>  ldhb, kcnj <dig>  abcc <dig>  cmas and syt <dig> . the painted turtle kiss <dig> and the kiss-like sequence of the rock pigeon are also located in the vicinity of these genes . the crocodile kiss2-like is located in an isolated scaffold, in the vicinity of the ldhb gene. this supports the orthology relationship between all these kiss, considered as kiss <dig> genes, or as kiss2-like genes in the case of crocodile, mallard drake, zebra finch and rock pigeon. the syntenic analysis suggests that chicken would not possess any kiss <dig> gene, although the above-mentioned neighbouring genes are present in their respective genomic databases .

as already demonstrated, the coelacanth kiss <dig> and the xenopus kiss1b genes are positioned in genomic regions containing common loci, including ntf <dig>  kcna <dig>  ppfia <dig>  tead <dig>  pih1d <dig>  aldh16a <dig>  kcnc <dig>  mybpc <dig> and syt <dig> . this supports the orthology relationship between these two kiss genes, both considered here as kiss <dig> genes. syntenic analysis supports the absence of kiss <dig> gene in human, crocodile, and green anole, although the above-mentioned neighbouring genes are present in their respective genomic databases . syntenic analysis also indicates that the considered region is largely missing from the bird and turtle genomic databases likely due to incomplete genome sequencing . indeed, among the fourteen considered genes in the kiss <dig> syntenic region, only kcnc <dig> gene is present in mallard drake genomic databases, only syt <dig> gene is present in zebra finch genomic databases and only kcna <dig>  pih1d <dig> and syt <dig> genes are present in chinese turtle genomic databases .

our previous syntenic analysis allowed us to consider a fourth genomic region in the osteichthyan genomes that could encompass a kiss <dig> gene  <cit> . this was based on the observation that the three conserved genomic regions, presenting kiss genes, also comprise paralogs from other gene families including tead1/2/3/ <dig>  nav1/2/ <dig>  ppfia1/2/3/ <dig>  kcnc1/2/3/ <dig>  golt1a/b, plekha4/5/6/ <dig>  ppp1r15a/b, pik3c2a/b/g, syt3/6/9/ <dig>  gys1/ <dig> and pth1/ <dig> . the members of these families are present among the three kiss syntenic regions and also delineate a fourth conserved region . however, kiss <dig> genes are completely missing from all osteichthyan genomes, including sauropsid genomes, investigated so far. this further supports the early loss of kiss <dig> gene after the 2r in vertebrates.

until the present study, the kiss gene diversity had been investigated in only a few sauropsid species and only kiss <dig> genes have been described  <cit> . kiss <dig> gene had been shown in squamate and chelonian representatives, and kiss2-like gene had been found in crocodilian representatives while no kiss gene could be found in birds  <cit> . our results, based on multiple sauropsid genomes, represent the first large-scale investigation and classification of kiss genes in sauropsids. we report here the existence of the kiss <dig> gene for the first time in the sauropsid lineage. we also provide the first demonstration of the existence of a kiss-like gene in three bird genomes . based on synteny analyses, bird kiss-like gene could be assigned to kiss <dig> type. this is in agreement with the higher sequence identity between bird kp-like and the other sauropsid kp <dig>  synteny analyses also highlighted the absence of kiss <dig> and kiss <dig> genes in birds, while the corresponding genomic environment is well conserved. in contrast, our syntenic analysis revealed an urgent need for genomic information in the putative region of bird kiss <dig> . in the human genome, this region is located in the chromosome 19q  . it has been well documented that most parts of the homologous region of hsa19q are not represented in the whole genome shotgun reads and bac libraries used to build the bird genome databases  <cit> . however, it has been demonstrated that this region does exist and is split into micro-chromosomes in the bird genomes  <cit> . these observations still leave open the possibility of the presence of a kiss <dig> gene in birds. to further investigate the kiss existence in birds, we looked for evidence of kiss mrna in the released bird transcriptomic databases.

investigation of the kiss existence in bird transcriptome databases
as kisspeptins are considered as neuropeptides, the kiss gene expressions were mainly investigated in the brain of vertebrates . in human, in addition to its cerebral expression, kiss <dig> transcript is found in placenta, intestine, testis, pancreas, spleen, kidney and liver  <cit> . in xenopus, kiss1a , kiss1b  and kiss <dig> genes are expressed in brain, testis, heart and liver  <cit> .

in order to investigate the potential existence of kiss transcripts in birds, we performed tblastn searches in twelve released transcriptomic databases, including brain transcriptomes from ten different bird species. we also investigated chicken transcriptomes including embryo, muscle, brain and liver, and zebra finch transcriptomes including blood and spleen. using as query the same sequences as already used for the search against the sauropsid genomic databases as well as the bird kiss2-like sequences, we performed tblastn in the twelve bird transcriptomic databases, but they resulted in no hit. in contrast, tblastn search using other rf-amide sequences as query, allowed us to retrieve transcripts of the corresponding peptides including gnih, npff, 26rfa and prrp . the absence of result concerning kisspeptin, in all released databases from a large number of species, supports the potential loss of functional kiss gene in birds. to further understand whether kiss genes have been lost in birds and to improve the kiss evolutionary scenario, we focused on the diversity of newly described kiss genes among the sauropsids.

evolutionary scenario of kiss genes in the sauropsid lineage
our analyses demonstrate that kiss <dig> and/or kiss <dig> genes are present in the sauropsid lineage. no trace of kiss <dig> was found in agreement with the hypothesis that this loss-event would have taken place at the early stage of vertebrate evolution  <cit> . among sarcopterygians, the kiss <dig> existence has been demonstrated in the coelacanth and the xenopus genomes,  <cit>  indicating that kiss <dig> gene has been inherited by the sarcopterygian ancestor and more recently by the tetrapod ancestor. no trace of kiss <dig> was found in the mammalian and sauropsid genomic databases, suggesting the loss of this gene in the amniote ancestor. however, the fact that the whole kiss <dig> genomic region is missing in the current bird genome databases, does not allow us to confirm the absence of kiss <dig> in birds by synteny analysis. considering the alternative hypothesis of the presence of kiss <dig> in birds, the phylogenetic position of birds among amniotes implies that kiss <dig> gene would have been conserved in birds and lost independently in mammals, squamates , chelonians  and crocodilians lineages. this hypothesis represents four evolutionary events, as compared to only one event if considering the loss of kiss <dig> gene in the amniote ancestor . this scenario is therefore the most parsimonious and is also supported by the absence of kiss <dig> mrna in the bird transcriptomic databases.

following the most parsimonious scenario , only kiss <dig> and kiss <dig> genes are present in the sauropsid lineage. both kiss <dig> and kiss <dig> are present in chelonians. kiss <dig> and kiss <dig> genes were also inherited by squamate ancestor since python still possesses both kiss <dig> and kiss <dig> genes, while kiss <dig> would have been lost in lizards. kiss <dig> and kiss <dig> genes may have been inherited by the crocodilian ancestor since garial, crocodile and alligator still possess a kiss <dig> gene and these two latter a kiss2-like gene. in contrast, kiss <dig> gene would have been lost in birds, while the presence of a kiss2-like gene in mallard duck, zebra finch and rock pigeon genomes suggests that kiss <dig> gene has been inherited by the bird ancestor .

the present investigation reveals the presence of a kiss-like gene  for the first time in several bird genomes and suggests that it would be the only kiss type remnant in this lineage. as discussed above, the characterized kiss2-like genes are probably not functional. furthermore, the sequence seems to be lacking in the other investigated bird genomes, likely reflecting a more advanced degenerating process.

these data suggest a loss of functional kiss system in birds. however, as mentioned in the introduction, previous studies have reported the observation of immunoreactive kiss cells in birds  <cit>  and the effects of human kisspeptin on food intake  <cit> , lipid metabolism  <cit>  and reproductive function  <cit>  in birds. some of the effects of exogenous kisspeptin could be considered as non-specific as they can be obtained using other rf-amide peptides such as human 26rfa peptides  <cit>  or the orexigenic neuropeptide y   <cit> . this suggests that exogenous kisspeptins are able to interact with, at least, one rf-amide receptor in birds. to date, no kissr gene or transcript has been identified in birds. that leads to the following question: do the birds still possess a kissr gene? in order to investigate this question, as we did for the kiss genes, we focused our attention on the diversity and the evolutionary scenario of the kissr genes in the sauropsid lineage.

prediction of sauropsid kissr genes
our previous studies demonstrated the existence of four kissr paralogs in vertebrates  <cit> . at that time, only green anole, chicken, turkey and zebra finch genomes had been investigated among sauropsids. only one kissr had been found in green anole and none in those birds. to further assess the kissr diversity in sauropsids, we performed tblastn in the eighteen sauropsid genomes mentioned in section prediction of sauropsid kissr genes using human kissr <dig>  anole kissr <dig>  xenopus gpr54-1b  and predicted coelacanth kissr <dig> peptidic sequences as query. the tblastn analyses resulted in the identification of multiple new kissr genes in six out of eighteen investigated sauropsid genomes.

two kissr genes in ophidians
two kissr genes were predicted from the indian python, each made of  <dig> exons and  <dig> introns . the putative transcripts encode two predicted proteins, i.e. python kissr <dig> and python kissr <dig> , of 368-aa and 398-aa, respectively .

two kissr genes in chelonians
two kissr genes were predicted from the painted turtle genome, each made of  <dig> exons and  <dig> introns . from the chinese turtle genome one kissr gene was predicted, also made of  <dig> exons and  <dig> introns, while only  <dig> exons and  <dig> introns could be predicted for the second kissr gene, as the exon- <dig> was missing probably due to assembling problems . transcripts encode predicted proteins, i.e. painted turtle kissr <dig> , painted turtle kissr <dig> , partial chinese turtle kissr <dig>  and chinese turtle kissr <dig>  .

one kissr gene in crocodilians
one kissr gene, made of  <dig> exons and  <dig> introns, was predicted in crocodile and garial genomes encoding crocodile kissr <dig>  and garial kissr <dig>  . only exon- <dig>  exon- <dig> and exon- <dig> of the alligator kissr gene could be predicted .

all predicted kissr proteins from ophidian, chelonian and crocodilian species present the typical seven transmembrane domains  of the gpcr family .

no kissr gene in birds
the tblastn analysis performed in bird genomic databases, using previously characterized kissr and newly described sauropsid kissr as queries, only returned genes corresponding to already characterized g-protein coupled receptors different from kissr with identity percentages below 40%. this percentage corresponds to the sequence identity shared with the galanin receptor, one of the kissr closest relatives  <cit> . thus, we did not find any kissr gene candidate in the bird genomic databases.

classification of sauropsid kissr
we have recently demonstrated that gnathostome kissr can be classified in four different groups, kissr <dig>  kissr <dig>  kissr <dig> and kissr <dig>  <cit> . we also previously showed that a sauropsid representative, the green anole, presents only the kissr4-type gene  <cit> . in the present study, we have included the newly predicted sauropsid kissr in the phylogenetic and syntenic analyses of the gnathostome kissr in order to further identify and classify them.

phylogenetic analysis of kissr genes
based on an alignment of  <dig> kissr peptidic sequences additional files  <dig> and 6: figure s <dig> and table s2), and assuming ambulacrarian  kissr as outgroup, a phylogenetic tree was generated that clusters the gnathostome kissr into four clades, which are supported by significant bootstrap values:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 79%, respectively . this is in agreement with our previous study  <cit> .

the kissr <dig> clade mainly encompasses sarcopterygian kissr <dig>  including mammalian kissr <dig>  xenopus gpr54-1a, coelacanth kissr <dig> and four predicted sauropsid sequences, i.e. the crocodile, garial, python and painted turtle kissr <dig>  the kissr <dig> clade also encompasses two actinopterygian kissr <dig>  i.e. the spotted gar and european eel kissr <dig> . these results represent the first evidence for the presence of orthologs to mammalian kissr <dig> in sauropsids.

the kissr <dig> clade mainly clusters actinopterygian kissr <dig>  i.e. spotted gar kissr <dig> and most of the previously described teleost kissr. this clade also clusters three sequences from sarcopterygian species, i.e. the xenopus gpr54- <dig>  the bullfrog  gpr <dig> and the coelacanth kissr <dig>  no sauropsid kissr is present in the kissr <dig> clade .

the kissr <dig> clade clusters two sarcopterygian kissr, i.e. the xenopus gpr54-1b and the coelacanth kissr <dig>  together with actinopterygian kissr, i.e. the spotted gar kissr <dig> and some teleost kissr including the zebrafish kiss1rb, the goldfish gpr54b, the medaka gpr54- <dig> and the european eel kissr <dig>  no sauropsid kissr is present in the kissr <dig> clade .

the kissr <dig> clade clusters one actinopterygian kissr, the spotted gar kissr <dig>  with sarcopterygian kissr including four sauropsid sequences, i.e. chinese turtle, painted turtle, anole and indian python kissr <dig> .

this phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that the sauropsid kissr cluster in the kissr <dig> and/or kissr <dig> clades, suggesting that only kissr <dig> and kissr <dig> are present in the sauropsid lineage.

syntenic analysis of kissr genes
in order to test the results obtained with the phylogenetic analysis, and to further understand the evolutionary history of kissr genes in sauropsid lineage, we performed a syntenic analysis of the kissr neighbouring genes in the same sauropsid genomes as the ones investigated for kiss . as the synteny analysis of the kissr genes has already been investigated and the orthology relationship already demonstrated for human, chicken, green anole, xenopus, coelacanth and spotted gar  <cit> , we used those species as references in the current study.

as for human, xenopus , coelacanth and spotted gar kissr <dig>  crocodile and chinese turtle kissr <dig> are positioned in genomic regions containing common loci, including palm, ptbp <dig>  lppr <dig>  med <dig>  arid3a, wdr <dig>  grin3b, c19orf <dig>  gadd45b and diras <dig> . the painted turtle, alligator and garial kissr <dig> are also located in the vicinity of those genes . this supports the orthology relationship of all these kissr genes, all considered as kissr <dig> genes. this syntenic analysis also supports the absence of chicken, mallard drake, zebra finch and green anole kiss <dig> gene, although the above-mentioned neighbouring genes are present in the respective genomic databases .

the xenopus , coelacanth and spotted gar kissr <dig> are positioned in genomic regions containing common loci, including ptprf, kdm4a, st3gal <dig> and dph <dig> . as already demonstrated  <cit> , this supports the orthology relationship of these kissr genes, considered as kissr <dig>  syntenic analysis also supports the hypothesis that the human, chicken, mallard duck, zebra finch, crocodile, chinese turtle and green anole genomes do not contain kissr <dig> gene, although the above-mentioned neighbouring genes are present in the respective genomic databases .

the xenopus  and spotted gar kissr <dig> are positioned in genomic regions containing common loci, including isca and zcchc <dig> . as already demonstrated  <cit>  this supports the orthology relationship of these two kissr genes, both considered as kissr <dig> genes. the coelacanth kissr <dig> is split into scaffolds jh <dig>  and jh <dig> , which are too small to contain any other gene . the syntenic analysis also supports the hypothesis that the human, chicken, mallard duck, zebra finch, crocodile, chinese turtle and green anole genomes do not contain any kissr <dig> gene, although the above-mentioned neighbouring genes are present in the respective genomic databases .

the green anole, coelacanth and spotted gar kissr <dig> are positioned in genomic regions containing common loci, including camsap <dig>  xab <dig>  stxbp <dig>  retn, rab3d, palm <dig>  notch <dig>  ephx <dig>  wiz and lpar <dig> , as already shown  <cit> . the chinese turtle kissr <dig> is located in an isolated scaffold, in the vicinity of the stxbp <dig> gene. this supports the orthology relationship of these kissr genes, all considered as kissr <dig>  this syntenic analysis also supports the absence of human, crocodile, and xenopus kissr <dig> gene, although the above-mentioned neighbouring genes are present in the respective genomic databases . syntenic analysis reveals that almost the whole considered region is absent from the bird genomic databases, likely due to incomplete genome sequencing. indeed, among the eleven considered genes in the kissr <dig> syntenic region, only wiz and lpar <dig> genes are present in the chicken and mallard duck genomic databases .

the results of this syntenic analysis are in agreement with our conclusions based on our phylogenetic analysis, that the sauropsid lineage possesses kissr <dig> and kissr <dig> genes. these results based on the study of multiple sauropsid genomes, represent the first large-scale investigation and classification of kissr genes in sauropsids. we were not able to find any evidence demonstrating the existence of kissr gene in the bird genomic databases. however, similarly to what was observed in the syntenic region of kiss <dig> gene , our syntenic analysis also emphasizes a drastic lack of genomic information in the bird putative kissr <dig> region. in human, this region is also located in the hsa19q. all these analyses lead to the hypothesis that, if birds still possessed a kissr gene, it could only be a kissr4-type gene. to further investigate the kissr existence in birds, we looked for evidence of kissr mrna in the released bird transcriptomic databases.

investigation of the kissr existence in the released bird transcriptomes
in tetrapods, the kissr genes are expressed in a wide range of tissues depending on the species. kiss1r  transcript is found in placenta, brain, spinal cord, pituitary and pancreas of human  <cit> , and in rat brain, liver and intestine  <cit> . in xenopus, the three kissr genes are all expressed in the brain. in addition, gpr54-1a transcript  is found in pituitary, testis and intestine, gpr54-1b  in testis and intestine, and gpr54- <dig>  in pituitary and heart  <cit> .

to further investigate the existence of kissr in birds, we looked for evidence of kissr mrna in the released bird transcriptomic databases. we performed tblastn searches in the same twelve bird transcriptomic databases we used to investigate the potential existence of kiss mrna). using the predicted sauropsid kissr peptidic sequences as query, the tblastn returned only hits corresponding to other g-protein coupled receptors different from kissr, as already observed when performing a blast search on the genomes . thus, we did not find any kissr transcript candidate in the bird transcriptomic databases. although a transcriptomic database cannot totally reflect the gene diversity of a species, the absence of result, in all current databases, is in favour of the loss of kissr <dig> in birds.

evolutionary scenario of kissr gene in the sauropsid lineage
our study revealed the presence of two kissr types in sauropsids, kissr <dig> and kissr <dig>  while the other two types, kissr <dig> and kissr <dig>  are lacking. among sarcopterygians, the presence of kissr <dig> and kissr <dig> could be demonstrated in coelacanth and xenopus genomes,  <cit>  indicating that both genes have been inherited by the sarcopterygian ancestor and more recently by the tetrapod ancestor. as these two genes are lacking in both sauropsid and mammalian lineages, they may have been lost in the amniote ancestor . in contrast, kissr <dig> and/or kissr <dig> genes are still present in the sauropsid and mammalian lineages , indicating that these two genes were inherited by their common ancestor. among sauropsids, kissr <dig> and kissr <dig> genes were inherited by the squamate ancestor, since python still possesses both kissr <dig> and kissr <dig> genes, while kissr <dig> gene would have been lost in lizards . both kissr <dig> and kissr <dig> genes were also inherited in the chelonian lineage, as observed in the turtles. the kissr <dig> gene would have been lost in the crocodilian lineage since crocodile, alligator and garial only possess kissr <dig> . the kissr <dig> gene would have been lost in the avian lineage, as shown by synteny analyses . concerning kissr <dig>  the fact that the whole putative kissr <dig> genomic region is missing in the current bird genome databases  does not allow us to assess the absence of this gene in birds by synteny analysis. thus, even if the absence of kissr <dig> in the various genomic and transcriptomic databases is in favour of the loss of this gene, its existence in birds cannot yet be fully excluded .

possible physiological significances of kiss loss in birds
our results provide the first evidence of the presence of a kiss2-like gene in the genomes of three bird species  and suggest its degeneration and loss of function in the avian lineage. considering the key-role of kiss in the control of reproduction in mammals, and the increasing evidences for the conservation of this role in other vertebrate groups such as amphibians and teleosts , the loss if this regulatory system in birds is specially challenging. recently in mammals, two other neuropeptides, neurokinin b , and dynorphin , were shown to be co-localized with kisspeptin in a hypothalamic neuron population, named kndy cells  . these kndy cells play a major role in steroid feedback and generation of episodic gnrh secretion, as well as in mediating the effects of nutritional status and stress on the reproductive axis. genes encoding nkb precursor and its receptor   <cit> , as well as dyn  and its receptor , have been identified in most vertebrates, including birds. functional studies in birds would allow to decipher whether those two neuropeptides control gnrh neurons even in the absence of kisspeptin.

the loss of kiss function in birds may also reflect the plasticity in the neuromediators and their receptors involved in the control of gnrh neurons and reproductive function throughout vertebrate evolution. for instance, concerning other rf amide neuropeptides, the major inhibitory role of gnih in reproduction first discovered in birds, is likely less effective in other vertebrate groups . as another example, large variations in the inhibitory role of dopaminergic neurons in the neuroendocrine control of reproduction have also been observed among vertebrates .

CONCLUSIONS
this study represents the first large-scale investigation of the kisspeptin system in multiple sauropsid genomes, including ophidians, chelonians, crocodilians, and avians. phylogenetic and syntenic analyses enabled us to classify various predicted sauropsid kiss and kissr and to re-construct the evolutionary scenarios of both gene families across the sauropsid radiation. we provide the first evidence for the presence of two kiss genes  and of two kissr genes  in the sauropsid lineage. these four genes, also present in the mammalian lineage, would have been inherited from their common amniote ancestor. among sauropsids, we paid special attention to birds and we demonstrated the existence of a kiss2-like gene in three bird genomes. the divergence of these avian kiss2-like sequences from those of other vertebrates, as well as our inability to find them in the genome of some other birds, reveals kiss <dig> gene degeneration and loss in the avian lineage. these findings represent the first molecular evidence for the existence and fate of a kiss gene in birds.
