BACKGROUND
the major histocompatibility complex  is critical to the immune response of jawed vertebrates. it contains genes essential to both the adaptive and innate immune systems. genes within the mhc have been traditionally divided into three different subregions. class i and ii regions contain genes of related structure and function, and encode molecules that are responsible for antigen presentation to t cells. the class iii region genes are more heterogeneous and their definition as class iii is based on their location between classes i and ii in eutherian  mammals rather than functional commonality  <cit> .

the human class iii region, spanning approximately  <dig> kb, contains  <dig> genes and is the most gene-dense region of the human genome  <cit> . class iii gene content has been shown to be well conserved, with an amphibian   <cit>  and a marsupial   <cit> , sharing most of the genes making up the human class iii region. in stark contrast, the class iii region in the chicken and quail is represented by only a single gene, coding for a complement component gene  <cit> . teleost class iii organisation is different again, with the mhc split over several different chromosomes. a survey of the fugu rubripes genome for human class iii orthologues uncovered class iii genes on  <dig> different scaffolds  <cit> . a similar survey in zebrafish found that, although there is a cluster of class iii genes on chromosome  <dig>  class iii loci are spread across all chromosomes  <cit> .

seven genes within the human class iii region, from mic to ski2w and including the tumour necrosis factor family, are thought to be involved in the inflammatory response. these genes have been referred to as the class iv region or the inflammatory region  <cit> . linkage analyses have revealed associations of the inflammatory region with many diseases, although in most cases the causal genes have remained unidentified. for instance, a region between nfkbil and mica may control susceptibility to hepatitis c virus-associated dilated cardiomyopathy, but the precise gene or sequence involved in this disease susceptibility remains unknown  <cit> .

if gene content and arrangement within the inflammatory region is important for function, we would expect that the same genes would be clustered in other species as well. the class iii region is indeed highly conserved, but a comparison of the mouse and human inflammatory regions reveals that not all genes are represented in both species. the mouse inflammatory region has no functional copy of ncr <dig>  and lacks both mic and mccd <dig>  pairwise alignment of the human and mouse class iii regions identified conserved non-coding elements which may act as regulatory elements, and even detected the presence of previously unrecognised genes  <cit> .

it has been shown that the power of comparative sequence analysis can be greatly increased by the inclusion of one or more non-eutherian mammals  <cit> . marsupials diverged from eutherian  mammals about  <dig> million years ago   <cit>  and neatly fill the phylogenetic gap between the bird-mammal divergence  and the eutherian radiation . their genomic sequences are more easily aligned to human than are those of birds or fish but, in general, have also diverged enough for important conserved elements to be easily detected. sequences that are highly conserved between eutherians and marsupials are likely to be functionally important, as non-functional sequences would have diverged over such a long period of evolutionary time  <cit> .

recent characterisation of the mhc of the grey short-tailed opossum  demonstrated that the eutherian mhc organisation is derived, whereas marsupials retain an organisation resembling the ancestral vertebrate arrangement in which the class iii region adjoins a combined class i and ii region  <cit> . although the gene content and order in the opossum class iii region is well conserved compared to eutherians, there are some differences, such as the absence of two genes  from the inflammatory region. the australian model marsupial, the tammar wallaby , last shared a common ancestor with the opossum about  <dig> million years ago  <cit> , providing a comparison similar to that of human/mouse. given the differences between the human and mouse mhcs, comparison of gene content and arrangement in a second marsupial species will permit identification of lineage-specific changes, and identify potentially important conserved non-coding sequences.

to date, comparative studies of the class iii region have focused on the conservation of gene content and arrangement. the only large scale sequence-based comparison of the region is between human and mouse  <cit> . the availability of class iii sequences from other eutherian and marsupial species permits a multiple species analysis to be performed, adding power to the comparative analysis. moreover, recent advances in the identification of conserved elements incorporate the phylogenetic relationship between species  <cit>  thereby reducing bias resulting from the use of closely related species.

here we report the characterisation of a bac harbouring wallaby inflammatory region genes, and extend the comparative analyses of this region over a wider phylogenetic distance. our wallaby data has allowed us to chart the evolution of the inflammatory region gene content and organisation, to perform in-depth analysis of conserved mammalian non-coding and coding sequences and to identify marsupial-specific conserved sequence elements. identification of such elements will assist in correlating disease-associated polymorphisms with sequences of functional importance  <cit> , assist in the identification of conserved transcription factor binding sites and ultimately result in a better understanding of gene function within the inflammatory region.

RESULTS
comparative analysis of gene content and arrangement of the inflammatory region
we sequenced a  <dig> kb bac containing a portion of the tammar wallaby mhc class iii region . the orthologues of  <dig> human class iii genes were identified using a combination of tblastn and genomescan . predicted genes were hand-curated using orthologous sequences as guides. the sequence identity of the predicted proteins are shown in table  <dig>  we do not have a complete sequence for mic, as the 3' end of the gene is beyond the boundaries of the bac.

orthologues of the  <dig> wallaby genes were examined in other species. gene content, structure, order and transcriptional orientation within this region are well conserved between the two marsupials  with one noticeable exception: the absence of ncr <dig> in the opossum. a search of the opossum genome assembly  failed to detect a copy of ncr <dig> elsewhere in the genome. the presence of the opossum orthologue of aif <dig> is yet to be confirmed. only the first and part of the last exon of aif <dig> were detected in the opossum genome assembly , but since these exons flank an unsequenced gap in the assembly, we assume that aif <dig> is present.

we next determined the organisation of genes across the interval sequenced in the wallaby . for the mammalian species, the genes form part of the mhc cluster and their order is conserved. twelve of the predicted wallaby genes have the same number of exons as their human counterparts. wallaby nfkbil <dig> is predicted to have one fewer exon than the human orthologue.

a comparison of marsupial and eutherian inflammatory regions reveals that one gene, lst <dig>  is missing from this region in the marsupials. lst <dig> sequence similarity between eutherian species is low , so the marsupial orthologue may have diverged to such an extent that it is difficult to detect. however, a hmmer  <cit>  search using the lst <dig> profile from pfam  <cit>  reveals no significant hits and genscan predicts no additional genes in this bac. at this stage, we cannot exclude the existence of lst <dig> in another region of the genome, though we think this is unlikely, as no lst <dig> orthologue was detected within the mhc or elsewhere in the opossum genome.

chicken orthologues of the mhc class iii region genes were not identified. orthologues of several genes were found in frog  and were located on the same genomic scaffold, but no orthologues of five genes  were detected anywhere in the frog genome. in the teleosts, orthologues for eight genes  were distributed over several chromosomes in zebrafish  or scaffolds in pufferfish . aif <dig> was identified in pufferfish but not zebrafish. genes were not grouped together in the same combinations in fish, but many were found with other genes from the eutherian class iii region. tnf, lta or tnf-n, apom and bat <dig> were found on the same chromosomal segment in all species studied  and in a similar transcriptional orientation.

repeat analysis
analysis of the distribution of repeats in the wallaby bac compared with the orthologous region in opossum and eutherians is shown in table  <dig>  wallaby and opossum have similar percentages of lines , sines  and dna elements, but the opossum has a much higher percentage of ltrs . most of these ltrs are endogenous retroviral elements, located mainly between mic and mccd <dig> and ltb and bat <dig>  this analysis also revealed a much lower percentage of sines in marsupials compared to eutherians whereas marsupials have a much higher percentage of lines than eutherians.

sequence conservation
we analysed the sequence conservation in wallaby- and human-referenced alignments of the mhc class iii inflammatory regions from eight mammalian species  using a phylogenetic hidden markov model . there were  <dig> conserved elements predicted in the wallaby inflammatory region, covering  <dig> % of the sequence . element lengths ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> bases, with a median length of  <dig> bases . predictions from both referenced alignments are compared in table  <dig>  the locations of conserved elements may be viewed using gbrowse  <cit> .

to investigate the distribution of conserved elements across various sequence types, we defined seven annotation classes: exonic, intronic, untranslated regions , repeats, and intergenic, which we further broke down into less than  <dig> kb upstream of an annotated gene, less than  <dig> kb downstream of an annotated gene, and more than  <dig> kb from an annotated gene. with the exception of tnf and lta, for which the wallaby sequences are known, genes were predicted in wallaby using genomescan and checked by comparison with other species. since genomescan does not predict utrs, sequence for the utr class was defined to extend from the predicted promoter to the translation start site, and from the translation stop to the poly-a tail. this approximation is likely to over-estimate the amount of sequence in this class and include intronic sequence that may not be conserved. for the wallaby-referenced alignment, the proportion of bases that are conserved in each sequence class and the distribution of conserved bases across classes are shown in figure  <dig>  we found that about 10% of non-coding sequence was conserved, and that about 29% of the predicted conserved sequence was non-coding.

highly conserved and lineage-specific elements
in order to identify highly conserved elements and lineage-specific conservation, we calculated the percent identity between the reference sequence and each of the aligned species within each of the conserved elements described above . elements with at least 90% identity between the reference and each aligned species were labelled highly conserved elements . three types of lineage-specific element were also defined: marsupial-specific elements , eutherian-specific elements  and elements that are present in eutherians and wallaby, but lost or highly diverged in opossum, which we termed undetected in opossum . table  <dig> provides the definitions of these elements. a summary of the properties of the hces and various lineage-specific elements is given in table  <dig>  elements obtained from the wallaby-referenced alignment may be viewed using gbrowse  <cit> .

eight hces were identified: two overlap the poly-a tails of nfkbil <dig> and apom, one is located in the 3'-utr of lta, one is found in the exon of c6orf <dig>  another in the 5'-utr of that gene, and there is one overlapping the first exon of bat <dig>  aif <dig> has an hce just upstream of its 5'-utr. in the human genome, it overlaps a number of human and non-human ests e.g. human , , mouse  and pig , and may represent additional 5'-utr sequence. bat <dig> contains an hce in intron  <dig>  it overlaps the start of the c/d box small nucleolar rna mu <dig>  which has previously been identified in the fifth intron of human, mouse and pig bat <dig>  <cit> .

seventeen mses were identified from the wallaby-referenced alignment. these elements are highly conserved between wallaby and opossum, but the eutherian sequences contain many alignment gaps. about  <dig> % of bases that are conserved are mses. mses tend to be long , because phastcons requires a longer stretch of conserved sequence when conservation is limited to just a few closely related species in the multiple alignment. thus, shorter mses may have been missed. the mses are distributed across the entire inflammatory region. only three mses overlap repeats identified using repeatmasker ; mse_ <dig> overlaps with a sine/mir3; mse_ <dig> overlaps with a line ). two genes  have exons containing mses. the  <dig> kb repeat-rich region between mic and mccd <dig>  which appears to be expanded in marsupials, contains two mses, although they do not coincide with identified repeats. the remaining mses are in introns  or in intergenic regions.

there were seven elements conserved in the wallaby and eutherians, but apparently not in the opossum. we termed these elements unidentified in opossum . six uios overlap exons of aif <dig> , which are present in wallaby and well conserved in eutherians . this led us to examine the opossum sequence in this region more closely and revealed that there is a large sequencing gap in the genome assembly here. the other uio is located in the second intron of nfkbil <dig>  it is a  <dig> bp segment of a sine/mir element that is well conserved between the eutherians and wallaby, but was not found in the opossum.

discussion
the comparison of genomes from an array of mammals, or even vertebrates, is key to identifying functionally important non-coding regions and gaining a better understanding of genome biology and evolution. comparison of the wallaby bac containing orthologues of the human class iii inflammatory region with the orthologous region in other vertebrates provides new insights into the evolution and regulatory organisation of the mammalian mhc inflammatory region.

gene conservation of region in mammals
by comparing the gene content and arrangement in the wallaby inflammatory region to the opossum and eutherians, we can reveal the evolutionary history of the region. the timing of events such as the loss or movement of genes from the inflammatory region can be ascertained. a comparison between the wallaby and opossum reveals that one gene  is present in the wallaby but absent in the opossum. comparative analysis of the marsupial and eutherian inflammatory regions reveals that lst <dig> became part of the region after the divergence of marsupials and eutherians. it is also apparent that the mouse is more divergent in gene content than the other eutherian species, lacking both mccd <dig> and mic in addition to having only a non-functional copy of ncr <dig> 

comparing the wallaby bac sequence with the orthologous region in other mammals revealed a high level of similarity between the gene content and organisation of marsupials and eutherians. variation in the level of conservation between the wallaby genes and other mammalian orthologues is apparent at the protein and nucleotide levels . the most highly conserved are those loci with putative housekeeping functions. for instance, wallaby bat <dig>  a member of the dead box protein family of atp-dependent rna helicases, is 99% identical to human bat <dig> at the amino acid level. the least conserved genes have products with specialised immune function, such as ncr <dig>  this level of sequence divergence is characteristic of genes of immunological importance because they evolve rapidly to counter rapidly evolving pathogens.

the presence of ncr <dig> in wallaby but its absence in opossum is not unexpected, since ncr gene content and function differs also between human and mouse  <cit> . ncr <dig> is a member of the gene family specifying natural cytotoxicity receptors, which are responsible for natural killer  cell activation  <cit> . in humans there are three expressed ncr genes but in mouse ncr <dig> is the only active gene, ncr <dig> having been lost  <cit>  and ncr <dig> a pseudogene  <cit> . the three human ncrs appear to have adopted specialised functions. ncr <dig> functions as the predominant activating nk receptor, whereas ncr <dig> and ncr <dig> have much more restricted expression profiles  <cit> . this suggests duplication of an original ncr gene with the specialization of duplicate genes in humans, and their loss independently in mice and opossums. the present study implies that these duplications took place much earlier than had been supposed, before the divergence of marsupials and eutherians.

one of the most obvious differences between marsupials and eutherians is the apparent absence of an lst <dig> orthologue in both marsupial species studied. sequence similarity between eutherian species is low for this gene so marsupial lst <dig> may have diverged to such an extent that it is difficult to detect. nonetheless, even our more rigorous search for this gene in the opossum using hmmer failed to detect an lst <dig> orthologue in the opossum genome. the function of lst <dig> is still being elucidated but it has been shown to have an immunomodulatory function with a very strong inhibitory effect on lymphocyte proliferation  <cit>  and its expression is up-regulated in response to bacterial infection and inflammatory mediators  <cit> . splice variants result in either membrane-bound or soluble lst <dig> isoforms that presumably carry out different functions.

mixed lymphocyte reactions  test the recognition and proliferation of t lymphocytes in culture. marsupials have a weak or even non-existent mixed lymphocyte response yet mount a normal graft rejection response  <cit> . initially, it was thought that this weak mlr was the result of a low level of mhc class ii variability  <cit> , an amino acid substitution in the mhc molecule  <cit>  or even a difference in the ontogeny of marsupial and eutherian t cells  <cit> . the absence of immunomodulation by lst <dig> may also be a contributing a factor.

our analysis of mccd <dig>  shows that this gene is much older than had been previously thought. this gene is present in the human mhc class iii region  <cit> , but is evidently lacking from this region in mouse; nor is there an orthologue elsewhere in the mouse genome. a previous study failed to detect mccd <dig> orthologues in genbank genome and est databases for any other species other than pig and it was suggested that mccd <dig> emerged  <dig> –  <dig> million years ago, prior to the divergence of pigs but after the divergence of rodents  <cit> . however, our demonstration of a mccd <dig> orthologue in the wallaby region reveals that this gene has been present in the mammalian lineage for over  <dig> million years, since marsupials and eutherians last shared a common ancestor, so was probably lost in the rodent lineage.

part of a wallaby mic orthologue was identified within the bac, lacking only the terminal exon and polyadenylation signal. this wallaby mic orthologue shows sequence identity to the human mic gene and the murine mill genes. phylogenetic analysis indicates the sequence is basal to both mic and mill . the presence of the mic orthologue in marsupials suggests that the mill gene family in the mouse was derived from a mic gene ancestor that has diverged, possibly as a result of having moved out of the mhc  <cit> .

thus, the highly conserved mammalian inflammatory region has been relatively stable over the last  <dig> million years, with the apparent gain of one gene  in eutherians. ncr <dig> has undergone lineage specific changes, having been lost from the opossum and non-functional in the mouse but the presence of this gene in the wallaby indicates that it was part of the inflammatory region prior to marsupial/eutherian divergence. the stability of this region in mammals over the past  <dig> million years suggests that the maintenance of these genes in a cluster may be functionally important.

evolution of the mhc class iii region
comparison of the inflammatory region of the wallaby mhc class iii with that of other vertebrates indicates that extensive evolutionary changes occurred early in vertebrate evolution, but were followed by a lengthy period of evolutionary stability. we have shown that many of the genes making up the inflammatory region of the eutherian mhc have been clustered for at least  <dig> million years. frog nfkbil <dig>  lta, tnf, ltb and bat <dig>  bat <dig>  apom are in the same transcriptional orientation as in mammals, although there have been several rearrangements in this region. the gene rsg <dig>  located between ltb and bat <dig>  moved to a different chromosome and the lst <dig> gene was inserted in eutherians. ncr <dig> and aif <dig> appear to have been lost in some lineages. bat <dig> and atpv1g <dig> have moved and changed transcriptional orientation.

the three genes tnf, lta and ltb of the eutherian tumour necrosis factor family genes are arranged in tandem, with tnf and lta in the same transcriptional orientation and ltb in the opposite orientation. this formation is conserved, even in marsupials, suggesting that there may be some functional advantage to this arrangement. the proteins encoded by tnf, lta and ltb are known to interact as complementary factors in various cell signalling networks  <cit> . hence, the maintenance of this gene arrangement may serve to facilitate co-ordinated regulation of these genes.

the absence of genes from some lineages does not necessarily mean that the functions of these genes are lost. for instance, chicken lacks tnf, but the its paralogue  appears to function as a tnf substitute  <cit> . likewise, in the lineages that lack the allograft inflammatory factor aif <dig>  a paralogue may have assumed its function. aif <dig> is a cytokine-responsive, calcium binding protein, shown to play a role in allograft rejection  <cit>  and in the inflammatory response following injury  <cit> . an orthologue of this gene was identified in eutherians, marsupials and pufferfish but not chicken, frog or zebrafish. a paralogue of this gene  is found on human chromosome  <dig> and is also present in chicken and frog, flanked by other human chromosome  <dig> genes. this gene may take over the role of aif <dig> in lineages where aif <dig> has been lost.

our analyses suggest that eight genes within the inflammatory region have remained tightly clustered for at least  <dig> million years, predating the divergence of the amphibian lineage. the linkage of tnf, lta , apom, and bat <dig>  predates the divergence of teleosts and mammals some  <dig> million years ago and is consistent with a functional significance of clustering of genes involved in inflammation. chicken is the exception, with no inflammatory region orthologues identified but it is likely that paralogues of these genes perform their function.

sequence conservation
genome comparisons between evolutionary diverse species have proven particularly useful for detecting conserved sequences, which may be functionally important. older pairwise methods for detecting sequence conservation  required the careful selection of species to avoid biasing predictions by including closely related species . more recent methods take the phylogenetic relationship of species into account to reduce or eliminate this bias . however, when using these methods, careful species selection is still important. as with pairwise methods, there is a trade-off between alignability and evolutionary depth. also, including too many species that lack a gene or region of interest will reduce the sensitivity of conserved element prediction.

marsupials are extremely well placed phylogenetically for the analysis of the inflammatory region, which is highly conserved amongst eutherians, but completely absent from the chicken genome. we found that the frog inflammatory region, while reasonably well conserved in terms of gene content, does not align well to the mammalian inflammatory region in non-coding regions. in teleosts, the inflammatory region is split over different chromosomes and obtaining a high quality alignment outside of coding regions is extremely difficult.

we searched the highly gene dense mhc class iii region for conserved elements using phastcons, an approach that utilizes a phylogenetic hidden markov model. we identified  <dig> conserved elements covering  <dig>  bp or  <dig> % of the region. siepel et al.  <cit>  used this approach to identify conserved elements in genomes of five vertebrates . they found  <dig>  million conserved elements covering  <dig> % of the human genome. thus we find roughly an eight-fold enrichment in the number of conserved elements in the inflammatory region and a four-fold increase in the proportion of sequence covered compared to a uniform distribution at this rate. the high density of conserved elements in this gene-rich region itself suggests that they have a function in regulation of the genes.

the ucsc genome browser "most conserved" track for the human genome  is based on a phastcons analysis of a human-referenced multiz alignment of  <dig> vertebrate species . it identifies  <dig> conserved elements, covering  <dig> bp, in the human inflammatory region. this is substantially less than the  <dig> elements, covering  <dig>  bp that we identified in human. examining the 17-way alignment of the inflammatory region reveals that only human, mouse, rat, dog and opossum are aligned substantially, with regions from chicken, x. tropicalis and t. nigroviridis aligning in smaller segments. thus, locally the sequence alignment contains fewer eutherians, only one marsupial and many sequence gaps from the non-mammals. it is likely that the deeper phylogenetic coverage and fewer mammalian sequences  make the ucsc phastcons analysis less sensitive for small mammal-specific conserved elements. this demonstrates that, while the ucsc genome browser is an excellent resource for comparative genomics, there is still some role for careful selection of species, taking the biology into account, when analysing sequence conservation.

the proportion of exonic and intronic sequence in the inflammatory region that is covered by conserved elements is much higher  than the genomic averages   <cit> , reflecting the high conservation of the inflammatory region. this is true of all annotation classes except the utr class, which is poorly resolved, and contains a lower proportion of conserved bases because the amount of sequence in this class was over-estimated. due to the high conservation together with the high gene density of this region, a much larger proportion of conserved elements occur in exons  and a much lower proportion in intragenic regions  than the genomic averages .

we calculated the pairwise similarity of sequences within phastcons-predicted conserved sequences. this simple post hoc analysis lacks the sophistication employed in the original prediction, but was effective in stratifying conserved elements into different classes and revealing clade-specific features in the eutherian and marsupial lineages. these elements are likely to include known and novel repeats, sequence retro-transposed into the region after the divergence of eutherians and marsupials, clade-specific features in proteins and clade-specific regulatory regions. such clade-specific elements could be evolutionarily important, as changes in gene regulation, rather than gene products, are likely to play a major role in the phenotypic differences between marsupials and eutherians  <cit> . new methods are now emerging that incorporate the phylogeny into the prediction of conserved elements and identify lineage-specific elements  <cit> .

conserved regulatory elements
it is important to categorize conserved elements based on their different patterns of molecular evolution to gain insight into the potential function of the element  <cit> . there are  <dig> conserved elements within  <dig> kb upstream and  <dig> within a  <dig> kb of the 3' end of any annotated gene. whereas regulatory regions can occur further up- and downstream from genes, as well as within introns, these closer elements are the best candidates for transcription factor binding sites and regulatory modules. indeed, the previously identified conserved element upstream of tnf  with 65–70% sequence identity between wallaby and eutherian sequences and 86% identity between wallaby and opossum  <cit> , contains the known human and mouse regulatory module of tnf consisting of three est-1/elk- <dig>  a jun-atf <dig>  three nfat and a sp- <dig> binding site  <cit> .

tnf is a cytokine involved in the regulation of a diverse spectrum of biological processes such as cell proliferation, lipid metabolism, apoptosis, and coagulation. an excess of tnf results in harmful inflammatory responses  <cit> , whereas under-expression for tnf has been shown to contribute to pathogen susceptibility  <cit> . tnf has been implicated in an array of diseases including autoimmune disease and cancer. a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms  within the promoter have disease associations. a snp at position - <dig> is associated with a susceptibility to papillovirus 16-associated cervical cancer  <cit> . the conserved element we identified encompassing this - <dig> polymorphic site may therefore be important to the regulation of tnf transcription. many other snps have been reported in the promoter region of tnf, some with disease associations, but there are conflicting reports in the literature on whether these polymorphisms have a significant effect of tnf expression  <cit> . recognition of conserved elements will assist in identifying snps in the tnf promoter that are likely to be functionally important.

disease associated snps are not limited to protein coding sequence or upstream elements but can also be found within introns. a snp within intron  <dig> of human lta enhances the transcriptional level of this gene, indicating that it is important for its transcriptional regulation  <cit> . individuals with this allele have been shown to have an increased susceptibility to myocardial infarction as well as large-vessel-associated ischemic stroke  <cit> . as more disease association studies are carried out on the inflammatory region genes, it becomes increasingly important to identify sequences which are potentially important to gene function and regulation so that functional disease associations can be detected. by cataloguing conserved elements within this region it should be easier to correlate snps with functionally important sequences.

CONCLUSIONS
we have constructed a rich dataset of mammalian sequence from the well-conserved mhc class iii inflammatory region and used comparative methods to study its evolution and analyse its sequence conservation. our results confirm the power gained by using two distantly related marsupial species in comparative studies.

the wallaby genes in this region are highly conserved in organisation and sequence relative to known eutherian sequences. analyses across taxa show that the linkage of tnf, lta , apom and bat <dig> predates the divergence of teleosts and mammals some  <dig> million years ago, consistent with the functional importance of the clustering of mhc genes.

we have examined the character of sequence conservation in the mammalian inflammatory region and identified clade-specific elements. this is a necessary first step towards identifying new regulatory elements, and may prove useful for linking snps associated with disease susceptibility to gene function.
