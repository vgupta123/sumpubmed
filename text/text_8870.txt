BACKGROUND
ancient and now highly specialized associations with bacterial symbionts are widespread in invertebrate groups that feed on nutrient-poor diets  <cit> . such associations are common in insects, in which the best studied symbiotic system is that of aphids  and their primary symbiont buchnera aphidicola  <cit> . buchnera, which has not been established in laboratory cultures, inhabits specialized host cells , is required for nutrition  and has been strictly vertically transmitted from mother to offspring for the last  <dig> million years  <cit> . in addition to being the best studied insect-symbiont system  <cit> , aphids are of general interest due to their economic and agricultural status as plant pests and plant disease vectors  <cit>  and their complex life cycles with multiple developmental pathways and parthenogenesis  <cit> .

the pea aphid acyrthosiphon pisum  will be one of the first insect species outside of the holometabola to serve as a model system in genomics  <cit> . currently, little is known about gene expression in this newly emerging model organism. in addition, it is already clear from the growing collection of aphid ests that aphids possess many genes that are absent from drosophila and other holometabolous insect taxa  <cit> . accurate and successful interpretation of the a. pisum genome sequence will depend critically on studies of gene expression under different environmental conditions, in different tissues and morphs, and at different developmental stages  <cit> .

the complete genome sequences are now available for the buchnera from three aphid species  <cit> , including a. pisum  <cit> . facilitated by these genome sequences and other studies, buchnera has become a model for studying the evolution of symbiotic and pathogenic lifestyles in bacteria  <cit> .

in the present study we take a metagenomic approach  <cit>  to examining transcriptional responses to heat shock in a host/symbiont system, using pooled rna samples and a microarray containing gene sets from both organisms. select results were verified with reverse-transcriptase quantitative pcr . to our knowledge, this dual-genome microarray is the first used to examine simultaneously the pooled transcriptome of an animal host and its symbiont; a previous dual-genome array has been used to study rhizobium-plant interactions  <cit> .

the transcriptional response to heat shock has been well characterized in other buchnera  <cit>  and in other insects  <cit> , enabling us to generate a priori predictions and thus to assess the success of our array design. further, aphids are highly sensitive to heat, with considerable variation among species . part of this sensitivity stems from the intolerance of the resident symbionts to high temperature. aphid lineages can be rendered infertile as a consequence of heat-induced elimination of their resident buchnera  <cit> , and field populations of a. pisum exposed to naturally occurring high temperatures undergo a decline in the number of bacteriocytes, reflecting the decline of the buchnera population within heat-stressed aphid hosts  <cit> . thus, the overall thermal tolerance of this symbiotic system is dependent on both host and symbiont responses to thermal challenge.

to date, there are no published studies on heat shock responses of any aphid genes. previously, wilcox et al.  <cit>  studied gene expression under heat shock in buchnera derived from the aphid schizaphis graminum and identified a set of nine genes that were significantly upregulated. six of the nine genes, mopa , mopb , dnaj, dnak, grpe, and ibpa are heat shock genes in other bacteria such as the related species escherichia coli and are known to function in the recycling and refolding of degraded proteins. two additional genes, fpr and the pseudogene of yjea, showed elevated transcript levels following heat shock. both are positioned immediately downstream of ipba and its Ïƒ <dig> heat shock promoter, and their response reflects transcriptional read-through based on reverse transcriptase quantitative pcr assays of different regions of the transcripts  <cit> .

RESULTS
heat shock response in buchnera of a. pisum
overall, the set of genes responding to heat shock in the buchnera of a. pisum is similar to the set previously identified in the buchnera of s. graminum  <cit> . in both, the following genes belonging to the e. coli heat shock  regulon were significantly upregulated: dnak, mopa , mopb , ibpa and dnaj .  in buchnera of both aphid species, yjea is downstream of ibpa and fpr, but encoded on the opposite strand. our results show an increase in yjea transcript with heat shock in buchnera of a. pisum, as described for buchnera of s. graminum. because the microarray probes consist of double-stranded amplicons, the most likely interpretation is that the heat-shock induced transcription of ibpa continues through both fpr and yjea, resulting in elevated transcription of the non-coding strand of yjea . we verified this explanation for yjea transcription under hs through targeted rt-pcr of a region overlapping ibpa, fpr, and the complement of yjea , using the same approach applied to buchnera of s. graminum  <cit> .

in addition to the heat-responsive genes identified for buchnera of s. graminum  <cit> , two other buchnera probes showed increased signal following hs : est <dig> , flagellum-specific atp synthase and est <dig> , 5-methyltetrahydropteroyltriglutamate-homocysteine s-methyltransferase. the gene mete was present as two types of probe: one, est <dig>  showed consistent increase in signal under hs, and the other, a directly amplified product from genomic dna, did not respond. our interpretation is that the spot corresponding to est <dig> was contaminated with some other sequence, and that mete is not responding.

signal from several buchnera genes was decreased following hs . these include arok, mray, cysj, cara and cysq. of these, cara also showed down-regulation under hs in the study of buchnera of s. graminum  <cit> .

using rt-qpcr, to investigate the accuracy of our microarray results for a select set of eight buchnera genes, we found good congruence between methods, using the non-hs genes argg and cysg as controls .

while the set of genes responding under hs corresponded to the set identified for buchnera of s. graminum, the magnitude of response was much larger for buchnera of a. pisum, both from the microarray and the rt-qpcr estimates. the hs treatment was the same for both studies; yet, expression changes ranged from under 2-fold to 13-fold in buchnera of s. graminum  <cit>  compared with 5-fold to 70-fold in buchnera of a. pisum .

heat shock response in a. pisum
two paralogs of the hs gene, hsp <dig>  were included on the array, one derived from a pcr product amplified from genomic dna  and the other derived from an est . both showed greater than 16-fold increase in transcript abundance under hs . seven other genes  showed large fold-changes and/or statistically significant changes in gene expression under hs conditions.

we investigated the accuracy of our microarray results using rt-qpcr for eight a. pisum genes representing a range of responses on the array. two of these showed no change on the array and were used as control genes  and est <dig> ), and both control genes gave similar results. we found good congruence between microarray and rt-qpcr methods for aphid est  <dig>  . however, rt-qpcr indicated no significant change in relative expression for five of the aphid ests that showed either upregulation  or down-regulation  under hs. this indicates that expression of the designated gene , does not change under hs. two explanations are  that a paralogous gene is undergoing change in expression giving cross-hybridization on the array but not giving pcr product because of the greater stringency of the rt-qpcr and  that there is contamination of the arrayed spots attributable to splash during transfers to the microtiter plates or carry-over of the array pins.

to discriminate between these two possibilities, we performed a dye-flip microarray hybridization experiment using samples differing only in the presence or absence of added amplicons of known hs genes represented on the array. rna representing the transcript pool of aphids under control conditions was divided into two portions, one spiked with amplicons of four upregulated buchnera genes  and one spiked with the amplicon of an upregulated aphid gene . two of the five aphid genes that showed incongruent results  did not change expression in the spike experiment. this indicates that the observed microarray results from the hs experiment cannot be explained as the result of contamination among probes on the array. instead, they likely reflect cross-hybridization of closely related gene transcripts  <cit> .

non-target sequences with >70% sequence identity can cross-hybridize to cdna probes  <cit> . this is illustrated on our array, which contains three members of the aphid hsp <dig> gene family; hsp <dig>  which was amplified using pcr primers from genomic dna for inclusion on this array and for which we have a cloned pcr product; est <dig>  which was isolated from est libraries  and est <dig> , which shows homology to hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> from other insect taxa and did not show significant upregulation under hs conditions . pcr primers designed to est <dig> do not amplify our cloned hsp <dig> product or est15; however, in the spike experiment, hsp <dig> pcr product hybridized to itself and to both the est <dig> and est <dig> probes . similarly, expression changes in paralogous genes are the most evident explanation for the change in signal of est <dig> and est <dig> . the final two aphid ests, est <dig> and est <dig>  did show significant "upregulation" in the spiked pools . the est <dig> probe cross-hybridized with hsp <dig> and the est <dig> probe with one of the four buchnera genes. we could not find any significant stretches of sequence similarity to explain these results, suggesting that these probes were contaminated. the est <dig> and est <dig> results are most readily attributable to splash on the microtiter plates. however, results from the spike experiment  clearly indicate that apparent upregulation of wg, wnt <dig> and dll ) resulted from pin carryover of the hsp <dig> probe during the printing process. the same pin stamped hsp <dig>  dll, wg and wnt <dig>  in that order.

usefulness of est-based microarrays for functional annotation of the aphid genome
these results suggest that, in addition to hsp <dig>  paralogs of est <dig> and of est <dig> undergo significant upregulation under hs. both have homologs in many other taxa, but we found no reports of involvement in the hs response in other organisms. est <dig> shows significant homology to tyrosyl-trna synthase from homo sapiens, mus musculus and drosophila virilis, while est <dig> is homologous to the gene encoding the molybdenum cofactor of sulfurase in bombyx mori, bos taurus and homo sapiens. molybdenum cofactor sulfurase is responsible for xanthine dehydrogenase activation in various organisms, a gene which plays a critical role in nitrogen metabolism, especially in insects  <cit> . our results suggest that genes that share significant sequence similarity to these two ests have a function in the heat stress response in aphids.

CONCLUSIONS
one of the outstanding questions in host/symbiont systems is how gene expression in the partner organisms is coordinated. est studies of aphid bacteriocytes have shown elevated expression of genes associated with a range of cellular functions including amino acid metabolism, cell transport, and antibacterial activity  <cit> . the presence of these functional categories at high frequency in bacteriocyte est libraries highlights important aspects of genome coordination between symbiont and host. further progress in understanding how and when these genes are upregulated and the roles they play in mediating the symbiosis will require extensive expression studies using arrays such as the one we describe here.

we have demonstrated the feasibility of using a dual-genome microarray to simultaneously study the expression profile of an aphid and its obligate bacterial symbiont. the success of this approach is dependent on the relative abundances of transcripts from the partner organisms. buchnera occurs in large numbers within aphids; their genomes constitute about 5â€“10% of total dna content  <cit> . a quantitative pcr study of gene copy number in intact adult pea aphids indicated a ratio of approximately  <dig>  single copy buchnera genes for each single copy aphid gene . this estimate is consistent with previous estimates of genome sizes of the two organisms and of the proportion of total dna belonging to buchnera  <cit> . thus, we expected transcript abundances of buchnera and aphid genes to be comparable, enabling hybridization of the pooled sample on the same array without loss of signal for either organism. use of a dual-genome array for the study of symbiosis in systems where symbionts are found in low copy number, e.g. wolbachia, the facultative bacterial endosymbiont of drosophila and other insects  <cit> , is likely to prove more difficult. however, many animals, including many other insects and marine invertebrates, do possess large numbers of obligate primary symbionts. in these composite organisms, an understanding of the integration of component genomes requires the synchronous examination of gene expression in each member.

finally, our results for the pea aphid genes suggest that the pea aphid genome may contain many gene paralogs that are differentially regulated. preliminary analysis from an est project suggests that the pea aphid genome may contain many gene duplications  <cit> . this fact will complicate analysis of differential gene expression in pea aphids using cdna microarrays, and suggests that establishing the differential regulation of specific genes will require qpcr. the full extent of gene paralogy in the pea aphid will soon be revealed by whole genome sequencing  <cit> .
