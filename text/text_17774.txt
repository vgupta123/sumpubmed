BACKGROUND
identifying cis-acting functional genetic and epigenetic factors affecting rna expression from trans-acting influence remains challenging. two approaches have emerged to offset the influence of trans-acting factors, in search of causative cis-acting factors. the first approach uses large sample sizes  to dissect the influence of trans- versus cis-acting factors influencing expression by correlating rna transcript expression, as a quantitative trait, with single-nucleotide polymorphisms  genotyped with genome-wide arrays. correlations between rna expression levels and snps yield expression quantitative trait loci  located in cis  or trans  and have been examined across a variety of tissues  <cit> . eqtl analysis still leaves some ambiguity regarding the cis- or trans-acting nature of a polymorphism, as cis-acting factors can be hundreds of kilobases away from the genes they regulate  <cit> . as an alternative to eqtl analyses, our group and others have utilized allelic rna expression imbalance , which compares the relative expression of two alleles in the same individual as a phenotype influenced only by cis-acting genetic variants  <cit> . because aei is an accurate and sensitive phenotype proximal to the functional genetic variant, this approach facilitates the detection of cis-acting regulatory polymorphisms affecting any mechanism that measurably changes rna expression, even when those polymorphisms reside at a distance from the affected gene or in regions of high linkage disequilibrium  <cit> . allelic rna expression ratios, when measured specifically in splice variants or alternatively expressed untranslated regions, can identify genetic variants affecting rna processing  <cit> . in addition to identifying cis-acting regulatory variants, aei is a powerful phenotype for assessing the extent of rna editing  <cit> , loss-of-heterozygosity or monoallelic expression in cancer  <cit> , and allele-specific epigenetic programming  <cit> . for example, directly measuring allelic-specific rna expression in brain tumors revealed a dramatic increase in monoallelic expression of multiple oncogenes, the extent of which correlated with tumor progression and prognosis  <cit> .

genome-wide allelic rna expression ratio measurements are possible by adapting genotyping array technology for quantitative measurement, demonstrating high sensitivity for detecting aei in human cell lines and peripheral blood cells  <cit> . multiple researchers have since used this genome-wide approach to uncover cis-acting regulatory variants in a variety of tissues  <cit> . however, array-based quantitative allelic analyses lacks the ability to measure aei at rare or de novo snps and yields limited information about transcript isoform expression. the advent of massively parallel dna sequencing technologies presents an opportunity to collect qualitative and quantitative aspects of gene expression in a single experiment, including splice isoform expression, genetic variants, cis-eqtls, rna editing, and allelic ratios  <cit> . however, significant experimental and analytic challenges need to be addressed and results compared to traditional methods before rna-seq is deemed a reliable complement  to existing allelic measurement techniques.

previous characterizations of allelic ratios using rna-seq are subject to a number of caveats, most notably high read depth requirements  <cit>  and underrepresentation of variant versus reference alleles  <cit>  resulting from alignment algorithms penalizing variant alleles as mismatching errors when compared to the reference genome. bioinformatic attempts to correct variant allele underrepresentation bring allelic ratios closer to unity and result in a higher number of mapped reads  <cit> , but may not increase reliability of allelic ratio estimates  <cit> . incorporating genomic information into allelic ratio measurements, for example by normalizing allelic rna expression ratios to matched dna ratios or by constructing personalized reference genomes for mapping, greatly improves allelic rna ratio estimates  <cit> . still, allelic expression ratios measured by rna-seq are yet to be systematically compared against targeted allelic expression methods to determine the reliability of rna-seq to measure allelic ratios. here, we measured allelic rna expression ratios in  <dig> autopsied brain regions from a single individual, using multiple alignment strategies and comparing rna-seq derived allelic ratios with a highly sensitive allelic quantitation method . after identifying factors affecting allelic ratio estimates by rna-seq, we extrapolated our methods with varying stringency to a new set of whole-transcriptome rna-seq samples from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex  of  <dig> different individuals, identifying tens to hundreds of genes displaying aei in more than one individual, indicative of frequent cis-acting regulatory variants. a number of these genes have evidence for harboring functional variants from cis-eqtl studies. in addition to identifying genes harboring likely cis-acting functional polymorphisms, we also surveyed sites of known rna editing, asking whether we observed greater variability across brain regions in a single individual or across multiple individuals in the same brain region, shedding light on the degree to which rna editing is regulated in the brain.

RESULTS
allelic rna expression ratios across different alignment methods
tissue characteristics and mapping statistics from  <dig> solid sequencing  in the  <dig> brain tissues are presented in table  <dig>  we used the ovation rna-seq system v <dig>  for cdna synthesis, which provides coverage at non-coding  and non-polyadenylated rna transcripts in addition to protein-coding mrnas while reducing ribosomal rna conversion to cdna. given the known alignment biases in allelic rna expression ratios in rna-seq  <cit> , we compared allelic ratios at heterozygous exonic snps following three different alignment methods: 1) alignment to the standard ncbi build 37/hg <dig> reference genome, after which reference allele counts were directly compared to variant allele counts, 2) a targeted allele-switching method requiring construction of a new “reference” genome whereby the wild-type nucleotide at  <dig> snp locations in  <dig> genes in ncbi build 37/hg <dig> were replaced with the variant nucleotide , remapped, and corresponding “reference” allele counts from both alignments used to calculate allelic ratios, and 3) a single genome-wide alignment using a modified hg <dig> reference genome that incorporates international union of pure and applied chemistry  ambiguity codes at snp locations catalogued in dbsnp build  <dig>  after which reference allele counts were directly compared to variant allele counts. construction of an “enhanced reference genome” by adding additional loci incorporating polymorphic sites is also a viable alternative  <cit> , as is the use of personal genomes where polymorphic sites are known  <cit> , or directly sequencing the genomic dna  <cit> , although these were not explicitly tested here.

using either alignment method that was applied in a genome-wide manner , the number of snps  available for allelic ratio analysis diminishes exponentially, as higher allelic depth is required . we limited comparisons across the three methods to those heterozygous snps where allelic ratio measurements were present in all three methods, for a total of  <dig> independent measures across  <dig> snps in  <dig> genes, with depth ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> reads per snp . to estimate the magnitude of allelic ratio correction, log-transformed allelic ratios from both correction methods  were regressed against the log-transformed allelic ratios from standard alignment . iupac and allele-switch corrected data performed similarly, each reducing allelic ratio estimates compared to standard alignment .

allelic rna expression ratios across cdna synthesis methods measured with snapshot
the two cdna synthesis approaches used here are methodologically different. gene-specific priming  is a strand-specific strategy, while nugen is strand-independent and more similar to random hexamer priming. divergent allelic ratios between these two methods can result from an admixture of plus and minus strand-encoded rna transcripts in the nugen cdna, while gsp cdna enriches for only one strand, compelling a direct comparison between the two methods. for this comparison, we individually measured allelic rna expression ratios at  <dig> different snps in  <dig> genes using snapshot, for a total of  <dig> comparisons across the  <dig> tissues . overall, log-transformed allelic ratios using the two cdna syntheses were highly correlated , although nugen cdna tended to yield higher allelic ratios, on average . importantly, when aei was indicated in the gsp cdna , nugen cdna also indicated aei > <dig>  for  <dig> of  <dig> snps. similarly, when allelic ratios were < <dig>  in gsp cdna, nugen cdna aei were also < <dig>  at  <dig> of  <dig> snps. the general agreement in allelic ratios between the two cdna synthesis methods indicates that the nugen cdna synthesis method used to produce the rna-seq libraries yields allelic ratios similar to those obtained with gene-specific priming.

rna-seq allelic rna expression ratios compared to snapshot
next, we compared allelic ratios resulting from any of the three alignment methods  to the single-gene snapshot measures of allelic expression . because we do not know the haplotype phasing of our samples, all allelic ratios were transformed to positive allelic ratio values using the formula |log10|, which ensures uniformity of snps with ambiguous strand alignment  and allows multiple allelic ratios in the same gene to be combined. for example, 2-fold and  <dig> -fold allelic ratios at different snps in the same gene both represent a 2-fold relative difference between alleles and yield a 2-fold allelic ratio when combined within that gene.

allelic ratios, when compared at single snps, were similarly correlated between iupac- or allele-switch ratios versus either nugen or gsp snapshot measures, while standard allelic ratios from rna-seq were much less correlated with either snapshot measure . these correlations dramatically improved across all alignment methods, when allelic ratios were averaged at multiple snps in the same gene, although allelic ratios from the standard alignment were still much less correlated with snapshot measures .

attempts at linear modeling, performed as a meta-analysis comparing ratios from the different methods using the metafor r package  <cit> , did not return the theoretically expected level of agreement between observed allelic ratios from any alignment methods when compared against snapshot in either cdna synthesis method . therefore, we considered pairwise logistic models  as an empirical meta-analytic approach for predicting whether rna-seq allelic ratios by any alignment method would meet a ≥ <dig> -fold threshold by our snapshot method in either nugen or gsp libraries. comparisons were only performed where corresponding data were present for both methods. rna-seq allelic ratios were converted into a logit score: log , which was used as a predictor in each model . overall, the iupac alignment produced the best predictions by akaike information criterion , while standard alignment performed the worst . for iupac ratios compared to snapshot ratios in the gsp library, the inclusion of two covariates with the logit gave the best aic value: the number of additional snps in in the gene times the logit  and the heterogeneity among the allelic ratios as reported by the r meta-analysis. for iupac ratios compared to snapshot ratios in the nugen library, these covariates did not decrease the aic, consistent with overfitting, although they also do not result in a significantly different aic score when included in the model. alternative approaches, including incorporation of error estimates or derivatives as covariates, did not improve the performance of the predictor. therefore, based on logistic regression, iupac allelic ratios resulted in a better model fit for allelic ratios measured by snapshot in either cdna synthesis method.

alignment correction applied across the whole transcriptome
given similar ratios between the two alternative alignment methods and the results of our meta-analytic approach, we employed the iupac method on a transcriptome-wide basis in the  <dig> different brain regions . after transcriptome-wide iupac alignment, we compared any annotated snp in which both alleles had a depth of at least  <dig> reads  and the lower expressed allele constituted at least 5% of total reads at the snp, for a total of  <dig>  snps in  <dig> genes across the  <dig> tissues. while  <dig> total reads is well below the number necessary for determining statistically significant aei at any one snp  <cit> , at this point we are testing the implementation of the iupac alignment across the entire dataset for obvious bias. the magnitude of allelic ratio correction by iupac alignment versus the standard alignment was similar to that observed in the smaller dataset above . in the iupac-aligned dataset, fewer snps were above a given allelic ratio threshold as compared to standard alignment , decreasing in both datasets in an exponential fashion as allelic ratios increase. this alone has significant implications for examining allelic rna expression ratios following standard alignment. when comparing the number of snps displaying allelic ratios > <dig> between alignment methods, we see a 30-50% reduction in the number of snps in iupac versus standard alignment. therefore, the number of snps displaying allelic ratios with potential biological consequence is greatly overestimated just as a consequence of standard alignment methods.

as before, we combined allelic ratios at multiple snps in the same gene to attenuate error in single snp allelic ratios. similar to the single snp analysis, the overall number of genes displaying allelic ratios above  <dig> is considerably higher in the standard versus iupac dataset. when only requiring one snp,  <dig>  gene × tissue combinations were represented in this analysis, with allelic ratios ranging from 1- to  <dig> -fold. requiring more than one snp per gene reduces the number of gene x tissue combinations for analysis to  <dig>  and also reduces the number of genes displaying major allelic ratios greater than 5-fold . we observe  <dig> gene × tissue combinations with ≥2-fold allelic ratios for iupac alignment, as compared to  <dig> combinations for standard alignment. of the  <dig> iupac ratios ≥ <dig>   <dig>  were represented in the standard alignment dataset. restricting the analysis to snps with at least  <dig> counts per allele and genes with at least  <dig> measurements only marginally increases coincidence of genes with allelic rna expression ratios ≥ <dig> between the two alignment methods . so, not only do the two methods give different allelic ratio estimates, but they also produce gene pools that are only 66% similar for allelic ratios ≥ <dig>  increasing stringency in this manner also does not appear to improve the accuracy of estimated allelic ratios when compared to snapshot. five of the  <dig> genes that overlap between iupac and standard alignment  with allelic ratios ≥ <dig> in the iupac dataset were measured with snapshot and only one had allelic ratios ≥ <dig> .

the variability of allelic rna expression ratios across multiple snps in a single gene is another metric that can guide our search for allelic expression imbalance. to further eliminate likely false-positives indicated by high within-gene allelic ratio variability, we can ask whether any gene-wise allelic ratio remains above a certain threshold after adjusting by the standard deviation for all snps within that gene. for example,  <dig> gene × tissue combinations  have an allelic rna expression ratio ≥ <dig>  after subtracting two standard deviations from the original allelic ratio. of those  <dig> genes × tissue combinations, we measured allelic ratios in  <dig> using snapshot,  <dig> of which displayed allelic ratios > <dig>  these strict requirements do exclude a number of samples where snapshot allelic ratios are ≥ <dig>  demonstrating the tradeoff between capturing aei with greater probability and allowing too many false positive allelic ratios.

allelic rna expression ratios across brain regions
now that we have characterized the sensitivity of rna-seq in detecting allelic ratios and have estimates of the false discovery rate as compared to our single-gene methods, we can begin to provide a meaningful interpretation of the allelic ratios observed across the  <dig> tissues. taking into account the factors that best improved concordance between rna-seq allelic ratios and those measured by snapshot, we used iupac aligned gene-wise allelic ratios averaged at multiple annotated snps, leaving us with the  <dig>  gene x tissue allelic rna expression ratios,  <dig> of which were ≥ <dig>  as noted above. we have chosen allelic ratios ≥ <dig> in these iupac-aligned samples as being indicative of aei. this allelic ratio value from iupac-aligned gene estimates should approximately correspond to a  <dig> -fold allelic ratio by snapshot, according to our analysis above.

one hundred forty-nine genes had allelic ratios measurable in all  <dig> brain regions by our methods, none of which displayed aei in all  <dig> tissues. two genes, nhp2l <dig> and slc1a <dig>  displayed aei in  <dig> regions and were consistent with snapshot allelic ratios. high allelic differences were also observed in the ninth region for each gene, but were not included in the overall analysis as the excluded tissues had only one informative snp for aei measurement. nhp2l <dig> encodes a protein that is a highly conserved component of the spliceosome, but the biological significance of altered mrna expression for this gene is unknown. slc1a <dig> is the high-affinity glial glutamate transporter . clinical phenotypes are evident for altered slc1a <dig> function, including ataxia or epilepsy, but this may be a consequence strictly resulting from protein-coding mutations, as known disease-linked mutations are presumed to act in a dominant negative fashion in the assembled homotrimeric transporter  <cit> . changes only to mrna expression, as seen in heterozygous slc1a <dig> knockout mice, do result in some behavioral abnormalities  <cit> , but the applicability of these findings to humans is unclear. the other genes exhibiting ubiquitous aei where measured included ank <dig>  edem <dig>  fam164a, loc <dig>  ptk2b, sc5dl, sec22b, tuba1c, and znf <dig> 

identifying common cis-acting regulatory variants in dlpfc
a primary purpose for measuring allelic ratios is to identify common cis-acting regulatory polymorphisms. extrapolating our findings to a set of  <dig> dlpfc rna-seq samples from different donors, which includes the dlpfc of the donor of the other  <dig> brain regions, we can begin to ask which genes exhibit evidence for harboring common cis-acting regulatory variants and further ask which genes show the strongest evidence. our approach includes not only protein-coding mrnas, but also ncrnas, which are gaining widespread appreciation for their cis-regulatory roles in gene expression and other important biological actions  <cit> . considering the high probability that snps alter the conformational properties of rna  <cit>  and the already known importance of structure-function relationships in large classes of ncrnas , the inclusion of ncrnas here presents interrogation of an additional layer of cis-acting regulation absent when only selecting protein-coding mrnas for rna-seq or subsequent analysis.

out of  <dig> samples, we expect to detect functional variants with a minimum heterozygosity of ~15%, assuming that  <dig> samples displaying aei in the same gene suggests a shared cis-acting functional variant. this analysis carries many caveats, including the assumption that only a single functional variant per gene is driving aei, that we are able to measure allelic ratios in the same gene in all  <dig> samples, and that these samples do not display batch effects or artifacts associated with the library preparations or sequencing methods. demographics and sequencing statistics are listed in table  <dig>

with a cutoff of at least  <dig> reads per allele  in annotated exonic snps following alignment with the iupac reference, we calculated allelic ratios at  <dig>  polymorphic sites across  <dig> genes and ncrnas in the  <dig> samples, for a total of  <dig>  snp x gene combinations. using permissive parameters, we asked which genes had ≥2-fold aei when averaged across multiple snps in the same gene and therefore show evidence for harboring a cis-acting regulatory variant. over half  of all genes were excluded from further analysis because none of the  <dig> samples had more than one informative allelic ratio. in the remaining  <dig> genes, we observe aei in more than one sample for  <dig> genes . specifically with respect to ncrnas, we calculated  <dig> allelic ratios in  <dig> unique transcripts, of which,  <dig> exhibited allelic ratios ≥ <dig> in two or more samples. we expect that in this analysis, we are likely overestimating the number of genes with aei, especially given the lack of power to detect statistically significant aei at low coverage  <cit> . in some cases, it is possible that aei observed in many samples for the same gene is an artifact driven by the presence of a pseudogene or another family member with high sequence homology. for example, the gene/pseudogene sec22b exhibits aei in all  <dig> tissues and also displayed aei where measured in each of the  <dig> brain regions. of the  <dig> genes with aei in  <dig> or more samples, only  <dig>  can be excluded from obvious interference by pseudogenes or highly homologous related family members. interference from homologous family members assumes both genes are expressed in the same tissue to a level detectable by rna-seq and does not necessarily disqualify putative aei without further study.

given our permissive parameters for designating aei and the possibility that gene homology is contributing to overrepresentation of aei, we increased the stringency for designating aei based on the variability of allelic ratios between snps in the same gene, to ask which genes have strong evidence for harboring cis-acting regulatory variants. as above, we subtracted two standard deviations of the within gene allelic ratios from the total gene allelic ratio for each sample and used a  <dig> -fold allelic ratio as a cutoff for designating aei. this yielded only  <dig> genes in which aei was observed in multiple samples . three of the  <dig> genes were the same as those identified by the permissive analysis as having associated pseudogenes or homologous family members. three of the  <dig> genes are identified as ncrnas, but we can only exclude one ncrna  from interference by pseudogenes or rna editing . cross-referencing these  <dig> genes with cis-eqtls identified by another study  <cit> ,  <dig> of the  <dig> genes where data is available exhibit evidence for harboring a common functional snp affecting rna expression . as another approach, we excluded genes in which the standard deviation between snps in the same gene was greater than one-third of the total allelic ratio for that gene, keeping a ≥2-fold threshold for aei. this analysis yielded  <dig> genes with putative aei,  <dig> of which had no significant homology with the rest of the transcriptome . with respect to rna editing described below, only par-sn and pdia3p exhibited significant aei  and evidence for rna editing.

surveying rna editing within and across brain regions
from these single base allelic ratios we can readily detect instances of rna editing, as one type of post-transcriptional modification, and survey the variability of editing at single sites and the extent to which they are edited across different brain regions and across different individuals in the dlpfc . in this analysis, dlpfc <dig> is included with the other  <dig> brain regions, as it originates from the same donor brain . we are specifically interested in determining whether rna editing is more variable across brain regions in a single individual or within a single brain region across many individuals. answering this question yields insight into the regulatory factors guiding this process. for example, greater variability across regions suggests that each region has a unique complement of trans-acting proteins guiding this process that is stable across individuals, while greater variability across individuals suggests that each region contains a common complement of trans-acting factors that can vary across individuals, among possible interpretations.

cross-referencing our rna-seq data with known rna editing sites from the database of rna editing in humans   <cit> , we find  <dig>  and  <dig>  sites noted in darned where we observe expression of the variant allele in the  <dig> different brain regions and  <dig> dlpfc, respectively . we applied stringent criteria  to maximize the likelihood we are capturing true instances of rna editing and also required at least  <dig> of  <dig> regions and  <dig> of  <dig> dlpfc to exhibit rna editing at any one site for comparisons, leaving only  <dig> rna editing sites in  <dig> genes . the magnitude of editing at each of the  <dig> sites is highly correlated  across the  <dig> regions and  <dig> dlpfc. in addition, the variability of rna editing is not significantly different within the  <dig> regions as compared to the  <dig> dlpfc, suggesting rna editing is tightly regulated at these  <dig> sites. these findings could be driven by our stringent criteria for designating rna editing sites, but other studies have found similarly consistent levels of intra- versus inter-individual adenosine-to-inosine editing  <cit>  and at greater depth in the brain  <cit> .

rna editing does impact some single-gene allelic ratio estimates. a total of  <dig> genes had annotated polymorphisms  where rna editing is also reported in darned, including  <dig> of the  <dig> genes exhibiting ≥2-fold aei in our less stringent analysis . four of these  <dig> genes would not meet criteria for aei analysis in one or more samples if the putative editing site was excluded, lacking the minimum  <dig> sites we required for allelic ratio estimates. four of the  <dig> remaining genes have at least one sample previously exhibiting ≥2-fold aei which now exhibits allele ratios <2-fold after excluding the putative rna editing sites.

CONCLUSIONS
the current study provides assessment of allelic rna expression with rna-seq in human brain tissues compared to a robust and accurate snapshot method we routinely apply to single-gene studies of aei. our two cdna synthesis methods produced similar allelic ratios, but large systematic allelic biases were evident using standard alignment methods. we find considerable variability in rna-seq derived allelic rna expression ratios, but also the ability to detect aei of various magnitudes, after adjusting for possible biases. two factors were crucial to improve allelic rna expression ratio measures by rna-seq; attenuating alignment bias and requiring more than one snp per gene when averaging allelic ratios at regions of low depth. we tested two read alignment methods for attenuating allelic bias, each with a different strategy to account for variant alleles. because use of the iupac nomenclature for biallelic snps yielded a closer to normal distribution of error than the other methods and was readily implemented in a single alignment strategy, we employed this technique on a transcriptome-wide basis for subsequent analyses. one potential drawback of alignment using the iupac reference genome is that it only provides ambiguity codes at snps annotated in db <dig> and is not usable by the widely-used tuxedo suite analysis package. however, novoalign http://www.novocraft.com/main/index.php), mosiak , and mira  are capable of alignments using genomes with ambiguity codes and are compatible with other sequencing platforms. given the widespread recognition of allelic bias in rna-seq data, the approach outlined here is one of many possibilities for alleviating this artifact  <cit> , but one particularly relevant for those utilizing lifescope software to map and analyze reads generated by solid sequencing.

by either correction method, we can substantially attenuate the reference alignment bias, showing that rna-seq data aligned with standard methods requires a much larger allelic ratio for confidently predicting aei. following standard alignment, only  <dig> annotated snps in  <dig> genes across all  <dig> tissues meet a  <dig> -fold threshold  when requiring at least  <dig> reads per allele. according to statistical inference, more than  <dig> reads are required to detect a  <dig> -fold allelic ratio at p <  <dig>   <cit> . considering that many of the genes we previously studied demonstrating phenotypic changes with allelic ratios of approximately  <dig>  to 2-fold would not meet this depth requirement, this level of stringency is severely limiting but necessary if rna-seq is used as the sole determinant of aei. in fact, even with permissive read requirements, brain-expressed genes we previously published as harboring cis-acting regulatory variants with our snapshot method were absent from our rna-seq analysis  <cit>  due to a lack of coverage, with the exception of htr2a <cit> . this illustrates an important, albeit obvious characteristic of rna-seq based analyses of allelic expression – that the ability to measure allelic ratios critically depends upon read depth. at present, modest- to low-expressing genes are more effectively interrogated by other means, such as snapshot or highly-multiplexed amplicon resequencing  <cit> . nonetheless, when used in combination with other methods, rna-seq is a valuable screening tool for identifying common cis-acting functional polymorphisms.

our analysis of ncrnas in this study found similar percentages of transcripts exhibiting aei across the dlpfc as compared to protein-coding mrnas, regardless of stringency. however, most of the ncrnas identified in the more stringent analyses have evidence for interference by pseudogenes, with the exception of linc <dig>  this ncrna is up-regulated in a uniform fashion in the brain relative to the rest of the body according to microarray analysis  <cit> , although a brain-specific role for this transcript is yet to be established. linc <dig> is alternatively spliced to produce at least  <dig> isoforms. encoded on the same strand in the 3′ end of three spliceoforms is microrna  <dig> , which has been associated with neuron-specific expression and neuronal differentiation during development  <cit> . aei at this locus could indicate differential processing of the alternative linc <dig> isoforms or mir9- <dig>  although these interpretations remain speculative. in either case, the widespread and high expression of this ncrna in the brain and the role of mir <dig> in neuronal development impel further study.

of particular importance to finding cis-acting functional variants is the ability to reliably detect aei at single snps, rather than requiring averaging across multiple snps in the same gene, as done here. single snp aei resolution allows interrogation of subtle aspects of gene regulation, if the snp resides in a differentially processed area of the transcript, such as between two different polyadenylation signals or in an alternative exon or untranslated region  <cit> . in fact, our single-gene studies have now identified two regulatory snps that are only detected by measuring aei in differentially expressed regions of the genes and are not apparent when measuring aei in constitutively expressed regions of the genes  <cit> . at present, multiple factors have improved the ability to measure allelic ratios at single snps in differentially processed areas of a transcript, including increasing read depth and incorporating the genomic makeup of the sample into statistical analyses  <cit> . the sensitivity of rna-seq to detect aei at single snps will likely continue to improve as read length increases, sequencing error rate decreases, and additional strategies are developed to account for variant alleles.

single snp analysis is necessary to evaluate post-transcriptional transcript modifications, such as rna editing. our survey of rna editing sites in the brain is consistent with previous reports of rna editing conducted at much greater depth  <cit> , suggesting that single position resolution of allelic rna expression ratios can be reliably measured at lower depth using rna-seq. further, the lack of variable editing across brain tissues and across individuals argues that rna editing in the brain is critically maintained at an optimal level, supported by observations of dysregulated rna editing in cancer  <cit> . the most obvious candidates for regulating this process globally are the adenosine deaminase enzymes, adar and adarb <dig>  although we find some correlation between mrna expression of adar or adarb <dig> and rna editing at these  <dig> sites, a more comprehensive analysis is necessary to further speculate on this relationship across the brain. while our study helps establish intra- and inter-individual differences in rna editing in the human brain, the speed and breadth of genomic sequencing technologies is driving studies of rna editing beyond simple quantitative levels, even revealing differences in subcellular editing events  <cit> . our studies and others make it evident that rna-seq advances our ability to interrogate multiple aspects of the transcriptome in a single experiment, including allelic rna expression ratios, as compared to single-gene approaches.
