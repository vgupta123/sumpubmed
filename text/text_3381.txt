BACKGROUND
the chicken is the first bird for which the complete genome was sequenced  <cit> , providing a new viewpoint on the evolution of vertebrate genomes and useful data for the annotation of the human genome by the detection of conserved sequences  <cit> . the chicken karyotype is typical of birds, with the presence of chromosomes of extreme differences in size, comprising  <dig> pairs of autosomes –  <dig> macrochromosomes ,  <dig> intermediate-sized chromosomes  and  <dig> microchromosomes – plus the z and w sex chromosomes. due to their very small size, microchromosomes cannot be identified by conventional cytogenetic techniques and require molecular labels, either bac clones or chromosome paints, for identification by fish   <cit> . as a consequence, despite the good overall quality of the chicken draft assembly, which benefited from the relatively small content of repeat sequences, a large fraction corresponding to  <dig> of the smallest microchromosomes was missing in the first version of the published sequence assembly   <cit> .

alongside the sequence contigs attributed to the numbered chromosomes identified on the cytogenetic map, some contigs were linked to four small linkage groups of the genetic map that have not yet been assigned to chromosomes and that were therefore suspected of belonging to microchromosomes yet to be identified. however, these linkage groups contain only very limited amounts of sequence, ranging from  <dig> kb , down to  <dig> kb   <cit> . finally, around  <dig> mb of sequence  were in the chrun fraction, which contains any contig sequence that was not assigned to a chromosome or a linkage group from the genetic map  <cit> . although a few supercontigs of the chrun were large, with eight greater than  <dig> kb each, none covered more than  <dig>  mb and most  were smaller than  <dig> kb  <cit> . the sizes of the smallest of the microchromosomes are difficult to estimate and various estimates, ranging from  <dig>   <cit>  to  <dig> mb  <cit>  have been given. it appears therefore that a substantial fraction of the chicken genome is absent from the present sequence assembly, which could explain the fact that a number of genes present in mammals appear to be absent in the current chicken sequence assembly  <cit> .

as a first step towards an improved sequence of the microchromosomes missing in the genome assembly, we started to build rh and genetic maps using markers developed from supercontigs selected from the chrun. to guide the choice of the supercontigs, three criteria were used. first, under the hypothesis that a substantial amount of sequence exists in the chrun for the missing microchromosomes and that these microchromosomes could correspond to regions of human chromosomes of substantial size by conservation of synteny, we selected supercontigs from the chrun that cluster in specific regions of human chromosomes by comparative genomics. second, as microchromosomes tend to have a high g+c content, the supercontigs were chosen likewise. the last criterion was to only consider supercontigs larger than  <dig> kb. amongst the several regions of human chromosomes meeting the three criteria, one on hsa <dig>  between positions 145– <dig> mb was selected to develop an rh and genetic map. a bac library was screened for markers suitable for fish mapping that could then be used to identify the microchromosome covered by our new map.

RESULTS
selection of chicken supercontigs for the development of markers
the chrun fraction of the february  <dig> assembly of the chicken genome is composed of  <dig>  supercontigs, whose sizes vary between less than  <dig> kb, up to  <dig>  mb. therefore, to work with a reasonable number of markers, we selected the  <dig> supercontigs whose sizes were larger than  <dig> kb. these were selected using the filter in the table browser . to obtain reliable indications on alignments of the chicken supercontigs in the human sequence, an intersection query was performed, requiring at least 20% overlap between the supercontigs and alignment net. only level  <dig> net chains, which are the largest and highest scoring, were considered. nine hundred and twelve supercontigs were thus selected. finally, we wanted to avoid working with supercontigs from the chrun that had a high similarity to known chicken chromosomes, as these could be due either to sequence fragments attributed to the chrun following assembly artefacts, or to duplicated segments of the chicken genome that could have confounded the mapping through the amplification of two or more loci. therefore, only supercontigs with a maximum of 20% self-overlap to the chicken sequence assembly, with level  <dig> alignment net, were retained. this resulted in a selection of  <dig> supercontigs .

the position of the human alignment net of the chicken supercontigs in the human genome was determined using the ucsc database and plots representing these positions were inspected to determine the regions in which they clustered. an example for hsa <dig> is included in figure  <dig>  regions of human chromosomes in which chicken supercontigs from the chrun tend to cluster are good candidates for regions of conserved synteny between the human and chicken genomes that were missed in the chicken assembly. as an additional criterion suggesting that supercontigs belonged to microchromosomes, we selected supercontigs with a high g+c content, since the g+c content is higher in microchromosomes than macrochromosomes  <cit>  .

finally, information from the ucsc browser was used to guide the development of markers, by avoiding regions in which the chicken sequence was of low quality, where it contained repeat elements or where it was 100% similar to the human sequence . this last criterion was used to avoid the amplification of the hamster dna in the rh clones.

as a test case for our strategy of marker selection, we chose to study  <dig> chicken supercontigs with high g+c content that were clustered in three regions of hsa <dig> . when inspecting human chromosome  <dig> in the ucsc browser in the three selected regions, a similarity to sequence from the chicken e26c <dig> linkage group was found in the chicken alignment chain and alignment net tracks around position  <dig>  mb of hsa <dig>  e26c <dig> is composed of sequence linked only to a linkage group of the genetic map  <cit> . as position  <dig>  mb of hsa <dig> is within the region in which most of the chicken chrun supercontigs clustered, we decided to also develop markers for e26c <dig> 

assignment of supercontigs to rh linkage groups
the markers developed for the  <dig> supercontigs and e26c <dig> were genotyped by pcr on the chickrh panel  <cit> , the results were submitted to the chickrh server  <cit>  and linkage groups were determined using the carthagene software  <cit> . two markers failed to produce satisfactory results,  <dig> markers corresponding to two regions of hsa <dig> mapped to the gga <dig> linkage group,  <dig> markers to gga <dig>   <dig> markers showed no linkage to a known chromosome or to a large linkage group and, finally,  <dig> markers were grouped into a new linkage group, together with  <dig> other markers from the chickrh server database . during the course of this work, the human sequence assembly was updated and the position of the supercontigs mapped in chicken by rh mapping was re-evaluated. as a result, the markers of gga <dig> that were dispersed in the human may  <dig> sequence assembly hg <dig>  are now grouped together in the human march  <dig> sequence assembly hg <dig> .

all the  <dig> markers of the new large linkage group, including the one from e26c <dig>  were developed from chicken supercontigs with sequence similarity to the region  <dig>  to  <dig> mb on hsa <dig> in the hg <dig> assembly and are now in the region  <dig> to  <dig> mb in hg <dig> . this 10-mb-long region of chromosome  <dig> seems thus to present conservation of synteny with a segment of the chicken genome that corresponds to the e26c <dig> linkage group of the genetic map, which was not linked to the karyotype. a first rh framework map built with  <dig> of the  <dig> markers of the e26c <dig> linkage group spanned  <dig> centirays  .

bac screening and assignment of e26c <dig> to gga <dig> by fish mapping
the wageningen bac library, which has a  <dig> -fold coverage of the genome  <cit> , was screened by pcr with  <dig> markers from the e26c <dig> rh linkage group: two ests , arhgef <dig> and copa, from the middle of the map and two stss , seq <dig> and seq <dig>  from each end. four clones: bw64m <dig>  bw64m <dig>  bw88f <dig>  bw90f <dig>  were obtained with arhgef <dig> and copa and no clones could be detected with the two other markers .

all four bac clones co-localised by two-colour fish to the same microchromosome, whose size could be estimated to be between chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  to identify the microchromosome to which the e26c <dig> linkage group corresponds, the bac bw90f <dig>  that gave the strongest hybridisation signal, was selected for hybridisation by two-colour fish with the clones that tag the microchromosome pairs of similar size, as described in masabanda et al  <cit> . to ensure a good coverage of microchromosomes in the size range of the one identified by bw90f <dig>  clone tags were used for microchromosomes gga <dig> to gga <dig>  with the exception of gga <dig>  for which no clone had yet been identified by the chicken cytogenetic community. for all combinations of tag clones used with bw90f <dig>  distinct signals on two different chromosome pairs were obtained , indicating that the e26c <dig> linkage group corresponds to gga <dig>  which was missing in the clone tag collection and by extension in the sequence assembly of the genome.

sequence and position information on the  <dig> markers of the first gga <dig> rh map were sent to wes warren and ladeana hiller  who integrated these data into the second assembly of the chicken genome, which was released in may  <dig>  this allowed the first attribution of sequence data to gga <dig>  the sequence assembly of gga <dig> in the second chicken genome build contains  <dig>  mb of attributed sequence and the coverage is just over  <dig> mb when including gaps. since the extension of the rh map , seven additional bac clones were obtained by screening the library with  <dig> other gga <dig> markers .

adding markers to the gga <dig> rh map
since we have now defined a region of conserved synteny between gga <dig> and hsa <dig>  additional markers were developed using this information. one hundred and five markers were developed from additional chrun contigs of shorter length than the ones selected for building the preliminary map. these were selected in the chicken  <dig> assembly with the ucsc browser using the criterion of an alignment with the region in hsa <dig> between 144– <dig> mb. thirty-four markers were developed from chicken est sequences orthologous to human genes from the same region, obtained from the ncbi  <cit>  or sigenae  <cit>  databases. interestingly,  <dig> of these est contigs did not present any similarity to the chicken genome assembly, suggesting they were missed in the whole genome sequencing process. two markers were developed from the gga <dig> assembly when it became available in march  <dig>  bac sequencing provided two markers and one marker was obtained from a charomid clone containing minisatellite marker lei <dig> present in the e36c <dig> genetic map . altogether,  <dig> primer pairs out of  <dig>  enabled successful amplification and the subsequent mapping of the corresponding fragments:  <dig> to gga <dig> and  <dig> to other chromosomes. with the addition of those new markers, the total number of markers now assigned to gga <dig> is  <dig>  after multipoint analysis, the framework map comprised a total of  <dig> markers for a length of  <dig>  cr the remaining  <dig> markers were integrated at their best possible locations, to build a comprehensive map . these new results allowed us to assign  <dig> additional contigs from the  <dig> chrun assembly to gga <dig> .

genetic markers and genetic map
sequence information from the markers on the gga <dig> rh map was used to develop genetic markers to build genetic maps. two maps were built: one based on one of our experimental populations and the other by using the east lansing  <cit>  chicken reference backcross mapping population, so as to integrate markers mapped by others. the markers informative in our experimental population enabled us to build a genetic map  <dig> cm long, comprising  <dig> framework markers . seven informative markers were added to the e26c <dig> linkage group in the east lansing genetic map. together with the data already available, e26c13-gga <dig> is now composed of  <dig> markers and is  <dig> cm long .

discussion
we used a strategy based on the comparative mapping of sequence contigs from the chrun fraction of the chicken genome and from chicken ests to characterize a chicken microchromosome that was absent from the first sequence assembly. isolation of bac clones and fish mapping enabled us to identify this microchromosome as being gga <dig>  although gga <dig> is now included in the second version  of the chicken genome assembly, our rh maps enabled us to assign  <dig> additional contigs from the chrun, amounting to a total of  <dig>  kb of sequence, and  <dig> ests that did not have any significant blast hit. genetic maps of gga <dig> were successfully developed by using the data from the rh maps.

the difficulty we encountered in isolating bac clones and the small size of many of the chrun contigs we attributed to gga <dig> suggest that there may be a cloning and/or a sequencing bias against obtaining sequence from microchromosomes. these difficulties in obtaining sequence have since been confirmed for other microchromosomes by us and others . the gga <dig> sequence in the may  <dig> assembly has a composition of  <dig> % g+c, which is amongst the highest for chicken chromosomes  <cit> . the chrun contigs that we have added to gga <dig> through rh mapping have a mean g+c content of  <dig> % . this confirms gga <dig> to be amongst the most gc-rich microchromosomes. the observation from fish experiments  <cit> , and the high proportion of minisatellite markers on the e26c <dig> genetic map  <cit> , suggest that gga <dig> contains a high number of repetitive sequences. both the high g+c content and a high proportion of repetitive elements may account for the paucity of available sequence for this chromosome in the chicken genome assembly at the beginning of this study.

an average retention frequency of  <dig> %  was observed for the  <dig> gga <dig> markers studied here. this finding is in agreement with previously observed values  <cit> , confirming a higher retention rate for micro – than for macrochromosomes.

by using the average value of  <dig>  kb/cr observed for other chromosomes mapped with the chickrh <dig> panel  <cit> , the length of gga <dig> can be estimated to be around  <dig>  mb, which is in accordance with the expected size for this chromosome  <cit> . this suggests also that the entire chromosome is covered by our rh map. the portion of human chromosome  <dig> orthologous to gga <dig>  located at hsa01q <dig> -q <dig> , is about  <dig>  mb long . this region corresponds to a chicken microchromosome covering about 11– <dig> mb, giving a ratio of about  <dig> mb hsa/ <dig> mb gga, which is much lower than the average ratio when considering the whole genome , and may be associated with the very high density of genes in this portion of the human genome  <cit> .

the hsa <dig> region orthologous to gga <dig> contains around  <dig> genes  <cit> . assuming most of these genes are present in gga <dig>  the gene density of this microchromosome would be  <dig>  genes/ <dig> kb, which is comparable to the value of  <dig>  obtained for gga <dig>  and higher than the ratio observed for longer chicken chromosomes, as expected  <cit> .

the rh results indicate a high number of chromosomal rearrangements in the chicken and human lineages in the region corresponding to gga <dig> . the high number of intra-chromosomal rearrangements within the region of conserved synteny between birds and mammals is in accordance with results obtained for other chromosomes, e.g., gga <dig>  <cit> , gga <dig>  <cit> , gga <dig>  <cit> , gga <dig>  <cit> , gga <dig>  <cit> , gga <dig>  <cit>  or gga <dig>  <cit> .

genotyping the east lansing population allowed us to connect our results to the international chicken reference backcross mapping pedigree, and to develop a single-locus marker from a minisatellite previously mapped in this population. these results suggest that minisatellite-type sequences are distributed throughout gga <dig> .

the genetic map constructed using our local cross presents smaller genetic distances between markers than the east lansing map. the variation observed are most likely the result of differences between the lines used for the two crosses. by using the genetic map built with our local cross, we find an overall ratio of  <dig>  cr/cm, which is a relatively low value when compared to the ratio obtained for chicken macrochromosomes  <cit> , but close to the ratio of  <dig>  obtained for chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . this result is in accordance with the fact that the recombination rate is negatively correlated with the physical length of the chromosome  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the availability of more than  <dig>  million single-nucleotide polymorphisms , and the improvement of genotyping methods, will lead to very dense genetic and rh maps in chicken. however, most of these snps are situated at known chromosomal locations in the chicken genome and a large effort is still needed to identify several microchromosomes which are still absent from the chicken genome map. the integrated strategy used here, by using comparative mapping and the sequence data currently assigned to the chrun as resources, along with using fish, rh and genetic mapping as complementary tools for the characterization of gga <dig>  may be a way to improve our knowledge of the gene-rich microchromosomes that as yet remain uncharacterized. strategies that include microdissection, flow sorting or magnetic-bead chromosome isolation may however be necessary to achieve this goal.
