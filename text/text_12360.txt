BACKGROUND
integral membrane proteins play a key role in detecting and conveying outside signals into cells, allowing them to interact and respond to their environment in a specific manner. they form principal nodes in hormonal and neuronal signaling and attract large interest in therapeutic interventions as the majority of drug targets are associated to the cell's membrane. although the human genome has been public for several years, the exact number and identity of all protein coding genes have been hard to determine  <cit> . one of the most referenced papers regarding the percentage of membrane proteins in proteomes is from  <dig> where the membrane topology prediction method tmhmm was applied on a number of proteomes from different species to estimate the membrane protein content, for example, caenorhabditis elegans , escherichia coli  and drosophila melanogaster   <cit> . however, the human or any other vertebrate's proteome was not included in this study. the original human genome sequence project estimated 20% of the total gene count of  <dig>  genes to code for membrane proteins  <cit> . more recently, four commonly used membrane topology prediction methods were applied to the human proteome  <cit> . based on the range of predictions by the different methods  <dig> to 39% of the human proteome was dedicated to be membrane proteins, clearly illustrating how difficult it is to estimate the number with automatic approaches. the membrane proteomes of e. coli and saccharomyces cerevisiae have previously been described in a fairly comprehensive manner  <cit> . recent overviews of membrane bound proteins discuss important membrane protein groups such as the g-protein coupled receptors , aquaporins, ion channels, atpases, their structure and topology  <cit> . while several individual protein and gene families have been relatively well described, for example, the gpcrs  <cit>  and voltage-gated ion channels  <cit> , there is a considerable number of genes that have remained unexplored.

we report the first detailed roadmap of the gene repertoire of human membrane bound proteins. we used  <dig>  protein sequences from the international protein index  dataset, representing the total human proteome, to create an informative classification for the majority of the non-redundant transmembrane  proteins. ipi is a top level domain, aiming to provide a union of the primary resources for proteins, as such it can be considered to contain all known protein sequences to current knowledge  <cit> . the analysis was performed in a two-step classification procedure, involving automatic prediction and classification in silico, combined with manual curation for each of the protein groups, virtually sequence for sequence applying systematic comparisons with a range of databases and other resources. we find that a large proportion of the membrane proteins can be assigned a function either as receptors, transporters, or enzymes and that a majority of all membrane proteins can be assigned to a family of evolutionary related proteins while 41% of the membrane proteins are found as single genes without close relatives. furthermore, we describe and classify new protein groups and novel members of existing families, such as the putative solute carrier family amac and a novel putative calcium-channel gamma subunit.

RESULTS
we created a dataset of  <dig>  human membrane proteins based on consensus predictions of α-helices with three applications, phobius  <cit> , tmhmm  <cit> , and sosui  <cit> , in all  <dig>  sequences in the human proteome dataset provided by ipi . the predictions of the individual applications and the consensus approach are shown in figure  <dig>  the dataset was reduced to a non-redundant set of  <dig>  protein sequences by aligning all predicted membrane proteins to the human genome with blat  <cit>  and removing all but the longest representative protein for each genomic location. the non-redundant dataset was categorized into groups using an automatic approach where all protein sequences were compared with each other and clustered according to similarity with our own implementation of the isodata algorithm combined with manual curation where data from literature and public databases were considered. this extended the final membrane protein dataset to cover  <dig>  proteins, with  <dig>  proteins of the final membrane dataset being categorized into one of  <dig> protein families or groups and assigned a functional class . to determine the quality of our classification we used the sequence comparisons from the clustering to find the median identity for the best hit among the classified and the unclassified proteins, respectively. the classified proteins have a significant median identity greater than 35%  and the unclassified have a median identity less than 13%  using a non-parametric wilcoxon signed rank test.

recently, clamp and colleagues provided a new updated set of the human gene catalog  <cit> . this dataset contains a total of  <dig>  genes from the ensembl catalog of which  <dig>  are classified as valid protein-coding. we used this dataset to classify our membrane proteins as true protein coding or non-coding. our analysis shows that  <dig> proteins of our membrane protein dataset were not present in clamp's dataset. they are considered to be invalid protein coding genes together with the  <dig> proteins which represent confirmed invalid genes. when the invalid proteins are excluded,  <dig>  proteins remain of our membrane protein dataset. this exclusion confirms the strength and quality of our classification as  <dig> , or 81%, of the invalid genes constitute 33% of the unclassified proteins. thus, when making this more stringent estimation of protein numbers, we have classified  <dig>   of the valid membrane proteins.

receptors
a receptor is a protein that mediates a cellular response upon binding of a ligand. we identified  <dig>  proteins as receptors and divided them into  <dig> groups . most of these families can be placed in one of four superfamilies; g protein-coupled receptors , receptor type tyrosine kinases , receptors of the immunoglobulin superfamily and related  and scavenger receptors and related . the remaining  <dig> receptors, in  <dig> groups, are annotated as other receptors.

transporters
transporters perform the movement of a substrate across membranes by utilizing electrochemical gradients or energy from chemical reactions. we identified  <dig> transporters and placed them in  <dig> groups . the groups have been primarily arranged into three major functional classes: channels , solute carriers , and active transporters . the remaining eight groups are annotated as other transporters . here we also include  <dig> auxiliary transport proteins in  <dig> groups that modulate the activity of other transporters rather than performing the transport themselves.

enzymes
enzymes are proteins with the ability to catalyze a chemical reaction. we have identified  <dig> enzymes . they have been classified based on the ec system, which classifies enzymes performing a similar type of reaction into six major classes: oxidoreductases , transferases , hydrolases , lyases , isomerases  and ligases . an additional six enzymes belong to multiple classes.

miscellaneous
the  <dig> protein families that did not fit into any of the  <dig> major functional classes were gathered in a class called miscellaneous. this class contains  <dig> proteins and is further divided into four subclasses: ligands , other , structural/adhesion proteins  and proteins of unknown function .

membrane topology
we created an overview of the occurrence of structures with a certain membrane topology, that is, the number of tm α-helices and the localization of the n-terminal, in the different functional classes based on predictions with phobius . this clearly shows that  <dig> tm proteins are the most numerous structures and that the number generally decreases with increasing numbers of tm helices. however, the  <dig> tm structure is an outlier, having the second highest count. it is also possible to see a trend where some topologies are more common for certain classes. receptors have in general a  <dig> tm or  <dig> tm topology representing 29% and 52% of all receptors respectively, whereas 71% of the transporters have more than  <dig> tm. it is also evident that the fraction of unclassified proteins is greater for low numbers of tm helices.  <dig> tm and  <dig> tm topologies contribute to 77% of the unclassified proteins.

availability and further analysis
the classification together with predictions by phobius, sosui, and tmhmm for each protein is available in additional file  <dig>  sequences in fasta format for each class and a blast database for the whole dataset can be found in additional file  <dig>  to help readers in making their own analysis of the dataset a short user guide is provided as additional file  <dig>  for additional data or support with extended searches and analysis of the dataset and classification, feel free to contact the corresponding author.

discussion
we provide a non-redundant dataset for the human membrane proteome and a qualitative functional classification for all major groups and families containing  <dig>  proteins. comparison with the most recent and reliable set of the genes in the human genome  <cit>  suggests that the  <dig>  validated protein coding α-helical transmembrane proteins comprise 27% of the entire human proteome. the relative number of membrane proteins coded in the human genome was estimated to be 20% after the finishing of the human genome sequence  <cit> . the overall portion of membrane bound proteins has thus increased with  <dig> percentage points, whereas the estimated number of genes has decreased significantly from  <dig>   <cit>  to  <dig>   <cit> . this may suggest that the identity of membrane proteins in general has been more reliable than soluble proteins, which may reflect that they receive relatively large attention in medical research because of their role as drug targets. our number of 27% is within the two previously suggested spans of  <dig> to 39%  <cit>  membrane proteins in the human proteome and  <dig> to 30%  <cit>  in any proteome, regardless of species. it is notable that our clustering and classification resulted in  <dig>   valid proteins of the total dataset being identified to belong to  <dig> families or groups with at least two members, while 41% of the data set are single genes with no clear identity ) to any other human membrane protein coding gene. we are not aware of any exact estimate of the relative percentage of genes belonging to protein families within the human genome but one previous estimation has suggested that at least 40% of the human genes are members of gene families  <cit> .

comparison of membrane proteome composition
the largest functional group of membrane proteins is the receptor class, constituting 23% of our membrane proteome dataset and 40% of the classified proteins. this is in large contrast with the membrane proteome of e. coli where receptors count for only 5% of the membrane proteome, leaving transporters as the most prominent group with 40%, compared with 15% in humans and 32% in s. cerevisiae's membrane proteomes  <cit> . the estimated number of membrane receptor proteins has increased from about  <dig> in e. coli to over  <dig>  in humans. the gpcrs  count for the largest expansion, with 67% of the human receptors compared with zero in bacteria and three proteins in s. cerevisiae  <cit> . the major expansion of the receptors within the metazoan lineage may reflect the need for a diverse repertoire of signaling systems for communication between cells in more complex, multicellular organisms  <cit> .

membrane topology and protein function
common for all membrane proteins in this study are that their amino acids form membrane crossing hydrophobic α-helices and their function depends on the number of helices and the orientation of the n- and c-terminal. our results show a clear bias in favor of certain topologies within the membrane proteome. we find that the majority of the proteins with odd numbers of tm helices have their n-terminal positioned on the outside of the membrane, whereas the opposite is true for those with an even number . hence, it is more common for proteins to have their c-terminal oriented to the inside of the membrane. we find that this is true for 75% of the tm proteins predicted by phobius. previously it has been reported that 82% of the tm proteomes of s. cerevisiae have the c-terminal located on the cells' inner side  <cit> . it is common that the c-terminal part of membrane proteins interacts with other intracellular proteins, for example, g-proteins and many accessory proteins bind to the c-terminal of gpcrs and this is essential for signaling  <cit> . many proteins have only one single tm helix  and while some of these tm regions seem to have a primary role to simply anchor the protein to the membrane, that is, no signal or substrate is relying on the tm helices to cross the membrane, several form oligomers that can participate in the signal process. non-gpcr receptors are common  <dig> tm proteins  and 60% of the proteins in the enzyme group are also found here, but only  <dig> transporters. on the other hand, multi-tm proteins are often highly dependent of the arrangement of their tm helices that form complex structures. transporters are the most obvious group, which in general has high tm numbers; 77% of the transporters have at least a  <dig> tm topology and 76% of the classified proteins with at least  <dig> tm helices are transporters. this is also true for a majority of the families classified as transporters . in the tcdb database, which holds transporter families from all organisms, 70% of  <dig>  α-helical channels, secondary transporters and active transporters, have at least a  <dig> tm topology according to predictions by phobius. further,  <dig> tm was the most common topology in tcdb , which is in analogy with 16% in human . thus, a high number of tm helices is a good predictor for transporter function and the topologies of the human transporter are representative for transporters in general, considering a number of distant species. there are also receptors with a high number of tm helices. the  <dig> tm structure of the large gpcr group, which contains 67% of the human receptors, undergoes a conformation change upon ligand binding, which propagates the signal into the cell. other topologies among the receptors other than  <dig> tm and  <dig> tm are only found in seven of the  <dig> classified receptor groups, a total of  <dig> proteins. one of these are the two hedgehog receptors, patched, with a  <dig> tm topology which otherwise is almost exclusively found among transporters. in the  <dig> groups of the miscellaneous class, some interesting observations regarding membrane topology are made . in the group of structure/adhesion proteins, with  <dig> members, all  <dig> families show either a  <dig> tm or  <dig> tm topology. most numerous are the nine families of  <dig> tm proteins, 73% of the group, which among others contains the large cadherin and protocadherin families of  <dig> and  <dig> proteins, respectively. these proteins generally form homologous connections between cells, that is, two identical proteins from the cells adhere to each other  <cit> . they are important during development and for keeping tissue integrity and morphology, since cells expressing the same proteins stick together. in addition, there are also some minor  <dig> tm families, for example, sarcoglycan, that are found in structures that anchor the muscle fibers to the extracellular matrix  <cit> . the remaining 27% of this group are  <dig> tm proteins of structure/adhesion character that can be divided into three families; gap junctions , claudins, and five proteins of the emp/pmp22/lim family.

the members of the two latter families belong to the same pfam domain  and are likely to share common descent. in the pfam database we find that 58% of the  <dig>  non-human proteins containing any of the pfam families found in the structure/adhesion class, except immunoglobulins, are predicted to possess only one tm while 20% are predicted to have a  <dig> tm topology. this suggests that the relative frequency of  <dig> tm and  <dig> tm structure/adhesion proteins is similar in humans and other organisms. proteins with a  <dig> tm structure are also found in the 'other' and 'protein of unknown function' groups, constituting 25% and 16% of the respective groups. hence, the  <dig> tm proteins are over-represented in the miscellaneous class, but they are also found to a rather high extent among transporters, especially in the families of ion channels. it should be noted that the  <dig> tm proteins of transporters and the miscellaneous class generally are predicted to have opposite topology: the transporters have their n-termini located on the outside of the membrane whereas the miscellaneous proteins have it on the inside. the  <dig> tm topology proteins which are found in the miscellaneous class are not classical receptors or enzymes, but rather involved in the formation of structures , vesicle trafficking  or organizing other proteins of the membrane   <cit> . therefore they could have been ignored in pharmacological research efforts, which explain why many of the  <dig> tm proteins are found in this group. in general, it seems that  <dig> tm topology proteins are relatively under-studied. overall it is evident that a larger portion of the short proteins with fewer than seven helices, and especially  <dig> tm proteins, are uncharacterized. such bias has been shown for other organisms in previous studies  <cit> .

identification of uncharacterized proteins and families
our clustering resulted in the identification of new protein groups and novel members of existing families. discussions about individual members in existing families are found in additional file  <dig>  here we want to highlight five clusters with a total of  <dig> sequences found in the miscellaneous class where no previous relationship within the families have been reported. these families are simply termed new tm group : ntm1g <dig>  ntm1g <dig>  ntmg <dig>  ntmg <dig>  and ntm5g1; they are more or less uncharacterized with little annotation and no similarity to any pfam domain. the ntm5g <dig> family contains three proteins; two are found in a cluster at chromosome  <dig> and one at chromosome  <dig>  two are predicted to be  <dig> tm proteins and one  <dig> tm. they show high identity to the c-terminal end of the  <dig> tm protein unc93b <dig>  this protein is found in chromosome  <dig>  implicating an expansion of the family through a gene duplication event. recently unc93b <dig> was reported to be involved in trafficking of toll receptors to endolysosomes and is proposed to be involved in immunodeficiency, but when its homolog was initially characterized in c. elegans it was found to be involved in muscle contraction, which suggests multiple functions for the putative family  <cit> . the three novel proteins have orthologs in several species, which supports them as valid proteins and they might represent a novel subfamily of truncated unc93b <dig> homologues . such truncated genes were discussed by kashuba and colleagues as they found clones with high similarity to the 3' part of the unc93b <dig> gene  <cit> . none of the other ntmg families has any similarities with known proteins and can thus be considered as virtually uncharacterized. considering the extent of our clustering methods we find it unlikely that larger groups of closely related proteins are left to be discovered within the human tm proteome, although it cannot be entirely excluded. however, there are probably still several distant members of existing families and diverse novel families that could be identified in the future using more sensitive techniques than sequence comparisons.

CONCLUSIONS
we annotated the majority of the human membrane bound proteome linked with functional properties and family or group affiliation. this classification represents most major families and groups found in the membrane proteome and provides the most detailed and updated count of their members. overall, our clustering and functional classification approach is likely to be useful in order to create a detailed map of the entire human genome.
