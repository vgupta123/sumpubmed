BACKGROUND
the development of stem cells and progenitor cells into mature functioning cells depends on, among others, the correct functioning of the wnt signaling pathway  <cit> . as an example, wnt3a deficiency leads in leukemia cells to reduced numbers of long-term hematopoietic stem cells  and multipotent progenitors  <cit> . in acute myeloid leukemia , the wnt pathway genes do not show frequent genetic alterations but rather gene silencing by promoter methylation  <cit> . the epigenetic alterations plays a critical role in initiation, progression, and maintenance of the disease phenotype. promoter methylation of genes in the wnt pathway  causes genes to be downregulated in their mrna expression, thereby deregulation of the wnt signaling. the relation between these genetic and epigenetic factors is especially important when studying the disease phenotype, such as for patients with deregulated wnt signaling. this is also shown in previous studies that reported associations of promoter methylation of wnt signaling genes with adverse prognosis  <cit> .

over the past years, genetic and epigenetic studies have, independently from each other, provided important new insights in the underlying pathology of acute myeloid leukemia   <cit> . aml is a heterogeneous disease that can roughly be classified in three risk groups; good, intermediate and the poor risk group. the good risk group consists of patients with a translocation between chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> ) or a translocation between chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  or an inversion of chromosome  <dig> ). the intermediate risk group consists patients with a normal karyotype, and the poor risk group with a complex karyotype . previous studies analysed genetic and epigenetic changes of wnt signaling genes mostly in patients with intermediate risk  <cit> , however, dna hypermethylation was found to be enriched for the good risk group  <cit> . these studies however analysed a limited number of genes in the wnt signaling pathway. a comprehensive analysis of the relationships between dna-methylation and transcript expression by means of all annotated genes of the wnt signaling pathway has not been done.

for this study we developed a statistical approach to model the mrna transcript expression with dna-methylation abundance and applied it to a complete list of wnt signaling genes. this allowed us to refine groups of patients from which genes have specific promoter methylation , and gene expression , potentially important for better clinical diagnostics. further we provided novel insights of wnt signaling in aml that may inspire therapeutic interventions. our integration strategy provides useful biological interpretation for the detected prognostic markers and for patient clustering.

RESULTS
analysis of prognostic markers by means of gene-state scenarios
it has previously been shown that dna-methylation or gene expression levels of genes can be used as predictive features to determine clinical outcome of aml patients  <cit> . we speculated that patient groups can be refined when dna-methylation and gene expression levels of genes are analysed in an integrated fashion. we therefore categorized each gene in one of nine scenarios, each representing a unique combination of up/down/no gene expression and hyper/hypo/no methylation of its promoter region . we next assessed whether a state of a gene is predictive for clinical outcome for overall survival  and event-free survival  using univariate  and multivariate analyses  . we used in total  <dig> aml patients and marked a gene as a prognostic marker if both the univariate and multivariate analysis resulted in significant differences in clinical outcome with p ≤  <dig>  .

re-analysis of known wnt associated prognostic markers for leukemia
we started analysing thirteen wnt signaling genes that are known to have important function in leukemia, i.e., sfrp <dig>  sfrp <dig>  sfrp <dig>  dkk <dig>  dkk <dig>  apc, apc <dig>  runx <dig>  wif <dig>  tcf <dig>  lef <dig>  lkb1/stk <dig>  and ctnnb <dig>  and could confirm on our data that lef <dig>  <cit> , sfrp <dig>  <cit> , runx <dig>  <cit> , and axin <dig> have prognostic value.

axin2
axin inhibition protein  <dig>  is a well-established readout for wnt signaling activation across various species and has been used within the hematopoietic system in reporter mice as readout of wnt activation <cit> . we detected that the expression levels of axin <dig> separates patients in two groups for which unfavourable outcome is seen for patients with significant downregulated axin <dig> expression levels in os  and efs . note that this is irrespective of the dna-methylation levels in the promoter region of axin <dig> . surprisingly, this is in contrast to solid tumours, for instance colon carcinomas, in which high wnt signaling is a risk factor.

cox proportional hazard model for multivariable analyses of prognostic markers for overall survival. analyses included  <dig> aml patients. abbreviations: hr, hazard ratio; ci, confidence interval; α cebpadouble−mutation status versus cebpawt, β flt3itd versus no flt3itd mutation, β npm1mutant versus npm1wt, δ wbc count higher than  <dig> × 109/l versus lower than  <dig> × 109/l, $ age is used as continuous variable.

lef1
for lymphoid enhancer-binding factor- <dig>  it was shown that high gene expression levels are associated with favourable clinical outcome in cn-aml  <cit> , and thus that downregulated expression levels are then associated with unfavourable clinical outcome. we indeed detected in our data that patients with significant downregulated lef <dig> mrna expression levels have an unfavourable clinical outcome for os , and efs . in addition, the unfavourable clinical outcome was only seen for patients that showed no significant differences of promoter dna-methylation of lef <dig> . in fact, from the  <dig> patients with significant downregulated gene expression levels of lef <dig>  only  <dig> patients with lef <dig> in scenario  <dig> could be marked with significant unfavourable clinical outcome whereas the other  <dig> patients  could not.

sfrp2
for the secreted frizzled-related protein  <dig>  it has previously been shown that dna hypermethylation of the promoter region is associated with unfavourable clinical outcome  <cit> . in our data, we also detected significant unfavourable clinical outcome for patients with promoter hypermethylated sfrp <dig>  but these patients also showed downregulated expression levels of sfrp <dig> . in addition to that, unfavourable clinical outcome was also seen for patients with solely downregulated expression levels of sfrp <dig> . these two patients groups were therefore combined in our approach, as described in the method section .

runx1
runt-related transcription factor is a tumor suppressor in myeloid neoplasms, and mutations in runx <dig> are previously associated with unfavourable outcome in cn-amls  <cit> . in addition, it was previously demonstrated that inhibition of runx <dig> activity could be a promising therapeutic strategy for amls with leukemogenic fusion proteins  <cit> .we detected significant unfavourable clinical outcome in os , but not for efs , for patients with dna hypermethylation but without significant differences of gene expression levels of runx <dig> . thus we show that not all patients with dna hypermethylation have poor survival; it also depends on the gene expression levels.

taken together, by re-analysing known wnt associated markers, we could re-establish the prognostic role of a number of these markers in aml patients, but we also illustrate that patient groups could be refined by using an integrative analysis of gene expression and dna-methylation profiles. a comparison of our results with the use of only gene expression profiles, we detected that only sfrp <dig> showed significant associations with os and efs, i.e., downregulated expression levels  are associated with unfavourable clinical outcome compared to the upregulated expression levels . the use of solely dna-methylation profiles did not result in significant associations with clinical outcome, i.e., hypermethylation  versus hypomethylation .

detection of novel wnt associated prognostic markers for leukemia
in addition to the wnt signaling genes that are known to have important functions in leukemia, we also analysed the  <dig> wnt signaling genes annotated in the molecular signature database . we speculated that novel prognostic markers could be identified by using the refined gene-state scenarios. three additional genes  showed significant differences in os and efs.

psmd2
the proteasome non-catalytic subunit is previously identified as a potential therapeutic target in lung adenocarcinomas  <cit> . for psmd <dig> we detected significant favourable os  and efs , for patients with a promoter hypomethylation and downregulated gene expression levels . in addition, favourable clinical outcome was also seen for patients with solely promoter hypomethylation . these two patients groups were therefore combined in our approach.

xpnpep2
patients were detected with significant unfavourable clinical outcome for os  and efs  if the promoter of gene x-prolyl amino peptidase  <dig> was dna hypermethylation and the expression was upregulated .

ppard
the third independent prognostic marker that we detected is peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta . we detected significant favourable clinical outcome for os  and efs , among patients with hypomethylated levels and without significant change of gene expression levels . in addition, favourable clinical outcome was also seen for patients with promoter hypomethylation and upregulated gene expression levels . these two patients groups could therefore be combined.

taken together, by analysing methylation and expression data together we could associate three more wnt signaling genes with prognostic relevance, enforcing the role of wnt signaling in leukemia. a comparison of the integrative results with the use of only gene expression profiles revealed that only xpnpep <dig> was significantly association with os and efs in univariate and multivariate analysis, i.e., upregulated expression levels  are associated with unfavourable clinical outcome compared to the upregulated expression levels . on the other hand, the use of solely dna-methylation profiles showed significant associations with clinical outcome for psmd <dig> , and ppard  by a comparison of hypermethylation  versus hypomethylation . for both cases, promoter hypermethylation is associated with unfavourable outcome.

hierarchical clustering of aml patients based on gene-state scenarios revealed grouping of patients that are associated with clinical outcome
it has been shown previously that patients with two or more hypermethylated wnt genes are associated with unfavourable survival compared to patients with zero or one hypermethylated wnt genes  <cit> . we therefore asked ourselves whether we can improve the subtyping of patients based on the patterns of multiple wnt signaling genes. we hierarchically clustered the patients, using the  <dig> wnt signaling genes that are previously associated with leukemia, with a hamming distance over the gene-state description and complete linkage . eight clusters are detected in total from which four clusters showed enrichment with known cytogenetic or molecular abnormalities, and three patient clusters showed enrichment with dna hypermethylation. we focussed only on cluster  <dig> and  <dig> as these showed significant differences in clinical outcome for both os and efs compared to the patients in any of the other clusters.

cluster 1
cluster  <dig> is one of the three clusters  that showed significant overrepresentation of genes with dna hypermethylation. however, only cluster  <dig> resulted in significant unfavourable clinical outcome for os and efs . the two other clusters are enriched for the good cytogenetical risk group , and for mds patients . dna hypermethylation of wnt signaling genes among the good cytogenetical risk group  <cit> , and mds/secondary amls  <cit>  are supported by previous results. in fact, it has also been illustrated that patients with multiple hypermethylated wnt signaling genes are associated with unfavourable clinical outcome  <cit> . but we demonstrate that significant unfavourable clinical outcome is only seen for patients with overrepresentation of genes in scenario  <dig> . patients in this cluster  also showed significant occurrence of asxl <dig> mutations, which has previously been described to be a prognostic marker for unfavourable outcome  <cit> . to determine whether the dna hypermethylation  causes the unfavourable outcome of cluster  <dig> patients or whether it is caused by the asxl <dig> mutations, we included asxl <dig> as an additional covariate in the multivariate analysis. with a result that cluster  <dig> still showed significant survival for os  and efs , and thereby indicating that patients with dna hypermethylation of wnt genes are associated with unfavourable survival.

cluster 5
patients in cluster  <dig> also showed unfavourable os and efs . these patients were enriched for genes with their state in scenario  <dig> but showed no enrichment for other cytogenetical or molecular abnormalities.

with the cluster analysis we illustrate the complex behaviour of multiple wnt signaling genes and their combined association with clinical outcome. using both the methylation and expression profiling we are able to refine current subtyping of aml patient's giving new leads to further research.

the good risk patients group is characterized by dna hypermethylation of the wnt pathway
we analysed the gene expression and dna-methylation profiles of the  <dig> wnt signaling genes to infer whether wnt signaling genes could explain differences among the risk groups. we detected that dna hypermethylation  is significantly more seen in the wnt genes among the good risk group patients when compared to the intermediate and poor risk group . by looking into the gene-states of the wnt genes, we found that 33% of the wnt genes are in similar gene-states for all the three risk groups, whereas only  <dig> genes  showed unique gene-states for the risk groups . among them 'proteasome 26s subunit, non-atpase, 10' . for psmd <dig> there is evidence that positive expression levels associate with short survival time of patients in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma tissues  <cit> . this is in line with our results where the poor risk group is detected with overexpression, and the good and intermediate risk group with promoter dna hypermethylation of psmd <dig> 

good risk patients group shows interactions between wnt signaling genes and genes of the proteasome network
to gain more insights in the role of dna-methylation for the signaling cascade of wnt we examined whether the methylation status associates with the functional importance of a gene. to get a notion of the functional importance of a gene, we assumed that the degree of a gene, in a co-expression network is indicative for its role: i.e., a gene with frequent interactions potentially regulates  more genes. consequently, we construct a co-expression network by means of pairwise pearson correlations between the continuous mrna expression levels for the poor, intermediate and good aml risk group .

the good risk group contained in total  <dig> significantly expressed genes for which  <dig> are upregulated and  <dig> downregulated. pairwise correlation resulted in  <dig> unique genes with one or more significant pairwise interactions . dna hypermethylation was detected in 36% of the genes, whereas the genes with highest degree consists of dna hypermethylated genes, such as kremen <dig>  apc <dig>  cstf <dig>  nfatc <dig>  spag <dig>  wif <dig> .

the intermediate risk group contains  <dig> significantly regulated genes , for which  <dig> unique genes had significant pairwise interactions. nine genes are detected with dna hypermethylation from which kremen <dig>  and spag <dig> are listed with the highest degree . the poor risk group contains  <dig> significantly upregulated and  <dig> downregulated genes for which  <dig> unique genes had significant pairwise interactions. the genes with the highest degree contained, among others, the dna hypermethylated gene spag <dig> .

interestingly, genes with a high degree appear to be dna hypermethylation, such as for gene kremen <dig>  which is seen in similar state in the good and intermediate risk group but not in the poor risk group. kremen <dig> encodes a high-affinity dickkopf homolog  <dig>  transmembrane receptor that functionally cooperates with dkk <dig> to block wingless /beta-catenin signaling. another finding is that each risk group contains two similar sub-networks , indicating that genes behave, to some extent similar. the first network consists of genes such as kremen <dig>  spag <dig>  dkk <dig>  and nfatc <dig> that appeared to be under control of dna hypermethylation in the good risk group, but not for the intermediate and poor risk group. the second network is significantly enriched for proteasome gene family members  which provides instructions for making parts of the proteasomes, and are part of the cell's quality control system. remarkably, the good risk group has frequent co-regulatory effects with the proteasome network whereas this seems absent in the intermediate and poor risk group. to summarize, we show that dna hypermethylated genes appear to be highly connected in the co-expression network, and interact with a proteasome network for the good risk group, which is not the case for the intermediate and poor risk group.

CONCLUSIONS
we created a computational approach to classify genes into scenarios that describe, in a discrete manner, the state of a gene considering its gene expression and the dna-methylation levels of its promoter region. throughout the whole study we used these scenarios to analyse wnt signaling genes for patients with acute myeloid leukemia. as in previous studies  <cit> , we also detected high frequency of dna hypermethylation of wnt genes in aml but could now better characterize patients by jointly analysing the dna-methylation and gene expression profiles.

we illustrate that the integration of dna-methylation and gene expression into scenarios can refine and detect novel prognostic gene markers. this is especially important when groups are selected using prognostic markers for targeted drug therapy. using our integrative approach we detected in total seven independent prognostic markers from which two  overlapped if only gene expression profiles are used . based on only dna-methylation profiles,  <dig> prognostic markers are detected from which two  overlapped with our integrative approach .

our approach also refined patient groups for which previously was shown that multiple hypermethylated wnt genes were associated with unfavourable survival  <cit> . we demonstrate that unfavourable survival of patients is associated with promoter hypermethylation without change of gene expression levels . in addition, we detected that good risk group patients significantly harbour dna hypermethylation  in aml cell lines  <cit> .

although many studies illustrate that gene expression or dna-methylation levels in isolation can serve as a prognostic marker, our computational approach proved effective in the identification of prognostic markers and improves characterization of patient groups by the integration of gene expression and dna-methylation profiles. this is especially important when groups are selected on prognostic markers for targeted drug therapy.
