BACKGROUND
xylan, the major component in plant cells and the most abundant hemicellulose, is composed of β- <dig> -linked xylopyranosyl residues  <cit> . recently, lignocellulose, the most plentiful renewable biomass produced from photosynthesis, has attracted worldwide attention as a raw material for bioconversion  <cit> . degrading all components of lignocellulose requires the synergistic activity of a large variety of enzymes with different specificities, such as exo- <dig> -β-glucanases, endo- <dig> -β-glucanases, β-glucosidases, endo-xylanases, pectin methyl esterases, and laccase  <cit> .

among these, xylanases  are the core enzymes responsible for the degradation of xylan into monomers through the random cleavage of β- <dig> -glycosidic bonds in the xylan backbone  <cit> . xylanases have widespread potential applications in the textile, feed, beverage, and biofuel industries  <cit> ; moreover, they form a major group of industrial enzymes used in the paper and pulp industry. the release of lignin from paper pulp can be facilitated by the hydrolysis of xylan  <cit> . xylanases can facilitate the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic substrates as xylanases ameliorate the “blocking effect” of xylan, one of the major mechanisms that limits the accessibility of cellulose to cellulase enzymes. xylanases also interact synergistically with cellulases to improve cellulose accessibility by increasing fiber swelling and porosity  <cit> .

according to amino acid sequences, structural folds, and catalytic mechanisms, xylanases are classified into glycoside hydrolases  families  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  <cit> . an industrially suitable xylanase should have certain specific properties; for example, high activity and stability at high temperatures  or at high ph   <cit> . thermobifida fusca is a thermophilic actinomycete and a major degrader of plant cell walls in heated organic materials such as compost piles and rotting hay  <cit> . the xylanase xyn11a, from t. fusca, belongs to the g  family and contains a substrate-binding domain. xyn11a has thermostable properties, unique among family g xylanases, that are especially useful for industrial purposes  <cit> .

the yeast pichia pastoris is an excellent and efficient system for the expression of secreted and intracellular proteins  <cit> . a number of xylanases from a variety of organisms have been cloned and expressed in p. pastoris  <cit> . some xylanases have been cloned and expressed in the bacterium escherichia coli  <cit> . a comparison of expression levels and the activities of products in p. pastoris and e. coli revealed that expression levels of active proteins in p. pastoris were much higher than those in e. coli  <cit> . recombinant proteins produced in p. pastoris were very easily n-glycosylated via post-translational modification, although the properties of glycosylated proteins were not always distinct from unglycosylated proteins. the thermostability of recombinant proteins can be decreased or increased after glycosylation  <cit> .

we selected the xyna gene encoding xyn11a from t. fusca yx for cloning and expression in p. pastoris. to facilitate the purification of recombinant proteins, some of the proteins were fused to a polyhistidine tag  at the c-terminus  <cit> ; however, recombinant proteins containing a his-tag can differ from their wild-type counterparts with respect to dimerization or oligomerization properties  <cit> . we therefore also attempted to express xyna in its native form in a p. pastoris expression system and compared the properties of the native form with those of the his-tagged form.

RESULTS
analysis of xyna gene from t. fusca genomic dna
we amplified an 891-bp dna fragment encoding the mature xyn11a peptide  by polymerase chain reaction  from the genomic dna of t. fusca yx using primers . the fragment was then successfully cloned into the pmd19-t vector . according to the xyn11a protein sequence , the mature xyn11a peptide comprises a 189-aa catalytic domain , an 86-aa xylan binding domain , and a 21-aa gly-pro-rich region that connects the cd and xbd  <cit> . the nucleotide and corresponding aa sequences of xyn11a are shown in figure  <dig>  based on previous studies, there were seven possible n-glycosylation sites   <cit> , with very little o-linked glycosylation observed in p. pastoris  <cit> . supposing that all of the possible n-glycosylations occurred and the average glycosylated side chain was man10glcnac  <cit> , then the molecular mass of the target protein would increase by about  <dig>  kda compared with the native wild-type xyn11a .figure  <dig>

expression of recombinant xyn11a and xyn11a- <dig> in p. pastoris
the ppiczα-xyna and ppiczα-xyna- <dig> expression plasmids were successfully generated as described in methods. the coding sequences for xyn11a and xyn11a- <dig> were cloned in frame with the α-factor signal sequence in the p. pastoris-e. coli shuttle vector ppiczα-a. after confirmation by sequencing, the recombinant plasmids were linearized using restriction endonuclease pmei and electroporated into p. pastoris x- <dig>  the ppiczα-a vector was used as a negative control and transformed into p. pastoris x- <dig>  transformants harboring ppiczα-xyna or ppiczα-xyna- <dig> were grown on ypds agar plates containing 100 μg/ml zeocin and selected for high resistance to zeocin ; successful transformants were obtained.

the ppiczα-xyna or ppiczα-xyna- <dig> plasmids carrying the xyna gene were regulated by an alcohol oxidase gene promoter that could be induced by  <dig> %  methanol. the maximum activities of recombinant xyn11a  and recombinant xyn11a- <dig> 6) in bmmy medium reached  <dig>  and  <dig>  u/ml, respectively, after 96 h of cultivation. the specific activity of a crude preparation of rxyn11a  was about 12% higher than that of rxyn11a- <dig> . the c-terminal his tag was located behind the xbd which was not essential for efficient hydrolysis of soluble xylan <cit> , therefore the c-terminal his tag affected the activity of rxyn11a- <dig> through its dimerization or oligomerization properties  <cit> .

several protein bands corresponding to a molecular mass of about 45 kda were observed as the major protein in supernatants from p. pastoris/ppiczα-xyna and p. pastoris/ppiczα-xyna- <dig> cultures. this protein was not detected in the supernatant of p. pastoris cultures transformed with ppiczα-a . these 45-kda proteins accumulated in supernatants obtained at different culture times . the molecular mass of native wild-type xyn11a should be  <dig>  kda  <cit> ; however, activity assays revealed that these 45-kda proteins possessed xylanase activity , and thus we assign them as the recombinant xylanases with some glycosylated side chains. xylanase activity was not detected in the supernatant of p. pastoris transformed with ppiczα-a. these results were consistent with those from previous studies, indicating the generation of several glycosylated proteins  <cit> . a separate protein band  was thought to be the proteolytic degradation product of recombinant xylanase including the cd. the target proteins rxyn11a and rxyn11a- <dig> constituted up to  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively, of all soluble proteins in supernatants as determined by bandscan  <dig>  software .figure  <dig>

purification of recombinant xylanases
purification of the recombinant proteins was performed as described in methods, and a summary is presented in table  <dig>  the rxyn11a and rxyn11a- <dig> were purified  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold to homogeneity with recovery yields of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. the purification fold was not high because the recombinant xylanases constituted so much of the total protein in the supernatants . the specific activity of rxyn11a was  <dig>  u/mg while that of rxyn11a- <dig> was  <dig>  u/mg. purified fractions of rxyn11a and rxyn11a- <dig> were subjected to 15% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  and revealed several protein bands with molecular masses of about 45 kda, which were distinct from the molecular mass of wild-type xyn11a  and the calculated molecular mass of rxyn11a- <dig> , respectively .table  <dig>

although rxyn11a- <dig> could be purified to homogeneity with a simpler procedure than rxyn11a, the latter exhibited higher specific activity than the former, consistent with results from a previous study where it was shown that the recombinant native form of cellulase was more active and stable than a c-terminal his-tagged cellulase produced in e. coli  <cit> .

characterization of the recombinant xylanases
both rxyn11a and rxyn11a- <dig> were optimally active at ph  <dig> , and exhibited >60% activity between ph  <dig> – <dig>  . optimal activity was seen at 80°c, with >60% activity between  <dig> and 80°c . activities increased as the temperature rose, resulting in maximum activity at 80°c, and then decreased rapidly when the temperature increased above 80°c. the residual activities of both recombinant xylanases were >60% over a broad ph range , indicating their stability and that they would be of great practical use in various industrial applications . the rxyn11a xylanase exhibited >80% residual activity between  <dig> and 80°c, while rxyn11a- <dig> exhibited 57% residual activity at 80°c . after incubation at 90°c for 30 min, rxyn11a and rxyn11a- <dig> retained more than 10% of their initial activities . we observed >20% residual activity for rxyn11a and rxyn11a- <dig> after treatment at 90°c for 10 min . both of the recombinant xylanases showed better thermal stabilities than the native wild-type xyn11a from t. fusca  <cit> . compared with results in a previous study regarding the same xylanase that was not glycosylated in p. pastoris  <cit> , rxyn11a and rxyn11a- <dig> exhibited greater thermostability, possibly because of glycosylation of the recombinant xylanases.figure  <dig>

analysis of deglycosylation
analysis of rxyn11a and rxyn11a- <dig> by sds-page revealed that their molecular weights  were increased by about 13 kda compared with the native wild-type xyn11a . following treatment with endo-h to remove carbohydrate moieties, a protein band was observed at about 32 kda by sds-page . these findings suggested that n-glycosylation of rxyn11a and rxyn11a- <dig> accounted for about 13 kda.

both the deglycosylated rxyn11a and rxyn11a- <dig> showed optimal activities at 70°c and ph  <dig>  , which were decreased compared with the n-glycosylated recombinant xylanases . the deglycosylated xylanases showed similar ph stability to the n-glycosylated recombinant xylanases , but the thermostability was decreased. after incubation at 80°c and 90°c for 30 min, deglycosylated rxyn11a and rxyn11a- <dig> retained less than 30% and 5% of their initial activities , respectively. sds-page of deglycosylated rxyn11a and rxyn11a- <dig> without denaturation showed that rxyn11a- <dig> was not thoroughly deglycosylated , thus the change in thermostability of rxyn11a- <dig> was less than that for rxyn11a. the c-terminal his tag did not have a major effect on the activity and stability of recombinant xylanase after deglycosylation .figure  <dig>

the recombinant xylanases had higher optimum temperatures and exhibited better thermostability, possibly because of n-glycosylation. our results corresponded with those in a previous study that showed that the n-glycosylation of recombinant enzymes expressed in p. pastoris enhanced their thermal stabilities  <cit> .

based on the amino acid sequence of mature xyn11a , there appear to be seven potential n-glycosylation sites ; these sites were predicted by netnglyc  <dig> server . among these n-glycosylation sites, the first four were located within the cd and the last three sites were within the xbd. there were six sites  with >54% probability of being glycosylated. a possible explanation for the higher thermostability caused by glycosylation may be that the long outer chains added during glycosylation can affect the folding or function of a foreign protein in p. pastoris  <cit> . in this study, the optimum ph was altered from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and the optimum temperature increased from 65°c to 80°c. these changes may be attributable to the four n-glycosylation sites located within the cd. to investigate the relationship between n-glycosylation and xylanase thermostability, we used swiss model to perform homology-modelling of xyn11a . there are one α-helix and several β-sheets in this domain , and the β-sheets form a groove  which houses the active site  <cit> . several potential n-glycosylation sites were just included in the catalytic domain. furthermore, it is believed that thermostable enzymes usually contain a large number of surface polar residues which generate more water-mediated networks surrounding the enzyme  <cit> . therefore, the thermostability of rxyn11a and rxyn11a- <dig> may be increased by n-glycosylation. the glycosylation of recombinant proteins alters some properties of the protein but not to a great extent  <cit> ; in certain cases glycosylation can adversely affect thermostability in p. pastoris  <cit> . in a study examining the same xylanase, it was seen that when the linearized ppic9k-tfx plasmid was transformed into p. pastoris gs <dig> after the xylanase gene was cloned into the vector, the expressed recombinant xylanase was not glycosylated and was the same size as the native xylanase  <cit> . these results showed that the difference between plasmids, as well as protein properties, may affect the glycosylation of recombinant proteins expressed in p. pastoris.figure  <dig>

analysis of hydrolytic products
the products of beechwood xylan hydrolyzed by rxyn11a and rxyn11a- <dig> were analyzed using thin-layer chromatography   and high-performance ion chromatography  . for tlc, a series of oligosaccharides with a degree of polymerization of two and above were observed on the silica gel plate. the main hydrolytic products were x2–x <dig>  while many higher oligomers were still present in the digest. during hydrolysis, the concentrations of xylooligosaccharides increased for 4 h and then decreased as the xylooligosaccharides were hydrolyzed by the recombinant xylanases . the hpic results revealed that rxyn11a is better at hydrolyzing beechwood xylan than rxyn11a- <dig>  these findings imply that the c-terminal his tag probably has adverse effects on xylanase activity. the c-terminal his tag may alter the structure of recombinant xylanases. the tlc and hpic analyses showed that the main hydrolytic products were higher oligomers than xylose. even after 24 h, there was little xylose released via hydrolysis. therefore, our results indicate that rxyn11a and rxyn11a- <dig> hydrolyzed xylan by cleaving the intramolecular glycosidic bonds of xylooligosaccharides, as they are both endoxylanases  <cit> . the distribution pattern of hydrolytic products was identical for rxyn11a and rxyn11a- <dig> figure  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
we have described the cloning and expression of a xylanase from t. fusca, and compared the characteristics of the recombinant wild-type xylanase, and the xylanase with a c-terminal his tag, expressed in p. pastoris. the characteristics of rxyn11a and rxyn11a- <dig> were similar with respect to thermostability and ph tolerance. the activity of rxyn11a was higher than that of rxyn11a- <dig>  with both their activities higher than that of native xyn11a. therefore, we conclude that the c-terminal his tag had adverse effects on enzyme activity. n-glycosylation enhanced the thermostability of the recombinant xylanases, suggesting they could be applied to the degradation of cellulosic materials and in other industries.
