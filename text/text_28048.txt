BACKGROUND
central nervous system  is the main organ affected in patients suffering from creatine  deficiency syndromes due either to agat, gamt or ct <dig> deficiency  <cit> . as recently described, these patients present neurological symptoms in early infancy and show severe neurodevelopmental delay  <cit> . all three deficiencies are characterized by an absence, or a severe decrease, of cr in cns  <cit> .

the cr / phosphocreatine  / creatine kinase  system is essential for the buffering and transport of high energy phosphates  <cit> . cr is taken up by food, or synthesized endogenously by a two-step mechanism involving l-arginine:glycine amidinotransferase  and s-adenosyl-l-methionine:n-guanidinoacetate methyltransferase . cr is taken up by cells through ct <dig>  a specific cr transporter belonging to the na+-dependent neurotransmitter transporter family. in adult mammals, agat is predominantly expressed in kidney and pancreas, and gamt is mainly localized in liver and pancreas. in addition, both enzymes are also expressed in various other tissues, albeit at lower levels. the highest expression of ct <dig> is found in kidney, heart and skeletal muscle . cr synthesis has been observed in cns  <cit> . agat and gamt mrnas have been revealed in neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes  <cit> . by contrast, ct <dig> has been found in neurons, oligodendrocytes and microcapillary endothelial cells, but is not detectable in astrocytes  <cit> . cr plays an essential role in cns, where it is involved in na+-k+-atpase activity, neurotransmitter release, maintenance of membrane potentials, ca++ homeostasis or restoration of ion gradients . we have further shown recently that cr might be involved in axonal growth  <cit> . cr poorly crosses the blood brain barrier of rodents  <cit> ; high doses of cr given over a long period of treatment only partially replenish brain cr of agat and gamt deficient patients  <cit> . it has thus been suggested that the postnatal and adult cns might depend, at least for a part of its needs, on its own cr synthesis  <cit> . this is however in contradiction with the fact that ct <dig> deficient patients, who should express agat and gamt correctly in their cns, are nevertheless depleted in intracerebral cr stores  <cit> .

little information is available on agat, gamt and ct <dig> in embryonic development. agat  and gamt  were found in whole extracts of the developing mouse embryo  <cit> . ct <dig> mrna has been shown in the e <dig> rat embryo, in the entire neuraxis as well as in non-neural tissue  <cit> . the materno-fetal transport of cr has been demonstrated  <cit> . as cr deficiencies lead to severe developmental delay, our aim was to investigate at what time and in which tissues the system for cr synthesis and transport is expressed during embryonic development. we determined therefore the tissue distribution of agat, gamt and ct <dig> gene expression in rat embryos aged of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  days, at mrna and protein level using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry respectively.

RESULTS
the developmental expression of agat, gamt and ct <dig> genes was analyzed in e <dig> , e <dig>  and e <dig>  rat embryos at the mrna and protein levels. for each embryonic stage, patterns of agat, gamt and ct <dig> expression were validated by i) the specificity of anti-agat, anti-gamt and anti-ct <dig> antibodies , ii) the specificity of in situ hybridization probes , and iii) the remarkable coherence between in situ hybridization  and immunohistochemistry  stainings . brain structures enlarged in figures  <dig> to  <dig>  are illustrated in figure  <dig> at lower magnification.

discussion
creatine in embryonic development
the cr / p-cr / ck system plays an essential role in energy homeostasis during the vertebrate embryonic development, with prominent activities in tissues such as developing cns and muscles  <cit> . ck genes are expressed very early in many structures of the vertebrate embryo  <cit> , whereas cr concentration between  <dig> and  <dig> mmol/kg wet weight are found in the whole rat fetus, depending on the developmental stage  <cit> . in cns, cr concentration between  <dig> and  <dig> mmol/kg wet weight have been found in rat and human fetus, depending on the gestational stage  <cit> . parts of the developmental needs for cr can be fulfilled by the active transport of cr from the mother to the embryo  <cit> . gamt knock-out mice, which develop biochemical alterations comparable to those found in human gamt deficient patients, present an increase in perinatal mortality  <cit> . it is not known however whether alterations in cr pathways, as found in agat, gamt or ct <dig> deficiencies, impairs the development of the embryo.

agat and gamt for de novo synthesis of cr in the embryo
as both substrates arginine  and s-adenosylmethionine  are available for most tissues  during the mammalian embryonic development  <cit> , our study suggests that the rat embryo might be able of its own cr synthesis as soon as e <dig> , in the hepatic primordium which expresses both agat and gamt. from e <dig>  to e <dig> , both enzymes then progressively acquire their expression pattern found in aduldhood, with agat mainly expressed in kidney and pancreas, and gamt preferentially localized in liver and pancreas . as in adulthood however, many other different embryonic tissues retain low levels of agat and/or gamt; we found that skeletal muscles and intestinal epithelial cells at e <dig>  are equipped to synthesize their own cr by expressing both agat and gamt. a few embryonic structures express only agat  suggesting that they have to release the intermediate gaa, that has to be transported to gamt-expressing cells for cr synthesis to occur, as it is generally thought between kidney  and liver  in adult mammals. a few embryonic structures  showed a striking and very high expression of agat. this might be explained by the strong and positive regulation of agat, at the transcriptional level, by thyroid, growth and sex hormones  <cit> , which do control the embryonic development of somites, skeletal muscles and gonads  <cit> .

while this study shows that agat is expressed as soon as e <dig>  in the whole cns parenchyme and increases towards e <dig> , it demonstrates also that gamt expression in the developing cns is delayed, and remains at low levels as compared to agat. adult rat cns appears to be able of synthesizing its own cr by expressing agat and gamt in most cell types of the brain  <cit> ; in contrast, our work suggests that independance of cns for its own cr synthesis is probably limited to the end of embryogenesis and restricted to discrete regions of cns. thus, the embryonic brain might depend mainly on extra-cns supply of cr, be it of maternal origin or synthesized in other tissues of the embryo .

ct <dig> for the supply of cr to embryonic tissues
from e <dig>  to e <dig> , most of the embryonic tissues progressively express ct <dig>  allowing cellular cr uptake. notable exceptions are liver  and pancreas, which express gamt, and endothelial cells of brain capillaries . these results are in accordance with earlier work on the e <dig> rat embryo  <cit> . highest levels of ct <dig> are found as soon as e <dig> , in tissues requiring high amounts of cr, like somites, skeletal muscles and cns. in gonads, ct <dig> and gamt appeared at e <dig>  only, while agat was highly expressed at e <dig>  and decreased at e <dig> . this is in accordance with their respective expression in the adult reproductive tract  <cit> . ct <dig>  a second potential cr transporter showing 95% nucleotide identity with the ct <dig> coding sequence, has been found expressed in testis solely, at the rna level  <cit> . however, ct <dig> most probably represents a pseudogene, as it cannot be fully translated into a functional protein  <cit> , suggesting that the needs in cr of the reproductive tract are fulfilled by ct <dig>  as well as agat and gamt.

the delayed and low level of gamt expression during cns embryogenesis suggests that the embryonic brain might depend on extra-cns supply of cr. this is supported by our results on ct <dig>  which is expressed at high levels in the whole embryonic cns, with a peak at e <dig> . interestingly, ct <dig> is expressed in the choroid plexus of the rat embryo , but not of the adult rat brain  <cit> . in contrast, ct <dig> is absent from endothelial cells of brain capillaries in the embryo, while these cells express it in the adult rat cns  <cit> . as choroid plexus differentiates earlier than brain capillaries and participates to early trophic supply for cns  <cit> , one might speculate that before angiogenesis occurs in cns parenchyme, extra-cns cr is supplied from blood to cerebrospinal fluid through the choroid plexus. cr would then be available for the whole embryonic brain through cerebrospinal fluid circulation  <cit>  and the observed high levels of ct <dig> in the developing neuroepithelium, particularly in ependymal epithelium along ventricles . as brain develops and enlarges, and cns angiogenesis progresses, the ratio of exchange surfaces in choroid plexus and cns microcapillaries shifts to predominance of brain microcapillaries  <cit> . thus, at the end of embryonic development and then postnatally, cr supply to the brain may occur preferentially at microcapillaries, with ct <dig> being up-regulated in capillary endothelial cells and down-regulated in choroid plexus, as in adulthood  <cit> . it should be emphasized however that supply of cr from blood to postnatal or adult brain is very likely of less quantitative importance than intra-cerebral cr synthesis, as astrocytes around blood brain barrier do not express ct <dig>  <cit> .

at e <dig>  and e <dig> , ct <dig> was found highly expressed in all epithelia of the rat embryo being in contact with amniotic fluid, i.e. epidermis, olfactory epithelium, trachea, lung, stomach, and intestine. cr uptake has been confirmed recently in e <dig> rat embryo intestine  <cit> . amniotic fluid contains significant amounts of cr . it is produced by amniotic cells  and the foetus, and is continuously renewed by oral intake of the foetus and excretion . amniotic fluid may thus represent an easy way to supply cr to many structures of the embryo, through epithelial expression of ct <dig> in embryonic parts where vasculature is not yet fully developed.

it is known that cr is also supplied by active transport from the mother to the embryo, accumulating in the chorioallantoic placenta and yolk sac at concentrations higher than found in maternal or fetal blood, then diffusing down its concentration gradient into the fetal circulation  <cit> . thus previous studies, as well as our data, suggest that materno-fetal transport of cr and de novo synthesis of cr in the embryo are both necessary for a normal development to occur.

in utero consequences of agat, gamt or ct <dig> deficiencies
patients suffering of agat, gamt or ct <dig> deficiency present neurological symptoms in early infancy and show severe neurodevelopmental delay  <cit> . agat and gamt deficiencies can be treated with oral cr, which slowly replenishes brain levels of cr  <cit> . treatment of ct <dig> deficient patients with oral cr does not replenish their cns cr level  <cit> . despite developmental improvement and recovery of agat and gamt deficient patients treated with cr, sequelae to brain development and mental retardation remain  <cit> . for gamt deficiency, this may be due to the toxicity of the gaa accumulating in cns. most patients with agat, gamt or ct <dig> deficiencies are diagnosed during infancy, and significant damage to their brain occur postnatally. however, agat, gamt and ct <dig> expression patterns during the rat embryogenesis suggests that some of the irreversible damages observed in cr deficient patients, lacking either agat, gamt or ct <dig>  may already occur in utero.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that agat, gamt and ct <dig> are expressed by various tissues throughout the development of the rat embryo. this study suggests that de novo synthesis of cr and cr uptake are important for embryonic development. this work provides new clues on how creatine can be provided to developing tissues, and suggests moreover that irreversible damage observed in cr deficient patients, lacking either agat, gamt or ct <dig>  may already occur in utero.
