BACKGROUND
recently the molecular based approaches of super-ordinal grouping of extant eutherians  has gained popularity  <cit> . however, one of the four proposed super-orders, afrotheria, is controversial because it unites morphologically distinct species of african placentals . within afrotheria, sirenians, elephants and hyraxes form a clade called paenungulata. there is little morphological or paleontological evidence that provides support for afrotheria  <cit> . a movable snout was hypothesized as a synapomorphic trait, but this feature is apparently not homologous across different afrotherian lineages <cit> . more recently, it was proposed that aspects of placentation could provide a synapomorphy for this assemblage  <cit> . some outstanding issues in higher eutherian phylogenomics include the exact root of the placental tree, the relationships within the super-ordinal clade laurasiatheria , and resolving the trichotomy of sirenians, elephants and hyraxes  <cit> .

sirenia and hyracoidea are the two afrotherian orders remaining to be investigated with molecular cytogenetic techniques. in this paper, the chromosome painting of the florida manatee  is reported. these data should be a valuable addition to our understanding of afrotherian relationships and the eutherian ancestral karyotype.

the florida manatee
the endangered florida manatee is a subspecies of the west indian manatee  in the order sirenia. sirenians are often considered phylogenetic outliers. despite similarities in adaptations, habitat, and body shape, they have no evolutionary relationship with the other orders of marine mammals. extant sirenians are the only herbivorous marine mammals and live in fresh, brackish or marine habitats dispersed along tropical and subtropical environments.

previous cytogenetic reports on manatees
solid stained chromosome studies were completed on a limited number of individual manatees, establishing the chromosome number as 2n =  <dig> for the florida manatee  <cit>  and 2n =  <dig> for the amazonian manatee   <cit> . following solid staining, chromosome-banding procedures allowed for the identification of individual chromosome regions. giemsa and trypsin staining, or gtg-banding, was used to create karyotypes and ideograms for the florida manatee  <cit>  and the amazonian manatee  <cit> .

comparisons of chromosome painting data provide an independent test of the contrasting hypotheses on mammalian evolution and phylogeny. the research presented here clarifies the phylogenetic position of the manatee and tests the validity of the radical taxonomic assemblage known as afrotheria. the results are then compared to other chromosome painting data in afrotheria. in light of the findings, the relationships within afrotheria and the alternative organizations of the ancestral eutherian karyotype are assessed.

RESULTS
examples of human chromosome paints  hybridized to manatee  metaphase chromosomes are shown in figure  <dig>  synteny was found intact in nine  of the  <dig> human autosomal and x chromosomes . two hybridization signals were evident on separate manatee chromosomes for ten human chromosomes . the human  <dig> paint hybridized to three tma chromosomes . human chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> were highly fragmented in the manatee genome and painted four and five chromosomes, respectively . due to the small signals involved and the quality of the metaphases, it was more difficult to assign the hybridization pattern for these two chromosomes. human chromosome paint  <dig> provided three signals on tma  <dig>  most likely due to an inversion. chromosome paints with pericentromeric signals on both arms of the same chromosome were considered as one signal. centromere areas on the manatee karyotype were not hybridized. the y chromosome was the only human probe that failed to provide a signal in the manatee. altogether, the human autosomal chromosome paints and the x chromosome paint delimited a total of  <dig> homologous segments in the manatee genome. human chromosome paints hybridized to  <dig>  segments in the manatee genome: 1/ <dig>  1/ <dig>  2/ <dig> , 3/ <dig> , 3/ <dig>  3/ <dig>  5/ <dig>  7/ <dig>  8/ <dig>  10/ <dig> , 11/ <dig>  12/ <dig> , 14/ <dig>  16/ <dig> and 18/ <dig>

discussion
the painting map of the manatee genome was compared with results published on other afrotheria taxa: aardvark, elephant, elephant shrew and golden mole  <cit> . an assessment of the associations found in each taxa are shown in table  <dig>  all species have eight associations in common . five of these associations are considered ancestral to all eutherians by most proposals . it appears that the associations 1/ <dig> and 5/ <dig> can be used to link afrotherian species  <cit> . these associations provide cytogenetic support, in agreement with molecular studies, that afrotheria is a natural clade.

new chromosome painting data in xenarthra  are also informative towards the ancestral eutherian karyotype. of the four species studied, tamandua tetradactyla, choloepus didactylus, c. hoffmanii and dasypus novemcinctus  <cit> , only the anteater has a 1/ <dig> association. it is not likely that this association is homologous to afrotheria, because the anteater has the most highly rearranged karyotype known in xenarthra  <cit> .

the manatee data indicate that the association 10/12/ <dig> is most likely ubiquitous throughout afrotheria. a combination hsa10p/12p/22q and a single hsa10q were found in the aardvark and elephant karyotypes  <cit> . an apparently identical association was later found in the elephant shrew and golden mole  <cit> . the question is, whether this association is a third cytogenetic landmark for the afrotheria clade, or instead should be considered part of the ancestral eutherian karyotype.

the entire 10/12/ <dig> association appears to be present in clades i, afrotheria, and iv, laurasiatheria, only partially present in clade ii, xenarthra , and absent in clade iii, euarchontoglires . carnivores have a homologous 10/12/ <dig> association to afrotheria, as demonstrated by reciprocal chromosome painting  <cit> . eulipotyphla  also have the 10/12/ <dig> association  <cit> . chromosome painting data in xenarthra show that a 10/ <dig> association is present in the armadillo   <cit> . to date, the 10/ <dig> association has been found in three of the four eutherian mammal clades. yet, there is no reciprocal painting in xenarthra to prove that the 10/ <dig> association is truly homologous to that found in afrotheria. several hypotheses can be developed with different implications if afrotheria or xenarthra is considered basal. if afrotheria is basal, the occurrence of 10/12/ <dig> in clades i and iv would suggest that this association is part of the ancestral eutherian karyotype with a subsequent, independent loss in clades ii and iii. the occurrence of the 10/12/ <dig> association clades i and iv, could be considered a phylogenetic link. alternatively, the association could have been independently acquired in the two clades. if xenarthra is basal, this association could have originated in afrotheria and was then lost in clade iii.

association 3/ <dig> was found in the manatee, elephant and elephant shrew. however, there are no reciprocal painting data between human and manatee or human and elephant shrew. therefore, it is not possible to confirm that the 3/ <dig> association is homologous . in view of the afrotherian molecular data, this association was independently derived in the macroscelidae  and paenungulata phylogenetic lineages  <cit> .

support for the tethytheria and paenungulata assemblage
before the advent of molecular studies, some morphologists placed sirenians, elephants and hyraxes under ungulata. elephants and sirenians were grouped together in tethytheria, while hyraxes were placed in phenacodonta along with perissodactyls  <cit> . results in molecular studies are inconsistent and fail to resolve the paenungulate trifurcation  <cit>  and some data do not support tethytheria  <cit> . mitochondrial genome analyses do support tethytheria, but exclude hyracoidea  <cit> . sine insertion data produced incongruent phylogenetic relationships within paenungulata, most likely due to a rapid divergence from a highly polymorphic last common ancestor  <cit> .

the chromosome mapping data strongly support tethytheria  and implies support for the clade paenungulata . there appear to be four derived associations linking elephants with manatees: 2/ <dig>  3/ <dig>  8/ <dig> and 18/ <dig>  hsa 4/8p was not present in the manatee and may represent a derived trait of paenungulata. both publications on the elephant indicate that this association is also lacking  <cit> . it is possible that the 4/ <dig> association went undetected in our study, as well as in elephants. although, the widespread occurrence of the 4/ <dig> association in all mammals, outside of elephants and most primates, lends credence to its inclusion in the ancestral eutherian karyotype. it would be useful to test these hypotheses with rock hyrax chromosome painting data.

branching order in afrotheria
the branching order within afrotheria has not reached a consensus. some authors have viewed macroscelidae, the elephant shrews, as the most basal and early divergent order within afrotheria  <cit> . however, murphy et al.  placed the triumvirate of sirenians, elephants and hyraxes  as basal, verified by additional molecular data  <cit> . it is difficult to determine which order is most basal because sirenians and elephants, like other afrotherian species, have fairly derived karyotypes.

according to robinson et al. , associations 2/ <dig>  3/ <dig> and 10/ <dig> link elephant shrews, golden moles/tenrecs and aardvarks. only the association 2/ <dig> is present in all three. recently, the association 2/ <dig> was also found in anteater , sloth  and pangolin   <cit> . associations 3/ <dig> and 10/ <dig> are lacking in golden moles/tenrecs. murphy et al.  proposed that the associations 3/ <dig> and 10/ <dig> were probably lost in golden moles/tenrecs. no reciprocal painting was done in elephant shrews or golden moles/tenrecs and it is therefore unknown if these associations are actually homologous. there is weak cytogenetic evidence linking elephant shrews and golden moles/tenrecs. an alternate hypothesis might be a sister relationship between elephant shrews and aardvarks. perhaps a rapid divergence in elephant shrews, golden moles/tenrecs and aardvarks also resulted in limited phylogenetic signals for these chromosome associations.

the root of the eutherian tree
although the super-order assemblies appear well established, the most basal position on the eutherian tree has not been determined with certainty  <cit> . afrotheria and xenarthra are the two oldest eutherian clades and probably emerged from the southern hemisphere in excess of  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . molecular dating and biogeography have provided evidence that crown-group eutheria may have their most recent common ancestry in the southern hemisphere   <cit> . the other two clades  can be grouped as boreoeutheria  <cit> .

there are currently three hypotheses for the root of the eutherian tree. most discussions from molecular studies place emphasis on either afrotheria or xenarthra as the most basal clade  <cit> . a third hypothesis states that the ancestral eutherian karyotype is a combination of both clades. this hypothesis cannot be completely ruled out and is preferred in some studies  <cit> . however, the suite of derived chromosomal associations found in all studied afrotheria argues against the hypothesis that a combination of the two clades is basal to the eutherians.

recently, a report on retroelements gives support for the hypothesis that xenarthra is the sister group to all other placentals  <cit> . indeed, new cytogenetic comparisons show that the proposed ancestral eutherian karyotype is essentially conserved in xenarthra, specifically in the two-toed sloth   <cit> . these two studies should be given attention because both take into consideration rare genomic events in which convergence is particularly limited. the conserved xenarthran karyotype may well be indicative of their phylogenomic position among eutherians. however, an essential point is that all reconstructions of the ancestral eutherian karyotype are preliminary until a relevant outgroup is studied with chromosome painting. a taxonomically rich array of species supported by appropriate out-groups is vital to the reconstruction of mammalian genome evolution. the deficiency of comparative chromosome painting data between eutherians and marsupials is a severe limitation on attempts to delineate the mammalian ancestral genome. the analyses of other afrotherians, xenarthrans and marsupials may clarify these unresolved questions.

CONCLUSIONS
the chromosome painting data presented here leave little doubt that tethytheria is a clade within afrotheria and implies support for the paenungulata assemblage. recent retroposon data also confirmed paenungulata, but could not resolve the phylogenetic relationships among elephants, sirenians and hyraxes  <cit> . it is generally appreciated that characters with high evolutionary rates provide good phylogenetic resolution. afrotherian karyotypes demonstrate high rates of chromosome evolution and numerous derived inter-chromosomal rearrangements link elephants and manatees. it is therefore likely that additional chromosome painting in rock hyraxes could shed light on the divergence sequence and resolve the paenungulata trichotomy.
