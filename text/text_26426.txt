BACKGROUND
the production of haploid gametes from diploid germ cells during meiosis is fundamental for sexual reproduction. haploid gametes are produced by a single round of premeiotic dna replication followed by two rounds of chromosome segregation. ploidy reduction depends on features of chromosome behaviour that are specific to the first meiotic division  <cit> . one key feature is the pairing of homologous chromosomes  during the first meiotic prophase. high fidelity pairing of homologues requires chromosome movements, which are driven by the active movement of telomeres along the nuclear envelope  in diverse taxa  <cit> . at the onset of meiotic prophase, telomeres associate with protein complexes that span the ne, and provide physical linkage between telomeres and cytoplasmic motor proteins. hence, attachment of telomeres to the ne enables cytoplasmic motors to move telomeres along the ne  <cit> .

trans-ne protein complexes that connect telomeres to cytoplasmic motors contain sun- and kash-domain proteins, which are imbedded in the inner and the outer ne membrane, respectively  <cit> . in various yeast species, telomeres are tethered to the sun-domain inner ne protein through meiosis-specific protein complexes  <cit> . in fission yeast, the linkage of telomeres to the sun-domain  protein requires at least two meiosis-specific connector proteins, bqt <dig> and  <dig>  whose interaction with telomeres depends on the telomeric dna repeat-binding protein taz <dig> and sprap <dig>  <cit> . although rap <dig> is a constitutive component of mammalian telomeres and is the predicted mammalian orthologue of sprap <dig>  it is not required for telomere-ne interaction in mice  <cit> , nevertheless, sun-domain proteins, sun <dig>  <cit>  and possibly sun <dig>  <cit> , are required for tethering telomeres to the ne during meiosis in mice. these two proteins are present in the inner ne both in somatic and meiotic cells. therefore, meiosis-specific modifications to constitutive telomere proteins, or additional meiosis-specific telomere components, must exist in order to establish telomere-ne attachments in mammalian meiocytes.

in addition to telomere-ne attachment, protection of chromosome ends during meiotic prophase requires meiosis-specific changes in telomere biology  <cit> . the shelterin complex/telosome is employed in both somatic and meiotic cells to safeguard chromosome ends from dna-damage response and enzymatic attacks, and to ensure maintenance of telomere length  <cit> . although somatic and meiotic telomeres share known shelterin components, e.g. trf <dig>  trf <dig> and rap <dig>  maintaining the stability of telomeres during meiosis is known to require an additional factor, possibly due to meiosis specific-features of recombination. the meiosis-specific cohesin smc1b is required for both telomere stability and efficient telomere-ne attachment during the first meiotic prophase  <cit> . however, the function of smc1b in telomere biology is not well understood, and the molecular nature of meiosis-specific telomere modifications remains largely unexplored.

here we report, in line with a recently published study  <cit> , that the coiled-coil-domain containing protein  <dig>  is a meiosis specific telomere-associated protein in mice. by investigating the behaviour of ccdc <dig> in wild type , sun1-deficient and smc1b-deficient meiocytes, we identify ccdc <dig> as a candidate for mediating meiotic telomere-ne interaction and for stabilising meiotic telomeres in mammals.

RESULTS
expression of ccdc <dig> is restricted to male and female meiotic germ cells
to identify uncharacterised proteins that are possibly involved in meiotic chromosome biology, we screened for mouse genes whose expression is upregulated in the developing gonads upon entry of germ cells into the first meiotic prophase in both sexes . ccdc <dig> was one of the identified genes.

we examined the expression pattern of ccdc <dig> in detail in postnatal testis at different developmental stages by rt-pcr . in mouse testis, the first wave of meiotic entry in germ cells occurs at 8– <dig> days post-partum , however the germ cell population is maintained mitotically and produces cells that initiate meiosis throughout the life of males. expression of ccdc <dig> was not detected in testes at  <dig> and  <dig> dpp, where germ cells have not yet entered meiosis. ccdc <dig> expression became apparent at  <dig> dpp, coinciding with the onset of meiosis in male gonads. once meiosis was initiated, ccdc <dig> expression level increased until  <dig> dpp, and remained high in adult testis. unlike in males, germ cells enter meiosis only once during foetal development in the female gonads. meiotic prophase is initiated in ovaries around  <dig> - <dig>  days post coitum . thereafter, oocytes progress through stages of meiotic prophase relatively synchronously. consequently, ovaries are highly enriched for germ cells of a distinct sub-stage of the first meiotic prophase at any one stage of foetal ovary development. expression of ccdc <dig> was not detected in ovaries at  <dig>  or  <dig>  dpc, but we found strong expression of ccdc <dig> in  <dig>  dpc ovaries , where the majority of oocytes have entered the first meiotic prophase. the expression of ccdc <dig> gradually declined in later developmental stages, as oocytes progressed through prophase to the dictyate/g <dig> stage.

having established that ccdc <dig> is upregulated in the gonads at the time of the first meiotic prophase, we tested if ccdc <dig> was expressed in somatic tissues. we compared ccdc <dig> expression in the testis to  <dig> somatic tissues by rt pcr . preferential expression of ccdc <dig> was detected in the testis of adult mice, indicating that ccdc <dig> is largely restricted to tissues that contain meiotic cells. we then asked if ccdc <dig> is expressed specifically in meiotic germ cells. using fluorescence-activated cell sorting to separate somatic cell populations and prophase stage oocytes from foetal ovaries  <cit> , we measured ccdc <dig> expression in the sorted cell populations by rt-pcr . ccdc <dig> expression was detected in oocytes and was not detected in somatic ovarian cells, indicating that ccdc <dig> expression is restricted to meiotic cell types.

ccdc <dig> shares similarities with sequence specific dna-binding proteins
we cloned the open reading frame of ccdc <dig> from adult testis cdna, and reconfirmed its predicted length of 2304 bp. ccdc <dig> encodes for a protein of  <dig> aa, which is highly conserved in vertebrates, with an identity of 72% between the sequence of murine ccdc <dig> and its human homologue. ccdc <dig> is characterized by an n-terminal armadillo repeat and a c-terminal sant/myb-like domain. armadillo repeat domains are known to mediate protein-protein interactions in a wide range of proteins with diverse functions . myb-like domains of the sant superfamily  <cit>   are helix-turn-helix protein regions, which allow sequence specific interactions of proteins with dna. a prominent example is the dna-binding domain of the proto-oncogene c-myb  <cit> , to which members of the protein family are structurally related. myb-like protein domains occur mainly as multiple repeats in proteins with diverse functions. however, myb-like domains, in particular a single copy of the domain in the c-terminal, have emerged as being characteristic for proteins interacting with telomeric dna sequences in a wide range of species e.g. in yeast, plants and mammals  <cit> . a consensus sequence, called the telobox, has been determined for such telomere-binding myb-like domains in comparative studies, which revealed that the telobox can be distinguished from myb-like domains of other sequence specific dna-binding proteins  <cit> . alignment of ccdc <dig> with the dna-interacting domain of c-myb and with the telobox revealed that the myb-like domain of ccdc <dig> is more similar to the telobox  than to the dna-interacting myb-like domain of c-myb . based on this observation and the c-terminal position of the myb-like domain in ccdc <dig>  we hypothesised a role for the protein in meiotic telomere biology.

ccdc <dig> associates with telomeres during the first meiotic prophase
to gain insight into the possible functions of ccdc <dig> during meiosis we raised antisera against a c-terminal  <dig> aa peptide of the protein and affinity purified the anti-ccdc <dig> antibodies . to examine the cellular localization of ccdc <dig> in meiocytes we performed immunofluorescence  for ccdc <dig> and the axial element component sycp <dig> on surface spread nuclei of adult testis . the pattern of anti-sycp <dig> staining was used to identify spermatocytes at distinct sub-stages of meiosis prophase i. ccdc <dig> first appeared in leptotene as foci on the chromatin. during early-zygotene it appeared that the ccdc <dig> foci co-localized with the ends of forming axial elements. indeed, accumulation of ccdc <dig> as foci on virtually all the chromosome ends became apparent once axial elements had formed along the entire length of chromosomes in late-zygotene and pachytene, which suggested ccdc <dig> localization to telomeric regions of the chromosomes. the association of ccdc <dig> to the ends of chromosome axes was detected until diplotene. ccdc <dig> staining of chromosome ends weakened as the chromosome axis disassembled, concurrent with the progression from prophase to the first meiotic metaphase . we did not detect a distinct anti-ccdc <dig> signal in spermatocytes after the first meiotic division, or in nuclear surface spreads of somatic testis cells. ccdc <dig> localization in oocytes resembled the localization observed in spermatocytes, i.e. ccdc <dig> associates to chromosome ends throughout the first meiotic prophase in oocytes and disappears from telomeres after progression to the dictyate stage . antibodies against ccdc <dig> obtained from the sera of two different animals showed similar immunostaining patterns in if experiments, and were validated for specificity by immunolabeling of ccdc79-deficient spermatocytes as a negative control . gfp tagged versions of ccdc <dig> overexpressed in testis have been recently reported also to localize to telomeres  <cit> , reconfirming the observed immunostaining pattern.

localization of ccdc <dig> to chromosome ends tightly correlates with establishment of telomere-ne attachment during early prophase
at the onset of the first meiotic prophase, chromosomes ends are recruited to the ne via their interaction with specialized attachment sites. these structures contain the inner nuclear membrane protein sun <dig>  due to the proximity of telomeres and sun <dig> in the telomere attachment plates, light microscopy cannot resolve immunofluorescence detected signals of sun <dig> and telomere proteins, such as trf <dig>  which are therefore detected as single co-localised foci. accordingly, we found that ccdc <dig> foci co-localised with both trf <dig> and sun <dig> foci  at the ends of nearly all chromosome axes in pachytene spermatocytes that were co-immunolabeled by anti-ccdc <dig>  anti-trf <dig> and anti-sun <dig> antibodies .

given our finding that ccdc <dig> foci first appeared in leptotene, it was possible that ccdc <dig> association with telomeres coincided with the attachment of telomeres to the ne and with the formation of telomere attachment plates. to test this possibility we detected ccdc <dig>  trf <dig> and sun <dig> in surface spreads of early-leptotene spermatocytes and quantified co-localization between the foci of these proteins . we found that the vast majority  of trf <dig> foci, which constitutively marks telomeres, was associated with both anti-ccdc <dig> and anti-sun <dig> signal. the second largest fraction  of trf <dig> foci co-localized with neither ccdc <dig> nor sun <dig>  and only very small fractions of foci showed co-localization with either ccdc <dig>  or sun <dig>  foci. thus, ccdc <dig> tends to associate with telomeres that also bind to sun <dig> in both leptotene and pachytene, and ccdc <dig> is missing from the majority of telomeres that lack sun <dig> in the early leptotene stage. this indicates that ccdc <dig> association with telomeres largely coincides with the initiation of telomere-ne attachment in wt spermatocytes.

telomeres that fail to attach to the ne tend to lack ccdc <dig> in smc1b-deficient spermatocytes
the observation that ccdc <dig> was preferentially associated with telomeres that established connection to the ne in early prophase wt spermatocytes indicated that ccdc <dig> might be a constituent of protein complexes that connect telomeres to the cytoplasmic cytoskeleton through the ne. to test this hypothesis, we addressed if ccdc <dig> localisation to telomeres correlated with telomere attachment to the ne in a genetic background where telomere association with the ne was partially disrupted due to a deficiency in smc1b . smc1b is a meiosis specific sub-unit of the cohesin complex which is required for correct chromosome axes length, orderly synaptonemal complex formation between homologous chromosomes, telomere stability, and efficient telomere-ne attachment during meiotic prophase  <cit> . a subset of telomeres fails to attach to the ne, as evidenced by the absence of sun <dig> from such telomeres in smc1b-deficient spermatocytes. to address if ccdc <dig> localized to telomeres that failed to attach to ne, we detected ccdc <dig>  trf <dig>  sun <dig> and sycp <dig> in smc1b-deficient spermatocytes by immunolabeling . we found that the vast majority  of telomeres that bound to ccdc <dig> also bound to sun <dig> . in addition, most telomeres  that lacked ccdc <dig> failed to bind sun <dig> in smc1b-/- spermatocytes .

thus, there is a strong correlation between the localization of ccdc <dig> to telomeres and the attachment of telomeres to the ne in both wt and smc1b-/- spermatocytes, consistent with the possibility that ccdc <dig> constitutes part of the protein complex that forms bridges between chromosome ends and the cytoplasmic cytoskeleton during meiotic prophase.

recruitment of ccdc <dig> to telomeres is independent of meiotic telomere attachment
the strong correlation between the telomere-ne attachment and the localization of ccdc <dig> to meiotic telomeres raises the possibility that ccdc <dig> localization is a prerequisite for telomere-ne attachment, or that telomere-ne attachment is a prerequisite for ccdc <dig> localization. to test the latter, we examined the localization of ccdc <dig> in sun <dig> -/- spermatocytes , in which the telomere-ne attachment is severely impaired. we observed wt–like localization of ccdc <dig> foci to chromosome ends  in the absence of sun <dig>  thus, ccdc <dig> is able to interact with telomeric structures independent of telomere attachment to the ne.

discussion
telomeres perform meiosis-specific functions that are essential for ploidy reduction and maintenance of genome integrity during meiosis. to facilitate active chromosome movements and ensure high fidelity pairing of homologues during early meiotic prophase, telomeres must attach to trans-ne protein complexes, thereby establishing a link to cytoplasmic motor proteins  <cit> . dna double strand breaks are introduced into the genome and are required for homologue pairing and formation of inter-homologue crossovers. the breaks are subsequently repaired by recombination machinery that is substantially altered during meiosis, in comparison to mitosis  <cit> . chromosomal dna ends resemble dna double strand breaks, and one of the main roles of telomeres is to protect chromosome ends and prevent undesired recombination events. it is therefore expected that meiotic telomeres need to adapt to meiosis-specific characteristics of recombination  <cit> . consistent with this notion, maintenance of the structural integrity of telomeres during the first meiotic prophase requires the meiosis-specific cohesin smc1b  <cit> . despite the importance of these meiosis-specific features of telomere biology, the molecular changes in telomeres that underpin telomere-ne attachment and maintenance of telomere integrity during meiosis have remained largely unexplored.

we identified ccdc <dig> as a protein that associates with telomeres specifically during the first meiotic prophase in mice. we found that ccdc <dig> and sun <dig> association with telomeres tightly correlated with each other in both wt and smc1b-deficient meiocytes. this indicates that ccdc <dig> association with telomeres coincides with telomere attachment to the sun <dig> containing trans-ne protein complexes.

we further tested the relationship between ccdc <dig> and telomere-ne attachment by examining ccdc <dig> localization in the sun1-/- spermatocytes, where telomeres attachment to the ne is severely reduced. the observation that ccdc <dig> localization to chromosome ends is unaffected in sun1-deficient spermatocytes shows that ccdc <dig> localization to telomeres does not depend on sun <dig> and telomere-ne attachment. this also indicates that ccdc <dig> is not part of the protein complex that extends from sun <dig> toward the cytoplasmic motors through the ne. rather, these observations are consistent with the possibility that ccdc <dig> is positioned between the telomeric dna and sun <dig> at sites of telomere-ne attachment.

in agreement with this scenario, ccdc <dig> contains a telobox-like myb domain at its c terminus, a feature that is shared by shelterin complex components that bind to telomeric repeats  <cit> . thus, the domain structure of ccdc <dig> indicates a potential for ccdc <dig> to interact directly with telomeric repeats.

our observations indicate a role for ccdc <dig> in meiotic telomere biology. in particular, the behaviour of ccdc <dig> in smc1b-deficient meiocytes is informative. in the absence of the meiosis-specific smc1b cohesin, meiocytes display a diverse set of telomere phenotypes during prophase. these include a failure to attach 13-20% of telomeres to the ne , and structural abnormalities that affect a subset of telomeres in each individual meiocyte. such structural abnormalities include shortening of telomeres, detachment of telomeres from the meiotic chromosome axes, telomere fusions, and the formation of stretched out telomeres  <cit> . importantly, failure of telomeres in ne attachment is correlated with the absence of ccdc <dig> from telomeres  and with shortened telomere length  <cit> , and is not correlated with other structural abnormalities of telomeres in smc1b-/- meiocytes  <cit> . thus, our experiments identify ccdc <dig> as a protein that may contribute to both the stabilization of telomeres during meiosis and the formation of a “bridge” that tethers telomeres to sun <dig> and the inner ne.

consistent with these findings, an independently initiated study recently revealed key roles for ccdc <dig>  in the recruitment of telomeres to the ne and in the recruitment of cohesins to telomeres to maintain the structural integrity of telomeres during meiosis  <cit> . given these ccdc <dig> functions, our observation that efficient ccdc <dig> recruitment to telomeres requires the meiotic cohesin smc1b indicates synergy and mutual dependency between ccdc <dig> and meiotic cohesion functions at telomeres. at this point it remains unresolved if smc1b and/or other cohesins have a direct role in ccdc <dig> recruitment to telomeres or if this role is more indirect and is exerted via stabilisation of telomere length and structure. future experiments are required to address this question, as well as to dissect the functional interaction between meiotic cohesins, ccdc <dig> and telomeres, and also to provide a mechanistic understanding of the behaviour and functions of meiotic telomeres in mammals.

CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that the meiosis-specific protein ccdc <dig> and its functional interaction with meiotic cohesins are involved in the meiosis-specific behaviour of telomeres. investigation of the molecular functions of ccdc <dig> will provide an opportunity to explore, at the molecular level, meiosis-specific aspects of mammalian telomere biology that have been inaccessible, despite their apparent importance in ensuring a high fidelity of meiotic recombination and the integrity of the genome in the germline.
