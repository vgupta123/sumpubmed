BACKGROUND
histones have n- and c-terminal tails and core fold domains that are subject to multiple post-translational modifications such as acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitylation and methylation. the lysine residues of histones can be mono-, di- or trimethylated  and serve as docking sites for various regulatory factors including transcription factors, chromatin-remodeling complexes or histone-modifying enzymes, depending on which lysine residue is methylated. in general, histone h <dig> methylation at k <dig> , k <dig>  or k <dig>  is primarily associated with gene activation, whereas h <dig> methylation at k <dig> or k <dig> and h <dig> methylation at k <dig> are mainly associated with gene repression .

it is now evident that histone methylation is dynamically regulated by histone demethylases. in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, there are five jumonji c  domain-containing histone demethylases : jhd <dig>  jhd <dig>  rph <dig>  gis <dig> and ecm <dig>  jhd1/kdm <dig> is a jhdm <dig> ortholog and has demethylase activity toward h3k36me <dig> and h3k36me <dig> in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . this demethylase is necessary for promoting transcription elongation through the removal of h3k <dig> methylation, a repressive chromatin mark generated by set <dig>  <cit> . jhd2/kdm <dig> is an evolutionarily conserved jarid <dig> family protein that has demethylase activity toward h3k4me <dig> in vitro or in vivo  <cit> . other groups have also shown that jhd <dig> demethylates all forms of h3k <dig> methylation in vitro or in vivo  <cit> . demethylation by jhd <dig> was originally shown to regulate telomeric silencing; loss of jhd <dig> enhances telomeric silencing, and overexpression of jhd <dig> counteracts this effect  <cit> . additionally, the ability of jhd <dig> to associate with chromatin to modulate h3k <dig> methylation on both active and repressed genes has been reported  <cit> . the rph1/kdm <dig> and gis <dig> demethylases are jhdm3/jmjd <dig> orthologs and have in vivo demethylase activity toward h3k36me3/ <dig> and h3k36me2/ <dig>  respectively  <cit> . although rph <dig>  like jhd <dig>  positively affects transcription  <cit> , little is known about gis <dig>  ecm <dig> contains a jmjc domain, but its demethylase activity is still unclear  <cit> .

in eukaryotic genomes, rrna genes  exist in multicopy tandem arrays with a variable number of units among organisms, ranging from fewer than  <dig> to more than  <dig>  copies. in humans, the clusters of rdna repeats, termed nucleolar organizer regions , are composed of  <dig> to  <dig> copies per haploid genome of a 43-kb unit and are located on five different chromosomes:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . the budding yeast rdna is organized with  <dig> to  <dig> copies of tandemly repeated  <dig> -kb units on chromosome xii and is localized to the nucleolus. this rdna unit consists of a 5s rrna gene that is transcribed by rna polymerase iii and a 35s pre-rrna gene that is transcribed by rna polymerase i; the two genes are separated by two nontranscribed spacers , nts <dig> and nts <dig>  <cit> . the nucleolar rdna is tightly associated with silent heterochromatin, which serves an important role in nucleolar function. indeed, loss of silencing in the rdna regions correlates with rdna instability, nucleolar disintegration and cellular senescence  <cit> . the rent complex, which is composed of net <dig>  sir <dig> and cdc <dig>  is required for rdna silencing. net <dig> is the core subunit of the rent complex, and it tethers sir <dig> to rdna, regulating the exit from mitosis by sequestering cdc <dig> until the telophase . in particular, net <dig> and sir <dig> are preferentially associated with both the nts <dig> and nts2/polymerase i promoter regions. fob <dig> is required for rdna silencing through the recruitment of net <dig> and sir <dig> to the replication fork barrier  site within nts <dig>  a region that overlaps the e element of the mitotic recombination hotspot hot <dig>  <cit> . little is known about how net <dig> or sir <dig> associate with nts <dig> 

recent studies suggest a distinct mechanism that regulates rdna silencing, separate from the sir2-dependent pathway. this sir2-independent silencing mechanism includes tof <dig> and two additional proteins, csm <dig> and lrs <dig>  which are subunits of the previously identified monopolin complex that is required for co-orientation in meiosis i  <cit> . tof <dig> is required for rdna silencing and is primarily recruited to nts <dig> through association with fob <dig>  <cit> . likewise, both csm <dig> and lrs <dig> primarily associate with nts <dig> in a fob1- and tof2-dependent manner and are required for silencing at nts <dig> as well. indeed, the deletion of either csm <dig> or lrs <dig> has little effect on sir <dig> localization to nts <dig>  and vice versa  <cit> . thus, so far, two pathways have been described that lead to rdna silencing in yeast: a sir2-dependent pathway, in which fob <dig> recruits net <dig>  leading to sir <dig> association with nts <dig>  and a sir2-independent pathway, in which fob <dig> alternatively recruits tof <dig> to nts <dig>  leading to csm1/lrs <dig> recruitment.

in the present study, we explored the role of jmjc-containing demethylases in regulating heterochromatin silencing. our results show that yeast jhd <dig> demethylates histone h3k <dig> near the rdna locus and that this activity is required for sir2-independent rdna silencing. we suggest that jhd <dig> is the exclusive demethylase that regulates nucleolar organization by maintaining the association of condensin with the rfb site within the nts <dig> region during the mitotic phase of the cell cycle.

RESULTS
five yeast jmjc demethylases contribute to telomeric silencing
to investigate whether most jmjc-containing demethylases play a similar role in telomeric silencing to that of jhd <dig>  we performed silencing assays using an ade <dig> reporter gene integrated at telomere-proximal regions on the right arm of telomere v  . normally, cells expressing a wild-type  copy of ade <dig> produce white colonies, whereas those deficient in this gene appear red due to the accumulation of red pigment  <cit> . however, when the ade <dig> gene is placed at a telomere, its transcriptional state stochastically switches, which is evident by the presence of individual colonies composed of red and white sectors  <cit> . consistently, we observed that the ade <dig> reporter produced colonies composed of red and white sectors, whereas the loss of sir <dig> resulted in mostly white colonies. interestingly, we found that deletion mutants for each jmjc demethylase produced colonies with larger red sectors, indicating that the role of yeast jmjc-demethylases in regulating telomeric silencing is not restricted to jhd <dig> .figure  <dig>

to ascertain the common role of yeast jmjc demethylases in regulating telomeric silencing, we performed silencing assays in cells containing a ura3-reporter gene embedded in the telomere-proximal regions on the left arm of telomere vii  . the drug 5-fluoroorotic acid , which is converted into a lethal metabolite by active ura <dig> enzyme, was added to cells to evaluate the level of silencing. as the results for tel05r, we observed that telomeric silencing was enhanced in all deletion mutants for each jmjc-demethylase at tel07l . as previously reported, cells lacking sir <dig> or rpd <dig> repressed or enhanced telomeric silencing, respectively  <cit> . consistent with this, chromatin immunoprecipitation  analyses showed that the association of sir <dig> with telomere-proximal regions was significantly increased by the loss of each demethylase, whereas rap <dig> association was unaffected . consequently, our results show that the five jmjc-containing demethylases in yeast share common functions in the regulation of telomeric silencing.

jhd <dig> exclusively contributes to rdna silencing
in the yeast s. cerevisiae, heterochromatic-like regions under the control of sir <dig> include telomeric regions, rdna and silenced mating-type loci  <cit> . the initial observation that telomeric silencing was enhanced in cells deficient for any jmjc-demethylase led us to examine whether silencing at rdna regions and mating-type loci was affected by the loss of demethylases. to test this, we used a ura <dig> reporter integrated into the nts <dig> region of the rdna . in striking contrast with the common functions of yeast jmjc demethylases in telomeric silencing, we found that only jhd2Î” profoundly enhanced rdna silencing; the addition of foa potentiated cell growth .

to examine further whether the effect of jhd <dig> on rdna silencing was dependent on the enzymatic activity of jhd <dig>  we used a catalytically inactive mutant of jhd <dig> , which contains a mutation in the fe binding site. as reported previously, we observed that overexpression of wt jhd <dig> significantly reduced h3k4me <dig> levels, whereas overexpression of jhd2-h427a had little effect on h3k4me <dig>   <cit> . moreover, rdna silencing was significantly reduced in jhd2-overexpressing cells, but not in jhd2-h427a-overexpressing cells , indicating that the regulation of rdna silencing is completely dependent on the demethylase activity of jhd <dig>  by contrast, the growth of all jmjc-demethylase deletion mutants â€“ which contained ura <dig> reporters integrated into the hmr or hml loci â€“ was indistinguishable from that of an isogenic wt strain . in cells lacking sir <dig> or rpd <dig>  we observed repression and enhancement of silencing, respectively, at hm loci, as previously reported  <cit> . taken together, our data reveal that jhd <dig> is the only jmjc demethylase that contributes to the regulation of rdna silencing.

bivalent regulation of rdna silencing by h <dig> lysine methylases
the observation that loss of jhd <dig> exclusively enhanced rdna silencing raises several questions. if, among the five jmjc demethylases, jhd <dig> is solely responsible for rdna silencing, is the association of silencing proteins with rdna affected only by the loss of jhd2? jhd <dig> is a demethylase specific for histone h3k <dig>  thus, does set <dig>  the methylase for histone h3k <dig>  have the opposite effect on rdna silencing? if so, does set <dig> regulate silencing through the same pathway as jhd2?

to address the first question, we examined the recruitment of the rent components net <dig> and sir <dig> to the nts <dig> and nts <dig> sites of rdna using chip. the nts <dig> primer set spans the rfb site, and the nts <dig> primer set overlaps the polymerase i transcription initiation region for the 35s rrna gene . consistent with a previous report, we observed that pcr with these two primer pairs amplified two preferential localization sites for both net <dig> and sir <dig> within the nts <dig> and nts <dig> regions   <cit> . in addition, we confirmed that loss of sir <dig> did not affect the association of net <dig> with either the nts <dig> or nts <dig> region, as previously reported  <cit> . surprisingly, we found that the association of neither net <dig> nor sir <dig> with the nts regions was affected by loss of jhd <dig>  in addition, we unexpectedly observed that the association of net <dig>  but not sir <dig>  was increased up to twofold in gis1Î” cells. in silencing assays, the loss of gis <dig> had little effect on rdna silencing . these data strongly suggest that jhd <dig> functions in rdna silencing through a pathway that is independent of net <dig> and sir <dig> figure  <dig>

previously, our group and others have reported that the deletion of set <dig> impairs rdna silencing  <cit> . this observation prompted us to determine whether set1-mediated h3k <dig> methylation regulates the association of net <dig> or sir <dig> with the rdna locus. as expected, rdna silencing was impaired by an h3k4a substitution mutation . consistent with this finding, the recruitment of both net <dig> and sir <dig> to nts <dig> and nts <dig> was compromised in set1Î” cells . a set <dig> deletion was previously shown to impair rdna silencing, but this mutation caused no detectable defect in net <dig> and sir <dig> recruitment to rdna  <cit> . however, our data show that the deletion of set <dig> did reduce the recruitment of net <dig> and sir <dig> . chip analyses for h3k4a mutant cells further support the conclusion that h3k <dig> methylation is required for the association of both net <dig> and sir <dig> . similarly, defects in rdna silencing and in the association of net <dig> and sir <dig> were observed for h3k79a mutant cells, as previously reported   <cit> . in parallel, net <dig> and sir <dig> recruitment was decreased in dot1Î” cells . recently, it has been suggested that set <dig>  an h3k <dig> methylase, has an antagonistic role within heterochromatic regions; mutations in h3k <dig> or set2âˆ† cause ectopic silencing adjacent to hmra  <cit> , and the loss of set <dig> leads to increased silencing at telomeric, rdna and hmr regions  <cit> . consistent with these observations, set2Î” significantly increased net <dig> and sir <dig> recruitment to rdna . for h3k36a mutant cells, we confirmed enhanced rdna silencing and significantly increased net <dig> recruitment, but were unable to find any significant changes in sir <dig> levels . taken together, these results elucidate the different roles of histone h <dig> methylases in regulating net1/sir <dig> recruitment to rdna regions and the resultant rdna silencing. in particular, both h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> methylation by set <dig> and dot <dig> positively regulate rdna silencing, whereas h3k <dig> methylation by set <dig> has the opposite effect.

jhd <dig> and gis <dig> demethylate h3k <dig> and h3k <dig>  respectively, within rdna regions in vivo
our genetic and biochemical analyses of each gene deletion and each substitution mutant demonstrate the bivalent regulation of rdna silencing by the methylases set <dig>  dot <dig> and set <dig> through a sir2-dependent pathway. however, the observation that jhd <dig> demethylase regulates rdna silencing independently of net <dig> and sir <dig> raises the question of whether jhd <dig> demethylase activity is present within the rdna region. in addition, it remains to be determined whether the loss of gis <dig> demethylase activity leads to enhanced net <dig> recruitment to the rdna locus in gis1Î” cells. it has been argued that gis1Î” decreases the global levels of h3k36me <dig> but increases the levels of h3k36me2/ <dig> in vivo  <cit> . consistently, we found that cells lacking gis <dig> exhibited reduced levels of h3k36me <dig> and increased levels of h3k36me2/ <dig> at both nts <dig> and nts <dig> within the rdna locus in vivo . as a control, we confirmed that loss of set <dig> depleted all three states of h3k <dig> methylation in this region. moreover, overexpression of gis <dig> decreased both h3k36me <dig> and h3k36me <dig>  but it increased h3k36me <dig> . as such, these results indicate that gis <dig> affects h3k36me2/ <dig> at the rdna locus.figure  <dig>

conventionally, h3k4me <dig> is highly correlated with transcriptional activity, as it is most concentrated at the promoters and 5â€² ends of the coding regions of active genes  <cit> . at the actively transcribed pma <dig> gene, the deletion or overexpression of jhd <dig> leads to a twofold increase or decrease, respectively, in h3k4me <dig> at the promoter or orf regions of the gene  <cit> . however, it is unknown whether jhd <dig> modulates h3k <dig> methylation at the rdna region, although it has been observed that h3k <dig> methylation can be abrogated by a set1Î” or h3k4r substitution mutation at this region  <cit> . our chip analyses involving Î±-h3k4me <dig> also showed that h3k4me <dig> was repressed by set1Î” and slightly increased by jhd2Î” at both nts regions . furthermore, jhd <dig> overexpression caused a decrease in h3k4me <dig> at both nts regions, with a significantly stronger reduction at nts <dig> compared with nts <dig>  a considerable decrease in h3k4me2/ <dig> upon jhd <dig> overexpression was detected in the nts regions as well . therefore, these results support the hypothesis that jhd <dig> exerts its effects on all states of methylated h3k <dig> within the nts regions of rdna.

jhd <dig> regulates rdna silencing through a sir2-independent pathway
to establish further the role of jhd <dig> in rdna silencing, we used strains carrying an mura <dig> reporter gene integrated into one of three sites: outside the rdna array at the leu <dig> gene or inside the rdna unit at one of two loci with a strong signal for net <dig> and sir <dig> association   <cit> . unlike the mura <dig> gene outside the rdna, the mura <dig> gene inserted at either nts <dig> or nts <dig> exhibited strong silencing, which was compromised by sir2Î” in both cases, indicating that silencing at the nts regions is influenced by sir <dig>   <cit> . the enhanced silencing at nts <dig> correlated with increased enrichment of net <dig> at chromatin near nts <dig> . by contrast, cells lacking jhd <dig> displayed a profound increase in rdna silencing, predominantly at nts <dig>  consistent with the ability of jhd <dig> to modulate h3k <dig> methylation primarily at nts <dig>  moreover, the sir2Î” jhd2Î” double mutation still significantly increased rdna silencing at nts <dig> to levels seen in jhd2Î” cells and decreased silencing at nts <dig> to levels seen in sir2Î” cells. if the enhanced rdna silencing at nts <dig> caused by jhd2Î” was affected by sir <dig>  then deletion of sir <dig> should have at least partially rescued the growth defect observed in jhd2Î” cells . silencing in gis1Î” cells was indistinguishable from that in wt cells. we therefore reasoned that jhd <dig> regulates rdna silencing specifically at the nts <dig> region in a sir2-independent manner.figure  <dig>

we next examined whether proteins, such as fob <dig>  tof <dig> and csm1/lrs <dig>  are involved in regulating rdna silencing by jhd <dig>  as previously reported, the deletion of fob <dig>  tof <dig>  csm <dig> or lrs <dig> caused defects in nts1-specific rdna silencing   <cit> . intriguingly, we observed that cells containing a jhd <dig> deletion combined with an fob <dig>  tof <dig>  csm <dig> or lrs <dig> deletion grew at similar rate to fob1Î”, tof2Î”, csm1Î” or lrs4Î” cells . these results strongly suggest that jhd <dig> regulates rdna silencing through a pathway that includes fob <dig>  tof <dig> and csm1/lrs <dig> 

jhd <dig> regulates rdna recombination through a tof2/csm1/lrs <dig> pathway
in yeast, rdna silencing within the nucleolus is thought to be part of a mechanism that evolved to suppress rdna recombination among rdna repeats. this repression of genome instability delays the formation of rdna circles, the accumulation of which ultimately leads to cellular senescence  <cit> . based on the finding that loss of h3k <dig> or h3k <dig> methylation resulted in disruption of rent component recruitment to a silencing-compromised rdna locus, we tested whether loss of set <dig> or dot <dig> affects rdna recombination. to measure the rdna recombination rate, we monitored the frequency of loss of an ade <dig> marker gene integrated at the rdna locus, a technique known as the unequal sister chromatid exchange assay. as expected, we observed that the loss of set <dig> or dot <dig> led to approximately twofold increases in the rate of marker loss compared with wt cells . by contrast, ade <dig> loss was completely suppressed in cells lacking set <dig>  as a control, we confirmed that marker loss was significantly elevated in sir2Î” cells, as previously reported  <cit> . accordingly, these results demonstrate that the histone h <dig> methylases set <dig>  dot <dig> and set <dig> regulate rdna recombination, consistent with their roles in sir2-dependent rdna silencing.figure  <dig> 
jhd <dig> regulates unequal sister chromatid exchange in rdna in a sir2- independent manner.  the frequency of unequal rdna crossovers was monitored by loss of the ade <dig> gene located within the rdna array for wt  and the indicated deletion strains.  the percentage of ade <dig> gene loss  from  and  was calculated as the ratio of red-sectored colonies to the total number of colonies. completely red colonies were excluded. error bars indicate the sd from two  or three  repetitions, and asterisks indicate statistically significant differences compared with wt or between indicated pairs . wt, wild type.



considering that jhd <dig> influences rdna silencing independently of sir <dig> but does associate with a set of proteins including tof2/csm1/lrs <dig>  we next asked whether jhd <dig> regulates the rdna recombination associated with these proteins. consistent with previous reports showing that fob <dig> is required for intra- and inter-sister chromatid recombination events following double-stranded breaks at the rfb site of rdna  <cit> , we observed that the rate of rdna recombination was significantly reduced in fob1Î” cells . however, for cells lacking either csm <dig> or lrs <dig>  we observed a twofold increase in the rate of marker loss. several reports have suggested that csm1/lrs <dig> regulates the rate of rdna recombination through two possible models: csm1/lrs <dig> mediates the tethering of rdna repeats to the nuclear periphery or recruits condensin to the rfb site of rdna, either of which would help maintain the integrity of the rdna repeat . in cells lacking tof <dig>  we observed a more modest increase in marker loss than in cells lacking csm <dig> or lrs <dig>  consistent with previous reports  <cit> . collectively, these data support the idea that the proteins fob1/tof2/csm1/lrs <dig> help maintain the integrity of rdna repeats.

we next hypothesized that if jhd <dig> affects rdna recombination through a tof2/csm1/lrs <dig> pathway, loss of jhd <dig> would most likely suppress rdna recombination through enhanced rdna silencing. contrary to our expectation, deletion of jhd <dig> caused a twofold increase in the rdna recombination rate. combining jhd2Î” with sir2Î” had an additive effect on the rate of rdna recombination, whereas double mutant cells lacking jhd2Î” tof2Î”, jhd2Î” csm1Î” or jhd2Î” lrs4Î” did not show such an effect . accordingly, these results demonstrate that jhd <dig> contributes to the regulation of rdna repeat integrity in a sir2-independent manner, and they suggest that jhd <dig> affects rdna recombination through a tof2/csm1/lrs <dig> pathway.

alleviation of condensin recruitment to rdna by jhd2
a recent study showed that the rfb site within the nts <dig> region of the rdna repeats functions as a cis element for fob1-dependent recruitment of condensin to chromosomes  <cit> . the authors suggested that three proteins, tof <dig>  csm <dig> and lrs <dig>  are required for the recruitment of condensin subunits, such as smc <dig> or brn <dig>  to the rfb and that hierarchical binding of fob <dig>  tof <dig>  csm <dig>  lrs <dig> and condensin helps maintain the integrity of long rdna repeats. these findings raise the possibility that jhd <dig> regulates silencing at the rdna locus by recruiting condensin subunits. to test this hypothesis, chip was performed on asynchronous cultures of wt cells or cells lacking jhd <dig> or gis <dig>  which expressed tap-tagged fob <dig>  tof <dig>  csm <dig> or lrs <dig>  previous reports showed that the major peaks of fob <dig>  tof <dig>  csm <dig> and lrs <dig> binding overlap with nts <dig>  whereas smaller peaks were observed near nts <dig>  <cit> . similarly, we observed strong cross-linking of these four proteins at nts <dig> and weak cross-linking at nts <dig> . significantly, we found that loss of jhd <dig> caused an approximately twofold increase in the association of tof2/csm1/lrs <dig>  but not fob <dig>  with the nts regions, with greater concentrations of these proteins at nts <dig> than at nts <dig>  furthermore, we found that the jhd <dig> mutation significantly increased the recruitment of smc <dig> and brn <dig> to the nts regions, similar to the increase in tof2/csm1/lrs <dig> recruitment . in gis1Î” cells, the cross-linking of fob <dig>  tof <dig> and smc <dig> remained unchanged, whereas that of csm <dig>  lrs <dig> and brn <dig> was elevated at both nts regions. taken together, our results show that loss of jhd <dig> significantly elevated the association of condensin subunits, tof <dig> and csm1/lrs <dig> with nts regions, and they strongly suggest that h3k <dig> demethylation by jhd <dig> is a critical step in maintaining proper condensin association following fob <dig> recruitment to the nts <dig> region of rdna repeats.figure  <dig>

jhd <dig> regulates mitotic rdna condensation
finally, we reasoned that if jhd <dig> regulates rdna silencing by affecting condensin recruitment, then the deletion or overexpression of jhd <dig> should affect mitotic chromatin packaging, also referred to as mitotic rdna condensation. to evaluate the input of jhd <dig> in the establishment of mitotic chromatin changes, we monitored rdna condensation in nocodazole-arrested cells by fluorescent in situ hybridization   <cit> . we measured the ratio of the rdna fish signal from a probe against the highly repetitive rdna array relative to total nuclear volume as an indication of nucleolar organization   <cit> . we observed no differences in the relative rdna decondensation ratio between wt and gis <dig> mutant cells; however, the deletion of jhd <dig> led to a more compact or hypercondensed rdna morphology and a significant twofold decrease in the decondensation ratio compared with wt . approximately 77% of cells lacking jhd <dig> contained hypercondensed rdna . moreover, overexpression of jhd <dig>  but not gis <dig>  caused the rdna to adopt an amorphous distribution, which was reflected by an increase in the decondensation ratio up to  <dig> -fold, whereas jhd2-h427a, a catalytically inactive mutant of jhd <dig>  had little effect on rdna decondensation . approximately 52% of cells overexpressing jhd <dig> contained decondensed rdna . in particular, cell population analysis revealed that approximately  <dig> % of jhd2-deficient or -overexpressing cells showed two separable rdna bodies, whereas the majority  of jhd2Î” cells showed hypercondensed rdna that was separated from the nuclear periphery . therefore, our fish analyses demonstrate that histone h3k <dig> demethylation by jhd <dig> regulates chromosome condensation at the rdna locus during mitosis, and they suggest that jhd <dig> is required for the sequestration of rdna in the peripherally located nucleolus, a process that ensures rdna repeat stability.figure  <dig>

discussion
the results presented here illustrate the distinct role of histone h <dig> demethylation in regulating rdna recombination and nucleolar silencing in yeast. based on the results obtained in this study and other previous reports, we propose a model in which jhd <dig> regulates rdna silencing by maintaining proper condensin association with rdna repeats, which contributes to faithful mitotic chromosome segregation . during interphase and mitosis, the rent components net <dig> and sir <dig> colocalize to a subdomain within the nucleolus, particularly to the nts <dig> and nts <dig> rdna regions; however, at the end of mitosis, sir <dig> leaves the nucleolus and disperses throughout the nucleus  <cit> . the methylation of h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> by set <dig> and dot <dig>  as well as the methylation of h3k <dig> by set <dig>  act as bivalent markers that affect net1/sir <dig> recruitment to both the nts <dig> and nts <dig> regions. the association of net1/sir <dig> with nts <dig> depends on fob <dig>  but how net1/sir <dig> associates with nts <dig> is still unknown. changes in net1/sir <dig> recruitment to rdna regulated by bivalent histone methylation may contribute to restricted nucleolar silencing, a paradoxical silencing of rdna transcription in which silenced chromatin structures in the nucleolus allow for highly active transcription by rna polymerase i  <cit> . in this context, it seems likely that rdna packaging could dynamically shift between a set1- or dot1-engaged silenced structure and a set2-engaged active structure accessible to rna polymerase i. during mitosis, however, nucleolar silencing is likely to be primarily regulated by jhd <dig>  a histone h3k <dig> demethylase, in a net1- or sir2-independent manner. the yeast condensin localizes throughout the genome during interphase but becomes concentrated in the nucleolus during mitosis  <cit> , and the rfb site within the nts <dig> region functions as a cis element for fob1-dependent condensin recruitment onto chromatin  <cit> . demethylation of h3k <dig> by jhd <dig>  which occurs within a region of nts <dig> that spans the rfb site, suppresses fob1-mediated hierarchical binding of tof <dig>  csm <dig> and lrs <dig> to the rfb site, thereby limiting the excessive recruitment of condensin. this alleviation of condensin recruitment to the nts <dig> region by jhd <dig> is thought to ensure the proper condensin levels necessary to facilitate the higher-order structure of mitotic chromosomes, leading to faithful sister chromatid separation during anaphase. the prevention of excessive condensin recruitment to nts <dig> by jhd <dig> also contributes to nucleolar restriction during mitosis by allowing for less condensation of the chromatin in the nucleolus. consistent with our model, the rrna genes within the nucleoli of most mammalian cells contain more than 50% active nors  <cit> , which remain under-condensed during mitosis with a distinct decondensed chromatin structure  <cit> .figure  <dig>

previously, it was reported that chromosomal regions harboring rdna repeats are preferentially sequestered at the nuclear periphery away from the bulk dna in yeast; however, deletion of lrs <dig> or heh <dig>  a chromosome linkage inner nuclear membrane protein, caused the rdna to adopt an amorphous distribution and reduced perinuclear rdna positioning with a small percentage of cells showing two separable rdna bodies  <cit> . similarly, we observed that approximately  <dig> % of jhd2-deficient or -overexpressing cells showed two separable rdna bodies and the majority of the hypercondensed rdna in jhd2Î” cells was mislocalized away from the nuclear periphery . the presence of two separable rdna bodies may reflect a strong loss of interactions between rdna repeats on chromosome xii sister chromatids, as previously postulated in cells deficient for lrs <dig>  csm <dig> or heh <dig>  <cit> . in addition, a loss of rdna sequestration in the peripherally located nucleolus in jhd2Î” cells is likely correlated with increased instability of the rdna repeats, as a similar correlation was reported for lrs4Î” and heh1Î” cells  <cit> . this phenomenon could also explain the discrepancy between the increased rdna silencing and the elevated rdna recombination observed in jhd2Î” cells . for example, the increased csm1/lrs <dig> recruitment to the nts <dig> region of the rdna repeats in jhd2Î” cells could increase csm1/lrs4-dependent rdna clustering to promote rdna silencing, while simultaneously disrupting the stoichiometry of csm1/lrs4-dependent perinuclear rdna anchoring, leading to mislocalization of rdna at the nuclear periphery and increased rdna instability. in contrast with the additive effect observed in the jhd2Î” sir2Î” double mutant, combinations of jhd2Î” with csm1Î” or lrs4Î” were indistinguishable from jhd2Î” alone, supporting the idea that the function of jhd <dig> in regulating rdna recombination is linked to that of csm <dig> and lrs <dig> .

recently, csm1/lrs <dig> proteins were shown to maintain replicative lifespan by regulating both rdna repeats and telomeres  <cit> . at telomeric regions, the csm1/lrs <dig> proteins link inner nuclear proteins to chromosome ends, an interaction that requires the sir proteins. interestingly, the authors showed that deletion of fob <dig>  which recruits csm1/lrs <dig> to rdna, increased the association of lrs <dig> with dna sequences  <dig> Â kb away from the telomeres, and they suggested that lrs <dig> proteins released from rdna relocate to available sites away from the telomeres. this model raises the possibility that the increased csm1/lrs <dig> recruitment to rdna observed in jhd2Î” cells is an indirect effect of the release of a pool of csm1/lrs <dig> proteins from telomeres. if the increase in csm1/lrs <dig> association at rdna regions in jhd2Î” cells is caused by the relocation of these proteins away from telomeres, a similar decrease in both sir <dig> association and telomeric silencing, as seen in lrs4Î” cells, would be expected  <cit> . however, our group and liang et al. observed that the loss of jhd <dig> significantly enhanced telomeric silencing and increased recruitment of sir <dig> proteins to telomere-proximal regions   <cit> . as such, it is unlikely that loss of jhd <dig> caused a relocation of csm1/lrs <dig> proteins between the two silent chromatin domains.

it could be argued that set <dig> opposes jhd <dig> in regulating condensin recruitment to rdna during mitosis based on the observation that overexpression of jhd <dig> partially decreased all states of h3k <dig> methylation at the nts regions of rdna . however, we believe that the ability of jhd <dig> to modulate condensin recruitment is more likely to be distinct from that of set <dig>  as only h3k4me <dig> was significantly reduced, whereas h3k4me <dig> and h3k4me <dig> were only slightly affected by overexpression of jhd <dig> . consistent with this idea, it was reported that h3k4me <dig> is enriched across most rdna repeats, although this modification is increased 5- to 6-fold in sir2Î” cells, primarily at the nts <dig> region  <cit> . our results show that the increased rdna silencing in jhd2Î” cells was independent of sir <dig> and was only observed within the nts <dig> but not the nts <dig> region . therefore, a plausible explanation for these observations is that set1-mediated h3k <dig> methylation is likely associated with rdna silencing in a sir2-dependent manner at both the nts <dig> and nts <dig> regions, whereas jhd2-mediated h3k <dig> demethylation regulates rdna silencing independently of sir <dig> at the nts <dig> region.

high-resolution mass spectrometry analyses suggested that gis <dig> demethylates histone h3k36me2/ <dig>  <cit> . similarly, we observed that gis <dig> has in vivo h3k36me2/ <dig> demethylase activity at rdna loci . however, we found no evidence that gis <dig> activity influences rdna silencing. two jmjc demethylases, rph <dig> and gis <dig>  have been reported to regulate the expression of phr <dig>  a photolyase gene required for the light-dependent repair of pyrimidine dimers. both demethylases contain two zinc fingers and are damage-responsive repressors of phr <dig>  <cit> . in other examples, gis <dig> was suggested to act as a transcription factor regulating chronological lifespan; calorie restriction-dependent lifespan extension is mediated by the down-regulation of both the ras and tor-sch <dig> pathways and the resulting activation of the rim15-controlled msn2/ <dig> and gis <dig>  the activation of gis <dig> then induces a variety of genes involved in g <dig> entry and the stress response . it remains to be determined whether the role of gis <dig> in regulating net <dig> association with rdna loci  is linked to the function of gis <dig> as a transcriptional repressor or activator. a previous report that the localization of net <dig> to the nts <dig> region may be due to its physical association with rna polymerase i  <cit> , raising the possibility that gis <dig>  at least in part, negatively regulates net <dig> recruitment to the nts <dig> region, presumably as a transcriptional repressor of rna polymerase i. in addition, we do not dismiss the possibility that gis <dig> may assist the jhd2-mediated recruitment of condensin to rdna, as we detected a considerable increase in the recruitment of csm <dig>  lrs <dig> and brn <dig> in gis1Î” cells .

in vertebrate cells, there are two types of condensin complexes, condensin i and ii  <cit> . these two complexes share two core subunits, cap-e/smc <dig> and cap-c/smc <dig>  which belong to the structural maintenance of chromosomes  protein family; the complexes also contain three alternative non-smc regulatory subunits, the kleisin subunit and two heat repeat-containing subunits . in s. cerevisiae, the condensin complex is composed of five subunits: two core smc subunits, smc <dig> and smc <dig>  and three non-smc subunits, brn <dig>  and ycs4/ycs <dig>  .

as the smc proteins are highly conserved from yeast to humans and jhd <dig> is an evolutionarily conserved mammalian jarid <dig> family protein targeting histone h3k <dig>  the regulation of rdna condensation in mitosis by h3k <dig> demethylation is most likely conserved among eukaryotes.

CONCLUSIONS
nucleolar rdna is tightly associated with heterochromatin. however, paradoxically, the compact structure of rdna still allows for highly active transcription. in the present study, we show that rdna packaging is dynamically regulated by changes in histone h <dig> lysine methylation levels between a set1- or dot1-engaged silenced structure and a set2-engaged active structure accessible to rna polymerase i, thereby affecting rdna silencing and recombination between the rdna repeats. during mitosis in particular, we found that the prevention of excessive condensin association within the nts <dig> region by the jhd <dig> demethylase contributes to the proper condensin level to facilitate the higher-order structure of mitotic chromosomes. the dynamic epigenetic changes in histone h <dig> methylation levels by histone h <dig> lysine methyltransferases and demethylases in the regulation of rdna silencing provide a mechanistic insight regarding how restricted silencing within the nucleolus contributes to faithful chromosome segregation, as well as to cellular senescence during the progression of the cell cycle.
