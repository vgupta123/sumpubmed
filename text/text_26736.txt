BACKGROUND
it has been well-recognized that within a cell, not only genes participate in cascades of biochemical events , but also the pathways themselves cross-talk with each other as a delicate and intriguing network system. such complexity was reflected in the normal biological processes  as well as in the complex disease processes such as autism, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and coronary artery disease  <cit> . in addition, the genetic interactions of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes may perturb the normal network system through a variety of altered molecular properties of the normal genes, magnifying the difficulties encountered in the cancer biology study  <cit> . because of this, it is important to develop quantitative molecular models which can represent different physiological or pathological states of a complex biological system and can be used to predict the related states, using high throughput molecular data. in line with this viewpoint, we argue for the priority to construct models for the normal physiological states first. this is because  normal cells/tissues are endowed with the most stable biochemical homeostasis and  such models may serve as general references for contrasting with various pathological or altered physiological states.

up to now, in part due to the limitation in sample availability, few studies on normal human tissues have been reported. through the transcriptome study of the disease-free human samples via microarray analysis, gross patterns of tissue-gene relationships have been observed by several teams  <cit> . a recent study which applied statistical and network analysis to transcriptomic data from  <dig> normal human tissue types has resulted in putative tissue-specific networks for nine tissues. these putative tissue-specific networks were suggested as potential drug targets  <cit> . however, it still awaits a deeper investigation to find out what molecular signatures can best represent the normal state of a specific tissue and offer the most transparent and systematic elucidation on tissue differences . in this study, by re-analyzing some of the transcriptomic datasets produced from normal human tissues in the gene expression omnibus , we identified a set of  <dig> genes whose transcript profiles are endowed with strong tissue-specific properties for  <dig> different tissue types under the disease-free condition. these genes present significant variation of expression amongst tissues. from the expression level of these  <dig> genes, we constructed  <dig> tissue-specific gene expression templates , one for each of the  <dig> tissues. we first validated that these gets can differentiate tissue types under the normal physiological condition. then we demonstrated how get can be applied under other conditions, including development and cancerous conditions. our results suggest that homeostasis among various molecules in a cell/tissue may play a key role in maintaining its normal functioning and the homeostasis state can be characterized by the  <dig> genes.

RESULTS
characterization of  <dig> tissue types by the  <dig> genes
we searched for a set of genes whose expression profile could best represent normal state of a specific tissue type. we used three large-scale microarray datasets as our training datasets to identify a group of  <dig> genes with high variation in expression across different tissue types . briefly, we selected the probe sets with coefficient of variation  ranked within the top  <dig> % of the entire transcriptome across all samples from each of the three training datasets. after intersecting the three groups of highly variably expressed probe sets, we removed redundant probe sets that share similar expression patterns. our procedure yielded a set of  <dig> genes. .

function enrichment analysis, based on an ontology search against the panther database, showed that these  <dig> genes were most enriched in encoding cytoskeletal proteins, calmodulin-related proteins, and neuropeptides . gene ontology search indicated that the proteins encoded by the  <dig> genes were mostly localized to extracellular regions  and were involved in the processes of response to wounding , response to steroid hormone stimulus  and regulation of homeostatic process . while searching kegg for the pathways mapped by the  <dig> genes, we found focal adhesion, ecm-receptor interaction, and ppar signaling pathway over-represented.  we conducted hierarchical clustering with the  <dig> genes from the  <dig> tissue types shared by our three training datasets. the result showed that all of the  <dig> tissues were well grouped . to confirm that the tissue-clustering result is specific to the gene set we identified, we randomly-selected  <dig> probe sets and applied the same hierarchical clustering analysis to their expression profiles. we were no longer able to find the tissue clusters; instead, the only visible clusters were three large classes corresponding to tissues from each data source.  in addition, as suggested by one anonymous reviewer, we also selected the probes with the highest expression level across all tissues as a contrast group. this contrast group of genes  failed to group tissues properly. 

taking a closer look at the outcome of the tissue classification obtained from the hierarchical clustering analysis, similar to the previous reports published by shyamsundar et al  <cit>  and ge et al  <cit>  on tissue classification, our results also showed that the tissues were grouped largely by their physiological functions, anatomical locations or cellular composition. for example, ovary and uterus, the organs from the female productive system, were clustered together; the gland tissues/organs including thyroid, pancreas, and salivary gland also aggregated and the testis as previously reported  <cit>  was grouped with the tissues from the central nervous system like cerebellum, amygdala, and thalamus. however, it should be noted that we obtained the similar tissue classification result with far smaller set of genes  as the classifiers, in comparison with the two previous reports where they used  <dig>  <cit>  genes and  <dig>  <cit>  genes on  <dig> tissue types  and  <dig> tissue types , respectively.

accurate prediction of normal tissues
we speculated that the expression profile of this compact 56-gene set might represent a set of important molecular features for tissue specification under normal conditions. to determine whether this gene set could accurately predict the tissue type of a sample of unknown origin, the expression profiles of the  <dig> genes from the  <dig> tissues were extracted from our three microarray datasets to form the tissue-specific gene expression templates  for tissue prediction. more precisely, for each of the  <dig> tissues, we obtained a get which consisted of the average of the probe values of the three datasets for the  <dig> selected genes. to predict the tissue type of a new sample, we compared the expression pattern of the  <dig> genes in the new sample with each of the  <dig> gets by calculating their correlation coefficients . the tissue type of the get showing the highest degree of similarity as measured by c.f. is our prediction. as an example, we took a new dataset from gene expression omnibus, gse <dig> <cit> , which contained data derived from human liver, lung, and thyroid, in non-malignant and malignant conditions. tissue prediction was performed by calculating the correlation between the expressions of the  <dig> genes in each test tissue against each of our  <dig> gets. for the non-malignant tissues, we obtained 100% correct prediction, strongly endorsing our speculation that the expression profiles of the  <dig> genes may be used as molecular signatures for normal human tissues.  to further validate the use of these tissue-specific gets as predictors of normal human tissues, an extensive tissue-prediction analysis was carried out on a total of  <dig> microarray datasets consisting of  <dig> samples from  <dig> different human tissues. these datasets were obtained by searching the entire geo database using two criteria:  the tissue types must fall into the category of the claimed  <dig> distinguishable normal human tissues  they were hybridized on one of two affymetrix genechips, hg-u133a  or hg-u133plus <dig>  . cell lines or specific cell types from an organ were excluded . as it turned out, the overall prediction accuracy of our method already reached  <dig> % . . this large-scale validation demonstrated that the tissue-specific profiles of the  <dig> genes are essential for the  <dig> human tissue types. it also suggests that the tissue-specific gets very likely represent the overall biochemical equilibrium reached by all the molecules of a tissue under normal physiological condition.

correctly predicted: the number of tested samples for which the tissue source was correctly predicted. the source data as well as the analysis results from each dataset can be found at the additional file 1: table s <dig> 

to show how stable and robust the relative expression level of the  <dig> genes is, we used spearman's rank correlation to replace the standard pearson correlation in the tissue-prediction analysis and obtained  <dig> %  of accuracy . it indicates that the relative expression of the  <dig> genes is a robust feature for characterizing the normal state of a specific human tissue.

so far, we have chosen affymetrix as the gene expression platform to test the performance of get. our reasons are  affymetrix is the common platform used in our three training datasets which ensures the inclusion of the entire set of our  <dig> genes;  the data preprocessing procedure is standardized;  existence of many datasets in the public domain for validation and  high reproducibility. however, it remains questionable whether get can be applied to other platforms of measuring gene expression or not. to address this issue, we searched geo for datasets containing enough samples from norm human tissues. we found an abi array generated dataset, gse <dig>  <cit> , which contains many normal human tissue samples. among them, there are  <dig> samples  matching our  <dig> tissue types. we treated the data generated by these abi array as if they were from the affymetrix and applied get to make tissue prediction. strikingly, we found that our affymetrix-based gets yield a perfect result, 100%  . this demonstrates that get is platform-independent.

network analysis reveals involvement of the  <dig> genes in development and tumorigenesis
the above results indicate that these tissue-specific gets may be more than simply a set of biomarkers capable of distinguishing different tissue types. their profiles may represent a "net sum" of the interplays among the complex gene regulation pathways occurring in a tissue. we explored the possible biological roles of the  <dig> genes by performing network analysis using the commercial tool metacore from genego inc. which builds gene networks based on molecular interactions acquired from experiments-based literature reports  <cit> . we firstly applied the basic algorithm "analyze networks" to our  <dig> genes using the default parameter settings. the top scored results  showed mmp <dig> , stat <dig> , and pparg  to be the most connected molecules in the network  with  <dig> of our genes included. mmp <dig> has been known to be the key regulator for bone remodeling  <cit> , stat <dig> is involved in embryogenesis, hematopoietic cell development and is a biomarker for embryo stem cells <cit> , and pparg is involved in the regulation of neural stem cells proliferation and differentiation  <cit> . we then applied the algorithm "receptor targets modeling" which allows users to identify the important transcription factors  connected to the query genes and the signaling receptors associated with these tfs". the best result produced by this algorithm delivered a network   with half  of our genes connected to the tfs: stat <dig>  esr, srf, cebpb, e2f <dig>  pparg and tp <dig> and these transcription factors were regulated by egfr. all of these molecules are known to be important in development and/or tumorigenesis. for example, esr , a ligand-activated transcription factor, is essential for sexual development and reproductive function, and is involved in breast cancer, endometrial cancer, and osteoporosis. the signature genes linked to esr include abat, cd <dig>  gja, krt <dig>  msmb, pcp <dig> tf and thbs, among which cd <dig> and thbs were responsive to hypoxia, and cd <dig>  gja, krt <dig> were involved in development of immune system, neuron projection and ectoderm, respectively. srf , the transcription factor which regulates the activity of many immediate-early genes, such as c-fos, has been known to participate in numerous significant processes like cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and cell differentiation. it is the downstream target of many pathways including the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway  and is implicated in the hepatoma progression  <cit> . among the four signature genes linked to srf, gro <dig> is a chemokine and an oncoprotein, desmin an intermediate filament involved in muscle contraction and cytoskeleton organization, dlk a transmembrane protein is implicated in development of numerous cell types such as adipocytes, skeletal and neural systems and mlc <dig> is a myosin component involved in development of heart and muscle. the receptor directly connected to the majority of these tfs was egfr, a tyrosine kinase coupled receptor known to be tightly associated with several cancers when overexpressed  <cit> .

detection of developmental stages in cultured cells and embryonic tissue
as the network analysis above suggests possible roles of the  <dig> genes in tissue development and tumorigenesis, we intended to test whether the degree of similarity to our gets may also reflect the physiological or developmental states of a given tissue. to proceed, we were able to obtain datasets for two embryonic tissues, skin and lung, from geo.

first we calculated the c.f. between our skin get and the  <dig> gene expressions from each array of the dataset gse <dig>  <cit>  where nhek epidermal progenitor cells had been treated with 2--pyrrolopyrimidine  for different periods of time. pp- <dig> can induce terminal differentiation of epidermal progenitor cells to keratinocytes. we found that the degree of similarity to adult skin as measured by correlation did increase with the duration of pp- <dig> induction : the slope of the regression line was  <dig>  with p value of t-test being  <dig> × 10- <dig> 

the other dataset, gse <dig>  <cit> , contained transcriptomic data derived from human embryonic lungs of ages ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> days post conception. we calculated the c.f.s of our adult lung get and the 56-gene profiles of these fetal lungs. again, we found an increasing trend with developmental stages . this suggests that during the developmental process, gene expression in the embryonic cells gradually progresses toward the terminal equilibrium represented by the 56-gene profiles in the target adult tissues. the fluctuation observed in the correlation across developmental times may be caused by genetic variation or different pathological states among the donors.

to confirm that this trend was specific to the lung template only, not other tissue templates, we also performed the same correlation computation with each of the remaining  <dig> training tissues and calculated the regression coefficients of all correlation plots . the result agreed with our main finding that lung gave the highest regression coefficient among the twenty-four tissues.

deviation of normal expression profiles from cancerous tissue
relationship of our normal-tissue derived gets to gene expression of the cancerous tissues was firstly studied on the dataset gse <dig> which contained transcriptomic data from cancerous tissues. correct tissue prediction was between 33%-97%  and the c.f. to their corresponding tissues  <dig> ~ <dig> , both significantly lower than their paired normal parts. the decrease of prediction accuracy on cancerous tissues  might reflect the increasingly heterogeneous nature of cancerous cells in a specimen. we applied the same tissue-prediction analysis to the transcriptomic data gse <dig>  <cit>  from nci <dig> cancer cell lines with a homogeneous progressing cell population. as expected, this analysis led to relatively poor prediction , suggesting that the overall biochemical reactions in these cancerous cells may have become very different from those in a normal tissue. however, the significantly lower prediction accuracy using cell lines rather than cancerous tissues  could be due to the intrinsic differences between these two systems.

a tissue prediction was as described in methods by comparing the c.f. between the 56-gene profiles of the test against each of our  <dig> training tissues.

b the c.f. exhibited here is that between the 56-gene profiles of the test and the corresponding normal tissue in our training set.

to further test whether our gets would be capable of differentiating benign from malignant tumors, we analyzed dataset gse <dig>  <cit> , from a melanoma study that had been extensively examined by various techniques. melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer, and its diagnosis is challenging even for seasoned pathologists. we found, in terms of both precision of tissue prediction and of correlation with our skin get that the expression profiles of the 56-gene sets in most  of the malignant tumors strongly deviated from those in either normal skin or benign nevus. in short, we obtained 96% sensitivity and 89% specificity in distinguishing melanoma from normal skin tissue or benign skin tumor using the 56-gene profiles . this result further supports our hypothesis that the combinatorial expression profile of the  <dig> genes accurately reflects the physiological state of a tissue. it also suggests that these 56-gene profiles could be used to facilitate diagnosis and as a sensitive research tool in cancer.

distinguishing normal skin from skin substitutes
there is a potential application of our system in quality assessment in tissue engineering. to illustrate the concept, whether our  <dig> gets can also characterize the normal state of the corresponding tissues. to answer the question, we used the dataset gse <dig>  <cit> , which was originally produced to investigate the molecular differences between normal human skin  and cultured skin substitutes  in order to improve css for skin autograft in patients with massive skin loss caused by burn injury. the dataset investigated the whole-genome transcriptomes under four conditions: those in normal human skin , in cultured skin substitutes , in fibroblasts  and keratinocytes . cf and ck were used to prepare css. we computed the correlation of the 56-gene expression profiles between our skin get and each sample in gse <dig>  the nhs showed the highest correlation, followed by the css. cf and ck, the two constituent cells of css, were significantly lower than either of nhs and css . this is a good reflection of the actual degree of similarity to normal skin.

discussion
we have attempted to address the fundamental issue of "can the normal physiological states of various human tissue types be quantified at the molecular level faithfully and succinctly?" in the biomedical literature, the phrase "normal physiological state" is often brought up to contrast the phrase "pathological or disease state". in physics or engineering, a "state" of a system must be quantified by well-defined variables. can we do the same in the biological world? we conceptualized the issue by arguing that one way to describe a biological state at the molecular level is to present a template consisting of  a list of molecule species and  their relative abundance levels. to be useful, three properties should be possessed- compactness, repeatability and discrimination ability. the list should be reasonably short and the template should be able to predict the state accurately for as many sets of data generated by as many different labs as possible. taking full advantage of the rich data resource provided by geo , here we offered the characterization of normal physiological state a bench mark solution.

this report is the first to present a multi-purposed, molecule-based molecular model that can characterize as many as  <dig> different human tissue types. the success of our tissue-specific gets in accurately predicting the tissue types from various sources and in discriminating tissues/cells at different developmental stages indicates that  a tissue under the disease-free condition constantly maintains certain stoichiometry among many gene products;  the same tissue type from different disease-free individuals shares very similar gene-product stoichiometry;  the gene-product stoichiometry can be expressed as the relative transcription levels of a set of representative genes, a gene expression template  ;  when the physiological or developmental state of a cell shifts, the gene-product stoichiometry may change accordingly. 

severe alteration from the normal state gene-product stoichiometry, possibly caused by multiple mutations in genes or dramatic shifts of the overall biochemical environment of a cell, may lead to abnormal growth like cancer, if not death of a cell. in support of this notion, we also demonstrated that the 56-gene expression patterns in cancerous cells/tissues significantly deviate from normal get and that our tissue-specific gets can be used to discern melanoma from benign nevi and from normal skin. potential applications of our results to tissue engineering, cancer diagnosis and development studies are therefore inferred.

our approach to constructing a gene signature for predicting tissue types is simpler than existing classification methods  <cit> . we first identified those genes showing a similar and reproducible trend in all three large datasets, then used the full gene group to perform tissue classification, and finally applied the group behavior  as predictors to characterize tissue types under various conditions. without complicated modeling, our 56-gene signature provides high prediction power on numerous public datasets. as far as we are aware of, this is the most compact gene set capable of classifying the largest number of tissues. the use of multiple datasets which served as biological replicates allowed us to reduce the number of false positives and to find the genes with most variable expression across various tissues with better confidence. note, however, that because of the high accuracy already achieved by the  <dig> genes, we did not explore the issue of possible existence of other gene sets that could serve as gets and accomplish the same or even better rate of prediction - perhaps with aids of additional statistical tools such as one-way anova for gene selection.

with the abundance of interplaying gene and pathway activities in a tissue, one may ask how the group behavior of these  <dig> genes can represent the states of various human tissue types. our functional study of the  <dig> genes reveals a variety of functional categories including cytoskeleton , signal transduction proteins , neural transmitter regulator , energy homeostasis regulator , and immunity  etc. it should be emphasized, however, that the high precision of large-scale validation on tissue prediction was not achieved through the combinatorial on/off states of a collection of tissue-specific markers because only  <dig> of the  <dig> genes appeared as tissue-specific genes which highly express in one particular tissue but minimally in others. they are tfpi <dig> specific for placenta, ankrd <dig> for testis, ela2a for pancreas and apoc <dig> for liver. however, the expressions of all  <dig> genes together as a template, did present distinctive patterns varying from tissue to tissue. therefore, this gene set may be considered as the representative genes of the key biochemical pathways functioning distinctively across tissues, and the combinatorial transcription levels of the  <dig> genes, the gets, may reflect the net sum of the relative activities of these pathways.

despite that the feature of tissue-characterization of the  <dig> genes may not be exerted through collection of the so-called "tissue-specific" genes as discussed above, it would be interesting to find out how each of the  <dig> genes may contribute to tissue characterization. one of our on-going projects in reducing the gene set without compromising its power in defining the normal physiological state of a specified human tissue may help to answer this question.

the network analysis provided additional clues to the biological implications of the signature in development and carcinogenesis. positive correlation of the 56- gene profile to developmental stages revealed in both in vitro and in vivo studies indicates that systematic shifts of the global gene expression through the complicated developmental process can be characterized with our signature genes. hence it is possible that the  <dig> genes may be good candidates for modeling the human developmental process. further, the capability of the 56- gene profiles in correlating quality of the engineered skin to the similarities to normal skin template brought up a potential application of the signature to serve as the quality index for engineered tissue.

the network analysis also helped to link our model to the current understanding of tumorigenesis. we showed that the c.f.s of the 56-gene profiles in malignant tumors were significantly lower than the normal tissues to the corresponding template, indicating changes of expression in multiple genes in a cancer tissue. it coincides with the findings that at least 4- <dig> mutations are required to initiate tumor  <cit> . in our network analysis, more than half of the  <dig> genes were found to interact with those well-known cancer-related transcription factors or signaling receptors such as stat <dig>  tp <dig>  esr <dig> and egfr which have been shown to interact with a great number of gene products involved in varieties of pathways. therefore, it is possible that mutations occurring in such genes  may simultaneously affect expression of a number of the target genes which may ultimately lead to changes in the profile of our signature. further, significant change in the profile of the  <dig> genes indicates alterations in relative activities of the pathways represented by these signature genes, reflecting a dramatic shift of the cellular homeostasis which may lead to cell necrosis or anomalous growth like tumorigenesis. alternatively, accumulated mutations in the genes which affect the activities of those pathways represented by our signature may also affect the expression profile in one hand and lead to similar outcome as described above on the other hand. taken together, despite that severe shift of the 56-gene profile from normal may not be the initial cause of many cancers, it could have the potential to serve as an indicator for the cancerous state of a cell/tissue. whether our signature can be applied to cancer staging awaits further investigation. nonetheless, this knowledge provides a new aspect in understanding the complex process of carcinogenesis.

CONCLUSIONS
these results strongly suggest that a normal tissue or cell may uphold its normal morphology and functioning by maintaining specific chemical stoichiometry among genes. the stoichiometry of a physiological state of a normal human tissue can be depicted by the relative expression levels of a compact set of representative genes such as the  <dig> genes obtained here. a significant deviation from such quantitative relationship may result in malfunction or abnormal growth of the cells.
