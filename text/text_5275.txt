BACKGROUND
perennial ryegrass is a diploid out-breeding species with a strong self-incompatibility system. major agronomic traits for this species such as forage quality are quantitatively inherited  <cit> . molecular  markers have recently become available and employed to study different characters including vernalisation response  <cit> , forage quality  <cit> , and disease resistances  <cit> .

qtl mapping has been demonstrated as a successful method to dissect the genetic bases of complex traits in several important crops since the 1990s. however, due to its self-incompatibility, populations of doubled haploid lines  or recombinant inbred lines  favorable for qtl mapping in other crops are difficult to develop in ryegrass. therefore, populations for qtl mapping in ryegrass are mainly pseudo-f <dig> populations derived from heterozygous parents  <cit> . thus, each polymorphic locus might segregate for more than two and up to four alleles. consequently, a large population size is required for reliable and high resolution qtl detection. association studies based on linkage disequilibrium  mapping could be an alternative and more efficient way for qtl/gene tagging in ryegrass. the high degree of genetic variation between and within ryegrass populations might be beneficial for identification of both genes and polymorphisms affecting quantitative inherited characters for development of informative "functional markers"  <cit> .

ld is the non-independence of alleles, based on non-random allelic association at different loci, and is proportional to the recombination fraction. ld and association studies have been performed in plants recently . many factors affect ld including mating patterns, genetic drift, population admixture, selection, and mutations. several measures were used for ld estimation  <cit> . standardized disequilibrium coefficients   <cit>  and squared allele-frequency correlations   <cit>  for pairs of loci are the preferred measures of ld. d' is only affected by recombination rate, whereas r <dig> is also affected by differences in the allele frequency at the two sites.

in coalescent simulations, high levels of selfing greatly increase levels of ld  <cit> . in out-crossing species, ld will often decay within  <dig> bp, but for highly autogamous species ld may exceed  <dig> kb. however, different gene regions exhibit very different structures of ld even within the same species. in maize, rapid ld decay was observed within  <dig> bp at d <dig>  id <dig>  tb <dig>  and sh <dig>  whereas at su <dig> ld extended to  <dig> kb  <cit> . high levels of ld were observed among single nucleotide polymorphisms  up to  <dig> kb in a region surrounding the y <dig> gene  <cit>  and a  <dig> kb region around the sdh <dig> gene  <cit> . the structure of ld can be locus specific due to varied recombination and mutation rates or natural selection pressure, but is also highly population-specific  <cit> . generally low levels of ld are expected in ryegrass due to its out-crossing and heterozygous nature. the only report on the structure of ld in ryegrass  <cit>  has been performed at a genome-wide scale using genetic markers. in ryegrass, ld has so far not been analyzed for candidate genes.

dna sequence mutations, especially snps, can either directly determine a phenotype or be closely associated with a phenotype as a result of linkage disequilibrium  <cit> . moreover, snps have been widely surveyed in several species to address evolutionary questions  <cit> . resistance genes are very abundant in plant genomes and the majority belongs to clustered gene families. so far, sequence diversity of resistance genes has mainly been studied in arabidopsis  <cit> . in this study, we sequenced about  <dig> kb regions of  <dig> expressed disease resistance candidate genes from  <dig> heterozygous genotypes  employed in the eu project grasp  <cit> . the goal in grasp was to perform snp assays for candidate gene allele tracing in selection experiments. the objectives of this study were to  identify snps for allele tracing in grasp within about  <dig> kb fragments of expressed resistance candidate genes,  compare the nucleotide diversity within and between different resistance candidate genes,  determine the extent and structure of ld within these genes, and  discuss the prospects of candidate-gene based association mapping in ryegrass.

RESULTS
haplotypes and homozygosity
 <dig> primer pairs were used to amplify  <dig> candidate gene fragments with sizes of  <dig> to  <dig> bp . the  <dig> genes included  <dig> nbs-lrr like genes,  <dig> pkpa genes,  <dig> mapk gene,  <dig> edr, and  <dig> pr gene. the sequenced fragments of three candidate genes  contained exclusively coding regions. all other genes included intron sequences in addition. a total of  <dig>  bp were aligned over all loci for the  <dig> genotypes, the length of sequence alignment for each gene was about  <dig> kb , which is used to develop markers for candidate gene allele tracing in selection experiments .

snp and indel polymorphisms
the aligned  <dig>  bp included  <dig> insertion-deletion mutations . indels were observed in nine gene fragments except for est <dig> and est <dig>  for one out of eight genes spanning both coding and non-coding regions, indels were only observed in non-coding regions, whereas for three genes, indels were only observed in coding regions. for the remaining four genes, indels were observed both in the coding and non-coding regions, and their frequency in the non-coding region was substantially higher than in the coding region.

excluding indels, the length of aligned sequences was  <dig>  bp. there were  <dig> snps in the  <dig>  bp , which is  <dig> snp per  <dig> bp within the lts, representing  <dig> alleles per locus. out of those,  <dig> sites were tri-allelic, and only  <dig> sites were tetra-allelic. among the  <dig> genes, the number of snps varied substantially from  <dig> in est <dig> to  <dig> in est <dig> within about  <dig> bp . three gene fragments  showed a high percentage of snp polymorphisms . in contrast, only  <dig> % polymorphic sites were detected in the  <dig> kb region of est <dig>  candidate genes with a high density of snps such as est <dig>  est <dig>  est <dig>  and est <dig> showed singletons for many sites, as well as the majority of sites with  <dig> or  <dig> snp variants.

on average, the percentage of polymorphic sites in non-coding regions was two-fold higher than in coding regions of est <dig>  est <dig>  and est <dig>  for three genes , there was a similar snp density in non-coding and coding regions. two genes displayed a higher snp density in coding compared to non-coding regions: est <dig> and est <dig>  for three gene fragments containing exclusively coding regions, the snp density varied substantially with  <dig> snps in est <dig>  and only  <dig> and  <dig> snps in about  <dig> bp of est <dig> and est <dig>  respectively.

across all  <dig> genes,  <dig> snp every  <dig> bp  was found between two randomly sampled sequences. however, the snp density differed substantially between gene classes. nbs-lrr genes showed a very high snp density of one snp every  <dig> bp between two randomly sampled sequences, whereas non-nbs-lrr genes showed a limited snp density of one snp every  <dig> bp.

nucleotide diversity
three nbs-lrr genes, est <dig>  est <dig>  and est <dig>  showed the highest pairwise nucleotide diversities  among the  <dig> lts genotypes , whereas est <dig> and est <dig> showed the lowest pairwise nucleotide diversities . for four out of the eight candidates with sequences from both coding and non-coding regions, the coding regions showed higher pairwise nucleotide diversities than the corresponding non-coding regions. the synonymous mutation rate was about two-fold higher than the non-synonymous mutation rate for est <dig>  est <dig>  est <dig>  est <dig>  est <dig>  and est <dig>  the non-synonymous mutation rates for est <dig> and est <dig> were about 2-times higher than synonymous mutation rates. for the remaining three genes, synonymous and non-synonymous mutations were present at a similar frequencies .

selection
tajima's d was negative and not significant for four candidate genes, indicating that a few alleles predominated, whereas most other alleles showed low frequencies . for the remaining seven genes, positive tajima's d values were obtained from the  <dig> lts genotypes. tajima's d statistic for est <dig> was significant for the  <dig> lts genotypes at the level of p =  <dig> , for both coding and the entire  <dig> kb region.

ld decay
for all studied nbs-lrr genes, except for est <dig>  ld decayed within 15– <dig> bp . in contrast, ld decayed within 300– <dig> bp for the non-nbs-lrr genes . a higher level of ld exceeding the sequenced  <dig> kb region was found for est  <dig> . very low ld was detected for est <dig> , est <dig>  est <dig>  est <dig>  and est <dig>  . out of those, only est <dig> contained a small number of snps  and showed a low degree of nucleotide diversity . for the other four genes, a large number of snps  were detected in the sequenced  <dig> kb region. seven genes showed low levels of ld with r <dig> values below  <dig>  within distances of  <dig> bp  .

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
variable nucleotide diversity among  <dig> expressed resistance candidate genes
the findings of this study are in agreement with high levels of genetic diversity within the out-crossing species lolium perenne. the pairwise nucleotide diversity for our sample of genes and genotypes of one snp every  <dig> bp   was higher than in several other studies  <cit> , where pairwise nucleotide densities ranged from  <dig> snp per  <dig> bp  in a 20-kb interval containing the arabidopsis thaliana disease resistance gene rps <dig>  <cit> , to  <dig> snp per  <dig> bp in soybean  <cit> . snp densities varied substantially between ryegrass genes, ranging from  <dig> snp per  <dig> bp in three nbs-lrr genes  to  <dig> snp per  <dig> bp in a pkpa gene . the overall high snp density was mainly caused by the three genes est <dig>  est <dig>  and est <dig>  with more than  <dig> snp sites within  <dig> kb. when excluding these three genes, the average snp density decreased to  <dig> snp per  <dig> bp in our sample of  <dig> lts genotypes, which was similar to the snp density of  <dig> snp per  <dig> bp detected on maize chromosome  <dig> for  <dig> genotypes  <cit>  and  <dig> snp per  <dig> bp in  <dig> accessions of arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . due to the organisation of nbs-lrr genes in large gene families, amplification and sequencing of paralogues rather than allelic sequences might have lead to the high snp densities for these three genes. however, there was neither a sub-grouping of "allele sequences" within these genes , nor single very different "alleles", which lead to the high snp densities. after removing the most divergent alleles for these three genes, the total number of snps did not decrease substantially and still was above  <dig> per gene. therefore, alleles within these genes seem to be highly variable, which might be in agreement with an active role in multiallelic gene-by-gene interactions with pathogen isolates . this is further supported by the finding, that the maximum number of haplotypes per gene,  <dig> , was identified among the nbs-lrr gene class, whereas a substantially lower number of haplotypes,  <dig> , was found for non-nbs-lrr resistance gene candidates.

however, high snp densities were only detected for some but not all nbs-lrr genes. possibly nbs-lrr genes with limited allele variability interact with pathogens with only low numbers of pathotypes , or are of an evolutionary recent origin. another reason for the large differences in snp densities between nbs-lrr genes might be that the sequenced  <dig> kb regions were located in different parts of the genes, which might contain conserved regions  or hypervariable regions such as the solvent-exposed positions of the lrrs  <cit> . for example, the sequenced  <dig> kb region of est <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> with high snp densities included hypervariable regions.

high homozygosity
the observed heterozygosity of the  <dig> lts genotypes determined by snp haplotypes was 2-times lower than expected. since only five pcr fragments were sequenced per genotype, some alleles might have escaped for statistical reasons, or due to preferential amplification of one out of two alleles within a heterozygous genotype. however, these reasons cannot explain for the large discrepancy between observed and expected heterozygosity. another explanation is, that the  <dig> genotypes collected from different regions in europe suffered from regional isolation, with only a limited number of alleles segregating in each of the regions. the most likely explanation is that several of the lts genotypes originate from breeding programs, with some degree of inbreeding.

natural selection resulting in high levels of sequence diversity within r genes
in theory, silent mutations including mutations in noncoding regions and synonymous mutations in coding regions have less severe phenotypic effects than non-synonymous mutations, changing the amino-acid composition. thus, a relatively higher proportion of silent mutations are expected for "functional genes" underlying natural selection. however, in this study, only three  out of  <dig> genes showed 2-fold more polymorphic sites in noncoding regions than in coding regions. significantly higher polymorphism rates in coding than in noncoding regions were detected in est <dig> and est <dig>  for the other three genes, the frequency of segregating sites was similar in both coding and noncoding regions. r genes showed very high levels of nucleotide diversity in other studies  <cit> . high frequencies of polymorphic sites in coding regions, ranging from  <dig> % to  <dig> %, were observed in the four nbs-lrr genes est <dig>  est <dig>  est <dig>  and est <dig>  probably no or little selection pressure occurred at these loci during evolution, so that several mutations could be maintained. in addition, these genes were identified as cdna sequences, and should therefore, not be pseudogenes. however, in some cases alleles might have turned into non-expressed "pseudo-alleles", which might mutate more rapidly.

the lrr domain of r proteins of plants is suggested to interact directly or indirectly with pathogen elicitors to determine race specificity. hypervariability in the lettuce rgc <dig> family involved in pathogen recognition was observed in the 3'-encoded lrr domain. moreover, two times higher rates of nonsynonymous than synonymous substitutions were detected  <cit> . the study of the complete nbs-lrr gene family in the arabidopsis genome showed that lrrs were hypervariable and subject to positive natural selection, approximately 70% of the positively selected sites are located in the lrr domain, whereas the remaining 30% are located outside the lrr domain  <cit> . in this study, four nbs-lrr like gene fragments , each with about  <dig> haplotypes, showed very high nonsynonymous mutation rates , leading to altered amino acid sequences. three of them included lrr regions. for est <dig>  only nonsynonymous mutations were found, indicative of positive selection. particularly lrr regions showed very high diversity with one snp every  <dig> bp between two sequences  on average. however, this high nonsynonymous rate was only observed for nbs-lrr genes but not for the other genes investigated in this study. this is in agreement with a study of sequence diversity of  <dig> r genes in arabidopsis  <cit> .

distinct forms of selection produce specific patterns of sequence diversity  <cit> . plant – pathogen interactions tend to increase the amount of genomic mutations in r genes in the long process of natural selection. neutral theory of molecular evolution  <cit>  classified mutations into three types: neutral , deleterious , and beneficial . according to neutral evolution theory, silent mutations should be randomly maintained in the long history of evolution. therefore, only neutral variation should be observed. in this study,  <dig> out of  <dig> genes followed the 0-hypothesis . the only exception was est39: tajima's d statistics was significant for est <dig> among the  <dig> lts, indicating that the neutral mutation hypothesis cannot explain the occurrence of the mutations both in the coding and the entire  <dig> kb region. however, the disease resistance system in plants seems to preserve rare alleles, since 78% of alleles for the  <dig> genes were rare alleles . strong natural selection pressures are expected on genes involved in recognition mechanisms in host-pathogen relationships  <cit> . therefore, fast evolutionary patterns should result from the competition between infection and defence systems, and increase allelic diversity. on the other hand, disease resistance is a very important fitness trait, thus high polymorphism in r genes may be the consequence of natural selection that maintain both resistance and susceptibility alleles. there might in addition be different pathogen virulences present in different regions of the world, leading to maintenance of different resistance alleles in distinct regions. however, also absence of selection pressure  could explain for large variation within genes. thus evolution creates an excess of "silent" r genes, which "wait" for novel pathogen virulence genes in future.

ld association mapping for qtl
population mating patterns and admixture can influence ld. generally, ld decays more rapidly in outcrossing species as compared to selfing species  <cit> . when the rate of ld decay is rapid, ld mapping is potentially very precise. the factors affecting the number of sensory hairs were mapped by ld mapping on drosophila thorax  <cit> . in maize, rapid ld decay at the d <dig> locus was prerequisite to detect associations of polymorphisms between snp and indel polymorphisms in the d <dig> gene with plant height and flowering time  <cit> . skøt et al.  <cit>  conducted association mapping to identify flowering time genes using aflp markers in natural populations of lolium perenne. they found three closely linked markers within a major qtl region on chromosome  <dig> highly associated with heading date. they suggested that association mapping approaches maybe feasible at the marker level in l. perenne. however, the majority of all pairwise comparisons did not show significant ld at the level of p =  <dig> . if the threshold of significant ld value was set to  <dig> , there was no ld among linked marker pairs in their study, which is in agreement with the low ld found in our study. noel et al.  <cit>  calculated ld statistics for drought tolerance-associated lpasra <dig> snps using  <dig> diverse perennial ryegrass individuals. they found very limited intragenic ld. in this study, substantial ld decay was found within a physical distance of  <dig> bp for most genes. thus for a whole genome scan, either a very dense marker coverage  or experimental populations with higher ld would be required. however, for candidate gene based association studies, a very high genetic resolution can be expected, when working with natural populations in l. perenne. hence, ld based association analysis is feasible within candidate genes and promising for qtl fine mapping in ryegrass.
