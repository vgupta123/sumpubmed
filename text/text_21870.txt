BACKGROUND
in eubacteria, a primary strategy for gene regulation is the modulation of transcriptional initiation
. this is typically controlled by an rna polymerase, along with its sigma factors, and can be modified  by transcription factors 
 <cit> . the number of sigma factors and tfs encoded in a given genome varies across bacterial species
 <cit> . usually, bacteria with large genomes have numerous sigma factors and tfs
 <cit> , suggesting a positive correlation between genome size and the content of transcriptional regulators. this observation also applies to the bacterial lifestyle, as large genome-sized species usually dominate in environments where resources are scarce and conditions fluctuate, such as in soil
 <cit> . the use of specific sigma factors and numerous tfs ensures a very specific promoter recognition and highly gene-specific transcriptional control
.

additionally, small rna transcripts , which are not translated into proteins, have recently been identified as key elements that regulate the bacterial stress response
 <cit> , pathogenicity and other cellular processes, for example; chromosomal replication, cell division
 <cit> , rna processing
 <cit>  and protein stability
 <cit> . these small transcripts are a heterologous group of molecules that can act by base-pairing to mrnas to modify translation efficiency and the stability of the mrna 
 <cit>  or by binding to proteins to modify their activities. in plant symbiotic bacteria, several computational predictions and experimental studies have been conducted to identify and characterize these elements
 <cit> . however, despite those efforts to identify novel ncrnas, the characterization and identification of ncrna targets is still a rather unexplored subject
 <cit> .

rhizobium etli is a soil bacterium that can associate with the roots of the common bean 
 <cit> . these bacteria are able to establish a symbiotic relationship with legumes; in such a relationship, the formation of root nodules is induced and the r. etli in these nodules differentiates into nitrogen-fixing bacteroide
 <cit> . these bacteroides convert dinitrogen into ammonium, which the plant uses as a nitrogen source. similar to the genomes of soil-living bacteria, r. etli shows high levels of genome plasticity and genome redundancy, which is reflected in the number of sigma factors. in this regard, r. etli encodes twenty-three sigma factors, a housekeeping gene σ <dig> , two σ <dig> , two σ <dig>  and  <dig> extracellular factor  genes. this sigma factor redundancy is also present in other rhizobia; for instance bradyrhizobium japonicum has  <dig> sigma factors, mesorhizobium loti encodes  <dig> and sinorhizobium meliloti contains  <dig> sigma factors
. to the contrary, very little is known about the ncrnas in r. etli.

in the rhizosphere, bacteria are exposed to the adverse effects that result from changes in salinity and temperature
 <cit> , thus affecting the survival of rhizobium in the soil as well as the initial steps of symbiosis
 <cit> . here, to further characterise the heat and salt shock responses, we explore the transcriptomic response of r. etli ce <dig> by rna-seq following heat  and saline shocks . the first aim of this study was to identify genes that are differentially expressed under these stresses; additionally, we studied the ncrnas and the promoter regions of the up-regulated genes. in doing so, we gained new insights into the global response of r. etli under both stress conditions. our results indicate that replicon contribution is different for different stress responses; furthermore, it seems that the heat shock response is more complex compared to the saline shock response.

RESULTS
identifying the differentially expressed genes
to identify which genes are expressed following either heat shock or saline shock, nine rna-seq libraries were generated from rhizobium etli ce <dig> growth in three different conditions: reference, heat shock and saline shock . three biological and independent experiments were performed for each condition; the general features of the results from each run are shown in additional file
 <dig>  the libraries were sequenced and 15– <dig> million reads were obtained under the control condition, 16– <dig> million under heat shock and 16– <dig> million under saline shock. these numbers indicate that similar amounts of data were generated for the different conditions considered here. the bowtie tool was used to map the reads to the annotated r. etli cfn <dig> genome . an average of  <dig> , <dig>   reads could be unambiguously mapped for the reference condition,  <dig> , <dig>  for the heat shock condition, and  <dig> , <dig>   for the saline shock condition ; as with the data generated, similar amounts of data could be mapped for each condition. because these data were used in downstream analyses, we validated the data set by performing quantitative reverse transcription pcr  of twenty-seven genes selected from the rna-seq analysis . we noted a high degree of correlation  between the log2-transformed values of the quantification cycles  and the log2-transformed rpkm from the rna-seq data.

a previous study showed that the r. etli genome has  <dig> genes distributed across one chromosome and six large plasmids
 <cit> , to identify which of those are differentially expressed under each stress condition, a non-parametric approach was applied to the rna-seq data using noiseq. the differential expression analysis revealed  <dig> differentially expressed genes  under heat shock conditions. of these,  <dig> and  <dig> were up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively. under saline shock conditions, we identified  <dig>  differentially expressed genes. of these,  <dig> and  <dig> were up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively. among the total number of up-regulated genes,  <dig> were specific to heat shock,  <dig> were specific to saline shock and  <dig> were up-regulated under both conditions . considering the total number of down-regulated genes,  <dig> were specific to heat shock,  <dig> were specific to saline shock and  <dig> were down-regulated under both conditions. these results suggest that the response to heat shock could be more complex because the number of differentially expressed genes following heat shock was twice the number observed following saline shock. to determine if these differentially expressed genes were homogeneously distributed across the different replicons, we analysed the location of these genes. we found that 59% of the genes over-expressed under heat shock conditions were located on plasmids, whereas 41% were located on the chromosome. in contrast, under saline shock conditions, 69% of the over-expressed genes were located on the chromosome, and 31% were found on plasmids. in the case of the down-regulated genes, 90% and 80% were chromosomally encoded under heat and saline shock conditions, respectively . additionally, although we found that the over-expressed genes in the heat shock sample were principally located on all plasmids, this trend was more exacerbated in pret42c, pret42d, pret42e and pret42f, and the over-expressed genes in the saline shock sample were located on the chromosome and pret42a. these observations suggest that replicon contribution is different under each stress response, where the pret42c, pret42d, pret42e and pret42f plasmids could be preferentially involved during the heat shock response, and the chromosome and pret42a plasmid could play more significant roles during the saline shock response .figure  <dig>

functions involved in the stress responses
to evaluate which functions are intrinsic to the stress responses, the differentially expressed genes were grouped using the cog and kegg databases. we successfully grouped 87% of the genes that were differentially expressed under heat shock, 80% of the genes under saline shock and 85% of the genes that were differentially expressed under both conditions; the rest of the genes could not be assigned to either the cog or the kegg database. as expected, many of the differentially expressed genes were grouped into functional categories and pathways that are known to participate in adaptations to heat stress, saline stress and other stressful conditions . we next identified the specific genes that are up- or down-regulated under each condition separately and under both conditions.figure  <dig>

chaperones act exclusively in the heat shock response
during the heat shock response, chaperones and proteases are involved in protein folding and the degradation of unfolded proteins, respectively
. here, we found that dnak, grpe, groesch <dig>  groel, ibpa and clpb were up-regulated in r. etli during heat shock stress. of them, dnak and the members of the chromosomally located groesch2-groel operon showed the highest transcriptional levels. these observations were confirmed by qrt-pcr . other heat shock genes were over-expressed in our rna-seq data, including groesf and groel from plasmid pret42f and two members  of the hsp <dig> family of molecular chaperones. in total, fourteen heat shock proteins were over-expressed under heat shock conditions, whereas only two serine proteases  were significantly over-expressed under saline shock conditions. interestingly, no chaperones were found in the set of genes that was up-regulated under both conditions and numerous chaperones and proteases were down-regulated following saline shock . these results could indicate that the recruitment of chaperone proteins seems to be exclusive to the heat shock response.

secondary metabolism is highly represented in the saline shock response
we found that glpd, glgxe and pe <dig> were over-expressed under saline shock conditions. the genes glgx and pe <dig>  which encode a glycosyl hydrolase  protein and a putative maltooligosyl trehalose synthase, respectively, may mediate glycogen accumulation during saline shock. according to the kegg database, these genes are part of the treyz pathway , which is involved in converting maltodextrins  into trehalose. our results suggest that r. etli uses the treyz pathway for the de novo synthesis of compatible solutes  under saline stress conditions
 <cit> . we also found that ndva, which is required for cyclic glucan biosynthesis
 <cit> , was down-regulated following saline shock and up-regulated following heat shock. this is consistent with other studies that have shown a decrease in the expression levels of ndva and ndvb when osmolarity increases in agrobacterium tumefaciens
 <cit> .

over-expression of secretion and transporter systems is a common response to heat and saline shock
most bacterial genomes encode different secretion systems , which provide versatile responses and adaptations to environmental changes. in our data, one heat shock-induced gene  and three saline shock-induced genes  were found to be members of the hlyd family, which is a type i secretion system. furthermore, we also found that components of the type iv secretion system were up-regulated during both the heat and saline shock responses; these genes included virb2a, pd <dig> , trbe , vird <dig>  trbj, trbd, trbb and pd <dig> ; notably, under saline shock, the up-regulation of trbi, trbg and trbf was also triggered . under heat and saline shock conditions, the largest functional category of up-regulated genes corresponded to carbohydrate transport and metabolism . of these up-regulated genes, 71% were abc transporters. we also found that r. etli over-expressed an abc-type transporter for spermidine  under saline shock conditions; spermidine and spermine are polyamine derivatives relevant to various cellular events, such as cell differentiation and membrane functions
 <cit> . therefore, we think that the large proportion of over-expressed abc transporters suggests that these transporters could be playing an important role in bacterial cell viability by exporting secondary metabolites , disaccharides and amino acids to contend with the stressful conditions.

versatile responses of transcription factors
another functional category that was highly represented in r. etli during either the heat or saline stress responses was transcription . twenty-six genes encoding transcriptional factors from the iclr, tetr, gntr and marr families were up-regulated under heat shock conditions, while ch <dig>  ch <dig>  ch <dig> and ch <dig>  which encode transcriptional factors of the marr, lysr and tetr families, were over-expressed under saline shock conditions. it is known that bacteria express different sigma factors under different environmental conditions. of the  <dig> sigma factors present in r. etli, we observed over-expression of three of them following saline shock: ch <dig> , rpoe <dig>  and rpoh <dig> . the transcriptional factors identified here have been implicated in several processes
, such as the osmotic shock and heat shock responses, among others , whereas one of the sigma factors, rpoe <dig>  has also been implicated in the saline and osmotic stress responses
 <cit> .

promoter regions and ncrnas
thus far, we have considered the differentially expressed genes, but another important elements for the regulation of transcription are the promoter region and ncrnas. first, to study the promoter regions in all of the non-coding regions associated with the genes over-expressed in both conditions, an in silico analysis to detect promoter motifs was conducted. analysis of  <dig> up-regulated transcriptional units identified a ggaac-n16-cgtt sequence and a cttgac-n16-cnataa sequence in  <dig> transcriptional units , and this sequence perfectly matched the promoter consensus previously reported in r. etli for σ <dig>  and σ <dig> 
 <cit> . an additional  <dig> motifs showed a cttgaa-n16-cgatat sequence, which is extremely similar to the s. meliloti’s σ <dig>  reported motifs
 <cit>  . in our predictions, twenty-six putative promoters overlapped between rpoh and siga, seven overlapped between rpoh and rpoe, six between rpoe and siga and one among all three of these sigma factors . taken together, these results suggest that overlapping sigma promoter sequences could occur with high frequency and may be common in r. etli.figure  <dig>

it is known that non-coding rnas  play an important role in bacterial gene expression; recent studies have identified ncrnas in r. etli, and most of them are encoded in the intergenic regions
 <cit> . hence, to better understand the stress responses, we also conducted a screen to identify possible ncrnas that are involved in these stress responses. we identified  <dig> intergenic regions of the r. etli genome that showed detectable and reproducible transcriptional activity . of the  <dig> regions,  <dig> had been previously reported as ncrna candidates
 <cit> . eighteen regions  revealed five  non-annotated proteins annotated in other genomes. additionally, rec <dig>  rec <dig>  rec <dig> and rec <dig> matched hypothetical annotated proteins  . among the remaining transcriptional units, rec <dig> showed high levels of transcription, while rec <dig>  rec <dig>  rec <dig>  rec <dig>  rec <dig>  rec <dig> and rec <dig> showed low levels of transcription; these regions did not match any annotated proteins. notably, rec <dig> and rec <dig> were located in the possible 5’-utrs of their proximal genes, suggesting that they might be riboswitches. however, using riboswitch finder and ribosw , these regions did not match any homologous riboswitches in other bacterial genomes; therefore, we considered them to be putative ncrnas. we identified  <dig> differentially expressed ncrnas under heat shock conditions and nine under saline shock conditions. eight of the  <dig> differentially expressed ncrnas were up-regulated following heat shock  and had been previously reported, including a well-characterised rnase p . under saline shock conditions, only two ncrnas were over-expressed ; of them, one was a novel ncrna identified in this study . next, we used matrix predictions  to identify potential promoter elements in the regions 80-nt upstream of the over-expressed ncrnas. most of the ncrna upstream regions harboured motifs for more than one sigma factor, except for the novel ncrna, rec <dig>  which yielded only a single putative siga-dependent promoter. rec <dig>  rec <dig> and rec <dig>  had putative rpoe-like and rpoh-like promoters while rea <dig> and rec <dig> harboured overlapping promoters for siga and rpoh. the fact that we were able to identify potential motifs for sigma factors in the upstream regions of the ncrnas provides additional evidence to support the notion that these ncrnas are real. however, in order to learn about the possible function of these ncrnas futher research is required; we started working in that direction . this analysis clearly indicates that ncrnas are also playing a role in both the heat and saline shock stress responses.table  <dig>

discussion
the main goal of this study was not only to identify genes that are differentially expressed during the saline and heat shock responses but also to characterise other regulatory elements, namely ncrnas and sigma promoter motifs. in doing so, we think a more comprehensive view of bacterial gene regulation and new insights into the global response of r. etli under both stressful conditions can be obtained.

in this study, we considered two stressful conditions, saline and heat shock. we found that these two responses in such conditions are clearly different from each other. first, it seems that transcriptional regulation of the heat shock response involves many more genes. second, the replicon contribution is different during each stress response; pret42c, pret42d, pret42e and pret42f plasmids are preferentially involved in the heat shock response, whereas the chromosome and pret42a plasmid participate in the saline shock response . previous studies have also suggested the importance of plasmids for stress responses
. for instance, roles of plasmids  in nodule formation in r. etli and related species have been demonstrated
 <cit> . moreover, the contributions of pret42a to psym transfer and pret42a, pret42b and pret42c to heat shock tolerance have been shown
 <cit> . recent studies have shown that several bacteria have a clear genomic and transcriptional organisation
 <cit> . for example, it was demonstrated caulobacter crescentus has a chromosome that is spatially organised throughout its lifetime, and it was recently demonstrated that the naturally abundant groesl mrna displayed a limited dispersion from its site of transcription during growth under normal and heat shock conditions. this result implies that the cell interior is functionally compartmentalised into small subcellular regions defined by the genetic map and organisation of the c. crescentus genome
 <cit> . in r. etli, the chromosome and all of the plasmids encode active partition systems, which provide a specific location in the cell
 <cit> . taking this fact into account and considering the abundance of plasmid up-regulated genes following heat and saline shock, it is reasonable to suppose that plasmids are important mobile elements that provide a transcriptional spatial compartment to help organise the response to stress. moreover, the abundance of up-regulated genes related with the stress response in r. etli plasmids could be an important adaptive advantage because sets of genes required for particular environmental stresses can be horizontally acquired and distributed across r. etli populations in a fast and efficient way.

another clear feature that differentiates these two responses is the specific functions that are involved in each response. next, we discuss the functions activated under each response and those activated in response to both stresses. chaperones and proteases are involved in protein folding and the degradation of unfolded proteins during the heat shock response
. along these lines, we found that dnak, grpe, groesch <dig>  groel, ibpa and clpb were up-regulated under heat shock stress. furthermore, three of the proteins encoded by these genes  help to maintain the correct folding of nascent polypeptides under non-stressful conditions but become essential for survival under heat shock conditions. for instance, in e. coli, the association of dnak, dnaj and grpe is crucial for the regulation of the levels of rpoh 
, which is involved in controlling the gene expression of heat shock proteins. notably, both rpoh mutants in e. coli
 <cit>  and rpoh <dig> mutants in r. etli
 <cit>  are extremely sensitive to heat shock. additionally, these heat shock proteins  have been also found over-expressed in rhizobium tropici, which is recognized for its tolerance to high temperatures
 <cit> . remarkably, while  <dig> heat shock proteins were over-expressed following heat shock, only two serine proteases degpch <dig> and degpch <dig> were significantly over-expressed under saline shock. these proteases were found to be involved in the elimination of inactive protein aggregates that accumulated in response to saline stress in s. meliloti
. of note, the set of up-regulated genes shared in the two conditions did not include any chaperones; furthermore, numerous chaperones and proteases were down-regulated under saline shock condition . therefore, these results suggest that the recruitment of chaperone proteins seems to be exclusive to the heat shock response.

in rhizobia, glycogen accumulation helps restore cell volume after osmotic shock
 <cit> , and high expression levels of glga <dig>  glgb <dig> and glgx in s. meliloti support this 
CONCLUSIONS
 <cit> . a study in rhizobium tropici prf <dig> has reported that glgx together with nod-genes could be involved in the signal exchanges between host plant and rhizobia
 <cit> . here, we noted that glpd, glgxe and pe <dig> were over-expressed in r. etli under saline shock. these genes are part of the treyz pathway, which converts maltodextrins  into trehalose, thus suggesting that r. etli uses the treyz pathway for the de novo synthesis of compatible solutes  under saline stress conditions
 <cit> . we think this might be true as trehalose and glycine betaine are known to function as osmotic stabilisers
 <cit> , and trehalose biosynthesis is a common response to osmotic stress in many bacteria
 <cit> . all this information suggests that these genes have an important roll not only in the free-living state during stressful conditions, but also in the symbiotic state with the host-plant p. vulgaris. furthermore, in rhizobium, the accumulation of betaine and trehalose allows the bacterium to survive under osmotic stress conditions and reduces the negative effects of nacl
 <cit> .

our data suggest that the over-expression of secretion and transporter systems may be a common response to both heat and saline shock responses. for instance, ch <dig> and ch <dig>  ch <dig>  pf <dig> were found to be members of a type i secretion system , which exports a variety of compounds, from drug molecules to large polypeptides, and is mainly involved in the secretion of noxious molecules across the cellular envelope
. recent studies have suggested that type i secretion systems are involved in the translocation of unfolded proteins
. additionally, a set of genes  from the type iv secretion system was up-regulated during both the heat and saline shock responses. of note, under saline shock conditions, the up-regulation of trbi, trbg and trbf is also triggered, whereas trbe is over-expressed following heat shock. proteins from the type iv secretion system participate in a system that mediates the conjugative transfer of dna with the extracellular milieu, and some even deliver dna to fungi, plants or human cells
 <cit> . obviously, this process plays an important role in bacterial fitness under changing environmental conditions. noticeably, under heat and saline shock conditions, the largest functional category of up-regulated genes corresponded to carbohydrate transport and metabolism  - most of these genes encode abc transporters. these proteins belong to one of the two mayor groups of transporters indentified in gram-negative bacteria, which can carry a wide variety of substrates, including sugars, amino acids, polysaccharides and peptides
. this trend does not seem to be exclusive to r. etli, as the genomes of α-proteobacteria tend to encode disproportionately large numbers of abc transporters, reflecting their ecological versatility and their need to adapt to various conditions
 <cit> . following heat and saline shock, one-third of the up-regulated genes encode abc transporters; of these genes,  <dig> % were annotated as sugar transporters. in s. meliloti and other rhizobia, disaccharides have also been recognised as osmoprotectants
 <cit> . we also found that abc-type transporter for spermidine  that was over-expressed following saline shock. polyamines have been shown to be crucial for salt tolerance and the osmotic stress responses of soil microorganisms
 <cit> , as they can act as osmoprotectants because their cationic nature allows them to bind to proteins and lipids and thus stabilise cellular structures
 <cit> . additionally, we noted repression of the ch <dig> gene under both conditions, which encodes an ornithine decarboxylase responsible for decarboxylating ornithine to putrescine, suggesting that at 30 min after induced stress, the synthesis of spermidine could be repressed. therefore, we think that many of the over-expressed abc transporters play an important role in cell viability by exporting secondary metabolites , disaccharides and amino acids to contend with the stressful conditions. besides, these abc transporters could be part of the general stress response in r. etli.

sigma factors are key to the stress response, as the use of alternative sigma factors creates flexibility in bacterial adaptation. here, we observed over-expression of three sigma factors following saline shock: ch <dig> , rpoe <dig>  and rpoh <dig> . in r. etli, rpoe <dig> participates under oxidative, saline and osmotic stresses and also controls the expression of rpoh <dig>  whereas rpoh <dig> mutants were reported to be sensitive to nacl shock
 <cit> . thus, these two genes play roles in cell survival during the saline shock response. we also detected constitutive expression of rpoh <dig> under heat shock and in the reference condition, which was previously shown to be essential for the heat shock response in r. etli
 <cit> . similar patterns have been observed in other bacteria, where the levels of mrna-rpoh are maintained at a basal concentration
 <cit> . in e. coli, the mrna of rpoh contains a thermo-switch within the 5’-utr of the mrna
 <cit>  that under non-stressful conditions blocks the translation of the rpoh gene, whereas under stressful conditions  allows the translation of rpoh
 <cit> . studies in b. japonicum have demonstrated that this level of regulation is also present in rhizobial species
 <cit> . for example, some heat shock genes are translationally controlled by a secondary mrna structure called rose ; this regulatory element mainly affects genes that encode small heat shock proteins, but it also controls rpoh <dig>  which encodes one of the three σ <dig> factors in b. japonicum
 <cit> . future studies are warranted to investigate whether an analogous mechanism exists in r. etli. additionally, the regulatory region of rpoh <dig> in r. etli contains two promoters: one for σ <dig> and one for σ28
 <cit> . these results indicate that the constitutive expression of rpoh <dig> in r. etli could be regulated by its primary sigma factor . however, the qrt-pcr expression data revealed that ch <dig> is differentially expressed under heat shock, in contrast with the observed data in the rna-seq analyses. these results could be explained by the fact that in the qrt-pcr experiments, the cdnas were obtained with specific primers, ensuring that the cdna belonged to the target gene. additionally or alternatively, the biological noise in our rna-seq libraries could be the reason for this . nonetheless, the regulation of rpoh by rpoe is retained in many bacteria. in this study, we identified the over-expression of three sigma factors; two of them belong to sigma factor rpoe family, which could regulate the rpoh sigma factors in r. etli under heat and saline shock. however, further studies on the  <dig> ecf-sigma factors and their targets should be performed in r. etli because the regulatory networks of these sigma factors have not been fully explored.

the identified promoter motifs were expected as the transcriptomes were obtained under stressful conditions, where both rpoh <dig> and rpoh <dig> are essential. clearly, this approach does not discriminate promoter motifs between the alternative sigma factors rpoh <dig> - rpoh <dig> and rpoe <dig> - ch01118-ecf. however, studies of the r. etli regulons rpoe <dig> and pf00052-ecf have identified a unique sequence motif, which has been recognised for both ecf-type sigma factors, resulting in a large number of overlapping regulated genes
 <cit> . moreover, analysis of rpoh’s regulons in s. meliloti has identified the same tendency of a high number of similar sequences in their promoters
 <cit> . a recently massive exploration and mapping of σh, σe and σ <dig> promoters in s. meliloti revealed highly similar promoter sequences between alternative sigma factor copies
 <cit> . these results indicated that the regulation of the different sigma factors in a given genome could depend on alternative and more complex regulatory systems that include the participation of transcriptional factors, riboswitches, ncrnas and posttranslational regulatory strategies. therefore, specific sequence-promoter recognition may be limited to a few events. in support of this idea, it is well known that in e. coli and other bacterial genomes, promoters belonging to the σ <dig> family can overlap
 <cit> . for instance, in the case of e. coli, overlapping rpoh and rpod  promoters have also been reported
 <cit> . here, we note that in the overlapped promoters, the − <dig> box was maintained in the two promoter predictions, and only the − <dig> box was displaced. in most cases, this displacement involved only a few bases in either direction . this result is also supported by the observation of lax promoter recognition in r. etli 
 <cit>  and by the occurrence of additional promoter-like signals that could play a regulatory role. in bacteria, the promoter-like signals tend to be generated easily, resulting in selection for functionally redundant promoter sequences
 <cit> . alternatively, the complex regulation of the − <dig> box has led several authors to consider that it may comprise a different type of promoter
 <cit> . in e. coli, the − <dig> box  is not a single recognition element; instead, it seems to function as two recognition elements: one primarily positioned at − <dig> in the double strand and another based on the melting of the − <dig> to − <dig> positions in a single strand
 <cit> . our results, along with the findings from other studies, suggest that the overlapping of motifs for the different sigma factors might be a common occurrence, which in turn suggests that additional elements  could be playing roles in determining the specificity of any given stress response.

the regulatory networks that allow bacteria to respond to different environmental stresses usually comprise transcriptional regulators, sigma factors, proteases and small ncrnas
 <cit> . in this work, we identified  <dig> differentially expressed ncrnas under heat shock and  <dig> under saline shock conditions. of note, this result is consistent with our finding that more genes are up-regulated during the heat shock stress response, as here we also find that more ncrnas were up-regulated during that stress response. we think these ncrnas are real entities for several reasons. first, some of them have been previously reported. in the case of the heat shock response, eight of the up-regulated ncrnas  were previously described
 <cit> , whereas under saline shock conditions, two ncrnas  were identified previously
 <cit> . secondly, we detected reproducible transcriptional activity ; besides, sigma promoter motifs were identified for some of these ncrnas. the analysis on ncrnas in this work show that these molecules are an important part of the response to both heat and saline shock stress, future studies are required to establish relevance of these molecules in such stresses.

in considering the results, we believe that the heat shock response is more complex than the saline shock response. not only does the heat shock response involve more differentially expressed genes and more ncrnas, it also uses more replicons. further studies are required to establish if these observations also occur at the translational level.
