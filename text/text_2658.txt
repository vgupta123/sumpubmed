BACKGROUND
sperm-egg interaction is a complex molecular process leading to gamete fusion mediated by a series of molecular interactions. evidences have been put forward suggesting the involvement of members of the adams, tetraspanins and integrins families in this mechanism. recently, izumo, a sperm protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily, was found to be essential for the fusion  <cit> . three groups reported that cd9-deficient female mice present a dramatic reduction of their fertility due to a lack of fusion ability of their oocytes  <cit> . we recently showed that double knock-out cd9-/-/cd81-/- female mice are completely infertile  <cit>  and that, upon fertilization, cd <dig> tetraspanin controls α6β <dig> integrin relocation in patches on the egg membrane  <cit> .

integrins have also been implicated in sperm-oocyte interaction. based on several experiments, mouse egg α6β <dig> integrin was described to function as a receptor of the sperm fertilin β. during further experiments, the function-blocking mab directed against the α <dig> integrin subunit, goh <dig>  turned out to inhibit sperm-oocyte binding, and peptides derived from the sperm fertilin β disintegrin domain sequence bind to α6β <dig> integrin  <cit> . however, mouse gamete binding and fusion tests using goh <dig> mab gave disparate results, partly according to the technique used for zp removal  <cit> . the binding of sperm to mouse oocytes was not inhibited when zp had been removed using an acidic treatment  <cit>  and the fertilization rate  of cumulus-intact mouse oocytes was not reduced  <cit> . recently, we have shown that goh <dig> strongly inhibited human sperm-egg fusion when the zp had been removed by microdissection  <cit> . moreover, oocytes from α <dig> integrin-deficient mice show normal binding and fusion with sperm, suggesting that the α <dig> integrin is not essential for gamete binding and fusion  <cit> . these results suggested that the α <dig> integrin function could be redundant, possibly with another member of the integrin family also expressed on oocyte membrane. however, according to experiments performed by he et al., none of the integrins known to be present on the oocyte are essential for gamete fusion  <cit> .

major questions about integrins' roles in sperm-oocyte fusion remain unsolved. the possible effect of anti-α6β <dig> antibodies on mouse sperm functions has never been addressed, whereas expression of α6β <dig> integrin on human spermatozoa has already been reported. the integrin subunits α <dig>  α <dig> and α <dig> have also been detected on normal human sperm using flow cytometry, their expressions being reduced in cases of terato- or oligoasthenoteratozoospermia  <cit> . the β <dig> integrin subunit has been detected by histochemistry on basement membrane of the tubuli seminiferi, spermatocytes, spermatids and spermatozoa in human  <cit> . furthermore, a positive correlation between the expression of β <dig> integrin on human spermatozoa and their fertilizing ability has been demonstrated suggesting that sperm integrins may be determinant in egg-sperm recognition and interaction  <cit> . hence, reddy et al. proposed α6β <dig> integrin as a clinical marker to evaluate sperm quality  <cit> . several other studies performed on human sperm demonstrated correlations between their level of integrin expression and their fertilization ability  <cit> . the presence of sperm integrin in human raises the question of its possible expression by mouse sperm. in spite of numerous experiments involving the anti-α <dig> mab goh <dig> in mouse gamete interaction, this point has never been investigated and discussed, whereas it can account for some of the reported data discrepancies.

another point deals with the model of zp-free oocyte that was most frequently used to study gamete interaction  <cit> . to focus the studies on events that occur at the plasma membrane level, the zp was removed by chemical, enzymatic or mechanical methods. indeed, this model prevents any interference between both gamete membranes and is considered to be more convenient for studying their interaction. however, zp removal dramatically modifies the local conditions of gamete interaction and may also explain some contradictory results that have been previously reported. we recently showed that upon zp removal, several integrin subunits, including α <dig>  and tetraspanins are relocated and clustered into patches  <cit> . simultaneously, several oocyte functions related to fusion are modified. hence, in human oocyte, the mab anti-cd <dig> is effective in inhibiting gamete fusion only if it is introduced in the medium before zona removal and not after  <cit> , suggesting that cd <dig> tetraspanin function is bypassed by this membrane remodeling. in this study, we now demonstrate the expression of α <dig> and β <dig> integrin subunits by mouse sperm. we performed ivf assay after preincubation of sperm and/or oocyte with antibodies. experiments were performed using both acid tyrode  zp-free and cumulus-intact oocytes. thus, we demonstrated that mouse sperm express α6β <dig> integrin and that this integrin is involved in the sperm-oocyte interaction process.

RESULTS
alpha <dig> and beta <dig> integrin subunits are expressed on mouse sperm membrane
western blot analysis
expression of α <dig> integrin subunit on cauda epididymal sperm was evaluated by immunoblot analysis. as shown on figure 1a, a specific band at  <dig> kda, the expected molecular weight of α <dig> integrin subunit under reducing conditions, was detected on sperm  and on f <dig> whole cell lysate , serving as positive control. the control using a non-specific rabbit polyclonal antibody was negative. the specificity of this result has been confirmed using another antibody raised against α <dig> integrin subunit and its specific blocking peptide. as illustrated in figure 1b, the specific band present at  <dig> kda with the anti-α <dig> integrin antibody  has disappeared when the anti-α <dig> integrin antibody was preincubated with its specific blocking peptide . these results demonstrated the expression of α <dig> integrin subunit on sperm.

immunofluorescence analysis
immunofluorescence analysis of mouse sperm was carried out with anti-α <dig> and anti-β <dig> integrin antibodies . in parallel, acrosomal status was assessed by pisum sativum agglutinin  staining protocol. data revealed different distribution patterns of the integrin subunits on the sperm membrane as shown in figure  <dig>  freshly recovered non capacitated sperm did not show any distinct fluorescence . after  <dig> minutes under capacitating conditions, more than 70% of sperm presented integrin molecules on their membranes organized in various patterns: dense fluorescent dots of the equatorial region of non acrosome reacted  capacitated sperm  or ar sperm  and an exclusive distribution in the post acrosomal region of ar sperm . control isotype or secondary antibody alone gave no signal . similar distribution, staining and relative proportions were found for β <dig> integrin subunit .

flow cytometry analysis
presence of α <dig> and β <dig> integrin subunits on capacitated mouse sperm was confirmed afterwards by flow cytometry after indirect immunofluorescence staining. capacitated spermatozoa labeled with anti-α <dig>  and anti-β <dig> antibodies  were distributed in single peaks with a mean fluorescence intensity of  <dig> and  <dig> versus  <dig> and  <dig> for control isotype, respectively. freshly recovered non capacitated sperm was not stained .

effects of antibodies against alpha <dig> and beta <dig> integrin subunits on mouse sperm-egg fusion
since the presence of α <dig> and β <dig> integrin subunits on mouse sperm was demonstrated, we next investigated their involvement during fertilization. we evaluated, in the presence or in the absence of antibodies, the percentage of fertilized eggs  in both cumulus-intact and acid tyrode  zona-free egg assays and the average number of sperm fused per egg  in at zona-free egg assays. as these integrin subunits are also expressed by the oocytes  <cit> , we determined to what extent each gamete is involved in the inhibition process. different groups were studied. the group  <dig> was the control ivf. in groups  <dig> and  <dig>  only one of the two gametes  was preincubated with function-blocking antibodies, washed and inseminated without antibodies. in group  <dig>  both gametes were separately preincubated with the function-blocking antibodies, washed and then inseminated without any antibody as in previous groups. in group  <dig>  oocytes were inseminated in presence of antibodies without any preincubation. in groups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  anti-β <dig> antibody was present during the insemination while oocytes, sperm or both had been preincubated with it. results differed according to the presence or the absence of zp. when experiments were performed with isotype  or with medium containing sodium azide at  <dig> % final concentration as controls, no inhibition was detected . it is important to note that none of the function blocking antibody used altered the sperm motility.

fr, fertilization rate; fi, fertilization index; ab, antibody; at, acid tyrode; *, number of spermatozoa per oocyte;§, in groups  <dig> to  <dig> of the anti-β <dig> tests, the antibody was absent during insemination and fr and fi were comparable to the control  , fr and fi in groups  <dig> to  <dig> were no significantly different between them and values given here are means; a, significantly different from control, p <  <dig> ; b, significantly different from control, p <  <dig> ; c, significantly different from group  <dig>  p <  <dig> ; d, significantly different from group  <dig>  p <  <dig> ; e, fr on at zona-free assay was 100%; results represent the mean ± s. e. m from three different experiments.

control fr was 91% ±  <dig>  our protocols of selective preincubation of each gamete allowed us to discriminate between goh <dig> effects on oocytes and sperm respectively. when oocytes  and sperm  were preincubated with goh <dig>  the fr was reduced by 26%  or 45% , respectively. goh <dig> was even more potent in inhibiting sperm than oocyte functions . when both gametes were preincubated , the fr inhibition was 65%  corresponding to the additive effect of goh <dig> on each gamete. the three hours of cumulus-intact oocytes insemination with goh <dig> and without any preincubation  gave nearly a 90% inhibition of the fr, compared to the control . this inhibition was stronger  than that recorded after preincubation of both gametes with the antibody. this could be explained by the inhibition of lately recruited goh <dig> binding sites during the incubation.

effect of g0h <dig> on acid tyrode zona-free egg insemination 
in all groups of at zona-free egg assay, membrane gamete interaction is immediate. because of this extremely rapid process, all eggs were fertilized . goh <dig> mab had no effect on at zona-free oocytes since the fi of group  <dig> was not modified when compared to the control group, showing that zp removal by at renders oocytes insensitive to goh <dig> effects. only sperm preincubation  with goh <dig> significantly reduced the fi. interestingly, if both gametes were inseminated in presence of goh <dig>  without preincubation , the fi was not reduced. in contrast, if the same experiment was performed with cumulus-intact eggs, an almost complete inhibition was observed. therefore: 1) the at zona removal induced a disappearance of the goh <dig> effects on the oocytes, 2) sperm goh <dig> effect is not immediate and requires a delay to be effective. this explains that sperm preincubation inhibits zp-intact but not at-zp-free oocytes fertilization and suggests that the time to get through the zp could be a necessary delay for sperm inhibition to appear.

cumulus-intact and acid tyrode zona-free egg assays with anti-beta <dig> integrin subunit antibody 
gamete preincubation with anti-β <dig> mab , both in cumulus-intact and at zp-free assays, had no effect  while the presence of the antibody during insemination impaired gamete interaction  and was not modified by any preincubation. in cumulus-intact eggs assay, in presence of anti-integrin subunit β <dig> mab, the fr was significantly decreased by approximately 70% , compared to the control group. in at zona-free egg assays, all inseminated oocytes were fertilized , but a significant reduction in the fi  was obtained in all groups.

zona pellucida removal modifies alpha <dig> and beta <dig> integrin subunits distribution
in an attempt to explain the lack of anti-α <dig> antibody effect on at zona-free oocytes, we studied the localization of α6β <dig> integrin on zona-intact and at zona-free eggs by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy analysis. about  <dig> optical sections, representing nearly half of the eggs, were collected and superimposed using the maximum projection function as shown on figure  <dig>  whereas the α <dig> and β <dig> integrin subunits were distributed homogeneously with fine punctuations around the egg surface of zona-intact oocytes , zp removal resulted in a modification of the alpha <dig> and beta <dig> integrin subunits distribution. indeed, both formed patches on the at zona-free oocyte membrane . this integrin redistribution induced upon at zp removal seems to put the oocyte at a stage in which integrins are no longer required for adhesion/fusion, explaining in turn the absence of anti-α <dig> antibody effect on at zona-free oocytes during fertilization.

discussion
here, we show that the α6β <dig> integrin is expressed on mouse sperm and is functionally involved in the sperm-oocyte interaction process. these data reinforce the role of α6β <dig> integrin in the process of gamete interaction  <cit> . we also confirm that at-zp removal bypasses the α6β <dig> integrin function in mouse oocyte at the time of gamete interaction.

we show that mouse sperm express α6β <dig> integrin by western blot analysis, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. this last technique enables to localize the α6β <dig> integrin on the surface of capacitated and capacitated and ar spermatozoa. alpha6beta <dig> integrin clusterisation at the surface of the spermatozoon head in a dotty pattern suggests its activation. as the fertilizing spermatozoon normally present in the perivitelline space is ar, is more likely to present this staining pattern. as the fusion starts at the equatorial and post acrosomal region  <cit> , this localization of the α6β <dig> sperm integrin reinforces its probable implication in the adhesion/fusion process.

our results are different from those of other groups  <cit> . in our study, when zona pellucida was totally removed by acid tyrode, oocytes were insensitive to goh <dig> effect. consequently, we observed gamete interaction inhibition only when sperm was preincubated with goh <dig>  while almeida et al. reported a total inhibition by goh <dig>  of oocyte-sperm binding and therefore of fusion  <cit> . this inhibition could have been due to goh <dig> effect on both oocyte and sperm. indeed, in these experiments, very brief chymotrypsin treatment was used and may not have completely removed the zona pellucida  <cit> . hence, oocytes were probably not totally insensitive to goh <dig> effect. furthermore, in their experiment, goh <dig> have not been washed out from oocyte preincubation medium before sperm addition, contrary to what we did. therefore, the delay necessary for the spermatozoon to get through the zona pellucida may have stood for the time of goh <dig> sperm preincubation. actually, these experimental conditions were closer to our cumulus-intact ivf ones, accounting for similar results in apparently different ivf conditions. in our previous study, we probably also misinterpreted the goh <dig> effect on the human ivf by allotting it exclusively to the oocyte integrin  <cit> . this effect may have mainly been mediated by the spermatic one.

two previous studies, using zona-intact or cumulus-intact eggs assays, reported goh <dig> lack of inhibition on gamete fusion  <cit> . in the first one, the ivf test was run in small volumes . as stated in the report itself, it is known that ivf is inefficient in these conditions . this might have hidden the goh <dig> inhibition effect. in the second experiment, contrary to the  <dig> hours incubation commonly used and as used in our study, insemination lasted  <dig> hours. therefore, the evaluation of the fr was not performed according to the presence of decondensed sperm head within the ooplasm, but to the two cell stage criteria. this is not the usual criterion to evaluate fertilization per se, but that of egg activation which can also be achieved by parthenogenetic process.

the most frequent argument to rule out the possible role of α6β <dig> integrin in gamete interaction is the fertility of α <dig> or β <dig> integrin subunits deleted mice oocytes  <cit> . however, all the experiments performed with deleted oocytes, including mating, used wild-type spermatozoa. according to our present results which show the presence of the α6β <dig> integrin on sperm, these spermatozoa carried the α <dig> and β <dig> integrin subunits that had been deleted on the oocyte. this means that, prior to fusion, at the gamete membrane merge, these molecules were present. we therefore have to hypothesize that the presence of this integrin on one of the two fusing membranes is sufficient for fusion. such hypothesis is supported by the sperm oocyte membrane exchange occurring prior to fusion we reported recently  <cit> . in this work, we have shown that cd <dig> tetraspanin is transferred with the exchanged membrane fragment from oocyte to sperm. one can hypothesize that sperm α6β <dig> integrin could transfer too and, therefore, may have rescued adhesion and fusion in deleted oocytes. the way to definitively answer the question of the implication of α6β <dig> integrin in gamete interaction during fertilization is the deletion of α <dig> and/or β <dig> integrin gene in both gametes. this part of study is under current evaluation.

in our study, at zona-free eggs were all fertilized whatever the anti-α <dig> or anti-β <dig> integrin subunits antibodies used. this could be explained by the direct free access for sperm to oocyte membrane, preventing the effect of the antibody on the sperm. but, importantly, the fi was not affected even when oocytes were preincubated with goh <dig> showing that they had become insensitive to its effects. thus, the oocyte α6β <dig> integrin is in such a situation that it is no longer needed. as fusion still occurs, we have to conclude that it had been bypassed by the at zp removal. this is another reason for the fr being poorly affected by goh <dig> on at zp-free eggs. similar bypasses have already been described in human eggs upon mechanical zp removal  <cit> . when mouse intact cd9-/- eggs are inseminated, spermatozoa swim into the perivitelline space without binding to the oolemma. on the contrary, large amounts of spermatozoa tightly bind to the oolemma of at zona-free cd9-/- mouse eggs  <cit> .

to investigate this hypothesis, we studied α <dig> and β <dig> integrin subunits distribution on zp-intact and at zp-free oocytes. α <dig> and β <dig> integrin subunits were evenly distributed on the surface of zona-intact mouse eggs . on the oocyte surface of at zp-free eggs, these integrins were detected as well, but in larger regularly arranged patches . the same relocation had been observed in human egg upon zp removal  <cit> . we also have reported a relocation of the α <dig> integrin subunit upon fertilization of mouse zona-intact eggs  <cit>  suggesting that the two phenomena are linked. we can then hypothesize that fertilization and α6β <dig> integrin redistribution are physiologically linked. once this relocation has happened, α6β <dig> integrin has less or no function in the process of gamete binding and fusion. this means that anti-α <dig> antibodies have few or no effect on at zp-free mouse oocytes. for all these reasons and also because is closer to what the physiology should be, experiments using zona-intact eggs have to be preferred to the zona-free oocytes ones.

takahashi reported an α6β <dig> integrin clustering at the point of gamete contact on zp-free oocyte  <cit> . the presence of α6β <dig> integrin on the capacitated and ar sperm suggests another non exclusive interpretation. the cluster of α6β <dig> integrin at the point of gamete contact could also be due to the superimposition of oocyte and sperm α6β <dig> integrin detection. the fact that α6β <dig> is not detectable on the surface of fresh sperm may explain why clusterisation was not reported when using non capacitated sperm  <cit> . in our study, the fertilizing index of at zp-free oocytes was reduced only when sperm had been preincubated with goh <dig>  supporting the existence of a direct effect of this antibody on sperm functions.

CONCLUSIONS
the presence of functional α6β <dig> integrin on mouse sperm raises the question about the role of this integrin in gamete interaction. it appears as one piece of a multimolecular binding and fusion complex which should be present on both oocyte and sperm membranes. as it can be bypassed by the oocyte membrane reorganization upon zp removal, we can hypothesize that binding of its ligand to oolemma α6β <dig> integrin is one of the first steps of gamete membrane interaction process. the only essential molecules that had been recognized so far for sperm-egg binding and fusion are the cd <dig> tetraspanin on the oocyte  <cit>  and on the sperm membrane, the izumo immunoglobulin  <cit> , which are up to date the unique unilaterally distributed molecules. it could be interesting to study its relation to the sperm α6β <dig> integrin. a similar interest should be granted to the integrin potential ligands on the sperm.
