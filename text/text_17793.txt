BACKGROUND
the causative agent of columnaris disease is the bacterium, flavobacterium columnare  <cit> . this fish disease is common in freshwater environments, affects numerous fish species  <cit> , and is responsible for significant economic losses in the us channel catfish  industry  <cit> . virulence is known to vary between strains of f. columnare  <cit>  and there is some evidence that strains vary in host preference  <cit> . infected fish often exhibit external lesions on the body surface, gills and fins  <cit> , but during some outbreaks bacteria can be isolated from moribund fish that exhibit no external signs of infection. flavobacterium columnare is an opportunistic pathogen and is particularly problematic in commercial aquaculture facilities where high fish densities are required for profitability.

a substantial amount of work has been done to develop methods for the rapid identification of f. columnare during outbreaks  <cit>  and in distinguishing between more and less virulent strains of the bacterium  <cit> . efforts have also been made to understand the mechanisms of virulence employed by the organism. several factors have been proposed, including the ability to adhere to surfaces  <cit> , extracellular protease activity  <cit> , and chondroitin ac lyase activity  <cit> . the bulk of the evidence for these factors playing a role in virulence is suggestive, based primarily on observed symptoms of the disease. little work has been done to characterize the genetic basis of virulence due, in part, to the lack of a robust genetic system for the manipulation of this important pathogen. the ability to introduce foreign dna into strains of f. columnare would greatly increase our ability to study mechanisms of virulence in this pathogen.

while no reports of the successful introduction of plasmids or transposons into f. columnare exist in the peer-reviewed literature, other members of the genus flavobacterium have proven amenable to genetic manipulation. expression of genes and replication of plasmids in members of the genus flavobacterium required modifications of existing expression and mutagenesis vectors because systems optimized for the better-studied groups such as proteobacteria do not function in bacteroidetes  <cit> . the first successful mutagenesis of a member of this genus was reported by mcbride and kempf  <cit>  for flavobacterium johnsoniae with the introduction of the bacteroides transposon tn <dig>  <cit>  carrying the erythromycin resistance gene ermf. they also constructed an e. coli-f. johnsoniae shuttle vector by combining the pcu19-based suicide vector plyl <dig>  <cit>  with a cryptic plasmid  isolated from flavobacterium psychrophilum strain d <dig>  <cit> . the transposon has subsequently been shown to work in one f. psychrophilum strain  <cit>  and the shuttle vector has been introduced into both f. psychrophilum  <cit>  and flavobacterium hibernum  <cit> .

the successful introduction of these vectors into other flavobacterium species led us to hypothesize that, under the proper conditions, f. columnare would be susceptible to genetic manipulation using the vectors and markers described above. the objective of this study was to determine the conditions required for f. columnare to accept dna by conjugal mating and to begin exploring the potential of a green fluorescence protein  based reporter system for the study of native f. columnare promoters.

RESULTS
introduction of pcp <dig> into f. columnare
the e. coli – flavobacterium shuttle vector pcp <dig> was introduced into f. columnare strain c# <dig> by conjugation with e. coli s17- <dig> at a frequency of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> cefoxitin-resistant transconjugants per recipient cell. attempts to extract plasmids from f. columnare cultures with commercial kits resulted in low yields. as a result, the presence of the plasmids in f. columnare strains was confirmed two ways. first, the cefoxitin gene was amplified by pcr with primers pr <dig> and pr <dig> using both the low yield plasmid extractions and genomic dna extracted from cefoxitin resistant f. columnare strains as the template. genomic dna from the cefoxitin sensitive f. columnare parental strain was used as the negative control. in the second approach, the plasmid was reintroduced back into e. coli cells by electroporation using the low yield plasmid extractions as the source of the dna in the transformation protocol. the recovery of the plasmid from these e. coli cells, demonstrated its presence in the cefoxitin resistant f. columnare strains.

ten μg ml- <dig> of cefoxitin was sufficient to prevent background growth as all cefoxitin resistant colonies tested were found to harbor the plasmid. in total, eight of eleven f. columnare strains screened took up pcp <dig> by conjugal transfer. the efficiency of the transfer was not estimated for any strains other than c# <dig>  but based on the number colonies seen on the selection plates, two of the strains  appeared to take up the plasmid at an efficiency lower than that achieved with c# <dig>  the other  <dig> produced transconjugants at rates similar to c# <dig> . the virulence to channel catfish of  <dig> of the  <dig> strains used has been previously reported  <cit> . all  <dig> of the more virulent strains were capable of taking up pcp <dig>  of the  <dig> less virulent strains,  <dig> took up the plasmid and  <dig> did not . the virulence of fc14- <dig> to channel catfish is not known, but it is capable of causing disease in zebra fish   <cit> .

atransconjugates isolated at an efficiency equivalent to that achieved with c#2: ++; transconjugants isolated but at low efficiency: +; no transconjugants isolated: -.

pcp <dig> containing transconjugants were also obtained using erythromycin selection, but for growth to occur, the erythromycin concentration had to be lowered to  <dig> μg ml- <dig>  this resulted in high background growth, indicating that the erythromycin resistance gene ermf does not impart strong resistance to f. columnare. also, the e. coli donor strain was not inhibited by  <dig> μg ml- <dig> of erythromycin, necessitating the use of  <dig> μg ml- <dig> tobramycin for counter selection against the e. coli. filters for conjugation were incubated on flavobacterium columnare growth medium , ordal's, and modified ordal's  plates, and transconjugants were only isolated when fcgm plates were used for this step.

expression of gfp in f. columnare
introduction of the gfp gene into f. columnare strain c# <dig> under control of the map promoter on plasmid pas <dig> resulted in expression of the gene at levels that could be detected by both a fluorescence plate reader and by epifluorescence microscopy . this result demonstrates that gfp expression can be used to detect and quantify expression of native f. columnare genes.

to increase the level of expression, the recently described strong promoter from the f. johnsoniae ompa gene  <cit>  was also placed in front of gfp in pas <dig> creating pas <dig>  pas <dig> was introduced into f. columnare strain c# <dig>  the resulting fluorescence was greater in cells containing gfp driven by the ompa promoter than in cells containing gfp driven by the map promoter . the difference in gfp fluorescence was quantified using the fluorescence plate reader. gfp fluorescence values and standard errors of the mean were  <dig> ±  <dig> ,  <dig> ±  <dig> and  <dig>  ±  <dig> for strain c# <dig> containing plasmids pas <dig> , pas <dig>  and pas <dig>  respectively. the significance of the differences in fluorescence levels detected between strains was assessed using paired t-tests on log-transformed data. after adjusting for multiple tests, all differences were found to be significant with p-values less than  <dig> .

mutagenesis attempts using tn4351
transposon mediated random mutagenesis was performed using the bacteroides transposon tn <dig>  <cit> . tn <dig> contains the erythromycin resistance gene ermf, necessitating the use of erythromycin as the selective marker. as with efforts to use erythromycin to introduce pcp <dig> into f. columnare, antibiotic concentrations of  <dig> μg ml- <dig> or lower were required for any growth to occur. at these low concentrations, a significant amount of background growth was observed. transposon mutagenesis was attempted in three strains  and tn <dig> was successfully introduced into f. columnare strain al-203- <dig>  only two of ten colonies isolated from plates containing  <dig> μg ml- <dig> erythromycin contained the transposon . while the two identified insertions demonstrate that the transposon is capable of integrating into the f. columnare genome, the high number of false positives suggests that this ermf based transposon is not a useful tool for the generation of mutants in this organism.

insertion mutagenesis by homologous recombination
several attempts to make mutants by homologous recombination with the ermf containing suicide plasmid plyl <dig>  <cit>  were unsuccessful. no colonies appeared at erythromycin concentration greater than  <dig> μg ml- <dig>  and significant background growth occurred below this concentration .

a cefoxitin based f. columnare suicide vector, pas <dig>  was created by replacing flavobacterium replicative functions of pcp <dig> with a truncated gldj sequence as described in methods. using the mating protocol described below, pas <dig> was introduced into c# <dig> resulting in the successful isolation of non-motile, cefoxitin resistant colonies . mutants were isolated at an efficiency of roughly  <dig> × 10- <dig> cefoxitin-resistant mutants per recipient cell. this is  <dig> -fold lower than the rate at which the pcp <dig> based shuttle vector, pcp <dig>  can be introduced to strain c# <dig>  disruption of gldj was confirmed by pcr amplification and sequencing of the novel junction formed by the insertion of the mutagenesis vector in to the gldj gene. pcr was done using primers pr <dig> and pr <dig>  sequencing across the novel junction was accomplished from both directions using primers pr <dig> and pr <dig> .

discussion
conditions for conjugal plasmid transfer from e. coli to f. columnare
while some members of the genus flavobacterium have proven amenable to receiving plasmids via conjugal mating  <cit> , no reports exist of the introduction of plasmids into f. columnare. here we report the first successful introduction of plasmids into f. columnare using vectors developed from the f. psychrophilum cryptic plasmid pcp <dig>  <cit> . these results extend the host range of pcp1-based shuttle vectors to f. columnare.

several factors appear to contribute to the successful transfer of plasmids from e. coli to f. columnare. one is the use of culture conditions for the initial growth of f. columnare that allow the cells to grow to relatively high cell density with minimal clumping or biofilm formation. numerous media have been described that support the growth of f. columnare  <cit> , but mo was chosen for the initial growth step due to the rapid growth and minimal biofilm formation observed with the use of this medium. while transconjugants were obtained from cultures grown in both ordal's medium and fcgm, mo was deemed superior because of problems with low cell density, cell clumping, and biofilm formation with ordal's medium. cell clumping was not a problem with fcgm, but not all strains grew to a high cell density in this medium.

a more important part of the mating protocol was the medium used for the conjugal mating step itself. ordal's, mo and fcgm plates were all tested for the incubation of the mating filters, but transconjugants were isolated only when fcgm plates were used. in conjugal mating protocols developed for other flavobacterium species, the concentrated mixtures of donor and recipient cells are spotted onto the mating plates directly  <cit> . with f. columnare, the use of  <dig> mm diameter  <dig>  μm pore size nitrocellulose filters was necessary because the tightly adhering mass of cells was difficult to remove from the agar surface, but could easily be scraped from the surface of the filter.

the conjugation efficiency of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> cefoxitin-resistant transconjugants per recipient cell using pcp <dig> is greater than what has been reported for f. psychrophilum  <cit>  and roughly equivalent to the highest rates reported for f. johnsoniae  <cit> . the fact that eight of eleven f. columnare strains screened took up pcp <dig> suggests that this protocol can be used with many of the virulent strains of f. columnare available for study, although rates of uptake varied between strains and two strains did not take up the plasmid under the conditions tested . this is in contrast to the method developed for f. psychrophilum where only one strain has been shown to be capable of accepting the plasmids,  <cit>  possibly owing to differential dna methylation mechanisms or plasmid incompatibility.

expression of gfp in f. columnare
flavobacterium columnare cells must respond to varying environments over the course of the infection process. these include areas on the external and internal surfaces of the fish as well as the surrounding environment. for example, studies using mucus scraped from the surface of atlantic salmon   <cit>  suggest that f. columnare regulate both biofilm production and extracellular protease activity in response to exposure to fish mucus. the mechanism of dispersal of f. columnare through the host from initial, local sites of infection is also unclear. studies of the response of f. columnare to changing environmental conditions would be aided by gfp-expressing strain, which would allow the direct visualization of either biofilm formation or the infectious process by f. columnare.

for such a strain to be useful, gfp-expression levels must be high enough for easy visualization. promoters that drive gene expression in other gram-negative bacteria generally do not function well in the bacteriodetes  <cit> , including flavobacterium species  <cit> . in bacteroides fragilis, analysis of housekeeping genes led to the description of two consensus regions -7/- <dig> with the following motifs: tanntttg/tttg  <cit> . recently, chen et al.  <cit>  described a strong promoter from the ompa gene of f. johnsoniae that contained these two consensus motifs and led to high levels of fluorescence when used to drive gfp expression. mutation analysis was also used to describe a putative ribosomal binding site  consensus sequence: taaaa found  <dig> to  <dig> bases from the gene start codon  <cit> .

the successful introduction of pcp <dig> into f. columnare led to an evaluation of the shuttle vector as a tool for the study of gene expression. to explore this potential, a promoterless copy of the gfpmut <dig> gene  <cit>  was cloned into the kpni-psti sites of pcp <dig> creating pas <dig>  the kpni restriction site was positioned just upstream of the beginning of the gfp gene. this arrangement allowed for the placement of different promoters upstream of gfp.

in this study, two promoters were assessed. the first was the recently described f. johnsoniae strong promoter pompa  <cit> . the second promoter evaluated was the region upstream of map, a gene which codes for a membrane associated metalloprotease in f. columnare  <cit> . the promoter region of this gene was chosen because protease activity is a proposed virulence factor  <cit>  and real-time rt-pcr analysis suggests that the gene is constitutively expressed in f. columnare .

the pompa region contains all three of the consensus motifs  described above, while the native f. columnare promoter map contains the rbs and - <dig> motifs but not the - <dig> tttg motif. the substantial increase in gfp fluorescence driven by the ompa promoter  relative to the map promoter  is consistent with the findings of others that while the - <dig>  tttg motif is not essential for gene expression, it is necessary for full activity  <cit> . the presence of a native promoter in f. columnare lacking the - <dig> consensus sequence suggests that the absence of this motif is a strategy used by the organism to drive low level constitutive expression of some genes. gene expression studies using constructs such as pas <dig> and pas <dig> should facilitate the study of gene expression under environmentally relevant conditions and the results with the map promoter suggest that gfp expression can be used in the study of moderately expressed f.columnare promoters. the availability of a plasmid containing the gfp gene linked to a strong promoter should also open the door to studies involving the direct observation of live cells under a variety of conditions such as on the surface of fish or in vivo during the infection process.

transposon and site-specific homologous recombination mutagenesis in f. columnare
three resistance markers have been used for the genetic manipulation of flavobacterium species: the erythromycin resistance gene ermf, the tetracycline resistance gene tetq, and the cefoxitin resistance gene cfxa. the cloning vectors pcp <dig>  pcp <dig>  pcp <dig>  pep <dig> and plyl <dig> all contain ermf  <cit> . in addition to ermf, pcp <dig> and pcp <dig> contain tetq  <cit>  and cfxa  <cit>  respectively. while ermf has been found to impart strong resistance to other flavobacterium species  <cit> , the f. columnare strains tested in this study remained sensitive to erythromycin after introduction of ermf containing plasmids. the reason for the poor performance of ermf in f. columnare is not known. it seems unlikely that promoter strength is the issue since the region upstream of the ermf gene contains the strong promoter -7/- <dig> consensus sequence  <cit> . the poor performance of ermf suggests that existing flavobacterium vectors will need to be modified for use in f. columnare.

the successful introduction of tn <dig> into f. columnare strain al-203- <dig> demonstrates that existing transposon-based mutagenesis systems function in f. columnare. nevertheless, the high level of background growth due to the low erythromycin levels required for growth suggests that the existing transposon will need to be modified by the addition of another resistance marker before it is an effective tool for the study of this organism. the modification of the transposon and the identification of additional antibiotic resistance genes functional in f. columnare should be a high priority for future work.

difficulty associated with high background growth was also experienced with attempts to use the ermf based site directed mutagenesis vector plyl <dig> to knock out specific genes by homologous recombination. this led us to construct a new cfxa based vector by removing the flavobacterium origin of replication from pcp <dig>  this construct was used to isolate gldj- motility mutants. while this effort was successful, multiple mating attempts were required before cefoxitin resistant, non-motile mutants were identified. subsequent efforts to disrupt other genes by this approach have been successful, but the process was inefficient, requiring multiple attempts before mutants were isolated . given the efficiency with which pcp <dig> can be introduced into f. columnare, these results suggest that homologous recombination events are rare. this is consistent with work in f. johnsoniae where insertion mutants of some genes have been made by homologous recombination  <cit> , but the efficiencies have been quite low  and attempts with some genes have not succeeded  <cit> .

in e. coli, the major homologous recombination pathway is dependent on the activity of the genes reca, recb, and recc  <cit> . the recently sequenced genomes of f. psychrophilum  <cit>  and f. johnsoniae  reveal that while both contain reca, neither contain recb or recc. the absence of these genes is not unique to flavobacterium  <cit> , but their absence may be part of the reason homologous recombination events are rare in members of this genus. complementation of the motility mutant has yet to be accomplished, demonstrating further the need to develop additional selectable markers and cloning vectors for members of the genus flavobacterium.

CONCLUSIONS
the lack of robust methods for the genetic manipulation of f. columnare represents a substantial barrier to understanding virulence mechanisms in this important fish pathogen. the availability of the conjugation protocol described in this study will facilitate work aimed at deepening of our understanding of the virulence mechanisms of f. columnare. while conditions for efficient random mutagenesis still need to be resolved, the methods described in this report represent a significant first step towards the development of a robust set of genetic tools for f. columnare. in addition to the method for introduction of foreign dna into f. columnare, the new gfp-based reporter constructs should facilitate studies of gene expression and in vivo cell localization.
