BACKGROUND
the steroid-metabolizing enzyme 20α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase  catalyzes the conversion of progesterone, a potent progestin, to the metabolically inactive form 20α-dihydroprogesterone   <cit> . this enzyme belongs to the aldo-keto reductase  superfamily of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate -dependent reductases that act on a wide range of substrates, including steroid hormones and endogenous prostaglandins  <cit> . 20α-hsd plays a crucial role in the modulation and regulation of steroid hormones, such as androgen, estrogen, and progestins  <cit> .

the activity of 20α-hsd is known to be down-regulated by prolactin   <cit> , allowing for the maintenance of progesterone secretion during the first half of pregnancy. however, pgf2α stimulates the expression of 20α-hsd at the end of the pregnancy  <cit> . administration of pgf2α to pregnant rats increases luteal 20α-hsd activity  <cit> . pgf2α is also known to induce abortion in many species, including rodents  <cit> . pgf2α receptor-deficient mice do not show the normal pre-partum drop in progesterone  <cit> . placental lactogen  is another suppressor of 20α-hsd gene expression. the luteotrophic effects of both prl and pl on the corpus luteum  are mediated via the prl receptor  <cit> . progesterone production in the rodent cl is regulated by hormones, including prl and pgf2α, which have luteotropic and luteolytic functions, respectively  <cit> . there is additional evidence that pgf2α may act as an inhibitor of the lactogenic suppression of 20α-hsd expression by increasing the expression of a member of the suppressor of cytokine signaling  family, socs- <dig>  which has been demonstrated to interfere with cytokine signaling through the jak2/stat <dig> pathway  <cit> .

20α-hsd-deficient mice sustain high progesterone levels and present a delay in parturition of several days, demonstrating that 20α-hsd regulates parturition downstream of the pgf2α receptor in an essential and nonredundant manner. 20α-hsd deficiency partially corrected the abortion of pregnancies associated with stab5b deficiency  <cit> . the duration of the estrous cycle, pseudopregnancy, and pregnancy was significantly prolonged in 20α-hsd -/- mice  <cit> . studies on the 5′-flanking region of the mouse 20α-hsd gene demonstrated that the putative sp- <dig> site was critical for the expression of the reporter gene on rat luteinized granulose cells  <cit> . in rats, the regulatory elements of 20α-hsd  are present within a  <dig> -kb 5′-flanking region of the gene. in addition, it was shown that the deletion of this promoter at the -289 bp positions significantly decreased the basal promoter activity  <cit> . pgf2α induces the expression of the nuclear orphan receptor and transcription factor nur <dig> in the cl, which in turn leads to the stimulation of 20α-hsd, triggering a decrease in serum progesterone, which is essential for parturition  <cit> . thus, nur <dig> plays an important role in ovarian physiology by mediating the pgf2α-mediated induction of 20α-hsd in rats. in the human 20α-hsd gene, the transcription factor-binding site for nf-y/cebp located between - <dig> and - <dig> is involved in controlling the basal transcription of 20α-hsd in ovarian, lung, and liver carcinoma cells  <cit> . the transcription factor sp- <dig> regulates the overexpression of 20α-hsd in ht <dig> human colon cells, which are resistant to methotrexate  <cit> . the activity of the human 20α-hsd promoter luciferase was increased by  <dig> -fold upon treatment with pgf2α and oxytocin on porcine ovarian follicle cells  <cit> .

among primates, 20α-hsd has been found in the placenta of humans  <cit> , rhesus monkeys  <cit> , and baboons  <cit> . in humans, the activity of 20α-hsd increased by 5-fold in the placenta from mid to late gestation  <cit> . the progesterone levels in baboon fetuses declined by almost 6-fold from mid to late gestation and this decrease was accompanied by a substantial increase in the concentration of 20α-ohp, a major metabolite of progesterone  <cit> . fetal progesterone concentrations decreased during late pregnancy in the rhesus monkey  <cit> . in recent reports, the expression of human 20α-hsd was detected in the kidneys  <cit> , adipose cells  <cit> , skin  <cit> , osteoblasts  <cit> , and carcinoma cells from the lung  <cit> , endometrium  <cit> , ovaries  <cit> , guts  <cit>  and skin  <cit> . over expression of 20α-hsd has been observed in non-small-cell lung cancer  <cit>  and in esophageal and breast cancer  <cit> .

we previously showed that 20α-hsd was highly detected in ovarian and placental tissues during the pre-ovulation and pre-parturition phases. it was mainly localized in the syncytiotrophoblast of the placenta and isthmus cells of the oviduct in macaque monkeys  <cit> . however, the function and regulation of this enzyme in primate reproductive physiology are not well known. human 20α-hsd gene is controlled by sp- <dig>  <cit> , but there is no report on the regulation of the monkey 20α-hsd promoter activity. therefore, we analyzed that the 20α-hsd gene could be regulated by different transcriptional factors depending on the species.

in the present study, to gain detailed information on the transcriptional regulation factors, we investigated the 5′-flanking region of the monkey 20α-hsd gene promoter. we demonstrated that the ap- <dig> site of the monkey 20α-hsd gene is essential for its promoter activity, is related to the interaction of the ap- <dig> protein with the nuclear extract from chinese hamster ovary  k <dig> cells, and influences the expression of the ap- <dig> transcription factor in pre-parturition placenta and cho-k <dig> cells.

RESULTS
analysis of putative transcription factor binding sites in the monkey 20α-hsd gene promoter
the monkey 20α-hsd gene was used to construct the 5′-2005 bp basal promoter region. the transcription factor binding sites of the monkey 20α-hsd gene promoter was analyzed using the tfsearch software. the promoter region includes a tata  box and two putative ccaat  boxes. moreover, plural transcription factor binding sites were identified, such as ap- <dig>  oct- <dig>  sp- <dig>  nur <dig>  nf-y , cre-bp , sry, and prlre  . various lengths of the 5′-flanking region were constructed to identify the regulatory region crucial for the transcription activity of the 20α-hsd gene. the deleted mutant promoters were designed as -890-luc , -510-luc , -273-luc , and -70-luc , and three mutants were cloned into the pgl- <dig> basic vector .

activity of the deleted promoter regions of monkey 20α-hsd
the pgl3-basic vectors were constructed with promoter deletion mutants of different lengths and their activities were assayed in hamster ovarian cells in comparison with the 2005-bp promoter + pgl <dig> vector  and non-transfected cells . as shown in figure  <dig>  the series of deletion constructs had similar promoter activities. however, when the two constructs -273-luc and -70-luc were transfected, the luciferase activity dramatically decreased. in particular, -70-luc activity was identical to that of the basic pgl <dig> expression plasmid. thus, we postulated that the ap- <dig> site  plays an important role in the activation of the promoter of the monkey 20α-hsd gene. the -306-luc and -513-luc constructs containing the ap- <dig> site were generated, and their luciferase activities were almost the same . the activity of -273-luc highly decreased compared to that of -513-luc and -306-luc. next, to investigate whether these factors affected the transcription of monkey 20α-hsd gene, we transiently co-transfected the constructs into cho cells in combination with the ap- <dig> or sp- <dig> expression plasmids individually and together. the luciferase activity of the three constructs, with the exception of -273-luc and -70-luc, co-transfected with the ap- <dig> and sp- <dig> expression plasmids was high compared to that when only one plasmid was transfected. however, the activity of the -273-luc and -70-luc constructs, which did not contain the ap- <dig> binding site, did not increase when co-transfected with the ap- <dig> and sp- <dig> expression plasmids . therefore, the promoter activity of the monkey 20α-hsd gene may be related to the ap- <dig> transcription factor located between - <dig> and - <dig>  moreover, the sp- <dig> site between - <dig> and -70 bp is also dispensable to promoter activity . this region specifically contains irf- <dig>   <dig>  brn- <dig>  cp- <dig>  sox- <dig>  and gr . it is also interesting to note that the region between - <dig> and - <dig> contains critical regulation sites .

analyses of the putative ap- <dig> binding site by site-directed mutagenesis
based on the above results, to investigate whether preventing the binding of ap- <dig> resulted in decreased the transcription of the 20α-hsd gene, we constructed the -288-luc deletion mutant including the ap- <dig> binding site . additionally, we also constructed mutants within the ap- <dig> binding site , transfected them into cho cells alone or with the ap- <dig> transcription factor, and compared the results with the positive control . as shown in figure  <dig>  the luciferase activities of mutant- <dig>  and mutant- <dig> , in which half of the ap- <dig> site nucleotides were mutated, were not significantly affected. however, the transcription activity of mutant- <dig> , which had all eight nucleotides of the ap- <dig> region mutated, significantly decreased. moreover, the activity of -288-luc co-transfected with the ap- <dig> expression plasmid increased more than that of mut- <dig>  the activity of mut- <dig> and mut- <dig> co-transfected with the ap- <dig> expression plasmid did not change. however, as shown in figure  <dig>  the activity of mut- <dig> co-transfected with ap- <dig> decreased. these results demonstrate that ap- <dig> transcription factor  has a specific binding site for the monkey 20α-hsd gene located in the -281 → - <dig> region.

ap- <dig> expression in cho cells and monkey placenta and analysis by emsa
the ap- <dig> expression level in the placenta from the pre-parturition period and the cho-k <dig> cell line was determined by rt-pcr and western blot . strong expression of ap- <dig> mrna was detected in both cho-k <dig> cells and placenta at pre-parturition. we also found that the ap- <dig> protein was coordinately expressed as a nuclear and cytoplasmic protein in cho cells. however, the expression of the ap- <dig> protein in the monkey placenta was weak. consensus fragments of the oligonucleotide probes for the ap- <dig> mutants were also synthesized. for the emsa, a nuclear protein extract was prepared from cho cell and used with 3′-end biotin-labeled 30 bp  oligonucleotide probes. preliminary emsa analysis showed the presence of ap- <dig> protein-dna complexes. the mutants used for the emsa  were similar to those employed in the luciferase assay. the binding of mut- <dig> and mut- <dig>  which had half of the nucleotides mutated, did not compete with the dna binding as well as the wt construct. however, mut- <dig>  which had all the nucleotides mutated, did compete with the dna binding . thus, partial mutations of the ap- <dig> binding site did not affect the basal activity. therefore, in the present study, we have functionally characterized the monkey 20α-hsd gene basal proximal promoter and provided evidence of the role of the ap- <dig> in cho cells.

discussion
in the present study, we characterized for the first time the transcription activity and regulation of the 5′-flanking region of the monkey 20α-hsd gene located in the -281 → - <dig> region relative to the translational start. this study demonstrated that the ap- <dig> site plays a crucial role in the transcription of the monkey 20α-hsd gene in cho cells. moreover, we clearly demonstrated that ap- <dig> is indispensable for the regulation of the expression of the 20α-hsd gene. the ap- <dig> transcription factor is crucially involved in a multitude of cellular processes, including development and differentiation, cell proliferation, apoptosis, oncogenic transformation, and the response to genotoxic agents  <cit> . the activity of this transcription factor is modulated by growth factors, cytokines, and tumor promoters, such as the phorbol ester 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate   <cit> . jun homodimers have less dna binding activity than do jun/fos heterodimers  <cit> . moreover, the function of the ap- <dig> dimer is cell type-specific and cell cycle-dependent  <cit> . recently, we reported that the monkey 20α-hsd mrna was highly expressed in pre-parturition placenta and pre-ovulation ovary, and it was localized in the syncytiotrophoblast of the placenta. the promoter region of the 5′-flanking region was cloned and the egfp expression signal under the monkey 20α-hsd 2005-bp promoter functioned normally in the cho cell line  <cit> .

in this study, we analyzed the expression of the ap- <dig> factor in the pre-parturition placenta of monkey and in hamster ovarian cells. in rat ovarian cells, the ap- <dig> factor exhibited a specific expression pattern and response to hormones. rapid induction of junb, c-fos, and fra- <dig> by fsh revealed a pattern of other immediate-early genes in granulose cells  <cit> . ap- <dig> proteins are specific in the process of invasion of human maternal tissue by the trophoblast. most of the ap- <dig> family factors are also expressed in the intermediate trophoblast of the placenta during the first trimester and later during pregnancy, with the expression being stronger for jund and fra <dig>  followed by c-jun, c-fos, and fosb. furthermore, jund was expressed in the syncytiotrophoblast  <cit> . ap- <dig> is involved in placenta-specific expression of the mouse and human lactogen i  gene  <cit> , human chorionic somatomammotropin a and b  <cit> , human gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor gene  <cit> , and the collagen digesting enzyme metalloproteinase - <dig> gene that contains an ap- <dig> response element in its promoter region  <cit> . in humans, the expression of ap- <dig> and nfkb increased in the cervical stroma at the time of parturition. in particular, c-jun significantly increased in the end of pregnancy and c-fos immediately increased after parturition, suggesting mapk activation during cervical ripening before labor  <cit> .

in the present study, a reporter assay using constructs of various lengths of the 5′-flanking region revealed that the ap- <dig> region between - <dig> and -274 bp was essential for transcriptional activity. according to the gel shifting assay, the mutant mut- <dig>  which had all the nucleotides mutated, did not have dna binding activity compared to the wild type, mut- <dig>  or mut- <dig> ap- <dig> factor binding sites. recent studies demonstrated that human 20α-hsd was regulated by the nuclear factor-y  in human ovarian, liver, and lung carcinoma cells  <cit> . however, gel shift assays revealed an increase in sp <dig> and sp <dig> binding compared to sensitive cells in methotrexate-resistant ht <dig> human colon cancer cells, without differences in the sp <dig> protein levels  <cit> . a reporter assay of the 5′-flanking region of the mouse 20α-hsd gene revealed that the region between - <dig> and 60 bp upstream of the transcription start site was essential for the transcriptional activity in rat luteinizing granulose cells  <cit> . a putative sp <dig> site in this region was critical for the expression of the reporter gene. finally, the promoter activity was enhanced by the co-transfection of sp <dig> expression vector. thus, the sp- <dig> site between - <dig> and -70 bp needs to be mutated and the activity of the monkey 20α-hsd mutant promoter tested. however, our results indicate that the monkey 20α-hsd gene was regulated by ap- <dig>  thus, we suggest that the 20α-hsd gene could be regulated by different transcriptional factors depending on the species.

prl signals through the jak2/stat <dig> pathway downregulate rat 20α-hsd expression in the decidua. thus, decidual prl plays an important role in pregnancy by repressing the expression of interleukin- <dig>  and 20α-hsd in the decidua  <cit> . the different types of human 20α-hsd inhibitors were reported in an update on the design of potent and active inhibitors based on the crystal structure of the enzyme-inhibitor complex  <cit> . pgf2α induces the expression in the cl of the nuclear orphan receptor and transcription factor nur <dig>  which in turn leads to the transcriptional stimulation of rat 20α-hsd, triggering the decrease in serum progesterone, which is essential for parturition  <cit> . the activation of jun d through a calmodulin-dependent activation of extracellular signal regulated kinases  1/ <dig> mediates nur <dig> induction by pgf2α  <cit> . when forskolin was used to treat luteal cells transfected with the  <dig> -kb rat 20α-hsd promoter reporter gene, it caused a dose-dependent inhibition of luciferase activity within 24 h  <cit> . we also collected data on the acceleration and downregulation of the monkey 20α-hsd gene promoter by pgf2α and forskolin . in humans, during cervical ripening and dilation, the presence of the 20α-hsd enzyme results in progesterone inactivation, attenuation of progesterone action, and cervical ripening  <cit> . in mouse, knockout experiments have revealed non-redundant functions of most of the ap- <dig> family members. with regard to the utero-placental system, these experiments pointed to a specific role for junb and fra- <dig>  inactivation of each of the corresponding genes led to severe growth retardation and early fetal death due to impaired vascularization of the decidua  <cit> . although the nur <dig>  nf-y, and sp <dig> sites were contained inside the ap- <dig> site of the monkey 20α-hsd promoter, we did not perform analyses to detect the complete suppression of the transcriptional activity of the deletion mutants of the ap- <dig> site. however, the 20α-hsd gene was regulated by these factors in humans, mice, and rats. thus, further studies aiming to clarify the regulation of the 20α-hsd gene promoter are needed.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, these findings indicate that the ap- <dig> transcription factor might play a dynamic role in monkey and mammalian reproductive physiology. our previous study determined that the 20α-hsd enzyme is important in the monkey estrous cycle and parturition. in this study, we suggest that 20α-hsd gene expression in the ovary and placenta is regulated by ap- <dig> in the monkey reproductive system during pregnancy and pre-parturition. furthermore, we suggest that the 20α-hsd activity may be important for protecting the fetus from high progesterone levels during parturition because ap- <dig> regulates 20α-hsd gene expression in the placenta and ovaries.
