BACKGROUND
during sporulation, b. thuringiensis  produces a crystal composed of one or more cry proteins with toxicity against insects. the mode of action of the largest group of cry proteins has been extensively studied and can be divided into four main steps:  solubilization of the inclusion body to release the cry proteins in their protoxin form,  gut protease processing of these protoxins to an active toxin,  binding of the active form to specific receptors in the midgut of the insect,  membrane insertion, pore formation, and cellular lysis  <cit> . any alteration in one of these steps could result in the development of resistance to one or several cry proteins in a given insect population.

development of insect resistance to insecticides is one of the most important problems of agriculture because it increases the costs of crop protection and reduces its productivity. more than  <dig> insect and mite species have been reported to develop resistance to one or more pesticides  <cit> . although less in number, several cases of resistance have been also reported for b. thuringiensis insecticides in field populations as well as in laboratory selection experiments  <cit> . with the commercialization of transgenic crops expressing b. thuringiensis toxins  the selection pressure has increased, with the consequent increased risk of resistance development. a high-dose/refuge strategy has been proposed and implemented in some cases to delay the development of insect resistance to bt-crops. the effectiveness of this strategy mainly depends on the mode of inheritance of resistance and the initial frequency of bt resistance alleles. knowledge of the genes involved in bt resistance will allow fast molecular screening for resistance gene frequencies in the field before or during use of a bt crop. furthermore, to determine if refuges or any other resistance management strategy are working, one should keep track of the frequency of resistance in field  <cit> .

so far, the best-characterized mechanism of bt resistance is the alteration of cry protein binding to its receptors in the midgut of the target insect. this alteration has been reported in different populations of plutella xylostella, plodia interpunctella, heliothis virescens, and spodoptera exigua and also for several cry proteins   <cit> . aminopeptidase n  and cadherin-like proteins have been characterized as candidates for cry <dig> toxin receptors  <cit> . gahan et. al,  <dig>  <cit>  studying the h. virescens  resistant strain showed that the major gene for resistance to cry1ac in this strain was highly linked to the locus coding for a cadherin-like protein, and that this gene was disrupted in the resistant strain by the insertion of a retrotransposon. in  <dig>  knight et al.  <cit>  identified an apn as an insect receptor of the cry1ac protein. since  <dig> to today, more than  <dig> different apns from different lepidoptera have been sequenced and registered in databases showing the high diversity in isoforms. other putative receptors for cry toxins are proteins  <cit> , glycoconjugates  <cit> , and glycolipids  <cit> .

previous selection studies in the beet armyworm, s. exigua showed the ability of this insect to develop high levels of resistance  to the cry1ca activated toxin  <cit> . binding of this protein to brush border membrane vesicles  from the midgut of the resistant insects was decreased 5-fold in affinity compared with the susceptible insects  <cit> .

in our study, using suppression subtractive hybridization , we compared s. exigua midgut gene expression between cry1ca-exposed and non-exposed susceptible insects and between resistant and susceptible non-exposed insects in order to identify genes that may be differentially expressed and therefore putatively involved in the insect response to toxin action or in resistance. based on the ssh results, full cdna sequences of four apns were obtained. northern blot analysis showed the lack of expression of one of the apns in the insects from the resistant colony.

RESULTS
isolation of apn encoding cdnas
in order to study genes that might be involved in the insect's response to intoxication by an active cry toxin and/or in the mechanism of resistance to such a toxin, we took the approach of selection of cdnas representing genes, which are differentially expressed in these different conditions. suppression subtractive hybridization  was performed, in the first experiment with midgut cdna from cry1ca-sensitive 5th instar s. exigua larvae that had been raised on either control diet or on diet containing a sublethal dose of cry1ca protein during the entire larval life stage. thus two pools of subtracted cdnas were obtained and cloned, one presumably containing cdnas representing genes with increased expression  and one representing genes with decreased expression  in response to toxin exposure, respectively.

in a second experiment, ssh was performed with midgut cdna pools from cry1ca-sensitive and cry1ca-resistant 5th instar larvae, both raised on diet without toxin. thus two more pools of subtracted cdnas were obtained and cloned, one representing genes with comparatively higher expression in sensitive larva  and one with lower expression in sensitive larva  as compared to resistant larva.

from each of the four libraries  <dig> clones were randomly picked and sequenced. sequences were analyzed and overlapping or identical sequences were assembled into contigs. an in-depth analysis of the characterized sequences and the studies on the expression of the corresponding genes by microarray analysis will be published elsewhere. homology searches with contig sequences resulted in the identification of a number of contigs encoding peptides with high homology to known lepidopteran aminopeptidase n sequences and were selected for further studies.

in library  <dig>  we identified two single sequences of  <dig> and  <dig> base pairs, respectively. the first, designated contig  <dig> , encoded a peptide with high homology with lymantria dispar apn <dig>  amino acids  <dig> to  <dig> and almost equally high homology to a bombyx mori apn . the second, contig  <dig>  showed highest homology to spodoptera litura apn  amino acids  <dig> to  <dig> and to a lesser extent to a second b. mori apn . the fact that the two encoded peptides were overlapping but not entirely identical in the overlap region, and were homologous to two different b. mori apns, indicated that they might be fragments of two different apn cdnas.

in library  <dig>  we identified  <dig> contigs with homology to apns. contig  <dig>  consisted of  <dig> identical copies of a  <dig> base pair fragment, while contigs  <dig> and  <dig> consisted of single fragments of  <dig> and  <dig> bp, respectively. all three sequences encoded peptides with high homology to different parts of helicoverpa armigera apn <dig>   and to a lesser extent to a third b. mori apn . although the three peptides were not overlapping, the high homology to single respresentatives of the apns of h. armigera and b. mori indicated that they might be derived from one single s. exigua cdna, different from the two cdnas derived from library  <dig> 

overall results from ssh experiments provided the partial sequence of  <dig> different apns . since previous work  <cit>  suggested the presence of at least four different classes of apns in lepidoptera, a degenerate primer  based on the known sequences of apn class  <dig> of other lepidoptera was designed for the specific amplification of the s. exigua apn corresponding to class  <dig> in 3'race experiments. sequences obtained from 3'race were employed for the design of a primer for the 5' end fragment amplification .

aminopeptidase sequence analysis
using the primers described in table  <dig>  overlapping fragments from the 5'-and 3'-ends of the four apns were amplified by race, cloned in pgem-t easy and sequenced. open reading frames  of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> bp were obtained for apn <dig> , apn <dig> , apn <dig> , and apn <dig> , respectively . protein products of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> amino acids were predicted from the apn <dig>  apn <dig>  apn <dig>  and apn <dig> cdna sequences, respectively.

the predicted proteins were aligned using clustalx as described in material and methods . percentage of identity among the different apns ranged from  <dig>  between apn <dig> and apn <dig> to  <dig>  between apn <dig> and apn <dig>  analysis of the n-terminal region of the predicted proteins using the signalp program  <cit>  indicated the presence of a signal peptide sequence in all four apns . all four apns showed the presence of a zinc binding motif  and the gamen motif  characteristic of the gluzincin aminopeptidases and involved in their aminopeptidase activity  <cit> . analysis of the amino acid sequences using the gpi predictor server  <cit>  revealed the presence of a putative glycosylphosphatidylinositol -anchor site in the c-terminal end of all four aminopeptidases. the predicted gpi-modification sites were localized in the amino acid positions  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> .

one allele each from all of the lepidopteran apns deposited in genbank so far  were aligned together with these four s. exigua apn's using the clustalx program. phylogenetic tree construction showed that lepidopteran apns group in five subfamilies . alignment also shows that the four s. exigua apns reported here each represent one of the larger four groups. our apn <dig> is highly homologous to a s. exigua apn protein sequence deposited in genbank during the course of our studies . compared with the apn <dig> from the susceptible colony employed in this study, this apn showed  <dig> amino acid differences. although degenerate primers were designed for the race of a s. exigua cdna representative of the putative class  <dig>  we were not able to obtain an amplification product corresponding to such an apn <dig>  bootstrapping analysis was performed in order to test the robustness of the generated tree. bootstrap values of  <dig> were obtained for all the main branches except for the one corresponding to the class  <dig> apn. for this branch a bootstrap value of  <dig> was obtained, likely caused by the presence of the p. interpunctella apn . when this sequence was omitted from the alignment, bootstrap values of  <dig> were obtained for all the five branches.

apn expression analysis
the cdna fragments of apn <dig> and apn <dig> originated each as a single fragment from a library putatively representing genes that were up-regulated in response to toxin exposure. however, when we compared expression of these genes as well as of apn <dig> and apn <dig> between guts of larvae exposed or not exposed to cry1ca toxin, by northern blotting, we found no evidence for regulation of their expression by toxin exposure .

the three cdna contigs of apn <dig> were all derived from library  <dig>  putatively representing genes that are expressed at a higher level in sensitive larvae compared to in resistant larvae. this suggested that apn <dig> was not, or at a lower level, expressed in the resistant line. in order to determine differences in expression levels of the apns between the susceptible and resistant larvae, northern blot analysis was performed with total rna extracted from midguts of 5th instar larvae of both colonies. northern blot analysis showed that all four apns are expressed in susceptible larvae . in agreement with the ssh results, no expression of apn <dig> was detected in batches of rna from resistant larvae , while the other three apns were expressed at levels similar to that in susceptible larvae . similar results were obtained with different batches of rna  from the resistant insects and employing higher concentrations of rna or in rt-pcr experiments specific for apn <dig> , indicating that lack of apn <dig> expression is virtually complete in the resistant colony. since most bioassays and selections for resistance are performed with the more toxin-sensitive neonate larvae in stead of the 5th instar larvae used here, we also tested apn <dig> expression in  neonate larvae from the sensitive and resistant colonies. also here, apn <dig> expression was detectable in sensitive larvae, but not in resistant larvae .

discussion
based on the results from ssh experiments and in one case by using degenerate primers , sequences of four different apn cdnas from s. exigua have been determined. sequence analysis of the predicted proteins showed the common structural characteristics that other lepidopteran apns have, such as signal peptides, zinc binding sites, gamen motifs, and gpi-anchor sites. oltean et al.  <cit>  suggested the distribution of the different lepidopteran apns in at least  <dig> homology groups following phylogenetic analysis of the sequences. nakanishi et al.  <cit>  called these groups class  <dig> to  <dig>  currently, with the addition of new sequences to genbank, a new analysis clearly reveals the presence of at least five different classes of apns in lepidoptera. definition of the fifth class is not only supported by the phylogenetic analysis of the sequences but also by the presence of a sequence from helicoverpa armigera in all  <dig> branches . amplification of a s. exigua cdna representing class  <dig> was attempted without success. possible explanations could be that the degenerate primers used for the amplification of this apn were designed based on the consensus of only two sequences, and the selected primer sequences may not be conserved in a s. exigua apn <dig>  alternatively, s. exigua may not have a gene for the class  <dig> apn, or its expression in the midgut is too low to be picked up as cdna.

ssh comparison between the susceptible and the resistant colonies suggested a lower expression of apn <dig> in the resistant insects compared with the susceptible insects. this difference in the expression was confirmed by northern blot analysis , showing clearly the absence of expression of this apn in the resistant insects, both in 5th instar larvae as well as in neonate larvae. apn has been described, together with cadherin-like proteins, as one of the proteins involved in the binding of cry1a toxins to the midgut of several lepidopteran species  <cit> . recently new evidence of the importance of apns in the mode of action of bt toxins was obtained by transformation of drosophila melanogaster with the m. sexta class  <dig> apn . expression of this apn in the midgut of the d. melanogaster larvae increased the susceptibility of these insects to cry1ac toxin  <cit> .

in the case of cry1ca toxin, luo et al.  <cit>  using toxin affinity chromatography, detected and isolated a  <dig> kda apn from m. sexta that bound to cry1ca. although the entire sequence of this  <dig> kda apn has not been published, its n-terminal sequence is nearly identical  to the sequence of the published m. sexta class  <dig> apn   <cit>  and   <cit> , and much more different from the m. sexta class  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> apns. this strongly suggests that at least one of the m. sexta cry1ca-binding proteins is a class  <dig> apn.

agrawal et al.  <cit>  cloned a spodoptera litura class  <dig> apn cdna, slapn , and expressed it in insect cells, detecting binding of cry1ca toxin to the surface of the cells expressing this apn. more recent results showed that silencing of the expression of the slapn in s. litura by rna interference  through injection of a  <dig> bp dsrna fragment, reduced the susceptibility of these insects to cry1ca  <cit> .

so far, only one fully characterized gene has been associated with the development of resistance to bt toxins in lepidoptera. gahan et al.  <cit>  studied the heliothis virescens yhd <dig> resistant strain and detected a strong linkage between the resistance to cry1ac toxin and the disruption of a cadherin gene. unfortunately, since our s. exigua resistant line was lost during the development of this research, analysis of linkage between the resistance to cry1ca and the lack of apn <dig> expression could not be performed.

data from ssh with resistant vs susceptible insects, support a possible role of the apns in the mode of action of bt toxins in lepidoptera. previous binding studies with the resistant line employed here, showed a 5-fold decrease in the binding affinity of cry1ca toxin to brush border membrane vesicles prepared with midguts from the resistant line. all these data together with previous work supporting the binding of cry1ca toxins to apn either in m. sexta or s. litura, strongly support the notion that lack of apn <dig> in s. exigua is responsible, at least in part, for resistance to cry1ca in this resistant line. future work on the possible role of the apn in toxin binding, including heterologous expression or down-regulation by rna interference strategies may further support this role.

CONCLUSIONS
we have cloned and characterized four different midgut cdnas from s. exigua, representing  <dig> out of  <dig> putative classes of lepidopteran apns and have shown that one of these was not expressed in the larvae of a cry1ca-resistant colony. combined with other evidence of the importance of apn in the mode of action of b. thuringiensis toxins these results suggest that the lack of apn <dig> expression plays a role in the resistance to cry1ca in this s. exigua colony.
