BACKGROUND
molecular cell biology experimentation often requires the culture of primary cells or immortalized cell lines. the most common substratum used in cell culture consists of a plastic dish that offers a negatively charged surface. a drawback of this technology is that some anchorage-dependent cell types do not produce sufficient amounts of positively charged extracellular matrix proteins, adhering only weakly to the plastic substratum. pre-coating of the plastic surface with extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen, fibronectin, laminin, etc., usually enhances the attachment of these cell types  <cit> . synthetic polymeric cations such as polylysine or polyornithine have also been used as attachment promoting factors in numerous studies  <cit> .

polyethyleneimine  is an organic polymer that has a high density of amino groups that can be protonated. at physiological ph, the polycation is very effective in binding to dna and can mediate the transfection of eukaryotic cells  <cit> . the original pei-based protocol has been used in our laboratory successfully for transfections with hek- <dig>  and pc- <dig>  cells. however, lipofection using some of the last generation cationinc lipids, lipofectamine- <dig> or lipofectamine-plus , yielded higher efficiencies of gene delivery, particularly with pc- <dig> cells . several modifications of the original pei-based protocol have been described that improve the efficiency of transfection significantly, rivaling the lipofection protocols  <cit> , but they have not been attempted yet in our laboratory. a notable difference, related to the attachment of the cells to the substratum, was observed during the transfection experiments. whenever the cells were transfected by the original pei-based protocol, the cells remained firmly anchored to the plates throughout histochemical procedures. hek- <dig> and pc- <dig> cells are considered weakly anchoring cells  <cit> , and many were detached from the plates during histochemical stainings of cells transfected by lipofection. this initial observation prompted us to study the attachment-enhancing properties of pei and its effects on lipofection of eukaryotic cells. pei has been used previously to coat surfaces to promote the attachment of neurons in primary cell cultures  <cit> . a modified version of pei that incorporates hydrophobic groups was demonstrated to be highly effective in the attachment of several cell lines, allowing differentiation of neurons and preventing cell loses during multiple washing steps  <cit> .

this report presents a comparison of pei with other traditional coating agents as attachment factors for several cell lines and primary cultures of retina tissue. additionally, an enhancement of the transfection yield of weakly anchoring cell lines is shown by the combination of pei coating with lipofection.

RESULTS
pei promotes the attachment of weakly anchoring cells and primary tissues
pc- <dig> cells are used as a model of neuronal differentiation in the laboratory, as treatment of these cells with nerve growth factor  induces neurite extension and the expression of biochemical markers of the sympathetic neuronal phenotype  <cit> . they grow as weakly anchoring cells and collagen or polylysine polymers are frequently used for pre-coating plates for pc- <dig> cell culture  <cit> . pc- <dig> cells were cultured in the laboratory in naive wells or in wells pre-coated with diverse attachment factors , to observe the effect on the anchorage of the cells to the substratum. in the absence of any coating agent, the cells showed a characteristic tendency to form clusters of cells that accumulate towards the center of the well; these cells are firmly attached among themselves, but very weakly attached to the tissue culture dish . this results in a very heterogeneous distribution of cells  and significant loss of cells during washing procedures or changes of medium. pretreatment of the plates with pei resulted in a significantly more homogeneous distribution of cells in the well, with cells attaching to the plate firmly, showing a much lower tendency to clustering . for comparison, plates were also pretreated with other commonly used coating agents, collagen  and poly-d-lysine , resulting also in firmer attachment of the cells to the plates and a more homogeneous distribution of cells.

to test further the anchoring enhancement property observed with the pei pretreatment of the culture dishes, a second system was utilized. retinal explants from teleost fish have been used in the study of nerve regeneration  <cit> . when a lesion is applied to the optic nerve of the fish, a regeneration response is initiated and the retinal ganglion cells  of the retina re-extend their axon towards the tectal target tissue. if the retina from such a "primed" fish is explanted and cultured, the regeneration response is observed in vitro by the accelerated extension of long neurites. however, this phenomenon requires the use of extracellular matrix or attachment factors , as the explants show very low affinity for the uncoated plastic surface. experiments were conducted to observe if pei could act as an attachment factor conducive to axonal outgrowth from zebrafish retinal explants. retinal explants from control zebrafish eyes were able to attach to pei-pretreated culture dishes . furthermore, retinal explants from fish that received a conditioning lesion were able to extend axons vigorously when cultured using pei as attachment factor .

the results with the retina explants suggested that neuronal cells attached to pei-coated dishes can differentiate, generating neurites that attach well to the substrate. to test this hypothesis with the pro-neuronal pc- <dig> cells, differentiation experiments by ngf treatment were performed with cells attached to dishes coated with pei. the pc- <dig> cells treated with ngf remained firmly attached to the plate over several days, generating networks of neurites . the results indicate that pei is permissive for the differentiation process and for the attachment of the neurites to the dish. the differentiated cells remained firmly anchored throughout immunocytochemistry experiments .

strength of anchoring of eukaryotic cells to culture dishes pretreated with pei and other attachment factors
three different cell lines were selected to test the ability of pei to promote strong anchoring to plastic culture dishes. pc- <dig> and hek- <dig> cells have been described above as weakly anchoring. on the other hand, mys cells are primary fibroblasts that adhere strongly to plastic culture dishes, growing to form a monolayer of cells on the surface. to test the strength of anchoring of the diverse cells to plates, a protocol was performed in which  <dig> consecutive washes with isotonic buffer were performed, followed by the use of a colorimetric protocol for counting the cells that remained in the plate . plates pretreated with the diverse attachment factors were compared with plates that received no pretreatment . experiments were performed in triplicate, and the averages of dye retained in the plates that received each treatment were calculated. those averages were normalized to the average obtained with the pei pretreatment, which was assigned the arbitrary value of  <dig> % in all the experiments. the results from representative experiments with the  <dig> cell lines are shown in figure  <dig> . pc- <dig> cells attached almost equally well to plates coated with pei, collagen or pdl . however, a significant loss of cells was observed when comparing untreated plates with pei-pretreated plates, with a relative cell count of  <dig> % ±  <dig> % . in the case of hek- <dig>  the cells attached strongly to both pei- and pdl-pretreated wells. in the representative experiment shown in figure 3b, the relative counts with those two treatments were  <dig> % ±  <dig> % and  <dig> % ±  <dig> % respectively. however, a large number of cells were lost when plated in the untreated wells , or in the wells that were pretreated with collagen , suggesting that these cells attach fairly loosely to plastic or to collagen-coated wells. finally, when the fibroblast cells  were utilized, the cells seemed to attach rather well to all four surfaces, including to the untreated wells . figure 3c shows a representative plot, displaying relative mys cell counts of  <dig> % ±  <dig> %,  <dig> % ±  <dig> %,  <dig> % ±  <dig> %, and  <dig> % ±  <dig> %, with wells pretreated with pei, collagen, or pdl, or untreated wells respectively. this cell line therefore attaches fairly well to the untreated plastic surface comparatively to the pc- <dig> and hek- <dig> cell lines.

to provide an indication of the variation among experiments, the averages ± standard deviations of the relative cell counts obtained in the independent experiments were calculated for each cell line and treatment . the comparative results for the other treatments are indicated below. for the pc- <dig> cells, the relative counts were  <dig> % ±  <dig> % for collagen-pretreated wells ,  <dig> % ±  <dig> % for pdl-pretreated wells , and  <dig> % ±  <dig> % for untreated wells . for the hek- <dig> cells, the relative counts were  <dig> % ±  <dig> % for collagen-pretreated wells ,  <dig> % ±  <dig> % for pdl-pretreated wells , and  <dig> % ±  <dig> % for untreated wells . in the experiments with mys cells, the average of the relative counts with collagen-pretreated wells was  <dig> % ±  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ±  <dig> % for pdl-pretreated wells , and  <dig> % ±  <dig> % for untreated wells . statistical analysis indicates that the enhancement of adhesion of both pc- <dig> and hek- <dig> cells to pei-pretreated dishes versus untreated plastic is significant , while it is not statistically significant for mys cells .

to further characterize the properties of pei as an attachment factor for weakly anchoring cells, experiments were carried out to analyze the dosage of pei that can provide optimal cell anchoring, the range of cell numbers that can benefit from the presence of pei, and the stability of pei as attachment factor. figure 4a shows the results from a representative experiment testing the strength of attachment of hek- <dig> cells to dishes coated with various doses of pei. the cell counts were normalized to the value obtained for the treatment with  <dig> μg/ml of pei, which was set at  <dig> %. the results indicate that concentrations of pei of  <dig>  μg/ml or higher resulted in maximal attachment enhancement, suggesting that the surface of the plastic dish is fully coated with the polymer at these concentrations. the higher concentrations of the polymer did not seem to have toxic effects on the cells if the excess of pei remaining in solution was removed thoroughly . the experiment shown is representative of  <dig> independent experiments. figure 4b represents the results obtained with various numbers of pc- <dig> and hek- <dig> cells. the figure shows relative cell counts, where an arbitrary value of  <dig> % was assigned to the average count obtained from the pei-treated wells with the highest number of each cell line . the results indicate that pei worked well as an attachment factor over a wide range of cell numbers for both pc- <dig> and hek- <dig> cells. lower cell numbers could not be tested reliably because they were close to the limit of sensitivity of the neutral red assay. the results shown are representative of at least  <dig> independent experiments performed with each cell line. figure 4c shows the results of an experiment conducted to test the stability of pei as an attachment factor. in this experiment, a set of plates were treated with pei and then kept in pbs at 4°c for  <dig> days. in a second test, plates were treated with pei and kept  in the 37°c co <dig> incubator for  <dig> days, with a medium change performed every  <dig> h. the performance of pei in these plates was then compared with plates treated with pei using the standard protocol described for previous experiments. the results show relative cell counts normalized to the average of the absorbances obtained with the standard pei-treated plates, which was given the arbitrary value of  <dig> %. the results indicate that the pei coating remains stable on the surface of the plastic dish for at least  <dig> days of refrigeration, and that it is not removed by incubation at 37°c in medium or even by repeated medium changes. results are representative of  <dig> independent experiments performed in triplicate.

pei pretreatment enhances lipofection of weakly anchoring cells
transfection of eukaryotic cells by lipofection involves several steps, media additions and replacements, which can take a toll in weakly anchoring cells. even if care is practiced to avoid cell loses, the weakly anchored cells may be less efficient in the uptake of the transfection complexes. since pei pretreatment of cell culture dishes increased the strength of attachment of cells to such surfaces, it was hypothesized that the attachment factor may have a positive effect in transfection yields obtained by lipofection. the three cell lines described above were used to test this hypothesis utilizing the coating agents previously examined. transfections were performed with a plasmid encoding the reporter enzyme β-galactosidase. the transfection yield was monitored by determination of reporter enzyme activity in lysates from the transfected cells. at least two independent assays in triplicate were performed with each cell line. representative plots are shown in figure  <dig>  the yields  were normalized to the activity obtained with pei pre-coating, which was set as a reference at  <dig> %. generally, it was observed that the transfection yields were improved in the weakly anchoring cells by the pre-coating with agents that promote cell attachment to the plate. in the case of pc- <dig> cells, pre-coating of wells with pei, collagen or pdl resulted in a 2- to 3-fold enhancement of transfection yield related to the untreated wells: relative yields of  <dig> % ±  <dig> % for pei,  <dig> % ±  <dig> % for collagen, and  <dig> % ±  <dig> % for pdl, versus  <dig> % ±  <dig> % for the untreated wells . the improvement of transfection yield by pei pretreatment was more pronounced for hek- <dig> cells. the experiment in figure 5b shows a relative activity of  <dig> % ±  <dig> % for the cells in the untreated wells, when compared with  <dig> % ±  <dig> % for the pei-pretreated wells . pretreatment with collagen or pdl resulted in more modest inductions . the lowest improvement was observed with collagen, similarly to the lower enhancement of attachment of hek- <dig> cells that was previously observed in figure 3b. finally, for the strongly attaching mys fibroblasts, there was not a significant positive effect observed by using attachment factors in the transfection procedure. variations were usually less than 20% for all the experimental conditions. the representative experiment shown in figure 5c in fact shows a slightly higher transfection yield for the untreated wells than for the pei-pretreated plates .

compiling the results from all the experiments performed, the average fold-induction  observed in the transfection yield of pc- <dig> cells anchored to pei as compared with cells on untreated wells was  <dig> -fold , while the enhancement with hek- <dig> cells was  <dig> -fold . t-test statistical analysis indicates that both increases are significant . no significant transfection enhancement was observed in the experiments with mys cells, with an average fold-change of  <dig> -fold  by the pretreatment with pei .

discussion
while some cell lines are able to produce extracellular matrix components in sufficient quantities to allow them to attach well to plastic culture dishes, some others have a more limited capacity, resulting in cells that are loosely attached to the dish. natural extracellular matrix factors such as collagen, laminin, fibronectin, etc., can be utilized in the culture of these cells  <cit>  and in the performance of multiple laboratory procedures that require the cells to remain attached to the culture vessel, for example immunocytochemical procedures. other more economical alternatives have been developed, such as the use of polylysine or polyornithine  <cit> . a much less utilized polymer, pei, offers a successful alternative. the most economical of all the mentioned factors, pei seems to perform the task of attachment factor efficiently with primary neurons , and with weakly anchoring cell lines . the pei solution is very easy to prepare, it can be frozen for several months without any loss of activity, and remains active on the plastic surface for numerous days after the treatment . the anchoring effect of pei seemed to work well for a wide range of cell numbers for both pc- <dig> and hek- <dig> cells . pei was efficient with high numbers of pc- <dig> cells probably by preventing cell-cell interactions , favoring instead the attachment to the dish surface. pei worked well with hek- <dig> cells in the range of  <dig> ×  <dig> to  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells per well. when larger numbers of hek- <dig> cells were utilized the results were more variable, suggesting that when these cells are near confluency they may be able to form monolayers that attach more firmly to the plate, however further experiments are necessary to study this hypothesis. the effects of pei and the other cationic attachment factors on pc- <dig> and hek- <dig> cells suggest that these cells have a limited capacity to produce an effective extracellular matrix to allow them to attach to the plastic surface, resulting in weak anchoring to the dishes on their own. cationic polymers such as pei and pdl seem to work very effectively to coat the surface of the dish and substitute for the absence of the extracellular matrix components. on the other hand, fibroblast cells  are very efficient producing extracellular matrix proteins, which allows them to attach firmly to the culture dishes, therefore no benefit was observed by the use of attachment factors with these cells .

lipofection is an efficient transfection procedure that requires culture dish manipulations and media changes. this fact causes difficulties when using cells that are not well anchored to the culture dish. the experiments presented support the idea that attachment factors can enhance the yield of lipofection of weakly anchoring cells. pei provided very good results with pc- <dig> and hek- <dig> cells, while the other factors tested showed more specific and limited effects . based on the results regarding the anchoring promotion effect of pei and the other factors, it is likely that the increases in the yields of β-galactosidase observed are due to a larger number of cells remaining in the dishes that were treated with attachment factors. however, the transfection procedures were performed trying to minimize the cell loses, therefore it is also possible that part of the effect observed could be derived from a higher transfection efficiency of the cells that are more firmly attached versus the cells that are loosely attached or forming clusters. cells in suspension are often harder to transfect than cells anchored to the substratum  <cit> . preliminary experiments in which the transfection yield was normalized to the amount of protein in the lysate suggested that the increased yield is due primarily to the larger number of cells rather than an increase in efficiency . future experiments will analyze these possibilities in more detail. in any case, the pei pretreatment offers additional advantages, for example the firmly attached cells can be used in immunocytochemical and immunofluorescence analysis with great ease and virtually no cell loss . most protocols of transfection of pc- <dig> cells suggest the use of an attachment factor, however this is usually not the case for protocols involving the widely used hek- <dig> cells  <cit> . our experiments suggest that pretreatment of culture surfaces with pei is advantageous in lipofection protocols with both cell lines.

CONCLUSIONS
pei is used frequently as a transfection reagent. a second application of this reagent as an attachment factor is much less recognized. a comparison of pei with two very commonly used attachment factors for cell and tissue culture showed that pei is highly efficient and convenient. two commonly used cell lines, pc- <dig> and hek- <dig>  attached firmly to plastic dishes coated with pei. although the anchoring properties of pei had been previously recognized, its use with these two cell lines had not been characterized in detail in comparison with other frequently used coating agents. pei will likely work with a variety of weakly anchoring cells, for example pei was shown to be effective with primary retinal explants in this report. additionally, the results presented indicate that the use of coating agents can enhance lipofection protocols. cell culture and transfection protocols using pc- <dig> cells frequently involve the use of coating agents , but this is not so for protocols with hek- <dig> cells. pei was very effective in improving lipofection protocols with both cell lines. the firm attachment afforded by pei allowed transfections with cationic lipids  to provide higher yields and more consistent results.
