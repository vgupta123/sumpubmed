BACKGROUND
serine proteases  represent a very diverse group of proteolytic enzymes involved in digestion, development, and innate immunity . x-ray crystal structural examination suggests that sps possess a catalytic triad, consisting of his, asp, and ser amino acid residues  <cit> , frequently embedded in the conserved sequences of taahc, dial, and gdsggp, respectively  <cit> . sps commonly take the form of inactive pro-enzymes and require a specific and limited proteolytic cleavage for activation in a cascade pathway  <cit> . extracellular serine proteinase cascades have evolved in invertebrates  <cit>  to play critical roles in embryonic development and innate immunity  <cit>  to mediate fast responses to infection and wounding  <cit> . a classical characteristic of these enzymes is that they have clip domain at the amino terminus. clip domains contain six conserved cys residues with cys- <dig> and cys- <dig> at adjacent positions, forming three disulfide bonds  <cit> . they may be involved in mediating protein-protein interactions or for regulating cascades of sp activities  <cit> .

serine protease homologs  are also members of the sp family  <cit>  and have similar sequences to sps, with the exception of mutations or absence of the catalytic residues, resulting in loss of catalytic function  <cit> . the roles of sphs have been extensively studied in invertebrates. for example, sphs are indispensable for activation of prophenoloxidase  in manduca sexta  . sphs are also involved in somatic muscle attachment in drosophila  embryos, regulation of complement recruitment to microbial surfaces in anopheles gambiae , cell adhesion in pacifastacus leniusculus  and immune defense against bacterial infection in scylla paramamosain  .

development of dna sequencing technologies has enabled whole-genome investigation of the sp and sph genes in drosophila melanogaster, apis mellifera , bombyx mori  and nilaparvata lugens   <cit> . further, immunity-related sps and sphs have been reported in a. gambiae, a. mellifera, tribolium castaneum  and b. mori . research of sps and sphs in these insect species has provided an overview of roles in triggering immunity responses.

the diamondback moth , plutella xylostella  , is a devastating pest of cruciferous crops, costing an estimated $4– <dig> billion per annum around the world  <cit> . populations of p. xylostella have been shown to commonly develop resistance to insecticides, including those based on the bacterium bacillus thuringiensis , making it difficult to control  <cit> . although the genome has been sequenced, and our recent work has identified  <dig> immune-related genes in p. xylostella immune system  <cit> , the roles of sps and sphs in p. xylostella immunity and other physiological processes are not well understood. only seven sps have been reported with one chymotrypsin and three trypsins being cloned and downregulated in p. xylostella parasitized by cotesia vestalis  <cit> , and three clip serine proteases being identified and found to be associated with immunity  <cit> .

in the present work, we identified and characterized the sp and sph genes, and profiled their expression patterns in different life stages and tissues based on the p. xylostella genome , rna-seq data and qpcr analysis. our findings provide a foundation for further studies on biological functions of this gene family in p. xylostella, particularly associated with digestion, development and immunity.

RESULTS
identification and characterization of the p. xylostella sps and sphs
a total of  <dig> putative p. xylostella sps and sphs  were identified in the p. xylostella genome . the protein sequences of  <dig> sp/sph genes are provided in additional file 2: table s <dig>  based on the merops process, the results showed that the majority of sps/sphs were significantly similar to the chymotrypsin  family. among the sp/sph genes recognized,  <dig> were documented in  <dig> when the p. xylostella genome was published  <cit> . the number of sp/sph genes in p. xylostella is less than that in a. gambiae   <cit> , similar to that in d. melanogaster   <cit> , but greater than that in b. mori   <cit> , n. lugens   <cit>  and a. mellifera   <cit> .

according to the presence or absence of the catalytic triad, the  <dig> putative sp/sph genes in p. xylostella were divided into  <dig> sp and  <dig> sph genes . of  <dig> pxsps,  <dig>  contained an intact trypsin-like serine protease catalytic triad  domain with the catalytic triad, while some had additional tryp_spc domains or other modules, including clip domain, low-density lipoprotein receptor class a  domain, frizzled  domain and scavenger receptor cys-rich  domain . aside from three sphs  with an additional domain  , the remaining sphs had only the tryp_spc domain with one or more active sites replaced by other amino acid residues.

the  <dig> sp and sph genes were spread across  <dig> different scaffolds , and  <dig> sp/sph genes were predicted to be tandem duplications and located on  <dig> different scaffolds forming  <dig> clusters, each of which containing two or more  <dig> genes . eleven sp/sph genes forming two clusters were located on scaffold  <dig>  eight on scaffold  <dig>  and seven on scaffolds  <dig> and  <dig> . similarly, large clusters of sp/sph genes have been identified in the genomes of several species, such as d. melanogaster, b. mori, n. lugens and a. gambiae, representing different insect orders  <cit> . gene duplication and unequal crossing-over may be crucial mechanisms for production of large clusters  <cit> . it has also been suggested that large clusters of the sp and sph genes from b. mori are tandem repeats  <cit> . full chromosomal scaffolding information of p. xylostella will contribute to investigation of the pxsp and pxsph duplication events, providing information on the evolution of this gene family. based on the different functions of sps and sphs, sp/sph genes were roughly classified into three major clades: 1) trypsin and chymotrypsin, 2) clip-domain sp/sph and, 3) other sp/sph genes.

trypsin and chymotrypsin genes
from the p. xylostella genome, we recognized  <dig> trypsin and  <dig> chymotrypsin genes . both trypsin and chymotrypsin genes contain a relatively simple structure  with the catalytic triad that characterizes all serine proteinases, and a typical substrate-binding pocket  <cit> . trypsin and chymotrypsin are well-studied serine proteases, playing vital roles in the digestion of proteins  <cit> , as well as in the modulation of toxicity of bt toxins  <cit> .

the  <dig> trypsin genes were unevenly distributed among  <dig> different scaffolds . for example, scaffolds  <dig> and  <dig> had the largest trypsin clusters with five genes on each. scaffolds  <dig> and  <dig> had four genes on each, while  <dig> scaffolds had only one gene each. twenty trypsin genes formed  <dig> clusters on  <dig> scaffolds, which accounted for  <dig>  % of all trypsin genes , and genes in each cluster were predicted to be tandem duplications. more specifically, pxtrys 8– <dig> had a high level of sequence similarity  and contained the same number of exons and intron phases  . the distances between pxtry <dig> and pxt ry <dig> as well as pxtry <dig> and pxtry <dig> are the same and only 2 kb . pxtrys 18– <dig> were on scaffold  <dig> with the same orientation and  <dig>  % of the sequence similarity, and composed of the same number of exons and intron phases  . pxtrys 29– <dig> were on scaffold  <dig> with the same orientation, and shared  <dig>  % of the sequence similarity and the same number of exons and intron phases  . overall these results indicate that trypsin genes probably evolved from duplication events, like in d. melanogaster and n. lugens  <cit> . the reasons for trypsins to duplicate in herbivorous insects remain unclear but two hypotheses have been proposed: a) increased expression of inhibitor-insensitive protease isoforms  <cit> , and b) formation of a complex digestive system that provides an efficient mechanism for protein degradation  <cit> .fig.  <dig> scaffold localization and gene structure of p. xylostella trypsin genes.  the four scaffolds with ≥ four trypsin genes. genes names and the distance of two adjacent genes  are showed on the right and left of the bar, respectively. scaffold numbers are presented at the top of each bar.  gene structure of the p. xylostella trypsins located on the four scaffolds was shown in fig. 1a. values  above each of the black lines indicate the intron phase. the scale line at the bottom shows the length of each gene



multiple sequence alignment of p. xylostella trypsins along with well annotated trypsins, aedes aegypti trypsin 3a <dig> , a. gambie trypsin- <dig> , and culex quinquefasciatus trypsin <dig>  and trypsin <dig> , showed that p. xylostella trypsins shared features/domains with trypsins identified in other invertebrates . as previously mentioned, they had the three motifs  as well as six cysteine  residues at conserved positions, and putative autocatalytic activation motifs. thirty-eight putative p. xylostella trypsins had the characteristic asp in the s <dig> pocket. however, some of the trypsins found in this study had other distinct characteristics. for instance, instead of arg/lys  residues, the autocatalytic motif of pxtry <dig>  pxtry <dig>  and pxtry <dig> had a tyr , phe , and y residues, respectively. this could indicate that they might be specific signals for activation. moreover, the activation motif of pxtry <dig>  pxtry <dig>  pxtry <dig>  and pxtry <dig> was iigg, and iing for pxtry <dig> and pxtry <dig>  different from the typical motif sequence   <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis of trypsin genes showed that p. xylostella trypsins were clustered into three clades  . clade i contained  <dig> p. xylostella trypsin genes, which were clustered with those in c. quinquefasciatus and n. lugens. in this clade, cqtrys  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> have been reported to be constitutively expressed in the midgut of females, indicating their potential roles in digestion  <cit> . nltry <dig> and nltry <dig> are highly expressed in the midgut  <cit> . six d. melanogaster trypins, which were part of this clade i, have been documented to play an important role in digestion  <cit> .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic relationship of trypsins in p. xylostella and other insect species. the phylogenetic tree was constructed using mega  <dig>  with neighbor joining approach based on poisson model and pairwise deletion of gaps. the percentage bootstrap scores higher than 50 % are indicated on the nodes. the first two letters in each of the gene names represent the acronym of scientific name for a given species . p. xylostella trypsins are marked with red dots



clade ii contained eight p. xylostella trypsins, all of which were clustered together in a single branch. we predicted that pxtrys 34– <dig> were tandem duplications. in helicoverpa armigera, hatry <dig> is highly expressed in the larvae  <cit> . in o. nubilalis, ontrys  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are highly expressed in the midgut and hindgut  <cit> . clade iii contained  <dig> p. xylostella trypsins. as suggested by scaffold results, pxtrys 4– <dig>  pxtrys 8– <dig>  pxtrys 18– <dig> and pxtrys 29– <dig> were predicted to be tandem duplications. ontrys 4– <dig> and  <dig> have been found to be up-regulated in o. nubilalis larvae after feeding on cry1ab protoxin  <cit> . cry1ab protoxin is one of the cry toxins produced by the bacterium b. thuringiensis, which is used in biological insecticides applied to control pest insects in the fields  <cit> .

the putative chymotrypsins have typical conserved sequence motifs, n-terminal putative activation residues  for cleavage and three catalytic triad residues . however, pxchy <dig> had other distinct characteristic with tyr  instead of arg/lys  residues, suggesting a different specific signal for activation . the substrate binding pocket in chymotrypsins was relatively diverse, and pxchy <dig> and pxchy <dig> had the characteristic ser in the s <dig> pocket, with the remaining being an ala/ser or gly/ser substituted in the s <dig> pocket. the gly/ser substitution in the s <dig> pocket has been found in o. nubilalis  <cit> , and has presumably minor effects on substrate interactions.

phylogenetic analysis of chymotrypsin genes showed that pxchy <dig> and pxchy <dig> were grouped with onchy <dig> and onchy <dig> . in o. nubilalis, the expression of onchy <dig> is too low to be detected by rt-pcr, but onchy <dig> is expressed in the foregut and midgut  <cit> . pxchys 4– <dig> were clustered with the genes in o. nubilalis  and h. armigera , with a relatively high level of similarity  among them. onchy <dig> and onchy <dig> are expressed only in the foregut and midgut, while onchy <dig> is expressed in all three gut sections . onchy <dig> is significantly up-regulated after a 24-h exposure to cry1ab, suggesting that it may be conducive to the degradation of activated cry1ab toxin in o. nubilalis  <cit> .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic relationship of chymotrypsins in p. xylostella and other lepidoptera species. the phylogenetic tree was constructed using mega  <dig>  with neighbor joining approach based on poisson model and pairwise deletion of gaps. the percentage bootstrap scores higher than 50 % are indicated on the nodes. the first two letters in each of the gene names represent the acronym of scientific name for a given species . p. xylostella chymotrypsins are marked with red dots



clip-domain sp/sph genes
in this study,  <dig> pxclips were predicted in p. xylostella , which is close to the  <dig> serine proteases and their homologs linked to the clip-domain in m. sexta  <cit> ,  <dig> in b. mori  <cit>  and a. mellifera  <cit> , but fewer than the  <dig> in d. melanogaster  <cit>  and  <dig> in a. gambiae  <cit> . among the  <dig> pxclips, pxclip <dig> contained two clip domains, for a total of  <dig> clip domains detected, suggesting its potential function as a propo-activating enzyme as reported in the other lepidoptera such as m. sexta  <cit>  and b. mori  <cit> .

the number of residues between cys- <dig> and cys- <dig> varied from  <dig> to  <dig> , which was consistent with the range of clip domains previously documented in insects, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> residues  <cit> . the number of residues between cys- <dig> and cys- <dig> varied from two to ten, but was constant between cys- <dig> and cys- <dig> with five residues in all the clip domains . clip domains are usually divided into two groups depending on the number of residues between cys- <dig> and cys- <dig>  with group  <dig> clip domain having 8- <dig> residues and group  <dig> having 22– <dig> residues  <cit> . five clip domains in pxclips  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> contained 14– <dig> residues between cys- <dig> and cys- <dig>  indicating that they were of group  <dig>  whereas the remaining clip domains had 22– <dig> residues in this region and were of group  <dig>  previous research indicates that terminal proteinases have either an arg or lys residue at their activation sites that are replaced by leu, his or ser in penultimate proteinases  <cit> . the predicted proteolytic activation sites of  <dig> pxclips showed that pxclips  <dig>  4– <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> either had an arg or lys residue but pxclip <dig> had another residue at its activation site . we therefore propose that pxclips  <dig>  4– <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are terminal proteinases in the cascade pathway, while the pxclip <dig> may belong to penultimate proteinases.

the phylogenetic tree including p. xylostella, b. mori, m. sexta, d. melanogaster, and a. mellifera clip-domain sps/sphs showed that seven of  <dig> pxclips were clustered together with those of two lepidoptera species b. mori and m. sexta . for instance, pxclip <dig> was grouped with mspap <dig>  and pxclip <dig> was homologous to mspap <dig> and bmsph <dig>  in m. sexta, pap <dig>  and pap <dig> , containing a group  <dig> clip domain, are terminal proteinases in the cascade pathway and known to be involved in propo cleavage and activation  <cit> . in b. mori, bmsph <dig> contains a group  <dig> clip domain and is markedly up-regulated after induction, suggesting that it may have a similar function to its tobacco hornworm homolog mspap <dig>  <cit> . pxclip <dig> and pxclip <dig> consisted of a group  <dig> clip domain and were also terminal proteinases, which have been reported and named pxpapa  and pxpapb   <cit> . mshp <dig>  a hemolymph proteinase of m. sexta with a group  <dig> clip domain, is a penultimate proteinase in two different immune pathways, leading to activation of propo and the melanization response, and activation of hemolymph proteinase  <dig> , which stimulates a toll-like pathway  <cit> . pxclip <dig> was considered homologous to bm_xp_ <dig> and mshp <dig>  implying that pxclip <dig> could have similar biological functions. pxclip <dig> and pxclip <dig> were clustered with bmsph <dig>  mshp <dig> and amcsp <dig> , with a high level of similarity  among them. bmsph <dig> contains a group  <dig> clip domain, which has been suggested to participate in pathogenic microorganism resistance in b. mori  <cit> . in m. sexta, the expression of mshp <dig>  is not detectable in hemocytes or fat body, however, it is produced in both tissues after the microbial infection  <cit> . pxclip <dig> was clustered with bm_xp_ <dig> and dmcg <dig> , but the functions of these two clip serine proteases were unclear. however, pxclip <dig> was grouped with dmpersephone and dmcg <dig>  in d. melanogaster, persephone serves in the toll pathway, which can be activated by fungal and bacterial proteinases  <cit> . dmcg <dig> is involved in systemic wound response, which is required for host protection against wounds and upregulated in response to septic infection in a toll- and imd-dependent manner  <cit> .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic relationship of clips in p. xylostella and other four insect species. the phylogenetic tree was constructed using mega  <dig>  with neighbor joining approach based on poisson model and pairwise deletion of gaps. the percentage bootstrap scores higher than 50 % are indicated on the nodes. the first two letters in each of the gene names represent the acronym of scientific name for a given species . p. xylostella clips are marked with red triangles



other sp/sph genes
previous research has indicated that nudel and gastrulation defective  are the key components of dorso-ventral axis establishment in the drosophila embryo  <cit> . the toll-dorsal pathway is also conducive to other processes including immunity, morphogenetic movements and muscle development at later developmental stages  <cit> . stubble has a type ii transmembrane domain, which is indispensable for leg and wing morphogenesis  <cit> . nudel, gd and stubble genes from d. melanogaster were used to search for the same sequences in the p. xylostella genome, and one nudel, one gd and eight stubble-like genes were predicted in p. xylostella .

the pxnudel gene  was composed of a similar structure to dmnudel, including a transmembrane region, eight intact ldla repeats and two tryp_spc domains . multiple sequence alignment showed that p. xylostella nudel and other lepidoptera nudels contained eight ldla domains, three conserved motifs and putative activation residues , with a 42 % level of identity among them. phylogenetic analysis indicated that pxnudel was more closely clustered with lepidoptera nudels  and diptera nudels , rather than those in the other three insect species  . the pxgd gene  encompassed both a signal peptide and a tryp_spc domain , which was most closely related to the counterpart of b. mori . however,multiple sequence alignments showed a low sequence similarity with the gds of other species . future experiments are needed to test whether pxgd is involved in early embryonic development. p. xylostella stubble-like proteins lacked the transmembrane domains found in the d. melanogaster stubble, but phylogenetic analysis showed that these genes were homologous to those of b. mori, musca domestica, a. pisum and bombus terrestris . eight stubble-like genes in p. xylostella were predicted, while five were identified in n. lugens and only one in d. melanogaster, implying that the abundant stubble-like genes might be involved in some physiological processes.fig.  <dig> domain architecture  and phylogenetic analysis of nudel  and gastrulation defective   using mega  <dig>  with neighbor joining approach based on poisson model and pairwise deletion of gaps. the sequences used for phylogenetic analysis of the nudel gene in p. xylostella and other seven insect species were obtained from genbank  with accession numbers: px <dig> , xp_ <dig> , xp_ <dig> , np_ <dig> , xp_ <dig> , xp_ <dig> , xp_ <dig>  and xp_ <dig> . the sequences used for phylogenetic analysis of the gd gene in p. xylostella and other seven insect species were obtained from genbank  with accession numbers: px <dig> , kj <dig> , xp_ <dig> , xp_ <dig> , xp_ <dig> , xp_ <dig> , xp_ <dig>  and np_ <dig> . p. xylostella nudel and gd are marked with red dots



expression profiling of the pxsps and pxsphs
stage-specific expression profiling
expression of the  <dig> pxsp and pxsph genes was profiled using rna-seq data from the different developmental stages of the insecticide-susceptible strain  including eggs, larvae, pupae and adults. the hierarchical clustering was used to describe the various relative levels of expression of sp and sph genes, which could be differentiated into three distinct groups . group i included genes that had higher expression in larval stages than any other life stages. the larva is a crucial assimilatory stage in the life history of insects  <cit> , especially holometabolous form such as p. xylostella, and serine protease genes have been identified from the larva of several insect species and presumed to function in protein digestion  <cit> . the genes in group ii displayed differential expressions, indicating that they may play diverse physiological roles in p. xylostella. for example,  <dig> genes tended to have higher expression in larval stages than in other stages, suggesting their potential roles in digestion. nine genes were highly expressed in eggs and pupae. px <dig> was expressed in pupae and adults, and px <dig> showed a high expression in the first instar larvae, pupae and adult males. px <dig> and px <dig> were homologous to mspap <dig> and mspap <dig>  respectively, playing roles in propo cleavage and activation  <cit> .fig.  <dig> expression profiling of the p. xylostella sp and sph genes across different developmental stages. the log <dig> rpkm values are presented by bar colors where the darker red represents higher expression values, the darker green represents lower expression values, and the gray represents missing values. e, eggs; l <dig>  1st-instar larvae; l <dig>  2nd-instar larvae; l <dig>  3rd-instar larvae; l <dig>  4th-instar larvae; p, pupae; am, adult males; af, adult females. the rpkm values are given in the additional file 10: table s3



group iii consisted of  <dig> genes, six of which were expressed with moderate levels in a given larval stage, but with undetectable or very low levels in eggs, pupae and adults. seventeen of the  <dig> genes showed exclusive and high expressions in adults, and exhibited a sex-specific pattern with  <dig> genes highly expressed in males and one gene highly expressed in females. four genes had high levels of expression in eggs, pupae and adult females, and nine genes were highly expressed in pupae and adult males. px <dig>  was expressed highly in eggs and adult females. in the drosophila embryo, this gene functions as a key component of dorso-ventral axis establishment  <cit> . the qpcr analysis confirmed stage-specific expression patterns of the ten genes that displayed high expressions based on rna-seq data . the differential expression patterns of serine proteases and homologs in different stages suggested their functional diversity in p. xylostella, but their functions remain to be identified.

tissue-specific expression profiling
rna-seq analysis showed that  <dig> of the  <dig> pxsp and pxsph genes exhibited expressions in at least one tissue . the midgut of 4th-instar larvae had the highest number  of genes expressed among the four tissues, while the number of genes expressed in the heads of 4th-instar larvae, adult males and females was  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. further analysis revealed that most of the pxsp and pxsph genes showed high levels of expression in the midgut of the 4th-instar larvae, but tended to express at very low levels in the head. previous research has demonstrated that the midgut is the most important tissue as an organ of food digestion and nutrient absorption  <cit> . other work has suggested that the rich larval midgut-specific serine proteinases reduce the adverse effects of plant protease inhibitors through differential expressions in response to feeding on different plant hosts  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we identified and characterized  <dig> putative sp/sph members in p. xylostella, along with their expression profiles in different developmental stages and tissues. our results reveal that the sp/sph complex may play various functions in p. xylostella, especially in digestion as suggested by highly expressed genes in the midgut and larval stages, and possibly in the immune system based on phylogenetic analysis of the clip genes. however, their functions remain to be validated by further molecular studies, such as gene cloning and protein identification, rnai, and/or crispr-cas <dig> to define target genes that may help explain this pest’s biological success, especially its capacity to adapt rapidly to the toxins in insecticides and occurring naturally in host plants. such work offers scope to generate additional genetic and metabolic targets for pest management in the future.
