BACKGROUND
urinary tract infections  are a major source of community and nosocomial infections and a major financial burden to healthcare systems  <cit> . between  <dig> and 20% of united states women report at least one uti and over  <dig> million hospitalized patients develop catheter-associated uti annually  <cit> . accordingly, the united states spends an estimated  <dig>  billion dollars annually on utis in adult women alone  <cit> . likewise, febrile uti are also a serious cause of bacterial infection in children and are associated with significant expenditures for hospital admissions due to febrile utis  <cit> .

the bladder is the most common site of uti  due to its proximity to the urethra and external intestinal flora. most episodes of cystitis respond to antibiotic treatment, however, a subset of patients develop ascending acute pyelonephritis , life-threatening bacterial urosepsis, or chronic, recurrent infections, often associated with antibiotic resistance. apn can lead to acute parenchymal damage and subsequent renal scarring in 15–60% of children and up to one third of adults  <cit> . ultimately, a subset of children with renal scarring will progress to hypertension, renal insufficiency, and less commonly end-stage renal disease  <cit> .

uropathogenic e. coli  are the most common cause of uti and are isolated in over 70% of cystitis or uti-related bacteremia cultures  <cit> . epidemiological studies of clinical isolates have identified virulence factors that aid in colonization, host evasion, and survival of upec strains  <cit> . upec exploit several virulence factors for adhesion, including p fimbriae and type  <dig> fimbriae, which allow the attachment and ascent of bacteria within the genitourinary tract  <cit> . type  <dig> fimbriae bind mannosylated uroplakin receptors on urothelium, and this binding is essential to the ability of upec to colonize the bladder . p fimbriae, or pyelonephritis-associated pili, are preferentially expressed in pyelonephritis isolates of upec and bind to glycosphingolipids present on renal epithelial cells  <cit> .

other upec virulence factors include the secreted toxins α-hemolysin  and cytotoxic necrotizing factor  <dig> . cnf <dig> and hlya are commonly found in upec isolates and are co-expressed as closely linked genes  <cit> . hlya alters the cytoskeleton of urothelial cells resulting in shedding of bladder urothelium and disruption of urothelial barrier function  <cit> . cnf <dig> is a 115-kda secreted toxin with a well-characterized role in the pathogenesis of neonatal meningitis from e. coli k <dig> infection  <cit> . cnf <dig> is expressed in 31–44% of cystitis and 36–48% of pyelonephritis human clinical upec isolates . despite the common expression of cnf <dig> in upec isolates, a role of cnf <dig> in the pathogenesis of clinical uti remains unclear. cnf <dig> has been shown to activate rho gtpases, contribute to urothelial cell invasion, and have cytotoxic effects on urothelium  <cit> . studies utilizing cnf1-deficient mutants have provided mixed results. a clinical upec isolate has been shown to outcompete a cnf1-deleted upec strain in vivo in a mouse model of cystitis  <cit> . however, a similar cnf1-deletion mutant failed to reduce the cytotoxicity to urothelium in vitro  <cit> . given the existing data supporting a role for cnf <dig> in the pathogenesis of upec cystitis, we sought to examine the potential role of cnf <dig> in e. coli pyelonephritis in vivo. to this end, we compared the ability of cnf1-deletion and wild-type upec to induce pyelonephritis in a mouse model of ascending infection.

methods
bacterial strains
the e. coli strain u <dig> was isolated previously from a female cystitis patient and has been characterized previously as an o18:k1:h <dig> serotype containing cnf <dig>  hlya, type ii capsule , ompt , p- , s- , and type  <dig>  fimbriae  <cit> . e. coli strain rs <dig>  was isolated previously from the cerebrospinal fluid of a neonate with meningitis  <cit> . the rs <dig> deletion mutants of cnf <dig> and fimh have been described previously  <cit> . e. coli stocks were stored at −70° in luria-bertani  broth supplemented with 20% glycerol. the identity of bacterial strains were routinely checked by pcr and plating on lb agar with strain-appropriate antibiotic selection. unless otherwise indicated, e. coli strains were routinely grown overnight at 37 °c in lb supplemented with the strain-appropriate antibiotics ampicillin , streptomycin , or chloramphenicol .

construction of isogenic cnf <dig> deletion mutants
the cnf <dig> deletion mutant of u <dig>  was constructed using the one-step pcr method by replacing the cnf <dig> gene with a chloramphenicol resistance cassette using phage λ red recombinase as described previously  <cit> . briefly, the u <dig> strain was transformed with pkd <dig> encoding arabinose-inducible λ red recombinase. a chloramphenicol resistance cassette was amplified from pkd <dig> using primers with homologous extensions, 3′ homology to the chloramphenicol cassette and 5′ homology to the 5′ and 3′ regions of the cnf <dig> gene: cnf1-kof 5′-gaaaggtgtcgcgtaatttatcaccagacctttgttgatacatactcaaagtgtaggctggagctgcttc, cnf1-kor 5′ggctcatatcttctcctgtcatgtgtgactgcactgttttgtggcaaacccatatgaatatcctccttag. the resulting pcr product was gel purified and transferred to competent and arabinose treated pkd46-containing u <dig> clones which expressed red recombinase via electroporation. transformants were grown on lb agar containing chloramphenicol  and 10 mm arabinose. the resultant deletion mutants of cnf <dig> were confirmed with pcr using the primers cnf1-ckf 5′ aaatcgaaacggctcatccg and cnf1-ckr 5′- cctctggaagagtctgtaac. lack of cnf <dig> protein expression was confirmed by western blot using a monoclonal anti-cnf <dig> antibody as described previously  <cit> . for use in mixed-infection experiments, a spontaneous streptomycin-resistant mutant of the u <dig> parent strain was isolated using standard direct-selection techniques. deletion mutants and parent strains demonstrated the same growth rates and characteristics in solid and liquid cultures.

murine model of pyelonephritis
all mice were housed in pathogen-free conditions, provided food and water ad libitum and all animal protocols were approved by an institutional animal care and use committee. the mouse strains c57bl/ <dig>  c3h/heouj, and cba/j were purchased from jackson labs, bar harbor, me. murine pyelonephritis and cystitis was established by transurethral inoculation of bacteria using a modification of previously described protocols  <cit> .  <dig> to 8 week old mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, catheterized with  <dig>  diameter polyethylene tubing , and transurethrally injected with 2 ×  <dig> cfu/ml of bacteria in 50 μl. mice were allowed to recover for 3 h, and then underwent an identical second inoculation. as described previously, two transurethral instillations of e. coli, separated by three hours, produced a higher rate of pyelonephritis , and more reproducible infections in c57bl/ <dig> mice, when compared to a single instillation  <cit> . at designated times, mice were euthanized and the bladder and kidneys from each mouse were harvested and either homogenized in phosphate buffered saline  for bacterial enumeration or processed for flow cytometry. for bacterial enumeration, organs were homogenized and plated using serial dilution on lb agar to calculate the number of bacterial colony forming units  in each organ. for mixed-infections bacterial strains were plated on strain-appropriate antibiotics to obtain cfu for individual strains. the identity of bacterial strains isolated from animals was routinely checked by pcr and plating on lb agar with strain-appropriate antibiotic selection. data from in-vivo experiments is displayed in figures and available in a additional file  <dig> online.

flow cytometry
flow cytometric analysis of kidney and bladder infiltrates was performed on single cell suspensions isolated following digestion. following infection, kidneys and bladders were homogenized in rpmi media  containing 1 mg/ml collagenase d and 100 μg/ml dnase i , supplemented with 20 mm hepes and 10% fetal calf serum . suspensions were and digested for 45 min at 37 °c, passed through 40 μm cell strainers, treated with bd pharm lyse™ , and cell pellets rinsed in pbs with 2% fcs. for cell staining 1 ×  <dig> cells were placed on ice in 12 × 75 mm tubes, blocked with fc block™ and stained with a cocktail of conjugated antibodies for 15 min, rinsed in pbs with 2% fcs, and stained with 3 μm dapi . absolute cell numbers were determined using 123count ebeads  following the manufacturer’s instructions. samples were analyzed with a bd lsr ii flow cytometer and facsdiva software . antibodies used included: bv <dig> rat anti-mouse cd <dig>  percp-cy <dig>  rat anti-mouse ly-6c, fitc rat anti-mouse ly-6g , and apc anti-mouse cd11c, pe/cy <dig> anti-mouse cd11b, and pe anti-mouse f4/ <dig> .

statistical analysis
all experiments were performed in triplicate to ensure reproducibility and representative data are shown. data from groups of mice were compared using students t-test, with p ≤  <dig> , considered significant.

RESULTS
effect of cnf <dig> deletion on e. coli infection in the murine urinary tract
the e. coli virulence factor cnf <dig> has been previously implicated in the pathogenesis of upec bladder infection but its potential role in kidney infection remains unknown  <cit> . in order to examine the contribution of cnf <dig>  we generated an isogenic cnf <dig> deletion mutant  of the clinical isolate upec strain u <dig> . as shown in fig. 1a, a one-step pcr method was utilized to delete the cnf <dig> gene in the u <dig> strain  <cit> . the resultant cnf1-deletion mutant lacked cnf <dig> expression when compared to the parent u <dig> strain . also shown in fig. 1b is the e. coli strain rs <dig>  and the rs <dig> deletion mutant of cnf <dig> described previously  <cit> .fig.  <dig> construction of u <dig> cnf <dig> deletion mutant. a one-stp pcr deletion of cnf <dig> in u <dig> bacteria . a chloramphenicol resistance cassette  was pcr-amplified from pkd <dig> with homologous extensions  of the cnf <dig> locus and transferred to pkd <dig> red recombinase-expressing u <dig> clones and selected for chloramphenicol resistance. b western blot of u <dig>  u <dig> cnf <dig> deletion mutant , rs <dig>  and rs <dig> cnf <dig> deletion mutants  with monoclonal cnf <dig> antibody




to examine the role of cnf <dig> in the pathogenesis of pyelonephritis, we used a murine model of ascending pyelonephritis following transurethral instillation of e. coli  <cit> . as shown in fig.  <dig>  c57bl/ <dig> mice developed reproducible kidney and bladder infections following transurethral instillation. when compared to the parent u <dig> strain, loss of cnf <dig> did not alter bacterial counts in the kidney or bladder. in addition, the kinetics of infection with the cnf <dig> deletion mutant were the same as those with the parent u <dig> strain, both early during infection at 6 h , 24 h , and late during infection at 10 days . to more directly compare the ability of u <dig> and cnf <dig> deletion mutant strains to cause uti in the same animal, we used a mixed-infection model. this model attempts to eliminate inter-animal variability by infecting the same animal with both strains, allowing competition between strains in a single animal. after introduction of u <dig> and cnf <dig> deletion strains in equal amounts in the same animal, we found no difference in bacterial counts of either strain in either the bladder or kidney at 24 h .fig.  <dig> bacterial counts  in kidney and bladder during pyelonephritis. a 6 h, b 24 h, or c 10 days following infection with the parent strain u <dig>  or cnf <dig> deletion mutant . d mixed-infection model showing bacterial counts of u <dig> or Δcnf <dig> strains 24 h following infection with both strains in single animals




there is known variability in the susceptibility among mouse strains to uti  <cit> . therefore, we performed similar experiments testing the effect of cnf <dig> deletion on bacterial virulence in two additional mouse strains: c3h/heouj and cba/j. the cba/j and c3h/heouj strains have been used by others in uti models  <cit> . we found robust infections in the bladder and kidney of both c3h/heouj and cba/j mice . compared to c57bl/ <dig> mice, cba/j mice demonstrated a  <dig> -log reduction in bacterial counts in the kidney at 24 h . however, we found no difference in bacterial counts between the parent u <dig> strain and the cnf <dig> deletion mutant in infected cba/j mice .fig.  <dig> bacterial counts  in kidney and bladder during pyelonephritis, 24 h after infection. a cba/j mice infected with the parent strain u <dig>  or cnf <dig> deletion mutant . b c3h/heouj mice infected with the parent rs <dig> or deletion mutants of cnf <dig>  or fimh .  




cnf <dig> has been shown previously to contribute to uti in the c3h/heouj strain, therefore, we next performed experiments in c3h/heouj mice. using the e. coli parent strain rs <dig> and an isogenic deletion mutants of cnf <dig> , deletion of cnf <dig> did not alter the ability of upec to infect the bladder or kidney of c3h/heouj mice   <cit> . given the apparent lack of contribution of cnf <dig> to infection in our model of acending pyelonephritis, we next examined the contribution of type i fimbriae in our model using a tip adhesin fimh  mutant in the rs <dig> strain . fimh as is a well-documented upec virulence factor involved in bacterial adherence to urothelium  <cit> . in contrast to data from cnf <dig> deletion mutants, loss of fimh resulted in a  <dig>  log-reduction and  <dig>  log-reduction in bacterial counts within the bladder and kidney, respectively .

role of cnf <dig> in leukocyte recruitment during pyelonephritis
cnf <dig> has been shown to upregulate genes related to innate immunity in the mouse bladder during cystitis and to modulate neutrophil function in vitro  <cit> . based on these findings, we explored the potential role of cnf <dig> to modulate leukocyte recruitment during pyelonephritis. we used flow cytometry to characterize the leukocyte composition of the kidney and bladder in mice with pyelonephritis. infection with the parent upec strain u <dig> in our model of ascending pyelonephritis induced rapid recruitment of neutrophils and ly6chiinflammatory monocytes to the kidney  and bladder  within 6 h after infection. deletion of cnf <dig> did not alter the robust neutrophil and monocyte infiltrate in mice infected with the cnf <dig> deletion mutant upec in either the kidney  or bladder .fig.  <dig> flow cytometry analysis of kidney infiltrates during pyelonephritis infection with the parent u <dig> strain, or cnf <dig> deletion mutant .  the number of  neutrophils ,  monocytes , and  renal dendritic cells  are shown

we also examined kidney and bladder dendritic cells  during pyelonephritis. renal dc are resident cells important for innate immunity and bacterial clearance during pyelonephritis  <cit> . in addition, cnf <dig> has recently been shown to alter e. coli uptake by macrophages  <cit> . in response to renal injury, renal dc migrate to draining lns where they present antigens  <cit> . as such, we observed a rapid decrease in renal dc during pyelonephritis . we also found equivalent numbers of renal dc in mice infected with either u <dig> e. coli or the cnf <dig> deletion mutant  . unlike renal dc, the majority of bladder dc during uti are recruited to the bladder and are less important for bacterial clearance  <cit> . we observed no statistically significant difference in the numbers of dc recruited to bladders of mice infected with u <dig> e. coli or the cnf <dig> deletion mutant  .

discussion
in this study, we examined the role of cnf <dig> in the pathogenesis of e. coli uti in vivo using a mouse model of pyelonephritis by transurethral inoculation. using the upec strain u <dig> and an isogenic cnf <dig> deletion mutant, we demonstrated that e. coli lacking cnf <dig> were equally efficient at infecting the bladder and kidney after transurethral inoculation. we found no evidence that deletion of cnf <dig> altered the severity of upec during uti. our results are in agreement with prior studies by johnson et al., who found that deletion of cnf <dig> did not alter upec virulence during uti  <cit> . in contrast, rippere-lampe and colleagues have previously described attenuation of upec virulence after cnf <dig> deletion  <cit> . in addition, recent data suggests that antibodies directed against cnf <dig> can reduce bacterial burden during experimental models of cystitis  <cit> .

there are several notable differences between our study and those of other groups. first, differences in animal models of uti will directly affect the bacterial-host interaction. we specifically designed our model to cause robust pyelonephritis in the majority of animals. to accomplish this our group, and others, used two transurethral inoculations of upec, compared to a single inoculation with standard uti models . we use primarily c57bl/ <dig> mice, but also performed experiments in the c3h/heouj strain used by rippere-lampe and colleagues. second, we used different clinical upec isolates, which may vary in their ability to infect the urinary tract. in an attempt to mitigate strain-specific findings we obtained similar results with cnf <dig> deletion mutants from two e. coli strains, rs <dig> and u <dig>  it is possible that there is variation between upec strains containing cnf <dig>  and that cnf <dig> plays a role in infection in other strains. it is also possible that certain host mouse strains are more susceptible to the effects of cnf <dig> expression in upec. in our model, however, we found no evidence to support the hypothesis that cnf <dig> plays a significant role in the infection of the urinary tract in vivo.


the cytotoxic effects of cnf- <dig> have been well documented. cnf- <dig> induces stress fiber formation in endothelial cells to promote bacterial invasion and has been shown to be directly cytotoxic to urothelium  <cit> . in addition, cnf <dig> has been shown to upregulate genes related to innate immunity in the mouse bladder during cystitis, and to modulate neutrophil function in vitro  <cit> . despite these findings, we did not find a role for cnf- <dig> in altering immune cell infiltration or dc migration during pyelonephritis. however, this does not exclude a role for cnf- <dig> in regulating inflammation during cystitis or specific dc subsets during immune responses.

a role for cnf- <dig> in the pathogenesis of uti is often inferred from the prevalence of cnf- <dig> expression in clinical isolates of upec. yet, there is strong evidence that the virulence of cnf <dig> expressing strains is derived from the co-expression of hlya. prior cnf- <dig> studies have highlighted the close genetic linkage between hly and cnf <dig>  <cit> . cnf <dig> is expressed in 31–44% of cystitis and 36–48% of pyelonephritis clinical isolates , whereas approximately one-half of e. coli isolated from cystitis  or pyelonephritis  isloates produce hemolysin  <cit> . of hemolytic isolates from extraintestinal infections , a large fraction  encode the cnf <dig>  but cnf <dig> is rarely found in nonhemolytic upec isolates  <cit> . furthermore, animal studies, including ours, have failed to provide hly-independent effects of cnf <dig> using deletion mutants.

CONCLUSIONS
while further examination of cnf- <dig> may reveal a role in uti pathogenesis, our data casts doubt on the role of cnf- <dig> in the pathogenesis of upec uti. future research on e. coli virulence factors is clearly needed, as urologic infections are an important and evolving clinical problem. in the era of rising antibiotic resistance, understanding bacterial virulence mechanisms may reveal further therapeutic targets and lead to novel treatments.
