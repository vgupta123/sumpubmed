BACKGROUND
wheat flour can be made into a wide variety of foods due to the unique viscoelastic properties of dough  <cit> . these viscoelastic properties result from gluten proteins, which account for about 80% of the total grain proteins  <cit> . wheat gluten is composed of two main components: glutenin and gliadin. glutenin plays a major role in dough’s elasticity, while gliadin contributes mainly to dough’s viscosity  <cit> . according to their relative mobility in sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , glutenin proteins are generally divided into high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits  and low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits   <cit> . lmw-gss have molecular weights ranging from 20 kda to 45 kda, making up 60% of glutenin proteins and one third of seed storage proteins  <cit> . based on the first amino acid of the mature proteins, lmw-gss have been classified into three types: i- , m-  and s-   <cit> .

lmw-gss are encoded by a multi-gene family whose members are located at glu-a <dig>  glu-b <dig> and glu-d <dig> loci on the short arms of homologous chromosomes 1a, 1b, and 1d, respectively  <cit> . without a complete genome sequence, it is hard to determine the exact members of lmw-gs gene family in a wheat variety. in the past decade, the lmw-gs gene family members were characterized in only a few wheat varieties, including norin  <dig>  glenlea and xiaoyan  <dig>  <cit> . twelve to  <dig> lmw-gs genes were identified from individual varieties using complementary methods, including cdna or dna bac library screening and proteomic analysis. recently, a new molecular marker system was developed to identify lmw-gs gene family members which used high-resolution capillary electrophoresis to separate fragments of gene members with three conserved primer sets   <cit> . using this marker system, more than  <dig> lmw-gs genes were detected from single wheat variety  <cit> . this marker system was also used as a complementary tool for the allelic determination of lmw-gs genes at glu-b <dig> locus in wheat cultivars and segregating populations  <cit> . a full-length gene-cloning method based on this marker system has been used to clone  <dig> or  <dig> lmw-gs genes in individual bread wheat genotypes  <cit> . both the marker system and the gene cloning method were applied to investigate the composition of lmw-gs genes in large populations, including aroona near-isogenic lines and the micro-core collections  of chinese wheat germplasm  <cit> , demonstrating their efficiency in dissecting this complex gene family in common wheat.

wild progenitors and relatives could provide tremendous genetic variability to broaden the gene-pool of common wheat  <cit> . in the past decades, several important agronomic genes have been well characterized, such as the stem rust resistance gene sr <dig>  the leaf rust resistance genes  from aegilops tauschii, the high grain protein content  gene from tetraploid wheat and the chromosome arm 1rs containing both disease resistance and high yield genes from rye  <cit> . t. urartu is the wild diploid wheat from the fertile crescent region, and has long been considered as the a-genome donor in polyploid wheat species  <cit> . isozyme, rapd and aflp markers have detected large genetic variations in t. urartu populations  <cit> . recently, a set of genes were also characterized in t. urartu, e.g., the powdery mildew resistance gene , and the grain length controlling gene   <cit> . abundant variability of storage proteins in t. urartu, was detected in gliadin proteins and hmw-gss using electrophoretic procedures or nucleotide sequence analysis  <cit> . several variants with repetitive domain length polymorphism were also observed in lmw-gs genes  <cit> . however, the detailed composition and genetic diversity of lmw-gs genes in t. urartu remain unknown.

dissecting the composition and diversity of lmw-gs genes in t. urartu is prerequisite to broadening the genetic resources for bread-making quality improvement in common wheat; unraveling the genetic diversity of t. urartu will facilitate its gene and germplasm conservation. in this study, a systematic molecular analysis of lmw-gs genes in t. urartu was conducted using complementary approaches, including high-throughput molecular marker system, gene cloning, two-dimensional electrophoresis , liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry , matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight tandem mass spectrometry  and sds-page. the gene composition, variation, organization and expression pattern were extensively investigated in  <dig> accessions collected from the fertile crescent region, which is widely considered as the center of origin and diversity of t. urartu  <cit> . genetic diversity of lmw-gs genes and genotypes in t. urartu and their evolutionary clues pertaining to wheat species of different ploidy were further discussed.

RESULTS
composition and variation of lmw-gs genes in t. urartu
for each conserved primer set of the lmw-gs marker system  <cit> , more than  <dig> dna fragments were amplified from the t. urartu population. totally,  <dig> non-redundant dna fragments from the population, with six or seven from each accession, were determined and named according to the experimental or theoretical size of their corresponding fragments amplified by the lmwgs <dig> primer set   <cit> . typically, the sequenced accession, pi <dig>   <cit> , had seven lmw-gs genes, including tua3- <dig>  tua3- <dig>  tua3- <dig>  tua3- <dig>  tua3- <dig>  tua3- <dig> and tua3- <dig> . among  <dig> accessions,  <dig> different genotypes  were identified; each genotype had unique fragment sizes except for u <dig> and u <dig>  which were discriminated by snps within three lmw-gs genes  according to the subsequent gene cloning data . regarding the frequencies of the genotypes in the t. urartu population, u <dig> was the most abundant , followed by u <dig> , u <dig>  and u <dig> ; the remaining  <dig> genotypes totally accounted for 24% of accessions, in which the genotypes u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig> and u <dig> were discovered in only one or two accessions .table  <dig>

to further characterize the lmw-gs genes represented by these dna fragments,  <dig> typical accessions, covering all  <dig> genotypes, were subjected to gene cloning using the full-length gene cloning method   <cit> . generally, six or seven lmw-gs gene sequences were cloned in each accession, which matched well with six or seven dna fragments detected with the marker system. totally,  <dig> lmw-gs sequences were obtained and deposited in genbank ; these sequences were derived from eight lmw-gs genes  determined in the t. urartu population due to the redundancy and large number of allelic variants . among these genes, only two or three variants were detected for each of the tua3- <dig>  tua3- <dig>  tua3- <dig>  tu-a3- <dig> and tua3- <dig> genes. in contrast, at least seven variants were identified for each of the tua3- <dig>  tua3- <dig> and tua3- <dig> . all allelic variants resulted in  <dig> genotypes at the glu-a <dig> locus in t. urartu, which was consistent with the genotypes based on the size of dna fragment in the marker system .

lmw-gs genes in t. urartu
among the eight genes, four  were m-type, three  were i-type and one  was s-type.

m-type lmw-gs genes
tua3- <dig> gene with two variants, tua3-385a and tua3-385b, was widely distributed in the t. urartu population. both variants were supposed as pseudo-genes due to immature stop codons at their repetitive domains . another common gene, tua3- <dig> contained three allelic variants: tua3- <dig>  tua3- <dig> and tua3- <dig> . all three allelic variants of tua3- <dig> gene were pseudo-genes because of immature stop codons at either their repetitive or c-terminal i domains. tua3- <dig> was also a common gene in t. urartu population. tua3-397a was the major allelic variant , but it might be a pseudo-gene. the other variant, tua3-397b might encode an m-type lmw-gs for its intact open reading frame  . tua3- <dig> gene was seldom detected in t. urartu population; its two allelic variants  were only detected in four and five accessions, respectively . these two allelic variants shared 99% identity despite two 3-bp indels and several snps . the tua3- <dig> allelic variant was a pseudo-gene due to the immature stop codon at its c-terminal ii domain, whereas tua3- <dig> was supposed to be active for its intact orf.

i-type lmw-gs genes
three i-type genes: tua3- <dig>  tua3- <dig> and tua3- <dig> were identified in each t. urartu accession. the tua3- <dig> gene had nine variants: tua3- <dig>  tua3- <dig>  tua3-502a/b/c/d, tua3- <dig>  tua3- <dig> and tua3- <dig> . tua3-502a was the major allelic variant of the tua3- <dig> gene with an occupation of  <dig> % accessions, and tua3-502b was another widely distributed variant and detected in  <dig> % accessions . among nine variants, only tua3- <dig>  tua3-502a and tua3-502c might be active genes with intact orfs.

another i-type gene tua3- <dig> had seven variants: tua3- <dig>  tua3-538a/b/c/d/e and tua3- <dig> in the t. urartu population. all the variants were supposed to be active genes for their intact orfs, except for the tua3-538d variant. the tua3-538a/b/c/d/e variants distinguished themselves mainly by different repeat number of cag and caa motifs at the c-terminal ii domain in addition to several snps throughout their coding regions. the tua3- <dig> variant shared >99% identity with each of the tua3-538a/b/c/d/e variants. compared with the other allelic variants of the tua3- <dig> gene, the long fragment of tua3- <dig> was mainly derived from two insertions  at the repetitive domain . among these allelic variants, the tua3-538a, tua3-538b and tua3-538c were widely distributed in the t. urartu population, occupying  <dig> % of variants. tua3- <dig>  tua3-538d, tua3-538e and tua3- <dig> were rare, present in a few accessions .

the tua3- <dig> gene contained  <dig> variants: tua3- <dig>  tua3- <dig>  tua3-576a/b/c/d/e, tua3-579a/b, tua3- <dig> and tua3- <dig>  many of them might be active genes based on their intact orfs, whereas tua3- <dig> and tua3-576d were pseudo-genes with immature stop codons at their repetitive and c-terminal ii domains. the tua3-576a/b/c/d/e variants were distinguished by indels at c-terminal ii domain and snps throughout their coding sequences . long deletions and insertions caused different fragment lengths of the variants of tua3- <dig> gene. two deletions, 142-bp at the repetitive domain and 30-bp at the c-terminal i domain, were detected in the tua3- <dig> variant. a 24-bp deletion was also found at the repetitive domain of tua3- <dig> variant. in the tua3- <dig> variant, a 24-bp insertion was identified at its repetitive domain. three insertions were detected in the tua3- <dig> variant: 33-bp and 69-bp at the repetitive domain, and 21-bp at the c-terminal iii domain . among these variants, the tua3-576a, tua3- <dig>  tua3-579a, tua3-579b and tua3-576b were widely distributed in the t. urartu population, with proportions of  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively .

s-type lmw-gs gene
tua3- <dig> has the n-terminal region  of typical s-type lmw-gs and a short s-type protein specific peptide  at the repetitive domain . the first amino acid of the mature protein of tua3- <dig> was ser after the peptide men were cut from the original protein. thus, tua3- <dig> belonged to s-type lmw-gs. the tua3- <dig> gene was the only s-type lmw-gs gene detected in the t. urartu population. its three variants: tua3- <dig>  tua3- <dig> and tua3- <dig>  shared >99% identity. and all were pseudo-genes with immature stop codons both at their repetitive and c-terminal i domains. compared with tua3- <dig>  the 3-bp  and 12-bp  insertions at their repetitive domains were responsible for the larger fragment lengths of tua3- <dig> and tua3- <dig>  respectively . the tua3- <dig> gene was detected in only  <dig> % accessions, tua3- <dig> , tua3- <dig> , and tua3- <dig>  .

expression of lmw-gs genes in t. urartu
the bread-making quality of wheat flour is attributed greatly to the composition of lmw-gss and the number of expressed genes  <cit> . to investigate the expression pattern of lmw-gs genes in t. urartu, four accessions from four genotypes, u <dig> , u <dig> , u <dig>  and u <dig> , in turn containing one, two, three and four genes with intact orfs, were selected and subjected to proteomic analysis. all the spots on 2-de gels of pi <dig>  pi <dig> and pi <dig>  and the spots of lmw-gss of pi <dig> were identified by lc-ms/ms or maldi-tof/tof ms .figure  <dig>

of the  <dig> spots investigated for pi <dig> in the u <dig> genotype, three  were lmw-gss, two were globulin,  <dig> were gliadins, and the remaining spots were other storage proteins  . spots  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were in turn matched to protein tua3-538b, tua3-579a and tua3-502a in u <dig>  and corresponded to the middle, upper and lower bands in sds-page due to their same mobility, respectively . in the pi <dig> accession with the u <dig> genotype, five spots were identified as lmw-gss. spots  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in turn matched deduced amino acid sequences of tua3-538b, tua3-579b and tua3-502a, whereas both spots  <dig> and  <dig> matched tua3-397b. all of these spots had corresponding bands with the same mobility in sds-page . interestingly, tua3- <dig>  which was only identified in the u <dig> genotype, shared the same 2-de protein spot and sds-page band with tua3-397b due to their similar molecular mass and isoelectric point  value in our previous ms/ms identification  . in pi <dig>  spots  <dig> and  <dig> were proteins of the only active variant, tua3-538c in u2; six  and eight  high-quality peptide sequences obtained by ms/ms analysis matched hypothetical polypeptides of tua3-538c, respectively . moreover, these two spots also corresponded to the only band  detected with sds-page . with regard to pi <dig> of the u <dig> genotype, spot  <dig> was a protein product of the tua3-538e variant in u <dig> and corresponded to the lower band  in sds-page, and spot  <dig> was that of the tua3-576b variant and matched the upper band  in sds-page . the sds-page data for all the genotypes confirmed that four main types of bands corresponded to intact orfs of tua3-397/tua3- <dig>  tua3- <dig>  tua3- <dig> and tua3- <dig> in this t. urartu population by comparing their electrophoretic mobility with deduced protein molecular weights . collectively, the expression patterns of lmw-gs genes in t. urartu were consistent with the active genes determined using the lmw-gs marker system and full-length gene cloning method.

generally, i-type genes were the main active genes in t. urartu, and one to three of them were expressed in individual accessions . one i-type variant, tua3-538c, was expressed in  <dig> accessions of the u <dig> genotype. and all three i-type genes, tua3- <dig>  tua3- <dig> and tua3- <dig> were characterized as expressed genes in the u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig> and u <dig> genotypes, which together contained  <dig> % of the total accessions . all the m-type genes were pseudo-genes except for the tua3-397b and tua3- <dig> allelic variants, which were only detected in the u <dig>  and u <dig>  genotypes . none of the variants of the s-type gene, tua3- <dig>  were active as no protein bands were detected on 2-de and sds-page, which was consistent with the stop codons in their cds regions .

characteristics of lmw-gs genes in t. urartu
based on the first amino acid of their mature protein sequences, the eight genes in t. urartu were classified into three types . tua3- <dig>  tua3- <dig>  tua3- <dig> and tua3- <dig> were m-type, tua3- <dig> was s-type and tua3- <dig>  tua3- <dig> and tua3- <dig> were i-type genes. their deduced mature proteins contained three conserved domains , except for the i-type subunit which lacked the n-terminal domain . cysteine residues could form inter- and intra-chain disulphide bonds which are of great importance for the formation of glutenin polymers  <cit> . all the subunits identified in the t. urartu population contained eight cysteine residues. the location of these cysteine residues, in the m- and i-type genes, were conserved with six of the residues at the c-terminal i domain and one at each of the c-terminal ii and iii domains, except for the first and the third cysteine residues in the m-type genes, tua3-397b and tua3- <dig> . the m-type lmw-gss were also different from the i-type genes in molecular weight. the estimated molecular weight of tua3-397b and tua3- <dig> were  <dig>  kda and  <dig>  kda, respectively, substantially lower than the average molecular weight of all the i-type genes  because of longer repetitive regions in the i-type subunits .

among the three i-type genes, tua3- <dig> was more tightly linked with tua3- <dig> gene than tua3- <dig> gene, since a set of variants of tua3- <dig> and tua3- <dig> genes co-segregated  . interestingly, the tua3-502b, tua3- <dig> and tua3-538c variants might form a haplotype , because they co-segregated exclusively in  <dig> accessions of the u <dig> genotype . tua3- <dig>  tua3- <dig> and tua3- <dig> might also form a haplotype due to their co-occurrence in the five accessions of the u <dig> genotype .

all variants of the eight lmw-gs genes in t. urartu were subjected to phylogenetic analysis using clustalw <dig> and mega  <dig>  two main clades were obtained in the phylogenetic tree, one containing all the m- and s-type genes, and the other including all the i-type genes . in the m- and s-type gene clade, four sub-clades were further divided, each containing variants of a single gene, except for the sub-clade of tua3- <dig>  where tua3- <dig> was also involved . in the clade of i-type genes, three sub-clades were further divided, which corresponded to the tua3- <dig>  tua3- <dig> and tua3- <dig> genes, accordingly .figure  <dig>

the  <dig> analyzed t. urartu accessions were collected in the fertile crescent region, including northeastern lebanon, southeastern turkey, armenia, syria, iraq and iran, where many temperate-zone agricultural crops originated and were domesticated  <cit> . for the purpose of better exploitation and in situ genetic conservation of t. urartu germplasm, the geographic distribution of their lmw-gs genes/variants and genotypes was analyzed.

southeastern turkey was the region of the greatest diversity where all eight genes and  <dig> of their total  <dig> variants were detected, as well as ten unique variants were found . in northeastern lebanon,  <dig> variants of seven genes  were detected; all were shared by southeastern turkey except tua3-397b and tua3-579b . with regard to the genotypes of lmw-gs genes, southeastern turkey was also the region of the highest/ diversity, as the majority of genotypes were detected there . moreover, seven genotypes  were unique to southeastern turkey . in northeastern lebanon and syria, seven and four genotypes were detected, respectively. all genotypes were also present in southeastern turkey except for the u <dig> genotype . despite containing the unique genotype, u <dig>  armenia shared the u <dig> genotype with southeastern turkey and northeastern lebanon . in iraq and iran, the only genotype, u <dig>  was also detected in southeastern turkey, northeastern lebanon and syria . in summary, southeastern turkey should be the center of origin for t. urartu because the greatest diversity of lmw-gs genes/variants and genotypes were detected. and in the five remaining collection areas, almost all the genes/variants and genotypes were observed in southeastern turkey.figure  <dig>

discussion
lmw-gs genes in t. urartu
eight lmw-gs genes, i.e., four m-type, three i-type and one s-type genes, were characterized in the t. urartu population. in each accession, six to seven genes were detected, the highest number of lmw-gs genes reported at glu-a <dig> locus to our best knowledge. to investigate the evolutionary relationships of lmw-gs genes between t. urartu and other diploid or polyploid wheats, all the gene sequences in t. urartu were queried with the nucleotide blast program in ncbi. gene sequences sharing high identity  with the lmw-gs genes in t. urartu were found .

as the homolog of tua3- <dig> gene, a3- <dig> was previously identified in common wheat  <cit> . this gene was extremely conserved between t. urartu and common wheat with 99% identity shared among its variants. . tua3- <dig> was universal in t. urartu. its variants, tua3-397a and tua3-397b, shared more than 96% identity with a3-394b and a3- <dig>  allelic variants of a3- <dig> gene in common wheat, respectively   <cit> . tua3- <dig> and a3- <dig> should be homologs. another gene, tua3- <dig> in t. urartu, also showed 99% identity with variants of a3- <dig> gene . tua3- <dig> was only detected in u <dig> and u <dig> whereas tua3- <dig> was a common gene in t. urartu. moreover, both genes were located in the same branch in the phylogenetic tree . it might be reasonable to hypothesize that the tua3- <dig> gene was derived from a duplication of the tua3- <dig> gene.figure  <dig>

and common wheat.  phylogenetic analysis of m- and s-type genes.  phylogenetic analysis of i-type genes. triangle represents sequences from common wheat. the gliadin protein sequence  was used as the out-group.



for tua3- <dig>  no homolog was found at glu-a <dig> locus of other wheat species, but interestingly this gene shared >98% identity with d3- <dig> at the glu-d <dig> locus  in hexaploid wheat  <cit>  and the gludt- <dig> allele  in ae. tauschii . and phylogenetic analysis showed the tua3- <dig> and d3- <dig> genes clustered together . thus, the tua3- <dig> and d3- <dig> genes were homologs between t. urartu and common wheat. however, tua3- <dig> was a pseudo-gene and d3- <dig> was an active gene in both common wheat and ae. tauschii. this m-type gene should be an ancient gene that emerged before the divergence of the a and d genomes, but this gene was lost at the glu-a <dig> locus during wheat polyploidization . during evolution, this gene in t. urartu was mutated and became a pseudo-gene, but the gene in ae. tauschii and common wheat maintained an intact orf.

tua3- <dig> was the first s-type lmw-gs gene detected at the glu-a <dig> locus in triticum. interestingly, all of its blast hits  in blast databases were not s-type but m-type genes . and the phylogenetic analysis indicated that the variants of tua3- <dig> were in the same clade with m-type genes at the glu-b <dig> and glu-d <dig> loci in triticum aestivum  and ae. speltoides  but not s-type genes . protein sequence alignments were performed to understand the variations among tua3- <dig>  the known s- and m-type lmw-gss . besides the conserved s-type n-terminal domain  and the s-type specific peptide  at the repetitive domain, tua3- <dig> had  <dig> unique amino acids throughout the protein sequences, including one unique cysteine residue at the c-terminal ii domain. moreover, compared with the known m- and s-type lmw-gss, tua3- <dig> contained three deletions  at the repetitive domain . thus, tua3- <dig> is a new s-type gene at the a genome, which is homologous with the s-type genes at the b and d genomes, rather than a chimeric gene containing s- and m-type gene sequences. the s-type lmw-gs genes were closer to the m-type genes than the i-type ones . our deduced protein sequence alignments also revealed that the s-type lmw-gss had higher similarities with the m-type lmw-gss , and the m-type lmw-gss shared the variations with all s-type proteins from a, b and d genomes. thus, m-type gene should be the oldest type of lmw-gs gene, and s-type genes probably originated from m-type lmw-gs genes due to the mutation of met to men in the n-terminal region, which was consistent with the previous observations  <cit> . even though containing several unique features, tua3- <dig> had a pretty high similarity with the m-type genes, especially possessed one insertion  at the c-terminal domain and four amino acids , which were exclusively contained in the m-type lmw-gss. all these data indicate that this new s-type tua3- <dig> gene also originated from the m-type lmw-gs genes. however, most features  of the previously characterized s-type lmw-gss could not be detected in tua3- <dig>  implying that tua3- <dig> might not share the same evolutionary process with other s-type lmw-gs genes from the primitive m-type lmw-gs gene, or they could originate from different m-type genes.

three i-type genes, tua3- <dig>  tua3- <dig> and tua3- <dig> detected in t. urartu were relatively conserved across triticum species. all variants of the tua3- <dig> gene share high identity  with the a3-502b allele  in common wheat, except for tua3- <dig> and tua3- <dig>  which were homologous to a3-502f   and a3- <dig>  , respectively  with a3-649- <dig> and a3- <dig> than the other i-type genes in common wheat. the tua3- <dig> gene in t. urartu might be the homolog of a3-649- <dig> and a3- <dig> in common wheat due to their high identity . the variants of these three i-type genes also showed high identities to i-type genes identified in wheat relatives, with tua3-502c to aj <dig>  in triticum durum, tua3-538b to fj <dig>  in triticum monococcum and tua3-576a to dq <dig>  in triticum dicoccoides .

however, the i-type genes preserved high polymorphisms at the glu-a <dig> locus of triticum  <cit> . in t. urartu, all accessions possessed three i-type genes, compared with 2- <dig> genes in common wheat, implying that the glu-a <dig> locus might be derived from more than one origin of t. urartu and suffered rapid genome divergence. moreover, all the three i-type genes in many t. urartu accessions were active genes, while only one or two genes were expressed in common wheat. this indicated that t. urartu is valuable in quality improvement in common wheat since a high number of active genes might contribute to superior bread-making quality  <cit> . moreover, the i-type genes  had positive effects on dough quality, e.g. percentage of sds-unextractable fraction in total polymeric protein, dough resistance and extensibility  <cit> . the corresponding homologs of a3- <dig> and a3- <dig> were also detected in t. urartu.

turkey was established as the center of origin and diversity with abundant plant species and endemism based on its variety in geomorphology, topography and climate  <cit> . furthermore, southeastern turkey exhibits great genetic diversity of plants in the triticeae family, and is supposed to be the origin of domestication for wheat and einkorn   <cit> . among the six collection areas in this work, southeastern turkey showed the highest genetic diversity of lmw-gs genes  and genotypes  in t. urartu . almost all of the genes/variants and genotypes detected in the remaining areas were also detected in southeastern turkey. moreover, many variants  and genotypes  were unique to southeastern turkey . even though the u <dig> genotype was exclusively detected in northeastern lebanon and syria and the u <dig> genotype was specifically identified in armenia, similar genotypes were widely present in southeastern turkey  . considering the largest genetic diversity and typical lmw-gs genes/variants and genotypes, southeastern turkey might be the center of origin and diversity of t. urartu. this conclusion was confirmed by the analysis of the loci coding storage proteins  <cit>  and the assessment of aflp markers  <cit> .

lebanon was supposed as a center of specific adaptation for diploid and tetraploid wheats given that some morphological characters were exclusively detected there  <cit> . however, fewer unique lmw-gs genes/variants and genotypes were detected in t. urartu accessions from northeastern lebanon than those from southeastern turkey . northwestern syria was regarded as one of the regions of richest genetic diversity of t. urartu based on the assessment by aflp markers  <cit> . iran is one of the primary centers of diversity for wheat and its relatives; wild wheats, in particular diploid species, are extensively distributed in its various parts  <cit> . however, low genetic diversity of t. urartu in syria and iran was detected due to the lack of accessions collected, and the lmw-gs genes/variants and genotypes identified in these two areas were shared by southeastern turkey and/or northeastern lebanon . larger collections of t. urartu are needed for further analyses to draw more precise conclusions about the diversity of lmw-gs genes/variants and genotypes in syria and iran.

direct a genome donors of t. aestivum
common wheat  is believed to be the result of spontaneous crosses between t. dicoccoides  and ae. tauschii ; t. dicoccoides  was produced by the hybridization between t. urartu  and the b genome ancestor which was speculated as ae. speltoides   <cit> . considering its wide adaptability and variation, common wheat is believed to have arisen more than once from crosses of different genotypes of its progenitor species  <cit> . the determination of the specific donors of the a genome of bread wheat would benefit not only the genetic diversity conservation of t. urartu but expand the genetic basis for bread wheat breeding. the dissection of the lmw-gs gene family certainly would provide some evidence about the direct donors of the a genome of common wheat.

t. urartu and common wheat shared two genes, a3- <dig> and a3- <dig> . the allelic variants for each gene showed high identity , thus it was difficult to match the allelic variants between t. urartu and common wheat. the other two genes, tua3- <dig> and tua3- <dig> were unique to t. urartu . the i-type genes were present as haplotypes and showed high diversity in common wheat and t. urartu. except a3- <dig> shared by t. urartu and common wheat , the other i-type genes in common wheat were divided into five groups, from ia- <dig> to ia- <dig>  <cit> , of which ia- <dig>  and ia- <dig>  contained the same number of i-type genes with t. urartu . the tua3- <dig> genes showed close relationship with a3- <dig>  and a3-649- <dig> , and the tua3- <dig> genes showed higher identity with a3- <dig>  and a3-649- <dig>  than the other genes . thus, the characterized t. urartu might be the direct donor of the glu-a <dig> locus of common wheat varieties possessing i-type genes ia- <dig> and ia- <dig>  moreover, the i-type genes ia- <dig> and ia- <dig> should be the ancient genotypes because they had the same number of i-type genes with t. urartu and their genes closely matched those in t. urartu with high identity   <cit> . interestingly, group ia- <dig> were only detected from landraces in the micro-collection of chinese wheat germplasm, which also suggested that ia- <dig> might be an ancient genotype  <cit> . the ia- <dig> and ia- <dig> groups might also be derived from the characterized t. urartu because their i-type genes shared the same branch with tua3- <dig>  but ia- <dig> and ia- <dig> groups only contained one i-type genes, which shared higher identity with tua3- <dig> than tua3- <dig> . thus, in these genotypes, tua3- <dig> was lost due to a deletion and many snp mutations of tua3- <dig> were introduced during polyploidization. the ia- <dig> was a special group of i-type genes because all three genes were substantially different from the i-type genes in t. urartu . this group of i-type genes in common wheat might be derived from some other lmw-gs genotypes not detected in the present study, or they might have undergone many deletion and duplication processes during their evolution.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this work has promoted our understanding of the composition, variation, expression and evolution of lmw-gs genes in t. urartu. analysis of the geographic distribution of lmw-gs genes/variants and genotypes would facilitate the in situ conservation of the genetic diversity of t. urartu. these new lmw-gs genes/variants would broaden the genetic resources in wheat quality breeding and accelerate their application to improve bread-making quality in common wheat.
