BACKGROUND
the detection of resistance to erysiphe necator, the causal agent of grape powdery mildew, in two cultivars of vitis vinifera from central asia  <cit>  was intriguing given that this fungus was thought to have co-evolved with north american grape species, and that all v. vinifera cultivars were considered to be susceptible to this fungus. this discovery suggests that powdery mildew resistance is more complex than once thought and that other grape species may have played a role in the resistance found in these central asian cultivars. several grape species native to central asia and china are known to express powdery mildew resistance  <cit> , leading one to question the historical presence of powdery mildew in asia and the role asiatic species might have played in the evolution of resistance in present day cultivated grapes. addressing these questions would provide insight into the evolution of powdery mildew resistance and the forces driving grape diversity.

it is widely accepted that the cultivated form of v. vinifera subsp. sativa derived from its wild form v. vinifera subsp. sylvestris <cit> , which was once spread widely across western europe, the mediterranean, the caucasus, himalaya and hindu kush mountain ranges, and central asia  <cit> . the mountainous region between the caucasus and china is considered the center of diversity for many temperate fruit crops  <cit> . transitional types of grapes that included wild forms of the subsp. sylvestris, feral and cultivated land races and ancient local varieties were once common in this region  <cit> .

one of the key features separating domesticated grapes from their wild relatives is their reproductive system. wild relatives  are dioecious with anemophilous pollination while the domesticated grapevine is hermaphroditic in nature  <cit> . however, the origin and evolution of hermaphrodism in grape remains an open question. it is not known whether hermaphrodism evolved through sexual recombination, as a mutation of the wild form that was then introgressed into cultivated varieties, or as a mutation that originated in cultivated forms. cultivated grapevines have a very wide range of variation in fruit, leaf and growth characteristics, and there are thousands of varieties found worldwide  <cit> . the high amount of diversity is due to the long history of grapevine cultivation that dates back to  <dig> –  <dig> bc  <cit> . initially grape cultivation relied on both seed and vegetative propagation and was influenced by religion, regional traditions and human migration  <cit> . seeds may have been the more common means of propagation early in the cultivation of grapes as they were easier to transport over large distances and intentional and unintentional crosses generated great diversity within the cultivated types  <cit> .

historical records of grape growing in the orient and central asia are very limited  <cit> , however there is no indication of powdery mildew in available records from this region of the world. powdery mildew, caused by erysiphe necator, was first described on grapes in north america in  <dig>  it was discovered in europe in  <dig>  <cit>  and by  <dig>  it was reported throughout europe and the mediterranean region  <cit> . considering the long history of viticulture, the great attention paid to wine grapes, and the lack of any mention of this disease in historical records, it is unlikely that e. necator existed in europe prior to the early 1800s. frequent trade activity, including the exchange of plant material, facilitated the rapid spread of e. necator over long distances. many north american vitis species are resistant to mildew diseases and other pests  <cit> . their resistance to powdery mildew is attributed to coevolution with this fungal disease. on the other hand, the central asian forms of v. vinifera subsp. sativa were domesticated in the absence of powdery mildew pressure in the mountains of caucasus and surrounding areas, and these grapes lack resistance to powdery mildew. in the early to mid-1900s, extensive grape breeding programs were maintained in multiple states of the former soviet union, which used germplasm acquired from central asia, china, the trans-caucasus region, africa, and europe. powdery mildew resistance was an important goal for these breeding programs  <cit>  and resistance from the chinese species, especially v. amurensis was introgressed into cultivated varieties  <cit> . there are no historical records that indicate any other powdery mildew resistant chinese species were part of grape breeding in early 1900s  <cit> .

china was linked to central asia by both northern and southern silk routes and grape culture was flourishing by the second century ad  <cit> . although there are many diverse grape species in china, their impact on grape domestication is unknown  <cit> . this is in part due to the inaccessibility of germplasm, and historical and scientific records to the non-chinese speaking world. the presence of powdery mildew resistance in chinese grape species is unexplained. we do not know whether these species acquired resistance to fungal diseases after introduction of the disease from the new world  or whether powdery mildew and other fungal diseases were present in asia for a longer time period, but was not recorded in accessible historical records. the records available regarding grape breeding in central asia are limited to the early 1900s when the renowned russian geneticist nikolai i. vavilov initiated germplasm acquisition trips in central asia and neighboring regions  <cit> .

there were three major objectives to this investigation into the origins of powdery mildew resistance in cultivated v. vinifera subsp. sativa. the first was to evaluate a large collection of cultivated v. vinifera germplasm from central asia to identify additional powdery mildew resistant accessions using simple sequence repeats  markers linked to the powdery mildew resistance locus ren <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . we speculated that since there was breeding for powdery mildew resistance in central asia before the mid-1900s, there might be undocumented resistant selections, resistant parental material or new sources of resistant germplasm from this region. we analyzed accessions maintained in two of the world’s largest grape germplasm repositories  <cit> , and the department of viticulture and enology, and foundation plant services at the university of california, davis. the second objective was to evaluate the powdery mildew resistance in a range of chinese vitis species and in accessions of v. vinifera subsp. sylvestris collected from the regions of grapevine domestication, to determine if they were resistant to the disease and to identify potential contributors of powdery mildew resistance in central asian grape cultivars. an analysis of population structure and diversity was conducted to obtain a global perspective on the mechanisms of domestication, and gene flow from accessions of wild chinese species and v. vinifera subsp. sylvestris in an effort to determine the source of powdery mildew resistance detected in central asian v. vinifera cultivars. north american species and complex hybrids of these species resistant to powdery mildew were also included to determine their possible role in the resistance detected in central asian v. vinifera accessions. the third objective was to unravel potential parent-progeny relationships using kinship analysis to broaden the family of powdery mildew resistant cultivars for use by grape breeders.

RESULTS
identifying the unique germplasm set and ssr allele data
this study utilized grape accessions maintained in two of the world’s largest germplasm repositories: the inra domaine de vassal  collection; and combined collections housed at davis, california . most of the university of california, davis accessions were collected by harold p. olmo  during germplasm acquisition travels in  <dig> . many of the  <dig> accessions tested shared identical marker profiles, thus suggesting possible cases of synonymies were observed within and among the samples from the two collections . further analysis was based on  <dig> unique accessions:  <dig> from the davis collections and  <dig> from the inra domaine de vassal germplasm collection. additional file 3: table s <dig> presents the fingerprint profiles of the  <dig> unique accessions based on  <dig> ssr markers – one marker from each grape chromosome.

twenty-three accessions  were removed from the study set. the number of alleles per marker and percent of missing data were calculated for the remaining  <dig> genotypes with  <dig> markers . based on the collection records, the study set of  <dig> unique accessions consisted of  <dig> genotypes of v. vinifera subsp. sativa,  <dig> accessions of v. vinifera subsp. sylvestris, and  <dig> accessions of vitis species from northern pakistan, afghanistan and china. a minimum of  <dig> and maximum of  <dig> alleles were observed with ssr markers vviq <dig> and vviv <dig>  respectively. the average number of alleles for all markers was  <dig>  there were  <dig> markers with 5% or more accessions that had missing data .

search of germplasm resistant to powdery mildew and disease evaluation
prior to phenotypic evaluation for powdery mildew resistance, the entire set of  <dig> accessions was genotyped for linkage with the powdery mildew resistance locus ren <dig> at four ssr marker, which span  <dig>  cm genetic block on chromosome  <dig>   <cit> . the resistance-linked allele of  <dig>  defined by marker vmcng4e <dig>  was observed in  <dig> accessions that included v. amurensis, v. romanetii, muscadinia rotundifolia and wild v. vinifera subp. sylvestris accessions. the resistance-linked allele of  <dig>  defined by uvd <dig> marker was present in  <dig> accessions. the majority of the accessions with allele  <dig> for marker vmcng4e <dig>  did not have allele  <dig> at the marker udv <dig>  however, a missing allele at either marker could have been due to a recombination event. eleven accessions, including ‘karadzhandal’ and ‘kishmish vatkana’ had alleles that are in linkage with the ren <dig> locus at the two distal markers, vmcng4e <dig>  and udv <dig> that are in linkage with the ren <dig> locus . the germplasm set was then evaluated for alleles at sc47- <dig> and sc08-0071- <dig> that flank each side and co-segregates with the ren <dig> locus  <cit> . ‘karadzhandal’ and ‘kishmish vatkana’ fingerprint profiles were used to determine whether the allele of  <dig>  defined by the marker sc47- <dig> and the allele of  <dig>  defined by the marker sc08-0071- <dig> were linked to resistance. these are the two alleles that co-segregate with the ren <dig>  allele  <dig> for marker sc47- <dig> was common:  <dig> of the  <dig> accessions shared it. nearly all of the  <dig> accessions that carried the allele  <dig> for marker vmcng4e <dig>  also had allele  <dig> for marker sc47- <dig>  confirming the tight linkage between these two markers . the allele  <dig> for marker sc08-0071- <dig> was rare; only  <dig> accessions in the entire data set carried it . six accessions had the allele  <dig> for marker sc8-0071- <dig>  but did not carry the resistance-associated alleles at all tested markers . ‘khalchili’ and ‘khwangi’ had  <dig> flanked by  <dig> at sc47- <dig>  two of the v. vinifera subsp. sylvestris accessions had alleles  <dig> and  <dig> on the opposing flanks for marker vmcng4e <dig> ; ‘matrassa’ and a third sylvestris accession had the  <dig> allele and no resistance-associated allele on the opposite flank. these six accessions are potential recombinants. two chinese species accessions, v. romanetii  and v. yenshanensis  had the  <dig> allele, but neither of them carried a resistance-associated allele at the other three markers. in the case of these two examples, we speculate that the presence of the  <dig> allele is either due to size homoplasy, or the alleles at other markers are lost due to recombinations.

in  <dig> and  <dig>  resistance to powdery mildew was evaluated on a  <dig> to  <dig> scale  on all accessions from davis that carried alleles linked to resistance at one or more markers . four other accessions were evaluated in  <dig> . the year effect was significant; disease pressure was more severe in  <dig> . however, the susceptible controls were highly susceptible  and resistant controls had no or minor symptoms in three test years . the location in the field test plot was not significant, indicating that the close-spaced field evaluation site with no spray was an efficient and cost effective way to screen for resistance . ‘karadzhandal’, a known powdery mildew resistance accession was evaluated both years and had a powdery mildew resistance score of <  <dig>  ‘kishmish vatkana’ the other previously known powdery mildew resistant accession was under quarantine as part of the importation process and could not be evaluated. accessions with ren1-linked alleles at only one of the flanking markers exhibited no resistance to powdery mildew in the field test . the v. vinifera subsp. sativa cultivars: ‘husseine’, ‘khalchili’, ‘late vavilov’ and ‘sochal’ were resistant. these four accessions had mean scores for leaf and cane pm symptoms ranging from  <dig>  -  <dig>  in  <dig> and  <dig>  –  <dig>  in  <dig> . in  <dig>  in a much smaller evaluation, two accessions from wild v. vinifera subsp. sylvestris were identified as resistant from field evaluations: o34- <dig>  collected from shiravan, iran, had all four resistance-linked alleles; and dvit <dig> , collected from armenia, had the resistance allele at one of the flanking markers on each side. mean leaf symptoms scores were  <dig>  and  <dig>  for dvit <dig>  and o34- <dig>  respectively .

control plants of known resistant and susceptible accessions were used for both years.  results for all accessions tested in 2009;  results for accessions tested in 2010;  comparison of accessions that were common to both years. the number of field nursery beds and genotypes are noted.

*indicates statistically significant p values.

the powdery mildew resistant accession ‘karadzhandal’ at davis had similar marker profile to accession ‘kara djandjal’ and the newly identified resistant accession ‘husseine’ had identical marker profile to ‘kandari noir’ in the vassal collection. both of these accessions were found to be resistant in greenhouse screens carried out at vassal. ‘chirai oback’ and ‘vassarga tchernaia’, which had all four ren1-linked ssr marker alleles, were resistant based on greenhouse screening in france. the other two powdery mildew resistant accessions were ‘soïaki’, which had resistance-linked alleles with four markers, and ‘matrassa’, which had resistance-linked alleles with two markers on one side, have not been evaluated for disease symptoms. in total, this study identified and verified eight new accessions that are powdery mildew resistant. ‘soïaki’ and ‘matrassa’ were identified as potentially resistant based on marker analysis. their disease resistance needs to be verified in a field or greenhouse screen.

probability of identity and parent relationships
probability of identity analysis found that nine markers were sufficient to identify unique accessions in the study set . the paternity exclusion probability for a single locus ranged from  <dig> %  to  <dig> %  . a cumulated probability of exclusion of 100% was reached using only  <dig> markers for paternity and  <dig> markers for a parent pair. the simulation for parentage analysis identified a lod score threshold of  <dig>  to assess a potential single parent and  <dig>  to assess a parent pair with  <dig> ssr markers. six newly identified resistant accessions ‘husseine’, ‘chirai obak’, dvit <dig> , o34- <dig>  ‘soïaki’ and ‘matrassa’ were not related to any other accession in the set; two of these are v. vinifera subsp. sylvestris. the presence of powdery mildew resistance in unrelated genetic backgrounds is a very important result of this study that suggests that powdery mildew resistance in central asia is complex and potentially represent orthologous  and paralogous  homology for the ren <dig> locus, first identified in ‘karadzhandal’ and ‘kishmish vatkana’  <cit> . a second important inference from these results is that there may be many more powdery mildew resistant accessions within v. vinifera subsp. sativa and central asian vitis species and further exploration is needed. this resistance could be the result of intentional breeding efforts involving material collected and curated in the early 1900s at multiple institutes set up by the russian geneticist vavilov, or the result of unintentional breeding and selection of resistant material in an earlier period of domestication and selection over thousands of years. more importantly, identification of powdery mildew resistance in accessions of v. vinifera subsp. sylvestris indicates that the resistance is present in wild germplasm.

there were four parent-progeny relationships identified in this study; two involved the previously published powdery mildew resistant accessions . ‘vassarga tchernaia’ was conclusively identified as the female parent of ‘kishmish vatkana’; it also shared a parent-progeny relationship with ‘sochal’ although the direction of the cross is unknown. ‘karadzhandal’ and ‘late vavilov’ share one or both alleles with all  <dig> ssr markers . the powdery mildew resistant accession ‘khalchili’ was shown to have a first-degree relationship to ‘yarghouti’ .

sequencing of the resistance-linked allele of an ssr marker that co-segregates with ren1
a  <dig> bp region that includes the resistance associated  <dig> bp allele from marker sc8-0071- <dig> was sequenced for the  <dig> powdery mildew resistant accessions and two susceptible v. vinifera subsp. sylvestris . two accessions of chinese species that had a  <dig> bp fragment at sc8-0071- <dig> were also sequenced. the sequences were nearly identical for all fourteen v. vinifera accessions except for occasional single nucleotide polymorphisms  between both unrelated and genetically related accessions. the sequences of the two chinese species, v. romanetii  and v. yenshanensis  were very different from one another and from the v. vinifera sequence, obvious examples of size homoplasy, where two alleles are identical in size but result from independent events .

expanded genetic analysis
for the  <dig> powdery mildew resistant accessions, including the two previous known powdery mildew resistant accessions ‘kishmish vatkana’ and ‘karadzhandal’, genetic analysis was expanded to a  <dig> cm genomic block with six ssr markers including the ren <dig> region . six of the newly identified powdery mildew resistant accessions, including o34- <dig>  a v. vinifera subsp. sylvestris, had similar alleles similar to ‘kishmish vatkana’, and ‘karadzhandal’ with six ssr markers . ssr marker allelic comparison of two other resistant accessions indicated that a recombination event had occurred between markers at different junctions. the wild subsp. sylvestris accession, dvit <dig>  had complex allelic combination of markers surrounding the ren <dig> region suggesting a different genetic origin of powdery mildew resistance.

genetic diversity
the genetic diversity of the core set of  <dig> central asian accessions was evaluated with hierarchical clustering , principle coordinate analysis , and a model-based clustering method implemented in the program structure. all three analysis methods generated three groups with data from  <dig>  or  <dig> markers. the delta k value calculated from the output of structure was  <dig>  at k =  <dig> compared to less than  <dig>  at all other values of k. the three groups determined by pcoa were similar to those produced by structure . the q-values  assigned by structure for  <dig> accessions in three groups are displayed in additional file 9: table s <dig> 

group a  contained  <dig> vitis species accessions, nearly all of which originated in china. the q-value for membership in this group was  <dig>  or above for  <dig> accessions. vitis yenshanensis  and b-166- <dig>  an accession labeled as vitis spp., both collected from china had q-values split between the group a and b. a second v. yenshanensis  accession, also collected from china, had q values split between group a and c. ‘khir ghuluman’, collected by h.p. olmo in afghanistan, had q-values split among all three groups indicating it was a possible hybrid of a local species and cultivated varieties. ‘khir ghuluman’ was labeled as v. vinifera, presumably because it is a cultivated variety in afghanistan. none of the previous and newly identified powdery mildew resistant accessions were in this group.

group b  contained  <dig> samples, a mix of both v. vinifera cultivars and wild v. vinifera subsp. sylvestris accessions. three new powdery mildew resistant accessions were placed in this group with q-values of  <dig>  and higher. o34- <dig> and dvit <dig>  were collected as subsp. sylvestris, and ‘matrassa’  was collected as subsp. sativa. for clarity, this group will be referred to as o34- <dig> from this point onward in the manuscript. thirty-nine accessions collected as subsp. sylvestris were in this group,  <dig> of which had q-values of  <dig>  or higher. two chinese vitis species accessions,  <dig> a  and b-166- <dig>  were in this group, and are most likely hybridized forms. all four accessions of v. jacquemontii collected from pakistan were also in this group. the q values of these accessions, one as high as  <dig> , suggest that these accessions are not pure species and may be hybrid or mislabeled forms .

group c  was named after ‘thompson seedless’ to indicate that the group consists primarily of table grape cultivars. two previously identified and seven of the new powdery mildew resistant accessions were in this group . the group consisted of  <dig> accessions labeled as v. vinifera subsp. sativa and one accession of subsp. sylvestris – o35- <dig> collected from iran by h.p. olmo. the q values for this particular accession placed it in groups a and c. ‘kala khostan’ with a group c q-value of  <dig>  is the only other accession in this group with association to the species group. all but  <dig> of the remaining  <dig> accessions had group tsl q-values of  <dig>  or higher .

the results of the pcoa analysis with  <dig> markers also produced three groups. the species group was clearly separated from the other two groups. the distinction between the o34- <dig> group and the tsl group was less clear . the o34- <dig> group contained nearly all of the subsp. sylvestris accessions, however within that group, there was no clear distinction between the cultivated and wild forms .

to differentiate the wild sylvestris accessions from cultivated sativa forms, further analyses focused on only the o34- <dig> group. the ward and upgma hierarchical clustering methods divided the  <dig> accessions of the o34- <dig> group into two clades. seventy-six cultivated v. vinifera subsp. sativa accessions, including the powdery mildew resistant ‘matrassa’ were in one group, and the second group consisted of  <dig> sativa and sylvestris accessions. when the ward clustering method was applied to this second group of mixed accessions, there were again two clades. twenty of the sylvestris accessions grouped with four cultivated accessions  . these four v. vinifera accessions are ancient cultivars and are likely transitional forms with the wild ancestor sylvestris. the powdery mildew resistant accession dvit <dig>  was in this clade. the second clade had three less well-defined sub groups: the first contained six sylvestris accessions including the powdery mildew resistant accession o34-16; the second group contained accessions of v. vinifera subsp. sativa collected from pakistan and turkmenistan and one accession labeled v. jacquemontii; and the third group was a mix of wild sylvestris or feral types that were collected from iran, iraq, turkmenistan, pakistan and russia, and five incorrectly identified accessions – three of which were labeled as v. jacquemontii, and the other two were collected from china.

two distinct clades were revealed when clustering analysis  was applied to the  <dig> wild sylvestris accessions . the first clade contained ten sylvestris accessions obtained from turkmenistan, four accessions from iran and two from afghanistan. the turkmenistan accessions were collected from the kopet dag mountain range, which defines the border between turkmenistan and iran on the east of the caspian sea. the powdery mildew resistant accession o34- <dig>  collected near the town of shirvan, iran, was in this clade. shirvan is near mashhad, an important trade hub on the ancient silk route located on the other side of the kopet dag mountain range . therefore, it was not surprising to see these accessions positioned in one clade. the second clade consisted of accessions collected from georgia, armenia and iran. the powdery mildew resistant sylvestris accession dvit <dig> , collected from alaverdi, armenia, was in this group. these results in conjunction with analyses that included the entire o34- <dig> group suggest that the two wild sylvestris accessions could have acquired powdery mildew resistance from different genetic backgrounds.

gene diversity indices  for each group are shown in table  <dig>  the average fis value for the species group  was higher than the other two groups. this group consisted of only  <dig> accessions as compared to  <dig> accessions in the o34- <dig> group and  <dig> accessions in the tsl group. the average fis for the o34- <dig> group was  <dig> ; expected heterozygosity was higher than observed for all but one of the  <dig> markers. the average near zero fis value for the tsl group  suggests that they are a panmictic population in hardy-weinberg equilibrium. values for the differentiation index  among the three groups were very low  . these results indicate that there is no clear differentiation among these groups due to the presence of transitional forms that bridge the groups and indicate active gene flow among them, implying that domestication and selection is underway.

distinguishing wild and cultivated types by flower phenotype
because two of the newly discovered powdery mildew resistant accessions were collected as sylvestris, it was important to confirm their true type based on morphological traits. flower sex phenotype and seed morphology are two key criteria used to differentiate subsp. sylvestris  from cultivated sativa forms . the flower phenotype of the subsp. sylvestris accessions collected from armenia, georgia and turkmenistan could not be determined because they were young potted plants. flower phenotype data for  <dig> wild v. vinifera accessions was obtained from grin, the national germplasm resource information network  <cit> . a combination of two dna markers was used to differentiate male, hermaphrodite and female flower phenotype for the set of  <dig> accessions. field phenotypic observations for the  <dig> accessions from the vassal collection matched the flower phenotype predicted by dna analysis with only one exception – ‘yhsouh ali’ , which was recorded as a female, but dna analysis indicated it was a hermaphrodite. these test results indicate that the combination of both markers is a reliable system to determine flower phenotype.

dna marker-based flower phenotyping of the  <dig> wild forms of v. vinifera subsp. sylvestris and all ten newly discovered powdery mildew resistant accessions are presented in table 4; the results for all other accessions are presented in additional file 11: table s <dig>  the flower phenotype was undetermined for  <dig> accessions due to amplification failure with one or both markers. phenotypic observations differed from genotypic results for only three accessions. two accessions in the species group, c-166- <dig> and dvit <dig> , are recorded as male, but are hermaphrodite based on the dna analysis. the third anomaly was the cultivar ‘neeli’ , which was scored as a hermaphrodite, but is listed as a female plant in the grin database.

the apt <dig> marker is capable of distinguishing female-flowered vines from males or hermaphrodites. the second marker, vvib <dig> has a unique allele linked to the hermaphrodism. with the combination of these markers, flower phenotypes could be reliably determined . flower phenotypes of the  <dig> powdery mildew resistant subsp. sativa are also detailed with these two markers. powdery mildew resistant genotypes are in bold font.

dna marker analysis of flower sex in the v. vinifera subsp. sativa group of cultivars found that  <dig> were hermaphrodite,  <dig> were female, and five were identified as male . one of the five males, ‘kala kostan’  is recorded as a female in grin; the flower phenotype could not be verified for the other four genotypically male cultivars.

eighteen of the  <dig> v. vinifera subsp. sylvestris accessions were male, including newly identified powdery mildew resistant accession, dvit <dig> . eight accessions were female, including resistant accession o34- <dig> . fourteen others were hermaphrodite.

seeds were extracted from ten of the wild sylvestris that h.p. olmo collected from iran and afghanistan . the combined results from seed morphology  and flower sex phenotyping, revealed that  <dig> accessions designated as sylvestris are likely not pure sylvestris, but instead hybridized forms of native wild species and cultivated varieties. interestingly, three accessions from h.p. olmo’s o series, which are male, based on genotypic analysis, bear fruit . the flower phenotype of the accession o34- <dig>  was scored differently in each of three years on grin  <cit> . similarly, observations of the flower phenotype for o34- <dig> on grin varied from year-to-year between hermaphrodite and female. o35- <dig>  the third genotypically male accession has been recorded as a hermaphrodite  <cit> .

the flower sex of the  <dig> powdery mildew resistant accessions was also determined: the sativa accessions ‘husseine’ ‘soïaki’, ‘sochal’, and ‘vassarga tchernaia’ are female vines; the other six including ‘kishmish vatkana’ and ‘karadzhandal’ are hermaphrodites . two of the new powdery mildew resistant accessions are clearly v. vinifera subsp. sylvestris. o34- <dig> is a female vine with obvious wild type seed morphology . the accession dvit <dig>  is a male flowered v. vinifera subsp. sylvestris.

discussion
in this study, we exploited available genetic information on the powdery mildew resistance locus ren <dig> to identify additional germplasm that shared a ren1-like local haplotype, and then attempted to clarify the evolution of powdery mildew resistance and its domestication in cultivated v. vinifera subsp. sativa. ten new powdery mildew resistant accessions were discovered that possess a ren1-like local haplotype, which was earlier identified in ‘kishmish vatkana’ and ‘dzhandzhal kara’  from central asia  <cit> . we discovered that powdery mildew resistance is present in two v. vinifera subsp. sylvestris accessions, a taxon considered to be the progenitor of the cultivated form sativa. four of the resistant accessions ‘vassarga tchernaia’, ‘chirai ’, ‘late vavilov’ and ‘khalchili’ are obscure varieties with few records in the vitis international variety catalog  <cit>  or the european vitis database  <cit> . the first three accessions were obtained from germplasm collections in uzbekistan, tajikistan, and turkmenistan, respectively; harold p. olmo collected ‘khalchili’ from afghanistan in  <dig>  the other four resistant sativa accessions are better known. ‘husseine’ was also collected from afghanistan and it is available worldwide with records in  <dig> germplasm collections with  <dig> synonyms. ‘matrassa’ was acquired from the azerbaijan collection, and is available in  <dig> collections with  <dig> synonyms. ‘soïaki’  is found in  <dig> collections with  <dig> synonyms. ‘matrassa’ and ‘soïaki’ are listed by russian grape breeders as cultivars for high quality table, sparkling and dessert wines  <cit> . the eighth resistant sativa accession ‘sochal’ is only held at two collection sites in the usa. plant inventory records indicate that cuttings of ‘sochal’ were obtained in  <dig> from the n. i. vavilov institute of plant industry, leningrad. eight of the newly identified accessions carrying ren1-like local haplotypes were acquired from five neighboring countries of central asia and the caucasus, all major junctions for trade on the ancient silk route for thousands of years. it is not hard to believe that selected grape germplasm, favored for desirable fruit characteristics, was moved back and forth in the form of seeds and cuttings from one region to another, where they were likely crossed with local varieties in remote isolated valleys and villages in different regions.

in addition to the identification of eight new powdery mildew resistant accessions, this study also gathered information on the genealogical relationships. a likelihood-based method that determines potential parent progeny relationships without any prior knowledge revealed four first-degree relationships. we identified ‘vassarga tchernaia’ as the female parent of ‘kishmish vatkana’ and verified ‘thompson seedless’ as the male parent  <cit> . ‘vassarga tchernaia’ and ‘sochal’ shared a first-degree relationship, sharing at least one allele at  <dig> markers. both are female vines with reflexed stamens and seeded fruit. it is difficult to determine the direction of the relationship between ‘sochal’ and ‘vassarga tchernaia’. nevertheless, both of them are female vines, resistant to powdery mildew, and produce seeded fruit. ‘sochal’, ‘vassarga tchernaia’ and ‘kismish vatkana’ are not found in historical collection/breeding records and may have been disregarded due to undesirable fruit attributes, e.g. loose clusters, and small seeded berries, which did not satisfy selection criteria for that particular region. the other two first-degree relationships identified in this study were between ‘late vavilov’ and ‘karadzhandal’, and between ‘khalchili’ and the powdery mildew susceptible ‘yarghouti’. all four are hermaphrodites and only ‘karadzhandal’ is well known with a recorded history  <cit> . one of the important findings of this study is that four of the new powdery mildew resistant cultivars ‘chirai obak’, ‘husseine’, ‘matrassa’ and ‘soiaki’ are not directly related to any other accession in this study or in the complete vassal collection  <cit> . this implies that the story of powdery mildew resistance in cultivated varieties is complex and what we have revealed in this study may not be the complete picture due to extinction or missing cultivars in our collections. it is likely that a thorough search of germplasm collections in central asia would unearth more resistant germplasm.

with the exception of ‘matrassa’, structure placed all seven new subsp. sativa powdery mildew resistant cultivars in the tsl group, even though they were collected from different regions of central asia. these results suggest that selection and active flow of desirable plant material was common in this region of grape domestication and that multiple breeding efforts were underway to satisfy the local tastes for quality grapes. the tsl group also indicates that breeding efforts were also directed at seedlessness as ‘thompson seedless’, one of the ancient varieties, was a popular parent for a large number of table grape cultivars  <cit> .

two of the resistant accessions in this study belong to the subsp. sylvestris, which prompts many questions. are these two accessions truly wild sylvestris that have never been cultivated or are they hybrids between wild and cultivated forms? what is the direction of the gene flow for powdery mildew resistance – did these two sylvestris accessions acquire resistance from cultivated forms or did the resistance come from wild types to cultivated forms? o34- <dig> is a female vine with seeded fruit, and seed shape typical of the sylvestris type grapes – small round seeds and short beaks. the accession dvit <dig>  is a male vine. dioecy is one of the key traits distinguishing the wild sylvestris from the cultivated sativa. additionally, the male flower phenotype is only associated with wild vitis species  <cit> . according to the model of antcliff  <cit> , flower phenotype is controlled by a single major locus with three alleles: male  dominant to hermaphrodite , which is dominant to the female . in the wild, one should find only male and female vines in the absence of gene flow from hermaphroditic cultivated varieties. in the case of gene flow from cultivated forms to wild types, one does not expect to observe male flower phenotypes in the progeny; we expect to see a 1: <dig> ratio of hermaphrodite to female vines but no male vines when wild female flower cluster is fertilized with pollen from a cultivated hermaphrodite. in the case of a gene flow from wild types to cultivated forms, where a heterozygous wild male pollinating a cultivated heterozygous hermaphrodite or a cultivated female vine, one would expect to see a 2:1: <dig> ratio of males, hermaphrodites and females, or 1: <dig> ratio of male to female, respectively. the sylvestris accessions in this study were collected as seeds. eighteen of them were reported to be males, eight as females and fourteen as hermaphrodites. the occurrence of hermaphrodites in the supposed wild material is proof of gene flow from cultivated to wild germplasm. gene flow from cultivated grapes to wild sylvestris is thought to be common  <cit> . it is important that future work on wild grape germplasm focuses on all morphological attributes of the material under study and not only flower phenotype, as female vines are not uncommon with gene flow from cultivated to wild forms.

we sequenced a  <dig> bp fragment that included the  <dig> bp resistance-linked allele of sc8-0071- <dig>  <cit> . the sequence of this region for all the resistant accessions matched with the sequences of the two previously described alleles linked tightly to ren <dig> with occasional snps between genetically related and unrelated accessions. the occurrence of snps between parental and progeny genomic fragments is likely due to the accumulation of somatic mutations over multiple cycles of vegetative propagation. vegetative or clonal propagation of grapes is an ancient practice used to maintain desirable cultivars. the occurrence of somatic mutations in grapes, some resulting in significant phenotypic differences is well documented  <cit> . there is no historical record for most of the powdery mildew resistant plant material identified in this study. it is impossible to determine the number of clonal variants of these varieties that may have existed at different times in different regions. the vines sampled for this study are, of necessity, separated by multiple cycles of vegetative propagation from the actual parent vines and the ortet involved in the natural or purposeful crosses that occurred possibly hundreds or thousands of years ago.

genetic analysis expanded to a  <dig> cm genomic fragment with six linked ssr markers  revealed that six of the powdery mildew resistant accessions, including the sylvestris o34- <dig> had an allelic profile for this region that matched the two haplotypes known to carry ren <dig>  it is most likely that individuals sharing an identical allelic profile for such a large fragment of dna, 40% of chromosome  <dig>  also share powdery mildew resistance with the same ancestral lineage, which is further supported by the fact that three of the above six resistant accessions are related to the previously identified accessions that carry ren <dig> co-segregating alleles .

several key questions arise from this study. did the group of powdery mildew resistant accessions, now numbering  <dig> from a variety of regions, acquire resistance after the introduction of north american powdery mildew into the old world, or was powdery mildew present in central asia and china prior to early  <dig> thus allowing disease resistance to evolve over a longer time period? this latter possibility seems unlikely given the number of accessions identified in this study carrying unbroken introgression of  <dig> cm genomic region. this is highly suggestive of recent events of hybridization and introgression. is it possible that resistance to powdery mildew is also associated with resistance to other pathogens prevalent in central asia, and if so, which pathogens? to address these questions, one must first better understand the history of grape domestication in central asia, the past and current biodiversity of this region’s grape germplasm, and be able to deduce information from the molecular nature and evolutionary structural organization of disease resistance genes in the ren <dig> locus.

the historical accounts based on archeological digs and observations of natural and cultivated populations of grapevines  <cit>  consider that large scale cultivation of v. vinifera existed in transcaucasia about  <dig>  –  <dig>  bc, spread to north africa by the end of 5th millennium bc, and during 1st millennium bc, grape culture was established in europe  <cit> . these reports state that cultivation of v. vinifera was established in afghanistan and the oases of central asia by the fourth century bc, and that its culture reached china in the second century bc. despite all this information, there are many gaps in our understanding of grape culture in the ancient world. we do not know whether central asia, the near east and china were in contact in the earliest phases of development of grape culture, although there is evidence of wine making in these cultures around  <dig>  bc  <cit> . there is no information available on the influence of chinese vitis species in the long history of grape domestication, even though china harbors as many as  <dig> vitis species  <cit> , and some of them are resistant to powdery and downy mildew  <cit> . given the small number of chinese accessions sampled in this study set, it is difficult to assess the direct role and genetic contribution of the chinese species and other indigenous native species in shaping the morphologically diverse wild sylvestris populations in central asia. most importantly, historical grape literature is devoid of information on the presence of diseases and pests in central asia, they are not noted widely until the early  <dig> s. the only disease of grapevine thought to have originated in the region of grape domestication is grapevine fanleaf virus  <cit> . in the distant past, people may have viewed plant diseases very differently due to a lack of detailed understanding, perhaps resulting in the dearth of historical records. the existence of a greater natural biodiversity in ancient times, which helped to regulate undesirable pests and diseases, is also possible. then the process of domestication, which emphasized clonal propagation and monoculture lead to biological simplicity resulting in more noticeable incidences of disease outbreaks. it is well known that greater genetic diversity confers at least partial resistance to diseases that are specific to certain strains of pathogens. the developing understanding of resistance to grape powdery mildew disease suggests that resistance is often strain specific  <cit> .

based on seed morphology, leaf characteristics, flower phenotype, and diversity analyses, o34- <dig> is most likely a true sylvestris. sequence comparison and linkage analysis in this study and organization of underlying genes in previous study  <cit>  provides highly suggestive evidence that powdery mildew resistance represented by the cluster of genes in the ren <dig> locus was introgressed from the wild progenitor. the principal genes of the ren <dig> locus belong to the nbs-lrr family. this group of genes has a clustered organization that enables resistance to evolve in concert with changing pest and disease strains. previous work by coleman et al.  <cit>  analyzed the structural organization of nbs-lrr genes in the ren <dig> locus region and concluded that one of the factors that contribute to the chaotic arrangement of genes in this region is intragenic recombination between tandemly arrayed paralogs. the results presented in this study provide clues that a wild progenitor played an active role in the evolution of powdery mildew resistance, which potentially evolved over a long period of sexual reproduction, and was later, bred and selected into cultivated forms. it is also probable that two different accessions of sylvestris had different genetic background of resistance, thus providing unique opportunity to expand the gene pool for powdery mildew resistance breeding. the comparative sequence analysis of resistance genes from the two sylvestris accessions would be very useful to gain further insight into the evolution of powdery mildew resistance in central asia in the absence of the pathogen. it is also possible that powdery mildew disease existed in the old world for longer than we currently assume and that resistance in wild populations evolved over a longer time period through sexual recombination.

the main function of plant nbs-lrr proteins is to specifically recognizes pathogen effectors and to initiate and control defense response that severely limit pathogen growth  <cit> . several studies have determined varied sites of pre-activation and post-activation localization of nb-lrr proteins. expanded functions beyond pathogen recognition are likely due to evolutionarily flexible nb-lrr interfaces integrated in other cellular machinery as part of their immune surveillance function  <cit> . additionally, an ancient sub-clade of nb-lrr proteins can 'help' amplify the function of nb-lrr proteins that sense pathogens  <cit> . we scanned the pn <dig> reference genome and found that the ren <dig> locus in this mildew susceptible cultivar co-segregates with  <dig> nb-lrr genes, with the highest identity with cc-nbs-lrr disease resistance genes from soybean  and potato   <cit> . sequence comparison and functional characterization of cloned nb-lrr genes from the resistant accessions we describe and the susceptible reference haplotype are necessary to determine any of the nb-lrr genes in this interval are responsible for the powdery mildew phenotypes we describe here.

CONCLUSIONS
this international collaboration discovered  <dig> new powdery mildew resistant v. vinifera accessions that will prove invaluable to grape breeding programs focused on high quality fruit and strong resistance to powdery mildew. this discovery also forces a reevaluation of grape evolution in its widely considered center of domestication. the results support the notion that mildew resistance was present in wild species and potentially evolved via sexual recombination. the fact that many of the parent progeny relationships discovered here involved crosses of two self-pollinating hermaphroditic parents further supports the existence of grape breeders and their intentional hybridization efforts. further evidence of breeding activities is documented by the existence of ‘thompson seedless’ in the parentage of many seedless grapes from central asia. we cannot determine the time period when what appears to be very active grape breeding occurred with the fingerprint database created here, but given the lack of a historical record it seems that these breeding efforts may have occurred hundreds or thousands of years ago. the discovery of powdery mildew resistance in chinese grape species and the possible transport and role of these species in grape breeding along the asian trade routes is also intriguing. however, with the limited amount of chinese grape germplasm, we were unable to prove this occurred with the data presented here. comparative sequencing of multiple lines of ren <dig> from different regions and species would greatly aid our understanding of the evolution of powdery mildew resistance. finally, it is clear that additional collections of central asian grape germplasm are needed to fully understand grape evolution, discover additional sources of mildew resistance, and ensure the survival of this historic and valuable resource.
