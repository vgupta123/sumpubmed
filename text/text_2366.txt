BACKGROUND
the sex chromosomes of mammals shared a common evolutionary history before acquiring different roles in sex determination but have been shaped differently by divergent selective pressures in the last  <dig> myr. the human y chromosome bears many genes essential for male fertility. in fact, testicular differentiation, the primary event in sex determination, is triggered by the y-linked gene sry. moreover, the association of spermatogenic impairment with the presence of microscopic deletions on the long arm of the y chromosome  <cit> , contributed to the definition of three different regions on yq that are crucial for spermatogenesis - the azoospermia factor regions . the azfb and azfc regions are arranged in repetitive sequence blocks with palindromic structure and are recurrently deleted in infertile patients due to intrachromosomal recombination  <cit> . the azfa region does not have the same palindromic structure, but deletions are provoked in a similar way to the azfb and c regions by flanking direct repeats leading to misalignment and unequal recombination between sister chromatids  <cit> .

several candidate genes have been found within the azf regions, which are expressed at different stages of germ cell differentiation, but their precise function in spermatogenesis has not been fully characterised yet  <cit> . the lack of functional information on these genes is mainly due to two reasons: i) typically the deletions remove simultaneously more than one gene, hindering the establishment of genotype-phenotype correlations; ii) an appropriate animal model to study the function of human y-linked genes in spermatogenesis is lacking. in fact, due to the accelerated rate of evolution of the y chromosome  <cit>  there are great differences in gene content across mammalian y chromosomes, even between closely related species. a striking example is the fact that four genes on the chimpanzee y chromosome, with active orthologues on the human y, bear disrupting mutations  <cit> . one is usp9y, a gene in the human azfa region that is thought to have an important role in spermatogenesis, reviewed in  <cit> . mammalian spermatogenesis has been intensively studied in mus musculus but, although some of the genes within the human azf regions have orthologues on mouse yp, the single gene that has been proven to be crucial for spermatogenesis in mice, eif2s3y  <cit> , does not have a y-linked human counterpart. conversely, the human y chromosome is also characterised by the presence of genes acquired recently in primate evolution, which are absent from the mouse. therefore, to gain a better understanding of the spermatogenic process and to identify the genes that are fundamental for male fertility in humans it is of paramount importance to characterise all human y-linked genes.

the finished sequence of the human y chromosome  <cit>  has provided a complete list of male-specific genes. many are multi-copy transcripts expressed in testis, while others are single copy and have homologues on the x chromosome. classically, the latter have been thought to be ubiquitous proteins that perform basic maintenance functions in all cell types. however, the finding of different regulation during spermatogenesis for the y-linked gene  and its x homologue has proved that this generalization is inadequate and has prompted us to perform an in depth characterisation of both x- and y-linked genes of x-y homologous pairs.

spermatogenesis is the complex process through which spermatozoa are formed and consists of both mitotic and meiotic divisions, and of morphological cell differentiation involving dramatic changes in the transcriptome and proteome of the germ cells. it is therefore not surprising that the study of mouse germline gene expression has revealed a unique repertoire of transcripts derived from genes, or variants of genes, that are only expressed during male gametogenesis  <cit> .

following a careful literature and database search we selected for further analysis those single-copy y chromosome genes that were still poorly characterised and presented novel alternative transcripts, as well as their homologues on the x chromosome. we determined the expression patterns of  <dig> different transcripts in a panel of human tissues and in biopsies of infertile patients, in an attempt to identify new testis-specific isoforms involved in germ cell development in humans. most isoforms analysed were detected in testis and one gene, belonging to the human ribosomal s <dig> family , showed restricted expression in testis and prostate, in contrast with its x-linked homologue, which was ubiquitously expressed.

eukaryotic ribosomal protein s <dig>  is x-linked in mammals  <cit>  and a y-linked homologue  is present in all primate lineages analysed to date  <cit> . in humans, a second copy of the y-linked gene  was described  <cit>  which originated by duplication before the radiation of old world monkeys, approximately  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . the report where rps4y <dig> was first described includes conflicting information regarding its expression pattern  <cit> . andr√©s et al.  <cit>  performed an evolutionary analysis of the rps4xy gene family in primates and claimed testis-specific expression for rps4y <dig> in humans but they have not presented any supporting evidence. we have now characterised the expression patterns of all the coding isoforms encoded by this gene family and found different breadth of expression for the transcripts encoded by each gene, but also for alternative transcripts arising from the same gene, and we have confirmed restricted expression for rps4y <dig> in testis and prostate. moreover, we have determined by highly specific quantitative real time pcr that rps4y <dig> is more highly expressed in testis biopsies containing germ cells. finally, we performed comparative modelling of the three human rps <dig> proteins, in order to evaluate the structural context of the differences observed between these proteins and to try to predict their functional impact.

RESULTS
expression patterns of x/y isoforms in human tissues
for each x/y gene pair a careful search for protein-coding alternative transcripts was performed in several databases: ensembl http://www.ensembl.org, ncbi http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ and at the ucsc genome browser http://genome.ucsc.edu/. we specially focused on those isoforms presenting different utrs , since these are most likely to incorporate different regulatory regions, and did not aim to characterise any isoforms that would give rise to truncated proteins and/or lacking relevant functional domains. in some cases it was not possible to distinguish very similar isoforms transcribed by the same locus or highly homologous genomic sequences, such as eif2s3x and its autosomal copy.

we analysed the expression patterns of  <dig> different transcripts in a panel of  <dig> somatic tissues plus testis and ovary, by standard end point rt-pcr, using isoform-specific primers . all y chromosome isoforms and most x-linked ones were expressed in testis but the majority were also present in other tissues . in some cases, unexpected bands were present in the gel, indicating the presence of additional transcripts. none of these extra bands suggested restricted expression in testis and therefore were not relevant to the present study. in the ovary, none of the y-linked isoforms were detected, confirming the specificity of the primers used.

interestingly, we found different expression patterns for the genes encoding each of the proteins of the ribosomal s <dig> family . while the canonical rps4x transcript, corresponding to the full length orf  was expressed in almost all tissues surveyed, the y-linked isoforms were somewhat more restricted, rps4y <dig> being only found in testis and prostate . an alternative, protein-coding transcript arising from rps4x is annotated in ensembl , which results in a shorter protein. this transcript was only detected in small intestine, thymus and spleen and at vestigial levels in brain. the analysis of this gene family revealed that only one of the y-linked transcripts is more widely expressed, rps4y1- <dig> , and therefore the remaining transcripts are good candidates for a male-specific function. the two rps4y <dig> transcripts incorporate alternative first exons, rps4y1- <dig> giving rise to a protein with an n-terminus nine amino acids longer, as compared to the canonical protein encoded by rps4y1- <dig> . the sequence available in ensembl for rps4y1- <dig> lacks a termination codon and a 3'utr; nevertheless, we have detected by race-pcr, using a forward primer specific for rps4y1- <dig>  a full length transcript incorporating the whole orf and 3'utr of rps4y <dig> as well as a poly a tail .

in addition to the canonical rps4y <dig> transcript , in testis and prostate we detected a longer transcript arising from this locus that incorporates a previously uncharacterised exon, located between exons  <dig> and  <dig>  however, the in silico translation of the corresponding mrna resulted in a truncated protein, due to the presence of an early stop codon. we performed a race-pcr specific for that transcript but were unable to get any evidence for the existence of an alternative upstream sequence that could give rise to a non-truncated orf . therefore, it is not clear if this alternative transcript has a functional role, although a putative regulatory function cannot be ruled out. in prostate, a third rps4y <dig> transcript was detected but, since this isoform was only expressed in this tissue, we did not further characterise it.

to determine the relative abundance of the different transcripts in testis we performed quantitative real time pcr in commercially available testis rna derived from a pool of three males  and compared the detection threshold of each transcript to that of beta actin. rps4x- <dig> is the most highly expressed of all the three ribosomal proteins s <dig> analysed. rps4y1- <dig>  is the second most abundant rps <dig> transcript while rps4y <dig> is the least abundant .

* difference in the detection threshold of each target to beta actin is presented  in a pool of total testis rna derived from three males .

expression of ribosomal s <dig> genes in testis biopsies
the testis is a complex organ, where several spermatogenic and somatic cell types co-exist. to determine the cell type from which the transcripts detected in testis are arising we compared the expression levels of each rps <dig> transcript in a set of testicular biopsies of infertile patients that do not present known y chromosome deletions . this biopsy material had been previously characterised by histology and global expression profiling  <cit> . by conventional end-point rt-pcr all isoforms were detected in both groups of samples , except rps4y <dig> that was only present in the biopsies containing spermatogenic cells . these results suggested that rps4y <dig> is expressed in the germ cells.

due to the weak amplification signal obtained from biopsy samples we have performed a method known to be more sensitive, quantitative real time rt-pcr, with a rps4y <dig> taqman probe designed to discriminate rps4y <dig> from the two other paralogues. using this approach we detected rps4y <dig> cdna in all of the samples analysed, but the expression levels of the gene were approximately four times higher in the samples of biopsies from individuals with conserved spermatogenesis, when compared to those from azoospermic patients . the high heterogeneity observed within the group of samples from patients subjected to vasectomy may reflect variation in the cell type content in the seminiferous tubules of these patients. in all cases Œîct  was equal to or greater than  <dig>  confirming the low expression levels of the gene.

analysis of rps4y <dig> promoter region
rps4y <dig> has originated from rps4y <dig> through duplication and a blast alignment of the genomic sequence upstream the transcription start site of the two genes indicates that the  <dig> bp of the 5'-flanking sequence of y <dig>  on yq <dig> , were derived from the y <dig> sequence, on yp <dig>  . however, there are several sequence differences between the two genes in this region that may underlie their different expression patterns. yoshihama et al.  <cit>  have performed an extensive analysis of the promoter regions of human ribosomal genes and found that transcription always starts at a c residue within a characteristic oligopyrimidine tract. this sequence element is disrupted by a c-to-g mutation in rps4y <dig>  which may contribute to the more restricted expression pattern of this gene. additionally, the human rps4y <dig> mrna af <dig>  includes a 5'utr that extends beyond that position, indicating that rps4y <dig> transcription starts further upstream the atg, in a different sequence context.

in the analysis of expression presented above we have detected both rps4y <dig> transcripts predicted by ensembl, by anchoring the primers in the alternative utrs. our results indicate that in some instances rps4y <dig> transcription may also start upstream the described oligopyrimidine tract. the utr of rps4y1- <dig> is similar to the sequence upstream the start codon of rps4y2; rps4y1- <dig> transcription starts  <dig> bp downstream of the first atg, within the first intron of the gene. interestingly, there is a short oligopyrimidine tract  immediately upstream this alternative atg. in the corresponding position of rps4y <dig> intron, the atg is not present, due to a mutation.

using matinspector  <dig>  we have searched for binding sites for transcription factors in the  <dig> bp of genomic sequence upstream the start codon of rps4y <dig> and the corresponding sequence of rps4y <dig> . in both genes several putative binding sites were predicted with high scores , in forward and in reverse orientation . we also run tfsearch http://www.cbrc.jp/research/db/tfsearch.html in the same sequences and report here those sites predicted by both programs. within the rps4y <dig> sequence, three potential sites for different ets factors were detected, one of which had been previously reported  <cit> . additionally, two potential binding sites for the gata-binding protein family and one for each of the following transcription factors were found: c/ebpb, ik- <dig> and aml-1a. rps4y <dig> presents dna sequence motifs potentially recognised by the following factors: ap- <dig>  sox <dig>  mzf- <dig>  v-myb and aml-1a.

3d structure prediction of rps4x, rps4y <dig> and rps4y2
sequence analysis
there is high amino acid identity between the three human proteins, denoting their common origin . as expected, the two y-coded proteins are more similar  since rps4y <dig> arose more recently through gene duplication from rps4y <dig>  <cit> .

additional file  <dig> shows an alignment of the amino acid sequence of the three human rps <dig> proteins. only one position shows different amino acids in the three sequences, position  <dig>  that is an asp in rps4x, an asn in rps4y <dig> and a ser in rps4y <dig>  this substitution changes a negatively charged amino acid in rps4x to a polar amino acid, with different chemical properties, in the two rps4y proteins. other non-conservative differences, between rps4x and one or both of the y-linked sequences, are listed in table  <dig>  a blast alignment of the eukaryotic rps <dig> family  shows several conserved positions, notably: his <dig> is absolutely conserved; the residue at position  <dig> is always an aromatic amino acid; the residues at positions  <dig> and  <dig> are always negatively and positively charged amino acids, respectively. the amino acid positions that are more highly conserved across the rps <dig> family are clustered in the n-terminal domain, suggesting that this domain is involved in an important function, probably interacting with the ribosome.

comparative modelling of rps4x, rps4y <dig> and rps4y2
the fold recognition program fugue  <cit>  identified the ribosomal protein s4e  as an appropriate template for nearly the full length of the rps <dig> proteins; the ribosomal protein s <dig> delta  <dig>  was identified as a suitable template for the n-terminal domain of the rps <dig> proteins and the 50s ribosomal protein l24p  for the c-terminal domain. comparative models of the full length of rps4x, rps4y <dig> and rps4y <dig> were obtained based on the three templates. the protein sequence used to build the rps4y <dig> model corresponds to isoform rps4y1- <dig> 

location of residues that differ between the three rps <dig> proteins
several non-conservative amino acid substitutions can be observed in the rps <dig> y-coded proteins, as compared to the highly conserved rps4x, which are distributed throughout the three structural domains of the proteins . figure 4b shows the location, on the predicted rps4x structure, of the only residue that is different in all three proteins , as well as those presenting non-conservative substitutions in one or both of the rps4y proteins .

it can be seen that rps4x residue thr <dig> is located in the interface between two domains  and shows strong inter-domain interactions . the presence of a different amino acid at position  <dig> in the y chromosome proteins contributes to a modification of the relative position of the two domains, compared to rps4x.

at position  <dig>  an interesting difference can be observed between rps4y <dig> and the other two rps <dig> proteins. a hydrogen bond is formed between s4y <dig> ser <dig>  in the central domain, and asn <dig>  in the c-terminal domain, which is not present in either s4x or s4y <dig>  therefore, the presence of different amino acids at position  <dig> can affect the relative position of these domains.

no intra-molecular interactions are seen for the other residues shown in figure 4b. the residues at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are all charged or polar in rps4x. interestingly rps4x residues glu <dig> and thr <dig> are replaced by hydrophobic amino acids in the y-coded proteins . if exposed to the solvent in the assembled ribosome, the new hydrophobic residues are good candidates for interactions with other proteins. similarly, rps4x residues asp <dig> and arg <dig>  which are charged aminoacids, are replaced by polar residues in rps4y <dig> 

discussion
we sought to characterize the expression patterns of several x-y gene pairs in a panel of human somatic tissues and testis in order to evaluate the contribution of sex-linked isoforms to the transcriptome of the male germline. considering testis-specific expression as a strong indication of a function in spermatogenesis, we then focused on a particularly interesting gene family, ribosomal protein s <dig>  presenting five protein coding isoforms with diverse expression patterns, rps4y <dig> being only expressed in testis and prostate. interestingly, the quantification of transcripts in testis biopsies strongly suggests that rps4y <dig> is more highly expressed during spermatogenesis, although this trend should be confirmed in a larger cohort of patients.

ribosomes are the site of mrna translation and protein synthesis and comprise an assembly of a few rrna molecules and a large number of proteins. although the major biochemical steps in protein synthesis are carried out by the rrna, ribosomal proteins  are crucial for efficient translation and for ribosome assembly. however, the precise role of each protein within the ribosome is not clearly defined, since there is a great synergy between rrna and rps in the different steps of translation.

the global structure of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosome is similar, consisting of two distinct subunits, small and large: 30s and 50s in the prokaryotic ribosome; 40s and 60s in the eukaryotic counterpart. the corresponding subunits in these two cell lineages differ in the size of the rrna molecules and in the number and type of ribosomal proteins they incorporate. in fact, although there is high conservation of ribosomal proteins, both at the sequence and structural level, within each domain of life , some rps are restricted to one evolutionary lineage  <cit> . for example, the eukaryotic homologue of s <dig> is s <dig>  while s4e is only found in archaeal and eukaryotic ribosomes  <cit> .

we have built comparative models of the structures of rps4x, rps4y <dig> and rps4y <dig> in order to evaluate the impact of the differences observed at the sequence level. overall the three proteins show very similar structures, which is suggestive that all may be functional. there are however a few noteworthy differences. due to the presence of a different amino acid at position  <dig>  the y chromosome proteins show differences in the relative position of the central and n-terminal domains, compared to rps4x. this, in turn, may produce slightly different interactions with the ribosome, or with neighboring proteins within the small subunit.

additionally, in rps4y <dig> the presence of a hydrogen bond between ser <dig> and asn  <dig> creates a new interaction between the central and the c-terminal domains, which determines their relative position. due to its high conservation, the n-terminal domain of eukaryotic s <dig> proteins is most likely involved in the interaction with the ribosome, in which case the c-terminal domain will be more exposed, at the ribosome surface. the differences at the c-terminus of rps4y <dig> may therefore reflect the interaction with different ribosomal proteins or extra-ribosomal factors, as compared to rps4x and rps4y <dig> 

high resolution crystal structures of the small and large subunits of the eubacterial ribosome and the low-resolution structure of the archaeal large subunit have been determined, as well as that of several of the proteins bound to the ribosome  <cit> . recently, the atomic model of yeast 80s ribosome has been built, through cryo-em and rna and protein homology modelling  <cit> . unfortunately, eukaryotic s <dig> was not included in this model and therefore we could not dock our models of the human rps <dig> proteins to a 60s ribosomal subunit. it will be interesting in the future to test whether the three proteins present similar interactions with rna and neighbouring proteins or interacting factors, in the small subunit.

the ribosomal small subunit controls mrna binding and ensures translation accuracy in the decoding process  <cit> . mammalian ribosomal protein s <dig> is located at the interface between the small and the large subunits of mammalian ribosomes and is in contact with the initiation factor eif- <dig>  <cit> . therefore rps <dig> is most likely involved in the initiation of translation.

human rps4y is able to rescue a temperature-sensitive hamster s <dig> mutant cell line  <cit> . zinn et al.  <cit>  confirmed the presence of both human s <dig> proteins in male placental ribosomes using isoform-specific antisera and found that the s4y protein was only 15% as abundant as s4x. we quantified the expression levels of each rps <dig> isoform in testis and found that rps4y transcripts are also less abundant than their x-linked counterparts in this tissue. rps4y <dig> is the least abundant of all the transcripts tested. according to these results only a minor fraction of the ribosomes incorporate the y-coded isoform of rps <dig> and, in testis, an even smaller subset may include rps4y <dig>  it would be important to test the presence of rps4y <dig> in human ribosomes; however, due to the high homology between the two proteins encoded by the y chromosome  it is virtually impossible to design an antibody which specifically detects rps4y <dig> 

from our analysis, one of the rps4y <dig> transcripts  is apparently a more faithful homologue of rps4x, since it presents a wider breadth of expression than rps4y1- <dig>  in spite of initial association of rps <dig> haploinsufficiency and turner syndrome  <cit> , the finding that x chromosome monosomy leads to a similar phenotype even in animal species that do not have an rps <dig> homologue on the y chromosome, where rps4x might therefore be subject to inactivation, has raised some uncertainties about its role in this respect  <cit> . in fact, in humans the global dosage of rps <dig> does not seem to be crucial, since in males the ubiquitous rps4y protein is produced at much lower levels than its x homologue, while in females rps4x escapes inactivation and therefore is present in double dosage.

in the testis, even in the presence of a second y-linked copy, the scenario is not expected to change drastically in terms of overall gene dosage, due to the extremely low expression levels of rps4y <dig>  histologically testis is a very heterogeneous organ and in the seminiferous tubules cells of the germline, in different states of differentiation, coexist with somatic cells . the fact that rps4y <dig> mrna levels are higher in the testis biopsies where germ cells are present suggests that this gene is either transcribed in both cell types  or it may only be expressed in somatic cells, but at a higher rate during spermatogenesis. its location within the azoospermia region azfb on the y chromosome makes it a good candidate for male infertility.

most ribosomal proteins are constitutively expressed in several tissues. to understand the restricted expression of rps4y <dig> we have inspected the 5'-flanking region of the gene for any features that could distinguish this sequence from the promoter region of rps4y <dig>  its most closely related paralogue. interestingly, the polypirimidine tract that characterises the promoters of the ubiquitously expressed ribosomal proteins, including that of rps4y <dig>  is disrupted in rps4y <dig>  this difference may explain the loss of constitutive expression. to determine the additional features of the y <dig> promoter that led to the acquisition of prostate and testis-specific expression, it will be necessary to perform functional experiments. in this context, the presence of a potential binding site for the transcription factor ap- <dig> within the proximal 5'-flanking sequence of rps4y <dig> is noteworthy. transcription factors of the activator protein  <dig>  class are expressed in the rodent testis in a developmental-stage dependent manner and different lines of evidence suggest multiples roles of these proteins during normal spermatogenesis  <cit> . it is also possible that other yet uncharacterized enhancer/insulator elements in the genomic sequence in yq <dig> , farther upstream the rps4y <dig> promoter, are capable of regulating the expression of this gene in testis and prostate.

recently, mutations in several ribosomal proteins have been linked to genetic diseases, many of which interfere with ribosome biogenesis . it is also known that defects in ribosome synthesis elicit cell cycle arrest and apoptosis  <cit> . therefore, it is plausible that deficits in specific ribosomal proteins may have some bearing on infertility or subfertility phenotypes, to which the particular contribution of rps4y <dig> should be further explored.

CONCLUSIONS
although most ribosomal proteins are ubiquitous, one of the members of the rps <dig> family has restricted expression in testis and prostate. the three dimensional models of the human s <dig> proteins revealed a conserved structure, suggesting that all are involved in rna processing in the ribosome. nevertheless rps4y <dig> shows different inter-domain contacts and the potential to establish specific interactions. moreover rps4y <dig> has acquired an exclusive expression pattern that suggests that it may have a role in germ cell development and its location within the azfb region makes it a good candidate for male infertility.
