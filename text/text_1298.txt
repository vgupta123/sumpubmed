BACKGROUND
bacterial vaginosis  is worldwide the most important perturbation of the normal vaginal condition in women  <cit> . bv affects pregnant women or women in reproductive age leading to high public health costs and associated complications, such as pelvic inflammatory disease, preterm birth, postoperative infections and an increased risk of acquisition and transmission of sexually transmitted diseases, such as human immunodeficiency virus  and human papillomavirus   <cit> . several studies have associated this condition with an imbalance in the vaginal microflora although bv etiology is still unclear  <cit> . bv has been described as a complex interaction of multiple factors related with several components of the vaginal microbial ecosystem and their human host, although many of these factors remain uncharacterized  <cit> . when bv is established, a decrease in the beneficial bacteria number, specifically lactobacillus spp., and an increase in the numbers of anaerobic bacteria, such as gardnerella vaginalis, atopobium vaginae and mobiluncus spp., are observed in the vaginal epithelium  <cit> . the disruption of the normal microflora and overgrowth by anaerobes are responsible for the bv signs and symptoms, namely the increase in vaginal ph , the formation of vaginal biofilms on vaginal epithelia, observable as clue cells  <cit> , fishy odor and milky vaginal discharge in the absence of an inflammatory response  <cit> . although bv is often considered a polymicrobial condition, the predominant bacterial species identified is g. vaginalis <cit> . in  <dig>  swidsinski and colleagues characterized clinical vaginal swabs and found that a multispecies biofilm was formed, which was mainly composed of g. vaginalis and atopobium vaginae. they hypothesized that g. vaginalis is the initial colonizing species and that its adherence is required before other bv-associated anaerobes are able to interact with the vaginal epithelium  <cit> . due to g. vaginalis resistance against lactobacillus spp. antimicrobial products, such as hydrogen peroxide and lactic acid  <cit> , biofilm forming g. vaginalis might compete in initial adhesion against lactobacillus spp. and may enable other anaerobes to incorporate and grow inside the biofilm  <cit> . therefore, the development of an optimized and rapid diagnostic tool that allows the simultaneous visualization of g. vaginalis increase and lactobacillus species reduction in vaginal samples could be of great use for further study of the previous hypothesis and as a diagnostic tool.

fluorescence in situ hybridization  is a molecular method used to identify and quantify microorganisms in a wide range of samples. this technique combines the simplicity of microscopic observation and the specificity of dna/rrna hybridization, allowing detection of selected bacterial species and morphologic visualization  <cit> . nowadays, peptide nucleic acid  probes are used instead of natural nucleic acids to improve fish efficiency  <cit> , because they enable more rapid and more specific hybridization  <cit> . the main goal of our work was to evaluate the pna-fish performance on mixed samples using a multiplex approach to detect lactobacillus spp. and g. vaginalis. to validate the pna probes, we determined, both in silico and in vitro, their specificity and sensitivity, using a broad diversity of representative lactobacillus and gardnerella strains, as well as other taxonomically related or pathogenic bacterial strains commonly found in vaginal samples. to confirm the usefulness of our methodology, the efficiency and specificity of the probes was also tested at different concentrations of lactobacillus and g. vaginalis strains in the presence of a monolayer of hela cells.

methods
culture of bacterial strains
the bacterial strains used in this study are listed in table  <dig>  all strains from lactobacillus spp. were grown in man, rogosa and sharpe agar , excepting l. iners that was grown in brucella blood agar  as well as atopobium vaginae and gardnerella vaginalis. the remaining bacterial species were cultured on brain heart infusion agar  or trypticase soy agar . each bacterial culture was streaked onto fresh plates every 48– <dig> h. plates were incubated at 37°c or 30°c  under anaerobic conditions  for 24– <dig> h prior to fish experiments.

the pna probe  efficiencies were tested in triplicate experiments for each strain, with the following hybridization pna fish qualitative evaluation:  absence of hybridization;  moderate hybridization;  good hybridization;  optimal hybridization. the table shows the median value from the three experiments for each strain.

pna probe design
to identify gardnerella genus potential oligonucleotides-target for the probe design, we used the software primrose  <cit> , coupled with the 16s rrna databases from the ribosomal database project ii   <cit> . complementarity with a low number of non-target and a high number of target sequences, as well as a higher predicted melting temperature and the absence of self-complementary sequences, were the main criteria for the pna probe design. the selected sequences were synthesized  and the oligonucleotides n terminus was attached to an alexa fluor  <dig> molecule via a double 8-amino- <dig> -dioxaoctanoic acid  linker . the gard <dig> probe hybridizes between positions  <dig> and  <dig> of the g. vaginalis strain 409– <dig> 16s rrna sequence  and was selected for probe design. for the detection of lactobacillus spp. a previously developed probe  <cit> , lac <dig> was selected. this probe was attached to an alexa fluor  <dig> molecule, also via an aeea linker .

in silico determination of sensitivity and specificity
theoretical specificity and sensitivity were calculated according to almeida et al. <cit> . briefly, the theoretical specificity and sensitivity of both probes were evaluated using updated databases available at the ribosomal database project ii  through the primrose software, and then were confirmed by a blast search at the national centre for biotechnology information . only target sequences with at least  <dig> base pairs and good quality were included. briefly, theoretical sensitivity was calculated as ts/× <dig>  where ts stands for the number of target strains detected by the probe and tts for the total number of target strains present in the rdp ii database . theoretical specificity was calculated as nts/× <dig>  where nts stands for the number of non-target strains that did not react with the probe and tnt for the total of non-target strains examined.

fish hybridization procedure
biomass from a single colony of each strain was diluted and homogenised in sterile water, and then  <dig> μl were spread on epoxy coated microscope glass slides . for mixed samples ,  <dig> μl of the final suspension from each strain suspension  for the selected mixed sample were spread on glass slides. the slides were air-dried prior to fixation. next, the smears were immersed in 4%  paraformaldehyde  followed by 50%  ethanol  for  <dig> min at room temperature on each solution. after the fixation step, the samples were covered with  <dig> μl of hybridization solution containing 10%  dextran sulphate ,  <dig> mm nacl , 30%  formamide ,  <dig> %  sodium pyrophosphate ,  <dig> %  polyvinylpyrrolidone ,  <dig> %  ficoll ,  <dig> mm disodium edta ,  <dig> %  triton x- <dig> ,  <dig> mm tris-hcl  and  <dig> nm of the pna probe. subsequently, the samples on glass slides were covered with coverslips and incubated in moist chambers at the hybridization temperature under analysis  during a range of hybridization times . next, the coverslips were removed and a washing step was performed by immersing the slides in a pre-warmed washing solution for  <dig> min at the same temperature of the hybridization step. this solution consisted of  <dig> mm tris-base ,  <dig> mm nacl  and  <dig> %  triton x- <dig> . finally, the glass slides were allowed to air dry.

the pna probe  efficiencies were tested in triplicate experiments for each strain, with the following hybridization pna fish qualitative evaluation:  absence of hybridization;  poor hybridization;  good hybridization;  optimal hybridization. median values from the three experiments for each strain are shown in the table.

a fish procedure in suspension was developed and optimized according to the previous work of almeida and colleagues  <cit>  and to the results obtained for the fish procedure on glass slides described above. hybridization was performed at 60°c for  <dig> min and for washing  and a fresh solution was prepared less than  <dig> h before use. the suspension samples were stored at 4°c in the dark for a maximum of  <dig> h before microscopic observation/visualization. both hybridization procedures  are able to detect lactobacilli and g. vaginalis strains. while glass slide hybridization is the more commonly used technique in analytical laboratories  <cit> , hybridization in suspension is frequently used to avoid autofluorescence background in complex matrix samples, besides being the hybridization technique used in flow cytometry  <cit> .

microscopic visualization
prior to microscopy, one drop of non-fluorescent immersion oil  was added to either slides or filters and covered with coverslips. microscopic visualization was performed using an olympus bx <dig>  epifluorescence microscope equipped with a ccd camera  and filters capable of detecting the two pna probes .

other filters  present in the microscope, that are not capable of detecting the probe fluorescent signal were used to confirm the absence of autofluorescence. in each experimental assay, a negative control was performed simultaneously in which all the steps described above were carried out, but where no probe was added in the hybridization step. all images were acquired using olympus cellb software using a total magnification of ×  <dig> 

experimental assessment of probe specificity and sensitivity
after the hybridization optimization, the specificity and sensitivity of the pna lac <dig> and gard <dig> probes were tested using  <dig> representative strains from the genus lactobacillus,  <dig> representative strains from gardnerella vaginalis  and  <dig> representative strains from other related genera , of which  <dig> belonged to the order lactobacillales and the other are common pathogens usually found in clinical samples, specifically strains from the following genera: atopobium, bacillus, lactococcus, enterobacter, enterococcus, escherichia, fusobacterium, klebsiella, leuconostoc, listeria, mobiluncus, prevotella, salmonella, shigella, staphylococcus and streptococcus <cit> . all experiments were performed in triplicate at identical conditions and the experimental specificity and sensitivity were calculated.

detection of lactobacillus spp. and g. vaginalis adhered to hela cell line
the application of cellular lines is a standard procedure that has already been used to mimic vaginal epithelium at several in vitro studies  <cit> . so, hela epithelial cells  were cultured at 37°c, in 5% co <dig> , in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium  supplemented with 10% fbs  and  <dig> iu penicillin/streptomycin ml− <dig> . aliquots of 1ml from hela epithelial cells were seeded into 24-well tissue culture plates  containing glass slides  at a density of 2×105cells per well, and incubated at 37°c and 5% co <dig>  until the formation of a cell monolayer. the cultures were fed with fresh media every  <dig> hours. simultaneously, several lactobacillus  strains and g. vaginalis strain 5– <dig> were grown in mrs broth and bhi broth as described above. prior to the adhesion assay, these broth cultures were harvested by centrifugation  and washed twice with sterile phosphate buffer saline . several standard concentrations of the bacteria were prepared in eukaryotic cell media  and the optical density at  <dig> nm was adjusted using a microplate reader . when a hela cell monolayer was obtained, the cells were washed twice with  <dig> μl of sterile pbs to remove non adhered cells and culture media. next, aliquots of  <dig> μl of cell culture media with a known concentration of a lactobacillus strain and g. vaginalis 5– <dig> strain  were added to each well with the washed cell monolayer from the 24-well tissue culture plate. then the 24-well tissue culture plate was incubated for  <dig> min at 37°c in anaerobic conditions and  <dig> rpm. finally, each well of the incubated plate was carefully washed twice with  <dig> μl of sterile pbs to remove non-adherent bacteria. the glass slides containing the adhered bacteria and eukaryotic cells were fixed and hybridized with both pna probes and observed in fluorescence microscopy, as referred above. an additional 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole  staining step was done at the end of the hybridization procedure, covering each of the glass slides with  <dig> μl of dapi for  <dig> min at room temperature in the dark, followed by immediate observation in the fluorescence microscope. all these assays were repeated three times, on separate days, with three fields of view assessed each time.

the pna probe  efficiencies were tested in each sample with the following hybridization pna fish qualitative evaluation:  moderate hybridization;  good hybridization;  optimal hybridization. the table shows the median value from the three experiments for each sample.

RESULTS
in silico analysis of pna probes
the lac <dig> probe showed a theoretical sensitivity and specificity of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, which corroborates the previously reported values  <cit> . actually, this publication shows that these probes match the best values of the existing lactobacillus probes. gard <dig> probe presented a theoretical sensitivity of  <dig> % and specificity of 100%. the theoretical specificity and sensitivity of these two probes and those developed in other studies were calculated as previously described by almeida et al. <cit>  and are listed in table  <dig>  probematch tool, from rpdii , was used with the following data set options: strain – both; source – both; size – >  <dig> bp; quality – both. for lactobacillus probes, the specificity and sensitivity values previously determined  <cit> , were considered.

fish protocol optimization and autofluorescence-related factors
fish protocols on slides and in suspension were adapted from previous protocols developed by almeida et al.  <cit> , due to the crucial importance of fixation and hybridization conditions for an efficient multiplex fish with different probes. from an initial temperature range of  <dig> to 72°c and an incubation time range between  <dig> and  <dig> min, the best hybridization conditions were set as a moist chamber temperature of 60°c during  <dig> min of incubation . hybridization conditions started to reveal strong signal-to-noise ratio at 59°c to 61°c from  <dig> min of incubation up to  <dig> min, reaching its peak at 60°c during  <dig> min of incubation. hybridization conditions above 60°c and  <dig> min were also efficient, but the signal-to-noise ratio appeared to decrease beyond the selected values of time and temperature. both hybridization protocols  revealed the same results and pitfalls, as discussed below .

experimental determination of probe specificity and sensitivity
as shown in table  <dig>  the lac <dig> probe was able to detect all lactobacillus strains and cross hybridization was found only for streptococcus thermophilus b, as it was previously reported  <cit> . based on these results, an experimental sensitivity of 100%  and specificity of  <dig> %  were obtained for the lac <dig> pna probe. the gard <dig> probe hybridized with all g. vaginalis strains, whereas no hybridization was observed for the other species tested. therefore, this probe revealed a sensitivity of 100%  and a specificity of 100% .

detection of lactobacillus spp. and g. vaginalis by multiplex fish
once the hybridization procedure was fully optimized, the multiplex methodology was also tested against mixed bacterial cultures  and infected tissue cell line . lac <dig> and gard <dig> probes selectively bound to lactobacillus and g. vaginalis strains, respectively. the fluorescence signal was easily observable  and no cross hybridization with other species was detected . additionally, the multiplex also performed well in the presence of hela cells  for all the bacterial concentrations evaluated , confirming the in silico analysis of the pna probes previously elaborated.

discussion
in silico and in vitro probe specificity and sensibility
fluorescence microscopy has become a widely used technique for direct detection of bacteria in complex samples. in fact, many authors demonstrated the efficiency of fish methodology for the analysis of lactobacilli and g. vaginalis <cit> . however, the herein described multiplex approach may be the simpler to perform and still has high specificity for lactobacilli and g. vaginalis detection.

as shown in table  <dig>  the lac <dig> and gard <dig> probes bound highly specific to each target strain. only lac <dig> showed cross-hybridization with s. thermophilus b. however, s. thermophilus coccus morphology allows a clear differentiation from lactobacillus spp., which has a rod-shaped morphology . importantly, the lac <dig> probe did not hybridize with several bacterial species from the bacilli class and also with other common vaginal pathogenic bacteria, providing further evidence of its usefulness for lactobacillus spp. detection in clinical samples.

furthermore, the gard <dig> probe showed hybridization with all g. vaginalis strains and no cross-hybridization was observed to other species, including other related pathogenic bacteria which may be present in the vaginal microflora, such as a. vaginae, p. bivia, m. mulieris and f. nucleatum . it is worth to mention that in silico analysis of the gard <dig> probe only identified one non-target strain as match, more precisely bifidobacterium indicum hm <dig> . however, b. indicum is not a common bacterium from vaginal microflora, as it is usually present in the gut  <cit> . recently a strong association between the bacterial loads in the vagina and rectum of pregnant women was described  <cit> . although some gut bacteria such as escherichia coli <cit>  have been associated with vaginal infections, b. indicum has not been described as a pathogenic bacterium  <cit> . the fish efficiency and hybridization quality for the gard <dig> probe, either alone or together with the lac <dig> probe, confirmed the applicability of these two probes together in a multiplex pna-fish .

as shown in table  <dig>  sensitivity and specificity equations allowed the comparison between our pna probes and other published ones for g. vaginalis detection. for the lactobacillus probe, this comparison had already been performed  <cit>  and the lac <dig> theoretical performance was found to be similar to other probes reported for lactobacillus genus detection, but with a highest specificity. also, lab <dig>  lgc <dig> and pna burton et al.  <cit>  probes were found to cross-hybridize with one strain  from g. vaginalis, which might be incompatible with a multiplex approach to be used in vaginal samples. on the other hand, it is possible that this g. vaginalis strain was a misidentified l. iners strain, because confusion between both species has been reported  <cit> .

gard <dig> theoretical performance in specificity  was found to be similar to other probes for g. vaginalis detection that have been previously reported . g.vag <dig> is the only probe with higher sensitivity  than our probe, being able to detect one more g. vaginalis strain. this higher sensitivity is due to the presence of a degenerate oligonucleotide in the sequence of the probe , allowing g.vag <dig> to act as two different sequence probes. however, g.vag <dig> has  <dig> oligonucleotides  and it is a dna probe, which penetrates the cell wall less efficiently  <cit>  and implies need for the use of long hybridization periods.

gardv probe detected species from several bacterial genera present in vaginal samples, such as alloscardovia, parascardovia and scardovia spp.  <cit> . g.vag <dig> probe hybridized with aeriscardovia spp. that may also be found in vaginal samples  <cit>  and therefore this represents an important pitfall for the g. vaginalis detection with such probes.

it is important to notice that our gard <dig> probe is the first pna probe specifically designed for g. vaginalis detection. other pna probes for the detection of lactobacilli  <cit>  revealed several disadvantages when compared to lac <dig> probe, as we shown before  <cit> .

multiplex fish detection
although numerous authors attempted to correlate differences between healthy and bv vaginal samples  <cit> , no consensus was achieved, except that biofilm formation of g. vaginalis and a decrease in lactobacilli number could be considered as the initial stages in the pathogenesis of bv  <cit> . swidsinski and colleagues already conducted an international follow-up study in which vaginal samples from several bv patients were analyzed by dna-based fish and a dense as well as active bacterial biofilm on vaginal mucosa was detected, primarily consisting of g. vaginalis <cit> . therefore, multiplex fish to analyze g. vaginalis biofilm establishment and subsequently lactobacilli replacement appeared to be a useful molecular methodology for bv diagnosis in vaginal samples. although several authors already developed specific probes for g. vaginalis and lactobacillus spp. detection for fish, our multiplex method presented new improvements on the method .

due to the difficulty to obtain fresh vaginal samples diagnosed with bv, we devised an in vitro experiment mimicking the shift from healthy vaginal flora to bv hela cells were incubated with different concentrations of g. vaginalis and lactobacillus strains , ranging from normal to bv vaginal microflora contents . the hela cell line is an established tool in experimental research with lactobacilli. it has not only been used to study attachment of several lactobacillus species, but also of other pathogens  <cit> . the lactobacillus strains used here were selected because high concentrations of l. crispatus  are usually associated to the normal vaginal microflora while high concentrations of l. iners  are commonly associated to the microflora of bv diagnosed women  <cit> . the efficiency of our multiplex pna-fish methodology was demonstrated by ability of the pna probes to hybridize in a large range of lactobacillus spp. and g. vaginalis concentrations, even in the presence of epithelial cells . swidsinski and colleagues  <cit>  used a multiplex fish methodology to study bv biofilms. a drawback of their approach is that it requires pre-treatment with lysozyme before fixation and the use of urine or paraffin-embedded samples, in opposition of our methodology that do not require a pre-treatment for fish analysis. these experimental steps increase analysis time and decrease fish efficiency for lactobacillus spp. and g. vaginalis strains detection, due to the lower number of cells available for hybridization. another dna hybridization test for vaginal infection was studied by witt and colleagues that evaluated the affirm vpiii kit  <cit> , which detected g. vaginalis, candida spp. and trichomonas vaginalis in clinical samples, using two distinct single-stranded nucleic acid probes for each organism, which makes the analysis more complex and vulnerable to experimental pitfalls. this validated method showed sensitivity and specificity values for g. vaginalis of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, both lower than our gard <dig> experimental values . furthermore, fredricks and colleagues developed a fish methodology for molecular identification of unknown bacteria associated with bv  <cit> , using dna probes eub338-cy <dig> and g.vag198-cy <dig>  however, the eub <dig> is an unspecific probe used to detect lactobacillus spp., detecting all species of the order bacillales, and g.vag <dig> corresponds to a twenty five oligonucleotide probe with high specificity  but with low sensitivity  when compared to our probe . both these probes worked together at a hybridization temperature of 45°c, which may easily lead to the occurrence of false positive results. moreover, previous studies have shown that probes with cy fluorochromes present a lower fluorescence signal than those with the corresponding alexa fluor  <cit> .

to conclude, our main purpose was achieved by demonstrating the in vitro applicability of the pna multiplex methodology for detection of lactobacillus species and g. vaginalis in the presence of the hela epithelial cell line and other taxonomically related or pathogenic bacterial strains commonly found in vaginal samples. these in vitro results confirmed the previous in silico analysis from lac <dig> and gard <dig> probes.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the use of the pna multiplex fish assay described here significantly increases the specificity and sensitivity of the detection of lactobacillus spp. and g. vaginalis strains in mixed samples and no interference was observed in the presence of human epithelial cells. as previously referred, there are no consensual agreements regarding bv markers, except for lactobacilli number decrease and initial adherence, and consequent biofilm formation from g. vaginalis. moreover, our approach allows a fast identification  of the main bacteria involved in bv establishment. further studies are necessary to detect bv biofilm formation in clinical samples and to characterize possible interactions with other unknown bacteria in the biofilm. the combination of our pna-fish methodology with eub probe or other methodologies, such as electron microscopy, may help to better understand bv etiology.
