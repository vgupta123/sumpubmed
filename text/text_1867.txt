BACKGROUND
lactococcal phages present one of the most significant challenges to modern dairy fermentations. these phages are classified into ten genetically and morphologically distinct groups, of which members of the so-called  <dig> and p <dig> groups represent the most commonly encountered and problematic phages in the dairy industry  <cit> . the initial interaction between a lactococcal phage and its host is dictated by two factors:  the host-encoded target receptor molecule, which may be a carbohydrate, protein and/or teichoic acid component of the cell envelope, and  the phage-encoded receptor binding proteins . the genetic determinant of the primary host receptor for  <dig> phages was discovered over a decade ago  <cit>  and this prompted further studies of host recognition and attachment by various other lactococcal phages . based on these studies, the primary receptor for p <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and p <dig> group phages is known to be saccharidic in nature and the variable genetic locus that is responsible for the biosynthesis of this glycan receptor or so-called cell wall polysaccharide  has been identified and partially characterized in a number of strains. comparative genome analysis of the variable cwps-specifying dna regions of six lactococcal strains permitted the identification of three cwps-associated genotypes classified as a, b and c, and with further cwps types predicted  <cit> . this study also revealed a direct correlation between  <dig> phage rbp genotypes on the one hand and the host-determined cwps genotype on the other, with  <dig> phages displaying an apparent preference for strains that correspond to the b- and c-type cwps.

p <dig> phages are a similarly frequently occurring group of phages in the dairy industry. during the past decade significant scientific attention has been directed towards the molecular and structural analysis of the p <dig> phages tuc <dig> and tp901- <dig>  resulting in these phages becoming a model system for analysis of the genetic and structural characteristics of phages infecting gram-positive bacteria . gene order and associated functions of lactococcal phages appears to correspond to those of coliphage lambda, a model comparator, a presumption that was proven to be justified based on functional analysis of tp901- <dig>  <cit> . recently, two p <dig> phages, named q <dig> and bm <dig>  isolated in north america, were shown to be genetically distinct to previously sequenced isolates  <cit> . consequently, comparative genomic analysis combined with morphological analysis was employed to classify the heterogenous p <dig> phages, resulting in the identification of four distinct sub-groups, designated i – iv, based on distinct genetic lineages and morphological features. the latter features relate specifically to their distal tail regions as follows: sub-group i consists of just a single representative phage, bk5-t, and is typified as possessing a long fibre at the tip of its tail; sub-group ii phages, representatives of which include tuc <dig>  tp901- <dig>  p <dig> and ul <dig>  are endowed with a double-disc baseplate; while sub-groups iii and iv represent genetically distinct phages that exhibit a small “stubby” distal tail structure.

structural analysis of baseplates of  <dig> and p <dig> phages revealed a calcium-binding loop in the distal tail protein  of  <dig> phages that was absent in the p <dig> phages analysed at that time  <cit> , prompting the speculation that this represents the domain required for ca2+-binding in  <dig> phages. many lactococcal phages have since been shown to be able to form plaques without the need for calcium, although its presence is beneficial to lysis timing and plaque size  <cit> . the necessity of calcium for lactococcal phage infection was the basis on which the dairy industry developed phage inhibitory medium , which was designed to limit phage proliferation by calcium limitation  <cit> . despite the application of this medium, phages continue to cause considerable problems in dairy fermentations. current knowledge on the variable requirement of lactococcal phages for calcium-dependent plaque formation explains the ineffectiveness of pim in eradicating the phage problem  <cit> .

the scientific goal of the current study was to assess the genetic diversity of p <dig> phages and their requirement for calcium in plaque formation, while also to functionally assign the rbp-encoding genes of p <dig> phages beyond the well-studied sub-group ii phages, so as to provide unequivocal functional data for various members of this industrially important group of phages. this study is instrumental in generating a critical mass of information related to the diversity among host-recognition devices employed by gram+ host-infecting phages.

RESULTS
genomic and morphological analysis of the p <dig> phage isolates
in this study, it was aimed to ascertain the genetic link to the morphological characteristics of p <dig> phages, in particular focusing on the tail tip region which is involved in interactions with the host. while overall nucleotide or proteomic content was widely applied to the classification of phages previously , morphological analysis combined with sequence relatedness of the genomic region encoding the so-called adhesion device was employed as the basis for the classification of these genetically and morphologically diverse phages in this study. table  <dig> outlines the characteristics of the  <dig> newly sequenced phages. markov clustering-based  alignment analysis of deduced proteomes of all currently sequenced and publicly available p <dig> phage genomes  resulted in a grouping of the phages in a manner that is consistent with the previously devised system in which four sub-groups were identified , based on overall genetic relatedness and the morphology of the tail tip region based on the complete sequence of the ten p <dig> genomes that were available at the time   <cit> . furthermore, morphological analysis of the newly selected isolates also indicates that the gross morphology of the groups  is also maintained . phages  <dig> and c <dig> possess a bk5-t-like rbp, and em images of  <dig> highlight the presence of a long tail fibre protruding through the tail tip similar  to that exhibited by bk5-t . therefore, based on morphological similarity and sequence homologies in the region representing the adhesion module,  <dig> and c <dig> are assigned to sub-group i phages henceforth. similarly, morphological analysis of phages  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  revealed the presence of baseplate appendages similar to those of tuc <dig> and tp901- <dig>  and were thus considered to represent members of sub-group ii phages . finally, phage  <dig> displays the typical small “stubby” tail tip and shorter tail that is characteristic of the sub-group iii and iv phages , while comparative genomic analysis revealed sequence homology to sub-group iv members based on overall proteomic content . since dub35a is highly identical to lc <dig> in the genomic region encoding the structural components, it would be expected to appear identical to this classical sub-group iii phage. in summary, based on morphological characteristics and sequence homology within the adhesion module the lactococcal p <dig> phage sub-group i is now constituted by bk5-t,  <dig>   <dig> and c41431; sub-group ii is constituted by tuc <dig>  tp901- <dig>  ul <dig>  p <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 49801; sub-group iii is comprised of r1t, lc <dig> and dub35a; and sub-group iv is comprised of q <dig>  bm <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . a comparative analysis of the predicted protein-encoding regions of representatives of each of the four sub-groups of p <dig> phages is presented in fig.  <dig> table  <dig> characteristics of the genomes of the sequenced p <dig> phage isolates

adhesion module analysis
to assess the phage-derived genetic link to phage-host interactions, the adhesion modules  harbored by the newly isolated phages were analysed. interestingly, while the grouping of p <dig> phages based on overall genetic/proteomic similarity was upheld in this study, the region specifying the rbp/baseplate does not necessarily follow the same genotype grouping scheme, presumably through modular rearrangement and gene acquisition to extend or alter the host range of a given phage. therefore, a detailed comparative analysis of the baseplate and/or rbp-encoding region of all sequenced p <dig> phages was undertaken , while in-depth analysis of the overall adhesion modules aided in the construction of a structural model for each of the p <dig> phage sub-groups i, ii and iii/iv . a detailed explanation is further provided below, dissecting the four p <dig> sub-groups, while table  <dig> presents a summary of the identified features of the adhesion modules of the sequenced phages.fig.  <dig> host range of members of the lactococcal p <dig> phage group  with sensitive strains highlighted with a grey box. a panel of  <dig> strains were employed in the host range analysis and only strains that were susceptible to infection by at least one phage within the collection are presented in panel a. phages isolated as part of this study are highlighted with an asterisk. the preference of the p <dig> phages for cwps type a, b or c strains is presented in panel b colour-coded to match the sub-groups of phage rbps in the unrooted phylogenetic tree of the predicted rbps of p <dig> phages as follows: yellow: phage rbps with homology to that of the sub-group i phage bk5-t; green: classical sub-group ii phages with homology to the namesake phage p335; green-blue: phage rbps with similarity to the non-classical large rbp sub-group ii phages; red: rbps with homology to the sub-group iii phage rbps; purple: rbps with homology to the sub-group iv phage rbps

sub-group i adhesion modules
phage bk5-t is the representative model selected for analysis of the sub-group i adhesion module. this phage encodes a large dit protein  followed by a protein that is believed to specify both the tal and rbp functions at its n- and c-terminus, respectively. based on a previous morphological analysis this phage was shown to possess a very long tail fibre protruding from the distal region of the tail that is likely corresponding to this fused tal-rbp protein  <cit> . while phages c <dig> and  <dig> group together with the sub-group iii phages based on overall content by mcl analysis, they possess rbps with a higher level of similarity to that of bk5-t compared to those of other representatives of sub-group iii . furthermore, phage  <dig>  which groups with sub-group ii phages in mcl analysis of overall proteomic content, encodes a rbp with similarity to the rbp domain of bk5-t. hhpred analysis of the tal/rbps of c <dig> and  <dig> highlight the conservation of the gp27-like tal domain at the n-terminus  followed by a collagen helix  and a rbp head domain  . the tal/rbp of bk5-t possesses a long collagen-like fibre between a bppa-like carbohydrate binding module  and the head domain . this baseplate structure is fully comparable to that of lactobacillus phages j- <dig> and pl- <dig>  which also possess large, so-called evolved and cbm-containing dit and tal proteins  <cit> .

in this study, we assessed the host range of the phages displaying adhesion devices with similarity to the sub-group i phage bk5-t  and thereby demonstrated that phage  <dig> can infect a cwps c-type strain, phage  <dig> can infect a cwps a-type strain, while phage c <dig> can infect strains of cwps a and c-types .

sub-group ii adhesion modules
the sub-group ii phages are the best studied p <dig> phages with the baseplate structure of both tp901- <dig> and tuc <dig> resolved   <cit> . the primary components of the baseplates of these phages are identical with the exception that tuc <dig> encodes the accessory baseplate protein, the cbm-containing bppa, which is absent in tp901- <dig>  detailed analysis of the adhesion modules of this group is presented herein.

the dit proteins of all sub-group ii phages are  <dig> residues long , are considered classical dit proteins as their fold is comparable to those of x-ray crystal structures of spp <dig>  <cit>  and tp901- <dig> <cit>  , which have been shown to form a hexameric ring with a peripheral galectin-like domain. the tal proteins of sub-group ii phages are also well conserved  and these are believed to form trimers located at the distal extremity of the tail tip in contact with the dit hexamer  <cit> . the n-terminus of these proteins  possesses strong structural homology to gp <dig> of t <dig> and to a type vi secretion system component, vgrg. the sub-group ii tal proteins are between  <dig> and  <dig> residues in size with highly conserved n- and c-terminal regions interjected by a variable mid-region spanning from amino acid residues 343– <dig> of the protein .

in contrast to the relative conservation of other elements of the adhesion module of sub-group ii phages, the bppu proteins are quite variable with two apparent groups: the classical bppu encoded by tuc <dig>  tp901- <dig>  ul <dig>  p <dig>   <dig>  and those encoded by  <dig>   <dig>  98202– <dig> and 98101– <dig>  which are considerably longer . phages that encode a bppa also possess a c-terminal extension in their respective bppu proteins that acts as the bppa “hanger” anchoring it to the baseplate  <cit> . bppus are assembled as trimers with their n-terminal  <dig> residues assembled around the dit ring. a three-helix bundle is projected out of the ring adjacent to a β-sandwich trimeric structure that serves to attach the rbp.

the majority of sub-group ii phages incorporate bppa elements which add cbms to the baseplate  <cit> . the n- and c-termini of the bppas of these phages are well conserved and are interrupted by a much less conserved middle region  corresponding to a variable cbm, suggesting phage-specific carbohydrate binding affinities .

the newly isolated phages including  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> appear to possess baseplates that are similar to those found in tuc <dig> and tp901- <dig>  yet with some modifications, expanding the current knowledge on sub-group ii phages. for example, phage  <dig>  which in many respects appears similar to the tuc2009/tp901- <dig> arrangement, encodes a much larger bppu , which is  <dig> aa in length as opposed to the tuc2009/tp901- <dig> bppu which is  <dig> aa; table 2). bppu <dig> corresponds to the bppu of tp901- <dig>  but does not possess the rbp attachment domain mentioned above. furthermore, bppu <dig> possesses a large rhamnogalacturanase a-like cbm or cazyme domain . additionally, phage  <dig> encodes a second bppu-like protein ), which exhibits structural identity to a short bppu β-sandwich n-terminal domain . phage  <dig> is similar to this but encodes two bppa-like proteins . bppa <dig> is similar to the tuc <dig> classical bppa, while bppa <dig> possesses a collagen-like linker domain and a phage p2-like  rbp-like domain . phages  <dig> and  <dig> further diverge from the tuc <dig> sub-family as they are devoid of bppa and encode a distinct rbp, yet specify a long bppu. this highlights the diversity of arrangements of the sub-group ii adhesion devices, which may incorporate a single component, large rbp-encoding gene or multi-component peripheral baseplate proteins  .

the sub-group ii phages are capable of infecting cwps type a and/or c, or only cwps type b strains highlighting the flexibility of interactions of this group of phages, possibly through the diversification of rbp and the presence of large, multi-domain rbp proteins with multiple carbohydrate binding domains, in many cases, observed among the sub-group ii phages .

sub-group iii adhesion modules
the dit proteins of sub-group iii phages are larger than that of tp901- <dig> and are, in fact, closer in size to that of the  <dig> group phage p <dig> . in phage lc <dig>  a 25-residue loop is incorporated within the galectin domain, resembling that of phage p <dig>  yet not present in the tp901-1-like dit. in congruence with the  <dig> phage p <dig> dit similarities, the tal of this phage consists only of the t <dig> gp27-like domain . sub-group iii is comprised of a small group of phages including r1t, lc <dig> and dub35a. these phages display a degree of heterogeneity among their respective rbps. the rbps of lc <dig>  and dub35a  are 94% identical at the amino acid level and both infect l. lactis  <dig> among the strains employed in this study. the rbp encoded by r1t  bears over 90% aa identity to that of lc <dig> and dub35a across most of its protein length, yet exhibits a unique c-terminus reflecting its host-specific interacting domain likely explaining its distinctive host range.

sub-group iv phage adhesion modules
sub-group iv is embodied by q <dig>  bm <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the structural characteristics of this group mirror those of the sub-group iii phages with the dit and tal displaying the characteristics of the  <dig> group phage equivalents. these phages all employ a small protein of approximately  <dig> amino acids as their rbp and are typified by having “stubby” distal tail regions unlike the typical double-disc or broad baseplate encoded by sub-group ii phages or long tail fibre structures typically observed in sub-group i phages  <cit> . in this regard, they appear more like the sub-group iii phages r1t and lc <dig>  which also display the stubby distal tail region and encode small rbp proteins. these rbps are well conserved within the group and there are no component members with significant homology with p <dig> phage rbps beyond this group . the sub-group iv phages are largely confined to infecting cwps type a strains with the exception of q <dig>  which infects multiple strains of various cwps types .

p <dig> phages in the collection display a preference for cwps type a and c strains
seventeen lactococcal p <dig> phages were isolated from whey samples derived from cheese production facilities across europe and north america, japan and australia. the host range of the phages was assessed against the bank of  <dig> lactococcal strains and the results are presented in fig. 3a. this assessment revealed unique infective profiles for each of the assessed phages, while also highlighting a narrow host range of these phages, typical of lactococcal phages, with the exception of q <dig>  which was previously shown to be a broad host range phage.

strains that were identified as sensitive to the phages in this study were typed according to the multiplex pcr system devised in  <dig>  <cit> , as cwps genotype a, b, c , based on the size of the generated pcr amplicon . using this system, it seems that the p <dig> phages within our collection largely infect cwps type a strains with a slightly lower number of cwps type c host strains and with very little preference for type b strains . of the  <dig> lactococcal strains assessed in this study,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cwps a, b, c or unknown type strains were infected by  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> phages, respectively. while plaque assays were used in this study to derive if any trends in infective profiles could be observed, it cannot be precluded that the phages employed in the study may bind to additional strains where plaque formation is not necessarily observed, which may alter the strain preference landscape within another phage/strain collection. therefore, the relationship between p <dig> phage isolates and strain collections should be assessed on the specific collections in future studies to validate this finding.

calcium-dependent plaque formation by p <dig> phages
in previous studies, we have shown that tp901- <dig>  ul <dig> and p <dig> do not require calcium for plaque formation, unlike members of the  <dig> phage group and other p <dig> phages, including q <dig> and tuc <dig>  which exhibit a calcium dose-dependent plaque formation phenotype  <cit> . to assess the full extent of the requirement for calcium among p <dig> phages and to assess a genetic linkage to this phenotype, calcium dependency assays were undertaken. in this assay, the efficiency of plaquing by phages in the presence of  <dig>  mm edta  relative to the titre in the presence of 10 mm cacl <dig> was determined including control phages for which this data had previously been determined and are indicated below. this assay revealed that tp901- <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  dub35a, lc <dig>  ul <dig>  and p <dig>  were calcium-independent both in terms of plaque formation and size . conversely, tuc <dig> , q <dig>  ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> display ca-dependency with q <dig> unable to produce plaques in the presence of edta and at least a 4-log reduction in e.o.p. for the remainder of the affected phages. additionally, while c <dig>   <dig>  98101– <dig>  ul <dig> and p <dig> do not show significant reduction in e.o.p. in the presence of edta, there is a very clear reduction in plaque size, which may be an indication of burst size reduction. therefore, calcium appears to play a beneficial role in the development of these phages, even if not essential for plaque formation.

identification of the rbp of lc <dig> & q33
the baseplates of the sub-group ii phages tuc <dig> and tp901- <dig> are well studied and the baseplate elements have been identified and functionally characterized through structural and biological analyses  <cit> . therefore, based on similarity searches the receptor recognition functions of the sub-group ii phages can be attributed to the encoded bppl  proteins and to the c-terminal end of the large single gene rbps of the sub-group ii phages. this also aids in the positive assignment of the rbp of q <dig> and lc3/dub35a since the c-termini of their predicted rbps bear homology to the bppl proteins encoded by tuc <dig> and tp901- <dig>  respectively. anti-343lc <dig> antibodies were employed in infection inhibition assays and it was observed that lc <dig>  dub35a and tp901- <dig> infection was almost completely inactivated by pre-incubation with these antibodies through binding and neutralizing the distal tail region . this is consistent with the sequence homology observed between the proposed rbps of these phages . furthermore, phages with non-homologous rbp sequences were not observed to be neutralized by these antibodies . since we were unable to obtain antibodies against the proposed rbp of q <dig>  and due to the sequence similarity of the c-terminus of rbpq <dig> with bppltuc <dig> , antibody inactivation assays were performed with the same set of phages using antibodies against bppltuc <dig> to ascertain if infectivity of q <dig>  as expected, could be inhibited in a similar manner. indeed, this resulted in a 4-log reduction in e.o.p. for tuc <dig> and a 2-log reduction in e.o.p. for q <dig>  while none of the other tested phages were affected by the presence of the anti-bppltuc <dig> antibodies .

multiplex pcr for the classification of p <dig> phages
seven pairs of primers were designed to facilitate the detection and classification of emerging p <dig> phage isolates. primers were designed based on the rbp-encoding genes of phages belonging to sub-groups i, ii, iii or iv and owing to the apparent diversity of the sub-group ii phages, primers were additionally designed to enable the detection of the various rbp-related sequences of the phages. the primers were applied as individual primer pairs and in a multiplex format using dna extracted from phage/phage mixtures suspended in whey. when individual primer pairs were applied, all phages could be specifically detected  from a mixed phage suspension with a limit of detection in whey of approximately  <dig> pfu.ml− <dig> ; however as a multiplex pcr, only  <dig> and lc3-based primers yielded the expected products and with a limit of detection of  <dig> pfu.ml− <dig>  therefore, while these primers may not be applicable in the identification of phages in a multiplex pcr assay , they may be applied to discern and classify emerging phages in surveys, which are routinely performed globally in research and industry alike.fig.  <dig> a representative image displaying the amplicons generated using individual primer pairs against the dna extract of whey-based phage mix suspension. lane 1: molecular weight marker ; lane 2:  <dig> ; lane 3:  <dig> ; lane 4: tuc <dig> ; lane 5:  <dig> ; lane 6:  <dig> ; lane 7:  <dig> ; lane 8: lc <dig> . similar results were obtained from the dna extracts of serially diluted phage suspensions . the size of representative bands on the mw marker are provided on the left




discussion
pan-genome analysis of publicly available p <dig> phages performed in  <dig> suggested that the pan-genome of p <dig> phages is “open” as it appears as an exponential curve indicating that the addition of new genome sequences will increase the existing body of data for this particular phage group  <cit> . in the current study,  <dig> novel p <dig> phages were isolated from a wide range of geographical locations and the emergence of this additional genomic data was employed to derive a further appreciation of the genetic diversity of these phages. mcl analysis of the  <dig> currently available p <dig> phage proteomes demonstrated that the four proposed sub-groups of p <dig> phages are upheld  <cit>  with newly identified members for each of the p <dig> sub-groups i, ii, iii and iv . while the grouping of p <dig> phages was previously proposed based on overall genomic content and morphology, for the purposes of phage-host interaction analysis and predictions, the elements of the adhesion device were used as the differentiation factor in this study. in fact, this may be a more useful differentiation and classification tool for future isolates.

modern fermentation facilities and starter culture providers are typically well equipped and increasingly employ molecular diagnostic tools as a means to detect and classify starter strains and their phages. therefore, up-to-date methods are required to aid in the constant battle against phage predation. molecular tools to classify lactococcal strains have previously been described  <cit> , as have tools for the detection and classification of lactococcal phages  <cit> . however, while the phage classification scheme devised over 15 years ago reflected sequenced phages at that time and has been largely upheld, it is no longer valid for the detection of all p <dig> phages since the dutpase-encoding gene is absent in the genomes of  <dig> and dub35a. as increasing sequence data emerges for the p <dig> phages, the extent of complexity of their genomes is becoming apparent and without a single gene that may be used as a genetic fingerprint for the p <dig> phages it is impossible to detect all members of this group. to counter this problem, a pcr set-up specifically designed to reflect all known members of the p <dig> group was devised as part of this study, providing a useful tool for the discrimination of p <dig> phage isolates that emerge in phage screening studies. while a multiplex pcr approach may not be applicable to discriminate p <dig> phages in whey samples, it is possible to employ the multiplex pcr on purified phages and their extracts  thus advocating its potential as a classification tool after phage isolates have been selectively propagated to complement host range data.

the rbps of the sub-group ii phages tp901- <dig> and tuc <dig> represent the best studied rbps of gram-positive infecting phages . the functional assignment of the rbp of the  phages in sub-group ii is justified based on these studies. unlike the sub-group ii phages, the rbp-encoding genes of phages from the other sub-groups  are less well studied and the assignment is mainly based on blast similarities and/or the relative position of their encoding gene within the genome  <cit> . to validate these functional assignments, antibodies specific to the predicted rbp of lc <dig>  and tuc <dig>  were employed in infection neutralization assays against phages encoding rbps from sub-group i, iii and iv. the anti-343lc <dig> antibodies neutralized lc <dig>  dub35a and tp901- <dig>  all of which bear sequence similarity in the c-terminal receptor-interacting domain of their rbps . other phages tested in this study were not inhibited in the presence of the antibody confounding their specificity and positively identifying the rbps of lc <dig>  dub35a and confirming that of tp901- <dig>  in a similar manner anti-bppltuc <dig> antibodies were proven to reduce the efficiency of plaquing of tuc <dig> and q <dig>  the lower efficacy of the anti-bppltuc <dig> compared to that of the anti-343lc <dig> antibodies against tuc <dig> may be a reflection of the exposed regions of the purified protein against which the antibodies were raised, which may differ from its native folding thus reducing its ability to block the active binding site of the phages.

while the majority of p <dig> phages employed in this study display a very narrow host range, many are capable of infecting a- and c-cwps strains within our collection. exceptions to the narrow host specificity observation are q <dig> and bm <dig>  which exhibit an unusually broad host range and are capable of infecting strains among all three identified cwps types   <cit> . these phages may thus recognize and attach to saccharides that are common among all lactococcal cwps structures. conversely, phages 98101– <dig> specifically infect a single strain of unknown cwps type, which may highlight the presence of a novel saccharidic receptor moiety for these phages or that the composition and/or architecture of the cwps of this strain is quite different to those of the currently classified types  . it was aimed to explore a possible link between the various rbp sub-groups of the p <dig> phages to cwps type of strains as was previously observed for the  <dig> phages  <cit> . no such direct correlation between specific rbp sub-groups of p <dig> phages and cwps types appears to exist within the phages/strains tested but rather that there is a higher proportion of cwps a strains infected by the phages employed in this study . while the current study employs a limited number of strains and phages and the results may be specific to our collection, it would appear that there is preference for cwps type a strains  among the p <dig> phages in this and previous studies and with a secondary preference for cwps type c strains in contrast to the  <dig> phages. should this trend hold true for p <dig> phage isolates that emerge in other studies in the future, it would be advisable to promote the limited application of cwps type a  in fermentation plants with a prevalence of p <dig> phages and potentially the incorporation of cwps type b strains in such facilities.

through this and previous studies, it has been established that the majority of lactococcal phages do not strictly require calcium for plaque formation although in many cases it has a beneficial effect on plaque size and the timing of lysis  <cit> . here, it is observed that all sequenced sub-group iv members specifically require calcium for plaque formation and in the presence of edta , these phages display at least a 5-log reduction in e.o.p. . the observation of calcium-dependent plaque formation for sub-group iv but not sub-group iii phages suggests that while the sub-group iv phages may require baseplate activation like the  <dig> phages, sub-group iii phages may be activated by an alternative mechanism or factor than calcium binding or may be in an “infection-ready” configuration thus not requiring activation. the sub-group ii phage tuc <dig> is an exception among the sub-group ii phages in its requirement for divalent cations for plaque-formation, which may be explained, at least partially, by the sequence homology between the c-terminus of its rbp and that of the sub-group iv phage q <dig> 

bioinformatic analysis of phages infecting diverse bacterial species including staphylococcus aureus phage  <dig>  listeria phage a <dig> and bacillus subtilis phage spp <dig> has revealed the conservation of structural, genetic and functional characteristics . furthermore, it was identified that bppa-like cbds are widespread among phages highlighting the conservation of beneficial features among diverse phages. the architectural and modular conservation of the adhesion modules of phages infecting pathogenic and non-pathogenic gram positive bacteria highlights the broader significance of model lactococcal phages. it highlights the conservation of genetic and structural features throughout the phage realm. it is also clear that modular shuffling and duplication among phages are common occurrences, which serve to enhance the adaptive agility and evolutionary success of these viruses.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this study has enhanced current understanding of the host preference of p <dig> phages and the genetic complexity of this industrially significant group of phages. the positive identification of the rbp-encoding genes of q <dig>  lc <dig> and dub35a serves to strengthen the functional assignment of rbps of emerging phage isolates and consolidates lactococcal phages as the model system for siphoviridae phages infecting gram-positive bacteria with implications for food fermentations, phage evolution and phage therapeutic systems.
