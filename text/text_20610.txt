BACKGROUND
elucidating the factors involved in threonine homoeostasis is important for the development of nutritional strategies in human clinical diets for treating patients suffering from wasting diseases. in farmed animals the regulation of livestock feed is required to ensure optimal growth and to reduce nitrogen excretion which poses environmental disposal problems. threonine is required for protein synthesis and the removal of excess threonine by oxidation is needed to prevent its accumulation both intracellularly and in the circulation. the rate of catabolism of many amino acids, including threonine, increases when dietary protein exceeds the body's requirements. gluconeogenesis occurs mainly in the liver where it helps maintain blood glucose homeostasis in mammals. during starvation amino acid catabolism increases to support gluconeogenesis. glucocorticoids and glucagon hormones are known to up regulate and insulin down regulate the gene expression of many amino acid-catabolising enzymes  <cit> .

there are three l-threonine  degradation pathways in living organisms; via l-threonine aldolase , via l-serine/threonine dehydratase  and via l-threonine 3-dehydrogenase   <cit> . l-threonine is broken down by; l-ta to yield glycine and acetaldehyde, by sdh to yield nh4+ and 2-ketobutyrate and tdh to yield 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate. the subsequent reaction between 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate and coenzyme a to form glycine and acetyl-coa is catalysed by 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate coenzyme a ligase , also called glycine acetyltransferase .

together with the cofactor, pyridoxal-5'-phosphate , sdh uses threonine and serine as substrates to generate glycine which is used in gluconeogenesis. serine dehydratase-like  <dig> gene  is a second sdh gene found in vertebrates, but has yet to be characterised. i suggest that it is also a putative l-threonine catabolising enzyme.

vitamin b6-dependant enzymes can be grouped according to their fold type. l-ta belongs to fold type i. l-ta enzymes are unrelated to d-ta enzymes which possess type iii folds  <cit> . in vertebrates, the ta enzyme has not been purified by protein fractionation, only assayed in homogenised tissue fractions and isolated hepatocytes. in vertebrates most l-threonine degradation occurs via the enzymatic activities of serine/threonine dehydratase and threonine dehydrogenase. however, the presence of threonine aldolase enzymatic activity has been demonstrate in rat liver extracts  <cit> . threonine aldolase contributes 1–3% of total threonine degradation under a variety of nutritional states in both rat and quail  <cit> .

l-tas from a number of species of bacteria and fungi have been isolated and characterized . in the yeast, saccharomyces cerevisiae, the glycine synthase- <dig> gene, gly <dig> was identified as threonine aldolase  <cit> . previously, gene ablation studies had shown that the gly <dig> pathway is a major source of glycine  <cit> . but it only plays a minor role in candida albicans  <cit> . in a number of bacteria species such as escherichia coli, aeromonas jandaei, pseudomonas and thermatoga maritima the gly <dig> gene has been cloned and their enzymatic activity characterised  <cit> . in thale cress, arabidopsis thaliana, there are two threonine aldolase genes . tha <dig> has been shown to play a role in seed nutritional quality  <cit> . putative gly <dig> genes have been also identified in nematodes and flies  <cit> . recently, the x-ray crystal structures of l-threonine aldolase from the bacteria thermotoga maritima have been determined as the apo-enzyme, bound to l-allo-threonine and to glycine  <cit> .

these gly1/threonine aldolases are distinct from the serine hydroxymethyltransferases . however, some shmt also possess some threonine aldolase enzymatic activity. shmt from e. coli and the yogurt bacterium, streptococcus thermophilus, have ta activity  <cit> . shmt isolated from rabbit liver has been shown to possess weak ta activity  <cit> . consequently, it has been thought that the minor threonine aldolase activity in liver extracts was due solely to shmt, and that mammals lack a true threonine aldolase, but this has been questioned  <cit> . here i report that ta genes are present in vertebrates.

RESULTS
analysis of murine l-threonine aldolase cdnas
i conducted a search of the genbank database for a putative mouse l-threonine aldolase gene using the sequence of the e. coli ta protein  <cit> . pcr primers were designed to the 5' and 3' ends of est sequences that matched the genomic dna sequence of the putative l-threonine aldolase gene. these primers were used to amplify the cdna from murine liver rna by rt-pcr. the amplicons were electrophoresised on an agarose gel. two bands of similar intensity were obtained. both bands were excised from the gel, cloned and sequenced. the upper band encoded an  <dig> bp murine l-threonine aldolase cdna sequence. it has a  <dig> bp 5'utr containing an in-frame stop codon, an orf which encodes a  <dig> residue protein and has an attaaa polyadenylation signal at 1822– <dig> . the predicted protein has a  <dig>  da molecular mass and an isoelectric point  <dig> . the lower band encoded a second cdna clone that was identical to the first clone except that it skipped exon  <dig>  on translation, this results in a frame shift in the orf that would encode a severely truncated protein of  <dig> residues that would not be expected to have any enzymatic activity . both cdna sequences matched the mouse genomic dna sequence. the mouse l-threonine aldolase/gly <dig> gene is located on chromosome  <dig> band e <dig>  towards the telomere, between the baculoviral iap repeat-containing  <dig>  and suppressor of cytokine signalling  <dig>  genes. the l-threonine aldolase gene spans  <dig>  kb, consisting of  <dig> exons . all splice donor/acceptor sites have consensus gt/ag dinucleotides. there is a  <dig> bp cpg island  encompassing exon  <dig>  such cpg islands are generally associated with active housekeeping genes  <cit> . the predicted start of transcription, ccat, on the genomic dna is just  <dig> bp upstream of the cdna sequence suggesting that the clone is almost full-length.

predicted secondary structure of the murine threonine aldolase protein
a comparison of the predicted secondary structure of the murine ta protein with the known secondary structure of t. maritima  <cit>  is shown . the proteins have 44% identity and 81% similarity and are similar throughout their length. overall there is good correspondence between the position of the predicted α-helices and β-sheets in the murine protein with those determined from the crystal structure of t. maritima. however, the mouse protein has an additional putative amino-terminal mitochondrial import leader peptide. given long evolutionary distance between mouse and bacteria this high degree of homology strongly suggests that this murine protein is also a threonine aldolase. most functional residues are conserved between the two proteins. by homology with the t. maritima protein, lys <dig> is expected to form a schiff-base with the cofactor, pyridoxal-5'-phosphate , with asp <dig> and arg <dig> expected to interact with plp. those residues that contact the ligands l-allo-threonine and glycine, ser <dig>  his <dig>  tyr <dig>  arg <dig> and arg <dig>  are conserved. t. maritima his <dig> from the second subunit is predicted to bind the hydroxyl group of l-threonine. this residue is homologous to murine tyr <dig>  a conservative substitution since both residues are polar and aromatic. in other ta proteins from diverse phyla this residue is mainly histidine, but in rice it is a tyrosine also. at the catalytic dimer interface electrostatic interactions occur among the side chains of arg44-glu <dig>  thr47-asp <dig> and arg274-ser <dig>  these residues are conserved. residues involved in ion coordination are also conserved with ala <dig>  thr <dig> and ser <dig> contacting ca2+ with arg <dig> contacting a chloride ion. in the arabidopsis tha <dig> enzyme a gly <dig> to arg mutation, located between two beta-sheets, results in loss of enzymatic activity  <cit> . this residue, gly <dig> in mouse, is conserved in all four vertebrate ta enzymes.

sequence homology to other vertebrate threonine aldolase proteins
database searches revealed the presence of other l-threonine aldolase genes in other vertebrates . there is a single seven exon gene in the japanese puffer fish genome . the exon/exon boundaries on the proteins are highly conserved between mouse and japanese puffer fish with only one being displaced slightly. the japanese puffer fish gene encodes a 421-residue protein that has 46% identity and 74% similarity to the murine protein. similar l-threonine aldolase cdnas for the western-clawed frog and the zebrafish were identified . the proteins are of similar lengths with the functional residues identified in t. maritima being well conserved. homology extends throughout their lengths, apart from the amino-terminal regions. despite their low sequence identity in the amino-terminal region all four proteins contain putative mitochondrial import leader peptides, being positively charged. they possess also a predicted cleavage site that would be utilised during their import into mitochondria. after cleavage of the mitochondrial import sequence the mature murine ta enzyme would have a mass  <dig>  da and pi  <dig> . recently, two other vertebrate gly <dig> genes have been sequenced. in the dog there is a complete gene  that would encode a 391-residue protein with 82% identity and 94% similarity to murine ta. three overlapping unassigned genomic dna sequences from the freshwater puffer fish, tetraodon nigroviridis, would encode a gene encoding a 431-residue protein with 44% identity and 73% similarity to murine ta. additionally, homologous coding ests from mammals , birds , amphibians  and fish  were identified, indicating that l-threonine aldolase expression in vertebrates is widespread.

human gly1/threonine aldolase gene is a pseudogene
a database search identified 17q <dig> as the location for the human gly <dig> gene. all exon/intron boundaries found in the murine threonine aldolase gene are conserved in man. the mouse to human conserved synteny map shows that both gly <dig> genes have the synaptogyrin  <dig> , baculoviral iap repeat-containing  <dig>  and soluble thymidine kinase  <dig>  genes as near neighbours. starting with human liver rna, i was neither able to amplify any threonine aldolase transcripts using a variety of 5' and 3' race methods nor to detect any transcripts in a wide range of tissue and cell line cdnas by rt-pcr. a search of the human est database identified five potential est transcripts scattered throughout the threonine aldolase gene, but they lack supporting evidence that they are truly transcribed sequences, being unspliced singletons. there is a potential polyadenylation signal site in the human threonine aldolase gene with good homology to the murine site. however, corresponding 3'utr ests and sage tags are conspicuously absent from the databases leading to the conclusion that the gly <dig> threonine aldolase gene is not transcribed in man.

if the human gly <dig> threonine aldolase gene were transcribed there are two single nucleotide deletions that would cause frame-shifts. they are the equivalent of murine nucleotide  <dig> in exon  <dig>  and the equivalent of murine nucleotide  <dig> in exon  <dig> . both these deletions are found in genomic dna clones from two individuals showing that these deletions are not sequencing errors . the presence of the frame-shift in exon  <dig> would create a truncated orf of  <dig> residues that does not include the plp-binding lysine residue, consequently the protein would not be functional . also there is a premature in-frame stop codon towards the carboxy-terminal. even if the frame-shifts in the human gly <dig> gene were not present then the translated human ta protein would not function due to the mutation of four important residues. these four residues have remained conserved during evolution since the last common ancestor of the bacteria, t. maritima, and vertebrates. one residue that would be expected to interact with the plp ligand, murine arg <dig>  would be mutated to gln in man. murine residue arg <dig> that would be expected to interact with threonine is mutated to ala. the side chains of two residues that form electrostatic interactions at the catalytic dimer interface are also mutated, murine thr <dig> to lys, and murine arg <dig> to his. if the frame-shifts were not present, the mouse and human proteins would have 66% identity and 85% similarity. likewise, the chimpanzee threonine aldolase gene is a pseudogene possessing the same frame-shifts as the human gene. additionally, it has lost the splice donor site in exon  <dig> and, by comparison with the mouse gene, has a  <dig> bp deletion in exon  <dig> .

homology of serine/threonine dehydratase and serine dehydratase like- <dig> proteins in vertebrates
the sequences of murine sdh and sdh- <dig> cloned cdnas matched those of reference sequences . in mammals, these two genes are adjacent, being arranged in a 5' to 5' orientation. database searches identified both the sdh and sdh <dig> genes in man, rat, freshwater puffer fish and the western and african clawed frogs. but in the chicken only the sdh <dig> gene is present since sdh is absent from the draft genome and all expressed sequences. a comparison of vertebrate sdh and sdh <dig> proteins with the crystal structure of rat sdh  <cit>  suggests that sdh <dig> is also a serine/threonine dehydratase because residues with important functions are conserved . by homology, lys <dig> of murine sdh <dig> is the plp binding residue forming a schiff base and the amino acid sequence around lys <dig> sxkirg is well-conserved in other sdhs from vertebrates, plants, yeasts and bacteria  <cit> . two other conserved amino acid sequences, sgna and gggg and cys <dig>  form hydrogen bonds with plp. in sdh <dig> a potassium ion near the active site would be expected to be coordinated by six oxygen atoms, five of which are from conserved residues; gly <dig>  glu <dig>  ala <dig>  ser <dig>  leu <dig>  but ala <dig> replaces val <dig> of rat sdh.

expression of threonine aldolase, serine/threonine dehydratase and serine dehydratase like- <dig> mrna in mouse tissues
to identify those tissues which are likely to contribute to ta activity in the mouse, the expression of ta mrna in adult tissues was examined by rt-real time pcr normalised to the expression of the housekeeping genes, β-actin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase . low levels of ta mrna were detected in all tissues examined. they varied 20-fold between tissues, being highest in prostate, heart and liver . in contrast, the mrna levels of sdh, another enzyme that catabolises l-threonine, has a very specific tissue distribution. it is expressed highly in the liver at a level similar to the two housekeeping genes. it is over  <dig> fold more abundant in liver than heart, the second highest expressing tissue . low levels of sdh <dig> mrna were found also in all tissues. like sdh, sdh <dig> was most abundant in the liver with moderate levels being found in testis, heart, kidney and spleen .

expression of threonine catabolic enzymes in mouse embryos
the mrna expression of threonine catabolic enzymes was examined by real time pcr in cdnas derived from whole mouse embryos from days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . overall, ta, tdh and sdh expression were low prior to e- <dig>  but increased more then four-fold by e- <dig>  kbl expression was low at e- <dig>  but increased earlier than the other enzymes. sdh <dig> did not change substantially with increasing embryonic age.

discussion
in vertebrates, l-threonine is one of the indispensable amino acids. it is obtained from protein in the diet, typically being the second or third limiting amino acid in herbivorous diets. some of it is utilized in synthesising new protein, but the rest is converted to other amino acids by oxidative catabolism by three different enzymes that are found in most organisms; tdh, ta and sdh. both the tdh and ta pathways produce glycine. however, the tdh pathway occurs in two steps, requiring kbl as the second step. using protein homology searches of the mouse genome with the bacterial enzymes has allowed me to identify and clone tdh and kbl cdnas  <cit> . gly1/ta genes have been identified previously in bacteria, fungi and plants  <cit> . here i describe the first ta cdna found in vertebrates. the murine ta cdna encodes a 400-residue protein that is highly similar to that from t. maritima with an expect value of 2e- <dig>  being clearly distinct from glycine dehydrogenase, the second most closely related protein, with an expect value of  <dig> . this remarkable conservation, over billions of years of evolution since the last common ancestor, shows the general importance of these metabolic pathways. however, the presence of some abnormal ta mrna splicing in mouse, the low levels of mrna found in mouse tissues, together with the low levels of ta enzymatic activity found in rat liver  <cit>  plus the loss of a functional ta gene in humans suggests that ta has reduced importance in mammals.

the l-ta enzymes can act on the stereoisomers, l-threonine and l-allo-threonine. these can be divided into three types based on the stereospecificity towards the β-carbon of threonine. low-specificity l-ta can use both l-threonine and l-allo-threonine as substrates. l-ta only acts on l-threonine and l-allo-ta is specific to l-allo-threonine  <cit> . murine l-ta is likely to be a low-specificity l-ta with a preferences for the allo isomer in a manner similar to the t. maritima enzyme, because tyr <dig>  in the ta active site is conserved, a residue which appears to be involved in discriminating l-threonine from l-allo-threonine  <cit> .

all the vertebrate ta proteins have putative amino-terminal mitochondrial import sequences, suggesting that the mitochondrion is its intracellular localisation. in contrast, fractionation studies in the yeast, s. cerevisiae, revealed a cytosolic localisation for ta  <cit> . additionally, the yeast ta protein does not possess an amino-terminal mitochondrial import sequence. in vertebrates, threonine catabolism is mostly confined to the liver when the mass of the organ is taken into consideration. expression of sdh, tdh and kbl mrna are highest in liver  <cit> . however, low levels of murine ta expression were found in a wide range of tissues suggesting a role in housekeeping metabolism in all tissues. generally, during embryogenesis, expression of threonine catabolic enzymes increased with maturation of the developing liver.

humans have lost two of the three enzymes of threonine catabolism with both gly <dig> and tdh  <cit>  genes being defective, both pathways produce glycine from threonine. in man, the loss of a functional gly <dig> gene appears to be a more ancient event than the loss of tdh because gly <dig> genes in both man and chimpanzees have a number of frame-shifts and mutations of functional amino acid residues, whereas the mutated exon  <dig> splice-acceptor site in human tdh is intact in chimpanzees . this suggests that gly <dig> has been lost prior to, and tdh after, the divergence of man and chimpanzees, about 6– <dig> million years ago. consequently, humans may not be as metabolically well equipped as other species to cope with diets high in threonine/protein. perhaps a reduction in the rate of threonine catabolism in man's ancestors would have conferred a selective advantage on those individuals with these defective genes under conditions of protein starvation. although humans have lost both the glycinergic pathways of threonine catabolism their gut microbial flora will have both ta and tdh enzymes, therefore, gut microbial flora may make significant contributions to human threonine catabolism.

with the loss of ta and tdh genes in humans this leaves serine/threonine dehydratase as our only major threonine catabolic enzyme. however, vertebrates also have a second sdh gene, called sdh-like- <dig> which, by homology, is likely to function also as a serine/threonine dehydratase since all the residues that bind the plp co-factor are conserved between the two proteins. only the sdh <dig> gene is present in the chicken, therefore the serine dehydratase activity found in chick livers  <cit>  must be due to sdh <dig> 

the shmt enzymes are members of the α-class of pyridoxal phosphate enzymes, catalyzing the reversible interconversion of serine and glycine. mammals have two shmt genes. one encodes a cytosolic and the other a mitochondrial enzyme. purified shmt enzyme from rat liver possesses some threonine aldolase activity  <cit>  and both shmt genes may also contribute to threonine catabolism in vertebrates.

with the identification of murine ta and sdh- <dig> mrna the way is open to study their enzymatic activity in vitro and relative contribution to threonine catabolism under different physiological states in vivo. changes in ta and sdh- <dig> mrna expression in response to diet have yet to be examined, but rats fed a high protein diet or fasted showed an increase in ta enzymatic activity  <cit> . in contrast, quails and rats fasted or on threonine enriched diets did not show any statistically significant changes in ta enzymatic activity  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
i have shown that gly1/ta genes are present in vertebrates. ta genes and enzymatic activities have been previously isolated from bacteria, fungi and plants. these enzymes are distinct from the serine hydroxymethyltransferases. the mouse gly <dig> gene is located on chromosome  <dig>  band e <dig> and the  <dig> bp cdna from this gene encodes a 400-residue threonine aldolase. the presence of a positively-charged amino-terminal import leader peptide sequence in mammalian, amphibian and fish ta proteins, that are not present in bacterial proteins, suggests that the vertebrate ta enzymes are mitochondrial. man and chimpanzees have lost a functional gly <dig> gene. vertebrates also have a second sdh gene, sdh <dig>  that by homology to the crystal structure of sdh may function as a threonine dehydratase and contribute to threonine catabolism.
