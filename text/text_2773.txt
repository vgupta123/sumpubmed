BACKGROUND
berry development is a complex process displaying a double sigmoidal growth curve with three distinct phases, including two periods of growth separated by a lag phase during which expansion slows and seeds mature  <cit> . cells are established in the first two weeks following flowering, and during the initial growth phase a rapid increase in berry size occurs as a result of cell expansion. the biosynthesis of tannins and hydroxycinnamates and several phenolic compound precursors takes place in the first growth phase  <cit> , and organic acids accumulate in the vacuoles, with malic acid reaching a peak concentration before veraison and then decreasing throughout the second half of the growing season  <cit> . the short period known as veraison marks the boundary between the lag phase and the third phase of development, and is characterised by the initiation of sugar accumulation, a loss of photosynthetic capacity  <cit> , and the rapid pigmentation of berries by anthocyanins in red grape varieties  <cit> . high levels of glucose and fructose accumulate after veraison while organic acid levels decrease; the resulting acid to sugar ratio present at harvest is one of the most important contributors to wine sensory characteristics  <cit> . towards the end of this third phase of berry development, a number of compounds including terpenes, norisoprenoids, esters and thiols are synthesised  <cit> . the properties of the berry at harvest, including the final mix of primary and secondary metabolites that accumulate during ripening, are an important determinant of the quality, and therefore value, of the wine produced.

although the biochemical and physical changes that occur during berry development are well characterised  <cit> , the biological processes that control them are less well understood. to a large extent, the biophysical changes that occur during the complex process of grape berry development must be influenced by the presence and activity of metabolic gene pathways. in turn, these metabolic pathways must be controlled by the transcriptional regulation of rna. understanding these pathways will give us a greater understanding of the fundamental processes that control berry development, and provide insights into the genetic basis of grape quality that could potentially benefit the wine industry. to this end, several studies have sought to investigate the transcriptional changes that occur during berry development using dna microarrays  <cit> . microarray analysis has also been used to investigate differences in gene expression between specific grape tissues  <cit> , and in grapes exposed to a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses or imposed changes to growth conditions  <cit> . additionally, a collection of microarrays has recently been combined with rna sequencing to form a grapevine gene expression atlas  <cit> . the major limitation of most previous microarray studies is that they have generally been limited to interrogating only a portion of the total transcriptome. many genes are not represented on the microarrays commonly used for grape analysis, while genes that exist in large and highly similar families may give ambiguous expression results due to non-specific hybridisation. furthermore, the ability of probes to measure transcript abundance is constrained by the accuracy of sequences upon which the array was designed, which is particularly important given the high level of allelic variation in the v. vinifera species  <cit> , and the genomic differences between commercial varieties.

the more recent microarray studies have benefited from substantial progress in defining the v. vinifera genome in the last five years. the genomes of the variety pinot noir and a pinot noir-derived variety named pn <dig> have been sequenced by two consortia, providing an invaluable resource for studying the molecular mechanisms influencing grape development  <cit> . the v. vinifera genome, however, is highly complex and there have been difficulties in producing accurate genomic scaffolds due to its highly heterozygous nature  <cit> . the pn <dig> variety was specifically bred to near-homozygosity to facilitate genomic sequencing and assembly, but most cultivated varieties are extremely heterozygous with allelic differences of up to 13%  <cit> . the difficulties in genomic assembly have been compounded by the relatively high number of transposons  <cit> , and the fact that some gene families are highly repeated and interspersed with numerous pseudo genes  <cit> . nevertheless, algorithmic predictions of the grapevine transcriptome, combined with a large amount of expressed sequence tag  data, have been used to design and annotate microarray platforms for the interrogation of grape berry transcripts. although valuable data on transcriptional regulation in grapes has been reported, the aforementioned technical limitations of microarrays have limited their level of coverage.

massively parallel rna deep-sequencing represents an alternative technological platform for investigating transcriptional regulation. it enables the precise elucidation of transcripts present within a particular sample, and can be used to calculate gene expression based on absolute transcript abundance  <cit> . in the single reported grapevine study to date, zenoni et al.  generated rna sequencing data from vitis vinifera , and provided an initial overview of the complex process of gene regulation during berry development  <cit> . due to the rapidly advancing technology of next generation sequencing, the amount of sequencing data that can be generated in a single experiment has increased dramatically in recent years, as has the length of the sequencing reads. this has led to a greater level of transcriptome coverage and an increase in the specificity, and therefore accuracy, when mapping sequencing reads. importantly, continuous incremental advances in defining the grapevine transcriptome in the form of functional annotation  <cit>  and gene ontology assignment  <cit>  now enable an accurate description of the functional roles of the majority of v. vinifera genes. in this report, we use the latest rna sequencing technology to carry out a comprehensive analysis of the global transcriptional profile of grape berries  during the immature green phase, at early and late veraison, and in ripe berries. we investigate the suitability of a number of reference transcriptomes for rna-seq analysis in grapevine, validate a number of the transcriptional changes observed using quantitative real-time pcr, and describe the biological processes that are enriched in differentially regulated gene clusters.

RESULTS
grape sampling and development
berries from v. vinifera  were sampled at  <dig> to 14-day intervals throughout the growing season, with the shorter intervals occurring in the period coinciding with the expected time of veraison. fruit development was monitored by the measurement of fresh weight and malic acid and tartaric acid content per berry in samples from  <dig> weeks post-anthesis until harvest at  <dig> weeks, and total soluble solids  measurements were taken from  <dig> weeks until harvest. the fresh weight of berries increased throughout the season, with a slowing of growth observed at about  <dig> weeks followed by a rapid increase in fresh weight from  <dig> to  <dig> weeks. malic acid content in berries increased early in the season and peaked at approximately  <dig> weeks post-anthesis . from  <dig> to  <dig> weeks the malic acid content per berry dropped rapidly and continued to decrease until harvest. total soluble solids, as measured by °bx, increased consistently between each sampling point, with the most rapid increase occurring between weeks  <dig> and  <dig> . the end of the herbaceous plateau, decreasing malic acid content and rapidly increasing °bx are examples of the physiological changes that characterise veraison, which is most easily recognised in red grape varieties by the development of pigment over a relatively short period of time . given our interest in the transcriptional changes that may be involved in regulating grape development, based on these data we chose to carry out global mrna sequencing on samples from 3-, 10-, 11- and 17-weeks post-anthesis, corresponding to stage e-l  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> on the modified e-l system  <cit> .

illumina hiseq mrna sequencing
prior to sequencing, rna integrity numbers were determined for poly mrna isolated from each of the four developmental stages using a bioanalyzer  <dig> . calculated values of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, indicated that little degradation of mrna had occurred during extraction or subsequent processing, suggesting full-length or near full-length mrnas were likely to be present and predominant. each of the four mrna samples was indexed with unique nucleic acid identifiers and sequenced on a single lane of an illumina hiseq  <dig> instrument. in total,  <dig> , <dig> reads of  <dig> bp were generated, giving a total of over  <dig> billion nucleotides of sequence data. this compares favourably with the  <dig>  billion nucleotides of sequence data consisting of  <dig> million 36- <dig> bp reads obtained for the previous reported grape berry transcriptome sequencing project  <cit> . in addition to the almost 8-fold higher sequence coverage, the 3-fold longer read length enabled a much greater degree of accuracy when mapping to reference genomes or transcriptomes. de-multiplexing using the unique identifiers revealed that our data consisted of  <dig> , <dig> reads from young berries,  <dig> , <dig> reads from pre-veraison berries,  <dig> , <dig> reads from post-veraison berries and  <dig> , <dig> reads from ripe berries. this provided almost 10-fold higher sequencing read number than a recent illumina-based transcriptome analysis of fruit development in chinese bayberry, which investigated gene regulation based on  <dig>  million  <dig> bp reads  <cit> .

investigation of mapping references for rna-seq analysis
we first investigated a number of reference transcript collections in order to determine whether a comprehensive and accurate description of berry transcriptional profiles could be developed by mapping and counting the reads generated through illumina sequencing against predicted mrna transcripts. two independent groups have generated near-complete v. vinifera  consensus genome assemblies  <cit> , and the former of these groups, the french-italian public consortium for grapevine genome characterization, has released two publically accessible versions of the complete v. vinifera genome at 8x and 12x coverage   <cit> . algorithmic predictions of mrna transcriptomes based on this data and using the gaze computational framework resulted in the prediction of  <dig>  or  <dig>  transcripts from the 8x and 12x genome assemblies, respectively, and provided the first two datasets to which we mapped and counted our sequencing reads. in addition, the national center for biotechnology information reference sequence  database provided an alternative resource of predicted v. vinifera mrna transcripts  <cit> . while ncbi refseq transcripts are based on the 12x genome of jaillon et al. , they are predicted by the gnomon algorithm, which draws on supporting evidence such as ests and alignments to orthologous transcripts and proteins, and are manually curated and continually updated  <cit> . the ncbi refseq nucleotide collection, consisting of  <dig>  annotated transcripts, comprised the third reference dataset for our mapping reference.

the use of an mrna transcript collection as a mapping reference is an alternative approach to that taken by zenoni et al. , who instead used the draft consensus genome reported by jaillon et al.  as a reference. mapping of mrna sequencing reads against genomic scaffolds requires prior knowledge of gene structure, or can be carried out through the use of algorithmic predictions of splice junctions  <cit> . however, given the complexity of the draft consensus genome, its high reported heterozygosity, and the difference in grape variety under investigation, we chose instead to focus on the transcribed component for our analysis. when carrying out rna-seq mapping, we excluded reads with greater than two ambiguous nucleotides, as well as the small proportion of reads that were less than  <dig> bp in length. this resulted in a total pool of  <dig> , <dig> reads from the four developmental stages that were counted for transcript mapping . we used a similarity threshold of 98%, and set the minimum proportion of the read that must match a reference at  <dig>  to allow for the mapping of reads that included up to  <dig> bp of utr in cases where this was not included as part of the mapping reference. somewhat surprisingly only about  <dig> % of our sequencing reads could be mapped against the genoscope 8x or 12x predicted transcriptomes . in contrast,  <dig> % could be mapped to the ncbi refseq collection. the proportion of our sequencing reads mapping to the ncbi refseq collection is actually higher than the proportion of shorter reads that were previously mapped to the vitis vinifera draft consensus genomic scaffolds  <cit> , highlighting the suitability of our chosen mapping reference.


number of illumina hiseq sequencing reads from each developmental stage mapped to selected reference mrna transcript collections. the percentage of counted reads that were mapped is presented in parenthesis.

although the use of a nucleotide mapping reference means the genes investigated in our analysis are determined by pre-existing transcriptomic data, the high percentage of reads mapped under high-stringency conditions indicated a high level of coverage of actual transcribed sequences. additionally, the use of the ncbi refseq nucleotide collection facilitates direct comparison of mapped transcripts with well-described gene functions and manually updated annotations. the method employed by bellin and co-workers  <cit> , whereby pyrosequencing of 3’ cdna ends and de novo contig assembly was used to create a library of unigenes for microarray design, represents an approach to transcriptome analysis that overcomes the issue of predetermined transcript data. this combination of next generation sequencing and microarray generation will be particularly valuable for non-model species for which genomic information is limited. however, in the case of v. vinifera, for which relatively well-annotated genomic and transcriptomic data are available, the use of a nucleotide mapping reference represents a convenient technique that allows the utilisation of annotations detailed and updated on ncbi.

while the genoscope 8x predicted transcriptome contained  <dig>  sequences, the ncbi refseq dataset consisted of only  <dig>  sequences. given that a much higher proportion of our illumina sequencing reads mapped to the refseq dataset than to the genoscope dataset , it was considered unlikely that the difference of almost  <dig>  transcripts was simply a result of absent genes from the refseq mrna collection. a batch blast search using each of the genoscope predicted transcripts as a query against the refseq mrna dataset revealed that about  <dig>   of the  <dig>  genoscope transcripts had a hit in the refseq dataset with an e-value approaching zero . however, this included numerous duplicates where multiple short genoscope transcripts were matched to a single refseq transcript. when these duplicates were removed, a list of approximately  <dig>  accessions remained. furthermore, investigation of a subset of genoscope transcripts that had no blast hit within the refseq transcript collection revealed that many of these predicted transcripts were  <dig> nucleotides or less, and were probably partial gene sequences that did not have a significant match because of their length. we therefore propose that the widely used v. vinifera transcriptome prediction from genoscope contains multiple redundant accessions that have probably come about as a result of incorrect assignment of splice junctions. this analysis, combined with a higher proportion of mapped sequence reads, indicated that the manually curated ncbi refseq dataset is the most comprehensive and accurate collection of v. vinifera mrnas currently available, and we proceeded to use this set of reference transcripts to investigate mrna abundance and transcriptional regulation in grape berries.

transcript expression analysis
transcript abundance was determined by the calculation of reads per kilobase of exon per million mapped reads   <cit> . unique reads were counted to matching transcripts, and non-specifically mapped reads were allocated on a proportional basis relative to the number of unique reads already mapped. a limitation of this method is in the case of differentiating between recently duplicated isogenes with coding sequence exceeding 98% identity, and thus expression values in these instances should not be considered definitive. a method of measuring differences in expression between highly similar isogenes by microarray analysis of non-coding regions has been described for a subset of the v. vinifera genome  <cit> . the accuracy of the rpkm method for calculating transcript expression is also impacted in cases where full-length sequences are not transcribed due to premature stop codons, structural variation or differences between the mapping reference and the actual transcript. nevertheless, with these limitations in mind, out of the  <dig>  predicted transcripts in the ncbi refseq mrna collection,  <dig> - <dig>  transcripts could be detected at each developmental stage . for these data the lower limit for detection was designated to be an rpkm of  <dig> , or if the rpkm value was less than  <dig>  then a minimum of five uniquely matched reads  were required for a transcript to be considered present. only  <dig>  out of  <dig>  transcripts, approximately  <dig> %, did not meet these criteria for detection in any of the four developmental stages . to put the rpkm values from our study in perspective, a value of  <dig>  corresponds to an average transcript coverage of  <dig>  or about  <dig> bp of sequencing read coverage for a  <dig> bp transcript. in a recent comparable study, zenoni et al.  estimated that their statistical analysis would be reliable when applied to genes with  <dig> mapped 36- <dig> bp reads covering  <dig> bp of transcript, which could otherwise be expressed as average coverage of approximately one  <cit> . a benefit of mapping  <dig> bp reads compared with the shorter reads generated in the work of zenoni et al.  is the increased specificity, and thus accuracy, of transcript expression analysis. allowing for two mismatches, a  <dig> bp read maps with only 94% identity, inevitably leading to alignment with multiple locations, especially in the case of closely related multi-gene families. in the current study, approximately 85% of reads that were matched at 98% identity or greater were aligned to a single location in our reference dataset , compared with  <dig> % matched to unique locations by zenoni et al.   <cit> .

numbers of transcripts from the ncbi vitis vinifera refseq dataset detected at various levels of abundance at each time-point, as calculated by reads per kilobase of exon per million reads .

the fact that 70-80% of the ncbi refseq mrna transcripts for v. vinifera could be detected in each of our samples, and  <dig> % of transcripts could be detected in at least one sample, is a testament to the power of rna-seq analysis as a technique for transcriptional studies, compared with microarray analyses in which probes have historically covered a limited portion of the v. vinifera transcriptome. furthermore, the depth of our illumina sequencing data enabled us to investigate the expression of transcripts that are present at extremely variable absolute levels. for example, the lower limit for detection for which we report transcript regulation in this study, corresponding to an rpkm of  <dig>  , represents transcripts with an absolute abundance  <dig> -fold lower than the most abundant transcript in ripe berries, xm_ <dig> , which had an rpkm of  <dig> . the mrna xm_ <dig>  , which encodes an uncharacterised proline-rich protein of  <dig> amino acids, with sequence similarity to extensin related cell-wall proteins, accounted for an impressive  <dig> % of the sequencing reads generated from ripe berries. this highlights one of the benefits of rna-seq expression analysis over microarray analysis in uncovering transcripts that may be of interest. microarrays determine changes in the relative expression of transcripts between two or more samples, but do not provide accurate quantitative data on the absolute level of expression of a transcript within any given rna sample due to differences in probe binding specificity and efficiency. as a resource for grapevine researchers, we present the absolute expression levels of all transcripts in each of the four developmental stages investigated here in additional file 1: table s <dig>  alongside the closest matching genoscope accession and the functional annotation of the encoded protein.

global comparison with microarray analysis of developing grape
given the surfeit of literature reporting transcript expression in grapes based on the microarray platform, we investigated the correlation between our measurements of mrna transcript abundance based on rna-seq analysis and gene expression levels previously reported at equivalent developmental stages based on the affymetrix genechip. deluc et al.  investigated transcriptional regulation in developing grapes of vitis vinifera  at a number of developmental stages, including those corresponding to e-l  <dig>  e-l  <dig>  e-l  <dig> and e-l  <dig>  <cit> . although the varieties of grapes investigated by deluc et al.  differed from the variety studied in this report, we predicted that a majority of transcripts should exhibit similar relative abundances within each stage of berry development investigated here. for this comparison, we considered only genechip probesets for which the originating est has an exact blastn match  in the ncbi refseq dataset, and discarded probesets that cross-hybridised with multiple transcripts. transcripts that were expressed at low or background level in either microarray or rna-seq analysis were also removed, leaving  <dig> and  <dig> transcripts for cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay, respectively. for this subset of transcripts, the correlation between our rna-seq analysis and their expression in the corresponding developmental stages reported by deluc et al.  was approximately ρ =  <dig>  for cabernet sauvignon and ρ =  <dig>  for chardonnay . these relatively high correlation coefficients indicate that the absolute transcript expression levels we report within a single developmental stage of berry based on rna-seq give similar results to previous data generated by the affymetrix genechip microarray.

we also examined the correlation between the pattern of relative expression formed by the four developmental stages examined in our rna-seq analysis compared with the equivalent expression pattern as measured by microarray  <cit> . we found that the expression patterns of a majority of transcripts in both cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay were positively correlated with our shiraz rna-seq analysis. this included about 30% of transcripts for which the patterns of expression measured by the two platforms were extremely highly correlated with a ρ ≥  <dig>  . the majority of transcript expression patterns were positively correlated to some degree, with about 57% of transcripts exhibiting a medium to high correlation of ρ ≥  <dig> . the high correlation between differential expression of transcripts reported here and the expression patterns previously measured by microarray, goes some way towards validating the utility of our data for investigating transcriptional regulation during grape development.

highly expressed transcripts throughout grape development
approximately 400- <dig> transcripts from each developmental stage had an rpkm value of  <dig> or greater , and as such represented the top  <dig> - <dig> % of mrnas by absolute expression level. of these transcripts,  <dig> had an rpkm of over  <dig> in all four samples under investigation . in addition to  <dig> uncharacterised proteins, the products of these highly expressed transcripts included a number of proteins that would generally be expected to be highly expressed in most cell types. these included  <dig> ribosomal proteins,  <dig> translation initiation and elongation factors,  <dig> proteins involved in amino acid metabolism,  <dig> glycolysis pathway enzymes,  <dig> catalase isoforms,  <dig> actin-related proteins,  <dig> vacuolar proton atpases, super-oxide dismutase and rubisco. it is interesting to note that  <dig> out of  <dig> of these highly expressed transcripts have a matching affymetrix probeset id, despite the fact that only 34% of the refseq sequences are represented on the microarray. this is likely due to the fact that the design of microarray probesets was based predominantly on est data, in which highly expressed transcripts are inherently over-represented. conversely, of the  <dig>  transcripts that were not detected in any of our four samples, only  <dig>  are represented by an affymetrix probe .

given the apparent constitutively high level of transcription for the genes mentioned above, it could be suggested that they are likely to play an important role in biological processes occurring during berry development. however, since we have not investigated other tissue from grapevine in this study, we do not present evidence that the transcripts are specifically involved in berry development relative to other grapevine tissues. nevertheless, some potential berry-related genes can be seen within this list. since high levels of malic acid are synthesized in berries until veraison, and both the concentration and absolute level rapidly decrease after veraison  <cit> , it is not surprising that a cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase , which catalyses the reversible conversion of oxaloacetate to malate, was highly abundant at all stages. another functionally annotated cytoplasmic mdh enzyme  was similarly abundant, while the third isoform  was approximately 50-fold less abundant. immediately adjacent to mdh in the citric acid cycle, citrate synthase  was also one of the consistently abundant transcripts in our data. given that malate accumulates in the berry vacuole where it is compartmentally separated from the citric acid cycle enzymes, the highly abundant putative malate carrier protein  may warrant further functional investigation.

another abundant, putatively berry-specific gene was a chalcone synthase isoform , which is a potential upstream regulator of a number of phenolic secondary metabolites, including tannins, anthocyanins and flavonols. in contrast, chs <dig> has previously been shown to be developmentally regulated with highest expression occurring in young berries  <cit> , a result that is consistent with our rna-seq analysis . the finding that two genes putatively involved in the metabolism of alpha-linolenic acid  were highly abundant is interesting since n- <dig> fatty acids such as linolenic have only been found to be present in grapes at extremely low concentrations  <cit> . thus, the high expression level of these two transcripts in grapes suggests further characterisation may be required to determine their true functional activity. one isoform of hydroxymethylgutaryl-coa synthase  was highly abundant, while the other  was not detected in any of our samples, highlighting the importance of isoform-specific expression data.

specifically up-regulated transcripts
we used our quantitative expression analysis to investigate genes that are transcriptionally regulated during specific stages of berry development. first, we investigated genes that were more highly expressed in a single developmental stage when compared with their expression levels in each of the other three stages. to account for low and zero values in our data while still identifying biologically significant changes, differences were calculated relative to an rpkm of  <dig>  when calculating fold changes from rpkm values of less than  <dig> . thus, the difference between  <dig>  and  <dig>  was considered a 10-fold or greater increase, but not a 50-fold increase. this went some way towards discarding unrealistically high expression changes that are an unavoidable consequence of data that incorporates values approaching and including zero. in total, there were  <dig>  transcripts that exhibited 3-fold or greater increased expression at a single developmental stage compared with all other stages . a relatively low number of these transcripts were specifically up-regulated at early- or late-veraison . the low number of genes specifically regulated at these time points is probably due to the fact that only a single week separated the two samples. furthermore, in order to capture a representative biological selection of transcripts at each time-point, rna for illumina sequencing was purified from tissue consisting of  <dig> berries collected from  <dig> bunches that had been monitored from the beginning of the growing season and tagged at 50% cap-fall . since it takes approximately one week for a single bunch to develop from 0% to 100% cap-fall, it could be argued that individual grapes on any given bunch are separated by up to a week in their absolute developmental age. this biological variation within each of our early- and late- veraison stages could have masked transcriptional regulation events that take place over the relatively short one-week period during which pigmentation occurs . also, it has been reported that major changes in gene expression can occur over as little as  <dig> hours, and that this happens before changes in ph, sugars and berry colouring can be observed  <cit> . therefore, an in-depth analysis of genes that are differentially expressed between young berries and veraison, and between veraison and full-ripening, could yield more useful information about global changes in metabolism. with this in mind, we also generated data on the number of transcripts that are specifically up-regulated at both the time-points taken around veraison , compared with their expression level in young or ripe berries . a complete list of all  <dig>  transcripts that are specifically up-regulated 3-fold or more at a single developmental stage corresponding to the transcripts counted in table  <dig>  and an additional  <dig> transcripts that are specifically over-expressed during both early- and late-veraison, is provided in additional file  <dig> 

the numbers of transcripts significantly up-regulated in berries at a single developmental stage relative to all other samples. fold changes are calculated compared with a minimum rpkm value of  <dig> . given the similarity in transcript expression patterns between early and late-veraison , the relative expression of transcripts in both of these stages compared with e-l  <dig> and e-l  <dig> are reported in the separated column “veraison”.

given the observed similarity between rpkm data from early- and late-veraison samples, we investigated the overall correlation between these two stages in order to estimate the technical variation within our experiment. the pearson’s correlation coefficient for global transcript expression between these two stages  was ρ =  <dig> , which is equivalent to the correlation expected for high quality technical replicates of the same rna sample  <cit> . additionally, only about 2% of genes exhibited a log <dig> transcript abundance difference of greater than  <dig>   between these stages , which could be explained as a conservative description of the transcripts truly differentially expressed between early- and late-veraison. thus, although it will be desirable to analyse global transcript abundance from more highly separated time-points around veraison when investigating developmental regulation in future studies, we were able to use these two samples as de facto replicates in order to demonstrate that our rpkm expression data was reproducible and that 3-fold and greater changes in abundance were very unlikely to be the result of technical variation.

one of the clearest findings from an analysis of transcripts that were highly over-expressed at a single stage was the large number of biological processes activated in young berries  that do not occur during veraison or in ripe berries. in young berries,  <dig>  of the  <dig>  investigated transcripts were specifically overexpressed relative to all other time-points, while  <dig>  were specifically up-regulated in ripe berries . the  <dig>  transcripts that were at least 3-fold up-regulated in immature berries represented a significant 12% of the total grapevine predicted transcriptome, or approximately 15% of the transcripts expressed in berries. a portion of these genes were extremely highly up-regulated with  <dig> transcripts up-regulated over 50-fold in young berries compared with expression levels in any other sample. many of the transcripts more highly expressed in young berries can be linked with the photosynthetic capacity of grapes during early stages of development, which decreases dramatically during ripening  <cit> . for example,  <dig> of the  <dig> annotated chlorophyll a-b binding proteins from grapevine were amongst these  <dig>  transcripts, as were  <dig> out of  <dig> photosystem i reaction center subunit-encoding transcripts, two of the three transcripts encoding the photosystem ii reaction center w and transcripts for photosystem ii 5kda and 22kda core-complex proteins . transcripts encoding enzymes from other metabolic pathways reported to occur early in grape berry development were also highly over represented in the list, such as genes involved in the biosynthesis of tannin precursors. these include anthocyanidin reductase, leucanthocyanidin reductase, and five anthocyanidin 3-o-glucosyltransferases, which stabilise anthocyanins through glycosylation  <cit> .

transcription factors are of particular interest given their ability to control the expression of numerous genes, and thus their ability to regulate biological pathways and developmental processes. there were  <dig> annotated transcription factors specifically over-expressed 50-fold or greater in young berries, most of which had zero or negligible expression at the other stages investigated here . these included nine transcripts encoding ethylene-responsive transcription factor  5-like proteins. we found that a further four erf5-like transcripts were specifically up-regulated between 10- and 50-fold in young berries . combined, these transcripts comprised  <dig> of the  <dig> annotated erf5-like genes, while the remaining four erf5-like transcripts were all up-regulated 2- to 3-fold in young berries. six other transcription factors that were 50-fold or greater up-regulated in young berries are annotated as ethylene-responsive transcription factors, including two erf17s, erf <dig>  erf <dig>  erf <dig> and erf-win <dig> . whether these families of transcription factors are responsive to ethylene in grapes has not been established, and it is important to remember that the majority of functional annotations are made based on sequence similarity to proteins from other species, predominantly arabidopsis. indeed, while ethylene signalling is known to play an important role in the ripening of climacteric fruit, the precise role of ethylene signalling, if any, in grape development remains an active area of research  <cit> . nevertheless, the high degree of transcriptional specificity of these families of transcription factors is a strong indication that they are responsible for regulating biological processes that occur early during grape berry development.


transcriptions factors that are up-regulated 50-fold or greater in e-l  <dig> berries, and 3-fold or greater in e-l 35- <dig> berries or e-l  <dig> berries. the rpkm values indicating specific up-regulation are shown in bold. expression values are shown in rpkm for each sample, and fold-changes were calculated relative to a minimum value of  <dig> . matching genoscope and probeset ids are shown if applicable and the putative function of encoded proteins are described by their ncbi annotation. a complete list of all differentially regulated transcripts is presented in additional file  <dig> 

while all of the transcription factors that were 50-fold or greater specifically up-regulated in a single sample were found in young berries, four transcription factors were specifically over-expressed at least 3-fold during veraison, and  <dig> were specifically over expressed at least 3-fold in ripe berries . one veraison-specific transcription factor is of particular interest due to its similarity to, and thus functional annotation as, an upbeat <dig> gene. the upbeat <dig> transcription factor has been shown to control the transition from cell proliferation to cell differentiation in arabidopsis roots by modifying the balance of reactive oxygen species  <cit> . in grapes, an oxidative burst has been observed during veraison and is accompanied by the modulation of numerous of ros scavenging enzymes, including peroxidases, peroxiredoxins, thioredoxins and glutathione-s-transferases  <cit> . since many of the transcripts for these enzymes were shown to increase at veraison, the v. vinifera upbeat1-like transcription factor, xm_ <dig> , could be a potential target for further investigation. in ripe berries, the wrky family of transcription factors was the most over represented, with  <dig> out of  <dig> putative members in grapevine specifically expressed in this sample. wrky-type transcription factors have previously been implicated in pathogen response pathways in grapes  <cit> , and given that berries are most likely to suffer from fungal attack during late ripening stages, the highly regulated expression patterns reported here could be a further indication that some wrky-type transcription factors are activated in response to biotic stress. six members of the ethylene-responsive transcription factor family were also up-regulated in ripe berries, although only the erf <dig> sub-family was represented by more than a single transcript .

an overview of gene ontology enrichment during berry development
in addition to describing transcripts that were highly up-regulated at a single developmental stage, transcripts that exhibited differential expression between a number of time points were investigated using statistical clustering. this technique revealed transcripts from the pool of differentially regulated genes that exhibited similar patterns of expression over the four developmental stages investigated here, regardless of the absolute level of expression. we present  <dig> clusters of developmentally regulated genes comprising  <dig>  transcripts that displayed some degree of differential expression . in agreement with our finding that a large number of transcripts were specifically over expressed in young berries, two of the largest clusters contained transcripts up-regulated in the first developmental stage. cluster  <dig> contained  <dig>  transcripts that were highly specific to young berries, while cluster  <dig> contained  <dig>  transcripts that were most highly abundant in young berries and exhibited decreasing abundance in later stages. cluster  <dig>  also contained genes that were most abundant in young berries and decreased through to harvest, and cluster  <dig>  contained genes that were up-regulated in young and ripe berries, but were less abundant around veraison. the majority of the transcripts reported as specifically up-regulated in young berries based on 3-fold or greater rpkm changes  fell within clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  also consistent with our analysis of stage specific up-regulation presented in table  <dig>  only  <dig> and  <dig> transcripts were specifically up-regulated at either early- or late-veraison, respectively , while  <dig> transcripts were up-regulated at both veraison stages . cluster  <dig> consisted of  <dig>  transcripts that were strongly up-regulated in ripe berries, while cluster  <dig>  and cluster  <dig>  contained genes for which expression increased throughout development and peaked in ripe berries.

in order to produce a global description of biological processes enriched in each cluster of similarly regulated transcripts, we generated an overview of gene ontology  terms using agrigo  <cit> . the agrigo go analysis tool retrieved descriptions of gene function based on the standardised vocabulary of the gene ontology bioinformatics initiative  <cit> . we then used the recently-created revigo web server to summarise these long lists of go terms by removing redundant terms and grouping related terms based on semantic similarity  <cit> . because go terms have been assigned using blast, pfam and interpro scans, individual annotations should be viewed with caution. nevertheless, for large groups of genes, statistically enriched terms can give insights into biological pathways that are likely to be highly active by comparing them to the frequency at which those go terms appear in the whole transcriptome. a number of enriched ontological terms were reported several times amongst our clustered transcripts that relate to biological processes which could be expected to be enriched in developing fruit. for example, transcripts annotated with the go terms “cellular reproductive process” and “post-embryonic development” were found to be enriched in six and five separate gene clusters, respectively . given that statistical enrichment is calculated in comparison to the whole transcriptome, it is not surprising that go terms relating to embryo development and reproduction were consistently enriched in berries in general. a more specifically enriched subset of go terms were those relating to photosynthesis. these were enriched in cluster  <dig> only, which included transcripts that were highly upregulated in young green berries compered to berries at veraison and harvest, and is in agreement with our initial observation that many transcripts involved in photosynthesis were specifically expressed at this stage. similarly, go terms relating to thylakoid membrane localisation were enriched in cluster  <dig>  which consisted of genes that had decreasing abundances throughout development. these results confirm that the gene ontology enrichment detailed here describes biologically relevant metabolic events occurring at different stages of berry development.

an analysis of cluster  <dig> indicates that secondary metabolic pathways in general were highly up-regulated in ripe berries, as was the biosynthesis of modified amino acids, aromatic compounds, and phenylpropanoids . the most statistically significant enrichment within our cluster analysis was of transcripts involved in responding to hormone signalling, which were highly enriched in cluster  <dig>  this could suggest that overall, hormone-controlled metabolic pathways are most likely to be activated in the early stages of grape development. additionally, since terms relating to ribosome biogenesis, nucleosome assembly and translational elongation are enriched in clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  it appears that berries were more translationally active during early development than they were later in the season. this could be explained by the high rate of cell division and differentiation occurring in the weeks following flowering, which later decreases as berry growth increasingly comes about through cell expansion and vacuolar enlargement  <cit> . the go term “response to heat” was significantly enriched in cluster  <dig> . an in-depth analysis of transcripts located in this cluster revealed that  <dig> heat shock proteins were present, comprising approximately 13% of the genes in cluster  <dig>  and representing more than one third of all annotated heat shock proteins in v. vinifera . we subsequently found that the minimum temperature on the morning of grape collection at late-veraison was  <dig> °c, compared with  <dig> - <dig> °c on other days of collection and also that the maximum temperature on the day prior to sample collection was the highest of the growing season at  <dig> °c . given the well-characterised role of a number of heat shock proteins in response to environmental stimuli such as heat, water stress and oxidative stress  <cit> , this is most likely an example of highly coordinated transcript regulation in response to environmental stimulus, rather than an example of developmental regulation.

a method that has been used previously for the ontological description of grapevine genes is go-slim, which utilises a simplified subset of go terms to give a broad overview of ontological content, but assigns many transcripts into vague categories such as “cellular process” or “other biological process”  <cit> . the descriptive summaries of go term enrichment generated here using the agrigo and revigo web tools represent a significant advance over previous techniques for ontological description of gene clusters. however, since our analysis of differential transcript expression has been carried out on samples from a specific vineyard over a single growing season, it cannot be inferred that the patterns of transcript expression, and therefore of metabolic pathway activation, are definitively linked with developmental changes. while it is likely that developmentally regulated transcripts have been identified, it is also possible that specific environmental, biotic or abiotic conditions that existed at the time of sampling have played a part in differential transcript regulation. nevertheless, the differential regulation of transcripts in selected metabolic pathways that was observed during this season will be discussed below, and our full rpkm-based transcript abundance and cluster analyses are detailed in additional file  <dig> 

organic acid metabolism
the berry metabolism of organic acids including malate, tartrate and ascorbate is an area of active research because of their contribution to juice and wine acidity and to the organoleptic characteristics and ageing potential of wine  <cit> . additionally, the malate concentration of harvested berries can affect malolactic acid fermentation and influence the growth of malolactic bacteria  <cit> . despite the clear developmentally regulated pattern of malate accumulation and degradation , the majority of genes encoding enzymes directly involved in malate metabolism, including malate dehydrogenase  and nad-dependant malic enzyme, were expressed at all four stages of development investigated, with little differential regulation. two exceptions to this were isoforms of cytoplasmic mdh  and mitochondrial malic enzyme , which were allocated to cluster  <dig> and thus decreased through berry development, although transcript abundance remained relatively high . since these two enzymes are involved in malate biosynthesis from oxaloacetate or pyruvate, respectively, their decreasing expression could be reflected in the observed physiological decrease in malate. the constitutive expression of other mdh and malic enzyme isoforms is likely due to the involvement of malic acid in numerous facets of plant primary metabolism, including the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the glyoxylate pathway  <cit> . in contrast to malate biosynthesis genes, all three transcripts encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinases  were allocated to cluster  <dig> , and two transcripts encoding pep carboxylases  were in cluster  <dig> . pepck enzymes catalyse the conversion of oxaloacetate to pep, while pepc carries out the reverse reaction. thus, since mdh enzymes catalyse the reversible interconversion of oxaloacetate and malate, the potential decrease in oxaloacetate in mature berries caused by altered expression of pepc and pepck could influence malate degradation by shifting the function of mdh enzymes towards malate catabolism. one isoform each of pepck  and pepc  were included in the qrt-pcr validation of our rna-seq analysis, and it was shown that the expression differences observed between the four developmental stages were consistent across three biological replicates . since the catabolism of malate can only occur when the acid is accessible to metabolic enzymes outside the vacuole, the compartmentation of malate may also influence rates of its accumulation and degradation during berry development. tonoplast dicarboxylate transporters  have been shown to be responsible for the active transport of malate into plant vacuoles  <cit> , and their genomic disruption in arabidopsis led to decreased malate accumulation  <cit> . the two transcripts encoding tdts in grapevine  were allocated to cluster  <dig>  and decreased 20-fold between veraison and harvest, and the expression pattern of the latter was confirmed by qrt-pcr . a decrease in malate transport into the vacuole between veraison and harvest, combined with the action of cytoplasmic mdh and pepck in malate catabolism, could explain the developmental pattern of malate accumulation and degradation observed in v. vinifera.

ascorbate is the main soluble antioxidant in plants and is predominantly synthesised in green tissues by the well-characterised smirnoff-wheeler pathway, in which the direct ascorbate precursor l-galactono- <dig> -lactone is produced from gdp-l-mannose by the sequential action of gdp-mannose- <dig> -epimerase , gdp-l-galactose phosphorylase , l-galactose-1-phosphate phosphatase and l-galactose dehydrogenase   <cit> . a more recently proposed alternative pathway for ascorbate biosynthesis involves the production of l-galactono- <dig> -lactone from d-galacturonic acid by the enzyme galacturonic acid reductase   <cit> . in a final step, l-galactono- <dig> -lactone is converted to ascorbate by l-galactono- <dig> -lactone dehydrogenase . as a central component of redox metabolism in plants, ascorbate exists in equilibrium with its oxidised form dehydroascorbate, which can be catabolised to oxalate and l-threonate as well as being recycled to ascorbate. the ascorbate catabolic pathway that is of most interest to grape researchers, however, is its conversion into tartrate via an l-idonate intermediate; a pathway in which only one enzyme, l-idonate dehydrogenase , has been biochemically characterised  <cit> . in our data, three isoforms of gme  were allocated to clusters  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  indicating that they were specifically expressed in young berries, or were most abundant in young berries and then decreased during ripening . similarly, the single isoform of l-galdh  and the most abundant isoform of vtc <dig>  were allocated to cluster  <dig>  also, although gldh  was not differentially expressed enough to be allocated a cluster in our analysis, its abundance did decrease during development and was 3-fold lower in ripe berries than in immature berries . given that both ascorbate and tartrate levels have been shown to increase in grape berries most rapidly from about two weeks after flowering until veraison  <cit> , our data suggests that this is potentially controlled transcriptionally through differential expression of components of the smirnoff-wheeler pathway. comparable results were obtained for genes of this pathway investigated with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and reported by melino et al. . the transcript most similar to the characterised galur from strawberry  was detected at very low levels in young berries, and not at all in the other samples. however, several other transcripts encoding putative oxidoreductases that are also homologues of galur were expressed at much higher levels, including xm_ <dig> , which was allocated to cluster  <dig> . two of the three potential l-idndh isoforms were specific to young berries and located in cluster  <dig>  while a third isoform  was in cluster  <dig>  suggesting that the biosynthesis of tartrate from ascorbate may be controlled at different stages of grape development by different genes . the transcript expression levels for two l-idndh isofroms, xm_ <dig>  and xm_ <dig> , were validated by qrt-pcr, and demonstrated that the patterns were consistent across three replicates from different vines .

co-regulation of phenylpropanoid/stilbene biosynthetic genes
a grape secondary metabolite that has received a great deal of attention in recent times is the polyphenolic compound resveratrol . resveratrol is a phytoalexin involved in pathogen defence in grapevine  <cit> , although it has also been shown to be present in healthy grapes  <cit> . resveratrol is found in red wine and can positively regulate a number of beneficial physiological processes in animals  <cit> . the resveratrol biosynthesis pathway consists of four enzymes that sequentially transform phenylalanine into this specialised secondary metabolite. the first three enzymes, phenylalanine ammonia lyase , cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase  and 4-coumarate:coa ligase , are components of the common phenylpropanoid pathway, which also leads to the production of phenolic compounds such as lignins, anthocyanins and other flavonoids. the fourth enzyme, stilbene synthase , exists only in plants that produce stilbenes, and can catalyse the final step by converting 4-coumaroyl-coa and three molecules of malonyl-coa into cis- or trans-resveratrol. although this biosynthetic pathway is commonly described as comprising four single enzymes, each are encoded by multi-gene families, which have potentially redundant activities, and may have different temporal or spatial expression. the ncbi annotation of proteins encoded by the refseq mrna transcripts suggests that there are  <dig> pals,  <dig> c4hs,  <dig> 4cls and a startling  <dig> stss. despite the fact that less than 35% of the refseq mrnas were differentially expressed enough to be included in our cluster analysis, almost all the transcripts in the stilbene biosynthesis pathway were assigned to a cluster. this confirms the well-reported observation that both general phenylpropanoid metabolism and specialised resveratrol metabolism are highly regulated processes in grapes. the majority of pal, c4h and sts transcripts were grouped in cluster  <dig>  indicating they were specifically up-regulated in ripe berries. in contrast, the 4cl transcripts exhibited more varied expression patterns, including three transcripts in cluster  <dig> , two in cluster  <dig>  and one each in clusters  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> . a pal transcript has previously been reported to be up-regulated early in the season under water-deficit, as measured by the intensity of the genechip probeset 1613113_at   <cit> . this particular transcript was the only one of  <dig> putative grapevine pal genes which was not assigned a cluster in our analysis, and therefore the specific co-regulation of the majority of pal genes in ripe berries that we saw in our data was not observed in that study. guillaumie et al.  reported that two pal isoforms, corresponding to xm_ <dig> and xm_ <dig>  increased in abundance over the final week of ripening, which is consistent with our results for these transcripts  <cit> . the first three steps of the phenylpropanoid pathway provide 4-coumaroyl coa as a substrate for chalcone synthase , which produces chalcone as the precursor for the important organoleptic flavonoids and anthocyanins. while seven potential chs transcripts are annotated in the refseq mrna collection, three of these were not detected in our data and may represent v. vinifera genes expressed in tissue other than grape. two of the four detectable chs transcripts were grouped in cluster  <dig> , one was in cluster  <dig> , and one was not differentially regulated .


clustering of genes involved in phenylpropanoid metabolism and stilbene biosynthesis. nc, expressed but not clustered; nd, not detected; a transcripts with the highest sequence similarity to the functionally characterised resveratrol synthase, vst <dig>  <cit> ; b transcripts with the highest sequence similarity to the functionally characterised resveratrol synthase, stsy  <cit> .

several v. vinifera stss have been shown biochemically to be involved in resveratrol biosynthesis  <cit> , however the high sequence similarity amongst this multi-gene family  suggests they may all carry out a similar, or identical, biochemical reaction. thus, an accurate description of the expression of each isoform is required for a full understanding of the conditions and tissue in which resveratrol is likely to be produced. our data indicated that  <dig> of the  <dig> stss were co-regulated in cluster  <dig>  one was not detected, and one was in cluster  <dig>  which also consisted of genes most highly expressed at harvest . a high proportion of reads mapped to each refseq sts transcript were unique, even when rpkm counting was performed at 99% , suggesting that the strong co-regulation of this gene family was not an artefact of the read mapping process. eight stss are represented by probesets on the genechip microarray platform, and deluc et al.  demonstrated that each of these was up-regulated to some degree late in the growing season, with highest expression from five weeks after veraison until harvest  <cit> . they also demonstrated that this up-regulation was increased in water deficit conditions, so it is possible that the environmental conditions during the season under investigation here could have contributed to, or been the cause of, the highly coordinated up-regulation of stss in ripe berries. a more recent investigation into stilbene synthase expression during grape ripening with the latest and most comprehensive microarray platform showed low expression of stss in all stages of berry development until post-harvest  <cit> , suggesting that the precise timing of berry harvest could be a vital determinant in stilbene, and thus resveratrol, content in wine. we investigated the expression levels to two stss across our four developmental stages via quantitative rt-pcr, including the single sts that was located in cluster  <dig> , and one of the stss located in cluster  <dig> due to its specific expression in ripe berries . this pcr-based method validated the result observed from our rna-seq data, and demonstrated that the results were consistent amongst the three biological replicates analysed .

differential expression of aroma-related transcripts
aroma is an important determinant of wine quality, and the precursors of many aroma compounds found in wine are synthesised during berry development. compounds from the terpenoid class of biochemicals have been shown to influence the aroma of wine, with several 10-carbon monoterpenes affecting the fruity character of wine  <cit> , and a 15-carbon sesquiterpenoid being responsible for the peppery aroma of shiraz  <cit> . monoterpenes are formed through the action of terpene synthase-a  enzymes that use geranyl pyrophosphate as a substrate, arising from products of the deoxy xylulose-5-phosphate  pathway, isopentenyl pyrophosphate  and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate . the dxp pathway consists of seven chloroplast-localised enzymes  <cit> , for which six of the encoding transcripts were expressed at all four stages of berry development with little differential regulation. the transcript encoding the final enzyme of the dxp pathway, hydroxymethylbutenyl diphosphate reductase  was in cluster  <dig> and therefore up-regulated at veraison and in ripe berries . although transcripts encoding components of the dxp pathway were expressed during berry development, we detected almost no expression of putative monoterpene synthases. similar to the number of putative tps-a genes identified by martin et al.   <cit> ,  <dig> potential monoterpene synthases were found in the refseq mrna collection, all of which were annotated by sequence similarity as myrcene or linalool synthases. of these  <dig> transcripts,  <dig> were not detected in any of the four developing grape samples investigated here. the other three were detected at relatively low transcript abundances , with one each in clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  and one expressed in the first two stages but not assigned to a cluster . the specific expression of xm_ <dig>  in immature green berries when compared with berries at veraison or harvest was confirmed by quantitative rt-pcr . given the high transcriptome coverage observed in each sample and therefore our ability to detect transcript expression at extremely low levels, this is a strong indication that tps-a enzymes do not play an important metabolic role for v. vinifera  during ripening. in contrast to the absence of expression of monoterpene synthases in ripening shiraz berries, the expression of a linalool/nerolidol synthase was recently found to be highest during veraison in the gewürztraminer grape variety  <cit> . additionally, although significant levels of monoterpenes such as geraniol, linalool and α-terpineol are found in muscat grapes  <cit>  and to a lesser extent in gewürztraminer and riesling varieties  <cit> , they have not been found at significant levels in red grape varieties. the low level of expression of three putative monoterpene synthases in the earliest shiraz berry sample  could be a reflection of transcriptional events that were up-regulated during flowering, when monoterpene synthases have been shown to be transcribed  <cit> . in the absence of monoterpene synthase expression in ripening berries, the presence of transcripts encoding the dxp pathway can be explained by the potential utilisation of ipp and dmapp for the biosynthesis of other terpene-based metabolites such as carotenoids and phytosterols.


sesquiterpenes are produced by members of the tps-b enzyme family from farnesyl pyrophosphate , which is formed in the cytoplasm from ipp and dmapp. cytoplasmic ipp and dmapp are produced by the mevalonate pathway, consisting of six enzymes for which transcripts were found in each of the four developmental stages. from the mevalonate pathway, two of the three transcripts encoding isoforms of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme a reductase  were in cluster  <dig> , as was fpp synthase, while all other transcripts were unclustered. hmgr is considered to be the rate limiting enzyme in the mevalonate pathway  <cit> , and thus its up-regulation early in development could indicate a greater requirement for terpene precursors in immature berries. we identified  <dig> transcripts encoding putative tps-b enzymes, which are currently annotated by ncbi as valencene synthase-like or germacrene synthase-like genes. the differential regulation of tps-a and tps-b transcripts in grapes has not previously been reported in detail in microarray experiments due to poor coverage of the tps gene family by the available probes. for example, on the affymetrix genechip there is only a single probe that interrogates a tps-a transcript and four probes that interrogate tps-b transcripts . in our analysis, however,  <dig> of the  <dig> tps-b transcripts were detected in at least one sample, and all  <dig> exhibited differential expression during grape development . three transcripts were in cluster  <dig>  and were therefore specifically expressed in young berries , two were specifically expressed around veraison and allocated to clusters  <dig> and  <dig> , and five transcripts were in cluster  <dig> and up-regulated in ripe berries . remarkably, all of these transcripts except xm_ <dig>  were predominantly expressed in only one of the four samples, demonstrating the existence of tightly controlled differential regulation. given the importance of some sesquiterpenoids for the aroma of wine , members of the tps-b clade of terpene synthases for which transcripts are up-regulated in ripening berries may be interesting future targets for functional characterisation. we validated the observed differential expression for two transcripts from cluster  <dig> and two from cluster  <dig> using qrt-pcr. for three of these transcripts, we confirmed that the extremely specific temporal expression was consistent amongst three biological samples, while in the case of transcript xm_ <dig> , it was relatively highly expressed at the late-veraison stage as well as ripe berries, in one of the three biological replicates .

another class of potential aroma compounds that stem from terpene metabolic pathways are the c <dig> norisoprenoids, such as β-damascenone and ionone, which are derived as breakdown products of c <dig> carotenoids  <cit> . the breakdown of carotenoids into norisoprenoids is thought to be catalysed by carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase  enzymes, one of which has been functionally characterised in grapes   <cit> . the transcript encoding vvccd <dig>  xm_ <dig> , was grouped in cluster  <dig>  and was highly abundant  from early-veraison through ripening, while a close homologue xm_ <dig>  was expressed at much lower level but followed a similar expression pattern . transcripts encoding two other putative ccds were detected in our samples, including xm_ <dig> , which was also grouped in cluster  <dig>  and xm_ <dig> , which was in cluster  <dig> and highly up-regulated in ripe berries. this last observation is in agreement with a recent microarray study by guillaumie et al. , who reported that xm_ <dig>  expression increased approximately 2-fold in the final week of ripening  <cit> . our data therefore provides an indication that the production of c <dig> norisoprenoids by the ccd-catalysed enzymatic cleavage of carotenoids is initiated at veraison and continues through until harvest, and could explain the physiological observation that β-damascenone accumulates after veraison  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
rna-seq analysis of transcript abundances during berry development has enabled us to carry out a global investigation of gene expression at four time-points in developing grapes and has facilitated a comprehensive description of differential transcriptional events that occurred within a single season for the important wine grape variety v. vinifera . we have reported a detailed description of the expression profiles of  <dig>  mrna transcripts contained within the ncbi refseq v. vinifera collection, and shown that this is an accurate reference for transcript abundance measurements. we used gene clustering and the enrichment of gene ontology terms to describe the overall biological processes that were regulated during development, and described the transcriptional patterns of genes involved in organic acid, stilbene and terpenoid metabolism as examples of co-regulated and differentially expressed gene families. quantitative real-time pcr was used to confirm the differential expression patterns observed for  <dig> of the genes reported, and it was demonstrated that the results obtained with rna-seq were consistent with the average expression from three biological replicates. whether the differential regulation of gene expression described here occurred solely as a consequence of berry development, or in response to specific environmental, biotic or abiotic conditions requires further confirmation during other seasons and in different locations. also, the extent to which the differential regulation of genes reported here is applicable to other v. vinifera varieties is yet to be shown, and the investigation of transcriptional changes at more closely spaced developmental stages will provide further valuable information. our full transcript abundance analysis, presented in additional file  <dig>  represents an invaluable resource for hypothesis development and candidate gene selection.
