BACKGROUND
xyelydidae is an extinct family known from compression fossils ranging in age from the later early  jurassic to early cretaceous. this family, considered to be the most primitive of the pamphilioidea, plays an important role as an ancestral group in the evolution of the superfamily  <cit> . there are currently  <dig> species in seven genera recognized within this family  <cit> , which are summarized in table  <dig> 

very few xyelydidae fossils have been reported from china and only three species have been described from the jiulongshan formation of daohugou, inner mongolia, china  <cit> : ferganolyda rasnitsyn,  <dig>  f. scylla rasnitsyn, zhang & wang, 2006; f. charybdis rasnitsyn, zhang & wang, 2006; and f. chungkuei rasnitsyn, zhang & wang,  <dig>  in addition, one species from the yixian formation of huangbanjigou, liaoning, china has been described: novalyda cretacica gao, engel, shih & ren,  <dig>  novalyda cretacica is the only record reported from the early cretaceous, representing the youngest record of this family to date  <cit> .

in this study, we describe rectilyda sticta gen. et sp. nov. from the yixian formation of nanyingpan village, the sandaogou township, duolun county, inner mongolia, china. based on a unique combination of primitive and more derived characters of this sawfly, we present a new genus and assign it to the family xyelydidae. this insect fauna lived about  <dig> mya, and belonged to the famous jehol biota of the early cretaceous  <cit> . according to a survey of the cnub insect fossil collection, duolun has yielded many insect fossils, including bugs  <cit> , basal fleas  <cit> , and rare specimens of sawflies. the only sawfly that has been described so far is hoplitolyda duolunica gao, shih, rasnitsyn & ren,  <dig>  which belongs to praesiricidae of the superfamily pamphilioidea. it represents the largest fossil hymenopteran to date, with an estimated body length of  <dig>  mm and wing span of  <dig>  mm  <cit> . rectilyda sticta gen. et sp. nov. is, therefore, the second sawfly described from the duolun locality.

methods
the specimen was examined and then photographed, either dry or wetted with 95% ethanol, using a leica mz  <dig>  dissecting microscope  with a leica dfc <dig> digital camera attached. the line drawings were prepared using adobe illustrator cs <dig> and adobe photoshop cs <dig> software. the wing venation nomenclature used in this article was modified after rasnitsyn  <cit> . the type material described is deposited in the key lab of insect evolution and environmental changes, college of life sciences, capital normal university, in beijing, china .

no specific permits were required for collection of the insect fossils, including the materials from nanyingpan village, sandaogou township, duolun county, inner mongolia, china.

RESULTS
description of the specimens
hymenoptera linnaeus,  <dig> 

pamphilioidea cameron,  <dig> 

xyelydidae rasnitsyn,  <dig> 

rectilyda wang, rasnitsyn, shih & ren, gen. nov.

etymology
the generic name is a combination of the latin “rect-”, meaning straight , and lyda, a junior synonym of pamphilius latreille,  <dig>  often used as a suffix for generic names in pamphilioidea. gender feminine.

diagnosis
antenna with about  <dig> segments; the third antennal segment shorter than remaining segments combined; flagellomeres nearly as long as wide, becoming narrower and shorter towards the apex. mandibles strong, with at least one small inner tooth. forewing with sc bifurcate; pterostigma narrow and long, sclerotized completely; 1-rs reclival, as long as 1-m and linearly aligned with 1-m; 1-m nearly equal to 2-m in length; cell 3r at least  <dig>  times as long as cells 1r and 2r. hind wing with sc <dig> and sc <dig> present; crossvein m-cu distal to middle of cell rm; cu-a before middle of cell mcu.

remarks
we assign rectilyda gen. nov. to xyelydidae mainly based on three primitive characters. this recognition is by necessity, as the family is paraphyletic and reclassification into one or several monophyletic parts is complicated under the current state of knowledge  <cit> . the primitive characters are: 1) sc bifurcate in the forewing; 2) m + cu smoothly bent; 3) cell 1mcu relatively large and 1cu-a located distad middle of cell 1mcu. rectilyda differs from other members of xyelydidae in having 1-rs aligned with, and as long as, 1-m and the third antennal segment shorter than remaining segments combined. other xyelydids always have 1-rs proclival, distinctly angled with 1-m and much shorter than 1-m; 1-rs is rarely subequal to 1-m, and the third antennal segment is relatively longer and thicker than the subsequent ones combined.

discussion
unique characters in rectilyda sticta gen. et sp. nov
since most xyelydids have been described from detached wings without preserved bodies, we summarize the reported data of wing lengths for all species of xyelydids in table  <dig>  the data show that forewing lengths  vary substantially from 5 mm in prolyda xyelocera rasnitsyn,  <dig> to  <dig>  mm in r. sticta gen. et sp. nov. the data show that r. sticta is the second largest xyelydid fossil recorded so far, only smaller than the relatively little-known sagulyda magna rasnitsyn,  <dig>  from the late early or early middle jurassic of central asia.

in addition, the direction of 1-rs varies significantly; 1-rs is normally proclival  or vertical , resulting in the angles between 1-rs and 1-m ranging from  <dig> ° to 140°  <cit> . however, in the vast and extensive cnub collection of more than  <dig> xyelydid fossils from china, r. sticta is the only one to date with 1-rs reclival. it also has 1-rs aligned linearly with 1-m , thus forming a “t” shape, which is normally present in the apocrita of the hymenoptera  <cit> . furthermore, the most basal sawflies usually possess sc in both wing pairs  <cit> . xyelydidae, as the most basal and putative stem group  in the superfamily pamphilioidea  <cit> , have plesiomorphic characters with sc bifurcate in their forewings, but sc absent in the hind wings. rectilyda sticta, however, has sc in both fore- and hind wings. in summary, unique and exceptional wing structures indicate that r. sticta has a combination of primitive and more derived characters highlighting its transitional role in the xyelydidae.

as aforementioned, hoplitolyda duolunica gao, shih, rasnitsyn & ren,  <dig>  collected from sandaogou township, duolun county, is thus far considered to be the largest sawfly in the praesiricidae, possibly in symphyta  <cit> . intriguingly, r. sticta is the second largest fossil specimen in the family xyelydidae. it is unknown whether this phenomenon of gigantism is just a coincidence due to sampling bias from limited collection of fossil specimens or if it was caused by some factors in the ecosystem and environment at this locality. gao et al.  <cit>  discussed possible reasons why hoplitolyda duolunica in the mesozoic could have reached such a large size and stated that it might have been caused by food availability or sexual selection. for now, however, it is unclear if gigantism was a natural phenomenon at the duolun locality and what factors could have resulted in giant body sizes, pending future collection of more large insect fossils from duolun.

about nygmata in the holometabola
nygmata on the wings of various holometabola have been known  since at least the later part of the 19th century. martynov  <cit>  made the first comprehensive study of nygmata using the term “facetic organs” to refer to mclahlan’s  “corneous points” as the first record that recognized these structures as very stable in their positions in respect to particular veins and forks in the wings of trichoptera. martynov demonstrated histologically that the “facetic organs” of trichoptera were glandular in nature , which were most developed in the young adults , but degenerated in older adults. he also described the structures as being specific to holometabola, but secondarily lost in coleoptera, diptera, and lepidoptera. of particular importance, he considered that numerous precursors found in corydalidae  indicate their possible abundance in the wings of ancestral holometabola. however, studies and publications by martynov  <cit>  have not been broadly noticed, and even as recent as  <dig> to  <dig>  nygmata have sometimes been referred to as “presumed sensory spots”  <cit> . however, the majority of authors recognize their glandular nature  <cit> . the idea of nygmata as a groundplan character of holometabola has been recently reiterated by minet et al.  <cit> .

nygmata are rarely present in compression fossils due to the nature of preservation. to date, nygmata have been reported on fossil wings in permochoristidae, permotanyderidae, parachoristidae and panorpidae of mecoptera  <cit> , parasialidae of megaloptera  <cit> , permithonidae of neuroptera  <cit> , microptysmatidae of trichoptera  <cit>  and in xyelidae of hymenoptera   <cit> . in addition, wang et al. recently reported nygmata in fossil neuropterans  <cit>  and liu et al. in fossil megalopterans  <cit> .

nygmata evolution in hymenoptera
of the extant hymenoptera, nygmata are present only in symphyta  <cit> . we examined various lower apocrita  and were unable to find any nygmata . our observations, including the numbers and positions of nygmata for symphyta, are summarized in table  <dig>  the data confirm that nygmata occur in almost every family of symphyta, but not in every genus. nygmata are particularly weakly visible, or apparently lost, in small sawflies, such as xyela dalman, pleroneura konow , heterarthrus stephens , etc. this may explain why nygmata are not detectable in syntexis rohwer,  <dig>  the only living representative of anaxyelidae. on the other hand, there are sawflies of large body size without any visible nygmata, e.g., neodiprion sertifer geoffroy,  <dig>  diprionidae.

 nygma weakly developed.

generally, the families with the highest number of cells with nygmata are in the extant pamphiliidae  and siricidae . the lowest number of cells with nygmata is recorded in the cephidae . other families take intermediate positions. even the most basal hymenopteran family, xyelidae, shows a modest development of nygmata , unless considering the four and two rudimentary nygmata in pleroneura konow,  <dig>  the nygmata of symphyta are characteristically found in the forewing cells of 1rm and 2rm and in the hind wing cell of 2 + 3rm. nygmata in the forewing 2rm and hind wing 2 + 3rm cells are the most stable. minet et al.  <cit>  have argued that nygmata located in the rs-m interspace are groundplan autapomorphies of the entire holometabola . in the case of venational reduction, the aforementioned stable set of nygmata would be useful for exploring cell and vein homology, provided the nygmata are persistent.

of the fossil xyelidae, both triassic asioxyela paurura rasnitsyn,  <dig>  and madygenius primitives rasnitsyn,  <dig>  have six nygmata in forewing cells 1rm, 1cua, 1a, 2rm, 3rm, and 2mcu  <cit>  . this implies that the low number of nygmata in the living xyelidae  is the result of a secondary reduction. in fact, xyelidae, the most basal hymenopteran family, is the most plesiomorphic in that respect as well. rectilyda sticta gen. et sp. nov. in the family of xyelydidae, the only other sawfly fossil with nygmata preserved, has four symmetrical nygmata on each forewing  and two in the hind wing, both in the cell 2 + 3rm . the latter two nygmata in one cell of the hind wing probably pertain to an origin as isolated cells of 2rm and 3rm, as is still retained by many members of the xyelidae. the siricid forewings are analogous; their cells 2rm and 3rm each preserve a nygma, even if a delimiting crossvein 2r-m is lost .

the family xyelidae appeared in the middle or upper triassic of kyrgyzstan in central asia  <cit>  and the upper triassic of australia  <cit> , south africa  <cit>  and argentina  <cit> . it is considered the most basal group in the phylogeny of symphyta and in hymenoptera  <cit> . shcherbakov  <cit>  considers permian parasialidae ponomarenko,  <dig>   to be ancestors of hymenoptera, because they are similar to symphytans in venation, pterostigma, and nygmata. however, this assumption contradicts several characters implying hymenoptera to be a sister group of all the remaining holometabola. in particular, the ovipositor structure of other holometabola have synapomorphies in having the second valves  reduced, and the third valves  fused and working as an intromittent organ inserted into the substrate during oviposition. in contrast, the groundplan hymenopteran ovipositor retains a pterygotan ground plan in that its 2nd valves are developed and functional, and the 3rd valves are free while serving as saw-like sheaths. additionally, current molecular phylogenies mainly show that hymenoptera is a sister group of the remaining holometabola  <cit> . nevertheless, wings of the parasialidae  could be taken as a rough model of a hymenopteran ancestor until a more likely ancestral group, the extinct order palaeomanteida  <cit> , is studied for nygmata in the future.

there is a general trend of a decreasing number of nygmata during the evolution of hymenopteran wings. this is evidenced by the seven forewing nygmata of parasialis latipennis ponomarenko,  <dig> in parasialidae in the permian , six nygmata for asioxyela paurura and madygenius primitives in xyelidae in the triassic  <cit>  , and one to three nygmata in most of the extant species among symphyta , except for pamphiliidae and siricidae, which have five . rectilyda sticta gen.et sp. nov., with its four nygmata, appears to have a transitional role in this general trend.

CONCLUSIONS
a thorough review of the various types of nygmata in extant and extinct hymenoptera suggests that in this order, the nygmata have had stable positions in the forewing cell of 2rm and hind wing cell of 2 + 3rm. in addition, the evolution of the hymenoptera has generally resulted in a decrease in the number of nygmata. most importantly, r. sticta gen. et sp. nov., with four nygmata, bridges the gap and provides rare insights into the trend of nygmata development over time, as well as the evolution of insects in general and of hymenopterans in particular.
