BACKGROUND
diatoms are eukaryotic unicellular plants that constitute one of the major components of marine phytoplankton  <cit>  comprising up to 40% of annual productivity at sea  <cit>  and representing up to 25% of global carbon-fixation  <cit> . natural  and/or anthropogenic  factors may alter the physiology and survival of diatoms, thereby influencing current levels of ocean primary productivity  <cit> . here we use reverse transcription-quantitative pcr  to identify key genes as indicators of defense processes activated in response to various stressful conditions in the ubiquitous diatom skeletonema marinoi, a species which forms massive blooms in many of the world’s coastal oceans  <cit> . previous studies on s. marinoi have focused on its genetic structure  <cit> , secondary metabolite production  <cit> , physiological response to nutrient limitation  <cit>  and interactions with zooplankton species  <cit> . this is the first study focusing on stress-related genes as health-status indicators in this diatom species.

the stress conditions tested were senescence, silicic acid limitation/starvation, co2-enrichment and the combination of these conditions. si-concentrations vary extensively in the world’s oceans, depending on the regions and depths analyzed  <cit>  and it is generally assumed that biogenic silicate content of some diatoms decreases under ocean acidification conditions  <cit> . since diatoms incorporate inorganic silicon into the cell as silica  <cit>  and use it to construct their outer cell wall, the availability and distribution of silicic acid can strongly modify diatom growth and population dynamics  <cit> . hence we hypothesized that the combination of ocean acidification and variations in silicic acid availability would potentially negatively impact diatom growth and modify stress gene expression levels  <cit> .

current levels of atmospheric co <dig> are predicted to be more than double by  <dig> . studies have reported contrasting results on the effects of ocean acidification in different phytoplankton species. some studies speculate that larger diatoms will be favored  <cit> , while others suggest that diatoms may age faster and undergo senescence/aging or even disappear in some areas of the oceans  <cit> .

in order to test the effects of these two stressors , we selected a panel of genes involved in both first  <cit>  and second lines of defense  <cit> : atp-binding cassette transporter , aldehyde dehydrogenases , succinate dehydrogenase , betaine aldh , glutathione synthase , glutathione peroxidase , glutathione reductase , glutathione s-transferase , catalase , superoxide dismutase , ascorbate peroxidase  and tocopherol cyclase  . we also analyzed glycolate oxidase , an enzyme involved in stress resistance in the higher plant arabidopsis thaliana  <cit>  and some of the major families of heat shock proteins , molecular chaperones known to be involved in the stress response induced by various environmental factors such as heat, cold, hypoxia, uv radiation and aging  <cit> . activation of all these genes is known to help adjust cellular physiology and metabolism to changing conditions by offering protection against cell damage or death in other organisms  <cit> .

RESULTS
aging
here we show that all the stress conditions tested  induced early aging in s. marinoi, as shown by net growth rates, which were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  d- <dig> for si-starvation,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  d- <dig> for si-depletion,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  d- <dig> for co2-enrichment and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  d- <dig> for co2-enrichment in combination with si-starvation  conditions, compared to the control  <dig>  ±  <dig>  d- <dig> . at the gene level, hsp expression levels increased in the stationary  and decline  phases of the growth curves in each studied condition . gene expression levels in the exponential phase  have been used as control condition for each rt-qpcr analysis shown in figure  <dig> . the increase was time dependent, with the highest up-regulation in the declining phase of growth. in particular, in the growth curve of algae cultured with complete medium , hsp70_ <dig> and hsp70_ <dig> were 2-fold up-regulated , while hsp <dig> was significantly 3-fold up-regulated  in stat. in the decl phase, hsp70_ <dig> and hsp70_ <dig> were 3-fold up-regulated , while hsp <dig> expression levels increased by 4-fold . the same pattern was observed for hsp expression level in the growth curve of algae grown in si-starvation  and in co2-si conditions . also in these cases, there was a time-dependent increase, but the up-regulation was statistically significant only for hsp <dig>  in si-starvation  and for hsp70_ <dig>  and hsp70_ <dig>  in co2-si condition . aging did not induce variations in other gene categories, with some exceptions. the glutathione-related enzymes gsh-s, gr and gst expression levels were higher in stat and decl phases in algae grown in complete medium , while gpx was down-regulated in both phases  compared to the exp one . gr also was significantly up-regulated in decl of the co2-si growth curve . abc also increased in stat and decl in the complete medium curve . ap and baldh increased in stat and decl , gr and aldh <dig> in decl  in the co2-si growth curve .figure  <dig> aging gene expression in the diatom skeletonema marinoi. expression levels of heat shock proteins, aldehyde dehydrogenases, glutathione-related enzymes and other antioxidants in s. marinoi during stationary  and declining  growth phases in nutrient complete medium , si-starvation  and co2-enriched/si-starvation , using their own exponential phase as control . data are represented as log <dig> x-fold expression ratio ± sd. gene abbreviations used are: heat shock proteins , luminal binding protein , aldehyde dehydrogenases , succinate dehydrogenase , betaine aldh , glutathione synthase , glutathione peroxidase , glutathione reductase , glutathione s-transferase , catalase , superoxide dismutase , ascorbate peroxidase , tocopherol cyclase , glycolate oxidase , atp-binding cassette transporter .



nutrient starvation/depletion
figure 2a shows gene expression changes in s. marinoi grown in si-starvation, while 2b in si-depletion condition. for both rt-qpcr analyses, gene expression levels of algae grown in complete medium have been used as control condition . in si-starvation, there was the down-regulation of almost all the genes of interest . hsp <dig> and ssd were the only genes that were down-expressed in exp . hsp70_ <dig>  hsp <dig>  aldh <dig> and gsh-s were down-regulated in stat . in decl, many genes showed decreased expression levels: hsp70_ <dig>  hsp <dig> , aldh <dig>  ssd, baldh, gsh-s, gpx, gr, sod and abc . hsp <dig> was the most affected gene, with a decrease of more than 4-fold. in si-depletion condition, the down-regulation was even more pronounced, with a reduction of more than 8-fold for aldh <dig> . hsps, aldehyde dehydrogenases and antioxidants were impaired. gox was the only exception and was significantly up-regulated in exp, stat and decl . the increase was a time-dependent with maximum up-regulation of more than 4-fold in decl .figure  <dig> gene expression in skeletonema marinoi grown in si-starvation or depletion conditions. expression levels of heat shock proteins, aldehyde dehydrogenases, glutathione-related enzymes and other antioxidants in s. marinoi during exponential, stationary and declining growth phases  in  si-starved or  si-depleted media, using s. marinoi grown in complete medium as control . data are represented as log <dig> x-fold expression ratio ± sd. gene abbreviations used are: heat shock proteins , luminal binding protein , aldehyde dehydrogenases , succinate dehydrogenase , betaine aldh , glutathione synthase , glutathione peroxidase , glutathione reductase , glutathione s-transferase , catalase , superoxide dismutase , ascorbate peroxidase , tocopherol cyclase , glycolate oxidase , atp-binding cassette transporter .



co2-enrichment and combinations
co2-bubbling for only four hours, did not induce different expression level changes in the genes of interest , but algae grown in co2-si condition for four hours showed increased levels of hsp70_ <dig>  hsp <dig>  baldh, gox and abc  and a decrease in aldh <dig>  cat, sod and ap  . finally, using co2-enriched medium for the entire growth curve  there was the down-regulation of almost all the genes, with the lowest reduction in aldh <dig> . hsp70_ <dig> and hsp70_ <dig> were down-regulated in decl , aldh <dig> in exp and stat , aldh <dig> and ssd in exp, stat and decl  and baldh only in decl . for the glutathione-related genes and others, gsh-s, gst, cat, sod and abc decreased in stat . gsh-s, gr, cat, sod, ap and abc decreased in stat , whereas gsh-s, gst, cat, sod, tocc and abc decreased in decl . only ap and gpx showed increased expression levels . when this experimental condition was combined with si-starvation  only down-regulation patterns were observed, with the lowest reduction of more than 13-fold . in exp, hsp70_ <dig>  aldh <dig>  aldh <dig>  ssd, gr, gst, sod and ap were reduced , in stat, hsp70_ <dig>  hsp70_ <dig>  aldh <dig>  aldh <dig>  ssd, gr, gst and sod  were reduced while in decl, hsp70_ <dig>  aldh <dig>  ssd, gsh-s, gst, sod and tocc  were reduced. for some genes, changes were not significant . all the results are summarized in figure  <dig> figure  <dig> gene expression in skeletonema marinoi grown four hours in co2-enriched or co2-enriched si-starved medium. expression levels of heat shock proteins, aldehyde dehydrogenases, glutathione-related enzymes and other antioxidants in s. marinoi grown four hours in co2-enriched medium  or in co2-enriched/si-starvation medium . s. marinoi grown in complete medium was used as control . data are represented as log <dig> x-fold expression ratio ± sd. gene abbreviations used are: heat shock proteins , luminal binding protein , aldehyde dehydrogenases , succinate dehydrogenase , betaine aldh , glutathione synthase , glutathione peroxidase , glutathione reductase , glutathione s-transferase , catalase , superoxide dismutase , ascorbate peroxidase , tocopherol cyclase , glycolate oxidase , atp-binding cassette transporter .



discussion
stress is associated with the generation of reactive oxygen species . in low quantities, ros are rapidly converted to less reactive forms, but when present in abnormally high quantities, they can be very damaging to dna, rna and proteins. several studies have reported an increase in the activity of antioxidant ros-scavenging enzymes also with aging  <cit> , but this has not yet been shown in marine diatoms. our results indicate that some of the antioxidants  were up-regulated during aging  in s. marinoi in normal  and co2-si conditions . in addition, our results show that hsp expression levels increase with aging in all conditions tested. an increase in hsps with aging was first observed in drosophila melanogaster  <cit>  due to an increase in misfolded proteins and the expression of chaperonines  for protein re-folding. hsp expression levels increased in both stat and decl phases of s. marinoi growth  in normal , si-starvation , co2-si  and co <dig> enrichment  conditions. the increase was time-dependent, with the highest up-regulation in the declining phase . on the contrary, aging did not induce changes in expression levels in the other gene categories studied, e.g. aldhs and other antioxidants. these results suggest the potential use of hsps and some antioxidants  as indicators of aging in marine diatoms.

stress caused by silicic acid and iron starvation induced early aging in the diatom thalassiosira pseudonana  <cit> . here we show that nutrient starvation/depletion  and co2-enrichment induced early aging in s. marinoi, as shown by net growth rates. these data suggest that the strongest stressful condition for s. marinoi survival in the present study was the absence of silicates.

we then analysed gene expression levels under two nutrient conditions: reduction of silicic acid in the culturing medium  and complete si-removal . nutrient depletion/reduction did not induce activation of hsps and the majority of tested genes. in both experiments, expression levels of hsps, aldhs, gsh-s, gr, gpx and gst were significantly reduced without silicic acid or in si-starvation conditions compared to controls . interestingly, a decrease in expression levels was time-dependent in si-starvation conditions only for gsh-s, gr, gpx and gst, with highest expression in the exponential phase  and lowest in the declining phase  . gene down-regulation in cells grown without silicic acid was even more pronounced. in order to understand if the observed down-regulation is si-limitation specific or is common for other nutrient limitation conditions, we also cultivated s. marinoi in phosphate-starvation . results showed that also in this case there was a significant down-regulation of the genes of interest, except for the up-regulation of gox, of the antioxidant gpx and the chaperonine hsp <dig> . overall, this reduction in gene expression in response to nutrient starvation may indicate a cell strategy to avoid unnecessary over-investment in the respective proteins, similar to the depression in protein synthesis that occurs in other organisms during environmental stress, considered a substantial bioenergetic saving process  <cit> .

co2-enrichment is reported to induce contrasting results in phytoplankton, with more or less tolerant species, such as cyanidium caldarium and tetraselmis sp, respectively  <cit> . engel et al.  <cit>  carried out a mesocosm experiment to document the effect of co <dig> concentration on a bloom of the haptophyte algae emiliania huxleyi, which supported earlier findings of reduced calcification at higher co <dig> concentrations. hutchins et al.  <cit>  studied dinitrogen  and co <dig> fixation rates under future co <dig> scenarios in the marine cyanobacteria trichodesmium, which contributes a large fraction of the new nitrogen entering the oligotrophic oceans. they suggested that predicted elevated co <dig> levels in the future could alter current marine n and c cycles. here, we tested the effect of co2-enrichment, alone or in combination with si-starvation, after four hours and after prolonged exposure . after  <dig> hours of co2-enrichment, various genes were up-regulated , but after prolonged exposure  these levels were significantly reduced, suggesting that the activation of these genes may be only a short-term stress signal. copper stress induced a similar response in the diatom thalassiosira pseudonana  <cit> . this diatom exhibited a rapid induction of certain cu-related genes to elevated concentrations of copper , but this response was attenuated over  <dig> h of continuous exposure. the down-regulation observed in co2-enrichment experiments  may be an energetic cost-saving strategy used by organisms to allow restoration of homeostasis and survival  <cit> .

in contrast to most of the stress-related genes studied here, glycolate oxidase  was up-regulated in si-depletion, after prolonged co2-bubbling, co2-si, and p-starvation . glycolate oxidizing enzyme is known to play a key role in photorespiratory carbon metabolism responsible for reducing carbon loss and oxidative damage  <cit> . however, photorespiration also plays other roles in higher plants e.g. amino acid metabolism, nitrate reduction, stress resistance, and signal transduction  <cit> . our results suggest a specific protective antioxidant activity for gox that does not always imply a change in c metabolism, as also found in the higher plants arabidopsis thaliana and oryza sativa  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our results provide first insights on early warning signals for environmental stressful conditions, such as those predicted under a global climate change scenario, in the ubiquitous diatom skeletonema marinoi . nutrient starvation/depletion, co2-enrichment and the combined effect of stressors, impact the growth rate of this species, inducing early aging. hsps behave as signals of senescence/aging  and short-term exposure to stress  whereas the antioxidant gox as a signal of strong nutrient depletion  and/or exposure to high co <dig> concentration with or without si-starvation .
