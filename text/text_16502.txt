BACKGROUND
metagenomics, the analysis of dna isolated from environmental samples, has proven particularly useful for the study of uncultured bacteria, given that it has been estimated that less than 1% of microorganisms found in natural environments can be cultured with currently available technologies  <cit> . in light of the enormous abundance of uncultivated microbes that are adapted to a wide range of physical-chemical parameters matching industrial requirements with regards to ph, pressure and temperature, metagenomics potentially opens the door to new sources of industrial enzymes with unique properties  <cit> . in this context, the psychrophilic and some psychrotrophic microorganisms, which are capable of thriving in cold environments, seem to be an excellent source of enzymes characterized by high catalytic rates at low temperatures. in general, a low-temperature industrial process saves energy, protects the thermolabile substrates and/or products from degradation, and decreases the rate of the nonspecific chemical reaction. moreover, in the food industry, a low-temperature enzymatic process could decrease the risk of infection by, and growth of, mesophilic microorganisms, especially those pathogenic for human and animals.

β-galactosidases  have been extensively studied for their utility in a variety of industrial technologies. in general, β-galactosidases catalyze the hydrolysis of the o-glycosidic bond in β-galactosides, such as lactose. at present, a commercially available β-galactosidase from the mesophilic yeast kluyveromyces lactis is used in the production of lactose-reduced milk for people with lactose intolerance. in addition, the hydrolysis of lactose in dairy products increases their sweetness and eliminates the ‘sandy defect’ arising during lactose crystallization at low temperatures  <cit> . however, the main disadvantage of this mesophilic enzyme as an industrial biocatalyst is its poor activity at temperatures below 20°c. ideally, a β-galactosidase for treating refrigerated milk in the dairy industry should be highly active and stable at approximately 10°c and easy to inactivate at a higher temperature. moreover, an enzyme of this nature should be active and stable at ph  <dig> - <dig> , and not be inhibited by ions or monosugars, which are natural products of lactose hydrolysis, such as ca2+, or d-glucose and d-galactose, respectively. therefore, a great deal of effort has been invested in the isolation and characterization of new cold-active β-galactosidases from cultivable, cold-adapted bacteria and yeasts  <cit> . however, to the best of our knowledge, a cold-adapted β-galactosidase, which would satisfactorily fulfill the abovementioned requirements and, at the same time, be easy and inexpensive to manufacture, has not yet been identified.

our previous studies focused on the identification and characterization of cold-active β-galactosidases that were sourced from culturable bacterial strains  <cit> . therefore, in this study, we decide to apply the metagenomic approach, which could also serve to expand our search for β-galactosidases derived from nonculturable bacteria. to this end, a plasmid metagenomic dna library was constructed using total dna isolated from a baltic sea water sample. through activity-based screening of the resulting dna library for β-galactosidase active clones, a novel glycoside hydrolase gene, designated as bglmkg was isolated. the bglmkg gene was cloned, expressed in escherichia coli, and the detailed biochemical characterization of the recombinant enzyme was conducted.

RESULTS
construction of a metagenomic library and screening for clones encoding β-galactosidase activity
to isolate the gene encoding the enzyme with β-galactosidase activity, a metagenomic library containing about  <dig> clones was constructed using dna obtained from a sample of baltic sea water collected in kołobrzeg, poland. after  <dig> h incubation of recombinant e. coli colonies at 20°c, only one colony turned blue on lb plates supplemented with 5-bromo-4-chloro-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside . this positive clone with β-galactosidase activity, designated as insmkg, was selected for further characterization. the dna of the recombinant plasmid pbad/insmkg was extracted and digested with selected restriction enzymes in order to create restriction maps of the construct.

the dna sequence analysis of a metagenomic dna insert of pbad/insmkg
the nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that the metagenomic dna insert of the pbad/insmkg plasmid contained two partial orfs at the 5′ and 3′ terminals and a complete orf in the middle . the partial orf <dig>  the complete orf <dig>  and the partial orf <dig> revealed the highest sequence homology to the dna sequences of the sfri_ <dig>  sfri_ <dig> and sfri_ <dig> genes from shewanella frigidimarina ncimb  <dig> , respectively. moreover, the layout of the orfs from the metagenomic dna insert corresponded to the layout of the sfri_ <dig>  sfri_ <dig> and sfri_ <dig> genes in the genome of shewanella frigidimarina ncimb  <dig>  further analysis revealed that the layout of these three orfs also corresponded to the layout of three genes from the bgl cluster genes encoded proteins involved in the putative β-glucoside-containing glucans utilization pathway in shewanella spp.   <cit> . moreover, this comparative sequence analysis also revealed that the partial orf <dig> and the partial orf <dig> corresponded to the bglt and glcpbgl genes of the bgl cluster, respectively. the bglt and glcpbgl genes encoded a putative glucose/galactose transporter and a putative sugar  transporter, respectively, whereas the orf <dig> corresponded to the bglai gene, and encoded one of three putative glucosidases of the reconstructed bgl utilization pathway in shewanella spp. rodionov et al. proposed that two putative glucosidases, lama and bglaii, are secreted outside of the cell and to the periplasm, respectively, whereas bglai is most likely a cytoplasmic enzyme. the extracellular endo-β- <dig> -glucanase lama hydrolyses β-glucoside-containing glucans to oligo-β-glucosides, which are transported to the periplasm by ompbgl, and subsequently utilized by bglaii to produce d-glucose and shorter β-glucosides. finally, the products of hydrolysis, such as cellobiose or gentiobiose, are taken up by the predicted bglt transporter into the cytoplasm, where they are finally hydrolyzed by the bglai enzyme  <cit> . in light of this data, it seemed possible that the orf <dig>  named bglmkg, encoded an enzyme with β-glucosidase activity specific toward disaccharides consisting mainly of two glucose molecules. therefore, we also tested this hypothesis during the study.

the nucleotide sequence analysis of the metagenomic dna insert also identified the putative promoter sequences:   <dig> bp upstream a bglmkg gene, predicted with the bprom program, and   <dig> bp or  <dig> bp upstream the bglmkg gene, predicted with the neural network promoter prediction program. therefore, in our opinion, it appears possible that the bglmkg gene was expressed from its own promoter in e. coli cells . moreover, we discovered that the consensus dna-binding motif proposed by rodionov et al. <cit>  as a binding site for a laci-type transcriptional regulator bglr is present  <dig> bp upstream from the bglmkg gene .

sequence analysis of bglmkg
the deduced product of bglmkg consists of  <dig> amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of  <dig>  da and shares a highest sequence identity of 75% with a β-glucosidase encoded by the sfri_ <dig> gene from shewanella frigidimarina ncimb  <dig> . however, to the best of our knowledge, the putative β-glucosidase of shewanella frigidimarina ncimb  <dig> has not been biochemically characterized to date. in contrast, among the well-characterized enzymes deposited in the genbank database , the highest sequence identity  to the bglmkg enzyme was shown by a metagenomic-derivate bgl1a β-glucosidase  <cit> . interestingly, the bgl1a enzyme revealed a lack of β-galactosidase activity.

prediction of the occurrence of functional domains and a putative active site in bglmkg with interproscan allowed the bglmkg enzyme to be classified as a new member of glycoside hydrolase family  <dig>   <cit> . gh <dig> comprises enzymes with a number of known activities, such as, β-glucosidase ; β-galactosidase ; β-mannosidase ; β-glucuronidase ; β-fucosidase ; 6-phospho-β-galactosidase ; and 6-phospho-β-glucosidase  . moreover, this analysis revealed that residues e <dig> and e <dig> of bglmkg correspond to the conserved catalytic glutamic acid residues involved in the catalytic activity of gh <dig> enzymes .

on the other hand, the similarity of the bglmkg enzyme to the bglai β-glucosidase proposed as a cytoplasmic enzyme by rodionov et al. <cit> , encouraged us to examine the possibility that bglmkg is subcellularly localized. therefore, owning to the high sequence similarity of orfs in the metagenomic dna insert to the sfri_ <dig>  sfri_ <dig> and sfri_ <dig> genes in the genome of shewanella frigidimarina ncimb  <dig>  we assumed that the our metagenomic dna is also of bacterial origin. the analysis of the bglmkg amino acid sequence with the signalp  <dig>  server in relation to this assumption revealed the lack of any signal sequence in bglmkg that could be involved in its transport to the periplasmic space or outside the bacterial cell. moreover, another sequence analysis, carried out with the prosite program, showed the localization of the bglmkg enzyme in the cytoplasm. in short, the results presented here suggest that the bglmkg enzyme could be a cytoplasmic enzyme of bacterial origin.

expression and purification of the bglmkg enzyme
the arabinose-inducible promoter of the pbad-myc-his a plasmid was used for the expression of the metagenomic-derived bglmkg gene in e. coli lmg <dig> cells. the highest enzyme production yields were achieved by adding l-arabinose to a final concentration of  <dig> % w/v, at a <dig> od =  <dig>  and by further cultivation at 30°c for  <dig> h. the recombinant bglmkg protein was purified using fplc and the procedure is summarized in table  <dig>  the obtained enzyme was ~85% pure  as determined by sds-page . unfortunately, we found that the further purification of bglmkg with the resource q column led to a remarkable decrease of approximately 50% in enzyme activity, without significantly increasing the purity . therefore, we decided to reduce the purification procedure to the one-step.

the enzyme had an estimated apparent molecular weight of approximately  <dig> kda corresponding to the expected molecular weight calculated from the bglmkg amino acid sequence. the relative molecular mass of recombinant bglmkg, which was determined by gel filtration, was ~ <dig> kda, suggesting that the native enzyme is a monomer protein. to date, several other enzymes belonging to gh <dig> family have also been reported as monomeric proteins  <cit> .

substrate specificity of bglmkg
owing to the variety of enzymatic activities within glycoside hydrolases family  <dig>  we decided to examine the enzymatic specificity of bglmkg toward the various chromogenic substrates presented in table  <dig>  the enzyme hydrolyzed p-np-β-d-glucopyranoside , p-np-β-d-fucopyranoside , o-np-β-d-galactopyranoside , p-np-β-d-galactopyranoside , p-np-β-d-cellobioside  and p-np-β-d-xylopyranoside . this is consistent with past studies, which have also reported gh <dig> enzymes with a wide range of enzymatic activities  <cit> . what is important to note is that the bglmkg enzyme revealed higher relative activities against substrates specific for β-glucosidase  and β-fucosidase  than against o-np-β-d-galactopyranoside  and p-np-β-d-galactopyranoside , the substrates specific for β-galactosidase. moreover, the bglmkg showed markedly higher activity against the p-np-β-d-glucopyranoside, an analogue of a cellobiose consisting of two glucose molecules linked by a β-1→ <dig> bond, than it did for p-np-β-d-cellobioside, an analogue of a cellotriose consisting of three glucose molecules linked by β-1→ <dig> bonds, respectively.

moreover, we also determined the enzymatic activity of bglmkg against various disaccharides consisting of two glucose molecules linked by α- or β-glycosidic bonds and lactose consisting of one glucose molecule and one galactose molecule linked by a β-glycosidic bond, respectively. the results presented in table  <dig> demonstrate that bglmkg revealed the highest relative enzymatic activity against cellobiose , compared with its relative activities against lactose , sophorose , and gentiobiose . moreover, the enzymatic activity of bglmkg against substrates with different kinds of α-glycosidic bonds was not detected . to summarize, in the light of the results presented herein, it seems highly probable that bglmkg is a cytosolic β-glucosidase with high enzymatic activity against disaccharides consisting primarily of glucose molecules linked by β-glycosidic bonds.

with regard to possible industrial applications, further characterization of the enzymatic properties of bglmkg was carried out using substrates specific for β-galactosidase  and β-glucosidase . however, given the lack of information about the usefulness of β-fucosidases in industry, further characterization of bglmkg with substrate specific for β-fucosidase was not carried out. we determined the influence of the temperature, ph, and products of cellobiose or lactose hydrolysis on both the enzymatic activities of bglmkg, respectively.

physicochemical characterization and determination of kinetic parameters
the optimal temperatures for the β-galactosidase and β-glucosidase activities of bglmkg were determined over a temperature range of 0°c to 65°c. as shown in figure  <dig>  bglmkg had almost the same relative activities for onpgal and pnpglc over a temperature range of 0°c to 40°c. maximal β-galactosidase and β-glucosidase activities were observed at 40°c and 45°c, respectively. the relative activities of bglmkg above 50°c were higher for onpgal than for pnpglc . moreover, we determined that both the enzyme activities were retained at 97% after  <dig> h of incubation over a temperature range of  <dig> to 30°c, and that the enzyme was rapidly inactivated at temperatures above 40°c .

the optimal phs for the β-galactosidase and β-glucosidase activities of bglmkg were studied over a ph range of  <dig>  to  <dig>  and at 20°c. as shown in figure  <dig>  bglmkg with onpgal as a substrate had above 90% of maximum activity at ph  <dig> – <dig> , with the maximum at ph  <dig> . in contrast, with pnpglc as a substrate, it had above 90% of maximum activity over a broad ph range of  <dig> – <dig> , with the maximum at ph  <dig> . in addition, we found that both the enzyme activities remained at 98% from ph  <dig>  to  <dig> , and at ~80% at ph  <dig> , after  <dig> h of incubation . the enzyme was rapidly inactivated at phs below  <dig>  and above  <dig> .

the β-galactosidase activity of bglmkg toward onpgal continually decreased with an increase of d-glucose from  <dig> mm to  <dig> mm, whereas it was slightly increased in the presence of d-galactose at  <dig> mm and decreased by d-galactose at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mm . in contrast, the β-glucosidase activity of bglmkg was strongly inhibited by d-glucose at  <dig> mm, and less so at the higher concentrations of d-glucose .

the study of the kinetic properties  revealed that bglmkg had higher affinities  for cellobiose and pnpglc than lactose and onpgal . moreover, table  <dig> shows that the kcat/km values for cellobiose and pnpglc are approximately  <dig> times higher than the kcat/km values for lactose and onpgal. these results indicate that bglmkg is much more efficient at the hydrolysis of β-glucosidase substrates than for the β-galactosidase ones.

in summary, the ph of natural milk is about  <dig> – <dig> , which could suggest that bglmkg is a suitable enzyme for the hydrolysis of lactose in refrigerated milk. however, in our opinion, the catalytic properties of this enzyme and its strong inhibition by d-glucose and d-galactose disqualify it as a new candidate for developing a low-cost, lactose hydrolysis technology based on an enzymatic process. in contrast, in the light of data presented here, the bglmkg enzyme appears to be an interesting industrial candidate as a novel cold-active β-glucosidase. first, at ~ <dig> kda, it is a small, monomeric enzyme, which is an advantage for its production in a heterologous host in general  <cit> . second, it shows above 90% of maximum β-glucosidase activity over a broad ph range of  <dig> – <dig> . finally, it is stable below 30°c and is easy to inactivate rapidly above this temperature. however, the remarkable inhibition of bglmkg β-glucosidase by d-glucose could be a disadvantage for some industrial applications, for example, the enzymatic bioconversion of lignocellulolytic materials. therefore, we also decided to study the effects of selected metal ions  and chemical compounds  on the bglmkg β-glucosidase activity.

to examine the possible metal ion requirements of the enzyme , activity tests were conducted in mops buffer. in the presence of all the ions tested, the β-glucosidase activity was markedly decreased, with the strongest inhibition being found for zn2+ ions. unfortunately, the negative effect of the presence of metal ions on the bglmkg β-glucosidase activity seems to be another disadvantage for its application in industrial processes. however, the addition of an ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid  chelating agent at a low concentration  could reduce the effect of the divalent metal ions in this respect.

the β-glucosidase activity of bglmkg was then examined in the presence of selected reagents. table  <dig> shows that dithiothreitol  significantly increases the enzyme activity, whereas sodium dodecyl sulfate  and oxidized glutathione are both strong inhibitors. the strong inhibition effect of oxidized glutathione and the strong positive effect of dtt on bglmkg activity could suggest the importance of cys residues in the amino acid sequence of this enzyme. however, it is important to note that the sequence analysis of bglmkg, a member of gh <dig>  showed that the cys residues are not directly involved in the catalysis . instead, the analysis of the bglmkg sequence with the dianna  <dig>  program revealed the possibility of the formation of three putative sulfide bonds in the model structure of the bglmkg enzyme. in this case, the positive effect of the dtt, a strong reducing agent, on bglmkg enzymatic activity would be a result of the prevention of the formation of an intramolecular and/or an intermolecular disulfide bond between the cysteine residues of bglmkg. however, this hypothesis must still be verified empirically. the negative effect of the oxidized glutathione on the studied enzyme activity would be caused by s-glutathionylation of cysteine residues  <cit> .

it should also be noted that the bglmkg enzyme lost enzymatic activity in a  <dig> mm tris buffer , while changing to a  <dig> mm sodium phosphate buffer with the same ph restored the activity to 90% of that in the buffer c . the inhibition of the enzymatic activity by 2-amino-2-hydroxymethyl-propane- <dig> -diol  was also reported for β-glucosidase from agrobacterium faecalis <cit> . in both cases, the inhibition caused by tris is consistent with that seen for other enzymes such as β-galactosidase  <cit> , α-amylase  <cit> , and α-galactosidase  <cit>  and is presumably the reflection of the general affinity of glycosidases for hydroxylated amines  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we sought to identify an enzyme with β-galactosidase activity that would have the capability of hydrolyzing lactose in milk at a low temperature. we constructed a metagenomic library from a sample of baltic sea water and identified a gene encoding a novel enzyme with β-galactosidase, β-fucosidase and β-glucosidase activities. the detailed analysis of the data obtained lead us to conclude that the bglmkg enzyme is a bacterial cytosolic β-glucosidase, a new member of gh <dig> family, characterized by a wide range of enzymatic activities including β-fucosidase and β-galactosidase. it is especially important to note that the enzymatic properties of bglmkg do not fulfill the requirements of a β-galactosidase for commercial use in the dairy industry. however, its wide spectrum of specificity and activity makes this novel, cold-active enzyme potentially interesting for other industrial sectors. we will therefore undertake another study in order to characterize the potential of this novel, cold-adapted β-glucosidase for the hydrolysis of selected, naturally occurring glycosides used in the pharmaceutical, chemical and food industries. gh <dig> β-glucosidases can also catalyze a reverse transglycosylation reaction  <cit> . therefore, we also plan to examine the fitness of bglmkg for this purpose in oligosaccharides synthesis.
