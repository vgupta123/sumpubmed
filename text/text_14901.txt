BACKGROUND
postweaning diarrhoea  is usually the main infectious problem of large-scale farms and is responsible for significant losses worldwide  <cit> . the disease is caused mainly by enterotoxigenic e. coli , and shiga-toxin producing e. coli , also called verotoxin-producing e. coli   <cit> . porcine pathogenic e. coli involved in pwd typically belong to serogroups o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig> and o <dig>  of which o <dig> seems to be the predominant serogroup in most countries  <cit> . etec can cause severe diarrhoea in newborn and weaned piglets by the production of heat-labile enterotoxin  and/or heat-stable enterotoxins . these enterotoxins are extracellular proteins or peptides, which are able to cause diarrhoea by changing the water and electrolyte balance of the small intestine  <cit> . porcine stec produce the edema verotoxin , also named shiga toxin 2e , which damages the vascular endothelium of the small intestine, subcutis and brain and ultimately leads to subcutanneous edema and neurological disorders  <cit> . etec and stec implicated in pwd in pigs most frequently produce either the f <dig>  or f <dig> fimbrial adhesins  <cit> . two variants of the f <dig> fimbriae exist: f18ab  and f18ac   <cit> . f18ac is associated with diarrhoea while f18ab is involved in edema disease  <cit> . in addition to f <dig>  and f <dig>  other fimbrial colonization antigens such as f <dig> , f <dig> , and f <dig> have also been associated with postweaning diarrhoea, but less frequently  <cit> .

porcine attaching and effacing e. coli  induce intestinal lesions similar to those produced by enteropathogenic e. coli  in humans. these e. coli carry eae gene encoding a  <dig> kda outer membrane protein  which is responsible for intimate attachment to epithelial cells. however, the pathogenic significance of porcine eae-positive isolates in weaned pigs is unclear  <cit> . a new category of the diarrhoeagenic e. coli family, named enteroaggregative e. coli , has been recognized. eaec elaborate a low-molecular-weight, partially heat-stable, plasmid-encoded enterotoxin named enteroaggregative e. coli heat-stable enterotoxin  <dig> . the gene  encoding the production of east <dig> has been detected in several groups of diarrhoeagenic e. coli  isolated from humans and from pigs. the pathogenic significance of east <dig> in diarrhoea in pigs is not known  <cit> .

although, pwd is frequently observed in slovakia, there is a lack of information about the prevalence of serogroups, serotypes, and virulence factors of porcine pathogenic e. coli. thus, the aim of this study was to determine the distribution of serogroups, serotypes, and virulence genes, and to study the genetic relatedness among e. coli isolated from pigs with pwd. this is the first study in slovak republic of a large collection of pathogenic e. coli isolated from pwd.

RESULTS
serogroups and serotypes
the  <dig> porcine isolates belonged to  <dig> o serogroups and  <dig> o:h serotypes. however, 54% were of one of these eight serogroups  and 57% of the isolates belonged to only six serotypes, including two new  serotypes not previously found among porcine pathogenic e. coli. the most common serotypes were: o149:h <dig> , ont:h- , o163:h- , o9:h <dig> , ont:h <dig> , and o147:h-  .

toxin genes
amplification of the toxin genes by pcr showed that 77% of isolates possessed genes for production of five types of toxins: lt, sta, stb, stx2e, and east <dig>  the gene encoding for east <dig> toxin  was the most prevalent, followed by the stb , sta , and lt  genes. the stx2e gene was detected in five isolates, which also carried genes for sta and stb . genes encoding stx <dig>  stx1c, stx1d, stx <dig>  stx2c, stx2d, and stx2g toxins were not detected in any of the  <dig> porcine isolates studied.

adhesin genes
the pcr analysis of all  <dig> isolates of e. coli showed that  <dig>  carried at least one fimbrial or intimin gene. the most prevalent fimbrial adhesin was f <dig>  detected in  <dig> isolates. analysis by restriction endonucleases of pcr f18-positive products revealed that all  <dig> f18-positive isolates showed the f18ac variant. three of these  <dig> f <dig> isolates were also positive for either f <dig> or f <dig> genes. the gene encoding f <dig> was identified in  <dig> isolates. f <dig>  f <dig>  f <dig>  and f <dig> genes were detected in five, one, one, and three isolates, respectively. the eae gene  was detected in only one isolate  of serotype o45:h- .

of the  <dig> e. coli f4-positive,  <dig> isolates belonged to o149:h <dig> serotype. the remaining four isolates belonged to o8:h <dig>  o8:hnt, o118:h <dig>  and ont:h <dig>  the f <dig> isolates were distributed in a wide range of serotypes, however,  <dig> of  <dig> isolates belonged to four predominant including o163:h- , ont:h- , ont:h <dig> , and o147:h- . also f <dig> isolates were widespread among serotypes. isolates carrying f <dig> gene belonged to o141:h <dig>  o147:h-, and ont:h- serotypes, and the isolate carrying both f <dig> and f <dig> genes belonged to ont:h <dig> serotype.

most isolates showing genes for fimbrial adhesins also possessed genes for toxin production, and the most common associations were: lt/stb/east1/f <dig> , east1/f <dig> , sta/stb/f <dig> , sta/stb/east1/f <dig> , sta/stb/stx2e/f <dig> , sta/stb/east1/f <dig> , and sta/stb/east1/f17/f <dig> .

seropathotypes
although the  <dig> porcine e. coli isolates belonged to  <dig> different seropathotypes , only seven accounted for 39% of isolates. seropathotype o149:h <dig> lt/stb/east1/f <dig>  was the most common, followed by o163:h- east1/f <dig> , and ont:h <dig> sta/stb/stx2e/f <dig>  .

haemolytic activity
haemolytic activity on blood agar plates was detected in  <dig>  of the  <dig> e. coli isolates. all f <dig> and f <dig> isolates were haemolytic. regarding the serotypes, all isolates of o149:h <dig>  o163:h- and ont:h <dig> serotypes were haemolytic .

macrorestriction fragment analysis by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis 
a representative group of  <dig> isolates  were selected to be analyzed by pfge: o149:h <dig> , o163:h- , o147:h- , ont:h- , ont:h <dig> , o <dig> , and o60:h- . the study revealed  <dig> distinct restriction profiles, considering as significative a difference of a single band . in the dendrogram produced by the upgma algorithm, the isolates were clustered in eight groups  of 70% similarity according to the dice similarity index, with  <dig> isolates clustering in nine subgroups of closely related  pfge profiles. e. coli isolates of the same serotype were placed together in the dendrogram, but high degree of polymorphism among certain serotypes was detected. thus, the  <dig> o149:h <dig> isolates were clustered in three groups  with only three small subgroups of closely related profiles . genetic distance among o149:h <dig> isolates was as considerable as similarity < 66%. group v clustered  <dig> isolates  with three subgroups . curiously, the highest homogeneity  was observed among a group of  <dig> isolates  belonging to serotypes o147:h-  and ont:h- . e. coli isolates of serotypes o141:h- and o141:h <dig> were clustered in group vii . and all five isolates of serotype ont:h <dig> clustered in group viii showing a similarity > 81%.

discussion
it is widely accepted that specific serotypes and pathotypes of etec and stec are responsible for the major part of pwd in piglets. however, the distribution and frequencies of serotypes and pathotypes can vary considerably from region to region and over time in a given region. the majority of the virulence factors are controlled by transferable genetic elements  and thus, common pathogenic seropathotypes may be replaced by previously uncommon types emerging as new pig pathogenic e. coli.

this is the first study in slovak republic of a large collection of pathogenic e. coli isolated from pwd. in the present study, although  <dig> isolates belonged to  <dig> different o:h serotypes, more than a half of etec and stec belonged to only five serotypes: o147:h-, o149:h <dig>  o163:h-, ont:h-, and ont:h <dig>  most isolates of these five serotypes possessed either the f <dig> or the f <dig> genes. etec of o147:h-, o149:h <dig> and ont:h- serotypes are also frequently detected in pigs from other countries, especially o149:h <dig>  <cit> . the seropathotype o149:h <dig> lt/stb/east1/f <dig>  was the most prevalent in the present study, and the reason for its predominance is not known. a possible explanation could be that the virulence factor association of these isolates makes them especially adapted to propagation in swine populations and their enviroment  <cit> .

the main discovery of this study was the identification of two new serotypes  not previously detected among porcine etec and stec isolated in other geographical zones. all  <dig> isolates of o163: h- serotype harbored the f18ac fimbriae gene and five of them were positives for sta and stb enterotoxins. interestingly, all five stx2e-positive isolates identified in the current study belonged to the new serotype ont:h <dig>  in previous studies the stx2e production was associated mainly with o138:h <dig>  o138:h-, o139:h <dig>  o141:h <dig>  o147:h <dig> and o157:h <dig> serotypes  <cit> . thus, this study reports two new serotypes  emerging as pig pathogens in slovakia.

although haemolysin does not seem to play an essential role in the virulence of porcine etec and stec, most of the typical pwd e. coli are haemolytic  <cit> . in this study, 71% of isolates were haemolytic, and  <dig> isolates of those  <dig> possessed other virulence genes. furthermore, all  <dig> isolates belonging to the three seroypes  most frequently detected in this study showed haemolytic activity. thus, the haemolytic activity is a very good marker for pig pathogenic e. coli.

f <dig> and f <dig> are the most important fimbrial adhesins of etec and stec causing pwd  <cit> . in the present study using pcr analysis, it was shown that 35% of e. coli isolated from pwd carried genes for f <dig> colonization antigen. our findings are in accordance with those of others  <cit> . based on the studies of rippinger et al.  <cit> , the f18-family of fimbriae were divided into two variants f18ab and f18ac. the e. coli expressing f18ab cause edema disease, whereas the isolates with f18ac cause pwd  <cit> . in the present study, after digestion of pcr products of f <dig> isolates, all  <dig> f18-positive showed the f18ac variant, and more than a half of these  <dig> isolates belonged to o <dig>  o <dig> and o <dig> serogroups. we found that  <dig>  of  <dig> isolates from pigs with pwd carried the f <dig> gene. several studies have demonstrated that the o serogroups associated with the fimbria f <dig> are mainly: o <dig>  o <dig>  and o <dig>  <cit> . our results confirm these findings as  <dig> of  <dig> of slovak f <dig> isolates belonged to o <dig> and o <dig> serogroups.

zhu et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that the eae gene is associated with a/e activity of o <dig> e. coli isolated from swine pwd. however, the aeec are less commonly associated with pwd than etec. in the present study, we found only one o45:h- isolate  positive for the eae gene. in accordance with our results, frydendahl  <cit>  and osek  <cit>  also found only 1%  and 3%  of danish and polish pwd isolates carrying the eae gene, respectively. f17-producing e. coli are commonly isolated from calves with or without diarrhoea  <cit> . in this study, the f <dig> gene was detected in three e. coli, two of which were also positive for f <dig>  enterotoxins, and east <dig> toxin. similarly, osek  <cit>  found that only four  of  <dig> isolates from pwd in poland were positive for f <dig> 

the role of east <dig> toxin in swine colibacillosis has not been demonstrated, however, the gene encoding east <dig> toxin is commonly found in isolates associated with pwd  <cit> . our results confirm these observations as we found that  <dig> of  <dig> isolates harbored asta gene and all f <dig> isolates were asta positive. the high frequency of the asta gene suggests the necessity of further studies to investigate the significance of this toxin in porcine pwd.

genotyping methods such as multilocus enzyme electrophoresis  and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  have been used for differentiation and epidemiological characterization of e. coli isolated from pigs with pwd and edema disease. pfge is a powerfull tool to reveal inter- and intra-serotype specific genetic differences among porcine pathogenic e. coli  <cit> . however, there are few studies reporting genetic relatedness of e. coli isolated from diarrhoea in pigs. osek  <cit>  used the pfge technique to analyze  <dig> e. coli from pigs with pwd, isolated from geographically separated farms in the western part of poland. the  <dig> isolates belonging to four serogroups  showed  <dig> different pfge profiles and although a high degree of polymorphism among different serotypes was observed, isolates belonging to the same serological group showed a close relationship. thus, the  <dig> isolates of serotype o149:k <dig> generated only two pfge types. in our study, a representative group of  <dig> etec and stec isolates revealed  <dig> distinct restriction profiles. although isolates of the same serotype were placed together in the dendrogram, high degree of polymorphism among certain serotypes was detected. thus,  <dig> distinct pfge profiles resulted from  <dig> o149:h <dig> isolates analyzed, in spite of the fact that  <dig> e. coli of those  <dig> carried the same virulence genes . similarly results have been found in spain among isolates of the most prevalent serotype  nowadays . further studies are necessary to know if some of these clusters have appeared recently, and if so, analyze its evolution, as well as if there is any relationship with pathogenicity in farms.

CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that in slovakia, as described in other countries, pathogenic e. coli isolates from pwd belong to a restricted number of serotypes and pathotypes. the etec serotype o149:h <dig> seems to be predominant, but also two new serotypes  not previously described in porcine etec and stec isolated in other countries are common. the f18ac and f <dig> fimbriae were the most prevalent colonization factors detected in postweaning e. coli in slovakia. macrorestriction analysis showed that, although isolates of the same serotype and virulence markers mainly share the same pfge group, there is a high genetic variation, especially among etec of o149:h <dig> serotype.
