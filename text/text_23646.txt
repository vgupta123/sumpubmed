BACKGROUND
in prokaryotes, biosynthesis of arginine from glutamate  is carried out by a series of eight enzymatic reactions initiated by acetylation of glutamate, a reaction catalysed by n-acetylglutamate synthase . this first step prevents glutamate from cyclisation and its further use in proline biosynthesis  <cit> . after metabolisation of n-acetylglutamate, biosynthesis proceeds via three enzymatic steps which form further acetylated intermediates, until the acetyl group is removed in the fifth step of this process. the resulting ornithine is carbamoylated to citrulline. addition of aspartate leads to n-argininosuccinate, which is finally converted to l-arginine  <cit> .

enzymes catalysing the formation of n-acetylglutamate in prokaryotes exhibit a high degree of diversity. n-acetylglutamate synthase activity was first discovered in escherichia coli <cit> . here, the two-domain protein arga contains a carbamate kinase domain at its n-terminus that is homologous to the next enzyme in arginine biosynthesis, n-acetylglutamate kinase   <cit> . the n-acetylglutamate synthase domain, as well as an acetyl-coa binding region, is located at the c-terminus of arga. this domain is related to the large family of gcn5-related acetyltransferases   <cit> . arga from e. coli is strongly feedback-inhibited by l-arginine, leading to 50% inhibition at  <dig>  mm  <cit> . coenzyme a and n-acetylglutamate also inhibit the activity of this enzyme:  <dig>  mm coa or 25 mm n-acetylglutamate both result in 50% inhibition of arga  <cit> . in e. coli, removal of the acetyl group is catalysed by arge  during the fifth step of arginine biosynthesis, which results in a linear pathway  <cit> .

for the acetylated intermediates, the majority of prokaryotes have a more efficient cyclic pathway in which argj  catalyses the acetylation of glutamate  <cit> . argj operates as a bifunctional protein and uses both substrates, acetyl-coa and n-acetylornithine, thus, this enzyme exhibits both nags and oat activity  <cit> . in this case, nags activity is essential for priming arginine biosynthesis, but it has only an anaplerotic function while most n-acetylglutamate is produced by argj using l-glutamate and n-acetylornithine as substrates. the acetyl group is recycled via transacetylation of l-glutamate. therefore the latter reaction is generally preferred, explaining the low abundance of nags enzymes in organisms exhibiting oat  <cit> .

regulation of this metabolic pathway is generally achieved through feedback inhibition of the second enzyme in the pathway, n-acetylglutamate kinase  by l-arginine  <cit>  and/ or by feedback inhibition of argj by l-ornithine  <cit> .

in most bacteria, either a bifunctional argj or arga is responsible for formation of n-acetylglutamate. however, there also exist some organisms such as neisseria gonorrhoeae <cit>  or bacillus stearothermophilus <cit>  exhibiting both a bifunctional oat as well as a nags gene. there are also oats which are unable to use acetyl-coa as substrate and are, therefore, designated as ‘monofunctional’. an additional nags gene is needed in this case, however, in organisms such as streptomyces coelicolor or thermus thermophilus, both encoding a monofunctional argj, no orthologue of arga can be identified by sequence similarity searches  <cit> . in these organisms, the glutamate acetylation mechanism remains unclear, however, in  <dig>  errey et al. discovered a novel arga protein in mycobacterium tuberculosis, containing only a single domain and consisting of  <dig> amino acids  <cit> . this “short nags” version  is a putative gnat-related enzyme and was later also found in other genera including thermus and streptomyces. the proteins of this family possess only  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids, similar to the length of the c-terminal acetyl-coa domain of classical nags, however, are able to complement e. coli arga mutants  <cit> .

in addition to single-domain s-nagss, another group of proteins exists in which a s-nags domain is fused with an n-argininosuccinase  domain, the protein that catalyses the last step of the l-arginine biosynthesis pathway. the argh genes were found mainly in marine bacteria of the alteromonas-vibrio group  <cit> . it is speculated that these s-nagss always require a complex formation with a protein partner providing an efficient glutamate binding site  <cit> .

corynebacterium glutamicum is a natural producer of l-glutamate, a precursor of l-arginine and, accordingly, its arginine biosynthesis has been the subject of intense research. the earliest studies of this organism were performed in  <dig> by udaka and kinoshita, who analysed the metabolic pathway of l-ornithine, an intermediate of the arginine pathway. the authors recognised that acetylated compounds form a cycle of reactions, in which the acetyl group is recycled by generation of n-acetylglutamate  <cit> . hence, it was concluded that c. glutamicum exhibits an oat activity catalysed by argj. in  <dig>  sakanyan et al. discovered the monofunctional action of argj by revealing its ability to complement e. coli arge but not arga mutants. by performing enzyme inhibition tests, they detected no influence on oat activity by l-arginine, however, a product inhibition was shown when 5 mm l-ornithine was added to the argj enzyme  <cit> .

nevertheless, argj lacks nags activity and so investigations to discover a glutamate acetylase responsible for the first step in arginine biosynthesis were performed. recently, hwang and cho  <cit> , who searched for c. glutamicum n-acetyltransferase genes complementing an auxotrophic ∆argj mutant, claimed that cg <dig>  demonstrates nags activity and that its overexpression leads to an increase in ornithine production. but shortly thereafter kind et al. <cit>  revealed that cg <dig> acetylates diaminopentane  instead of glutamate, so that the nags gene of c. glutamicum is still unknown.

in the work described here, we analysed arginine synthesis in c. glutamicum by individually mutating single genes known to be involved in this synthesis pathway and determining the patterns of accumulated metabolic intermediates. in a complementation approach, we identified a c. glutamicum gene able to complement an arginine-auxotrophic e. coli arga mutant. enzyme activity tests as well as metabolic profiling demonstrated that this gene is the functional analogue of arga in c. glutamicum.

RESULTS
arginine biosynthesis of c. glutamicum was an integral part of a number of previous studies which have elucidated detailed knowledge of the genetic and enzymatic organisation of this pathway  <cit> , its regulation by the transcriptional regulator argr, as well as the feedback inhibition of argb by the end-product of the pathway, l-arginine  <cit> . in order to complement the existing understanding of this pathway, we chose to characterise the metabolic intermediates of arginine metabolism using defined individual knock-out mutants of all known arginine biosynthesis genes located in the arginine operon  <cit> .

for this systematic metabolic study, auxotrophic mutants for each arginine biosynthetic gene of the arg-operon with an additional deletion of the transcriptional regulator of arginine biosynthesis  were constructed. the knockout of the transcriptional repressor argr led to transcriptional activation of the argr regulon, consisting of the arg-operon, its sub-operon arggh, and the carabpyrf-operon as demonstrated by microarray hybridization analysis . to ensure equal conditions, c. glutamicum atcc  <dig> and all mutants were cultivated in minimal media supplemented with l-arginine. by washing exponentially grown cells and transferring them into unsupplemented cgxii-medium, it is expected that auxotrophic strains starve and growth is arrested while the direct substrate of the removed enzyme should, therefore, accumulate, as has been shown in previous studies  <cit> . for detection of arginine biosynthesis intermediates, hydrophilic extracts were analysed by hplc-esi-qtof in positive ionisation mode. mean values for normalised peak areas of identified + ions of n-acetylglutamate, n-acetylglutamate semialdehyde, n-acetylornithine, ornithine, citrulline and n-argininosuccinate are depicted in figure  <dig>  n-acetylglutamyl phosphate was not detectable in any sample examined, which could be due to insufficient ionisation of this compound in positive mode. arginine was as well not detected in any sample as was expected for deletion mutants. for n-acetylglutamate semialdehyde, no reference substance was available. therefore, the respective + ion  was fragmented by applying automated ms/ms. the resulting spectrum was compared to a theoretical fragmentation pattern. the main fragment ion  can be explained by consecutive neutral losses of one molecule h <dig> and one acetyl group . after revision of full-scan ms data, + ion  and + ion  could be observed in chromatograms of ∆argrd, that co-eluted with + ion of n-acetylglutamate semialdehyde .

comparison of metabolite profiles of different arginine auxotrophic strains revealed that the intracellular intermediates n-acetylglutamate semialdehyde, ornithine and n-argininosuccinate were only accumulated in their corresponding mutant, namely in Δargrd, Δargrf, or Δargrh, respectively. however, citrulline was detected in samples of strains Δargrg, and Δargrh. the latter finding could indicate a backlog from n-argininosuccinate to citrulline or, alternatively, a low conversion rate of argininosuccinate synthetase. n-acetylornithine was also found in two of the mutants. a high pool size of this compound was observed in ∆argrj and a lower pool size in ∆argrf, which again might imply a backlog. the accumulation of n-acetylornithine in ∆argrj provides clear in vivo evidence for a nags activity in c. glutamicum, catalysed by at least one other enzyme than argj. former experiments performed by sakanyan et al. in  <dig> revealed that argj of c. glutamicum only exhibited monofunctional enzyme activity in vitro and in vivo <cit> .

n-acetylglutamate was the only metabolite intermediate detectable in the wildtype and in all mutants. as in the ∆argrj mutant, the n-acetylglutamate pool was significantly reduced in the ∆argrd strain, most probably due to the lack of substrate for transacetylation by argj. however, the relatively high n-acetylglutamate pool in the ∆argrc mutant is not directly explained by this.

discovering a gene responsible for the first step of arginine biosynthesis
for identification of a gene encoding the missing n-acetylglutamate synthase in c. glutamicum atcc  <dig>  an e. coli jm <dig> ∆arga mutant was constructed by using red/et recombination. after successful integration of the gene deletion cassette, the selection marker was removed by using flp recombination. the constructed mutant was tested on m <dig> minimal medium and no growth was observed without l-arginine supplementation. furthermore, arginine auxotrophy of this mutant was not complemented by argj from c. glutamicum, as described in literature  <cit> .

to discover a gene able to complement the auxotrophic e. coli ∆arga mutant, a genomic library of c. glutamicum atcc  <dig> was created. the procedure to create a dna library and its cloning in the shuttle expression vector pz8- <dig> are described in the methods section. e. coli ∆arga mutants were transformed with the plasmid library. after 48 h of growth, a single colony was obtained on minimal medium plates. the plasmid was isolated from this clone and the dna insert was sequenced. analysis of the nucleotide sequence revealed a 1631 bp large dna fragment of the c. glutamicum atcc  <dig> genome  <cit>  . the insert contained the 3’ part of gene cg <dig>  encoding a putative n-acetylglutamate synthase and the complete xtha gene  coding for exodeoxyribonuclease iii. since a protein with n-acetylglutamate synthase activity  was searched for, cg <dig> with its gnat-domain  was the promising candidate. although the dna fragment carried only around 800 bp of the 1008 bp cg3035-gene, a pfam database search  disclosed that the acetyltransferase domain of this protein is fully encoded on the cloned dna fragment.

the genomic organisation of cg <dig> revealed an operon structure together with cg <dig> <cit> , coding for def <dig>  a putative peptide deformylase, since coding sequences of these two genes share an 11 bp long overlap. moreover, this implies a co-regulation of both proteins by translational coupling. the gene product of cg <dig> is  <dig>  kda in size and possesses an acetyltransf_ <dig> -domain catalysing transfer of an acetyl group to its substrate  <cit> . a coenzyme a binding pocket is located upstream of the acetyltransferase domain. nevertheless, an experimental validation of cg <dig> protein function was necessary.

validating the gene function of cg <dig> by heterologous complementation, gene deletion, metabolome analyses, and enzyme assays
the complete open reading frame of cg <dig> was amplified from c. glutamicum wt genome by pcr and cloned into pz8- <dig> together with a consensus ribosome-binding site  of highly expressed genes  <cit> . arga from e. coli was treated similarly to serve as positive control. the resulting plasmids  were transformed into e. coli Δarga. as expected, arga from e. coli allowed growth of arginine-auxotrophic mutant on minimal medium plates without l-arginine supplementation. growth on minimal medium was also restored by cg <dig>  showing a functional complementation.

to test whether cg <dig> is involved in arginine biosynthesis in c. glutamicum, growth of the deletion mutant ∆cg <dig> was analysed on solid minimal medium without l-arginine supplementation and compared to the c. glutamicum wildtype . after 48 h at 30°c the mutant ∆cg <dig> exhibits poor growth on unsupplemented mm <dig> plates in comparison to the c. glutamicum wildtype, indicating a bradytrophy of the mutant due to arginine limitation. therefore, cg <dig> is required for full activity of arginine biosynthesis in c. glutamicum, but not essential.

to characterise the function of cg <dig> in vivo, we performed additional metabolic profiling experiments, in which we compared samples of the deletion mutant ∆cg <dig> and the overexpression strain wt pz8-1::cg <dig> with regard to potential acetylation products formed by cg <dig>  samples of c. glutamicum atcc  <dig>  and c. glutamicum wt pz8- <dig> served as controls, respectively. relative quantification of metabolites revealed a strong decrease of the n-acetylglutamate pool  in the deletion mutant ∆cg <dig> in comparison to the wildtype. in accordance to that, overexpression of cg <dig> led to an almost tenfold  increase of n-acetylglutamate , providing clear evidence for the ability of cg <dig> to perform the first step in arginine biosynthesis. interestingly, n-acetylglutamine was the only other n-acetylated amino acid detectable. this metabolite was previously reported to be produced by strains of the species c. glutamicum   <cit> . the n-acetylglutamine pools were almost identical in all four strains tested . in addition, relative quantifications of l-citrulline  and l-arginine  were performed. here, the pool of both metabolites significantly decreased in the ∆cg <dig> mutant  and significantly increased about twofold in wt pz8-1::cg <dig> . for lysine, an amino acid derived from aspartate, neither deletion nor overexpression of cg <dig> had an effect on the intracellular concentration . here, it must be mentioned that cg <dig> is not part of the argr regulon.

since n-acetylglutamate synthases display a high degree of specificity for acetyl-coa and l-glutamate as substrates  <cit> , enzyme assays with crude protein extracts were performed to measure the specific nags activity of cg <dig>  to test for specificity of the nags measurement, acetyl-coa was added as single substrate and no consumption of acetyl-coa was found . then, nags activities were determined in crude extracts of either c. glutamicum atcc  <dig> or the deletion mutant ∆cg <dig> carrying the empty overexpression vectors pz8- <dig> or pz8-1::cg <dig> . first, a residual nags activity in the absence of cg <dig> in the deletion mutant harbouring the empty vector was determined to be  <dig>  mu mg- <dig> protein. second, the endogenous nags activity specific for cg <dig> was calculated by subtracting the total nags activities of the deletion mutant from that of the wildtype. this was done for strains harbouring the empty vector and for strains with the overexpressed cg <dig> separately. the nags activities attributed to cg <dig> were similar at  <dig>  mu mg- <dig> protein or  <dig>  mu mg- <dig> protein, for vectors pz8- <dig> or pz8-1::cg <dig> respectively. third, the additional activity conferred by cg <dig> overexpression was  <dig>  mu mg- <dig> protein or  <dig>  mu mg- <dig> protein, respectively. this is a 16– <dig> fold increase in activity and can be attributed to the multicopy effect as well as the strong promoter of the expression vector.

in addition, nags activities of overexpressed arga of e. coli and argj of c. glutamicum were measured in the wildtype background. as expected, argj exhibited no specific nags activity, explaining its inability to complement the e. coli ∆arga mutant. arga from e. coli was found to confer additional nags activity of approximately  <dig>  mu mg- <dig> protein.

for a number of microorganisms, including e. coli <cit> , salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium  <cit> , pseudomonas aeruginosa <cit> , and saccharomyces cerevisiae <cit> , a strong feedback inhibition of nags activity by l-arginine was found. therefore, inhibition studies of cg <dig> with l-arginine and also with the intermediate l-ornithine were performed. no changes in specific nags activity of the crude extract of c. glutamicum atcc  <dig> pz8-1::cg <dig> were detected when up to 50 mm l-ornithine or l-arginine was added to the reaction mixture .

cg <dig> establishes a novel class of nags genes
to determine how related cg <dig> is to other known nags genes, comparisons between “classical” arga proteins, bifunctional argj, s-nags and argo from campylobacter jejuni <cit>  were performed by sequence similarity-based searches with the cg <dig> protein sequence using the basic local alignment search tool   <cit>  at the ncbi. cg <dig> did not show significant overall sequence similarities to members of other classes. sequence similarity is restricted to the acetyltransferase catalytic domain, being distantly related to that of arga from e. coli , argj from bacillus subtilis  and the s-nags form from m. tuberculosis . no such similarity was found to argo from c. jejuni. since only the gcn5-related n-acetyltransferase  domain was found to be conserved, and gnat-domains can be found in n-acetyltransferases belonging to many different functional classes  <cit> , it is apparent that cg <dig> represents a novel nags class.

to identify related sequences and structures of cg <dig>  blastp  <cit>  with cg <dig> was used as query against the refseq database to identify all similar proteins, resulting in  <dig> hits including the query. the set of results was then filtered retaining only those  <dig> proteins with at least 25% sequence similarity over 80% of the length of cg <dig>  for reasons of clarity, all hits against non-actinobacteria  and poorly defined species  were excluded. for the same reason, for species with multiple sequenced strains  only one sequence was selected for further analysis, preferably from the type strain, if available. the remaining  <dig> sequences were aligned using cobalt  <cit>  and a fast-minimum-evolution tree was built . based on this tree, it is apparent that there are two distinct groups of possible orthologues: one containing only sequences  from the suborder corynebacterineae  and one comprised of representatives  from other suborders of the actinomycetales, mostly streptomycineae .

additional support for these two groups of orthologues can be derived from an analysis of the genomic context: in corynebacterineae , possible cg <dig> orthologues are strongly associated with def <dig>  encoding peptide deformylase, and xtha, encoding exodeoxyribonuclease iii . in contrast, the possible orthologue is often located adjacent to a gene encoding a ferredoxin in the second group. therefore, only the sequences of the most likely orthologues, the  <dig> from corynebacterineae, were realigned using cobalt and the location of the putative n-acyltransferase domain  was marked .

discussion
metabolite profiling analyses provide new insight into arginine biosynthesis
in the experiments described here, a systematic approach was performed using defined deletion mutants of c. glutamicum that were expected to accumulate intracellular metabolites. no stable isotope labelled internal standards for correction of ion suppression effects were used in these experiments, therefore, only a qualitative analysis of changes in metabolite pools could be performed. six out of seven intermediates of arginine biosynthesis were found with the applied hplc-esi-qtof method and the results provide new insights concerning metabolism within the arginine pathway. interestingly, two metabolites accumulated in different mutants – n-acetylornithine was found in the two mutants Δargrj and Δargrf, and citrulline accumulated in Δargrg and Δargrh mutants. in both cases, there was not only an accumulation in the mutant which was defective in the subsequent metabolic reaction, however, also in the strain with an inability to perform the second next reaction. this could indicate a backlog from the accumulated metabolite to its precursor.

n-acetylornithine was accumulated in ∆argrj, which confirmed its anticipated function as ornithine acetyl transferase . the measurements of intracellular n-acetylglutamate confirmed this role by demonstrating a strongly reduced pool in the ∆argrj mutant. for organisms having such a cyclic arginine pathway, this decrease illustrates a preference for transacetylation by argj instead of using the less economic arga activity to produce n-acetylglutamate  <cit> .

since no transacetylation should occur in mutants upstream of argj the behavior of ∆argrd mutant is consistent with a low intracellular n-acetylglutamate pool. it is puzzling, however, that in the ∆argrc mutant the n-acetylglutamate pool is similar to the ∆argrb mutant and the wildtype. in ∆argrb the accumulation of n-acetylglutamate can be explained by the interruption of biosynthesis. the unexpected high n-acetylglutamate pool in ∆argrc can either be interpreted by an equilibrium of the reaction catalysed by argb on the side of n-acetylglutamate or by a possible instability of the phosphorylated n-acetylglutamate and its breakdown to n-acetylglutamate. in the wildtype, the feedback inhibition of argb is the possible cause for accumulation of n-acetylglutamate.

in vivo and in vitro experiments confirm the ability of cg <dig> to acetylate l-glutamate
in this study, the function of cg <dig> to use acetyl-coa for acetylation of glutamate was demonstrated in vivo and in vitro. besides complementation of the auxotrophic e. coli ∆arga mutant, overexpression of cg <dig> led to a higher amount of intracellular n-acetylglutamate, whereas deletion of this gene resulted in a reduction of the intracellular n-acetylglutamate pool. from in vitro enzyme assays using crude extracts it was shown that nags enzyme activity also correlated well with the genotype regarding cg <dig>  l-glutamate most probably is the preferred amino acid substrate for cg <dig>  interestingly, the s-nags variant in m. tuberculosis has a higher activity with l-glutamine  <cit> . indeed, n-acetylglutamine was found in all c. glutamicum strains tested, but in levels unaffected by the presence or absence of cg <dig>  since no other n-acetylated amino acids were found in our metabolome analyses of c. glutamicum, this indicates that an involvement of cg <dig> in n-acetylglutamine synthesis is unlikely. on the other hand, the correspondence in the pools of n-acetylglutamate to those of the amino acids l-citrulline and l-arginine further strengthens the functional assignment of cg <dig> as integral part of arginine biosynthesis.

cg <dig> – a novel form of n-acetylglutamate synthase
the protein encoded by cg <dig> can be compared to known nags enzyme classes. four different kinds of nags enzyme families were described until now  <cit> , however, cg <dig> fits into none of them. different from classical known n-acetylglutamate synthases found, for example in e. coli, cg <dig> has only a single protein domain. with a length of  <dig> amino acids, it is shorter than the classical arga, although it is larger than the 150– <dig> amino acids long s-nags found, for example, in m. tuberculosis.

homologues of the cg <dig> protein were found in other corynebacteria as well as in diverse members of the suborder corynebacterineae, such as in rhodococcus spp., nocardia spp., or mycobacterium spp. analysis of the genomic context revealed a conserved arrangement of three genes encoding peptide deformylase, n-acetylglutamate synthase, and exodeoxyribonuclease iii among the fully sequenced genomes of this bacterial suborder. although no functional relationship of these genes is apparent, the conserved genomic context strengthens the view that cg <dig> and its closely similar sequences in the other species of the corynebacterineae represent true orthologues  <cit> .

it is unclear what the evolutionary driving forces were for the formation of the different nags protein families. the dissimilarity of nags proteins was noted before and attributed to an independent evolution or a more rapid evolution leading to much higher divergence than the sequences of other arginine biosynthesis proteins  <cit> .

since the growth behaviour experiment on minimal medium revealed a bradytrophy of ∆cg <dig> compared to the wildtype, this indicates that there is at least one other enzyme which is able to perform acetylation of glutamate in c. glutamicum atcc  <dig>  candidates for this are proteins with acetyltransferase domains. besides cg <dig>  eight other proteins with acetyltransferase domains are found in c. glutamicum, however, these have yet to be characterised.

it could be, however, that cg <dig> is not involved exclusively in arginine biosynthesis. this is not only indicated by the conserved arrangement of cg <dig> with genes involved in peptide or rna processing. the lack of transcriptional repression of cg <dig> by argr and feedback inhibition of cg <dig> by one of the products of arginine biosynthesis, arginine or ornithine also suggests such a role. the initial transacetylation step is a common target to control arginine metabolism, indeed, all previously known microbial nags enzymes are feedback-inhibited by arginine. it is well possible that n-acetylglutamate is a non-exclusive precursor of arginine biosynthesis, however, is also involved in other biosynthesis pathways. although it is not known what these biosynthetic pathways produce, the occurrence of n-acetylglutamine  <cit>  is an indication for hitherto unknown pathways in corynebacteria in which n-acetylglutamate could play a role. consequently, in c. glutamicum, argb would then be the first enzyme of the arginine specific pathway and is feedback-inhibited by l-arginine  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we investigated the metabolites of arginine biosynthesis in targeted biosynthetic mutants of c. glutamicum. through these investigations, we have found evidence for a missing enzyme which performs the first step of this process, the acetylation of glutamate catalysed by an n-acetylglutamate synthase.

by complementation of an auxotrophic e. coli ∆arga mutant with genomic dna of c. glutamicum, the gene cg <dig> was implicated as the enzyme responsible for this acetylation. a deletion of this gene led to a partial arginine auxotrophy and further experiments on genetic, enzymatic, and metabolomic levels demonstrated the ability of its encoded protein to act as nags, using acetyl-coa for acetylation of glutamate. these findings added significantly to the knowledge on arginine metabolism in c. glutamicum. the nags enzyme cg <dig> establishes a novel class of n-acetylglutamate synthases with orthologues found exclusively in members of the suborder corynebacterineae. therefore, we propose to name this novel class of nags containing cg <dig> and its apparent orthologues c-nags . this is simply a proposal, and it would be interesting to analyse in future studies if these orthologous candidates demonstrate functional catalysis of the same reaction.
