BACKGROUND
resistin, a novel adipocyte-secreted hormone, has gained attention for its involvement in insulin resistance in obesity and diabetes mellitus  <cit> . in murine animals, resistin is secreted from mature white adipocytes and decreases insulin sensitivity, whereas in humans it is mainly secreted from immune cells such as macrophages and monocytes and organs such as the spleen and bone marrow  <cit> . recently, several groups have reported a close relationship between resistin and inflammation. resistin increases the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α  and interleukin - <dig>  both of which are important for t cell development, through the regulation of nf-κb signaling pathway in human macrophages  <cit> . in the clinical setting, high levels of resistin expression are present in patients with rheumatoid arthritis  <cit> .

forkhead box p <dig> , a key regulator of the development of regulatory t cells , is a hallmark of tregs  <cit> , which exhibit a suppressive response to the effector function of cd4+ t cells  <cit> . two types of tregs have been reported: natural tregs , which naturally occur in the thymus, and inducible tregs , which can be induced from naïve t cells. the itregs exhibit less suppressive function to effector t cell responses than ntregs  <cit> . interleukin -  <dig>  transforming growth factor-β  and ligands for the activation of t cell receptors  have been reported as important factors in the induction of tregs from naïve t cells  <cit> .

dendritic cells  play a vital role in the modulation and activation of t cells, not only for the delivery and presentation of antigenic determinant to t cells, but also in the induction of differentiation of naïve t cells into t cells subtypes via cytokine secretion and/or cell-to-cell contact  <cit> . recently, several studies have reported that dcs are closely involved in the differentiation of tregs. for example, dcs either secreting tgf-β or in the presence of tgf-β induce differentiation of cd4+cd25+foxp3+ tregs  <cit> . interferon regulatory factor- <dig> -/- dcs enhance the suppressive ability of tregs and cause tolerogenic features via induction of tregs due to the fact that the irf-1-/- dcs secrete more il- <dig> and tgf-β but less il- <dig>  il-12p <dig> and ifn-γ than wild type dcs  <cit> .

we previously reported that resistin impairs the ability of human monocyte-derived dcs to uptake antigens and produce cytokines . these impaired dcs negatively regulate t cell responses such as proliferation of and differentiation into th <dig> cells  <cit> . in the current study, we further examine the ability of dcs treated with resistin to induce expansion of tregs.

methods
reagents
human recombinant resistin, endotoxin level less than  <dig>  ng/μg, was purchased from peprotech . to provide the effects of irrelevant control, we transformed recombinant resistin to heat-inactivated resistin through incubation with 100°c for  <dig> min. rpmi- <dig> glutamax medium, fetal bovine serum  and antibiotics  were purchased from invitrogen .

preparation of human monocyte-derived dcs and cd4+ t cells
pbmcs were isolated by density gradient centrifugation  using ficoll-paque plus . all experiments involving human blood were approved by the institutional review board of seoul national university . cd14+ monocytes or cd4+ t cells  were isolated from pbmcs using magnetic bead-based positive selection with a kit . cd14+ monocytes were suspended in complete media consisting of rpmi- <dig> glutamax medium supplemented with 10% fbs and  <dig> mm sodium pyruvate,  <dig> u/ml penicillin and  <dig> μg/ml streptomycin. to generate immature dcs, isolated cd14+ monocytes were cultured with  <dig> u/ml of hril- <dig> and  <dig> u/ml of hrgm-csf  for  <dig> days with a change of media every  <dig> days.

rna isolation and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction 
cells were lysed with  <dig> ml of trizol  and  <dig> μl of chloroform was added. the tubes were shaken gently and incubated for  <dig> min at room temperature. the tubes were centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for  <dig> min and the aqueous phase containing rna was transferred into a new tube. after transfer,  <dig>  ml of isopropanol was added to the rna solution, mixed by gentle inversion, and then incubated for  <dig> min at room temperature. the suspended rna was precipitated by centrifugation at  <dig>  × g for  <dig> min. the supernatant was discarded and the rna pellet was washed with 75% ethanol followed by centrifugation at  <dig> × g for  <dig> min. the supernatant was discarded and the rna pellet was re-suspended in nuclease-free water.

isolated total rna was reverse-transcribed into cdna with oligo-dt primers . the cdna was amplified by pcr in a total volume of  <dig> μl containing  <dig>  units of taq polymerase and two picomoles of specific primers for human foxp <dig>  tgf-β, irf- <dig>  il-12p <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  ctla- <dig> or β-actin . pcr was performed in a thermal cycler  with pre-denaturation at 94°c for  <dig> min, followed by  <dig> cycles of denaturation at 94°c for  <dig> sec, annealing at the appropriate annealing temperature  for  <dig> sec and extension at 72°c for  <dig> min, and finished with an additional elongation step for  <dig> min at 72°c. amplified pcr products were separated by electrophoresis using a 2% agarose gel containing  <dig> μg/ml ethidium bromide. to quantitate the expression of each mrna, the ratio of each mrna to β-actin was measured using multi-gauge software .

RESULTS
resistin induces expression of foxp <dig> in pbmc, but not in cd4+ t cells
to examine whether resistin could modulate the induction of tregs, we tested the expression level of foxp <dig> in pbmcs and cd4+ t cells. foxp <dig> is one of the most representative markers of tregs, together with ctla <dig>  tgf-β and il- <dig>  <cit> . since foxp <dig> is expressed in t cells only, pbmcs and cd4+ t cells were incubated with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> ng/ml of resistin for  <dig> hrs. the expression level of foxp <dig> was then measured by rt-pcr. the expression of foxp <dig> increased significantly  in a dose-dependent manner in pbmcs treated with resistin . minimal, if any, change was found in the expression of tgf-β . it is to note that the expression level of foxp <dig> and tgf-β was, unexpectedly, not changed in cd4+ t cells treated with any concentration of resistin . these results suggest that the resistin-induced expression of foxp <dig> in tregs is mediated by indirect where cd4+ cells are not necessarily required.

resistin-treated dcs enhance the expansion of tregs
the primary role of dcs is to interact with t cells and trigger adaptive immune responses, but dcs are also involved in the differentiation of tregs  <cit> . therefore, to further examine whether resistin-treated dcs are involved in the regulation of tregs, cd4+ t cells and dcs were co-cultured and concomitantly treated with resistin. mrna expression levels of tgf-β, ctla- <dig> and foxp <dig>  representative markers of tregs, were subsequently measured. the expression of tgf-β, ctla- <dig> and foxp <dig> was greater in cells treated with resistin than those without resistin treatment . this finding was further confirmed by changes of cd4+ cd25+ foxp3+ tregs using flow cytometry. as shown in figure 2b , cd4+ cd25+ foxp3+ cells were significantly  higher in cells treated with resistin than those without treatment . and, to confirm whether the increased number of tregs were induced from naïve cd4+ t cells or expanded from tregs, cd4+ cd25- naïve t cells were co-cultured and concomitantly treated with resistin. the result showed that cd25+ foxp3+ tregs were expanded from tregs but were merely induced from cd4+ cd25- naïve t cells when co-cultured with resistin-treated dcs . finally, cd4+ cd25+ t cells were isolated after co-culture of t cells and dcs concomitantly treated with/without resistin in order to examine their functional capacity to suppress the activity of effector t cells. cd4+ cd25- t cells labeled with cfse were co-cultured with cd4+ cd25+ t cells and stimulated with anti-human cd <dig> and cd <dig> antibodies. when compared with a proliferation of cd4+ cd25- naïve t cells only, the cd4+ cd25+ tregs induced by dcs treated with resistin suppressed the proliferation of cd4+ cd25- naïve t cells similar to cd4+ cd25+ t cells induced by dcs without resistin . these results suggest that resistin modulates the functionality of dcs to enhance the expansion of cd4+ cd25+ foxp3+ tregs.

the effects of resistin in dcs for expansion of tregs
next, we examined the change of irf- <dig> and cytokines, il-12p <dig>  il-23p <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig> and tgf-β in relation to the differentiation of t cells. irf- <dig> both, at mrna  and protein level  was suppressed in a time- and dose-dependent manner when dcs were treated with resistin.  note that heat-inactivated resistin was used. it has been previously shown that the expression of inflammatory cytokines, tnf-α, ifn-γ, il-12p <dig> and il- <dig>  was significantly reduced while the expression of tolerogenic cytokines, il- <dig> and tgf-β, was increased in dcs from irf-/- mice  <cit> . il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> are known to be involved in the differentiation of naïve t cells into th <dig> and th <dig> subtypes, respectively, while il- <dig> and tgf-β induce the differentiation of tr <dig> and th <dig> subtypes, respectively  <cit> . accordingly, we further examined the expression of il-12p <dig>  il-23p <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig> and tgf-β in dcs after resistin treatment. the expression of il-12p <dig>  il-23p <dig> and il- <dig> decreased in dcs treated with resistin, while no significant differences were observed in the expression of il- <dig> and tgf-β . and through the pi/annexin v, cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig> and mhc class ii staining, we confirmed that resistin is involved in the process of neither apoptosis nor maturation of dcs . these results suggest that resistin suppresses the expression of il-12p <dig>  il-23p <dig> and il- <dig> through the regulation of irf- <dig> induction in dcs.

tregs were induced by tgf-β secreted by themselves but not by dcs treated with resistin
to investigate whether tgf-β secreted from dcs is involved in the induction of tregs, cd4+ t cells were pre-treated with tgf-β receptor inhibitor, co-cultured with dcs, and concomitantly treated with resistin. tregs were induced when the cells were treated with resistin as expected, but treatment with tgf-β receptor inhibitor suppressed such induction . we also examined the level of tgf-β in the culture supernatant. tgf-β increased in cd4+ t cells when co-cultured with dcs and treated with resistin . the expression of tgf-β mrna was not significantly different in dcs alone treated with resistin . these results suggest that tgf-β produced from cd4+ t cells co-cultured with dcs together with resistin treatment, was the major source to induce the differentiation of tregs, rather than tgf-β secreted from dcs.

discussion
the major findings of this study are as follow:  resistin indirectly induced the expression of foxp <dig> in pbmcs,  resistin suppressed the expression of irf- <dig>  il- <dig>  il-12p <dig> and il-23p <dig> in dcs,  dcs treated with resistin enhanced the expansion of cd4+ cd25+ foxp3+ t cells,  tgf-β caused the expansion of tregs and  tgf-β was mainly produced from tregs during the co-culture of t cells and dcs together with resistin treatment.

resistin was originally described because of its promotion of resistance against the insulin response  <cit>  and adipogenesis in fat tissue  <cit> . more recently, important roles of resistin in the human immune response  <cit>  and inflammation, including induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines,  <cit>  have been reported. in the previous study, we reported the immunomodulatory effect of resistin on human dcs for the first time  <cit> . we have demonstrated that resistin impairs not only the ability of antigen-uptake and cytokine production in dcs, but also the proliferation and differentiation of t cells. these results suggest that the dcs treated with resistin may negatively regulate the effector function of t cells. our findings are in agreement with those of rutella et al., who also reported that tolerogenic dcs, known to express high amounts of il- <dig> but not il- <dig> in the immature state, induce tregs  <cit> . it is to note that tregs are well known for their role in suppressing a variety of t cell responses. tregs also regulate dcs and nk cells by suppressing expression of the ccr <dig> ligand and il-15rα, respectively  <cit> . accordingly, we hypothesized that resistin could be involved in the expansion of tregs through the regulation of dcs.

in order to clarify whether resistin could induce the expansion of tregs, we treated pbmcs and purified cd4+ t cells with resistin and analyzed the changes in foxp <dig> expression. resistin had no direct effect on the induction of foxp <dig> mrna expression in cd4+ t cells, but did increase foxp <dig> mrna in pbmcs. this result suggests that resistin may indirectly induce tregs through the regulation of other cell types, most likely dcs. tregs can be induced by cell-to-cell contact, for instance, dcs and t cells. dcs, producing tgf-β, il- <dig> and indoleamine  <dig> -dioxygenase can induce the differentiation of tregs in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . since immature dcs have a better ability to induce tregs than mature dcs  <cit> , we examined changes in the expressin of dc maturation markers  following resistin treatment . we found no evidence for the involvement of resistin in the maturation of dcs, implying that the induction of tregs is independent of dc maturation.

we further demonstrated that resistin suppressed the expression of irf- <dig> and cytokines such as il- <dig>  il-12p <dig> and il-23p <dig> in dcs, suggesting the possibility that resistin-treated dcs are involved in the induction of tregs. indeed, il- <dig> enhances the conversion of th <dig> cells to tregs when combined with tgf-β, whereas it inhibits leukemia inhibitory factor , which is an essential factor for inducing foxp <dig> expression in tregs  <cit> . on the other hand, il- <dig> is known as one of the most important cytokines for inducing differentiation of naïve t cells into th <dig> cells  <cit> . il-23p <dig> is well known as the important source to induce th <dig> cells  <cit> . therefore, these decrease of effect cytokines support the enhancing expansion of tregs.

the down-regulation of irf in our findings is supported by a previous study in irf-1-/- mice, which have high levels of cd4+cd25+foxp3+ tregs, where the expression of foxp <dig> was negatively regulated by irf- <dig>  <cit> . we found that the expression of foxp <dig> and ctla- <dig> increased in parallel with the suppressive effect of tregs when cd4+ t cells were co-cultured with dcs in the presence of resistin.

it has been shown that suppressors of cytokine signaling  3-deficient dcs, together with impaired production of cytokines  and co-stimulatory molecules , preferentially induce the expansion of tregs  <cit> . our results also suggest that resistin decreases the production of socs <dig> in dcs . tregs can be induced by soluble factors, including tgf-β, il <dig> and il- <dig>  tgf-β, in particular, suppresses inflammatory activity and promotes differentiation of tregs  <cit> . accordingly, we examined the source of tgf-β that provoked the expansion of tregs. we found that major source of tgf-β required for the induction of tregs was cd4+ t cells co-cultured with dcs in the presence of resistin, and not dcs themselves treated with resistin. it is to note that the treatment with tgf-β or supernatant from any culture condition aforementioned had no impact on the expansion of tregs . therefore it is most likely that in addition to tgf-β produced from co-culture of cd4+ t cells and dcs in the presence of resistin, cell to-cell contact is critically required for the induction of tregs.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that resistin induces the expansion of regulatory t cells through regulating the expression of irf- <dig> and its target cytokines, il- <dig>  il-23p <dig> and il-12p <dig> in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells.
