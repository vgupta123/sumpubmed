BACKGROUND
red clover is widely cultivated in most temperate regions of the world as a forage legume and as green manure. red clover is an outcrossing species, with a diploid genome  of approximately  <dig> mb  <cit> . currently, three genetic linkage maps have been published for red clover. the first linkage map, containing  <dig> loci over a total length of  <dig>  cm, was constructed in  <dig> by isobe et al.  <cit>  using rflp markers derived from red clover cdnas. a high-density linkage map containing  <dig> loci over a total length of  <dig>  cm was developed in  <dig> by sato et al. using primarily microsatellite markers  <cit> . in  <dig>  herrmann et al. reported an aflp and microsatellite-based map containing  <dig> loci over a total length of  <dig>  cm  <cit> .

because red clover has a strong gametophytic incompatibility system, the present varieties have developed mainly by mass selection, recurrent selection and natural selection  <cit> . the use of breeding methods that improve specific traits while maintaining genetic diversity in a variety of red clover has resulted in abundant intra-population genetic diversity  <cit> . this high level of genetic diversity in red clover is also evident in polymorphism analyses using rflp, aflp and microsatellite markers  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  while it is highly probable that the dna markers of the three currently available red clover linkage maps are transferable across random germplasms, it is also likely that a locus position on a random red clover germplasm will be shifted from its original position in the mapping population due to segregation distortion or chromosome rearrangement. in previous linkage map studies, subsets of rflp and microsatellite markers were used to determine the correspondence between linkage groups, but data related to the stability of locus positions in each linkage group was not reported.

for several crop species, such as maize  <cit> , soybean  <cit> , barley  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  grapevine  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and lettuce  <cit> , integrated consensus linkage maps that combine information from multiple mapping populations have been developed. these maps are generally constructed with the aim of determining the relative position of transferable markers, increasing the number of available dna markers, obtaining saturated maps and comparing the locations of quantitative trait loci  and candidate genes of interest across germplasms. similarly, the construction of a consensus linkage map for red clover should enable us to determine the stability of locus positions across random red clover germplasms, as well as increase the number of loci in the linkage map.

in addition to the construction of informative linkage maps, genome-wide polymorphism analysis has been a recent focus in qtl detection and genomics-based, marker-assisted breeding in an attempt to harness the genomic diversity of a targeted species  <cit> . in red clover, herrmann et al.  identified  <dig> candidate qtl relating to seed yield components using a f <dig> mapping population  <cit> . however, there have been no reports identifying qtl based on the diverse genetic variation in red clover germplasms. investigation of genome-wide polymorphisms, along with the construction of consensus map positions of each marker, is integral to our ability to carry out genetic analyses of red clover, a species that exhibits a high level of genetic diversity.

in the current study, we developed a consensus linkage map for red clover that integrates dna markers from three previously reported maps with segregation data from six mapping populations, including three newly generated populations. by comparing the locus order on the consensus map and each accession-specific map, we were able to estimate the robustness and saturability of the consensus linkage map. in addition, genome-wide allele frequencies in  <dig> red clover individuals, derived from  <dig> varieties/lines from different regions of the world and parents of mapping populations, were estimated using  <dig> microsatellite loci randomly chosen from the consensus map.

RESULTS
construction of a consensus genetic linkage map
a total of  <dig> markers, including  <dig> microsatellite,  <dig> aflp,  <dig> rflp and  <dig> random amplified polymorphic dnas  markers, and  <dig> sequence tagged site  marker, were used for the construction of a linkage map. a total of  <dig> genotypes were generated from  <dig> mapping populations representing  <dig> red clover parental accessions . the largest data sets were from the parental accession hr, followed by r <dig>  and were derived from hr × r <dig> crosses. the polymorphism ratio of  <dig> bridging microsatellite markers, which were previously developed for hr × r <dig> or pc × pv crosses, ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> % in the other parental accessions.

a)a total of  <dig> bridging microsatellite markers were selected from the hr × r <dig> and pc × pv maps.

the integrated red clover map was composed of  <dig> loci  in seven linkage groups . a total of  <dig> loci detected by  <dig> bridging microsatellite markers allowed the integration of the  <dig> individual segregation data sets into a consensus linkage map. marker information, including position on the consensus map, marker type and bridging marker are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  the total length of the consensus map was  <dig>  cm,  <dig>  cm of which were covered by the bridging microsatellite markers . the length of the linkage groups ranged from  <dig>  cm  to  <dig>  cm , and  <dig> %  to  <dig> %  of each linkage group was covered by bridging markers. the average distance between loci was  <dig>  cm, and ranged from  <dig>  cm  to  <dig>  cm . the largest gap between two loci was approximately  <dig>  cm, between c <dig>  and tpssr <dig>  in lg <dig>  and between rcs <dig>  and rcs <dig>  in lg <dig>  locus density tended to be lower in the distal regions of each linkage group .

b) parenthesis show the number of loci detected by the bridge microsatellite markers.

c) parenthesis show the range of marker density.

d) markers those generated multiple loci were excluded from the calculation.

on the consensus map,  <dig> microsatellite markers  and  <dig> rflp markers  generated multiple loci . the average number of loci per microsatellite and rflp marker was  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the range of loci per microsatellite marker  was smaller than the range of loci per rflp marker . each locus detected by identical microsatellite markers mapped to a multi-linkage group, while multiple loci detected by identical rflp markers did not always map to multi-linkage groups.

comparison of accession-specific linkage maps and the consensus map
the total number of loci on the accession specific maps ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . the ratio of mapped to analyzed loci differed depending on the population. ns <dig> and h17l exhibited higher ratios , while  <dig> and wf <dig> exhibited lower ratios . the length of each accession-specific map differed, ranging from  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm, but none of the accession maps exceeded the length of the consensus map. the segregation distortion ratio of the tested markers and mapped loci on the accession-specific maps ranged from  <dig> %  to  <dig> % , and from  <dig> %  to  <dig> % , respectively . the parents of the  <dig> × wf <dig> cross exhibited the two highest segregation distortion ratios for tested markers, while r <dig> exhibited the highest segregation distortion ratio for mapped loci. h17l exhibited the lowest segregation distortion ratio for both tested markers and mapped loci. segregation distortion was randomly observed across linkage groups . however, the segregation distortion ratio of each linkage group varied, and the most distorted linkage group differed among the accessions . for example, lg <dig> exhibited the highest segregation distortion ratio among all linkage groups on pc-specific  and wf1680-specific  maps, whereas it exhibited the lowest segregation distortion ratio on the h17l-specific map .

locus order was well conserved between the consensus map and accession-specific maps for all linkage groups , with the exception of loci in lg <dig> of the wf <dig> map, which did not correlate significantly  with the consensus map . lg <dig> and lg <dig> exhibited a slightly scrambled locus order between the consensus map and the accession-specific maps. the loci on 110– <dig> cm of lg <dig> in the hr-specific map were not located at the corresponding positions of the consensus map . the locus density in the distal regions of the accession-specific maps tended to be lower than in the proximal regions, as was observed for the consensus map.

** and * indicates p <  <dig>  and p <  <dig> , respectively.

genome-wide allele frequency in red clover germplasms
the genome-wide allele frequencies of  <dig> microsatellite loci randomly mapped onto the consensus map were estimated based on the number of alleles and pic for  <dig> red clover individuals originating from  <dig> varieties and hr, r <dig>  ns <dig> and h17l. the list of loci is presented in additional file 1: table s <dig>  prior to estimating allele frequency, population structure was estimated using structure ver. <dig>  software. statistics were computed for k =  <dig> to  <dig>  where k represents the number of subpopulations, and the maximum p value representing the allele-frequency divergence among subpopulations was distributed from  <dig>   to  <dig>  . the results were indicative of the absence of population structure in the  <dig> red clover individuals.

the number of alleles generated for each locus ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  with an average value of  <dig> , and pic ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , with an average value of  <dig>  . the average pic value for each linkage group in the consensus map ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . pic values varied among linkage groups .

discussion
there are currently no generally accepted standards for defining or naming integrated linkage maps. as a result, integrated maps are alternately referred to as consensus, composite, pooled, comprehensive, reference or integrated maps, depending on the integration procedure and characteristics, as well as the reason for generating the map  <cit> . in the current study, we constructed an integrated linkage map for red clover using a regression mapping algorithm of joinmap ver. <dig>  which is based on mean recombination frequencies, and combined multiple segregation data sets  <cit> . the order of the mapped loci was generally well conserved between the integrated map and the accession-specific maps, which indicated that the positions of the loci on the present integrated map can be regarded as the "consensus" positions. for this reason, we have termed our integrated map a "consensus map".

the average distance between loci and total length of the consensus map were  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm, respectively. our consensus map had a higher locus density and was slightly shorter than a previously reported saturated linkage map , in which the average distance between loci and total length were  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm, respectively  <cit> . the lengths of the hr-specific and r130-specific maps reconstructed in this study were  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm, respectively, and were shorter in length than previously reported maps. based on these results, we conclude that the red clover consensus map developed in the current study is saturated, and that the mapping algorithm used to generate the map likely has a slight influence on the total length. however, there were still several gaps in the distal regions of the linkage groups, as observed by visual inspection. the results of genome-wide pic assessment suggested that there are no clear differences in allelic polymorphisms across the genomes. therefore, the reduced locus density in distal regions may be due to other factors, such as the structural features of the chromosomes, or alternatively, statistical issues. one of the largest gaps in the map was  <dig>  cm , in lg <dig>  lg <dig> corresponds to chromosome  <dig>  which has been shown by fluorescence in situ hybridization  to include large regions on the short arm that hybridize with 28s rdna  <cit> . the presence of this large hybridization region might prevent or hamper the identification of polymorphic markers in this region, leading to an apparent lower locus density in the upper region of lg <dig> 

the quality of the genotyping data is a critical element in linkage analysis  <cit> . a three percent error rate in genotyping can double the genetic map length  <cit> . in the current study, the total length of the consensus map was  <dig>  cm, and bridging markers covered  <dig>  cm of the linkage map, which suggests that the distal regions of the linkage groups were not well covered by bridging markers. thus, reduced multiple segregation data or a genotyping error might be more factors contributing to the lower locus density in the distal regions of the linkage groups.

segregation distortion was observed across the linkage groups. the distortion ratios of the tested markers, as well as for mapped loci, were different among the red clover accessions. for the tested markers, wf <dig> and  <dig> exhibited the highest distortion ratio, nearly  <dig>  times higher than that of h17l, which exhibited the lowest distortion ratio. however, many of the skewed loci in wf <dig> and  <dig> were excluded during the mapping procedure, and as a result, r <dig> exhibited the highest segregation distortion ratio for mapped loci. the segregation distortion ratios of each linkage group varied widely in each accession, and interestingly, the most skewed linkage group differed according to accession-specific map. these results suggest that segregation distortion in red clover can occur anywhere in the genome, in an accession-specific manner.

locus order was generally well conserved; however, the robustness of the locus order differed slightly depending on the linkage group and the accession-specific linkage map. the weakest correlations of locus order between the consensus map and an accession-specific map were for lg <dig> and lg <dig> in the wf1680-specific map. wf <dig> exhibited the lowest polymorphic ratio of bridging markers, which might be due to the close genetic distance between the two haplotype genomes in wf <dig>  the close genetic distance between the two haplotype genomes might also explain the fact that wf <dig> also had the second highest segregation distortion ratio for tested markers and the lowest locus density, both of which would cause unstable locus order.

hayashi et al.  reported that differences in locus order on a linkage map represent chromosomal rearrangements in lotus japonicus  <cit> . in the current study, the loci in the 110– <dig> cm region of lg <dig> in the hr-specific map were not located in the corresponding position on the consensus map. these results suggest the possibility of a chromosomal rearrangement in this region. however, the overall conservation of locus order indicates that chromosomal rearrangements have not occurred frequently in red clover.

microsatellite and rflp markers occasionally detected multiple loci. it is possible that these markers detected paralogous regions that do not always give rise to polymorphisms in each parental combination. rflp markers generated multiple loci more often than microsatellite markers, which suggests that microsatellite markers are more suitable than rflp markers as consensus markers. however, the larger percentage of bridging microsatellite markers  that detected multiple loci as compared to total microsatellite markers  emphasizes that care must be taken with respect to multiple loci when carrying out marker analysis using various unrelated accessions in red clover.

the average number of alleles per microsatellite locus and pic in  <dig> red clover individuals was  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. this is an intermediate level of polymorphism relative to the results of sato et al.  and dias et al.   <cit> . because the number of loci and red clover individuals that were tested in the current study were extremely large compared to these two previous reports, the results of the current study likely represent values that are more typical for red clover germplasms.

using the genome-wide allele frequency data of  <dig> red clover individuals and  <dig> microsatellite loci, we carried out a preliminary estimate of the extent of linkage disequilibrium  using the ggt  <dig>  program  <cit> . there was no significant correlation between d' and distance between two loci . this result suggests that the extent of ld in red clover is low. for a highly heterozygous species, ld mapping is a more effective approach to qtl detection than interval mapping, as it captures a wider spectrum of genetic diversity. however, ld mapping is more difficult in a heterozygous species than in a homozygous species, because the extent of ld is likely to be small, and, therefore, more markers are required to detect significant associations between marker genotypes and specific traits. the dense consensus linkage map developed in this study will accelerate ld mapping in red clover, as well as qtl detection by interval mapping.

CONCLUSIONS
we have constructed the first consensus linkage map for red clover. the locus order of the present consensus map is highly consistent, and is sufficiently reliable for use as a reference for the genetic analysis of random red clover germplasms. the consensus map and genome-wide polymorphic information provided by the current study will facilitate further genetic advances in the molecular breeding of red clover in the near future.
