BACKGROUND
the proteasome is a multi-subunit protease complex, consisting of a 20s core particle and a 19s regulatory particle. 20s contains predominantly structural α and catalytic β subunits. 19s contains non-atpase subunits that are involved in the recognition of polyubiquitinated proteins, and atpase subunits responsible for unfolding substrates and maintaining protease activity. the ubiquitin-proteasome system  is considered to be the main route for the degradation of short-lived proteins. proteasomal activity is also essential for eliminating excess or unfolded proteins and thus contributes to establishing steady-state overall protein levels. the selective and often well-timed degradation of regulatory proteins by the proteasome orchestrates and modulates multiple biological processes such as transcription, metabolism, cell cycle progression and differentiation  <cit> .

during the main pathway of autophagy, initially appearing membrane cisterns called phagophores capture portions of the cytoplasm in double-membrane autophagosomes. these vesicles then deliver cargo for lysosomal degradation  <cit> . autophagy is thought to be mainly responsible for degrading long-lived proteins and whole organelles, and stress-induced autophagy maintains the amino acid pool and energy production necessary for biosynthetic processes during chronic starvation  <cit> .

ups and autophagy were long considered as independent, parallel pathways. recent observations challenged this view, suggesting interactions between these degradative routes  <cit> . first, autophagy also plays an important role in the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. loss of autophagy leads to neurodegeneration accompanied by the formation of pathological protein aggregates both in mice and flies  <cit> . these aggregates contain ubiquitinated proteins and p <dig> , an autophagy receptor. p <dig> facilitates selective autophagic removal of ubiquitinated cargo by binding to both ubiquitin and atg <dig> that is covalently bound to phagophore and autophagosome membranes  <cit> . second, protein degradation by the autophagy and ups pathways is coordinately regulated by the evolutionarily conserved foxo transcription factors in muscles  <cit> . in addition, we recently showed that genes encoding proteins of the ups are upregulated in response to starvation in autophagy mutant drosophila larvae compared to starved control animals  <cit> . third, impairment of the ups has been shown to enhance autophagy in various cells, but the molecular links are poorly characterized  <cit> .

in this study, we investigated the consequences of proteasome inhibition on aggregate formation and autophagic activity in somatic clones of larval fat body cells in drosophila. we showed that genetic activation of hypoxia signaling induces autophagy, and identified hif-1α as a novel molecular link between ups and autophagy.

RESULTS
depletion of genes encoding various proteasome subunits leads to impaired proteasomal degradation in vivo
we selected transgenic rnai lines to mediate inducible silencing of  <dig> genes encoding different proteasome subunits in drosophila. expression of these uas-proteasome rnai constructs can be triggered in vivo in a tissue-specific manner by simply crossing these lines to another line that carries an appropriate promoter-gal <dig> transgene . as systemic rnai mediated by an actin-gal <dig> driver resulted in developmental delays and lethality in case of the majority of rnai lines, we used the standard mosaic approach to generate rnai cells  in an otherwise wild-type background. to investigate proteasome activity in vivo, we analyzed transgenic flies expressing a fluorescent reporter of ups function. gfp-cl <dig> is a fusion protein created by introducing a degradation signal to the otherwise stable green fluorescent protein   <cit> . this protein is rapidly degraded by the ups, and its steady state levels reflect the functional status of this pathway. in control animals, clones of fat body cells expressing gfp-cl <dig> were similar in size to neighboring cells and showed weak, diffuse gfp fluorescence . gal4-mediated expression of either one of  <dig> out of  <dig> different rnai lines decreased cell size and led to the accumulation and large-scale aggregation of gfp-cl <dig>  indicating impaired proteasomal degradation activity .

proteasome maturation protein  facilitates the main steps in 20s core complex formation at the er by coordinating the assembly process, and it is necessary for the continuous supply of newly formed proteasomes. similar to the above results, depletion of pomp also resulted in accumulation of gfp-cl <dig> .

we have also tested the level of p <dig>  a well-characterized intracellular receptor for ubiquitinated proteins. as ubiquitin-containing proteins were shown to be captured into aggregates of p <dig>  <cit> , inactivation of the proteasome was expected to increase p <dig> aggregation due to a block in ubiquitinated protein degradation. note that in the various staining experiments in genetic mosaic animals, gfp-positive rnai cells are always surrounded by control cells in the very same tissue, which serve as an internal control to directly compare phenotypes to . immunostainings indeed revealed large ubiquitin- and p62-positive aggregates in the cytoplasm of proteasome subunit rnai cells compared to control non-gfp cells . importantly, aggregates never colocalized with the lysosome marker lamp1-gfp in these cells, suggesting that aggregated proteins are not accumulated inside lysosomes. quantification of immunostainings revealed that  <dig> out of the  <dig> rnai lines  led to large-scale accumulation of endogenous p <dig> aggregates . notably, exactly the same seven lines failed to trigger a statistically significant elevation of both p <dig> and gfp-cl <dig> aggregates. this may be due to that these rnai lines did not work properly in fat body cells, although it cannot be excluded that some of the proteasome subunits targeted by these seven rnai lines are dispensable for proteasome function. the transcription of p <dig> is also regulated during starvation and stress, both in drosophila and mammalian cells  <cit> . rt-pcr experiments revealed that p <dig> transcription in proteasome depleted animals was also increased relative to controls .

it was obvious in these experiments that smaller fat body cells had higher gfp-cl <dig> levels . this suggested that proteasomal degradation is necessary for proper growth and endomitosis of larval fat body cells, and a more severe block of proteasome function likely produces smaller cells.

we selected five proteasome subunit rnai lines for further experiments that all worked very well in both in vivo proteasome activity assays . these represent different subunit types: 20s core particle subunits prosα <dig>  prosα <dig>  prosβ <dig>  and 19s regulatory particle subunits rpt <dig>  rpn <dig> .

proteasome impairment enhances starvation-induced and basal autophagy
lysotracker red  staining is an established and widely used assay for detection of autolysosomes in drosophila fat body and other tissues  <cit> . inactivation of proteasome function increased autophagic activity in lamp1-gfp-marked fat body cell clones of starved larvae, based on increased punctate ltr labeling compared to surrounding non-gfp control cells . ltr structures also colocalized with lamp1-gfp in clone cells, an artificial reporter that labels late endosomes and all lysosomes in drosophila cells  <cit> . note that the colocalization is not complete, as ltr only stains acidic, actively digesting lysosomes, whereas primary lysosomes are also labeled by lamp1-gfp. moreover, lamp1-gfp is continuously degraded in active lysosomes, so its levels are often strongly decreased in ltr structures .

these genetic manipulations also activated autophagy in a cell-autonomous manner in well-fed larvae, based on increased ltr and autophagosome-associated punctate anti-atg8a immunostainings . similarly, knockdown of genes encoding proteasome subunits led to elevated levels of autophagosome-associated, lipidated atg8a-ii in western blots of well-fed larvae . levels of the ubiquitin-binding selective autophagy cargo p <dig> also showed a marked increase in these samples .

we found that upon proteasome rnai, smaller cells always had increased normalized ltr dot number . thus, more severe proteasome inactivation seems to induce higher levels of autophagy and a stronger cell growth impairment.

proteasome rnai leads to accumulation of cytoplasmic aggregates and enhances autophagic flux
we have recently described that overexpressed p <dig> and atg8a reporters bind each other to form large aggregates in drosophila fat body cells  <cit> . overexpressed gfp-tagged atg8a, a routinely used marker of autophagosomes  <cit> , not only labeled small structures likely representing genuine autophagosomes with a diameter of about  <dig> μm, but also colocalized with the large p62-positive aggregates  that formed in proteasome rnai cells . importantly, small genuine autophagosomes marked by endogenous anti-atg8a staining  <cit>  showed markedly different size and distribution from this overexpressed atg8a reporter in proteasome rnai cells . we next employed a tandemly tagged mcherry-gfp-atg8a reporter, a standard assay to follow autophagic flux  <cit> . this reporter is selectively transported to autolysosomes, where gfp is quenched while mcherry remains fluorescent. in addition to small mcherry-positive autolysosomes in the perinuclear region of proteasome rnai cells, large structures positive for both gfp and mcherry were also formed, with a size and localization again reminiscent of protein aggregates . treatment with the lysosome inhibitor chloroquine prevented the quenching of gfp in acidic autolysosomes in proteasome rnai cells, greatly decreasing the number of structures that were positive for only mcherry .

we then carried out electron microscopy to completely rule out the possibility that these large aggregates were inside autophagosomes. ultrastructural images of proteasome depleted fat bodies dissected from well-fed animals revealed the presence of large cytoplasmic protein aggregates that were never surrounded by membranes . in addition, double-membrane autophagosomes and degrading autolysosomes were also readily detected in well-fed larval samples, consistent with autophagy induction in these cells . see also additional file 11: figure s <dig> for further ultrastructural images.

it was striking that upon proteasome rnai, smaller cells always had increased p <dig> accumulation . these results altogether indicated that even though autophagic activity is enhanced in these cells, it fails to remove the excess protein aggregates formed due to impaired proteasomal degradation.

as expected, ltr practically never colocalized with atg8a or p <dig> reporters . even the size of these structures was different: ltr-positive digesting lysosomes in fat body cells had an approximate diameter of 1- <dig> μm, while p <dig> was present in the large protein aggregates , and gfp-atg8a labeled small autophagosomes  in addition to being captured into the large p <dig> aggregates.

these data altogether suggest that p <dig> accumulation is due to both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms, that is, increased rate of transcription, and reduced protein turnover by autophagy due to large-scale aggregate formation.

activation of hypoxia signaling induces autophagy in drosophila
one of the best characterized substrates of ups is the α subunit of hypoxia-inducible transcription factor hif- <dig>  <cit> . hif-1α is ubiquitinated by the tumor suppressor protein von hippel-lindau  under normoxic conditions, resulting in its proteasomal degradation. decreased levels of oxygen lead to stabilization of hif-1α by preventing its ubiquitination, and a concomitant upregulation of genes involved in the hypoxia response  <cit> . hypoxia is a known trigger of autophagy in mammalian cells, but its role has not been characterized in drosophila autophagy. the fly ortholog of the mammalian hif-1α gene is sima   <cit> . overexpression of sima, or depletion of vhl led to the formation of ltr-positive autolysosomes in fat body cell clones of well-fed larvae . similarly, forced expression of sima or vhl rnai induced punctate mcherry-atg8a representing autophagosomes and autolysosomes . the mcherry-gfp-atg8a reporter revealed that most of the punctate autophagic structures were positive for only mcherry in sima overexpressing and vhl rnai cells . this indicated that gfp-atg8a was delivered to autolysosomes and quenched. chloroquine treatment again reduced the number of structures that were positive for only mcherry , indicating that autophagic flux is enhanced in these cells.

we also carried out anti-active caspase  <dig> stainings to analyze cell death, but no apoptotic caspase activation was detected in cell clones undergoing proteasome or vhl rnai, or overexpressing sima in larval tissues 

proteasome inactivation-induced autophagy requires atg genes and sima/hif-1α
since genetic activation of hypoxia signaling increased autophagy, we first tested whether proteasome rnai activates this pathway. bnip <dig>  is a well-characterized transcriptional target of hif <dig> in mammalian cells  <cit> . our rt-pcr experiments revealed that transcription of drosophila bnip <dig>  is enhanced upon silencing of rpn <dig> to a similar extent as in vhl rnai animals . additionally, proteasome rnai increased the expression level of an in vivo transcriptional reporter for hypoxia signaling .

these results suggested that hypoxia signaling may be involved in proteasome rnai-induced autophagy. to evaluate the genetic pathways mediating compensatory autophagy upon proteasome impairment, we tested the potential role of sima, core atg genes required for starvation-induced autophagy, and p <dig> 

clones of fat body cells showed ltr-positive autolysosome formation in well-fed animals upon silencing of prosβ <dig>  rpt <dig> and rpn <dig> . we silenced sima using  <dig> independent transgenic constructs, each of which targeted different regions of this gene and achieved knockdown by distinct experimental approaches . depletion of sima significantly inhibited proteasome inactivation-induced punctate ltr staining in most combinations . depletion of atg <dig>  atg <dig> or atg <dig> also blocked compensatory autophagy, similar to expression of dominant-negative atg <dig>  vps <dig> or atg <dig> transgenes . as a negative control we used an rnai line for atg18b, as this gene was shown to be dispensable for starvation-induced autophagy in drosophila   <cit> . finally, we tested the role of p <dig> using previously characterized transgenic rnai lines  <cit> . depletion of p <dig> by combining two indepedent rnai lines targeting different regions of the gene, or using a third transgenic rnai line failed to suppress proteasome inactivation-induced punctate ltr staining: the changes were not statistically significant . as expected, depletion of p <dig> completely prevented the formation of p <dig> aggregates in proteasome inactivated cells .

as a final confirmation of our results, we also tested two additional proteasome rnai lines for hypoxia and p <dig> signaling. depletion of sima, but not p <dig>  also reduced the number of ltr puncta in prosα <dig> and prosα <dig> rnai cells .

discussion
autophagy and ups coordinately sustain cellular homeostasis through protein quality control and clearance. a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases  are characterized by accumulation of aggregate-prone proteins that are not efficiently removed by proteasome. compensatory autophagy may alleviate disease pathology in these cases, as numerous studies showed that substrates of autophagy and ups overlap  <cit> . indeed, genetic or pharmacological activation of autophagy facilitates aggregate clearance and neuronal function in disease models  <cit> . chronic block of proteasomal degradation also leads to toxicity, er stress and cell death in various mammalian and drosophila cells, and proteasome inhibitors are in clinical use to trigger apoptosis of cancer cells in multiple myeloma patients  <cit> . while we found no evidence of cell death in larval drosophila fat body upon silencing of genes encoding essential subunits of the proteasome or genetic activation of hypoxia signaling, these genetic manipulations strongly enhanced both basal and starvation-induced autophagy in these cells, and this effect was dependent on canonical autophagy genes atg <dig>  vps <dig>  atg <dig>  atg <dig> and atg <dig> 

an important aspect of our study is that overexpressed tagged atg <dig> is not ideal for analyzing autophagy in proteasome rnai cells, as excess p62-containing aggregates incorporate these reporter molecules, likely due to the physical interaction of p <dig> and atg <dig>  this artefact may then lead to false conclusions regarding autophagic activity, similar to the case of co-overexpressed p <dig> and atg <dig> reporters  <cit> .

how does proteasome impairment lead to compensatory autophagy? multiple scenarios are possible, and these are not mutually exclusive. one hypothesis would be that accumulation of excess cargo triggers the formation of autophagosomes. however, overexpression of specific autophagy substrates p <dig> or blue cheese  did not result in an obvious increase in autophagy in drosophila, unlike proteasome impairment  <cit> . moreover, p <dig> was found to be dispensable for both viability and starvation-induced autophagy in knockout mice  <cit> . multiple selective autophagy receptors have been identified in mammalian cells, but these are relatively uncharacterized in drosophila, as only hdac <dig> and blue cheese have been analyzed so far besides p <dig>  <cit> . further studies are necessary to find out whether any of the selective adaptors is involved in autophagy induced by proteasome inactivation, or by starvation. after all, autophagy is thought to be responsible for breakdown and recycling of bulk cytoplasm upon nutrient limitation  <cit> , so it is possible that none of the receptors are actually required for these large-scale autolysosomal degradation processes.

a second hypothesis is that proteasomal degradation is essential to maintain free intracellular amino acid levels and compensatory autophagy is induced by amino acid shortage, as suggested in a recent publication  <cit> . in this paper, addition of exogenous amino acids was reported to attenuate proteasome inactivation-induced autophagy and partially rescue lifespan reduction in flies treated with a proteasome inhibitor  <cit> . in this scenario, loss of autophagy in cells with impaired proteasome activity would further reduce amino acid levels as both recycling pathways are inhibited, presumably resulting in a stronger block of cell growth. however, blocking the function of core autophagy genes did not further decrease the growth of proteasome rnai cells in fat body clones, indicating that reduced amino acid levels are likely not the only link between these processes in this setting.

a third hypothesis is that stabilization of certain proteasome substrate positively regulates autophagy. the levels of hif-1α are normally kept low through ubiquitination mediated by vhl, which is followed by proteasomal degradation. hypoxia leads to stabilization of hif-1α, resulting in its translocation to the nucleus and upregulation of hypoxia-inducible genes that mediate survival at low oxygen concentrations  <cit> . cytoprotective autophagy is also induced by hypoxia, and hypoxia-induced autophagy is necessary for survival of cancer cells in the central, poorly vascularized regions of solid tumors  <cit> . we found that genetic activation of hypoxia signaling induced autophagy in drosophila, and silencing of the fly hif-1α ortholog sima attenuated proteasome impairment-induced autophagy. these results suggest that autophagy is enhanced by proteasome inhibition at least in part through hypoxia signaling. a recent genome-wide association study identified mutations affecting the ups pathway in renal cell carcinoma, which were associated with increased levels of hif-1α in these tumors  <cit> . interestingly, cells derived from many established cancers show elevated levels of autophagy, and multiple oncogenes and tumor suppressors  encode enzymes of the ups involved in ubiquitin conjugation or deconjugation  <cit> . thus, based on these and our results, activation of hypoxia signaling by ups impairment may be responsible for increased autophagy in the absence of hypoxic conditions in a subset of established cancers.

CONCLUSIONS
our work showed that genetic inactivation of proteasomal degradation induces compensatory autophagy in the widely used drosophila fat body model, which requires core autophagy genes atg <dig>  vps <dig>  atg <dig>  atg <dig> and atg <dig>  proteasome impairment leads to large-scale accumulation of aggregates containing ubiquitinated proteins and the selective autophagy cargo p <dig>  but p <dig> itself turned out to be largely dispensable for enhanced autophagy. finally, we showed that genetic activation of hypoxia/hif-1α signaling induces autophagy in drosophila, and hif-1α/sima, a well-characterized proteasome substrate, contributes to autophagy induced by proteasome impairment.
