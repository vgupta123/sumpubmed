BACKGROUND
poly polymerase- <dig>  is a nuclear protein that catalyzes the transfer of adp-ribose units to various nuclear proteins as a post-translational modification  <cit> . poly  is a highly negatively charged molecule and poly  of chromatin-bound proteins including histone may change the interaction of the modified proteins with dna or other proteins. a 'histone shuttle model' proposed by althaus et al. can explain the dynamic changes of chromatin structure through histone replacement induced by parp- <dig> activation  <cit> . accumulating evidence suggests that under parp- <dig> deficiency, transcriptional regulation, cell differentiation, and tumorigenesis are substantially affected. for example, parp- <dig> is involved in the regulation of reg <dig> gene  <cit>  as a transcription factor. as a co-activator, parp- <dig> plays a role in the regulation of ligand-induced transactivation of ecdysone receptor  <cit> , and in the transcriptional control of the target genes by ap- <dig>  <cit> , and by myb  <cit> . as a co-repressor, parp- <dig> regulates the expression of rxr-regulated genes  <cit>  and also plays an auto-regulatory role in the transcription of the parp- <dig> gene itself  <cit> . parp- <dig> also modulates the activity of the transcription factor nf-κb and consequently, the expression of nf-κb-dependent genes, including inducible nitric oxide synthetase   <cit> . the expression of nearly 1% of the genes, including those involved in cell cycle control and dna replication was affected in exon  <dig> disrupted parp-1-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts   <cit> . parp-deficient drosophila showed attenuation of gene expression located in puff loci and also lost puff formation, suggesting a role for parp in the induction of genes located at specific chromosomal loci  <cit> .

recent studies further suggest that parp- <dig> is involved in the regulation of dynamic changes of gene expression induced by specific stimuli. parp- <dig> is associated with transcriptionally repressed chromatin domains, which do not overlap with the regions where histone h <dig> is located  <cit> . nad-dependent alteration of chromatin structure through parp- <dig> auto-modification was demonstrated to lead to activation of estrogen induced estrogen receptor dependent transcription  <cit> . in addition, the parp inhibitor, 3-aminobenzamide induced hypermethylation of the htf <dig> gene, suggesting the presence of a negative correlation between poly and dna methylation  <cit> . in spite of the above evidence, how parp- <dig> is involved in the epigenetic regulation and functions in the maintenance of basal gene expression profiles of cells are not well understood.

we previously reported induction of the trophoblast lineage in exon  <dig> disrupted parp-1-/- es cells during teratocarcinoma-like tumor formation  <cit> , as well as in vitro culture  <cit> . simultaneous induction of several trophoblast marker genes, including placental lactogen i and ii, proliferin and tpbp  in parp-1-/- es cells took place without any stimulus during trophoblast induction  <cit> . we therefore considered that es cells as well as tissues in live mice might be good material in which to study the effects of parp- <dig> deficiency on a basal level of gene expression, namely epigenetic regulation, at the genome-wide level. in this study, global gene expression profiles were studied in exon  <dig> disrupted parp-1-/- es cells as well as in the livers of mice.

RESULTS
gene expression profile in parp-1-/- es cells
a comparison of the basal gene expression profiles in parp-1-/- es cells to their wild-type  counterparts, is presented in fig. 1a–c and table  <dig>  we found the expression of  genes, namely  <dig> %, was different by at least 2-fold between parp-1-/- and parp-1+/+ es cells  . notably, a larger fraction of the genes,  <dig> %  was down-regulated, whereas only  <dig> %  of the genes were up-regulated .

we also made the heatmaps using the gene lists containing the  <dig> genes that showed a difference at p <  <dig>  in es cells . although we used independently isolated parp-1-/- es cell clones, a clear common alteration in the gene expression profile was observed .

we further selected the genes that showed relatively high expression levels  or "marginal"  in all six replicates of the genotype within the  <dig> genes that showed a difference at p <  <dig> , see table 1). among the  <dig> genes that this analysis identified, there were  <dig> genes, obviously including the parp- <dig>  gene itself, that were down-regulated and  <dig> genes up-regulated, as listed in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  reduced expression of igfbp <dig>  and galnt <dig>  in parp-1-/- es cells was further confirmed by northern blot analysis . these down- and up-regulated genes in parp-1-/- es cells are involved in a variety of cellular processes, including transcription, metabolism, signaling, immune response, cell structure, and other cellular processes .

gene expression profile of the livers and ef cells
in the livers,  <dig> %  of genes showed a significant difference in expression level  between the parp- <dig> genotypes. in the livers of parp-1-/- mice,  <dig> %  of the genes were down-regulated and  <dig> %  of the genes were up-regulated . similar to parp-1-/- es cells, a higher percentage of the genes, 62% , were down-regulated and the remaining 38% were up-regulated . the expression of representative marker genes of the liver, including albumin  and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase  was similarly high in both parp- <dig> genotypes.

the heatmaps were constructed using the gene lists containing the  <dig> genes that showed a difference at p <  <dig>  in livers . parp- <dig> deficiency commonly altered gene expression profiles in the livers of two mice analyzed . among  <dig> genes, we identified  <dig> genes that showed a relatively high level of expression  and were altered 2-fold or greater between the parp-1-/- and parp-1+/+ livers  . among them,  <dig> genes were down-regulated and  <dig> genes were up-regulated.

in the case of the ef cells, the results obtained from these  <dig> replicates are shown in table  <dig>  in parp-1-/- ef cells,  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  genes were down- and up-regulated, respectively . we were not able to construct gene lists with a p value less than p <  <dig> .

comparison of the profiles among different cell types
we compared gene expression profiles between parp-1-/- es cells and the livers. there were no commonly up- or down-regulated genes in tables  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  namely in the genes showing relatively high expression levels selected by flag values, although we observed that  <dig> genes including eif2s <dig> , parp- <dig>  and  <dig> genes were commonly down- and up-regulated in the es cells and livers , respectively . there was no gene commonly altered in es cells, livers, and efs. comparison of the affected genes in the es cells, livers, and ef cells thus revealed that parp-1-deficiency mostly altered the expression level of different sets of genes depending on the cell types.

up-regulation of the differentiation pathway to extraembryonic tissues in parp-1-/- es cells
among the genes, we found up-regulation of h <dig>  sparc, sox <dig>  and gata <dig> in parp-1-/- es cells . the h <dig> gene has been suggested to regulate differentiation into extraembryonic tissues including trophoblast lineage and extraembryonic endoderms  <cit> . sparc, sox <dig>  and gata <dig> are known as marker genes of extraembryonic endoderms  <cit> . because we previously reported induction of trophoblast lineage in untreated parp-1-/- es cells during in vitro culture, we speculated that a higher level of h <dig> expression in parp-1-/- es cells may be involved in induction of extraembryonic tissues including trophoblast lineage. the mouse h <dig> gene is located on the distal region of chromosome  <dig> and encodes the  <dig>  kb untranslated transcript, which is maternally expressed, and the h <dig> gene and the insulin-like growth factor  <dig>  gene are reciprocally imprinted  <cit> .

we analyzed expression of h <dig> and igf <dig> genes in untreated parp-1-/- and parp-1+/+ es cell lines by semi-quantitative rt-pcr . we confirmed that the h <dig> gene is up-regulated, whereas the igf <dig> gene, which is reciprocally imprinted was slightly down-regulated in both the two parp-1-/-es cell lines.

h <dig> is highly expressed in extraembryonic tissues, including placenta and cells quite similar to the parietal endoderm of extraembryonic lineages, during es cell differentiation  <cit> . because withdrawal of lif during es cell culture causes differentiation of es cells  <cit> , we further analyzed expression of the h <dig> gene and other trophoblast marker genes for  <dig> days after withdrawal of lif by semi-quantitative rt-pcr. we observed earlier and greater up-regulation of the h <dig> gene in two parp-1-/- es cells compared to wild-type cells . we also observed a higher level of induction of trophoblast stem cell marker gene caudal-related homeobox  <dig>   <cit> . the induction of trophoblast giant cell marker gene, proliferin   <cit>  was only observed in parp-1-/- es cell lines . in contrast, pou domain, class  <dig>  transcription factor  <dig>  gene, which is a marker gene of undifferentiated es cells  <cit> , was gradually down-regulated in both genotypes during differentiation, although the expression level of oct 3/ <dig> gene became slightly lower in parp-1-/- than in parp-1+/+ es cell lines at day  <dig> after withdrawal of lif .

these results suggest that the potential for differentiation into trophoblasts is increased in es cells under parp- <dig> deficiency.

possible roles of parp- <dig> in global gene expression profiles
using genome-wide analysis of gene expression in different cell types, we showed that the expression of a number of genes is affected by the loss of parp- <dig> in both es cells as well as in the liver. the results suggest that parp- <dig> may be involved directly or indirectly in maintenance of their regulation of expression. the genes that showed altered expressions in parp-1-/- es cells, livers and ef cells are mostly different depending on the cell type, and are not apparently clustered at particular loci on specific chromosomes, and both house-keeping and inducible genes were present in the affected gene lists. functional categorization of the altered genes in parp-1-/- es cells and livers showed that these genes are involved in various cellular processes . the parp-1-/- and parp-1+/+ es cells, which we used showed no difference in growth rate  <cit>  and cell-cycle distribution  <cit> , and the karyotype is the same   <cit> . in mice, we did not observe any differences in body weight nor in the histology of the livers between parp- <dig> genotypes. therefore, the differences in gene expression should not be caused indirectly by differences in growth and cell proliferation but might be intrinsic to the absence of parp- <dig> molecules. in the case of the ef cells, about 1% of the analyzed genes showed altered levels of expression. we did not observe any genes overlapping between the report on parp-1-/- ef cells disrupted at exon  <dig>  <cit> , and our present results with the exon  <dig> disrupted efs. this may be possibly due to differences in targeting construct, genetic backgrounds or the heterogeneity of efs.

accumulating evidence suggests that parp- <dig> regulates gene expression by modulating transcriptional factors, including yy <dig>  <cit> , oct- <dig>  <cit> , nf-κb  <cit> , e <dig>  <cit> , and tef- <dig>  <cit> . in these cases, parp- <dig> stimulates loading of these transcriptional factors to cognate target sequences through protein-protein interaction. however, it is noteworthy that the target genes of these transcription factors did not show altered expression in this study. parp- <dig> is also able to act as co-activator for retinoic acid receptor -mediated transcription of rarβ <dig> gene  <cit>  and β-catenin/tcf <dig> complex-dependent transcription  <cit> . in the case of rxrα  <cit> , parp- <dig> may act as a co-repressor for ligand-induced gene activation. again, in this study, the target genes for rarβ <dig> or rxrα genes were not deregulated in parp-1-/- es cells and in the livers. it is thus suggested that loss of parp- <dig> may affect the maintenance of basal expression level of a wide variety of the genes in es cells and the livers through different mechanisms from the regulation involving these transcription factors.

in addition, parp- <dig> binds to the scaffold/matrix attachment region  containing partially unwound at-rich sequences that form local non-b structures  <cit> . parp- <dig> binds to other non-b dna structures including hairpin, cruciform, and loop, and is catalytically activated  <cit> . the variations of gene promoter/enhancer structure and parp- <dig> binding and recruitment in different cell types may be possibly related to the observed differences in the effect of parp- <dig> deficiency on expression profiles.

since parp inhibitors are shown to cause hypermethylation of particular genes  <cit> , loss of parp- <dig> may possibly cause local changes in dna methylation pattern during dna replication and may further affect histone acetylation or methylation, thereby causing genome wide alteration of gene expression after rounds of cell division. in this context, it is notable that similar to the case of parp-1-/- cells, the majority  of differentially expressed genes  was down-regulated in the cells deficient in trrap, a co-factor of histone acetyltransferase  <cit> .

parp- <dig> is able to modify histones and contributes to the opening of condensed highly ordered chromatin structures  <cit> . furthermore, parp- <dig> is a structural component of the transcriptionally repressed state of chromatin, and transcription is reported to be activated by auto-modification activity in an nad-dependent manner  <cit> . therefore, the roles of parp- <dig> as a chromatin-modifying factor may contribute to maintenance of global gene expression during cell proliferation through mechanisms involving polyadp-ribosylation, protein-protein interaction, and poly-protein interactions.

biological impact of parp- <dig> deficiency on gene expression relating to differentiation
we observed genes involved in the pathway of extraembryonic tissue development, namely h <dig>  sparc, sox <dig>  and gata <dig>  are up-regulated in untreated parp-1-/- es cells . in addition, during differentiation of es cells after withdrawal of lif, expression of h <dig> as well as other trophoblast marker genes were further up-regulated in parp-1-/- es cells compared to parp-1+/+ es cells . we previously reported that the increase of trophoblast marker genes, plf, prlpa, and tcfap <dig> was detected in untreated parp-1-/- es clone  using genespring  <dig>   <cit> . in the present paper, these genes were not picked up by genespring  <dig>  using two parp-1-/- es clones, probably because the criteria which we applied in this study were highly restricted and the expression level of the genes needed to be relatively high in at least one genotype. this is consistent with the fact that the gene expression changes associated with trophoblast induction were observed only in a subpopulation of es cells by in situ hybridization  <cit> . in fact, plf gene expression is not detectable in undifferentiated parp-1+/+ and parp-1-/- es cells by rt-pcr . in contrast, the differentially expressed genes picked up in the present study are expected to be the representative genes affected in a large cell population. h <dig> is likely to be one of such genes in parp-1-/- es cells.

the biological function of h <dig> rna has not been fully understood yet. several lines of evidence show that the h <dig> gene is involved in extraembryonic tissue development as briefly mentioned earlier. the homozygous mutant animals with a targeted deletion of the maternal h <dig> gene are viable and fertile and display an overgrowth phenotype of fetus and placentae compared with wild-type  <cit> . mouse parthenogenetic embryos showing the monoallelic expression of the h <dig> gene exhibit functional defects in placentae  <cit> , suggesting that the h <dig> gene may play an important role in the extraembryonic tissue development, especially in placentae.

increased potential of parp-1-/- es cells to differentiation into trophoblasts seemed to reflect preferential differentiation of parp-1-/- es cells to trophoblasts triggered by lif withdrawal, as shown in fig. 4b. early increase of h <dig> expression suggests that the h <dig> gene might act as an upstream regulator for the trophoblast differentiation pathway.

CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that parp- <dig> is required to maintain transcriptional regulation of a wide variety of genes on a genome-wide scale. in parp-1-/- es cells and livers, we observed that the majority of the altered genes were down-regulated. these down- and up-regulated genes are involved in a variety of cellular processes, including transcription, metabolism, signaling, immune response, cell structure, and other cellular processes. in this study, we showed that the pathway of extraembryonic tissues including trophoblast lineage is potentially up-regulated at an untreated state and after differentiation stimuli in parp-1-/- es cells. the gene expression profiles in parp-1-deficient cells may be useful to delineate the functional role of parp- <dig> in epigenetic regulation of the genomes involved in various biological phenomena.
