BACKGROUND
histone h <dig> is involved in the formation and maintenance of chromatin higher order structures. it is currently accepted that h <dig> could have a regulatory role in transcription through the modulation of chromatin folding. h <dig> has been described as a general transcriptional repressor because it contributes to chromatin condensation, which limits the access of the transcriptional machinery to dna. other studies indicate that h <dig> might regulate transcription at more specific level, participating in complexes that either activate or repress specific genes  <cit> . preferential binding to sars   <cit>  and participation in nucleosome positioning  <cit>  are other mechanisms by which h <dig> could contribute to transcriptional regulation. h <dig> has also been implicated in the inhibition of chromatin replication  <cit> .

h <dig> histones from metazoa have a characteristic three-domain structure: a short amino-terminal domain , a central globular domain  and a long c-terminal domain   <cit> . the n- and c-terminal domains are extremely basic. the c-terminal domain is the primary determinant of h <dig> binding to chromatin  <cit> . several properties of linker histones, such as the ability to stabilize chromatin folding  <cit> , the preferential binding to sars  <cit> , activation of apoptotic nuclease  <cit>  and binding to heterochromatin protein hp1α  <cit> , appear to be determined by the c-terminal domain.

h <dig> has multiple isoforms. the sequences of over  <dig> subtypes from plants, invertebrates and vertebrates are available. often more than one subtype is expressed in a given species. in mammals, at least six somatic subtypes, h1a-e and h1°, a male germ-line specific subtype, h1t, and an oocyte-specific subtype, h1oo, are expressed  <cit> . the subtypes differ in their timing of expression  <cit> , extent of phosphorylation  <cit>  and turnover rate  <cit> . in vitro evidence supports the hypothesis that the subtypes differ in their ability to condense chromatin  <cit> . in vertebrates, the amino acid substitution rates differ among subtypes by almost one order of magnitude, suggesting that each subtype could have acquired a unique function  <cit> . developmental and gene expression studies also support that the different subtypes play distinct roles in chromatin structure  <cit> .

linker histone molecules can exchange in vitro and in vivo between chromatin binding sites  <cit> . we have used this fact to devise a competitive assay to estimate the relative affinities of the subtypes h1a-e and h1° for long chromatin fragments in physiological salt. the results described here also show that although the absolute affinities of h <dig> subtypes for different dna sequences can vary widely, the relative affinities are conserved.

RESULTS
relative affinities of the h <dig> subtypes for dna
the relative affinities of the h <dig> subtypes for a sar fragment of  <dig> bp from the drosophila histone cluster  <cit>  were estimated by competition of two or three subtypes for a limited amount of dna . the complexes were prepared by salt-gradient dialysis and their subtype composition did not change with further incubation. their composition was therefore considered to be at equilibrium or very close to equilibrium. complexes were separated from the remaining free protein by centrifugation, and the relative affinities of the competing subtypes estimated from the band intensities of the pellets and the supernatants  as described in the methods section with the expression:

 kdnai/j = / 

with increasing excess of a 1: <dig> mixture of two competing subtypes, the ratio of free subtypes, /, tends to one and the ratio of the bands in the pellets approaches the true value of kdnai/j. figures 1a and 1c show competition between h1° and h1a with excess protein of  <dig>  and  <dig>  which yield values of h1a/h1° in the pellets of about  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.

with the six subtypes h1a-e and h1° fifteen different pairs can be formed; however, five pairs, including the six subtypes, are enough to estimate the relative affinities of the six subtypes. we measured the relative affinities of eight  or nine  different pairs , and the redundancy of the data was used to calculate the best values fitting the experimental data as well as the error associated with the estimate . representative competitions are shown in figure  <dig>  the order of affinities for sar dna, expressed relative to h1a, the weakest binding subtype, was h1a <h1c <h1b <h1e<h1°<h1d, where the figures in parenthesis are the relative affinities.

similar experiments were performed with a puc <dig> fragment of  <dig> bp. the relative affinities were similar to those obtained with the sar fragment, namely h1a <h1c <h1b <h1e<h1°<h1d. the calculated relative affinities and the absolute error estimates for all possible pairs are given in tables  <dig> and  <dig> 

relative affinities of the h <dig> subtypes for chromatin
to estimate the relative affinities of the subtypes for chromatin, we perturbed the h <dig> complement of native chromatin by adding an additional amount of one of the subtypes. a small amount of sar dna was present in the mixture to avoid precipitation of chromatin by excess h <dig>  sar dna also provided a set of reference relative affinities, needed to estimate the relative affinities of the subtypes for chromatin from the distribution of the subtypes between the sar and the chromatin. the amounts of chromatin, sar and additional h <dig> were adjusted so as to keep the stoichiometry of perturbed chromatin similar to that of native chromatin. h <dig> molecules freely exchanged between the chromatin and sar binding sites, leading to a new chromatin h <dig> complement enriched in the added subtype. in the presence of  <dig> mm nacl, complete equilibration of h <dig> between chromatin and sar binding sites was reached in less than  <dig> min.

we used a sar sequence in the exchange experiments because the high binding affinity of h <dig> to sars allowed the easy separation of the h1/sar complexes from chromatin after exchange. we estimated that the binding of h <dig> to the sar fragment was about  <dig> times stronger than to the puc <dig> fragment . with polyglutamic acid, a molecular species that has been used as a histone sink in nucleosome and chromatin reconstitution, the insoluble complexes with h <dig> were contaminated with core histones. the puc <dig> fragment used in the binding experiments was also tested but the exchange was very inefficient, probably due to the much higher affinity of h <dig> for chromatin than for the puc <dig> 

in the absence of added h <dig>  the sar fragment efficiently displaced the h <dig> from chromatin . the affinity of h <dig> for chromatin binding sites, estimated from the displacement curve as described in the methods section, was about  <dig>  times that for sar binding sites . in this simple displacement experiment it could already be seen that the relative intensities of the h <dig> bands left on chromatin were similar to those of the original h <dig> complement, indicating that the relative affinities of the subtypes for chromatin and the sar were also similar. however, h1a, h1b, h1d and h1° were present at low or very low amounts in chromatin and could not be detected in this kind of displacement experiment. furthermore, we wished to measure the relative affinities of the subtypes at a stoichiometry similar to that of native chromatin. with this goal in mind, the h <dig> complement was redefined by adding a certain amount of a purified subtype. independent experiments were performed with each of the six subtypes . the experimental relative affinities, kchri/j, were calculated from the band intensities of the sar complexes and chromatin  as described in the methods section with the expression:

 kcromi/j = ksari/j 

as for the experiments of interaction with dna, the redundancy of the experimental data allowed the estimate of the best values of relative affinity and the percentage error associated to the estimate.

the experimental relative affinities are shown in table  <dig>  the values of e/c outnumber all other i/j values because as major subtypes they could be measured in all perturbation experiments. in contrast, h1a, b, d were virtually absent from native chromatin. it is to be noted that the values of e/c were remarkably similar with independence of the added subtype, further indicating that the subtype composition had reached equilibrium. using these values, the relative affinities best fitting the experimental values were calculated for all possible pairs, together with the absolute error estimates . table  <dig> shows the overall error estimates resulting from propagation of the errors in the estimates of the relative affinity for the sar. the average of these estimates expressed in percentage is about 18%.

the relative affinities of the h <dig> subtypes for chromatin expressed in function of the weakest binding subtype h1a were: h1a <h1b <h1c <h1e <h1°<h1d.

the six subtypes can be classified in three groups based on affinity: the high-affinity subtypes h1e, h1d and h1°, the intermediate-affinity subtypes, h1b and h1c, and h1a, the weakest binding subtype. the differences within the groups of intermediate and high affinity are small, and become non-significant when the experimental error is considered, but the entity of the affinity groups is not compromised because the error is small compared to the differences between groups.

relative affinity of avian h <dig> for dna and chromatin
the relative affinities of chicken h <dig> and mammalian h1° for the sar and the puc <dig> dna fragments were obtained from competition experiments as those described for the mammalian subtypes . h <dig> had an affinity ~8-fold higher than h1° and ~12-fold higher than h1e for both dna fragments .

the native h <dig> complement of rat liver chromatin was perturbed with h <dig> to obtain the relative affinity of this heterologous subtype for chromatin. it can be seen that h <dig> was incorporated into chromatin . calculation of h1e/h <dig> relative affinity with equation  <dig> gave a value of ~ <dig> , which coincides with the relative affinity for sar dna. in the same experiments, an h1c/h <dig> relative affinity of ~ <dig> was obtained. the h1e/h1c relative affinity was  <dig> , which is consistent with the previous values shown in table  <dig> 

discussion
we used the free exchange of h <dig> molecules between chromatin and dna binding sites to estimate the relative affinities of h <dig> somatic subtypes h1a-e and h1° for purified chromatin fragments of 30– <dig> nucleosomes in physiological salt at constant h <dig> stoichiometry. the assay consists of perturbing the h <dig> subtype complement of native chromatin by adding a certain amount of each of the purified subtypes. the presence of an appropriate amount of sar dna, for which histone h <dig> has a very high affinity, ensures the maintenance of the original h <dig> stoichiometry while avoiding chromatin precipitation by excess h <dig>  h <dig> freely exchanges between chromatin and sar binding sites. the relative affinities of the subtypes for chromatin can be estimated from the equilibrium distribution of the subtypes between chromatin and sar, provided the relative affinities of the subtypes for the sar are known. the latter were obtained from competition experiments between two or three different subtypes for a limited amount of dna. this method could reproduce some aspects of in vivo binding, as, in a situation of free exchange, the occupation of a binding site by a given subtype should be determined by its relative concentration and affinity.

h1a is the subtype with the lowest affinity, h1b and h1c have intermediate affinities and h1°, h1e and h1d have the highest affinities. the lowest and the highest affinities differed by a factor of  <dig>  which corresponds to a Δg°, of - <dig>  kcal/mol. such a difference in binding affinity is large enough to support the functional differentiation of the subtypes. the affinities for dna are similar but not identical to those for chromatin.

to validate the method for the estimation of subtype relative affinities, we performed competition experiments with avian h <dig>  this subtype is restricted to avian nucleated erythrocytes, which are virtually transcriptionally inert. h <dig> is highly related to h1°, but in contrast to the latter, its c-terminal domain is highly arginine-rich  <cit> . this feature could contribute to the stability of the chromatin higher-order structure of avian erythrocyte chromatin. h <dig> appeared to have a binding affinity much higher than any mammalian somatic subtype for both dna and chromatin: about 12-fold higher than h1e.

the differences in affinity of the h <dig> subtypes are basically determined by the c-terminal domain of the molecule  <cit> . the c-terminal domain has little structure in dilute solution, but becomes structured upon interaction with the dna  <cit> . this suggests that small differences in the structure of the c-terminus affecting the spatial distribution of basic residues could be important in determining the differential affinity of the subtypes.

the relative affinities might be modulated in vivo by phosphorylation and other post-translational modifications such as polyadp-ribosylation, in a cell cycle and cell type specific manner, leading to a large variety of subtype affinities  <cit> .

h <dig> binding is not sequence specific; however, it shows binding preferences for certain dna sequences. besides a general preference for a.t-rich regions, h <dig> preferentially binds and aggregates scaffold-associated regions   <cit> . preference for particular non-a.t-rich sequences has also been reported  <cit> . the contribution of the features of the dna sequence, in addition to the properties of the subtypes, to the binding affinity could give rise to an even larger variety of binding strengths.

all mammalian somatic subtypes, h1a-e and h1°, preferentially bind to sars  <cit> . interestingly, the relative affinities of the subtypes for sar and non-sar dna  appear to be similar, independently of the overwhelming preference for sar dna. the conservation of the relative affinities implies that the binding preferences of the subtypes will not by themselves determine the heterogeneous distribution of some subtypes in cell nuclei, as high and lower affinity chromatin binding sites should be occupied with similar probabilities by the different subtypes. this is consistent with the basically electrostatic character of the interaction of h <dig> with the dna; however, the preference of particular subtypes for specific sequences cannot be excluded.

immunolocalization analysis has shown that h1b,d,e and h1° are heterogeneously distributed in cell nuclei. in contrast, the distribution of h1c is relatively uniform  <cit> . several observations suggest that the degree of chromatin condensation could differentially affect the affinity of particular subtypes and thus contribute to their heterogeneous distribution. avian h <dig> seems to bind to chromatin higher order structures with preference over the h <dig> subtypes of chicken erythrocytes  <cit> . subtypes with preference for heterochromatin have been identified in the dipterans chironomus and glyptotendipes  <cit> . a general effect is provided by core histone acetylation, as it has been shown that the residence time of h <dig> molecules is shortened in chromatin containing highly acetylated core histones  <cit> , and acetylation is apparently sufficient to decondense chromatin even in the presence of linker histones  <cit> . the subtypes are also non-randomly distributed with respect to active and inactive chromatin. actively transcribed sequences are presumably located in less condensed regions of chromatin. gene expression studies localize h1b in regions of active transcription and h1d and h1e in less active or inactive regions  <cit> , suggesting the association of the subtypes of high binding affinity with more condensed chromatin and of those of intermediate or low binding affinity with less condensed chromatin.

the affinity of h <dig> subtypes has been examined by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching in neuroblastoma cells stably expressing n-terminal fusions of gpf to histone h <dig> subtypes  <cit> . in spite of the complexities of in vivo conditions, in particular, the possible presence of post-translational modifications, these results agree rather well with our in vitro estimations for the subtypes h1a,c,d,e and h1°. only h1b had a higher affinity in vivo than in vitro. nuclear localization could have an affect on h <dig> exchange. it should be noted that in transformed fibroblasts gpf-h1b was localized to heterochromatic regions.

a general conclusion that can be drawn from our results with purified components is that h <dig> can freely diffuse between chromatin binding sites without the contribution of additional protein factors.

CONCLUSIONS
we have devised a competitive assay to estimate the relative affinities of the histone h <dig> somatic subtypes h1a-e and h1° for purified chromatin fragments  in physiological salt  at constant h <dig> stoichiometry. h1a was the subtype with the lowest affinity, h1b and h1c had intermediate affinities and h1d, h1e and h1° the highest affinities. the lowest and the highest affinities differed by a factor of about  <dig>  such a difference is large enough to suggest that differential affinity could be functionally relevant. the relative affinities of the subtypes for chromatin were equivalent to those estimated for a sar dna fragment and a puc <dig> fragment of similar length. avian h <dig> had a binding affinity ~12-fold higher for dna and chromatin than h1e. the conservation of the relative affinities of the subtypes for sar and non-sar dna, in spite of a strong preference for sar sequences, indicates that differential affinity alone cannot be responsible for the heterogeneous distribution of h <dig> subtypes in cell nuclei.
