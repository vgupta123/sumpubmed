BACKGROUND
high concentrations  of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate can accumulate in the brain and are thought to be involved in the etiology of a number of neurodegenerative disorders including alzheimer's disease  <cit> . a number of invitro studies indicate that at high concentrations, glutamate is a potent neurotoxin capable of destroying neurons by apoptosis  <cit> . we and others have previously reported that glutamate induces characteristic oligonucleosomal dna fragmentation  and apoptotic cell death by up and down-regulation of bax and bcl- <dig>  in a stable mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line ht <dig> which lacks caspase- <dig>  the primary activator of apoptotic dna fragmentation  <cit> . in contrast, in primary cortical cells, glutamate-induced cell death involves upregulation of caspase- <dig> and its activation via a caspase-dependent pathway involving mitochondrial signaling  <cit> . glutamate-induced dna fragmentation observed in ht <dig> cells implies that regulatory factors other than caspase- <dig> are involved in the apoptotic process in these cells.

recent studies demonstrate that calpain, a calcium-dependent protease, and apoptosis inducing factor  can play an important role in apoptotic cell death via a caspase-independent apoptotic pathway  <cit> . glutamate toxicity appears to involve a rapid ca2+ influx into neurons and these high levels of intracellular ca2+ are cytotoxic  <cit> . ca2+ can activate several key enzymes, including nitric oxide synthase  and proteases such as calpains and can also result in mitochondrial dysfunction  <cit> . furthermore, a reduction in mitochondrial transmembrane potential has been reported to accompany aif release and early apoptosis  <cit> . aif is a ubiquitously expressed flavoprotein with significant homology to bacterial oxidoreductases and has nadh oxidase activity  <cit> . following induction of apoptosis, aif translocates from the outer mitochondrial membrane to the cytosol and the nucleus, resulting in the induction of nuclear chromatin condensation and large molecular weight dna fragmentation in a caspase-independent manner  <cit> . proteases such as caspases, calpains and granzyme b  <cit> , have been reported to play a critical role in mediating apoptosis, especially the key modulator caspase- <dig>  similarly, calpains have been implicated in apoptosis in response to hypoxia and irradiation exposure in neuronal and non-neuronal cells  <cit> . calpain is a calcium-dependent papain-like neutral cysteine protease, which is widely distributed in neurons  <cit> . a number of subcellular targets have been identified as substrates for calpain cleavage, including spectrin, microtubules-associated protein , tau and neurofilaments, however, the precise physiological role of calpain remains obscure  <cit> . activation of calpain is triggered by an elevation of cytoplasmic free ca2+ concentration which results in the cleavage of various proteins and culminates in cell death  <cit> . activation of calpain is an early event in the onset of apoptosis in thymocytes therefore inhibitors of calpain can reduce this process of cell death  <cit> . calpain is also implicated in neuronal cell death associated with cerebral ischemia and other neuronal insults  <cit> .

a number of studies have demonstrated that estrogens are potent antioxidants that can inhibit some of the neurotoxic effects of oxidative stress  <cit> . we and others have reported that estrogens can increase cell survival and attenuate invitrocell death induced by potential alzheimer's disease-related insults, such as exposure to oxidized ldl and glutamate in a hippocampal cell line and primary cortical neurons  <cit> . the mechanism underlying neuroprotection by estrogens against glutamate oxidized neurotoxicity is not fully understood. recently we have reported that neuroprotection of estrogens against glutamate cytotoxicity is associated with modulation of the expression of bcl- <dig> family of genes and caspase- <dig> proteins, inhibition of cytochrome c release from mitochondria into the cytosol and prevention of dna fragmentation  <cit> . in the present study, we selected two cell types, primary cortical cells and hippocampal cell line ht <dig>  to investigate the roles of calpain, apoptosis inducing factor  and caspase- <dig> in glutamate-induced apoptosis and its prevention by estrogens. the estrogens chosen for this study were 17β-estradiol  and Δ <dig>  17β-estradiol , the latter being the more potent antioxidant  <cit> .

RESULTS
expression of erα and erβ mrna in rat cortical cells
it has been reported that the ht <dig> cell line lacks estrogen receptors  <cit> . in order to ascertain expression and relative distribution of estrogen receptors erα or erβ in rat cortical cells, we performed rt-pcr and western blot analysis . the results revealed that freshly isolated neuronal cortical cells or cells after 7– <dig> days in culture expressed both erα and erβ with the expression of erβ being higher than that of erα. both subtypes of er mrnas and the corresponding proteins were found in the adult rat uterus , with erα levels higher than those of erβ. this is in keeping with a previous report  <cit> .

anti-apoptotic effects of protease inhibitors of calpain and caspase- <dig> in mouse hippocampal cell line  and primary cortical cells
we have previously reported that glutamate treatment induces apoptotic cell death in ht <dig> cells and primary cortical cells in a time and dose-dependent manner  <cit> . we had shown that the commitment point to this death was ~ <dig> hours after initiation of  <dig> mm glutamate exposure in primary cortical cells and for ~ <dig> hour exposure with 7– <dig> mm glutamate in ht <dig> cells. based on these preliminary data, all subsequent experiments were carried out with a  <dig> hour treatment with  <dig> mm glutamate in primary cortical cells and  <dig> hours with 7– <dig> mm glutamate in ht <dig> cells.

effects of calpain and caspase inhibitors on glutamate-induced cell death
 in mouse hippocampal cell line
treatment of ht <dig> cells with  <dig> mm glutamate was initiated in the presence or absence of various concentrations of calpain i inhibitor  or pd <dig> for up to  <dig> hours. the results are depicted in figures 2a and 2b. glutamate  alone caused a significant increase  in cell death compared to control, while calpain inhibitors, either alln or pd <dig>  reduced glutamate-induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner. alln  reduced cell death by 50–70% . similarly,  <dig> to  <dig> μm of pd <dig> decreased cell death by 70–100% . however, when cells were treated at a lower glutamate concentration  for a longer period  however, cell death increased by  <dig> to 50%, and this cell death was prevented by  <dig> – <dig> μm alln . in the absence of glutamate, neither inhibitor had an effect on cell viability. the effect of calpain inhibitors on glutamate-induced apoptotic cell death was also associated with characteristic morphological changes . after an  <dig> hour incubation with  <dig> mm glutamate, degenerated and dead cells were clearly visible in the culture ; the cellular extensions  seen in untreated ht <dig> cells  were retracted and the cells appeared rounded and had detached. in the presence of calpain inhibitors,  <dig> μm alln or  <dig> μm pd <dig>  most cells survived and had the appearance of normal untreated cells . only a small number of dead cells were visible in the presence of  <dig> μm alln . in contrast, caspase inhibitors, either the specific caspase- <dig> inhibitor z-devd  or a pancaspase inhibitor z-vad  at a concentration of  <dig> μm, failed to inhibit cell death induced by  <dig> mm glutamate. this cell death was further confirmed by using ldh release assay .

 in primary cultures of rat cortical neuronal cells
to determine the role of calpain and caspase- <dig> in primary cortical cells, cells were treated with  <dig> mm glutamate in the presence or absence of calpain inhibitor  or specific caspase- <dig> inhibitor  for  <dig> hours . glutamate treatment alone induced one fold increase  in ldh release or cell death compared to control. caspase- <dig> inhibitor z-devd significantly inhibited glutamate-induced cell death by 60%. similarly, the presence of calpain inhibitor alln resulted in a 70% reduction in  glutamate -induced cell death. these data indicate that both caspase and calpain-mediated apoptosis were involved in glutamate-induced cell death in primary cortical cells. however, the addition of a combination of two protease inhibitors did not result in a greater decrease in ldh release or cell death, suggesting that calpain and caspase inhibitors has no synergetic effects on glutamate-induced cell death. protection by both inhibitors was also detectable by characteristic morphological changes . thus after a  <dig> hour incubation with  <dig> mm glutamate, degenerated and dead cells were clearly visible in the culture , the cellular extensions  seen in untreated cortical cells  were retracted, and cells appeared rounded. in the presence of calpain inhibitors  or caspase- <dig> specific inhibitor , dendrites were retained and cells had the appearance of untreated normal cells , however, some degenerated and dead cells were also visible. activation of caspase- <dig> was also detected with a highly specific active caspase- <dig> antibody raised against amino acids  <dig> to  <dig>  of murine caspase- <dig> . no change in caspase- <dig> activity was found in ht <dig> exposed to various concentrations of glutamate for up to  <dig> hours, while activation of caspase- <dig> significantly increased in glutamate-treated cells in primary cortical cells as observed previously by us  <cit> .

effects of calpain and caspase inhibitors on glutamate-induced dna fragmentation
to further investigate the effects of calpain and caspase- <dig> inhibitors on glutamate-induced programmed cell death , their effects on glutamate-induced characteristic dna fragmentation were determined. ht <dig> cells were harvested after  <dig> hours or  <dig> hours of glutamate  exposure in the presence or absence of calpain inhibitors or caspase inhibitors. total dna was extracted, purified and subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis. the results indicate that untreated cells did not display any dna fragmentation . in contrast,  glutamate treatment resulted in characteristic dna fragmentation or laddering  that was associated with an increase in cell death. addition of optimal doses of calpain inhibitors,  <dig> μm pd <dig> or  <dig> μm alln, reduced or blocked glutamate-induced dna fragmentation, . in contrast, in the presence of caspase inhibitors,  glutamate-induced dna fragmentation  was not prevented by either the caspase- <dig> specific inhibitor,  <dig> μm z-devd  or  <dig> μm z-vad  for up to  <dig> hours. in the absence of glutamate, none of the inhibitors alone  had any effect on dna fragmentation.

determination of caspase and calpain activation
activation of calpain and caspase- <dig> after glutamate exposure in the primary cortical cells and ht <dig> cells was assessed by western blot analysis by examining proteolysis of α-fodrin  utilizing an epitope-specific antibody directed against calpain or caspase- <dig> cleavage site of α-fodrin. cleavage of α-fodrin leading to formation of 150/ <dig> kda breakdown fragments is a well-recognized marker for the calpain-generated protein breakdown product  and formation of  <dig> kda fragment for the caspase- <dig> specific . antibodies raised against this epitope of α-fodrin have been shown previously to be specific for calpain-cleaved α-fodrin breakdown products  <dig> kda or/and  <dig> kda  and caspase-produced α-fodrin breakdown products  <dig> kda   <cit> . the presence of α-fodrin bdps 145/ <dig> and bdp  <dig> would suggest that calpain and caspase- <dig> are activated under apoptotic conditions  <cit> .

in ht <dig> cells, untreated cells contained the  <dig> kda intact α-fodrin band and following treatment with glutamate, the  <dig> kda band was cleaved into  <dig> kda bdp, but not the α-fodrin  <dig> kda bdp in this cell line. as shown in figure 7a, glutamate induced calpain activity in a time-dependent manner. thus, calpain activity began to increase at  <dig> hours after 7– <dig> mm glutamate exposure, which preceded glutamate-induced ldh release and apoptotic cell death, and was robustly activated by 7– <dig> hours. after a 14– <dig> hour treatment, degradation of native α-fodrin was observed and bdps were less noticeable. the addition of calpain inhibitors  completely blocked or reduced glutamate-induced formation of  <dig> kda bdps , which is consistent with the observation that they protect against glutamate-induced dna fragmentation. these data further demonstrate that calpain protease is indeed activated and mediates glutamate-induced apoptotic cell death via a caspase-independent pathway in ht <dig> cells.

in contrast to ht <dig> cells, cleavage of α-fodrin  protein into  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda bdps was found in untreated cells  . similarly, glutamate treatment resulted in an increase in the activity of calpain and caspase- <dig> in a time-dependent manner. formation of  <dig> kda bdps by calpain began to increase earlier  than the caspase-mediated  <dig> kda bdp , with greater accumulation of both breakdown products  after  <dig> hours . to further investigate the α-fodrin breakdown patterns produced by calpain or caspase- <dig>  the effects of calpain and caspase inhibitors on glutamate-induced cleavage of α-fodrin were investigated by immunoblotting. the presence of calpain inhibitor  <dig> μm alln reduced the formation of bdps  <dig> kda in primary cortical cells exposed to glutamate, but it had no effects on  <dig> kda bdp <dig> . however, the addition of caspase- <dig> specific inhibitor  <dig> μm z-devd completely inhibited the formation of  <dig> kda bdp, but had no effect on the formation of  <dig> kda bdps .

we have previously reported that primary cortical cells in culture for longer than  <dig> days display characteristic dna fragmentation. to further detect whether cellular mechanisms mediating this apoptotic process involve activation of these proteases, cleavage of α-fodrin was measured by using western blot analysis with cells from fresh tissue, day  <dig>  day  <dig>  day  <dig>  days  <dig> and  <dig> in culture . calpain-mediated cleavage of α-fodrin protein into  <dig> kda bdps could be seen on day  <dig> of culture  prior to the initiation of dna fragmentation . the activation further increased up to  <dig> days. caspase-3-dependent  <dig> kda bdp was detectable only after  <dig> days of culture. these data indicate that apoptosis occurs during the development of the neuronal cells  and is also associated with calpain and caspase- <dig> activation. the results further indicate that activation of calpain precedes the presence of apoptosis characterized by dna laddering and caspase- <dig> activity and suggest that calpain protease may be the first protease in mediating neuronal apoptosis.

effect of estrogens on the activation of calpain and caspase-3
we have previously reported that estrogens, 17β-estradiol  and Δ <dig> β-estradiol , protect against glutamate-induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner. ht <dig> cells were treated with  <dig> mm glutamate for 7– <dig> hours in the presence or absence of  <dig> μm and  <dig> μm 17β-e <dig> or Δ <dig> β-e <dig>  cell death was measured by ldh release assay and the results are summarized in figure 10a. both 17β-e <dig> and Δ <dig> β-e <dig> inhibited glutamate-induced cell death, with Δ <dig> β-e <dig> being more potent. thus, in the presence of 17β-e <dig>  only  <dig> μm 17β-e <dig> could significantly reduce cell death compared to glutamate alone . however, the presence of Δ <dig> β-e <dig>   <dig> μm or  <dig> μm, completely inhibited cell death and returned the release of ldh to control levels. in contrast, in primary cortical cells exposed to  <dig> mm glutamate for  <dig> hrs,  <dig> μm or  <dig> μm 17β-e <dig> or Δ <dig> β-e <dig> could completely protect against cell death . following measurement of ldh, inhibition by estrogens of glutamate-induced cleavage of α-fodrin in both cell types was determined by western blot analysis. in ht <dig> cells, the presence of  <dig> μm 17β-e <dig> and  <dig> μm Δ <dig> β-e <dig> in  <dig> mm glutamate for  <dig> hours significantly decreased glutamate-induced cleavage of α-fodrin into  <dig> kda bdp by 21% and 51%, respectively, compared to glutamate alone . however,  <dig> μm Δ <dig> β-e <dig> totally inhibited the formation of  <dig> kda bdp. moreover, in primary cortical cells exposed to glutamate  in the presence of estrogens  for  <dig> hours, estrogens not only inhibited calpain-mediated formation of  <dig> kda bdp, but also reduced caspase-3-mediated formation of  <dig> kda bdp . thus,  <dig> μm 17β-e <dig> significantly reduced breakdown products of  <dig> and  <dig> kda compared to glutamate alone. similarly,  <dig> μm 17β-e <dig> and  <dig> μm Δ <dig> β-e <dig> could completely prevent activation of calpain and caspase- <dig> proteases and totally block cleavage of α-fodrin. these data indicate that estrogens protect against glutamate-induced apoptotic cell death by inhibiting both calpain and caspase- <dig> activity in neuronal cells, with Δ <dig> β-e <dig> being more potent.

effects of glutamate and estrogens on protein levels of apoptosis inducing factor  in different cell fractions from two cell types
following the determination of calpain and caspase- <dig> protease's involvement in apoptotic cell death, regulation of mitochondrial apoptotic effector aif in cells undergoing apoptosis was determined in primary cortical cells and ht <dig> cells. protein levels in cytosol, mitochondria, nuclei and whole cell lysates were detected by western blot analysis. in cortical cells, treatment with glutamate  resulted in an increase in aif protein levels in the cytosol and nuclei in a time dependent-manner . concomitant with these changes, the levels of aif protein decreased in the mitochondria and no changes were found in whole cell lysates. the elevation of cytosolic and nuclear aif and its reduction in the mitochondria were associated with an increase in cell death. these results indicate that aif protein is released or translocates from mitochondria into cytosol and nuclei in primary cortical cells undergoing apoptotic cell death following exposure to glutamate. however, exposure of ht <dig> cells to glutamate  enhanced aif protein levels in all subcellular fractions of cells in a time-dependent manner that is also associated with glutamate-induced cell death. as shown in figure 12b, aif protein levels were increased not only in the cytosol and nuclei but also in the mitochondria and whole cell lysates. these data demonstrate that glutamate can upregulate aif protein levels in ht <dig> cells. whether translocation of aif is involved in this process requires further study. the presence of estrogens,  <dig> μm and  <dig> μm 17β-e2or Δ <dig> β-e <dig>  decreased glutamate-induced upregulation of aif in ht <dig> cells and reduced glutamate-induced aif release from mitochondria into cytosol in primary cortical cells. in ht <dig> cells,  <dig> μm 17β-e <dig> significantly decreased aif protein levels in whole cell lysates by 40% compared to glutamate alone. furthermore,  <dig> μm 17β-e <dig> and  <dig> μm Δ <dig> β-e <dig> could reverse glutamate-induced levels of aif to control values . similarly in primary cortical cells,  <dig> μm 17β-e <dig> and Δ <dig> β-e <dig> could significantly reduce the release of mitochondrial aif in cytosol by 30% and 50%, respectively compared to glutamate alone .

discussion
the objective of this study was to investigate the cellular mechanisms involved in glutamate-induced apoptotic cell death in neuronal cells. we used the mouse hippocampal cell line ht <dig> and primary fetal rat cortical cells to demonstrate that glutamate can induce neuronal apoptotic cell death by apoptotic mechanisms and that the process can be reversed or inhibited by equine estrogens such as 17β-e <dig> or Δ <dig> β-e <dig>  the results further indicate that glutamate-induced apoptotic cell death involves the activation of apoptotic proteases calpain and caspase- <dig> as well as upregulation and/or translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor  from mitochondria into cytosol and nuclei, where it causes nuclear condensation and apoptosis by a caspase-independent pathway  <cit> . our results reveal that in these two cell types, primary cortical cells and the ht <dig> cell line, cells display different patterns in regulating specific proteins involved in apoptosis. thus, in primary cortical cells, glutamate-induced apoptotic cell death is associated with activation of calpain and caspase- <dig>  which is in agreement with studies using different stimuli such as staurosporine  <cit> , and release of apoptosis-inducing factor  from mitochondria into cytosol and nuclei. however in the mouse hippocampal cell line ht <dig>  glutamate-induced apoptotic cell death involved calpain protease activity and upregulation of aif protein, but not caspase- <dig> activity. taken together, our data demonstrate that glutamate-induced apoptotic cell death in neuronal cells could be mediated by the apoptotic proteases calpain and caspase- <dig> as well as mitochondrial apoptosis effector aif via a caspase-dependent or caspase-independent apoptotic pathway that depends on the cell type. in ht <dig> cells, caspase- <dig> protein was not detectable and glutamate-induced cell death occurred without elevation of caspase- <dig> activity . caspase inhibitors, either the specific caspase- <dig> inhibitor devd or the pancaspase inhibitor z-vad, are not capable of protecting against glutamate-induced cell death in ht <dig> cells, while they do inhibit glutamate-induced cell death in primary cortical cells. in addition, glutamate-induced dna fragmentation  can be reduced or blocked by calpain inhibitors but not by caspase inhibitors in this cell line. these results strongly indicate that glutamate-induced apoptotic cell death in ht <dig> cells is executed through a caspase-independent pathway as has been observed in platelets  <cit> .

caspase- <dig> is considered a key executioner in the apoptotic cell death cascade and shares numerous substrates with ca2+-dependent protease calpain such as cytoskeletal protein α-fodrin in which they cleave different epitope sites once activated  <cit> . though they both are capable of executing apoptotic cell death, they appear to play different roles in this process. our results show that immunoblots probed with an anti-α-fodrin monoclonal antibody could detect intact α-fodrin  and  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda bdps  <cit> . treatment with glutamate induced accumulation of both  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda bdps in primary cortical cells, which could be reduced with both calpain inhibitor  and caspase- <dig> inhibitor . thus, calpain inhibition specifically protects against glutamate-induced production of  <dig> bdp and caspase- <dig> inhibition inhibits production of  <dig> bdp. there were no synergetic effects on glutamate-induced apoptotic cell death when these protease inhibitors were combined. these studies indicate that both calpain and caspase- <dig> are indeed activated, and their activation occurs sequentially and independently after cells undergo apoptosis, suggesting they may execute cell death to some extent by distinct mechanisms in primary cortical cells. there is no evidence showing that they have overlapping roles in cell death as described previously in neuronal or non-neuronal cells  <cit> . moreover, in ht <dig> cells, only calpain-mediated α-fodrin  <dig> kda bdp appeared after glutamate treatment, but  <dig> kda bdp generated specifically by caspase- <dig>  <cit>  could not be detected. furthermore, glutamate-induced cleavage of α-fodrin to  <dig> bdps could be reduced or blocked by calpain inhibitors, further indicating that glutamate-induced apoptosis is mediated by a calpain cascade via a caspase-independent pathway in ht <dig> cells. additional evidence for calpain's involvement in apoptotic cell death in central nervous system is supported by recent studies examining invivotraumatic brain injury tbi  <cit>  and ischemia in the rat heart  <cit> , in which calpain-mediated cleavage of α-fodrin and dna fragmentation have been detected following these insults.

calpain is a calcium-dependent neutral protease with two isoenzyme forms, μ-calpain and m-calpain, distinguished by their invitrocalcium requirements. calpain exists as a proenzyme in an inactive form in cytosol where the normal range of ca2+ concentration is 50– <dig> nm in resting cells  <cit> . an elevation of cytoplasmic free ca2+ concentration triggers calpain activation, which also depends upon the amount of calcium and site of activation. μ-calpain is activated in the presence of low micromolar levels of ca2+, and m-calpain requires millimolar ca2+ levels for its activation. after calpain is activated, it cleaves many cytoskeletal proteins and signaling molecules such as fodrin, filamine, neurofilament protein tau and tubulin  <cit> . fodrin  was found to be a specific calpain substrate  <cit> . in our studies, a calpain-mediated cleavage fragment of α-fodrin was observed in two cell types exposed to glutamate, as seen in the dystrophic neuritis and senile plaques in alzheimer's diseased brains  <cit> , suggesting that calpain could be a major apoptotic protease involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.

it has been reported that calpain could be activated in both necrotic and apoptotic conditions as observed in various neurological and neurodegenerative disorders, such as cerebral ischemia and glutamate toxicity  <cit> , while caspase- <dig> is only activated in neuronal apoptosis  <cit> . nevertheless, in our model systems, glutamate-induced cell death in ht <dig> cells was found to involve the mechanism of apoptosis  characterized by the presence of dna fragmentation  and morphological cell changes, and this process could be attenuated by calpain inhibitors and not caspase inhibitors. thus, in cortical cells, both  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda bdps were formed in untreated cells and cells treated with glutamate, which was also associated with dna fragmentation , and calpain-mediated  <dig> kda bdp accumulated to a greater extent than  <dig> bdp. furthermore, activation of calpain precedes that of caspase- <dig>  glutamate-induced ldh release  and dna fragmentation in these cells. taken together, our results strongly suggest that calpain, rather than caspase- <dig>  plays a critical role in mediating apoptosis characterized by oligonucleosomal dna fragmentation  and is a key apoptotic executioner in neuronal apoptosis, especially in ht <dig> cells. whether calpain activity is associated with necrosis needs to be investigated.

we have previously reported that glutamate induces cytochrome c release from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm where it activates caspase- <dig> and causes apoptotic cell death in primary cortical cells via a caspase-dependent pathway  <cit> . in the present paper, we show that apoptosis inducing factor , normally confined in the mitochondria, is also released into the cytosol and nuclei in primary cortical cells undergoing apoptosis and upregulation of aif also occurs in ht <dig> cells after glutamate treatment. in contrast to cytochrome c, aif acts in a caspase-independent fashion  <cit> . aif is a ubiquitously expressed flavoprotein with significant homology to bacterial oxidoreductases and has nadh oxidase activity  <cit> . under normal circumstances, transcription and translation of nuclear aif gene give rise to a precursor molecule  that carries a putative mitochondrial localization sequence in its nh <dig> terminus  <cit> . upon import into the mitochondrial intermembrane space, this  <dig> amino acid precursor is cleaved by a local peptidase leading to generation of the mature aif molecule . when apoptotic cell death is induced, aif translocates through the outer mitochondrial membrane to the cytosol and nucleus, where it leads to nuclear chromatin condensation and a large-scale dna fragmentation  and apoptosis in a caspase-independent manner  <cit> . recent studies show that microinjection of mature aif and precursor aif can both induce chromatin condensation and cell death  <cit> . it was further found that transfection enforced overexpression of the wild type precursor aif  also diminishes the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane , induces aif release from the mitochondria and causes apoptosis. based on these studies, glutamate-induced overexpression of aif in ht <dig> cells might also trigger aif release or translocation from the mitochondria into the cytosol and nuclei. this process needs to be further elucidated. taken together with previous studies, our data indicate that glutamate exerts its toxic action through two parallel pathways: a caspase-dependent pathway mediated by caspase- <dig>  the final apoptotic effector, and a caspase- <dig> independent apoptotic pathway involving the upregulation of aif and/or mitochondrial aif release as well as calpain-modulated effects .

we have previously reported that a number of equine estrogens, which are components of the drug cee used extensively for management of vasomotor symptoms and osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, are potent antioxidants and protect neuronal cells against cell death induced by oxidized ldl or glutamate  <cit> . our current findings indicate that estrogens prevent glutamate-induced cell death by reducing the upregulation and/or translocation of aif from the mitochondria into the cytosol as well as by attenuating activity of calpain and caspase- <dig> in primary cortical cells and ht <dig> cells, with Δ <dig>  17β-estradiol being more potent than 17β-estradiol. although neurotoxic effects of oxidized ldl and glutamate can be inhibited differentially by various estrogens,  <cit> , the data presented in this paper, to our knowledge, represents the first comprehensive analysis of the involvement of multiple apoptotic proteins in glutamate-induced apoptosis in different neuronal cells that can be differentially inhibited by equine estrogens. recent studies have shown that estrogen can decrease calpain activity in rat c <dig> glial cells treated with h2o <dig> and in ischemic muscle  <cit> . the regulation by estrogens on the translocation of apoptotic effectors from the mitochondria into the cytosol such as cytochrome c and the activation of caspase- <dig> has been discussed in previous reports in which estrogens might directly modulate the mitochondrial ca2+ content and mitochondrial trans-membrane potential  <cit> . as the estrogen receptor has been shown to be a substrate of calpain, estrogen-mediated reduction of calpain activity may prevent degradation of the ers, and enable receptor-mediated events to proceed by genomic mechanism  <cit> . whereas in ht <dig> cells lacking estrogen receptors, estrogen effects are most-likely mediated to some extent by non-genomic mechanism  <cit> . it may also be related to an effect on voltage-gated ca2+ channels and reduced post-injury influx of ca2+  <cit> . it has been reported that estrogen treatment can attenuate ca2+ influx in cultured neurons  <cit> . however, our earlier findings indicate that estrogens protected primary cortical cells against glutamate induced excitotoxicity by a mechanism that appears to be independent of ca2+ influx  <cit> . in this study in primary cultures of cortical neurons, we investigated the glutamate-induced excitotoxicity by exposing the neurons to μm concentration of glutamate for only  <dig> minutes. the results from this study indicated that glutamate-induced cell death occurs through nmda receptors and nos-linked mechanism independent of ca2+ influx and this form of cell death was also prevented by estrogens. a recent study  <cit>  has confirmed our latter observations in neuronal cells derived from fetal rat brains, however, these investigators also used middle aged and old rats neurons where there was a profound loss of calcium homeostasis more so in the older age group. these observations indicate that neurons from older rats are more sensitive to glutamate toxicity, however, as in neurons from fetal brains, estrogens were also able to protect these older neurons. whether the role of calpain, caspase- <dig> and aif is altered in cortical neurons derived from older animals remains to be investigated.

pre-treatment of these neurons with 17β-estradiol prior to exposure to glutamate attenuate and delay the adverse effects on intracellular ca2+ homeostasis. whether the role of calpain, caspase- <dig> and aif is altered in cortical neurons derived from older rat brains remains to be investigated. our observations further suggest that the neuroprotective effects of estrogens can involve both genomic and non-genomic mechanisms that depend on the neuronal cell type and the cytotoxin used to induce apoptosis.

recently, bano et al  <cit>  reported that the na+/ca2+ exchanger  which under normal physiological conditions, transports na+ ions into the cell and ca2+ out, is destroyed by ca2+-activated calpain under ischaemic conditions. this proteolytic inactivation of ncx could allow further accumulation of ca2+ or delay its elimination, that ultimately results in the destruction of the neurons. whether glutamate induced ca2+ influx and the activation of calpain observed in our neuronal cells also results in the inactivation of ncx that can be prevented by estrogen remains to be investigated.

although our present data and those of a number of previous studies  <cit>  indicate that calpains play a critical role in mediating apoptotic cell death, others indicate that in cerebellar granule cells and rat fetal hippocampal neurons activation of nmda receptors is necessary for calpain- <dig> activation but no association between calpain activation and glutamate-induced cell death was observed  <cit> . differences between these observations could be due to several factors such as cell type, primary cell cultures or stable cell line cultures, tissue culture conditions, source of cells , age of cultures, purity of cultures concentration and duration  of glutamate exposure, nature of the neurotoxin used, and extent of ca2+ influx  <cit> . along with these, a number of additional differences have been indicated  <cit> . further detailed studies are needed to delineate the role of calpains in glutamate-induced apoptotic neuronal cell death in clearly defined model systems. it is also important to recognize that at least two distinct pathways for glutamate-induced cell death have been described: the excitotoxic pathway and the oxidative pathway. the excitotoxic pathway involves the overactivation of glutamate receptors that leads to both rapid and slowly triggered cytotoxic events. the rapid effects involve the activation of the nmda receptor and leads to a large ca2+ influx that is detrimental to cell viability. the oxidative pathway involves the breakdown of the glutamate-cystine antiporter and a drop in glutathione levels that allows for aberrant formation of reactive oxygen species  that are neurotoxic  <cit> . in most of our studies, we and a number of other investigators have used higher concentration  and exposed the cultures to longer exposure times  to glutamate. under these conditions, we usually get  <dig> to 50% cell death. this cell death occurs most likely by mechanism distinct from excitotoxicity induced by acute exposure of neurons to μm concentrations of glutamate. we think as indicated in the first sentence in the background it is the high concentrations  of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate that accumulates in the aging brain that may play a role in neurodegeneration associated with normal aging. in contrast, in acute trauma to the brain, excitotoxicity may be the key factor. in our recent study  <cit>  in primary cultures of cortical neurons, we investigated the glutamate-induced excitotoxicity by exposing the neurons to μm concentration of glutamate for only  <dig> minutes. the results from this study indicated that glutamate-induced cell death occurs through nmda receptors and nos-linked mechanism independent of ca2+ influx and this form of cell death was also prevented by estrogens. thus, depending on the objectives of the study, we have used different concentrations of glutamate. important to note that in ht <dig> cells, nmda receptors are absent and therefore this form of excitotoxicity may not occur in these types of neuronal cells.

since in our study both nmda receptor and estrogen receptor positive  and negative  cells were used, the results therefore indicate that at least two different mechanisms are involved in the activation of calpains. which of these mechanisms is involved in neurodegenerative diseases such as alzheimer's remains to be investigated. it is likely that in the aging brain, neurons are more sensitive to chronically high levels  of glutamate that can result in the activation of calpains and the initiation of neurodegenerative process. over time, the caspase- <dig> system is also activated leading to a higher degree of apoptotic neuronal cell death and progression of the disease process. the demonstration that equine estrogens can prevent the activation of both types of proteases, provides an avenue of developing new therapeutic interventions for the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases.

CONCLUSIONS
our present studies demonstrate that at least two mechanisms are involved in glutamate-induced apoptosis: a caspase-dependent pathway via a caspase- <dig> cascade and a caspase-independent pathway involving calpain protease and aif-mediated apoptosis. since ht <dig> cells lack caspase- <dig> protein and activity, glutamate-induced apoptosis is mediated via the caspase-independent pathway in this particular cell line. our data also suggest that calpain, rather than caspase- <dig>  plays a critical role in the neuronal intracellular pathway leading to glutamate-induced apoptosis. our studies further indicate that glutamate-induced changes in these apoptotic proteins can be inhibited by estrogens, with Δ <dig> β-estradiol, a novel equine estrogen being more potent than 17β-estradiol. to our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that glutamate-induced apoptosis involves regulation of multiple apoptotic effectors that can be inhibited by estrogens. these data provide an insight into the development of potential novel therapeutic approaches for the prevention of neurodegenerative disease with estrogens and calpain inhibitors.
