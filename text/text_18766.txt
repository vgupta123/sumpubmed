BACKGROUND
lipoprotein lipase  hydrolyses triglycerides in chylomicrons and vldl and thereby makes fatty acids available for cellular uptake and use in metabolic processes  <cit> . relatively high levels of lpl mrna are found in adipose tissue, heart, red skeletal muscle and lactating mammary gland  <cit> . parenchymal cells, such as adipocytes and myocytes, synthesize and secrete the enzyme, which is then transferred to the endothelium and anchored to the oligosaccharide chains of heparan sulfate proteoglycans   <cit> . there is continuous recycling of the enzyme between the luminal and abluminal side of the endothelial cells, and perhaps to other extracellular sites in the tissue  <cit> . it is not known how the extracellular enzyme is turned over. one possibility is that it is transported with blood to the liver and degraded there  <cit> . lpl activity in the circulating blood is normally low and most of the lpl protein in blood is catalytically inactive  <cit> . release of lipase from extrahepatic tissues into blood has been demonstrated  <cit> . model studies with labeled lpl have demonstrated uptake and degradation of both active and inactive lpl in the liver  <cit> .

heparin releases lpl from its endothelial binding sites into the circulating blood. the uptake in the liver is retarded, but not abolished  <cit> . this has been taken as evidence that there are both heparin-sensitive and heparin-insensitive binding sites in the liver. an implication is that the high lipase activity in blood after heparin injection is due to release from peripheral tissues combined with retarded uptake in the liver. studies in rats and in human subjects indicate that the net effect of heparin is an accelerated transport of lpl to the liver  <cit> . if this hypothesis is correct, lpl mass and activity should increase in the liver after injection of heparin, in contrast to the decrease that occurs in extrahepatic tissues  <cit> . to test these concepts we have followed lpl activity and mass in liver after injection of heparin, and we have used immunofluorescence to explore if heparin changes the pattern of where in the liver lpl binds.

RESULTS
amount and distribution of lpl in liver
lpl activity in rat liver was  <dig> Â±  <dig> mu/g , similar to the activity reported by peterson et al  <cit> . this is low compared to the activities in adipose tissue  and heart . lpl mass was  <dig> ng/g. the relation between lpl activity and mass in plasma was similar to that in liver; activity was  <dig> mu/ml and mass was  <dig> ng/ml . the specific activity of the enzyme in plasma increased to around  <dig>  after injection of heparin. this indicates that most of the lpl in plasma or liver before heparin was inactive, in accord with studies on lpl in human plasma  <cit> .

to study the distribution of endogenous lpl in rat liver we used affinity-purified chicken antibodies raised against bovine lpl. these antibodies have previously been used for elisa of lpl in rat tissues  <cit> . there was faint immunofluorescence in a granular pattern  over hepatocytes, and stronger staining over scattered cells . some of these reacted positively with the ed <dig> antibodies indicating that they were kupffer cells. sections treated with pre-immune igg instead of anti-lpl , as well as sections where the second antibody was omitted, showed no immunofluorescence.

effects of heparin
lpl activity and mass in plasma increased many-fold after heparin injection . the highest value was at  <dig> min, but even after  <dig> min the activity was still more then 50-fold higher than in normal plasma. in liver the level of lpl activity had increased already two min after heparin injection and it was about 10-fold increased both at  <dig> and  <dig> min compared to time  <dig>  the amount of lpl protein in the liver, measured by the elisa, had increased about two-fold at two min,  <dig> -fold at  <dig> min and five-fold after  <dig> min. these data give direct evidence that after injection of heparin some of the lpl released into plasma was taken up by the liver.

hepatic lipase  was also measured in the livers . as expected, but in sharp contrast to what was found for lpl, the hl activity decreased after heparin. already after two min the activity had decreased by two thirds. this reflects the release of hl into the circulating blood. the activity in liver remained constant at  <dig> min and had begun to increase again after  <dig> min.

the pattern of immunofluorescence for lpl after heparin was similar to that before heparin, with faint staining over most cells and more intense staining over scattered cells, some of which were ed <dig> positive .

to explore the origin of the lpl released into plasma and taken up by the liver we measured lpl activity in heart and adipose tissue before and  <dig> min after injection of heparin . data for plasma and liver in fed rats were similar to those in the experiment in table  <dig>  in fasted rats, plasma post-heparin lpl activity was less than half of that in fed rats in accord with previous studies  <cit> . the lpl activity in liver increased after heparin, in concert with the results in table  <dig>  there was no statistically significant difference of the lpl activity in liver between fed and fasted rats either before or after heparin. in adipose tissue the lpl activity was about 5-fold higher in fed compared to fasted rats. heparin caused a washout of  <dig> % of the lpl activity from epididymal and 65% from perirenal adipose tissue . values for lpl activity in heart were somewhat higher in fasted than in fed rats, but this did not reach statistical significance . heparin caused no significant decrease of heart lpl in fed rats, but a highly significant  washout in the fasted rats, about 40%.

injection of labelled bovine lpl
the immunostaining of endogeneous lpl was faint and not suitable for detailed analysis or quantitation. the reason is that the only reagents available were chicken antibodies raised against bovine lpl. to further explore the hepatic binding and uptake of the enzyme we therefore injected bovine lpl. a trace amount of 125i-labeled lpl was included so that we could quantitate the uptake/metabolism. values are given in table  <dig> for the times at which localization of the lipase was studied by immunofluorescence. these values agree with an earlier study when more complete time curves were obtained  <cit> . for active lpl earlier studies have shown that at short times after injection about half of the lipase locates in extrahepatic tissues and about half in the liver  <cit> . in the present study  <dig> % of the radioactivity was in liver after two min . this increased to  <dig> % after  <dig> min and then decreased again to  <dig> % after  <dig> min. heparin slows down the clearance of lpl from the blood  <cit> . fifteen min after injection of the labeled lipase, about half is still in the circulating blood  <cit> . in our experiments  <dig> % was in the liver at this time . hence,  <dig> % or more of the removal from plasma had taken place in the liver. after  <dig> min radioactivity in the liver had decreased to  <dig> % of the injected dose . earlier studies have demonstrated that acid soluble breakdown products of the labeled lipase appear in blood  <cit>  and in the perfusion fluid in experiments with isolated livers  <cit> . hence, the decrease of label in liver at longer times probably occurred through degradation of the lipase.

for inactive lipase earlier studies have shown that only a minor fraction locates in extrahepatic tissues, and more than 70% of the uptake occurs in the liver  <cit> . in the present study,  <dig> % of the radioactivity was in the liver  <dig> min after injection, while  <dig> % was in the blood. after  <dig> min the radioactivity in the liver had decreased to  <dig> % of the injected dose.

to visualize the injected bovine lpl we used rabbit antibodies. these antibodies did not inhibit endogenous lpl in rat post-heparin plasma or in extracts of adipose tissue. no immuno-reaction was seen in sections from control rats not injected with lpl . likewise, there was no immunofluorescence in sections treated with non-immune rabbit igg instead of anti-lpl, or when the second antibody was omitted.

two min after injection of the active lipase, intense immuno-staining was seen along sinusoids . this staining was strongest in the periportal areas. there was little staining outside the sinusoids. occasionally a few fluorescent dots were seen in hepatocytes, possibly representing endocytic vesicles. at  <dig> min after injection there was still staining over the sinusoids , but most of the staining was now associated with hepatocytes and the number of granulae seen in hepatocytes had increased, indicating that the lipase had been internalized in vesicles . some cells, localized predominantly around the portal area, had many fluorescent dots. this staining was mainly granular in contrast to the more continuous staining over sinusoids at this time. double staining at  <dig> min after injection of lpl demonstrated that some of these cells were ed2-positive . at  <dig> min little or no staining remained at sinusoidal surfaces and the total staining had decreased , but there were still grains in cells close to the portal area. this was probably enzyme that had been taken up in intracellular vesicles and had not yet become degraded.

to get more detailed information about the binding sites in liver we used electron microscopy. for this, bovine 125i-labeled lpl was injected and  <dig> min later the livers were fixed by perfusion. the enzyme was visualized as silver grains by means of autoradiography . counting of silver grains in the sections showed that about 55% of the lipase was within spaces of disse, mostly associated with hepatocytes. twenty-five to 30% was on the luminal side of endothelial cells. only about 15% was inside hepatocytes and other cell types, probably kupffer cells.

the pattern of distribution was quite different for the inactive lipase. at the first time, two min, there was intense staining for lpl over scattered cells concentrated to the portal regions but very little staining over sinusoids or hepatocytes . double staining with the ed <dig> antibody showed that the intensively lpl-positive cells were kupffer cells. after  <dig> min the immunofluorescence had changed to a more punctuate pattern that still co-localized with kupffer cells . this indicated that the lipase had been internalized in vesicles. there was some immunostaining over other cells, presumably hepatocytes, but this was much weaker than the staining over kupffer cells . after  <dig> min the intensity of the staining had decreased, but the pattern with more intense staining over kupffer cells and much weaker staining over other cells remained . hence, there was no indication that the inactive lipase first bound to one type of cell and then transferred to another type for uptake. electron microscopic autoradiography of sections from livers of rats ten min after injection the inactive lpl, confirmed that the labelled lipase was mostly associated to sinusoidal cells that morphologically seemed to resemble kupffer cells.

heparin markedly changed the pattern of localization for the active lipase. the initial  staining along the sinusoids was much weaker than in sections from rats that had not received heparin. the staining was generally more intense at  <dig> min compared to at two min after injection of the lipase . this is in accord with the radioactivity data that showed that more lpl had been taken up . compared to the pattern without heparin, the staining was spread throughout the liver parenchyma rather than concentrated in the portal areas . there was more staining associated with scattered cells in the portal areas than in sections from rats that had not received heparin . these cells were ed2-positive . already at  <dig> min the lpl-staining had taken on a granular character both in the ed2-positive cells and in hepatocytes . at  <dig> min the intensity of staining had decreased . the ed <dig> positive cells still dominated the picture but there was also granular staining over hepatocytes. more staining remained compared to the same time point without heparin .

electron microscopic autoradiography showed that when heparin was injected ten min after active lpl there was a strong reduction in the amount of lpl in the spaces of disse and on endothelial cells, while the radioactivity found in hepatocytes and kupffer cells remained .

heparin had no marked effect on the distribution of the inactive lpl . most of the staining co-localized with staining for ed <dig> positive kupffer cells .

discussion
this study shows that after injection of heparin, lpl activity and mass in liver increases several-fold, in concert with the hypothesis that heparin causes accelerated transport of lpl to the liver. in other parts of the body lpl is attached to hspg  <cit> . heparin competes efficiently with these binding sites. the rapid extraction of lpl by the liver in the presence of heparin implies that some other type of binding site must be present there. members of the ldl receptor  family bind both the active and the inactive form of the lipase  <cit>  and two recent studies indicate that lrp is involved in hepatic uptake of lpl  <cit> . the binding of active lpl to lrp is, however, strongly impeded by heparin  <cit> . therefore, it is unlikely that the heparin-resistant binding of active lpl is mediated by lrp or some other receptor of the ldl-r family.

heparin markedly decreased the binding of lpl along the sinusoids. this presumably reflects that binding to hspg was competed by heparin. staining associated with kupffer-like cells increased. this may be the same sites as those that bind inactive lpl. another possibility is that the lpl-heparin complexes were recognized and taken up as such. there is evidence for binding and uptake of heparin by kupffer cells  <cit> . most of the binding was, however, to hepatocytes even in the presence of heparin. our data are qualitative, based on the immunolocalization. for more accurate quantitation one should label the lipase with a non-degradable label like 125i-tyramine cellobiose and isolate the different cell types.

it has been suggested that lpl and hl bind, at least in part, to the same sites in the liver  <cit> . it is, however, unlikely that hl shares the heparin-insensitive sites. the response of the two enzymes to heparin was very different. hl activity decreased by 60% within two min after heparin injection, reflecting release of the lipase into blood. in contrast, lpl activity in the liver increased, reflecting binding to the heparin-insensitive sites.

earlier studies have shown that there are also heparin-sensitive sites that bind lpl in liver  <cit> . wallinder et al perfused livers in situ with heparin  <dig> min after injection of 125i-lpl to rats and found that about 10% of the lipase that had bound in the liver could be released  <cit> . vilarÃ³ et al perfused isolated livers with 125i-lpl in a recirculating system for  <dig> min. after wash the perfusion was then continued in single pass mode with a heparin-containing medium. about 50% of the lpl that had bound in the liver reappeared in the perfusion medium within four min  <cit> . at least some of these heparin-sensitive sites are likely hspg, and they are probably the main sites that mediate the initial capture of lpl from blood. this binding may correspond to the decoration of the sinusoids seen by immunofluorescence at the earliest time after injection of the lipase. hspg are present on virtually all cells in the body, including hepatocytes and endothelial cells in the liver  <cit> . vilarÃ³ et al studied binding and uptake of lpl in cultured hepatocytes  <cit> . the enzyme was concentrated at the tips of the microvilli, a site where also hspg are highly abundant  <cit> . immunofluorescence now showed that at short times after injection the lipase located along the sinusoids, and electron microscopy showed that most of the lipase was in the spaces of disse. the immunofluorescence was strongest in the portal areas, indicating that the lipase was extracted soon after it entered the liver. most of the staining was over hepatocytes. with time the immunofluorescence shifted to a granular pattern, indicating that the enzyme had been internalized. the internalization may have occurred with lipase bound to hspg, as demonstrated with cultured fibroblasts and with hepatocytes  <cit>  and/or with lipase bound to lrp as suggested by several authors  <cit> . in fibroblasts, both these pathways contribute to lpl internalization  <cit> . the lipase may well recycle as demonstrated by heeren et al in experiments with cultured hepatocytes  <cit> . the immunostaining gradually faded with time indicating that the lipase was degraded, in accord with previous studies, and with the decrease of 125i-radioactivity in the liver observed in the present study.

inactive lpl, as prepared here, was taken up in kupffer cells. most of the lpl in plasma is inactive  <cit>  and there is inactive lpl also in the tissues  <cit> . the nature and metabolic significance of this inactive lpl is not clear. western blot analysis indicates that it is full-length lpl  <cit> . on heparin-agarose it elutes in the position expected for monomeric lpl  <cit> . gel filtration of plasma indicates that it is associated with the lipoproteins  <cit> . the turnover of inactive lpl does not appear to be much influenced by heparin  <cit> . earlier studies had shown that injected, inactive lpl is rapidly bound and degraded in the liver, both in vivo  <cit>  and on perfusion through an isolated liver  <cit> . in these studies the inactive lipase was produced by complete denaturation in  <dig> m guanidinium chloride. in the present study the inactive lipase was gently prepared by incubation in rat plasma at 45Â°c. this probably results in dissociation to inactive but still folded monomers  <cit> . our preliminary experiments had shown that under these conditions the enzyme slowly lost its catalytic activity. after  <dig> min, the time used here, less than  <dig> % of the activity remained. in terms of clearance rate and tissue distribution, the present preparation behaved as the fully denatured lipase used in previous studies. whether any of these lipase preparations faithfully reproduces the metabolic behaviour of the inactive lipase present in plasma is not clear. a recent study has defined several conformational states of the lpl molecule, and the kinetics of conformational transitions  <cit> .

before heparin, the ratio of lpl activity to lpl mass was about  <dig>  mu/ng in liver and  <dig>  mu/ng in blood . after heparin, the specific activity for lpl in plasma increased to about  <dig> , indicating that heparin released mainly or almost exclusively the active form of the lipase as has been shown to be the case in humans  <cit> . in the liver, however, the ratio stayed well below one. at the  <dig> min time point lpl mass had increased by about  <dig> ng/g, but lpl activity had only increased by about  <dig> mu. this indicates that the lipase loses catalytic activity after it is taken up in the liver, but is degraded more slowly. these observations are in accord with earlier studies. chajek-shaul et al. perfused rat livers with lpl-containing media and found that the enzyme lost its catalytic activity soon after binding/uptake in liver  <cit> . wallinder et al compared the uptake and degradation of 125i-labeled lpl in liver to that for asialofetuin, which is taken up by the galactose receptor  <cit> . the half-life for asialofetuin was about  <dig> min, whereas that for the lipase was longer, about one hour.

to explore the source of lpl released into plasma and taken up by the liver we measured lpl activity in adipose tissue and heart before and after injection of heparin. in fed rats there was a large decrease of lpl activity in adipose tissue, in accord with a previous study  <cit> . from these data and the tissue weights at least  <dig> mu lpl activity was washed out from white adipose tissue during the first  <dig> min after heparin. to this should be added an unknown amount of lpl washed out from other tissues. during the same time the lpl activity increased by the  <dig> mu in the liver and about  <dig> mu in blood. these data indicate that the dominant source of lpl released to plasma in fed rats is the white adipose tissue. post-heparin lpl activity was lower in fasted than in fed rats, less than half, in accord with previous studies  <cit> . lpl activity in adipose tissue is suppressed during fasting, and we did not find any significant loss of activity after heparin. hence, the adipose tissue releases much less lpl activity into plasma in fasted than in fed rats. the main contributors are presumably heart and skeletal muscle. we observed a large washout of lpl activity from heart in the fasted rats, about 40%. in other studies we have noted a similar washout from the soleus muscle. kuwajima et al perfused some of the rat hindlimb muscles  with heparin in situ and observed a large release in fasted but not in fed rats  <cit> . these data suggest that in fasted rats, the main source of lpl released into plasma by heparin are skeletal muscles and heart.

lpl in plasma is bound to lipoproteins and it has been suggested that the lipase serves as a ligand for binding and uptake of lipoproteins in the liver. chevreuil et al injected doubly labelled chylomicrons to rats shortly after heparin  <cit> . the results showed accelerated lipolysis of the triglyceride moiety of the chylomicrons, as expected. in addition, clearance of chylomicron remnants, as traced by retinyl esters, was greatly accelerated. together with the present results this suggests that after heparin, the large increase of lpl in blood may accelerate the hepatic uptake of some lipoproteins.

CONCLUSIONS
â¢ in the liver, the active form of lpl initially binds to sinusoidal surfaces but then transfers to and is taken up mainly in hepatocytes

â¢ an inactive form of lpl, presumably monomers, was mainly taken up in kupffer cells

â¢ heparin retards the uptake of active lpl in liver, but there are heparin insensitive binding sites for lpl both on hepatocytes and on kupffer cells

â¢ release of lpl into blood by heparin results in accelerated transport of the lipase to the liver

â¢ the observation that rat liver contained substantial amounts of lpl, most of which was inactive, is in accord with the hypothesis that one route for turnover for endothelial lpl is transport to and degradation in the liver

â¢ the observations that most of the lpl in blood is inactive, that injected inactive bovine lpl located to kupffer cells, and that the immunostaining for endogenous lpl was more intense over kupffer cells than over hepatocytes suggest that a substantial fraction of the transport from extrahepatic tissues occurs with lpl that has lost its activity.

â¢ the main source of lpl released into plasma and taken up by the liver in fed rats is the adipose tissue, whereas in fasted rats the main sources are heart and skeletal muscles.
