BACKGROUND
most of the proteins currently employed for therapeutic use are produced by stably transfected mammalian cells, of which the most popular is the chinese hamster ovary  cell line. establishing highly productive clonal cell lines that exhibit constant productivity over a 2– <dig> month period of continuous culture remains a tedious task, requiring tens of thousands of clonal colonies to be screened, followed by the long-term cultivation of candidate lines in the absence of an appropriate selection pressure. generally, the expression levels of a target gene may be increased by its amplification in the genome  <cit> , which is usually achieved by linking the target gene to the murine dihydrofolate reductase  gene with stepwise increases in the concentration of the dhfr inhibitor, methotrexate , in the selection medium.

target gene amplification is a time-consuming process, resulting in cell populations that often contain unstable clones, and in the absence of an appropriate selection pressure, reduced production levels. the probability of obtaining a highly productive clonal cell line can be increased significantly by utilizing plasmids based on non-coding parts of the elongation factor- <dig> alpha gene  from chinese hamster, as described by running deer and allison  <cit> . expression vector pdef <dig>  introduced by these authors, differs significantly from the widely employed vectors with the core promoter of the human ortholog elongation factor  <dig> alpha gene . eef1a-based expression vector includes  <dig>  kb upstream and  <dig>  kb downstream flanking areas of the eef1a gene, so the orf of the of the target gene replaces the coding exons of the elongation factor  <dig> alpha protein in the natural eef1a gene, mimicking with all possible accuracy the structure of the natural gene in the resulting expression plasmid. it was shown that presence of both flanking areas in the eef1a-based vectors results in the 6- to 35- fold increase of the average expression level comparing to commercial vectors with cmv or ef1alpha promoters. removal of the downstream flanking area from the expression vector resulted in the 4-fold drop in the expression level.

original expression vector pdef <dig> contained the dhfr selection marker with a separate sv <dig> promoter and was not tested for its ability to support target gene amplification under gradually increasing mtx pressure. dhfr-compatible vectors, bearing the neomycin resistance gene instead of the dhfr gene, were also described in the same work. existing eef1a-based vectors, despite their high promoter strength and their long-term production level stability, do not accommodate very large plasmid sizes. consequently, this can result in low-level genome integration and inability to maintain the target gene amplification step, possibly as a result of vector fragmentation and autonomous amplification of the dhfr-coding area.

since eef1a-based vectors are much longer than cmv-based vectors, they are expected to have lower transfection efficiency and, subsequently, lower numbers of stably transfected cells. it was shown, that the insertion the concatemer fragment of the epstein-barr virus terminal repeats   <cit>  in the expression vectors increase the rate of stably transfected colonies formation by five to ten fold  <cit> . the molecular mechanism of this effect is poorly understood. it is known that g-rich repeats in the ebvtr bind to the cellular protein terminal repeat binding protein   <cit>  and at least two binding sites of trbp were identified in the repetitive cellular dna  <cit> . ebvtr areas are involved in the integration of the epstein-barr virus into the chromosomal dna  <cit> . ebv-infected cells may harbour the virus in the chromosome-integrated form, as the independently replicating episome or the mixture of both forms  <cit> . region of the ebv, called orip, maintains the episomal replication of the ebv genome, interacts with the ebv-encoded nuclear antigen- <dig>  and allows ebv plasmids to separate in mitosis through binding to chromosomes  <cit> . ebvtr concatemer used for enhancement of expression plasmids, however, contains no sequences from the orip region and no dna fragments with significant homology toward orip region, so the ebna- <dig> – mediated persistence of the ebvtr-containing plasmid as the episome in the transfected cells is highly unlikely.

we hypothesized that significant improvements to eef1a-based vectors might be achieved by: 1) inserting the ebvtr element outside of the eef1a flanking dna; 2) linking the dhfr open reading frame to the target gene by the internal ribosome entry site  thereby preventing the possibility of separate amplification of the selection marker; 3) reducing of the length of the backbone dna, which is necessary for maintaining the plasmid in the bacterial host. similar improvements might be applied to dhfr-compatible eef1a-based vectors used for monocistronic expression of a target gene; in this case by placing the antibiotic resistance genes outside the context of the non-coding parts of the elongation factor  <dig> alpha gene, which might decrease genetic linkage between the selection marker and the target gene.

here, we report on the functional properties of eef1a-based plasmid vectors for bicistronic and monocistronic expression. we also describe the corresponding methods for obtaining highly productive and stable cell lines that maintain constant productivity levels after genome amplification of the integrated plasmid, utilizing the dhfr-negative cell line cho dg <dig>  <cit> . in addition, we used the enhanced green fluorescent protein  as a model target protein, and show egfp accumulation inside cho cells.

methods
molecular cloning
the sequences of the primers used for cloning expression plasmids are shown in additional file 1: table s <dig>  the backbone vector, pbl- <dig>  was obtained by two stages of inverted pcr using long adapter primers and the puc <dig> plasmid as a template. non-functional parts of the plasmid including the plac promoter and the lacz gene were removed. inverted pcr was performed as described previously  <cit> . oligonucleotides and pcr reagents were from evrogen, jsc . pcr products were purified from 1% agarose gels by the wizard sv gel and pcr clean-up system . t <dig> polynucleotide kinase and mali restriction endonuclease  were used. t <dig> dna ligase  was used for inverted pcr product circularization. the escherichia coli top <dig> strain  was used for cloning. plasmids were isolated with a genejet plasmid purification kit .

the pal-ebv plasmid, containing a fragment of a concatemer of ebv terminal repeats, as described previously  <cit>  and nearly undistinguishable from the human herpes virus  <dig> strain k4123-miebv sequence  was made from synthetic oligonucleotides cloned into a pal-ta  vector. the orf encoding mouse dhfr was obtained by pcr using poptivec-topo linearized vector  as a template. the fragment encoding the attenuated encephalomyocarditis virus  ires was obtained from the poptivec-circ plasmid  by restriction. these fragments were cloned into the pbl- <dig> plasmid via assembly of two different intermediate constructs, pbl-2-id and pbl-2-id-ebv. dna modification enzymes for routine molecular cloning were obtained from fermentas or sibenzyme.

construction of p <dig>  vectors
fragments corresponding to the upstream and downstream flanking regions  of the cho elongation factor  <dig> gene were obtained by pcr using cho dg <dig> cell  genomic dna as a template. the modular assembly cloning technique used herein is described in detail elsewhere  <cit> .assembled cho genomic regions were cloned into the intermediate plasmids, pbl-2-id and pbl-2-id-ebv, resulting in p <dig>  and p <dig>  expression vectors, respectively .

construction of p <dig>  vectors
p <dig> -mono, the intermediate backbone plasmid for expression vectors bearing antibiotic resistance genes was obtained by removal of the region containing the emcv ires and the dhfr orf from the p <dig>  expression vector. plasmid pal-3ch <dig>  containing first three modules of the downstream flanking region of the eef1a was used as the source of the donor dna insert fragment, replacing the deleted ires and dhfr area, so both flanking regions of the eef1a remained unaltered . antibiotic resistance genes and the sv <dig> promoter and terminator regions were obtained by amplification with adaptor primers, using pcdna <dig> /hygro, pcdna <dig> , and self-ligated pcdna4/hismax-topo  as pcr templates. antibiotic resistance cassettes were sub-cloned into t-vectors and then transferred into the p <dig> -mono backbone by restriction-ligation resulting in p <dig> -hygro, p <dig> -neo and p <dig> -zeo. a dna fragment encoding egfp and a consensus kozak sequence   <cit>  was obtained by pcr with adaptor primers and the pegfp-c <dig> plasmid  as a template and then cloned into the polylinker area of p <dig>  and p <dig>  vectors, thereby resulting in p <dig> egfp, p <dig> egfp, p <dig> -hygroegfp, p <dig> -neoegfp and p <dig> -zeoegfp expression plasmids.

purified plasmids for transfection and the control plasmid pegfp-n <dig>  were prepared using an endofree plasmid maxi kit . for stable cell line generation all plasmids except p <dig> -hygroegfp were linearized by restriction with pvui by cutting inside the ampicillin resistance gene bla sequence. the plasmid p <dig> -hygroegfp was restricted with bsphi, which introduced two breaks near the bla gene.

cell culture
a dhfr-negative cho dg <dig> cell line  was cultured in shaking flasks in the chemically defined medium, cd dg <dig> , supplemented with  <dig> % pluronic f- <dig>  and 4 mm l-glutamine . the cells were passaged 24 h before transfection. for direct colony generation in 96-well culture plates, transfection was performed using fugene hd reagent , containing 60 μg of dna and 180 μl of the reagent per  <dig> millions of cells in 30 ml of the above medium. plasmids p <dig>  were transfected by electroporation in gene pulser electroporation buffer  using a cuvette with a 4 mm gap with  <dig>  million cells and 15 μg of linearized dna for each transfection. cells were counted by trypan blue exclusion and fluorescence microscopy at 48 h post-transfection. for direct generation of colonies, transiently transfected cell cultures were transferred into cho-a culture medium  lacking hypoxanthine and thymidine , and seeded at  <dig> cells/well in the culture plates. cells were grown undisturbed for 14 days and inspected by fluorescence microscopy. the medium was changed and the plates were cultivated for 5– <dig> additional days until the first 10% of the wells containing colonies became confluent.

to generate stably transfected cell populations using p <dig> egfp and p <dig> egfp plasmids, transiently transfected cultures were transferred to opticho medium  lacking ht, and thereafter cultivated in shaking flasks with medium exchange every 3 days until the cell viability increased to 85% .

mtx-driven target gene amplification in culture plates was performed by seeding the cells from stably transfected cell populations into 96-well culture plates at a density of  <dig> cells/well in the cho-a culture medium, supplemented with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> nm mtx. three plates were used for each concentration of mtx. the cells were grown undisturbed for 14 days, after which the plates were inspected by microscopy and the culture medium was changed every 4 days until the first 10% of wells in each plate became confluent. plates were screened again by fluorescence microscopy, and cells from the  <dig> brightest wells from each plate were transferred into a 48-well plate, grown to confluence, and then transferred into 24-well plates. colonies lacking normal proliferation speeds or attached to the surface of the plates too tightly for dislodging by pipetting were discarded. cells from the eight brightest wells for each mtx concentration were dislodged from their plates, lysed as described below, and then used to determine egfp levels. six randomly picked colonies, obtained in the presence of  <dig> and  <dig> nm mtx, were transferred into a 6-well plate and grown with shaking in opticho medium with passages made every three days for 60 days. samples for egfp level determination were collected every second passage.

target gene amplification for polyclonal cell populations was performed for the suspension culture of cho dg <dig> cells, stably transfected by the p <dig> egfp plasmid in presence of  <dig> nm mtx, as described above. concentration of the mtx in the culture medium was increased by two-fold steps, each after two consecutive passages, until the cell viability decreased below 85%. resulting culture, obtained in presence of  <dig>  μm mtx, was split into four flasks, supplemented by  <dig> ;  <dig> ;  <dig> ;  <dig>  μm mtx and cultured until the cell viability returned to at least 85% .generation of polyclonal cell populations involving transfected p <dig>  plasmids were performed by seeding transiently transfected cells in 6-well culture plates, using  <dig> million of viable cells per well in 5 ml of dg <dig> medium, supplemented with the corresponding antibiotic, or 5 ml of opticho medium with  <dig> nm mtx for control transfections using p <dig>  plasmids. the concentrations of the antibiotics used are shown in figure  <dig>  plates were cultivated with shaking until the cell viability returned to at least 85% , after which the medium was changed every 4 days.

determination of egfp concentrations in cell lysates
cell culture samples containing approximately one million of cells were centrifuged and the cell pellets were resuspended in phosphate buffered saline and recentrifuged. the washed cell pellets were resuspended in  <dig>  ml of lysis solution containing 150 mm nacl, 50 mm tris–hcl at ph  <dig> , 1% triton x- <dig>  a protease inhibitor cocktail , and then incubated for 30 min on ice with stirring. cell debris was removed by centrifugation. the concentration of egfp in the lysate from the h- <dig> cell population  was measured by spectrophotometry at a wavelength of 488 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of  <dig>  m−1 · cm− <dig> and an egfp molecular weight of  <dig>  kda  <cit> . the fluorescence intensity of egfp in all of the lysates was measured along with the serially diluted calibration samples, which were prepared from the h- <dig> lysate containing a known concentration of egfp. total protein concentration in the lysates was measured by the bradford method with bovine serum albumin as a standard.

facs analysis and quantitative pcr
undiluted cell culture samples were subject to facs fc  <dig>  analysis at an emission at 488 nm and detection through a 530/40-nm bandpass filter. at least  <dig>  individual cells were counted for each sample analysed. quantitative pcr analysis of the expression plasmid copy numbers in the genomes of stably transfected cells was performed using an icycler iq thermocycler  and qpcrmix-hs sybr  reaction mixture with the primers shown in additional file 1: table s <dig>  the highly purified p <dig> egfp plasmid was used as a quantity calibrator using five different concentrations for each determination performed in triplicate. pcr was performed three times with three to four replicates for each sample. genomic dna was extracted from cells with a genomic dna purification kit  and quantified using a qubit fluorometer  and the dsdna hs kit . quantity calibrator plasmid was used as the external standard for the quantification of genomic dna samples by fluorometry.

RESULTS
construction of expression plasmids
since the transfection efficiency and, probably, the genome integration rate of an expression plasmid is inversely proportional to its size  <cit> , we made a minimal backbone plasmid by eliminating most of the unnecessary elements from the puc <dig> plasmid. the resulting plasmid, pbl- <dig>  lacks the f <dig> origin of replication, and the bacterial promoter of the lacz gene along with the lacz orf itself and some flanking dna regions. overall, the resulting plasmid length decreased some 600 bp from  <dig> to 2032 bp.

the upstream and downstream regions of the eef1a gene were obtained from cho dg <dig> cell genomic dna using the modular assembly cloning technique described previously  <cit> . a concatemer of terminal repeats from the epstein-barr virus   <cit>  was assembled from synthetic oligonucleotides using the same technique and was inserted along with the ires from the encephalomyocarditis virus and the murine dhfr open reading frame into the pbl- <dig> vector. cloning the upstream and downstream flanking areas of the eef1a gene into the pbl-2-id-ebv plasmid resulted in the expression vector p <dig>  . a control vector, lacking the ebvtr fragment, was assembled similarly and is denoted here as p <dig> . the p <dig>  plasmid was approximately  <dig>  kbp shorter than the original eef1a-based plasmid, pdef <dig>  despite addition of the ebvtr fragment. the egfp orf with the synthetic consensus kozak sequence  <cit>  was cloned into both vectors and the resulting plasmids p <dig> egfp and p <dig> egfp were used for cho cell transfections.

generation of stably transfected colonies using p <dig> -based plasmids
transient transfection of the dhfr-deficient cho dg <dig> cells resulted in significantly decreased transfection efficiencies for both of the eef1a-based plasmids relative to the cytomegalovirus - promoter-based 4700 bp pegfp-n <dig> plasmid, and approximately the same transfection efficiencies and egfp expression levels for plasmids with or without the ebvtr element .

at the same time, stable integration rate  of the p <dig> egfp plasmid was  <dig> times higher than that of the p <dig> egfp control plasmid in the selection medium lacking both ht and mtx , clearly indicating that the ebvtr element was active in the very large expression plasmid. transfection and selection of stably transformed cho dg <dig> cells by the p <dig> egfp plasmid was repeated with the selection medium supplemented with  <dig> nm mtx. in this case, the egfp expression level increased twice for the ten most productive wells . thus, the p <dig>  plasmid is suitable for creation of stably transfected cell clones or populations under variable selection stringencies.

mtx-driven target gene amplification
since the ebvtr element was effective at increasing the incidence of stable transfection, we tested its ability to speed up the transgene amplification process. polyclonal populations of cho dg <dig> cells, transfected by p <dig> egfp and p <dig> egfp plasmids and selected for stable integration by suspension cultivation in the absence of mtx and ht, were seeded in the 96-well culture plates in the presence of 0– <dig> nm mtx and grown undisturbed until visible colonies developed. for the p <dig> egfp plasmid lacking the ebvtr element, no viable cell colonies were obtained in the presence of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> nm mtx. the egfp expression levels of the highest expressing colonies, obtained in the presence of  <dig> and  <dig> nm mtx, was in the same range as the colonies obtained by direct plating of transiently transfected cells in the absence of mtx . in the case of the p <dig> -egfp plasmid, multiple colonies were obtained for all of the concentrations of mtx tested. after visual screening by fluorescence microscopy and expansion, the eight brightest colonies for each concentration of mtx employed were grown to confluency in 24-well culture plates. the relative egfp expression levels for these colonies  was approximately  <dig> times higher when cultivated with  <dig> nm mtx, and approximately  <dig> times higher when cultivated with  <dig> nm mtx, compared with cultivation without mtx. six randomly chosen colonies, obtained in the presence of  <dig> and  <dig> nm mtx, were scaled up, re-adapted to suspension culture and cultivated for 60 days. no substantial decay in the egfp expression level was detected for each colony . thus, the p <dig>  vector is suitable for target gene amplification in the presence of mtx. the resulting cell clones are sufficiently stable for cell bank generation and subsequent large-scale cultivation.target gene amplification process was also tested for polyclonal cell population, obtained by the primary selection in the presence of  <dig> nm mtx. sequential addition of mtx from  <dig> nm to  <dig> nm gave no decrease in cell viability, egfp level was also constant . further addition of  <dig>  –  <dig>  μm of mtx, performed in one step for multiple culture flasks, resulted in the concentration-dependent increase of egfp content , peaking at 9% of the total protein in the case of  <dig>  μm of mtx. analysis of the copy numbers of the integrated plasmids using quantitative pcr  showed that higher mtx level and higher egfp content correspond to higher copy number of the integrated plasmid. hereby, the vector p <dig>  is suitable for obtaining highly productive cell populations or clones by direct clone selection in culture plates in the presence of mtx or by the multi-step target gene amplification in the suspension culture.

polyclonal cell populations stably transfected by p <dig>  plasmids
heterologous expression of a functionally active target protein often requires co-expression of a small number of protein processing enzymes. for example, the blood clotting factor ix expression systems used with cho or bhk cells rely on co-expression of the signal protease pace/furin  <cit>  and the vitamin-k recharging enzyme, vkorc <dig>  <cit> . generally, the expression levels of such “helper” proteins should be lower than that of the target protein, but of comparable magnitude. if the target protein is coded by a plasmid bearing a dhfr selection marker, helper proteins may be coded by plasmids with the same structure, but bearing antibiotic resistance markers. we have tested resistance markers for three widely used antibiotics, g <dig> , zeocin, and hygromycin, in the eef1a-based expression vector, which was modified by removing the ires fragment and the dhfr open reading frame from the p <dig>  plasmid, and insertion of the corresponding antibiotic resistance genes outside of the eef1a gene flanking areas and controlled by a separate sv <dig> promoter. the resulting vectors, denoted p <dig> -neo, p <dig> -zeo, and p <dig> -hygro, were used for insertion of the egfp protein orf. all three resulting plasmids showed similar transient transfection efficiencies in cho dg <dig> cells , and the resulting cell populations were used to generate stably transfected cell populations in the suspension culture under variable selection pressures for each antibiotic used. the control plasmids p <dig> egfp and p <dig> egfp were transfected using the same procedure and stably transfected cell populations were generated by suspension cultivation in the presence of  <dig> nm mtx. the populations obtained were examined to determine the proportion of egfp-expressing cells and egfp levels in cell lysates . we found that for all three selection markers at all levels of drug selection pressure the resulting cell populations contained more than 75% of egfp-positive cells. for the hygromycin and mtx resistance markers, less than 5% of the cells were egfp-negative. the level of egfp in the cell lysates was maximal for hygromycin selection, peaking as  <dig> % of the total cellular protein with  <dig>  mg/ml of hygromycin. in contrast, egfp levels in the polyclonal cell populations obtained from transfection with p <dig> egfp or p <dig> egfp were much lower at  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively; however, egfp expression levels for the p <dig>  vector could potentially increase by eight-fold using the mtx-driven target gene amplification described above.we also measured the intracellular egfp distribution in polyclonal cell populations using facs . virtually no cells were egfp-negative with dhfr and hygromycin selection markers, whereas with the neomycin resistance gene the level of egfp-negative cells was inversely proportional to the concentration of g <dig> used. the mean egfp level for the upper 10% of the egfp-positive cells was not dependent on the antibiotic concentration for neomycin and zeocin selection, whereas with hygromycin selection the mean egfp level was higher at higher antibiotic concentrations.

analysis of the copy numbers of the genome-integrated plasmids using quantitative pcr revealed that the p <dig> -hyg-egfp plasmid generated the maximum number of inserts, correlating with the highest expression level of egfp. while the p <dig> -zeo-egfp plasmid exhibited higher egfp expression levels than p <dig> -neo-egfp, it was present at half the copy number. in the case of plasmids containing the dhfr selection marker, the presence of the ebvtr element resulted in higher egfp expression levels at lower numbers of genome inserts; this probably indicates that ebvtr drives integration events in areas of the genome that are transcriptionally active.

CONCLUSIONS
creation of mammalian cell lines that express high levels of recombinant protein and maintain stable production levels over several months of cultivation is still a very time-consuming and labour-intensive process. introduction of eef1a-based vectors superseding cmv-based types has enabled smaller numbers of cell clones to be screened and evaluated by increasing the mean level of target protein expression. we have modified existing eef1a-based vectors by linking the dhfr selection marker and target gene in the bicistronic rna, shortening the overall plasmid size, and adding an ebvtr element. the presence of an ebvtr element in the resulting p <dig>  vector increased the stable transfection rate by a factor of  <dig>  and increased the target protein expression level by eight-fold using a single round of mtx-driven target gene amplification. two consecutive rounds of mtx-driven amplification, performed for suspension culture, resulted in the polyclonal cell population with the egfp expression level comprising  <dig> % of the total cytoplasmic protein. compatible vectors bearing antibiotic resistance markers instead of the dhfr gene were created and found to be approximately equal to the dhfr-based vector for generation of highly productive cell populations. we found that the eef1a-based vector, p <dig> -hygro, containing the hygromycin selection marker, allowed direct generation of a polyclonal cell population that was nearly devoid of egfp-negative cells, while egfp expression comprised up to  <dig> % of the total cytoplasmic protein. this level of egfp expression corresponds to only  <dig> copies of the target gene per single haploid genome, in contrast to cmv-based vectors that have thousands of copies per genome in highly productive lines  <cit> . the set of vectors developed herein allows generation of highly productive and stable cell clones with limited effort and such vectors may be employed to create cell lines for production of biosimilar pharmaceuticals. p <dig>  or p <dig> -based plasmids, stably transfected into polyclonal cell populations expressing large quantities of target proteins at a scale of 4–6* <dig> cells, can be generated in less than one month by simple periodic passage of a culture from a shaking flask. this technique may be useful for obtaining milligram quantities of mutants of a protein of interest or for evaluation of several mab clones. cells from these polyclonal populations may be also used for direct development of industrially applicable clonal cell lines by limiting dilution.
