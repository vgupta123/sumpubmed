BACKGROUND
nitrogen  and light  are two important signals that regulate plant growth and development. microarray studies have been used to investigate the genome-wide effects of regulatory interactions of signals like n, carbon  and l, as follows: c and n signaling  <cit> , c and l signaling  <cit> , c and circadian rhythm  <cit> . more recently, a study explored genome-wide effects of all combinations of c, l, n interactions in two different organs  <cit> . however, very little is known of the regulatory networks involved in the perception and transduction of n and l signals and their cross-talk  <cit> . a mechanism by which n and l signals exert their effects on plants is through their ability to affect the expression of a large number of genes. in fact, a number of transcription factors associated with changes in gene expression by n and l have been identified; interestingly, atbzip <dig> has been hypothesized to be one of them  <cit> .

the basic-region leucine zipper  transcription factor family is represented by multiple genes, encoding proteins that contain a basic region involved in dna binding and nuclear import, and a leucine zipper dimerization domain  <cit> . it is becoming clear that plant bzip factors are regulated by post-translational mechanisms affecting their dna binding and transcriptional properties, their stability, and their capacity to form homodimers and heterodimers, and to interact with non-bzip proteins  <cit> . these mechanisms enable a rapid and often reversible adaptation of bzip activities in response to endogenous and environmental cues  <cit> . the arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes approximately  <dig> predicted bzip factors  <cit> . like other transcription factor genes in plants, members of the bzip transcription factor family are expressed in an organ-specific manner  <cit> , and have been shown to regulate diverse biological processes such as stimulus-response  <cit> , cell cycle specificity  <cit> , control seed storage and maturation  <cit> , pathogen defense and flower development  <cit> . it has also been recently shown that the activity of several bzip transcription factors  is partially mediated by kin <dig>  a kinase that is a central integrator of a transcription network involved in plant stress response and energy signaling  <cit> . most recently, kang et al.  <cit>  studied the role of atbzip <dig> in sugar-mediated gene expression using a reverse genetic analyses. their results indicate that atbzip <dig> acts as a negative regulator of early seedling growth in the absence of exogenous sugars in the culture medium, implicating a role of atbzip <dig> in sugar-mediated gene expression.

to identify the potential role of bzip <dig> as an integrator of n and l signaling, this study identifies and characterizes the molecular defects of a bzip <dig> t-dna mutant on a genome-wide scale in the context of combinatorial treatments of n and l. several models describing the role of bzip <dig> in the genome-wide integration of these signals are derived from this analysis.

RESULTS
several previous studies, including one from our laboratory, indicate that the bzip <dig> transcription factor is regulated in response to nitrogen  and light  treatments  <cit> . to further study the role of bzip <dig> in mediating the integration of n and l signaling, we studied the effect of a bzip <dig> mutation in contrasted nutritional conditions of n and l combinatorial treatments. to interpret the results, we developed an analysis involving reverse genetics and statistical modeling of transcriptome data generated from different treatments that systematically vary nitrogen and light as input signals , as described below.

characterization of bzip <dig> regulation and isolation of t-dna knock-out mutants
we tested conditions of pre-treatment and treatment that optimized bzip <dig> regulation in response to nitrogen and light treatments. following this protocol, 14-day-old arabidopsis seedlings grown in low n conditions , were treated with nitrogen concentrations found in standard ms media  for  <dig> hrs in either light- or dark-adapted growth conditions . the 1xn treatment consists of the same n source found in standard ms salts, which is the established standard amount of n for plant growth  <cit> , and was successfully used before to identified inorganic and organic n responses in arabidopsis  <cit> . thus, plants were subject to four different nitrogen and/or light treatments ; +n-l; -n+l; +n+l). quantification of bzip <dig> mrna in wild-type columbia ecotype  plants, confirmed that bzip <dig> mrna is induced by n-treatment and repressed by l-treatment as described below . in wild-type col- <dig> plants, n-treatment led to an equal induction of bzip <dig> mrna in either absence or presence of light: +n-l/-n-l =  <dig>  fold; +n+l/-n+l =  <dig>  fold . similarly, l-treatment led to an equal repression of bzip <dig> in either the absence or presence of n; -n-l/-n+l =  <dig>  fold; +n-l/+n+l =  <dig>  fold . this result demonstrates that bzip <dig> mrna levels are controlled by n or l signaling, but that these signals do not interact in the control of bzip <dig> mrna accumulation . in other words, n and l act independently to control bzip <dig> mrna accumulation.

in order to investigate the role of bzip <dig> in the control of gene expression in response to n and l treatments, we obtained a t-dna mutant knock-out arabidopsis line  , which contains a t-dna insertion in its single exon . we characterized bzip <dig> mutant lines for homozygous for the t-dna insert. we also characterized a wt sibling  derived from a backcross of a heterozygous line for the bzip <dig> t-dna mutation, as identified by pcr analysis on genomic dna . quantification of bzip <dig> mrna levels by rt-pcr, revealed that transcripts of bzip <dig> are undetectable in the homozygous bzip1- <dig> t-dna mutant in either shoots or roots . to insure that the changes in global gene regulation were due to the deletion in the bzip <dig> gene, we compared the expression values of bzip <dig> mrna in the bzip1- <dig> t-dna mutant to a wt sibling, as described below.

genomic microarray analysis of wild-type and bzip1- <dig> t-dna mutant seedlings
the bzip1- <dig> t-dna mutant and wt-sib plants were subjected to the systematic combination of n and l conditions described above  in three independent experiments . rna obtained from these samples was subjected to transcriptomic analysis using arabidopsis ath <dig> affymetrix chips . three-way anova  was used to detect genes for which genotype factor has an effect on its own, or in combination with either l, n or both . this approach detected  <dig>  l-regulated genes;  <dig> n-regulated genes;  <dig> g-regulated genes;  <dig> l*n-regulated genes;  <dig> n*g-regulated genes,  <dig> l*g-regulated genes;  <dig> n*l*g-regulated genes . the union of these four gene lists having g  as an influential factor corresponds to  <dig> distinct genes  whose regulation is affected by the bzip1- <dig> mutation . this analysis shows that a bzip <dig> mutation affects n and l regulation to the same extent, based on the number of mis-regulated genes .

the bzip1- <dig> mutation triggers different modes of mis-regulation
with the aim of gaining further insight into the role of bzip <dig> in the regulation of gene expression in response to n and l, we clustered the expression of the  <dig> genes whose response to n and/or l is misregulated in the bzip1- <dig> mutant, compared to its wt sibling . this analysis generated  <dig> gene clusters ranging between  <dig> and  <dig> genes per cluster . the analysis of these gene clusters indicates that the bzip1- <dig> mutation triggers at least four different classes of gene expression deregulation as follows:

in the first class misregulated genes, in four cases  the bzip1- <dig> mutation attenuates signal regulation. all of these clusters have in common an attenuation of l signaling by the bzip <dig> mutation. this demonstrates that bzip <dig> is directly or indirectly involved in sustaining gene expression modulation by light, as confirmed by previous studies  <cit> .

unexpected, all clusters in the second class of genes  share the property that the bzip1- <dig> mutation triggers a regulation of gene expression by the n or l signals that is inverse to the wt-sib response. for instance, the  <dig> regulated genes in cluster # <dig> are induced by n in the wt-sib, while in the bzip1- <dig> mutant, they are repressed by n treatment. this observation leads to the tentative hypothesis that bzip <dig> is involved in a yet-to-be-defined "switching" system involved in modifying gene response to nutritional cues, perhaps depending on environmental conditions or developmental stages.

this analysis also shows that a third class of genes  encompasses genes for which the bzip1- <dig> mutation triggers a new or hidden regulation. one striking example of this is cluster # <dig>  for which genes are not regulated by n and l in wt-sib. however, when bzip <dig> is mutated, the overall expression level of all genes in the cluster is increased, and all  <dig> genes are now regulated  in the absence of n and/or l. cluster # <dig> is another striking example of this type of regulation. in wt-sib plants, the  <dig> genes in cluster # <dig> are modestly induced by +n/-l, however in bzip1- <dig> mutant plants, those  <dig> genes tend to be strongly and consistently induced by n . these observations highlight the point that bzip <dig> might be involved in bypassing gene regulation  needed in other circumstances, such as a different hydro-mineral environment, or at a different developmental stage.

the fourth class of genes  show a complex de-regulation in response to n and/or l treatment. we hypothesize that these clusters might represent the composite effects of the three cases illustrated above. for example, cluster # <dig> contains genes clearly repressed by n in the dark  in wt-sib, and induced by n in the dark in the bzip1- <dig> mutant. this partial reversion of the n effect  could correspond to the phenomenon described above.

to determine the biological significance of these gene clusters, we searched for the overrepresentation of mips functional terms among the genes on these clusters using the biomaps tool from virtualplant  <cit> . this analysis did not uncover any significant terms. one very likely explanation for this negative result is that the number of genes in each cluster is too limited . as such, it is very unlikely to get any significant over-representation of terms in such small gene lists.

on a cluster-by-cluster basis, we developed conceptual boolean models for illustrating the multiplicity of the roles of bzip <dig> in the control of gene expression by l and/or n, based on the anova output generated for each cluster .

a striking result arises from the analysis of these boolean models as a whole. indeed, the underlying signaling mechanisms involving bzip <dig> tend to use the same modality of expression. for example, when comparing clusters # <dig> vs. # <dig>  it seems to be the exact same mode of regulation with opposite influences of the signal  and of the bzip <dig> mutation. this observation is also valid for more complex behaviors such as for clusters # <dig> vs. # <dig> 

taken together, these results demonstrate that bzip <dig> is involved in fine-tuning gene expression in response to combined n and l signals. the role of bzip <dig> can be divided into several modes of regulation, including the bypassing of n and l signals that can only be revealed when bzip <dig> is absent.

discussion
identification of bzip <dig> regulatory network
members of the bzip transcription factor family are involved in the regulation of diverse biological processes such as plant growth, development, and environmental responses  <cit> . several studies have reported that the transcript levels for the bzip <dig> transcription factor are induced by dark treatments  <cit> . by over-expressing the bzip <dig> protein in a protoplast system, it was shown that bzip <dig> and other bzip transcription factors act synergistically with the kinase  in the control of dark-induced genes, including asn1/din <dig>  involved in asparagine synthesis  <cit> . in another study related to n-sensing, bzip <dig> mrna was also shown to be induced by n-treatment and, based on network analysis, it was predicted to control the n-induction of a set of predicted downstream target genes including asn <dig>  <cit> . herein, we assessed the complexity of the underlying regulatory networks controlled by bzip <dig>  by studying the effect of the bzip <dig> mutation in altering the l and/or n regulation of genes at a genome-wide level. to this aim, we used a t-dna insertion line in the unique exon of the bzip <dig> gene, and compared its expression pattern to a wild-type sibling with no t-dna insert in bzip <dig> gene . it is important to clarify that in this work we compared t-dna insert and wt siblings in order to subtract the effects of potential t-dna insertions. in order to rule out the possibility of the effect of a genetically linked insertion that could not be accounted by the wt siblings, we looked at the expression of the neighbour genes of bzip <dig>  first, the genes framing bzip <dig>  are normally expressed  and not affected by the t-dna insertion. second, since bzip <dig> is in the 5th chromosome, we evaluated how the mutation might have affected gene expression on this chromosome. we compared the expression of the genes in wt-sib vs. bzip1- <dig> mutant over the 5th chromosome. except for bzip <dig> itself, which of course record a  <dig> fold repression of the bzip <dig> transcript, we did not recorded any change in gene expression higher than a  <dig> fold down regulation in the bzip <dig> mutant for a gene being on the 5th chromosome. moreover, this down regulation concerns a gene that is reported as not expressed according to the affymetrix mas <dig> calls and is ~ <dig> genes away from bzip <dig>  so we believe that the effect recorded for the bzip <dig> mutation is very unlikely explainable by an extra t-dna insertion that could be genetically linked to the actual insertion in bzip <dig> genes.

the anova analysis of these experiments uncovered a set of  <dig> genes whose regulation by n and/or l was altered in the bzip1- <dig> mutant, compared to a wild-type sibling, the results of which are discussed below. interestingly, we were not able to detect mis-regulation of asn <dig> gene expression in this transcriptome data set, even though asn <dig> had previously been shown to be a target of bzip <dig> in gain of function experiments related to dark regulation  <cit> , and it had also been predicted to play a role in n-regulation  <cit> . this is likely due to the potential functional redundancy of the bzip transcription factors, as cited by baena-gonzalez et al.  <cit> , whose analysis shows that there is a redundancy with other bzip genes in the control of asn1/din <dig> 

another line of evidence supporting the complex role of bzip <dig> in integrating n and l signals is the comparative transcriptome behavior of gene clusters in bzip1- <dig> mutant vs. a wt-sibling. indeed, these results demonstrate that the bzip <dig> mutation triggers a genome-wide deregulation in response to n and/or l signals that range from i) a lowering of the l signal effect, to ii) unlocking gene regulation in response to n and l combinations . this provides evidence that the regulatory networks involved in the co-control of gene expression by n and l is highly complex and might involve several layers of regulations including functional redundancy. however, it is noteworthy that we were not able to find any positive evidence for transcriptional compensation by other bzip genes .

recently, the same bzip <dig> t-dna mutant   <cit>  was used to study effects of bzip <dig> in carbon signaling by comparing the bzip <dig> mutant and wt plants in a microarray analysis. in that study, rna gel blot analysis confirmed that the salk_ <dig> line was indeed a bzip1-ko. as a result of that study, researchers found two sets of putative bzip1-regulated genes. among them, sugar-responsive genes are highly over-represented, implicating a role of bzip <dig> in sugar-mediated gene expression. that work supports our present results indicating that a knock-out of the bzip <dig> transcription factor is enough to drive dramatic changes in gene expression in a direct and/or indirect way.

a new insight into the regulatory network complexity: hidden/locked regulatory mechanisms?
the role of transcription factors in integrating plant responses to nutritional cues is of great interest in order to shape and improve plant development in response to environmental nutrition. however, while several studies have studied genome-wide responses of mutants in response to a single nutrient treatment such a nitrate  <cit> , to our knowledge only one  <cit>  has reported the changes in gene regulation triggered by a mutation  in response to combinatorial treatments of signals  and light . in the present study, we have used a similar complete set of combinatorial treatments of l and n on the bzip1- <dig> mutant, to explore the role of bzip <dig> in the interaction and propagation of these signals. our combination of statistical analysis , clustering and boolean modeling of the signals, allowed us to propose that a mutation in bzip <dig> triggers different modes of de-regulation in response to n and/or l signaling. previous work had already shown that transcription factors can be at the same time inducers and repressors, and our results on bzip <dig> supported this hypothesis. however, we believe that our study went a step further. indeed, the surprising results are that a mutation in bzip <dig> can: i) invert the regulation of certain clusters/genes in response to nutritional signals , and ii) lead to the regulation of genes by n and/or l, which are not normally regulated in the wt context. despite our extensive effort to find such events in the literature, we did not find any similar mechanism demonstrated at a genome-wide scale. this may be due to the fact that studies involving modeling in combined experimental treatment conditions  of wild-type and mutants are relatively rare. interestingly, discovering the underlying mechanisms by which the mutation of a transcription factor leads to unlock and/or reverse regulation of genes by signals could have potential applications in biotechnology, since the use of mutants could potentially avoid the use of transgenesis in order to drive the regulation of target genes of interests in crop plants.

finally, in order to assign biological functional categories significantly regulated to the gene lists under the control of the different signals nitrogen , light , genotype  and their interaction, we used the biomap tool provided thought the virtual plant platform  <cit>  . surprisingly, we found several functional categories regulated as a group by n, but none of the category such as nitrate assimilation. this was an intriguing result. however, with the antecedents of the mis-regulations found by previous studies, we hypothesized that this could be due to the fact that some genes tend to be n regulated in the bzip <dig> mutant, and not in wt. thus, because genes regulated by n are detected as such by anova over the wt and bzip <dig> mutant data, we decided to analyze the same data but only on wt . interestingly, nitrate assimilation and nitrate metabolic process are found to be functional categories over-represented in the n regulated genes in wt. this means that the functional categories found to be regulated by n in the whole dataset, are largely due to the contribution of both the wt and the bzip <dig> n regulated genes . further, it is noteworthy that genes under the control of bzip <dig>  as a factor  or in combination with n or l, did not share any significant functional categories. despite the fact that this is a negative result, it can be explained by the fact that bzip <dig> triggered very diverse mis-regulations as it was demonstrated in the boolean modeling process.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, we have taken a reverse genetic approach combined with a statistical modeling of the transcriptome, to study the role of bzip <dig> in mediating the integration of n and l signaling. we were able to show not only that bzip <dig> mutation affect n and l regulation, but also that this regulation can have different patterns/modes of regulation. we believe that in addition to elucidating the role of bzip <dig> mutation in the whole plant, we present a valuable pipeline of analysis that can help to define the role of different genes in a system view.
