BACKGROUND
plants are exposed to a diverse array of pathogens and pests and their survival depends on different mechanisms for self-defense. such defenses include physical cell wall barriers 
 <cit> , as well as the production of a diverse range of molecules which can inhibit the growth of microbial pathogens 
 <cit> . among the latter, cationic antimicrobial peptides such as defensins, are a most relevant and large family of defense compounds 
 <cit> .

plant defensins are characterized as small globular, basic, cysteine-rich proteins , containing a triple-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and one α-helix that are stabilized into a compact shape by four disulfide bridges 
 <cit> . these bridges form a cysteine-stabilized α-helix β-sheet motif  that is well conserved in peptides with antimicrobial activity. two additional structural motifs have been described in the plant defensin structure, namely the α-core, encompassing the loop connecting the first β-strand and the α-helix, and the γ-core containing the hairpin loop connecting β-strands  <dig> and  <dig>  
 <cit> . despite the tertiary structure being strongly conserved in plant defensins, the similarity on the primary sequence level is limited to eight cysteine residues, two glycines, one aromatic residue and a glutamic acid in the defined positions 
 <cit> . variations in the amino acid sequences are reflected by small changes in the spatial display of the loops that contribute to the wide range of biological activities observed in these peptides, as a single amino acid substitution can change the spectrum of activity.

unlike the insect and mammalian defensins, which are mainly active against bacteria 
 <cit> , plant defensins, with a few exceptions, do not exhibit antibacterial activity 
 <cit> . they inhibit the growth of a broad spectrum of fungal plant pathogens, such as fusarium oxysporum, verticillium dahliae and botrytis cinerea, but also of saccharomyces cerevisiae and human pathogenic fungi such as candida albicans at very low concentrations in vitro <cit> . the precise mode of action of plant defensins is still unclear, and for most plant defensins the molecular components involved in signaling and putative intracellular targets remain unknown 
 <cit> . only for the defensin rs-afp <dig> from raphanus sativus and the defensin dm-amp <dig> from dahlia merckii, a putative target in the fungal membrane has been identified 
 <cit> . more recently, it was demonstrated that plant defensins can be internalized into the cytoplasm and interact with specific intracellular targets 
 <cit> . moreover, some members of the plant defensins family were found to have additional activities in vitro. these include the inhibition of α-amylase 
 <cit> , protein translation 
 <cit>  and proteases 
 <cit> , as well as zinc tolerance mediators in plant 
 <cit> , ion channel blockers 
 <cit> , enzymatic activity involved in ascorbic acid redox state 
 <cit>  and activity towards mammalian cells 
 <cit> .

plant defensins and their antimicrobial effects have been reported from many angiosperm plants, including monocots and dicots. the genome of arabidopsis thaliana contains  <dig> different defensin genes that respond to various stresses 
 <cit> . however, polypeptides with similar properties have not been well studied in gymnosperms. the availability of a substantial expressed sequence tag  resource developed for picea glauca <cit>  has resulted in the identification of only one expressed defensin gene, pgd <dig> <cit> , and one antifungal protein 
 <cit> . this prompted us to perform a wide bioinformatics analysis to screen for novel spruce defensins.

here, we describe the identification of new picea defensin genes, and the characterization of one of the defensin peptides, pgd <dig>  the identification of new defensins from p. glauca expands our knowledge on conifer genomics and raises interest to study the potential of spruce defensins as fungicidal agents.

RESULTS
defensin-like peptides in picea glauca genome
the p. glauca est database was first screened with the amino acid sequence of picea glauca defensin  <dig>  by the tblastn program. tblastn is especially suitable for the discovery of distant homologues with a conserved sequence motif 
 <cit> . this initial screening yielded four different est hits, gq03918_c <dig>  gq02811_i <dig>  gq03707_g <dig> and gq01307_a <dig>  which shared similarity to pgd <dig>  the complete coding sequences of the isolated ests were then named p. glauca defensin  <dig> to  <dig> , respectively. when the deduced coding sequences of the new pgds were compared to pgd <dig>  high similarity was observed for pgd2- <dig> with 83-86% sequence identity . in contrast, only 60% identity was observed when pgd <dig> was compared with pgd <dig> 

alignment analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences of pgd2- <dig> revealed that pgd <dig> codes for a precursor of  <dig> amino acid with the highest similarity to defensin  <dig> from pinus sylvestris  at the 93% similarity level . pgd <dig> and pgd <dig> code for  <dig> amino acid peptides sharing 100% and 99% identities with an unknown protein from picea sitchensis , respectively . the deduced amino acid sequences of pgd <dig> and pgd <dig> were identical, except for a substitution of ser for gly in position  <dig>  . pgd <dig> codes for a precursor of 77-amino acids. alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence revealed that the mature region of pgd <dig> shares high similarity with members of the gymnosperms, displaying 64% homology to both the scots pine defensin  <dig>  
 <cit>  and the defensin  <dig> from picea glauca  
 <cit> , respectively, as well as to unrelated plant defensins from different families . for instance, it displays 62% similarity to defensin vv-amp <dig> from vitis vinifera <cit>  and 62% similarity to putative defensin  <dig> from olea europaea <cit> . pgd <dig> shares  <dig> conserved amino acids, including eight cysteine and two glycine residues, as well as one glutamic acid and one aromatic residue at conserved positions. these amino acids are common to all plant defensins 
 <cit> . disulphide-bridge analysis done with dipro confirmed that the eight cysteine residues of pgd <dig> are connected by four disulfide bridges .

when the p. glauca est database was further screened with the amino acid sequences of several other gymnosperm defensins, no additional new defensins were identified. surprisingly, screening of the p. glauca est database with the amino acid sequence of plectasin  
 <cit>  yielded one est hit, gq <dig> b7_k <dig>  which shared 58% similarity to plectasin . the complete coding sequence of est gq <dig> b7_k <dig> was  <dig> bp in size and codes for a predicted 90-amino acid peptide. signalp results showed that the first  <dig> amino acids code for a signal peptide followed by a 30-amino acid pro-peptide and a mature peptide of  <dig> amino acids . comparative analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of mature peptide with other members of the defensin family revealed that the peptide shares a disulphide bridge pattern common to defensins of fungi, insects and other invertebrates 
 <cit> . it contains three disulphide bridges in contrast to all plant defensins that typically have four disulphide bridges .

the most distantly related pgd <dig> and the gene encoded within est gq <dig> b7_k <dig> were selected for further analysis. in both cases, the cdna library containing the corresponding genes was exclusively isolated from actively elongating roots tips free of mycorrhiza.

genomic and in silico characterization of pgd <dig> and endopiceasin
primers were designed based on the est gq01307_a <dig> sequence and pcr was carried out to amplify the complete coding sequence of pgd <dig> using genomic dna of p. glauca. genomic amplification of the sample resulted in a product of about  <dig> bp and a comparative analysis with the est gq01307_a <dig> revealed that a  <dig> bp-intron interrupts the predicted signal peptide . signalp analysis showed that the first  <dig> amino acids code for a signal peptide followed by a 50-amino acid mature peptide . pa-sub predicted that the signal peptide of pgd <dig> directs its product to the extracellular space of plant cells. the peptide parameters obtained from the expasy-compute pi/mw tool showed that pgd <dig> has a predicted mono-isotopic mass of  <dig>  da and is highly basic with a net charge of + <dig> and an isoelectric point above  <dig> . seven different spruce species, namely p. glauca and p. mariana , p. smithiana, p. wilsonii and p. orientalis , and p. abies and p. omorika  were selected to isolate the corresponding putative defensins from genomic dna. pcr reactions resulted in amplification of seven genomic copies of pgd <dig>  which were sequenced. alignment analysis of these genomic sequences revealed a very high level of similarity  between the sequences at nucleotide level where the majority of mismatches occurred in the intron region . the sequences at the deduced amino acid level were 100% identical, indicating that the peptide is fully conserved within the genus picea.

in the case of endopiceasin, primers were designed based on the est gq <dig> b7_k <dig> sequence and pcr was carried out to amplify the complete coding sequence of the mature peptide using genomic dna of p. glauca. genomic amplification was unsuccessful as no product was obtained. these results suggest that the defensin is not encoded by the plant genome itself and we suggest to designate this defensin as endopiceasin.

comparative modeling of the deduced amino acid sequence suggested that the tertiary structure of pgd <dig> closely resembles that of nad <dig>  a floral defensin from nicotiana tabacum . these defensins contain an invariant tetradisulfide array and have the common cysteine-stabilized α/β structure  composed of three antiparallel β-strands and one α-helix which are organized in a βαββ configuration . analysis of the pgd <dig> primary sequence identified γ-core and α-core motifs 
 <cit> , as shown in figure 
3b.

recombinant production and purification of pgd5
the his6-sumo-pgd <dig> fusion was successfully expressed in e. coli bl <dig>  de <dig>  the recombinant fusion protein of  <dig> kda was efficiently produced in soluble form and purified to > 90% purity by ni-nta column chromatography in a single step . the sumo-tag was removed by the sumo protease. the resulting protein products were further purified using a c <dig> reversed phase chromatography column and a tfa/acetonitrile gradient. recombinant pgd <dig> eluted at  <dig>  min  while the digested sumo-tag eluted at  <dig>  min  . sds-page analysis confirmed that pgd <dig> was successfully separated from the cleaved tag and purified to homogeneity . the purified peptide was further characterized by maldi-tof-ms. maldi-tof-ms analysis yielded a mass of  <dig>  da for the purified peptide, which is  <dig> da less than the theoretical mass calculated with the expasy-compute pi/mw tool of  <dig>  da . these data indicate that the four disulphide bridges which are common to all plant defensins were correctly formed. incubation of the peptide in  <dig> mm dtt reduced the disulphide bridges and completely inactivated the peptide.

antimicrobial activity of purified pgd5
antifungal activity of pgd <dig> was assayed by microspectrophotometry using a dose–response growth inhibition assay. pgd <dig> significantly inhibited the fungal growth over time in all fungal isolates tested even at very low concentrations. pgd <dig> was most active against v. dahliae  and b. cinerea , with ic <dig> values of  <dig> μg/ml and  <dig> μg/ml, respectively. however, pgd <dig> was less effective against f. oxysporum with an ic <dig> value of  <dig> μg/ml . treatment of v. dahliae spores, the causal agent of wilting disease, with a peptide concentration of  <dig> μg/ml resulted in > 90% growth inhibition, and a concentration of  <dig> μg/ml completely arrested spore germination . the antifungal activity of pgd <dig> was also determined in vitro with a plate assay on rhizoctonia solani. as illustrated in figure 
5d, there are inhibition zones of r. solani in areas containing sterile discs of filter paper on which various concentrations of purified pgd <dig> were applied. distilled water served as the negative control.

one characteristic feature of many cationic antimicrobial peptides is their ability to permeabilize the plasma membrane of target organisms. we examined membrane permeabilization using the fluorometric sytox green dye, which is taken up only by cells with compromised plasma membrane. microscopical analyses of fungal hyphae treated with pgd <dig> did not reveal increased hyphal branching and morphologically altered hyphae that are typically induced by some plant defensins 
 <cit>  . however, pgd <dig> strongly inhibited elongation of fungal hyphae. by measuring the sytox green uptake by fluorescence microscopy we observed that pgd <dig> induced membrane permeabilization in the three fungi tested. hyphae of pgd5-treated b. cinerea, f. oxysporum and v. dahliae had strong fluorescence in the cytosol , especially in the nuclei, when compared to the untreated fungi that showed no fluorescence . the ability of pgd <dig> to permeabilize the plasma membrane was also tested in s. cerevisiae. by fluorescence microscopy, pgd5-treated s. cerevisiae cells showed strong sytox green fluorescence in the cytosol  as compared to negative controls  , indicating that pgd <dig> also induced membrane permeabilization in the yeast cells. in contrast to these findings, pgd <dig> was not active against candida albicans at the concentration of  <dig> μg/ml .

recombinant pgd <dig> is heat-stable and moderately sensitive to cations
pgd <dig> was tested for its stability at various temperatures using the antifungal growth assay against v. dahliae. pgd <dig> was remarkably stable at temperatures of up to 100°c. seventy one percent of its antifungal activity was retained after  <dig> min of treatment at 75°c and 61% at 100°c . analysis of the effect of monovalent and divalent cations on antifungal activity of pgd <dig> showed that the divalent cation ca2+ diminished about 50% the antifungal activity of the peptide at the concentration of  <dig> mm. the monovalent cation k+ had no effect on the antifungal activity of pgd <dig> at the concentration of  <dig> mm .

discussion
characterization of plant defensin-encoding genes of picea glauca
plant defensins are a prominent family of cationic peptides that are ubiquitous among the plant kingdom and represent an important part of the plant innate immune system. previously, only two antifungal proteins have been described in p. glauca. the first pgd <dig> , is a plant defensin of  <dig> amino acids that displays antifungal activity against cylindrocladium floridanum, fusarium oxysporum, and nectria galligena at  <dig> μg/ml 
 <cit> . the second is an embryo-abundant protein of  <dig> amino acids that shares 85% similarity with an antifungal protein of ginkgo biloba <cit>  but lacks the characteristic features of plant defensins.

in the present work, the screening of the p. glauca est database using the tblastn algorithm resulted in identification of five new defensin-encoding genes . in addition to expanding the list of existing spruce defensins, our research on p. glauca defensins and their encoding genes gives insight into conifer biology and genomics. our results show that the habitual family of defensins found in angiosperms 
 <cit>  is also present in gymnosperms, giving another example of the high diversity of plant defensins.

defensins are expressed in different plant tissues including leaves, pods, tubers, fruits, roots, bark and floral organs 
 <cit> . they provide specific defensive capacity to the plant. the cdna library containing the est gq01307_a <dig> and est gq <dig> b7_k <dig> was constructed from mrna exclusively isolated from actively elongating roots tips free of mycorrhiza, indicating that pgd <dig> and endopiceasin genes might be expressed in a tissue-specific manner, only in the roots. to the best of our knowledge, these peptides are, along with defensin spi <dig> from norway spruce  
 <cit> , the only reported plant defensins that are expressed exclusively in the plant root system.

endopiceasin resembles the structure of classical defensins of fungi, insects and invertebrates with  <dig> cysteine residues connected by three disulphide-bridges that stabilize the csαβ motif 
 <cit> . pcr for isolation of endopiceasin did not result in a product and efforts to amplify the gene by changing the pcr conditions were unsuccessful. dna isolated from higher plants may originate from symbiotic microbes called endophytes occupying plant tissues at surprisingly high frequencies. accordingly, few reports have described dna sequences attributed to gymnosperms and angiosperms, which actually belong to specific endophytes 
 <cit> . we believe that est gq <dig> b7_k <dig> present in p. glauca cdna library originates from an endophyte or epiphytic fungal strain colonizing the root system of p. glauca. experiments are in progress to further identify the origin of the endopiceasin peptide. in this context, the high degree of similarity between endopiceasin and plectasin might be of special interest because plectasin is a potent peptide antibiotic with strong therapeutic potential 
 <cit> . we also confirmed the similarity of endopiceasin to plectasin by analysing its mode of action. endopiceasin was only active against gram-positive bacteria and its activity was based on inhibition of cell wall biosynthesis and lipid ii binding . in fact, endophytes that colonize internal plant tissues as mutualists have a role in protection of the plant against pathogens 
 <cit> , and our report indicates that antibacterial defensins from endophytes might play a significant role in such protection.

characteristic features of pgd5
pgd <dig> showed high similarity at amino acid level with related and unrelated plant defensins of the gymnospermae family , which supports the idea of a common origin of plant defensins. the presence of a typical secretion signal peptide is one of the characteristic features of plant defensins 
 <cit> . based on the precursor protein structure, pgd <dig> groups with class i of the defensin family 
 <cit> , containing an n-terminal signal peptide followed by the mature defensin domain. this is in contrast to class ii defensin peptides which have an additional c-terminal prodomain.

pgd <dig> appears completely conserved within the genus picea. there are many reports of plant defensins showing more than 96% identity within the same genus and differing only by one or two amino acids 
 <cit> , which turns into different antimicrobial activities. however, to our best knowledge, this is the first report on a plant defensin being fully conserved within a genus or, at least, within the seven different picea sp. analyzed in this work. this suggests a very specific role for the pgd <dig> gene being highly conserved during evolution of the genus picea.

antifungal activity of pgd5
pgd <dig> exhibited strong antifungal activity inhibiting growth of hyphae of four agronomically important pathogens: b. cinerea, an airbone pathogen of broadleaved and coniferous trees; r. solani, a soilborne pathogen of economically important agricultural plants and f. oxysporum and v. dahliae, which are the leading causes of wilting disease . based on the structural and functional similarity, pgd <dig> was included into the ‘’non-morphogenic” group of plant defensins, which slow down hyphal elongation but do not induce marked morphological distortions 
 <cit> . the activity exerted by pgd <dig> against the phytopathogenic fungi and s. cerevisiae was linked to alteration of fungal membrane permeability. the nuclei of these permeabilized hyphae appeared intact and the cytoplasm unaltered with no signs of granulation of the hyphal cytoplasm, which is observed in some defensins. however, pgd <dig> was not active against c. albicans at concentration of  <dig> μg/ml. probably pgd <dig> interacts with essential plasma membrane structures of s. cerevisiae that are not present in c. albicans, causing a structural disruption and alteration of the membrane permeability. however, more studies are necessary to discern whether the permeabilization itself is a result of the interaction of the plant defensins with components of the membrane, or with an intracellular target or signaling pathway triggered by the peptide 
 <cit> .

the antifungal potency of a peptide in the presence of cations is of particular importance for evaluation of defense capacity against microorganisms in plants. most plant defensins show little or no antifungal activity in the presence of monovalent and divalent cations in the growth medium at concentrations above  <dig> or  <dig> mm, respectively 
 <cit> . in these conditions, the interaction of plant defensins with their binding site dictates the specificity of the antifungal activity observed 
 <cit> . in the present study, pgd <dig> was shown to be highly heat stable and the antifungal activity against v. dahliae was unaffected in the presence of monovalent cation k+ and moderately affected in the presence of divalent cation ca++ . this makes pgd <dig> an attractive candidate in the fields of agricultural biotechnology and therapeutic drug design, with possible application as a transferable resistance trait for molecular breeding of crop plants.

CONCLUSIONS
screening of a est database of p. glauca resulted in the identification of four homologues of pgd <dig>  designated pgd2- <dig>  and endopiceasin which is probably of fungal origin. pgd <dig> codes for a defensin that is fully conserved within the genus picea. recombinant pgd <dig> displayed non-morphogenic antifungal activity, possibly associated with membrane permeabilization, at low concentrations against several fungal plant pathogens. the strong antifungal activity of pgd <dig> against v. dahliae even in high-ionic-strength medium is of special interest, making pgd <dig> an attractive candidate for engineering pathogen-resistant crops.
