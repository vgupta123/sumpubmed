BACKGROUND
trichoderma species are free living fungi that are commonly found in soil and woody materials. they are symbionts on plants and play an important role as antagonistic fungi towards pathogenic fungi  <cit> . trichoderma species are generally characterized by their rapid growth and ability to survive in variable environmental conditions. they are commonly found in agricultural lands, forests, and deserts. they are important contributors in the decomposition of plant materials. some species of trichoderma are economically important because of their ability to produce industrial enzymes and antibiotics  <cit> .

soil-based system is the preferable choice for production of vegetables in the arabian peninsula and in different parts of the world. however, due to poor soil characteristics , many growers tend to use potting media and organic fertilizers in the production system of vegetables. in addition, they also replace farm soil with uncultivated soil  in order to reduce populations of soilborn fungal pathogens  <cit> . trichoderma species are known to be very common in cultivated soils and potting media . however, no information is available concerning diversity of trichoderma in uncultivated soil and their relationship to trichoderma species from cultivated soil and potting media. this makes it difficult for growers to know the impact of soil replacement on lowering trichoderma diversity in farm soil.

populations of fungi can vary in their levels of genetic diversity from one species to the other  <cit> , one geographical region to the other  <cit>  and between different cultivation systems  <cit> . as a result, several molecular markers have been developed and used to characterize the level of genetic diversity within and among fungal populations. these include the use of isozyme variation, restriction fragment length polymorphism , amplified fragment length polymorphism  and random amplified polymorphic dna . aflp has been found to be powerful in the characterization of genetic diversity among and within populations of different fungi  <cit> .

this study was conducted to characterize the genetic diversity of trichoderma species in uncultivated soils and their genetic relationship with trichoderma species isolated from cultivated soils and potting media. results will provide a basis for future studies on trichoderma in soil and potting media.

RESULTS

all species were found to occur in potting media samples , with t. citrinoviride being the most common , followed by t. hamatum , t. harzianum , t. asperellum , t. atroviride , t. ghanense , t. longibrachiatum , t. orientalis , and t. viride .

isolations from cultivated soil  revealed the presence of t. asperellum , t. harzianum , t. citrinoviride , t. ghanense , and t. orientalis . on the other hand, isolations from the uncultivated soils  showed that the most common species were t. harzianum , t. asperellum , t. orientalis  and t. longibrachiatum .

the its rrna gene showed higher level of intraspecific variation compared to the ef <dig> gene, which gave higher resolution in separating trichoderma species. the bootstrap support for separating species from each other was 99 % for the ef <dig> gene . however, the bootstrap support for separating species based on the its rrna gene showed that it ranges from  <dig> to 100 %, with one species  not forming a tight cluster . when the sequences of its rdna and ef <dig> were used to produce a single tree, the resolution in separating trichoderma species imporved to 99–100 % bootstrap support .

no relationship was observed between clustering of the isolates based on its rdna or ef <dig> sequences and clustering based on the substrates from which the isolates were obtained . for example, t. harzianum isolates grouped into several sub-clusters. however, neither its-based sub-clustering, nor ef1-based sub-clustering correlated with the substrates from which the isolates were obtained. all its and ef <dig> sequences were deposited in the european nucleotide archive .table  <dig> characteristics of trichoderma species collected from cultivated and uncultivated soils and potting media

analysis of diversity within populations of trichoderma species
analysis of  <dig> trichoderma isolates using  <dig> primer-pair combinations produced  <dig> polymorphic loci , with the percentage of polymorphic loci ranging from 16 % to 80 % for the different trichoderma species. the number of polymorphic loci produced by the three primer combinations were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . the three primer pair combinations also resulted in moderate levels of nei’s gene diversity, which were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively.

aflp analysis of the  <dig> trichoderma isolates produced  <dig> different aflp genotypes . each isolate representing a genotype differed from the others by at least  <dig> alleles. trichoderma isolates showed a moderate level of genetic diversity . trichoderma viride was excluded from population specific analysis of genotypic and genetic diversity because it consisted of one isolate. the seven populations differed in their level of gene diversity. the percent polymorphic loci ranged from  <dig> to 80 % and nei’s gene diversity estimates ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  .table  <dig> genotypic and genetic analysis of trichoderma species obtained from potting media, uncultivated soils and cultivated soils in oman

genetic similarity and cluster analysis
the level of genetic similarity among the seven populations was found to vary from  <dig> to 99 %. t. asperellum, t. harzianum and t. citrinoviride were found to share a high level of genetic similarity . trichoderma atroviride shared the least level of genetic similarity with other trichoderma species. cluster analysis showed that t. asperellum, t. harzianum, t. citrinoviride, t. ghanense and t. longibrachiatum clustered together . cluster analysis of the three most common species  showed that there was no relationship between clustering of isolate of the same species and the substrata from which they were isolated . in addition, there was no relationship between clustering of trichoderma isolates and the species they belong to.

partition of genetic variation
analysis showed that the percent genetic variation is  <dig>  % among populations of t. asperellum obtained from potting media, cultivated soil and uncultivated soil . the percent genetic variation among populations of t. harzianum obtained from potting media, cultivated soil and uncultivated soil was found to be  <dig>  % . these values indicate that most of the genetic variation is within populations of the same species. they also indicate that the level of gene flow among populations of fungal isolates is high among potting media, cultivated soil and uncultivated soil.

discussion
trichoderma is a widespread genus of fungi. previous studies in oman provided evidence for occurrence of t. hamatum in the greenhouse soil  <cit>  and t. harzianum, and t. parceramosum in desert crusts  <cit> . our current investigation revealed presence of  <dig> trichoderma species in potting media samples,  <dig> species in cultivated soil samples and  <dig> species in uncultivated soil samples. the higher level of diversity in trichoderma species in potting media is related to the fact that these material consist of different organic and inorganic ingredients including peat moss, sphagnum, shredded bark, sawdust, vermiculite, perlite, clay and sand  <cit> . the trichoderma species could have therefore been naturally occurring in these products or they could have been introduced after composting  <cit> .

identification of trichoderma to the species level based on reference sequences from the national center for biotechnology information correlated with phylogenic analysis based on sequences of the its rrna and ef <dig> genes. however, the limited intraspecific variation within trichoderma species based on sequences of the ef <dig> gene helped gave better resolution in separating trichoderma species when compared to sequences of the its region. the ef <dig> gene, especially when combined with its rdna data, can give better resolution and is increasingly used in the identification of several fungal species  <cit> .

the frequency of isolation of trichoderma from cultivated soil  was higher than that from uncultivated soil . since none of the sampled farms add commercial products of trichoderma to soil, trichoderma isolates could have been naturally occurring in the cultivated soil. another possible source of trichoderma into farms is the use of potting media. many farmers in oman use potting media products for germination of vegetable crops or in soil  <cit> . since findings from this study and from previous studies indicated that potting media act as a source of trichoderma  <cit> , it is possible that potting media contributed to moving trichoderma isolates to cultivated soils. this is supported by amova analysis which indicated the presence of low levels of genetic differentiation and high levels of gene flow among trichoderma populations obtained from cultivated soil and potting media .

our study showed the occurrence of four trichoderma species in soils with no previous history of cultivation. wind driven sand, which is common is oman, could have contributed to moving some trichoderma propagules to areas without vegetation  <cit> . the lack of relationship between aflp based clustering of trichoderma isolates and their origin as well as the insignificantly  very low levels of genetic differentiation among populations of the same species obtained from cultivated and uncultivated soils may explain the hypothesis of movement of trichoderma isolates between cultivated and uncultivated soils. in addition, some of the trichoderma isolates were recovered from soil trapped behind dams. during rainy periods in oman, which are very limited in this part of the world, the flowing water from mountainous areas is usually trapped behind dams. since it is common to find acacia spp. and some other plants in the way of the flowing water, it is possible that trichoderma propagules could have been moved by the flowing water and then deposited in the dam soil. a study is in progress to characterize naturally occurring fungal species in the path of flowing water and from the rhizosphere of wild plants.

farmers in oman usually replace farm soils with uncultivated soils imported from soils trapped behind dams or non-cultivated lands. besides reducing pathogen inoculum in farms  <cit> , this practice could help introduce beneficial trichoderma isolates, especially t. asperellum and t. harzianum, into farms.

several species of trichoderma have been long used as biological control agents to manage diseases of vegetable and other crops  <cit> . trichoderma harzianum and t. asperellum are the two most common species and were isolated from potting media, cultivated soil and uncultivated soil. t. harzianum is a common species in soil and potting media and it is commercially used as a biological control agent  <cit> . t. asperellum has been used for induction of resistance to different diseases  <cit> . the relatively high level of occurrence of t. asperellum and t. harzianum in oman soils  might contribute to improving soil health through disease suppression in different crop systems

the overall level of genetic diversity of trichoderma isolates was found to be moderate . the level of genetic diversity for the different species varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> . however, clustering based on aflp data did not correlate with sources of the isolates, nor with clustering based on the its rrna and the ef <dig> genes. variation in the level of genetic diversity and sequences among the different species could be related to several reasons. multiple introductions of trichoderma isolates into oman could have played a major role in augmenting the genetic diversity of trichoderma populations  <cit> . the hypothesis of multiple introductions is supported by the formation of several aflp genotypes and the lack of relationship between aflp data and the source of the isolates. it is also supported by the lack of relationship between its/ef <dig> based clustering and the sources of trichoderma isolates. this may indicate that the isolates were introduced at different times and from different sources. other factors which could have affected the level of genetic diversity is the differences in the reproduction modes and the level of sexual recombination between the different species  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study provided evidence that the diversity in trichoderma species varies from one substrate to the other. this is the first report showing t. asperellum, t. ghanense, t. longibrachiatum and t. orientalis in oman. aflp analysis suggested possible introductions of trichoderma isolates from potting media into cultivated soil and also movement of trichoderma between cultivated and uncultivated soils. the relatively high level of diversity in trichoderma species and isolates may give an indication about the health of soil and its ability to contribute in the suppression of soilborn diseases that affect different crops. in addition, the high diversity may make it possible to find and select trichoderma isolates with high antagonistic properties. studies are in progress to characterize the biological properties of some of the trichoderma isolates obtained in this study. future studies are required to focus on characterizing trichoderma isolates and other biocontrol agents from extreme environments in order to come up with isolates that can tolerate the harsh conditions of arid countries.
