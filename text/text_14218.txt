BACKGROUND
the vertebrate inner ear develops from the otic vesicle, which forms via invagination of specified ectodermal cells adjacent to the hindbrain. a crucial phase in development of the sensory structures of the inner ear occurs as the otic epithelium acquires regional identity along its axes. classic explant experiments by developmental biologists first suggested that otic patterning occurred in response to signals from surrounding tissues, and recent work has revealed much of the molecular basis of these interactions . for example, genetic studies in the mouse showed that genes expressed along the dorsoventral axis of the otic vesicle are induced by signals from the roof plate and floor plate of the neural tube  <cit> . specifically, members of the wnt family of morphogens, secreted from the dorsal hindbrain, regulate the expression of dorsal genes required for development of vestibular structures, while sonic hedgehog  secreted from the ventral hindbrain and notochord is necessary for the expression of ventral genes that promote cochlear formation.

proper patterning of the otic vesicle is essential for subsequent growth and morphogenesis of the inner ear. in the ensuing stages of development, genes expressed within the otic vesicle are known to direct formation of the cochlea and vestibular structures. however, surrounding tissues continue to play an important role. shh promotes outgrowth of the cochlear duct via activation of gli <dig> and gli <dig> in the otic vesicle and surrounding mesenchyme  <cit> . in addition, periotic mesenchyme  cells condense around the otic vesicle and undergo chondrogenesis to give rise to the otic capsule, which surrounds and protects the inner ear sensory structures. the close association between the pom and the otic epithelium suggests that epithelial-mesenchymal interactions exist between these two tissues, and disruption of these interactions could lead to defects in inner ear formation. indeed, multiple mouse mutants indicate that signaling from the epithelium to the mesenchyme is crucial for capsule formation and is dependent upon members of the fibroblast growth factor  and bone morphogenic protein  gene families  <cit> .

evidence supporting a requirement for signals from the pom to the otic vesicle during inner ear formation also exists. explant experiments demonstrated that cultured otic vesicle epithelium failed to form differentiated hair cells in the absence of surrounding pom cells  <cit> . furthermore, mice null for brn <dig>  a pou-domain transcription factor expressed in the pom but not the otic vesicle, display a reduction in the number of turns of the cochlea  <cit> . these data indicate a cell nonautonomous role for the pom during inner ear development.

tbx <dig> is a member of a large family of transcription factors called t-box genes that have important roles in embryonic development. haploinsufficiency of tbx <dig> in humans is associated with velo-cardio-facial syndrome/digeorge syndrome , which causes sensorineural hearing loss in approximately 10% of patients  <cit> . in the mouse, tbx <dig> is essential for the development of the inner ear, evidenced by the lack of both auditory and vestibular structures as well as an expansion of the cochleovestibular ganglion  in tbx <dig> null mutants  <cit> . during embryogenesis, tbx <dig> is expressed in both in the otic vesicle and in the ventral pom cells that lie between the source of shh and the otic vesicle. conditional ablation of tbx <dig> expression in the otic vesicle results in an inner ear phenotype identical to that of tbx1-/- embryos, indicating a tissue autonomous role for tbx <dig> in otic vesicle patterning  <cit> . however, the pom domain of tbx <dig> was also shown to be essential for normal outgrowth of the cochlear duct, supporting a role for the mesenchyme in morphogenesis of the inner ear epithelium  <cit> .

these data support a model in which cochlear outgrowth is regulated by shh signaling from the ventral midline via genes expressed in the pom and the otic vesicle. expression of both tbx <dig> and brn <dig> in the pom is responsive to shh signaling, and is lost in shh null mutants  <cit> . in contrast, tbx <dig> expression in the otic vesicle is unaffected in shh-/- embryos  <cit> . this indicates that the mechanism by which shh regulates cochlear duct outgrowth may be distinct from its regulation of otic vesicle patterning.

to further characterize the role of the pom in inner ear morphogenesis and identify genes downstream of tbx <dig> and brn <dig> signaling to the otic vesicle, we generated mutants in which tbx <dig> was specifically ablated in the mesoderm. t-cre mediated conditional mutants  displayed severe defects in growth and coiling of the cochlear duct, similar to a comparable tbx <dig> mutant using an alternative cre driver  <cit> . to determine the molecular basis for these defects, brn <dig> protein expression was examined in tcre-ko mutants, since adult brn4-;tbx1+/- mice also display a reduction in the number of cochlear turns  <cit> . expression of brn <dig> was lost in the pom in conditional mutants, and brn4-;tbx1+/- embryos exhibited similar but less severe defects in cochlear coiling compared to tcre-ko embryos. further, expression of retinoic acid  metabolizing enzymes was examined because ra has been implicated in the control of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions  <cit> . we identified changes in the expression of ra catabolizing enzymes cyp26a <dig> and cyp26c <dig> in both tcre-ko and brn4-;tbx1+/-mutants. these results support a role for tbx <dig> and brn <dig> in regulating levels of ra in the pom required for inner ear morphogenesis.

RESULTS
the inner ears of tcre-ko embryos are malformed
to assess the role of tbx <dig> in the pom, conditional mutants were created in which tbx <dig> expression was ablated in all mesodermal tissues. this mutant was generated by crossing mice carrying the tbx1flox allele with t-cre transgenic mice to obtain t-cre;tbx1flox/- embryos . to confirm that cre activity was restricted to the mesoderm, t-cre mice were crossed with the rosa <dig> reporter strain  <cit>  and offspring were analyzed for lacz expression. at e <dig>  and e <dig> , cre activity was detected in the mesodermal cells surrounding the otic vesicle and not in the otic epithelium . analysis of tbx <dig> expression at e <dig>  and e <dig>  in tcre-ko embryos revealed reduced tbx <dig> expression in the mesoderm compared to control  embryos, while tbx <dig> expression in the otic vesicle was unaffected . analysis of tcre-ko embryos using an anti-tbx <dig> antibody  confirmed that the residual tbx <dig> expression was not due to an aberrant transcript . these data indicated that the tcre-ko mutant was a mesodermal hypomorph. supporting this, tcre-ko mutants displayed a phenotype that closely matched another tbx <dig> mesodermal conditional mutant generated using the mesp1-cre driver  <cit> . analysis of the inner ear of both mutants by paint-fill  revealed slightly variable but overlapping phenotypes, however the most severely affected inners ear of tcre-ko embryos displayed a shorter cochlear duct than mesp1cre-ko mutants . mesp1cre-ko mutants were also found to be hypomorphic following examination of tbx <dig> expression . thus, mesodermal expression of tbx <dig> in the tcre-ko mutant appears to be reduced to a level sufficient to isolate the role of tbx <dig> in the pom.

examination of the membranous labyrinth of tcre-ko embryos revealed multiple defects. the cochlea normally forms one and three quarter turns in the mouse by e <dig>  . at this stage,  <dig> of  <dig> tcre-ko embryos displayed a severely shortened cochlea with only the most basal, or hook region, present . two tcre-ko embryos displayed an abnormal but slightly longer cochlea . the vestibular system exhibited consistent mild hypoplasia, however the semicircular canals, utricle and saccule were always present. in addition, the endolymphatic duct and sac were enlarged , reminiscent of mondini dysplasia. histological sections through the inner ear of tcre-ko embryos at e <dig>   confirmed the cochlear defects seen by paint-fill and revealed a lack of a recognizable organ of corti . this is consistent with the sensory organ defects reported in mesp1cre-ko mutants, which displayed a lack of hair cells in the medial and apical cochlea evidenced by the absence of myosin 7a expression  <cit> . in addition, tcre-ko embryos displayed abnormalities in the structure of the otic capsule . interestingly, the capsule surrounding the vestibular system appeared relatively unaffected, while the cochlear capsule was severely malformed. this was easily appreciated upon bone and cartilage staining of tcre-ko embryos . the capsule malformations may be due to defects in the pom, or secondary to the malformations of the membranous labyrinth.

otic patterning appears unaffected in tcre-ko mutants
ventral structures of the inner ear in tcre-ko embryos were more severely affected than dorsal structures, consistent with the localization of tbx <dig> expression in the ventral pom during inner ear morphogenesis . because shh is known to regulate the expression of ventral markers in the otic vesicle, we speculated that patterning of the dorsoventral axis might be abnormal in tcre-ko embryos. analysis of ventral sensory markers pax <dig> and otx <dig> and dorsal markers bmp <dig> and dlx <dig> revealed no changes in expression in the otic vesicle of tcre-ko embryos versus controls at e <dig>  . this suggests that early dorsoventral patterning occurs normally in the absence of mesodermal tbx <dig>  in addition, expression of gata <dig>  a lateral marker, as well as anterior markers neurod, fgf <dig>  fgf <dig> and lnfg, was unchanged in tcre-ko mutants compared to controls at e <dig>  . lmx1a, which has been shown to be required for development of the endolymphatic duct  <cit> , is also unchanged in tcre-ko embryos at this stage . this indicates that early otic patterning and formation of the cvg are likely unaffected in tcre-ko mutants. this is consistent with the reported normal expression of neurogenic markers isl <dig> and ngn <dig> in mesp1cre-ko embryos at the same stage  <cit> .

to ascertain the stage in which changes in gene expression might first appear in the tcre-ko mutants, we identified the onset of morphological defects in mutant embryos. at e <dig> , the otic vesicles of tcre-ko embryos were indistinguishable in overall size and shape from control otic vesicles , consistent with the lack of expression changes of molecular markers. however, at e <dig>  tcre-ko embryos exhibited a malformed and hypoplastic otic vesicle that was easily distinguished from controls . thus, physical defects in the otic vesicles tcre-ko embryos do not appear until after axis determination is complete, consistent with a role for tbx <dig> expression in the pom in otic patterning.

tcre-ko embryos display defects in cell proliferation and survival
tbx <dig> has previously been shown to regulate the mitotic activity of the otic epithelium  <cit> , indicating the abnormal inner ears seen in tcre-ko embryos may be due to defects in cell proliferation. to test this hypothesis, mutant and control embryos were analyzed at e <dig>  using an antibody to the m-phase marker phospho-histone  <dig> . this stage was chosen because it corresponds with the onset of morphological defects in the otic vesicle of tcre-ko embryos. proliferating cells were counted in transverse sections through the entire otic vesicle of mutant and control embryos . a significant reduction in proliferating cells was apparent , with an average of  <dig>  and  <dig>  positive cells per section in mutant versus control, respectively . proliferating cells were also counted in the dorsal and ventral halves of the otic vesicle, and both of these regions displayed a decrease in proliferation in mutant compared to control embryos . interestingly, no significant difference in proliferation was observed when dorsal and ventral halves of the tcre-ko mutants were compared directly . this suggests that cell proliferation is reduced broadly throughout the entire otic vesicle, as opposed to a localization of defects in the dorsal or ventral epithelium. we next tested whether proliferation of pom cells was affected in tcre-ko mutants. at e <dig> , the cells of the pom have only just begun to condense around the otic vesicle and have not yet formed a well-defined population. we assessed cell proliferation in the pom of tcre-ko embryos by counting positive cells in an arbitrarily defined region of mesenchyme surrounding the otic vesicle. proliferation was found to be unaffected in tcre-ko embryos compared to controls , suggesting that tbx <dig> does not exert a tissue autonomous affect on proliferation of pom cells at this stage.

we next asked whether the otic epithelium of tcre-ko embryos displayed changes in cell survival using an antibody to the apoptotic marker activated caspase  <dig>  at e <dig> , a significant increase in cell death was observed in the otic vesicle of tcre-ko embryos compared to controls , with an average of  <dig>  and  <dig>  apoptotic cells per section in mutant versus control embryos, respectively . this indicates that tbx <dig> expression in the pom has a modest affect on survival of the otic epithelium. interestingly, apoptotic cells were not observed in the pom of tcre-ko or control embryos at this stage . these data suggest that tbx <dig> has a role in regulating paracrine signaling to the otic epithelium prior to capsule formation.

tbx <dig> and brn <dig> interact in the pom
a previous study showed that protein expression of brn <dig>  a marker for the pom, was lost in tbx <dig> null mice but present in conditional mutants in which tbx <dig> was ablated in the otic vesicle and pharyngeal endoderm  <cit> . this suggested that the pom domain of tbx <dig> regulates brn <dig> or proliferation of brn4-expressing cells. to test this hypothesis, brn <dig> expression was examined in tcre-ko embryos and was indeed reduced in the pom at e <dig>  .

we recently established a genetic interaction between tbx <dig> and brn <dig> in the inner ear, as adult brn4-;tbx1+/- mice display a significant reduction in the number of cochlear turns compared to brn4- or tbx1+/- mice alone  <cit> . to determine the morphological basis of this interaction, the membranous labyrinth of compound mutants of tbx <dig> and brn <dig> was analyzed by paint-fill experiments. at e <dig> , all tbx1+/-  and brn4+/-;tbx1+/-  embryos exhibited grossly normal inner ear structures . furthermore, the majority of brn4- mutants  also exhibited normal inner ears with a completely coiled cochlea . two brn4- mice displayed a slightly shortened cochlea of  <dig>  turns . we then asked whether the addition of a single tbxl null allele would affect the penetrance of the brn <dig> null phenotype. all brn4-;tbx1+/- mutants  exhibited one cochlear turn followed by abnormal twisting and termination of the cochlear duct . in some cases, the cochlear duct bifurcated before terminating prematurely . these data indicate that tbx <dig> may function in parallel with brn <dig> to regulate a common downstream pathway important for cochlear growth.

tbx <dig> regulates ra metabolism in the pom
the defects seen in tcre-ko and brn4-;tbx1+/- embryos suggest a non-autonomous role for tbx <dig> and brn <dig> in the pom during cochlear outgrowth. because both genes are nuclear transcription factors, they may act on a common downstream target that signals to the otic vesicle. one likely candidate is retinoic acid , which is known to be important for epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during inner ear development  <cit> . tbx1-/- embryos carrying a ra response element reporter construct  <cit>  exhibited increased ra activity in the pharyngeal mesenchyme, including the pom, at e <dig>  and e <dig>   <cit> . further, expression of cyp <dig> enzymes that catabolize active ra was reduced in these same tissues in tbx1-/- embryos  <cit> . we hypothesized that the inner ear defects present in the tcre-ko mutant might be due to abnormal ra metabolism caused by a reduction of cyp <dig> gene expression. of the three cyp <dig> genes that catabolize ra, both cyp26a <dig> and cyp26c <dig> are co-expressed with tbx <dig> in the pom  <cit> . to test if mesenchymal tbx <dig> regulates these genes, expression analysis was performed on tcre-ko embryos.

cyp26a <dig> and cyp26c <dig> are expressed in similar patterns in the inner ear  <cit> . both genes are restricted to the lateral and ventral pom at e <dig>  and e <dig> , which corresponds to the mesenchymal cells adjacent to the developing cochlear duct . cyp26c <dig> is also found in the lateral wall of the cochlear duct epithelium . the expression of these genes in the pom significantly overlaps with tbx <dig> expression at these stages . at e <dig>  in tcre-ko embryos, cyp26a <dig> expression was missing from the lateral pom and appeared to be shifted to a more ventral position . transverse sections through the otic vesicle confirmed the absence of cyp26a <dig> expression in the lateral pom . further, expression of cyp26c <dig> was strongly reduced in the mesenchyme at e <dig>  in tcre-ko mutants, while first arch expression was unaffected . the reduction of cyp26c <dig> expression is particularly evident in the pom immediately posterior to the otic vesicle . expression of cyp26b <dig>  which is predominately in the dorsal pom, was unchanged in tcre-ko mutants .

the shift of cyp26a <dig> expression from a lateral to a medial position was also apparent at e <dig>  in tcre-ko embryos compared to controls . this change in expression was more pronounced in posterior sections through the developing cochlear duct . also at this stage, cyp26c <dig> expression was strongly reduced in the ventral pom of tcre-ko mutants, while expression in the cochlear duct epithelium was unaffected .

this data suggests that tbx <dig> acts upstream of two cyp <dig> genes expressed in the medial and ventral pom. to further test this hypothesis, expression of cyp26a <dig> and cyp26c <dig> was analyzed in tbx1+/-, brn4- and brn4-;tbx1+/- embryos. if brn <dig> and tbx <dig> both act upstream of a common target in the pom, then brn4-;tbx1+/- embryos might display a similar change in cyp26a <dig> and cyp26c <dig> expression as seen in tcre-ko embryos. in tbx1+/-, brn4- and brn4-;tbx1+/- embryos at e <dig> , expression of cyp26a <dig> was unchanged . however, cyp26c <dig> expression was reduced in the ventral pom of brn4-;tbx1+/- embryos compared to tbx1+/- and brn4- embryos . further, cyp26c <dig> is co-expressed with tbx <dig> in the ventral pom surrounding the cochlear duct at this stage . together with the results seen in tcre-ko mutants, these data indicate that cyp26c <dig> is more sensitive to tbx <dig> dosage than cyp26a <dig>  in addition, they suggest that tbx <dig> and brn <dig> act in concert to regulate ra activity in the pom, consistent with increased mesenchymal ra signaling observed in tbx1-/-embryos.

discussion
distinct roles of tbx <dig> in the otic vesicle and pom
during inner ear development, tbx <dig> is expressed in the ventral mesenchyme cells that surround the otic vesicle and give rise to the cochlear capsule. tcre-ko embryos displayed malformations in both the otic capsule and membranous labyrinth, with ventral structures most severely affected. these results indicate that tbx <dig> expression in the pom is essential for development of the epithelial structures of the inner ear. there are two potential explanations for this phenotype. it is possible that mesodermal tbx <dig> is required for proper formation of the otic capsule, and abnormal condensation or differentiation of the pom prohibits proper outgrowth and coiling of the cochlea. an alternative, yet not mutually exclusive, explanation is that ablation of mesodermal tbx <dig> disrupts signaling to the cochlear epithelium, altering the expression of genes critical to the formation of the membranous labyrinth and subsequently the otic capsule. this latter scenario is supported by the presence of physical malformations and a decrease in cell survival in the otic vesicle of tcre-ko embryos prior to capsule formation. we provide evidence that signaling to the otic epithelium occurs via ra, and propose that proper control of ra activity by the pom domain of tbx <dig> is required for normal development of the inner ear.

the data from this and previous studies support distinct and independent roles for tbx <dig> in the otic vesicle and pom, despite the close proximity of these tissues during development. expression of tbx <dig> in the otic vesicle functions just after induction of the otic placode, and is required for specification of neural versus sensory cell fate. this is accomplished via inhibition of neurogenic genes such as ngn <dig> and neurod, while promoting expression of sensory markers such as otx <dig> and bmp <dig>  <cit> . in contrast, expression of tbx <dig> in the pom does not appear to be required until after the major patterning events of the inner ear have occurred and the otic vesicle has acquired its axial identities. indeed, sensory and neurogenic markers are expressed normally in the otic vesicle of tcre-ko embryos at e <dig> . due to the hypomorphic nature of the tcre-ko allele, we cannot exclude the possibility that sufficient tbx <dig> expression exists at earlier stages to obscure a subtle patterning phenotype. however, lack of patterning defects in mesp1cre-ko using a different floxed allele  <cit>  embryos argues against this alternative.

genes interacting with tbx <dig> in the pom
we have previously identified a genetic interaction between tbx <dig> and brn <dig> in the pom  <cit> . mice null for brn <dig> display a reduction in the number of cochlear turns, although the penetrance of this phenotype is incomplete and is less severe than the cochlear defects observed in the tcre-ko mutant  <cit> . brn <dig> protein expression was reduced in tcre-ko embryos at e <dig> , indicating that tbx <dig> may regulate transcription of brn <dig>  alternatively, it is possible that brn <dig> expression is lost due to a reduction in the number of pom cells in the tcre-ko mutant. although no changes in proliferation or apoptosis were observed in the pom at e <dig> , tbx <dig> is expressed in only a subset of cells in the pom and confining the analysis to tbx1-expressing mesenchymal cells may reveal a proliferation defect in this tissue. nevertheless, the completely penetrant cochlear phenotype observed in brn4-;tbx1+/- embryos together with the absence of detectable defects in brn4+/-;tbx1+/- embryos suggest that these genes act in parallel pathways.

as previously mentioned, shh secreted from the ventral midline regulates expression of tbx <dig> in the pom, and tbx <dig> is expressed in the ventral pom closest to the source of shh . we hypothesize that tbx <dig> functions in parallel with brn <dig> to modulate gene expression in a critical subset of pom cells on the ventral border of the otic vesicle, and that interactions between these cells and the otic epithelium are necessary for proper cochlea formation . recently, a model was proposed in which shh functions in two phases to regulate cochlear duct morphogenesis  <cit> . in early development, shh secreted from the ventral midline regulates patterning of the ventral otic vesicle by antagonizing the gli <dig> repressor protein. in the later phase, shh promotes outgrowth of the distal portion of the cochlear duct via recruitment of gli activators. the cochlear defects seen in the mutants analyzed in this study indicate that tbx <dig> and brn <dig> likely act downstream of shh in this second phase of development. supporting this is the expression of mediators of shh signaling, ptc <dig>  gli <dig>  gli <dig> and gli <dig>  in the ventral pom  <cit> . in addition, the forkhead box transcription factors foxc <dig> and foxc <dig> are known to directly activate tbx <dig> expression in the pom by binding to an enhancer, downstream of shh  <cit> . this places these fox genes downstream of gli signaling but upstream of tbx <dig> 

tbx <dig> may regulate ra activity
our data support a model in which brn <dig> and tbx <dig> act cooperatively on the same downstream target to promote proper growth of the cochlear duct. altered expression of cyp <dig> genes in the pom of mutant embryos indicates that ra may be one of these targets . in the ear, ra activity is regulated via metabolizing enzymes that are expressed in both the otic vesicle and the pom  <cit> . expression of the raldh genes is mainly confined to the epithelium, while the cyp <dig> genes localize to the mesenchyme  <cit> . expression of both cyp26a <dig> and cyp26c <dig> was altered in the pom at e <dig>  and e <dig>  in tcre-ko embryos, while cyp26c <dig> was also reduced in brn4-;tbx1+/- embryos at e <dig> . these data indicate that tbx <dig>  and to a lesser extent brn <dig>  are required to maintain expression of cyp26a <dig> and cyp26c <dig> in the pom during inner ear development. loss of tbx <dig> in the pom also caused a decrease in cell proliferation and an increase in apoptosis in the otic epithelium at e <dig> . these defects were not localized to the ventral epithelium, but were instead observed throughout the entire otic vesicle. while unexpected, this result may be due to the diffusible nature of ra, and provides an explanation for the reduction in size seen in dissected otic vesicles of tcre-ko embryos at this stage. alternatively, it could be due to normal cell movement within the tissue.

mouse mutants in which ra activity is increased during embryogenesis, either by null mutation of the cyp <dig> genes or exposure to ectopic ra, display abnormal segmentation of the hindbrain  <cit> . without the proper external cues emanating from this tissue, otic vesicle patterning and morphogenesis is abnormal  <cit> . because of these early defects, however, the function of ra at later stages of ear development is not as well understood. ectopic ra activity due to decreased catabolization could lead to the cochlear malformations seen in tcre-ko and brn4-;tbx1+/- embryos via ra action on the otic vesicle, pom or both. cyp <dig> enzymes expressed in the pom may function to inactivate excess ra produced by the epithelium, preventing abnormal regulation of ra target genes in the otic vesicle. supporting this, adminstration of ectopic ra after otic specification is complete results in hypoplastic, malformed inner ears in both mouse and chick  <cit> . in addition, genes important for cochlear development were shown to be inhibited by increased ra levels  <cit> . it is also possible that genes in the pom are responsive to excess ra, leading to defects in remodeling around the growing cochlear duct and preventing proper cochlear coiling. this has been demonstrated by the inhibition of capsule chondrogenesis following ra treatment of cultured otic explants of mouse embryos  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have further described the genetic interaction between tbx <dig> and brn <dig> and shown that these genes regulate ra catabolizing genes in the pom during inner ear morphogenesis. our results add to the evidence supporting a tissue non-autonomous role of the pom during development of the inner ear. future studies will focus on gaining a better understanding of the relationship between tbx <dig> and ra signaling in inner ear development, and identifying novel downstream targets of tbx <dig> in the pom.
