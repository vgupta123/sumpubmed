BACKGROUND
species coexistence is believed to be niche-based  <cit> . however, for hybrid complexes, opinions differ as to whether environment-specific differential selection is important for the geographic distribution and diversity of hybrid genotypes. theory has developed along two lines, both represented by two opposing, but not mutually exclusive models. within each line, the first model assumes environment-specific differential selection on hybrids, whereas the alternative model assumes that selection on hybrids does not vary among environments. the first line applies to the mixture of hybrids and their parental species . the second line concerns hybrid clones . however, for hybrids that are neither sympatric with their parental species, nor clonal, theories have not been formulated and, consequently, the role of differential selection in determining the geographic distribution and diversity of such hybrids is unknown.

the edible frog, pelophylax esculentus  constitutes an example of a hybrid that can form all-hybrid populations that are neither sympatric with parental species  <cit>  nor clonal  <cit> . these hybrids demonstrate such extreme hybrid superiority that parental species genotypes continuously arising from hybrid × hybrid matings are constantly outcompeted  <cit>  and thus virtually absent among adults. still, various genotype classes are present, as the hybrids include both diploid and triploid forms. genotype proportions have been observed to vary among ponds, and it remains to be assessed whether differential selection among ponds is responsible.

within the genus of water frogs, pelophylax, the edible frog, p. esculentus , arose and still arises by matings between the pool frog, p. lessonae , and the marsh frog, p. ridibundus . as indicated by the names, the two parental species have different habitat preferences within their largely overlapping distribution areas that cover most of europe. the smaller p. lessonae lives in pools and ponds while the larger p. ridibundus prefers lakes and river-influenced water bodies  <cit> . the p. esculentus hybrids have the broader habitat tolerance and usually co-occur with at least one of the parental species.

the hybrids reproduce by hybridogenesis, which implies that genetic recombination does normally not take place between l and r genomes in hybrids. instead, gametes contain one or the other genome, or both, but not a mixture. hybrids are thus formed anew every generation by the fusion of two gametes with different genomic contents. in the all-hybrid populations of southern sweden that were investigated in this study, llr frogs of both sexes make mostly l gametes , lrr of both sexes make r gametes, lr females make lr and some r eggs while lr males make r and rarely also lr or l sperm . when two l or two r gametes combine, offspring with parental species genotypes  arise, but under natural conditions they die before sexual maturity  <cit> . sex determination is an xx-xy system with a male-determining y factor located in one l genome in males  <cit> . as a consequence, lrr males are rare, except in ponds with high frequencies of lr sperm  <cit> . tetraploids are also rare  <cit> . the remaining five hybrid genotypes, llr and lr males, llr, lr and lrr females, are frequent in almost all ponds  <cit> .

because the various genotypes propagate each other rather than themselves , the populations are self-sustaining and should constantly be drawn to a gamete pattern-determined stable equilibrium  <cit> . yet, variation in the proportions of llr, lr and lrr among ponds has been observed  <cit> . it remains to be established how such variation can be generated; especially if it does not result from stochastic events, but is maintained over time. two hypotheses have been proposed to explain such persistent equilibrium differences: 1) variation in selection regimes among ponds  <cit> ; here called the selection hypothesis. 2) variation in gamete patterns among ponds  <cit> ; here called the gamete pattern hypothesis. a third possibility is that both selection and gamete pattern contribute to the variation in genotype compositions among ponds. they could either act antagonistically, or pond-specific gamete patterns could be adapted to the local selection regime.

the selection hypothesis is based on the observation of differences among p. lessonae, p. ridibundus and p. esculentus in adult habitat preference and in larval performance under various ecological conditions, as found by a variety of studies  <cit> . ecological differences could thus also exist within hybrid genotypes, i.e. among llr, lr and lrr. such differences could either be a consequence of a dosage effect, as observed in morphometry , where there is a cline from ll through llr, lr and lrr to rr  <cit> , or as a consequence of triploids having larger cells, as observed in erythrocytes  <cit> . the only study comparing fitness of llr, lr and lrr in different habitats was, however, not very conclusive: the prevalence of adult llr was positively correlated with human constructions and that of lr adults with forest around the breeding pond, but the majority of ecological parameters measured were not significantly correlated with genotype proportions  <cit> .

the gamete pattern hypothesis is based on a study showing a tendency for variation in gamete patterns among ponds  <cit> . the sample size was not sufficiently large to document significant differences, given the large variation among individuals, but the trend pointed in a direction that could explain the difference in genotype proportions between so-called "normal" and "lrr-rich" populations.

distinguishing between the selection and gamete pattern hypotheses does not only help us understand how these intriguing all-hybrid populations function; it has consequences for our perception of this and other breeding systems. the selection hypothesis would suggest that the all-hybrid populations of p. esculentus constitute one breeding system with different appearances under different ecological conditions. the gamete pattern hypothesis would suggest that the all-hybrid populations are a mosaic of intrinsically different variants of this breeding system. the latter would, in other words, suggest a breeding system with high biodiversity and various evolutionary significant units.

in this study, we first document the adult genotype frequencies over six years in a sample of  <dig> swedish ponds to investigate whether different temporally stable population types exist. we also determined whether body length increases with r/l dosage effect from llr through lr to lrr, or whether body length is larger in adult triploids  than diploids .

secondly, we test the selection hypothesis in adults by investigating llr-, lr- and lrr-specific survival rates in each of the  <dig> ponds. survival rates were estimated from mark-recapture data, and the effect of genotype, sex, time and season on survival was determined by model selection. since genotype  is not heritable , survival is the only relevant measure of fitness in this system. if selection at the adult stage is responsible for a pond being dominated by one genotype, then the proportion and survival of each genotype in the  <dig> ponds should be positively correlated.

thirdly, we test the selection hypothesis and the gamete pattern hypothesis simultaneously at juvenile stages in a subset of three ponds, i.e. the most extreme llr-rich, lr-rich and lrr-rich ponds. genotype proportions were assessed in a cohort of eggs, tadpoles, metamorphs and one year old froglets from each of the three ponds. if selection is responsible for one genotype being dominant among adults in a certain pond, this genotype is expected to rise in frequency during successive juvenile stages. alternatively, if the gamete pattern is responsible for the adult genotype frequency, the genotype that is dominant among adults is expected to be dominant already in the egg stage.

RESULTS
adult genotype proportions
including recaptures, we caught  <dig> llr, lr and lrr frogs above  <dig> mm in the  <dig> swedish ponds  during two annual catching rounds, 2002- <dig> . among males, there were  <dig> % llr,  <dig> % lr and  <dig> % lrr; among females,  <dig> % llr,  <dig> % lr and  <dig> % lrr. the sex ratio in the sample was  <dig> % males and  <dig> % females, but this might be biased by differential behaviour and sampling effort . in addition, a total of six ll frogs were caught; no rr frogs were encountered. four different individuals  were classified as llrr by dna flow cytometry. excluding the six ll and the seven llrr captures plus  <dig> captures of triploids with uncertain genotypes , the mean sample size per catching round per pond was  <dig>   for males and  <dig>   for females.

no overall seasonal effects were found between catching rounds one and two as tested over all ponds and years . this analysis might not reveal seasonal effects differing among ponds or years, but a detailed visual inspection of increases and decreases between catching rounds one and two revealed no patterns. in the following analyses, the first and second catching rounds were therefore pooled or used as replicates.

the genotype proportions obtained in the  <dig> swedish ponds over the six years are illustrated in figure 3a. the two annual catching rounds were pooled to increase the sample sizes, which thus became mean  <dig>   for males and mean  <dig>   for females. as expected , lrr were rare among males, which is the main reason for the clear difference between male and female genotype proportions. by providing examples of 95% confidence intervals for similar sample sizes, figure 3b suggests that most of the year-to-year variation observed within ponds and sex is due to sampling stochasticity. from inspection of figure 3a it is evident that ponds  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were the most different ponds with non-overlapping genotype distributions for both sexes.

glm  analyses of genotype frequency on year and pond  showed a highly significant effect of pond for all genotypes . the effect of year was smaller, but nevertheless highly significant for most genotypes, especially lr and lrr females. in addition, the interaction of pond and year was significant for half of the genotypes.

* stars indicate  <dig> *,  <dig> ** and  <dig> *** significance levels after bonferroni-correction: α <dig> =  <dig> *,  <dig> ** and  <dig> ***. res. dev = residual deviance.

the mean difference in genotype composition among catching rounds, as measured by their distance in a ternary plot, was smallest between catching rounds from the same year . for males, the differences peaked or stabilized after three years, whereas for females the genotype differences continued to increase with time. as the pairwise means are not independent, the trends of figure  <dig> cannot be tested by correlation or regression. instead, a mantel test with permutation would be needed. however, mantel test programmes do usually not take missing values, and the present data set had many missing values, because between-pond comparisons would have been meaningless.

the year effect in lr and lrr females  and the increasing female genotype composition differences over time  both reflect the fact that the proportion of lr females increased during the study period at the expense of lrr females . inspection of figure  <dig> also reveals that only pond  <dig> did not show a net increase in lr females between  <dig> and  <dig> 

adult body lengths
adult body length was measured in  <dig> frogs and differed highly significantly between sexes, genotypes, ponds and all their interactions . mean length increased in the order mllr, mlr, mlrr, fllr, flr, flrr with means ± s.d. of  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm, respectively. thus, males were smaller than females, as is usual in anurans, and clearly llr < lr < lrr within sexes, indicating genome dosage effect. the means cover large variation within sexes and genotypes, as the frogs grow throughout their life.

adult survival and the selection hypothesis
of the  <dig> adult llr, lr and lrr frogs caught over the six years,  <dig>  were recaptures. ninety  of the captured individuals  were killed by us by accident or for crossing experiments. these were coded accordingly in the mark input file, so that their removal did not affect the survival estimates. a total of  <dig> % of the previously toe-cut, recaptured frogs had lost their transponder. only in ponds  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were lrr males sufficiently frequent to include recaptured individuals; from the remaining ponds, lrr males had to be excluded from the data set.

for testing the selection hypothesis in adults, adult survival rates  were estimated in comack-jolly-seber mark recapture models. goodness of fit tests  showed no overdispersion . only pond  <dig> was significant for transience ; no ponds were significant for trap-dependence. the data were thus in fairly good accordance with the assumptions of the comack-jolly-seber model.

twelve combinations of the parameters genotype, sex, time and season  were used to model both recapture probability  and survival . for recapture probability, eight ponds had just one best model whereas four ponds had two good models with similar fits . all ponds had a clear distinction in Δaicc between the best one or two models and the poorer models. overall, time was the most important parameter for recapture probability, as six of the  <dig> ponds had time as their best model . this reflects that sample sizes often differed over time. season, genotype and/or sex were of highest importance in the remaining six ponds, indicating that although these factors might not have high general importance, they sometimes had high local importance. combinations of time and other factors were not favoured. this was not surprising, since time was highly parameterized, and aic model selection favours models that fit the data well with few parameters.

for survival, the combination of genotype, sex and time gave the best fit in eight of the  <dig> ponds . for two ponds  this highly parametized model did not converge and, instead, the constant model was favoured. for only two ponds  the model with genotype, sex and time was clearly rejected; instead, models with season and constant survival, respectively, gave the best fits.

adult yearly survival estimates averaged  <dig>  over all  <dig> swedish ponds, ranging from  <dig>  in pond  <dig> to  <dig>  in pond  <dig> . this average translated into a mean life span of less than  <dig> months as adults   <cit> ). however, survival varied among genotypes, sexes and ponds and the ponds varied with respect to which genotypes and sex had the higher survival.

 <dig> mean of pond means; not of genotype means.

with ponds as replicates, there were no significant correlations between the mean proportion of a genotype  and its estimated relative  survival rate over the six year period . the study did thus not provide evidence for the survival hypothesis which predicts that differences in survival among genotypes produce the differences in adult genotype composition observed among ponds.

offspring genotype proportions and both hypotheses
the genotype distribution of the offspring sampled is shown in figure  <dig>  a glm was fitted for each genotype, llr, lr and lrr . two of the three glms were significant for pond , but there was neither significance for stage nor for the interaction between pond and stage .

inspection of the regression parameters showed that in the llr model, the intercept for pond  <dig> was almost significantly higher than that for pond  <dig> , and in the lrr model, the intercept for pond  <dig> was significantly higher than that for pond  <dig> . the remaining four intercepts and all six slopes did not differ significantly within genotypes between ponds . as positive differences in slopes would support the selection hypothesis and positive differences in intercepts would support the gamete pattern hypothesis , this analysis thus provided no support for the selection hypothesis and only very weak support for the gamete pattern hypothesis. the offspring study had relatively low discriminative power because the genotype proportions in one year-olds only incompletely matched the mean genotype proportions of adults.

discussion
the present study is the first to thoroughly investigate the temporal stability of all-hybrid populations consisting of llr, lr and lrr frogs. genotype proportions varied more among ponds than among years. thus, especially ponds with extreme adult genotype proportions retained their differences over the six-year study period. the largest temporal change was an increase in lr females that occurred in most ponds in parallel, thus not diminishing pond differences. systematic seasonal changes were absent.

the genotype composition differences among ponds could not be attributed to pond-specific selection regimes , neither in adults nor offspring. the alternative gamete pattern hypothesis was not investigated in adults in the present study, whereas the offspring study provided only very weak support for it. in the following, we will first discuss the data on body size, sex ratio and survival obtained in the present study and estimate how many generations the study period spanned. then we will discuss problems of distinguishing between the selection and gamete pattern hypotheses, identify potential advantages and disadvantages of differential selection for the all-hybrid populations and, finally, briefly review the water frog literature on this topic.

body size, sex ratio, survival and generation time
as adult body size constitutes an important phenotypic difference between p. lessonae and p. ridibundus with ecological implications, knowing the relative body sizes of llr, lr and lrr can be of importance for predicting their fitness in different habitats. in the present study, a dosage effect pattern was observed among adults so that llr < lr < lrr within both sexes, in line with p. lessonae being smaller and p. ridibundus being larger than p. esculentus e.g.  <cit> . thus, although triploid frogs have larger cells  <cit> , adult triploid llr frogs were not larger than diploid lr frogs. this is in line with the general observation that in vertebrates polyploidy does not imply increased body size  <cit> . thus, although most triploids start life larger than diploids because they usually derive from larger, diploid eggs  <cit> , this initial difference disappears. dosage effect also applies to other phenotypic features, such as the metatarsal tubercle  size and tibia length  <cit> . the callus internus is important for digging in the partially terrestrial p. lessonae, while leg length is more important in the more aquatic p. ridibundus  <cit> . in phenotypic and ecologic contexts, llr and lrr are thus more different from each other than from lr, so that summarizing them as "triploids" is not informative in these contexts.

the sex ratio in p. esculentus is of interest because the two sexes are not expected to be produced in equal numbers . however, empirical data on sex ratio are difficult to obtain because the observed sex ratio in field samples could have been influenced by the differential distribution of the two sexes within ponds at different times of the year and males being easier to catch from mid may to late june when they call. thus, samples were thought to be consistently male-biased in a study of hotz et al.  <cit> . in contrast, the present attempt to catch at least  <dig> of each sex should have led to overestimation of the rarer sex, which was males. the overall  <dig> % females found in the present study among adults is thus an underestimate. offspring sex ratios should be less prone to sampling bias, as sex-specific behaviour is not expected in eggs, tadpoles and metamorphs, and the sexes could not be distinguished during catching . furthermore, offspring sex ratios should closely reflect initial sex ratio. the  <dig> % females encountered among offspring with hybrid genotypes and sexed in the present study may thus represent the best estimate of sex ratio in this system so far. this figure fairly well matches results from modelling all-hybrid populations based on gamete production by the various genotypes predicting  <dig> % females . also in the much more widespread l-e system , p. esculentus have an expected  <cit>  and observed  female-biased sex ratio. in the l-e system, p. esculentus is usually only diploid lr and always make clonal r gametes. as a consequence, the hybrids are dependent on mating with a p. lessonae to produce new hybrids. in an organism like p. esculentus where few males are needed to satisfy the mating requirements of many females, female bias has the advantage of reducing the two-fold cost of sex experienced by normal sexual species.

the mean survival of  <dig>  per year found for p. esculentus in this study appears rather low compared to  <dig>   and  <dig> - <dig>   for swiss l-e system p. esculentus. both studies also analyzed mark-recapture studies with the mark programme, but the latter also modelled migration, increasing the survival estimates. survivals around  <dig>  have, however, also been reported from tree frogs in southern germany and switzerland  <cit> .

for interpreting the results on temporal stability, it is relevant how many generations the six year study period spanned. in scandinavia, males are sexually mature when two to three years old, whereas females usually need three years to mature  <cit> . a rough average would be  <dig>  years. the mean adult life span was here estimated to  <dig> months =  <dig>  years, so the midpoint of the reproductive period should be around  <dig>  +  <dig> * <dig>  =  <dig>  years. this might be a low estimate of generation time, as female fecundity increases with body length, i.e. with age. the six year study period thus probably covered between one and a half and two generations. even longer studies would be needed to investigate long-term development of genotype proportions in all-hybrid populations. however, the general instability of pond habitats may interfere with questions about long-term stability of frog populations.

differential selection
the lack of evidence for the selection hypothesis in the adult survival study can be interpreted in at least two ways. by one interpretation, very small survival differences are sufficient for producing the genotype proportions observed, and thus a larger number of ponds with extreme genotype proportions would be necessary for obtaining a significant correlation. alternatively, pond variation in differential selection on genotypes is not important - at least not at the adult stage. the offspring study was better suited for detecting pond variation in differential selection, because the selection potential is much larger at early stages that exhibit higher mortality. moreover, the offspring study had the advantage of testing both hypotheses simultaneously. the weak outcome was most probably due to methodological difficulties in obtaining representative samples of the various life stages. genotypes might distribute themselves non-randomly in space and time during spawning, larval development, metamorphosis, and/or as one year-olds and adults. our effort to distribute sampling over the entire pond and most of the period where each stage was available might not have sufficed for obtaining random samples.

the reproductive dependence of all genotypes in the all-hybrid populations  upon each other means that differential selection is not required for coexistence of the three genotypes. however, this does not exclude that differential selection could promote differences in genotype proportions among ponds. differential selection could potentially have both advantages and disadvantages for the all-hybrid populations. one advantage is that niche-based coexistence can confer increased carrying capacity  <cit> . on the other hand, differential selection could imply the disadvantage of increased hybrid load in all-hybrid populations with extreme environments. hybrid load should increase because extreme population compositions biased toward one genotype should increase the production of lethal non-hybrid genotypes, unless the gamete pattern is changed. based on these considerations, it cannot be predicted whether differential selection should occur in all-hybrid populations of p. esculentus.

in other water frog breeding systems, various studies have tested one or more of the four hybrid models presented in the introduction. these studies were done in the l-e  system, and one study  <cit>  also included the very similar perezi-grafi system. this latter study found significant habitat differentiation among the three water frog species  and their two hybrids  in support of a mosaic hybrid zone with bounded hybrid superiority, i.e. in support of differential selection. three studies aiming to investigate the relative importance of the frozen niche variation and the general purpose genotype models all concluded that both models may apply  <cit> . finally, one study provided evidence for frozen niche variation by showing that clone mixtures of tadpoles had higher survival than monocultures  <cit> . thus all studies suggest an importance of niche differentiation/differential selection in shaping the composition of hybrid populations, although the frozen niche variation model was not better supported than the non-niche-based general purpose model.

CONCLUSIONS
valuable data on genotype-specific body lengths, adult survival, sex ratios and temporal genotype proportion stability in all-hybrid populations of p. esculentus were obtained. a role of differential selection in shaping genotype proportions was neither identified in the adult, nor in the offspring study. with only weak evidence for alternative processes shaping genotype proportions, the selection hypothesis can, however, not confidently be rejected. in spite of multiple approaches, the importance of differential selection in shaping genotype proportions thus remains an interesting, but largely unsettled, matter in all-hybrid populations as well as in other water frog breeding systems.
