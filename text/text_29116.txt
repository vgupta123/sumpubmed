BACKGROUND
porphyromonas gingivalis is a major pathogen in destructive periodontal diseases including chronic and aggressive periodontitis that are characterized by breakdown of the tooth-supporting tissues  <cit> . p. gingivalis is a black pigmented, often encapsulated, strict anaerobic, gram negative coccobacillus that occurs in the human oral cavity.

among the variety of virulence factors that have been described for p. gingivalis, cps has shown to be a major factor in experimental infections. studies in a mouse infection model have revealed that encapsulated p. gingivalis strains are more virulent than non-encapsulated strains  <cit> . non-encapsulated strains mostly cause non-invasive, localized abscesses whereas encapsulated strains cause invasive, spreading phlegmonous infections after subcutaneous inoculation of experimental animals.

six distinct capsular serotypes have currently been described   <cit>  and a seventh serotype  has been suggested by r. e. schifferle . small differences in virulence have been found between capsular serotypes and strong variation in virulence has been described between strains of the same capsular serotype  <cit> . cps of all serotypes has been tested for induction of immunological responses in macrophages and it has been revealed that the cps of k <dig> serotype strains induces higher chemokine expression in murine peritoneal macrophages than the other serotypes  <cit> . these data suggest that the k <dig> cps plays an important role in host-pathogen interaction. the chemical composition of the k <dig> cps has been studied to a limited extent. it has been reported that the cps of k <dig>  comprises of mannuronic acid , glucuronic acid , galacturonic acid , galactose and n-acetylglucosamine , but the cps structure has not been solved  <cit> .

although cps is a major structure at the interface between the bacterial cell and the host, the exact role of p. gingivalis cps is not yet clear. adhesion to epithelial cells has been shown to be higher for non-encapsulated p. gingivalis and the level and mechanism of co-aggregation has been shown to be cps dependent  <cit> . in many pathogens cps has been found to be involved in evasion of the host immune system by circumvention of phagocytosis, opsonization and complement killing  <cit> .

the aim of this study was to investigate in vitro differences in host response during infection with a wild type and an isogenic non-encapsulated mutant of a naturally encapsulated strain. the well-studied k <dig> serotype w <dig> strain was used as the wild type strain since its cps biosynthesis locus has been described  <cit> . an insertional mutation in pg <dig>  was constructed, which yielded a non-encapsulated strain. the gene has been annotated as a udp-glcnac 2-epimerase.

this epsc mutant is tested in a fibroblast infection model  <cit>  since fibroblasts are the most abundant stromal cells in soft connective tissue of the gingiva  <cit>  and among the first cells encountering periodontal infections by anaerobic bacteria like p. gingivalis. and above all, fibroblasts have been shown to be involved in the immune response in periodontitis  <cit> . human gingival fibroblasts were infected with w <dig> and the epsc mutant and transcription of il-1β, il- <dig> and il- <dig> was determined as host response parameters. this study provides the first direct evidence that p. gingivalis cps reduces the host immune response, thereby potentially enabling evasion of the immune system to sustain successful long-term infection.

RESULTS
epsc mutant construction
after transformation of the linearized plasmid pΔepsc to p. gingivalis w <dig> the epsc insertional mutation was confirmed by specific pcr amplifications and agarose gel electrophoresis of the products . primer combinations epsc bamhi f × pg <dig> r and eryf f × epsc ecori r  ensured that a  <dig>  kb fragment of pΔepsc had been integrated by double crossover at pg <dig>  as expected, replacing the intact copy with the insertionally inactivated copy .

to examine if the mutation had an influence on the growth characteristics of the epsc mutant both w <dig> and the epsc mutant were grown in brain heart infusion broth supplemented with hemin  and menadione  . phase-contrast microscopy revealed that the mutant grows in aggregates, but no difference in growth rate was observed.

epsc mutant characterization
the potential polar effect of the insertional inactivation on the down stream gene of epsc named hup- <dig> was examined. total rna was extracted from w <dig> and the epsc mutant in the early exponential phase and the hup- <dig> expression levels were evaluated by real-time pcr. no significant difference in expression of hup- <dig> was found between w <dig> and the epsc mutant .

to show the effect of capsule-loss on the surface structure of p. gingivalis the hydrophobicity of the epsc mutant was tested by the capacity to adhere to hexadecane. while 3% of w <dig> cells was shown to adhere to hexadecane more than 60% of the epsc mutant cells was adhered to hexadecane. 19% of the complemented mutant cells was adhered to hexadecane .

reactivity with the cps-specific polyclonal rabbit antisera against p. gingivalis serotypes k1-k <dig>  <cit>  was examined for w <dig> and the epsc mutant. the epsc mutant was not recognized by any of the antisera including the k <dig> antiserum, whereas the wild type strain was only recognized by the k <dig> antiserum . differences in cps characteristics were also studied by percoll density gradient centrifugation, which can reveal density differences between encapsulated and non-encapsulted bacteroides strains  <cit> . percoll density gradient centrifugation analyses of w <dig> and the epsc mutant showed that the density of the mutant had been changed . where w <dig> mostly settled at the 20-30% interface, the epsc mutant settled at the 50-60% interface. note that the appearance of w <dig> is diffuse and not restricted to the 20-30% interface. the mutant settles as a compact and granulous layer.

to conclusively examine the absence of cps in the epsc mutant, light microscopy was performed using india ink in combination with fuchsine staining . the negative india ink staining allows direct visualization of the capsule, appearing as a light halo surrounding the p. gingivalis cell. fuchsine is used to stain the cell body. the halos around the w <dig> wild type strain are clearly visible in the phase contrast microscopic picture, whereas halos are absent around the epsc mutant. the intact epsc gene in trans under control of the cp <dig> promoter rescues the wild-type phenotype enabling the complemented mutant to produce a k <dig> capsule again .

fibroblast response to p. gingivalis challenge
to study the effect of the epsc deletion on the host immune response six hour infection studies of human gingival fibroblasts with w <dig> and the epsc mutant were performed. figure  <dig> shows il-1β, il- <dig> and il- <dig> expression of infected gingival fibroblasts relative to the non-infected negative control which is set to  <dig> and normalized against expression of housekeeping gene gapdh.

at multiplicity of infection  1000: <dig> of both strains a small induction of the tested genes could be detected compared to the non-infected control, but significant induction for all three genes was found when moi  <dig> : <dig> was used for infection.at moi 1000: <dig> il- <dig> and il- <dig> expression showed a significantly higher induction  in the cells challenged with the epsc mutant when compared to the wild-type , il-1β did not show a difference compared to the wild-type. however, when gingival fibroblasts were challenged with moi  <dig>  bacteria all three tested genes showed a significantly higher induction in the cells challenged with the epsc mutant than with w <dig> . when fibroblasts were challenged with the complemented mutant the response was almost completely restored to wild-type levels .

sedimentation of the epsc mutant in comparison to w <dig> was analyzed in the same buffer as used in the infection experiments. no significant sedimentation differences were found between w <dig> and the epsc mutant within the  <dig> hours needed for infection of the fibroblasts .

since infections were done with viable p. gingivalis, survival of the bacteria during the 6-hour aerobic period of infection in dmem medium had to be ensured. therefore a 6-hour survival experiment was performed in the 24-well plates used for the fibroblast challenge. on average 60-75% of w <dig>  epsc mutant and complemented mutant cells survived for  <dig> hours in dulbecco's modified eagle's medium  supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum  .

discussion
the aim of this paper was to understand the role of p. gingivalis cps in the response of human gingival fibroblasts.p. gingivalis cps has been regarded as an important virulence factor. it has been shown to induce inflammatory mediators in in vitro studies  <cit> . the capsule also plays an important role in shielding of immune response inducers in several bacterial species  <cit> . since a distinct cps biosynthesis locus in p. gingivalis has been described and shown to be functional  <cit> , studying the role of p. gingivalis cps in the immune response by use of a mutant became feasible. for this purpose an insertional isogenic knockout in epsc, a potential capsular biosynthesis gene within the cps biosynthesis locus present in strains of different serotypes, was constructed to prevent capsule synthesis. the homologue of this gene in listeria monocytogenes lmo <dig> has been shown to be essential for survival, and has been suggested to be involved in the maintenance of cell shape by providing a precursor of the teichoic acid linkage unit that serves as an acceptor for the main teichoic acid chain assembly  <cit> . construction of the p. gingivalis epsc mutant shows that the epsc gene is not essential for p. gingivalis viability.

in the present study the mutant is shown to be non-encapsulated by double immuno-diffusion, density gradient centrifugation and india ink staining. complementation resulted in rescue of wild-type k <dig> capsule biosynthesis. although the exact role of epsc remains to be elucidated, this finding provides evidence that epsc is essential in p. gingivalis cps biosynthesis.

the epsc mutant was expected to have altered immunological properties. to examine the role of cps, both the wild-type and the epsc mutant were used in an in vitro challenge of primary human gingival fibroblasts. since the epsc mutant has altered physical properties, it was important to compare the sedimentation rate and viability of both the wild type and the mutant strain since these could have influenced the amount of living bacterial cells that are in contact with the fibroblasts. no differences were observed between the strains during the  <dig> hours of infection.

from the infection experiments of the gingival fibroblasts it became apparent that pro-inflammatory mediators il-1β, il- <dig> and il- <dig> expression levels were up-regulated after a 6-hour challenge with both wild-type w <dig> and the epsc mutant in comparison to the non-infected control, especially when mois of  <dig> : <dig> were used.

a challenge with the epsc mutant induced a significantly higher pro-inflammatory immune response than a challenge with the wild type w <dig>  as shown by il-1β, il- <dig> and il- <dig> gene expression. so, even though purified p. gingivalis cps has been shown to stimulate pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in murine peritoneal macrophages  <cit>  the absence of capsule induces extra cytokine induction when viable p. gingivalis cells were used to challenge fibroblasts.

capsular polysaccharides of several bacteria have been implicated in down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine production, including klebsiella pneumonia  <cit> . bacteroides fragilis capsular polysaccharide complex has been shown to induce il- <dig> expression, a regulating cytokine which may cause suppression of the immune system  <cit> .

an explanation of our results may be that the cps prevents more potent immune inducers to be recognized by toll-like receptors on the fibroblasts. it has been shown that the capsular antigen in salmonella typhi, referred to as vi-antigen, is able to prevent toll-like receptor  <dig> recognition of lps, thereby reducing expression of pro-inflammatory tnf-α and il- <dig>  <cit> . in e. coli the capsule may cover short  bacterial adhesins, which do not penetrate the  <dig> - <dig>  μm capsular layer, preventing them from being recognized by the immune system  <cit> . likewise, p. gingivalis strain w <dig> was described as to have a small amount of short fimbriae that might be mostly covered by the cps  <cit> .

another or additional explanation of our findings could be immune suppression by p. gingivalis cps, meaning that cps would actively modulate the immune response of the fibroblasts, leading to lower inflammatory cytokine expression levels, potentially enabling p. gingivalis to evade the immune system.

for several bacteria it has been described that capsular biosynthesis can be modulated depending on environmental conditions  <cit> . although presently no regulation of p. gingivalis capsule expression has been described, we can not exclude the possibility that in the in vivo situation capsule expression is regulated. however, the reduced pro-inflammatory host's immune response by the encapsulated strain may explain the documented differences between natural p. gingivalis strains in spreading. whereas non-encapsulated strains are tackled directly by the immune system in localized abscesses, the more virulent encapsulated strains can evade this defence and cause phlegmonous infections  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the epimerase-coding gene epsc of p. gingivalis is essential for cps synthesis. the absence of cps results in increased induction of il-1β, il- <dig> and il- <dig> in human gingival fibroblasts upon in vitro infection with viable p. gingivalis cells. p. gingivalis cps acts as a functional interface between the pathogen and the host. the cps-related reduced pro-inflammatory response can explain why natural non-encapsulated strains cause localized abscesses and encapsulated strains spreading phlegmonous infections.
