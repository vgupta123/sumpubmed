BACKGROUND
microbial pathogens have developed various strategies to escape and alter host immunity to favor their survival within the host  <cit> . intracellular pathogens, in particular, use host cells as a replicating niche, and their release from infected cells with subsequent infection of new cells may contribute to dissemination and persistence of infection.

chlamydia pneumoniae is a gram-negative, obligate intracellular bacterium causing respiratory infections, such as acute pneumonia, bronchitis, and sinusitis  <cit> . furthermore, there is a growing body of evidence for association of persistent c. pneumoniae infections with a range of chronic diseases, such as atherosclerosis, asthma, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, alzheimer’s disease, and osteoporosis  <cit> . chlamydiae exhibit a dimorphic life cycle with extracellular, infectious elementary bodies , and intracellular, non-infectious reticulate bodies   <cit> . transition into a state of persistence can be induced in vitro by factors such as penicillin, starvation, or maturation of the host cell. among the susceptible host cells are the mucosal and vascular endothelium, smooth muscle cells, circulating monocytes, and tissue-specific macrophages  <cit> . c. pneumoniae can induce monocyte inflammatory cascades and modulate cellular lipid metabolism  <cit> . human monocyte cell lines have been shown to transfer the pathogen to endothelial cells in vitro  <cit> , and several lines of evidence propose a role of circulating monocytes as vehicle of its vascular dissemination  <cit> . monocytes may traffic c. pneumoniae across the blood-brain-barrier, shed them in the central nervous system, and induce neuroinflammation  <cit> .

the detection of pathogens within immune cells is challenging, and their intracellular growth may prevent correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment. the value of blood cultures as a general diagnostic tool for pathogen detection is limited due to delayed availability of results and poor sensitivity for fastidious pathogens  <cit> .

here, we established an in vitro model for the infection of immune cells with intracellular pathogens and investigated cytokine and chemokine release from human blood derived monocytes infected with c. pneumoniae. to trace monocyte infection, we applied a combination of methods, namely immunofluorescence and real-time pcr  as well as an oligonucleotide dna microarray for intracellular pathogens. finally, we used raman microspectroscopy to identify infected monocytes based on altered biomolecule fingerprints.

RESULTS
detection of c. pneumoniae by immunofluorescence
c. pneumoniae was grown in hep- <dig> cells, which are established for chlamydia propagation  <cit> . cells were lysed at 72 h post infection, and fractions of chlamydial elementary bodies were isolated and used to infect adherent monocytes. infection was performed using 2 ×  <dig> and 2 ×  <dig> inclusion forming units  per 2 ×  <dig> monocytes, further designated as high and low dose protocols, respectively. mature chlamydial inclusions co-localized with lps in infected hep- <dig> cells, and chlamydial dna could be visualized at 48 h post infection . in contrast to the clearly bordered chlamydial inclusions observed in hep- <dig> cells, chlamydial lps appeared in clusters of vesicles in the cytoplasm of monocytes . reinfection of fresh hep- <dig> cells with lysates derived from infected monocytes revealed no chlamydial inclusions , indicating the absence of viable pathogen. monocyte infection rates as determined by immunofluorescence were 3–9% for the low dose vs. 41–50% for the high dose infection .figure  <dig>

detection of c. pneumoniae by dna-microarray and rt- pcr
two dna-based methods, rt-pcr and a novel dna microarray, were employed to monitor c. pneumoniae infection of monocytes. rt-pcr revealed no significant changes in copy numbers of the intracellular pathogen over time . no chlamydial dna was detected in uninfected monocytes. in contrast, hep- <dig> cells infected with c. pneumoniae exhibited an increase in the copy number of the 16s rdna gene transcripts after 48 h of infection .

an oligonucleotide microarray was developed for the simultaneous detection of bartonella, bordetella, chlamydia and mycoplasma as described in materials and methods. the sequence of the chosen primer pair and oligonucleotide probes are summarized in figure 2a. red spots on the heatmap  indicate strong hybridization of the selected oligonucleotide probes with their complementary pcr products, demonstrating the specificity of the microarray. certain probes, such as chlamydia spp. p <dig> showed weak cross-hybridization to mycoplasma and bordetella. to classify a hybridization pattern, the nearest shrunken centroid classification was used and validated in a leave-out cross-validation approach  <cit> . relying on this analysis, the assay specificity for all  <dig> hybridizations was determined to be 100% at genus level and more than  <dig> % at species level. using this oligonucleotide microarray, dna extracted from monocytes yielded a positive signal at  <dig> and 48 h post infection for the high and low dose protocol, respectively .figure  <dig>

detection of modified biomolecule patterns by raman spectroscopy
we recorded raman spectra for monocytes infected with c. pneumoniae and for uninfected monocytes. the scores plot resulting after principal component analysis  showed two clusters for uninfected and infected monocytes after 48 h, which can be separated on pc <dig> , while no separation was seen after 6 h of infection . data of infected and uninfected cells after 48 h were compared in a mean spectra plot  and certain wave number areas specific for infection were re-analyzed by pca for clear separation . according to this analysis, differences between infected monocytes and uninfected control were found in wavenumber regions 1645–1660 cm− <dig>  1430–1451 cm− <dig>  1327–1356 cm− <dig>  1290–1306 cm− <dig>  and 888–934 cm− <dig>  indicating changes in lipids, fatty acids, and nucleic acids in infected monocytes  <cit> .figure  <dig>

cytokine release from infected monocytes
cytokine release was assessed after monocyte infection with c. pneumoniae . levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha  increased over 6 h after post infection with low dose c. pneumoniae or lps and remained stable or slightly decreased at later time points. high dose c. pneumoniae induced an analogous kinetic pattern of tnf-α release with approximately five-fold higher tnf-α concentrations. secretion of il- <dig> started at 6 h post infection for all stimuli with a continuous increase over 48 h. high dose c. pneumoniae yielded about five-fold higher il- <dig> concentrations as compared to the lower dose.figure  <dig>

while similar levels of tnf-α and il- <dig> were released after infection with low dose c. pneumoniae or stimulation with 1 ng/ml lps, low dose c. pneumoniae induced higher levels of il-1β, il-12p <dig> and il-12p <dig> over time than lps, which was shown to be statistically significant . noteworthy, levels of il-12p <dig> in the supernatant were about ten-fold higher than levels of il-12p <dig>  demonstrating that production of each of the subunits of il- <dig> is independently regulated. the anti-inflammatory mediator il- <dig> started to increase at 6 h post infection for all stimuli, but showed different kinetics for low dose c. pneumoniae and lps. lps yielded significantly higher levels of il- <dig> than low dose c. pneumoniae at 6 h after stimulation, but this ratio was reversed over time, resulting in significantly higher il- <dig> levels for low dose c. pneumoniae as compared to lps after 48 h. cytokine levels released from mock-infected monocytes remained below the detection limit and did not differ from uninfected controls .

chemokine release from infected monocytes
secretion of monocyte chemotactic protein - <dig> and mcp- <dig> started at 24 h after monocyte infection with c. pneumoniae and continued to increase for up to 48 h. lps induced significantly lower amounts of both chemokines over time . macrophage inflammatory protein -1α and mip-1β release started at 6 h after monocyte infection with c. pneumoniae and continued to increase for up to 48 h, while mip- <dig> peaked at 24 h after stimulation with lps and started to decrease thereafter. an analogous pattern was seen for il- <dig> , which increased continuously over 48 h after monocyte infection with c. pneumoniae, while levels peaked at 24 h upon lps stimulation. again, chemokine levels released from mock-infected monocytes remained below the detection limit.figure  <dig>

discussion
monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages are supposed to act as vectors for the systemic dissemination of c. pneumoniae  <cit> . here, we established an in vitro model to study the activation of human blood monocytes with c. pneumoniae and to examine immune mediator profiles secreted by infected monocytes. to detect intracellular pathogen and to analyze the potential ability of monocytes to support chlamydia replication, we applied a combination of rt-pcr and immunofluorescence as well as an oligonucleotide dna microarray for intracellular pathogens. immunofluorescence revealed numerous small vesicles containing clusters of chlamydial lps in the cytoplasm of infected monocytes, but it failed to detect chlamydial dna or typical chlamydial inclusions. hep- <dig> cells, which were used to propagate c. pneumoniae, in contrast, allowed for the formation and growth of inclusions containing chlamydial dna and lps. rt-pcr did not reveal significant changes in copy numbers of the intracellular pathogen over time, which indicates persistence but not replication of internalized c. pneumoniae in monocytes under these experimental conditions. in line with this finding, no viable c. pneumoniae could be recovered in hep- <dig> cells upon re-infection with lysates from monocytes infected with c. pneumoniae for 48 h. this observation is in accordance with previously published data showing that c. pneumoniae does not replicate in freshly isolated monocytes, while monocyte-derived macrophages cultured for several days support the growth of chlamydial progeny  <cit> . consistently, a comparative evaluation of monocyte infection with c. pneumoniae  <cit>  showed a drastically reduced infectivity of c. pneumoniae in human monocytes at  <dig> and 48 h after infection, and no infective c. pneumoniae was detectable at later time points.

complementary to immunofluorescence and rt-pcr, we confirmed the presence of c. pneumoniae in infected monocytes using an oligonucleotide dna microarray for the detection of intracellular pathogens bartonella, bordetella, chlamydia and mycoplasma. dna extracted from monocytes infected with c. pneumoniae yielded a positive signal at  <dig> and 48 h post infection for the high and low dose protocol, suggesting that the prototype dna array has a potential to be developed into a useful diagnostic tool.

as a further method to trace monocyte infection with c. pneumoniae, we assessed the ability of raman microspectroscopy to discriminate between infected monocytes and non-infected cells. raman microspectroscopy, a combination of raman spectroscopy and confocal microscopy, is an emerging technique to study living cells, providing fingerprints of their chemical composition. it has been applied in a recent study to characterize intracellular distribution of metabolites in chlamydia-infected epithelial cells  <cit> . according to our results, this non-invasive technique allows for the discrimination of c. pneumoniae infected and non-infected monocytes, supporting its value to screen for intracellular pathogens. of note, the changes in the wave number regions 1645–1660 cm− <dig>  and 1327–1356 cm− <dig>  in infected monocytes in our study were comparable to data obtained in chlamydial infected epithelial cells  <cit> .

cytokine and chemokine release from infected monocytes were assessed in comparison to mediator release triggered by lps. while several studies have been published on cytokine release by monocytic cell lines infected with c. pneumoniae  <cit> , we used human blood monocytes purified from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells  by negative depletion and adherence to tissue culture plates. while release of tnf-α and il- <dig> did not differ significantly for stimulation with low dose c. pneumoniae and lps, c. pneumoniae induced significantly higher levels of il-1β, il-12p <dig>  and il-12p <dig> than lipopolysaccharide. secretion of il-1β is tightly controlled and requires a first danger signal to produce pro-il-1β and a second intracellular signal to induce caspase- <dig> dependent secretion of mature il-1β  <cit> . due to constitutive activation of caspase- <dig>  monocytes are able to secrete il-1β upon stimulation with single ligands, while this ability is lost after monocyte adhesion  <cit> . consistently, adherent monocytes in our study failed to release significant amounts of il-1β upon stimulation with lps alone, whereas infection with c. pneumoniae, which provides both an extracellular and an intracellular stimulus, resulted in strong induction of il-1β. the same pattern was observed for il- <dig>  confirming that tlr ligands alone are not sufficient to induce production of the il- <dig> heterodimer  <cit> .

infection with c. pneumoniae induced substantial chemokine release from adherent monocytes in our model. mcp- <dig>  mip-1α, and il- <dig> secretion were comparable for low-dose chlamydial infection and stimulation with lps, correlating with similar tnf-α secretion for the two stimuli, adding evidence to the finding that mcp- <dig>  mip-1α and il- <dig> induction depend on tnf-α  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the intracellular pathogen c. pneumoniae could be detected in human blood monocytes using a combination of immunofluorescence and rt-pcr, but we found no evidence for chlamydial replication. in addition, the oligonucleotide dna microarray for the detection of intracellular pathogens as well as raman microspectroscopy provided robust values to track infection of immune cells with intracellular pathogens. infection of human blood monocytes with c. pneumoniae resulted in cytokine and chemokine profiles which differed significantly from stimulation with lps, underscoring the ability of intracellular pathogens to alter innate immune response and to enhance mediator release via simultaneous activation of both membrane-bound and cytosolic pattern recognition receptors.
