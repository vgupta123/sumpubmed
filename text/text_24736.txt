BACKGROUND
ralstonia solanacearum is the causal agent of the destructive bacterial wilt disease in tropical and subtropical crops, including tomato, tobacco, banana, peanut and eggplant  <cit> . r. solanacearum is one of the most aggressive bacterial pathogens infecting potato . the disease in potato is also called brown rot and is endemic in the andean region, where potato is a staple food, causing an important impact on food production, public health and the economy of the region  <cit> . the pathogen is transmitted by soil, water or infected material; it invades the plant through wound sites in the roots and rapidly colonizes the xylem vessels, where it produces large amounts of exopolysaccharides that block water flow causing wilting and eventually plant death  <cit> .

durable resistance against r. solanacearum in cultivated potato or in any of the commercial varieties of other hosts is scarce, rendering the control of bacterial wilt challenging  <cit> . loci or genes for quantitative resistance to bacterial wilt have been recently identified in tobacco  <cit> , tomato  <cit> , eggplant  <cit>  and in the model species medicago truncatula  <cit> . however, there is limited knowledge on the molecular basis of these resistances. the best characterized resistance response to r. solanacearum is mediated by rrs1-r, a single arabidopsis thaliana gene encoding a tir-nbs-lrr protein which is able to recognize the bacterial effector popp <dig> and provide recessive resistance  <cit> .

potato breeding programs have used wild species related to s. tuberosum as a source of resistance against bacterial wilt  <cit> . initially, s. phureja was used to successfully introgress resistance in potato against r. solanacearum  <cit> . nonetheless, this germplasm shows resistance at high altitudes yet becomes susceptible when grown at warmer temperatures in the lowlands  <cit> , suggesting the existence of latent infections . despite this drawback, the use of resistant varieties is an important approach to control the disease. s. commersonii dun  <cit> , native to uruguay, argentina and brazil, has been used as a valuable source of resistance to several diseases including bacterial wilt  <cit> . this wild relative of potato is diploid, and has shown segregation of resistance against bacterial wilt  <cit> . gonzalez et al.  <cit>  obtained a s. commersonii population  that segregated for r. solanacearum resistance, suggesting polygenic control for this trait.

applying transcriptomics to study host-pathogen interactions has provided unparalleled insight into the mechanisms underlying disease development, basal defense, and gene-for-gene resistance. for instance, seminal work on genome-wide expression studies revealed important overlaps in plant gene expression at the early stages of incompatible interactions and the late stages of compatible interactions  <cit> . in potato, microarray studies on resistant and susceptible cultivars have shown that infection with rhizoctonia solani  <cit> , phytophthora infestans  <cit>  and potato virus y  <cit>  induce both general and cultivar-specific defence genes and systemic resistance. in a recent report, transcriptomic comparison of potato varieties resistant or susceptible to the late blight pathogen p. infestans enabled the identification of candidate genes for quantitative resistance to this disease  <cit> . transcriptional responses in leaves associated with bacterial wilt disease development were studied in-depth for the model plant a. thaliana  <cit> . this study showed little impact of the pathogen at the early infection stages and up-regulation of aba, senescence and basal resistance-associated genes during wilting. similarly, the transcriptome of two tomato cultivars with contrasting resistance against r. solanacearum identified pathogenesis-related, hormone signaling and lignin biosynthesis genes induced in stems of the resistant cultivar ls- <dig> while no change in gene expression was detected for the susceptible cultivar ponderosa  <cit> . regarding potato responses to bacterial wilt, a cdna-aflp approach was used to isolate specific transcripts expressed in the aerial parts during resistant and susceptible interactions, revealing metabolites exclusively produced in the resistant genotypes  <cit> . more recently, using s. tuberosum cdna microarrays, the transcriptome of the highly-resistant s. commersonii accession f <dig> was determined in stem tissue  <dig> to  <dig> hours after challenge with r. solanacearum  <cit> . these results suggest a role of both salicylic acid  and ethylene  in the early defense responses  <cit> , but the array technology used did not provide information on any s. commersonii lineage-specific genes that may contribute to resistance against r. solanacearum. as knowledge in plant defense at the root-microbe interface is scarce, we have characterized in this study r. solanacearum-potato interactions by examining the below-ground transcriptome of two additional s. commersonii accessions from the aforementioned cross that show susceptibility  and resistance  to bacterial wilt. we employed sequencing of rnas  to compare the root transcriptome of pre-symptomatic plants colonized by r. solanacearum to that of non-inoculated plants. rna-seq has three important advantages compared to microarray hybridization: it detects all existing transcripts irrespective of gene annotation, it is a direct quantitative measure of gene expression and it is more sensitive to lowly-expressed transcripts  <cit> . we describe for the first time the s. commersonii transcriptome response to r. solanacearum including the identification of candidate genes and novel s. commersonii transcripts that may have a role in resistance in this wild potato species to bacterial wilt. additionally, we compare two different methods to eliminate ribosomal rna to obtain plant-derived mrnas for rna seq.

RESULTS
generating a solanum commersonii reference sequence from rna-seq reads
we chose to analyze s. commersonii transcriptional responses to r. solanacearum in the root tissues, where the infection starts. to this end, we chose to inoculate plants with the highly-aggressive r. solanacearum uy <dig> strain, which was originally isolated from potato  <cit> . root infection is a stochastic process that results in high colonization variability in plants soil-inoculated with r. solanacearum  <cit> . in order to standardize infections, a previously developed light-emitting derivative of the uy <dig> strain  <cit>  was used for plant inoculation and root sections from asymptomatic plants that contained similar bacterial loads were selected after measuring light emission with a luminometer. rna was extracted from inoculated and non-inoculated s. commersonii roots or from a mixture of tissues containing flower, root, stolon, shoot and leaves, and subjected to illumina sequencing after mrna enrichment by polya+ selection or ribosomal rna depletion . the rna-seq reads derived from polya+ selection were used to construct a s. commersonii transcriptome assembly that was maximized to identify novel transcripts derived from the two plant genotypes analyzed . to detect these novel transcripts, rna-seq reads were first mapped to the s. tuberosum group phureja dm genome  <cit>  using tophat  <cit> . aligned reads were discarded and un-aligned reads were retained  and filtered for quality, resulting in  <dig> , <dig> high quality illumina sequences that were used in a de novo transcriptome assembly using the transcriptome assembler oases  <cit> . a total of  <dig> , <dig>  reads were assembled into  <dig>  transcripts including isoforms . possible contaminants in the transcript assemblies were identified and removed by searches against the uniref <dig> database  <cit>  using blastx  <cit> . low complexity sequences  were removed using a custom perl script  <cit>  resulting in  <dig>  high-quality assembled transcripts. statistics including n <dig> contig and average transcript length were calculated ; an n <dig> contig size larger than 1kb and an average transcript length of  <dig> nucleotides indicated a robust assembly of the s. commersonii transcripts.figure  <dig>

solanum commersonii rna-seq was mapped to the s. tuberosum dm genome and s. commersonii lineage specific concatenated transcript sequences using tophat. after mapping, expression values were obtained using cufflinks  <cit> .

a second step in the pipeline involved the identification of orthologues of s. tuberosum group phureja with the s. commersonii transcript assemblies. the s. commersonii transcript assemblies were aligned to the s. tuberosum dm genome  <cit>  using gmap  <cit> ; of these,  <dig>  transcripts  aligned to the dm genome sequence using 80% identity and 80% coverage as thresholds and were discarded as these are close orthologs with gene in the annotated potato reference genome. the un-aligned transcripts  which represent putative novel transcripts in s. commersonii were used for downstream analysis. as the oases algorithm generates isoforms of a locus that represents true alternative isoforms, alleles and paralogues, downstream analyses utilized the “representative” transcript that is the longest isoform of loci with more than one isoform, yielding a total of  <dig>  representative transcripts  <cit> . manual review of the un-aligned transcripts revealed sequences with similarity to proteins from oomycetes, fungi, algae and metagenome projects, suggesting that our initial filtering failed to identify all potential contaminants in the de novo assembly. contaminating rnas may originate from endophytes living in the rhizosphere or present in the unsterilized soil in which the plants had been grown. thus, we implemented two additional filters to identify only high confidence novel s. commersonii transcripts for use in downstream expression profiling experiments. first, using the blast alignments to the uniref <dig> database, the stringency for annotating a transcript as a potential contaminant was lowered and any transcript with a top blast match to a non-viridiplantae sequence  was removed. for transcripts lacking similarity to the uniref <dig> database, we searched the transcripts against the annotated s. tuberosum group phureja proteome  <cit>  and removed any transcript that lacked > 50% identity, > 50% coverage with an e-value of <1e- <dig>  a total of  <dig>  sequences out of the  <dig>  representative transcripts were removed yielding  <dig>  representative transcripts that were stitched together by inserting ns between the representative sequences to generate a set of concatenated transcript sequences .

s. commersonii is a valuable source for potato breeding programs due to its genetic variability and high resistance to bacterial or fungal pathogens as well as abiotic stress including frost tolerance. thus, we classified the newly described genes from the s. commersonii-specific transcript assemblies using gene ontology  slim terms functional categories and compared them to the s. commersonii transcripts with orthologues in the s. tuberosum dm genome. the categories in the s. commersonii lineage-specific transcripts compared to the annotated dm genome  are depicted in figure  <dig>  molecular function categories of genes with an enzymatic activity  were the most represented  in the s. commersonii-specific transcripts vs  <dig> % in the dm potato genome . interestingly, analysis of the annotations of the novel s. commersonii transcripts revealed that nearly 3% corresponded to biotic/abiotic stress response genes and  <dig> % to genes encoding resistance-like proteins. hence, the s. commersonii-specific transcripts, among which, likely lie agronomically valuable genes are described and catalogued for the first time with this work.figure  <dig>

r. solanacearum infection preferentially impacts the s. commersonii-specific genes and triggers stress responses
once we had created a set of s. commersonii-specific transcripts, we analyzed the root transcriptomes in two accessions of this wild potato species that show contrasting resistance towards bacterial wilt. to this end, rna-seq reads were mapped to the s. tuberosum group phureja dm genome  <cit>  and the s. commersonii cts using tophat  <cit>  and expression abundances in fragments per kilobase exon model  per million mapped reads  were calculated using cufflinks  <cit> . inclusion of the s. commersonii cts resulted in mapping of >88% of the reads , clearly improving the efficiency obtained using the dm genome alone as a reference. interestingly,  <dig> genes were present in all root samples within the  <dig> highest expressed , and  <dig> of these genes were also amongst the  <dig> highest expressed genes in samples from other non-inoculated pooled potato tissues . for functional annotation of these genes we used go . in addition to housekeeping genes, the highly expressed genes present in all tissues included metallothioneins, a catalase, late embryogenesis abundant protein  <dig> and a glycine-rich rna binding protein, all involved in stress tolerance. furthermore, the  <dig> highly expressed root-specific genes include drought-induced protein sdi and dehydrin dhn <dig> . the abundance of all of these transcripts in uninfected and unstressed s. commersonii plants may reflect the capacity of this wild potato to cope with different environmental stresses.

differentially expressed genes between treatments were identified using cuffdiff  <cit> . comparison between non-inoculated and pathogen-inoculated roots of the resistant f <dig> genotype revealed  <dig> differentially expressed genes . among these genes, a  <dig> -beta glucosidase, a threonine dehydratase and an unknown protein were induced the highest, while an abc transporter, a cysteine protein, a cytochrome p <dig> and a hsp <dig> were highly repressed after pathogen infection . when inoculated and control roots of the f <dig> susceptible genotype were compared,  <dig> differentially expressed genes were detected. an ethylene-responsive transcription factor, hsp <dig>  heavy metal detoxification, senescence-related and polygalacturonase-encoding genes showed the highest expression levels while genes encoding glycine-rich, non-specific lipid transport and unknown function proteins showed lowest expression after pathogen inoculation . the two accessions were compared  for both non-inoculated and both inoculated roots tissues using the same thresholds as above . the higher transcriptional response in the susceptible accession and the fact that  <dig>  genes showed differential expression between the two inoculated accessions  indicate that these s. commersonii genotypes might have contrasting responses towards r. solanacearum in roots. interestingly, both accessions showed a similar proportion of up- and down-regulated genes after bacterial inoculation , in contrast with the higher number of down-regulated genes detected in leaves of the highly resistant genotype f <dig> in a previous microarray study at earlier times of the interaction  <cit> . altogether, around 2% of all s. commersonii genes were differentially expressed in any of the infected asymptomatic accessions compared to non-inoculated plants. this contrasts with the study by hu and colleagues  <cit> , where no genes were differentially expressed at early stages of the a. thaliana-r. solanacearum interaction. this difference is likely due to the fact that we studied roots, the entry tissue in direct contact with the pathogen, while hu et al.  <cit>  also infected the roots but performed their transcriptome analyses from leaf tissue. differences could also be attributable to the nature of the interactions with r. solanacearum: quantitative resistance in s. commersonii versus the gene-for-gene resistance in a. thaliana.figure  <dig>

we then analyzed the origin of the differentially expressed genes upon bacterial infection. the chromosomal distribution of these genes in the dm genome or the s. commersonii cts is shown in figure  <dig>  exceptuating  <dig> and  <dig> genes that could not be mapped to a specific chromosome in f <dig> and f <dig>  respectively. interestingly,  <dig> % of f <dig> genes up- or down-regulated after inoculation were derived from the s. commersonii cts, in spite of representing only  <dig> % of the genes in this species. over-representation of s. commersonii lineage-specific genes in those differentially expressed was not observed in f <dig>  these data support our hypothesis that the s. commersonii-specific genes may encode critical genes that function to confer pathogen resistance to f <dig> figure  <dig>

to obtain a broader picture on the differences in gene expression dynamics in response to pathogen infection in the susceptible  and resistant  genotypes, we categorized the differentially expressed genes  according to their gene ontology  annotation . there were two categories  that stood out as up-regulated in both genotypes after inoculation with r. solanacearum and one  was clearly under-regulated, in line with the accepted notion that induction of plant defense triggers growth inhibition  <cit> . the category “hormone” was also clearly differentially regulated. we divided this category into genes related to the different phytohormones, which showed that an important number of ethylene-related genes were induced in f <dig> but not in f <dig>  similarly, jasmonic acid -related genes were induced in f <dig> after pathogen challenge, but not in f <dig>  in contrast, sa-related genes were down-regulated in both accessions . all these differential expression changes were much more apparent in f <dig>  suggesting that this susceptible s. commersonii accession is stressed further than the resistant f <dig> upon pathogen challenge. since biotic stress genes were clearly up-regulated in both accessions challenged with r. solanacearum, we compared differentially expressed genes from our rna-seq experiments to previous studies of disease resistance in potato. published transcriptional studies in dm potato defined sets of genes whose expression was specifically triggered by biotic or abiotic stress or by hormone treatment  <cit> . comparison of the expression of the dm-annotated genes from our study with those reported in  <cit> , revealed that there is an overlap between s. commersonii genes differentially expressed upon r. solanacearum inoculation and those of s. tuberosum challenged with p. infestans or phytohormone analogues . precisely,  <dig> % of the f <dig> and  <dig> % of the f <dig> genes differentially expressed have been previously identified as responsive to biotic stresses. also, roughly 10% of the r. solanacearum-response genes in both accessions were known as affected by abiotic stresses  or hormone treatment   <cit> . in summary, we found substantial overlap of our results with genes involved in pathogen and other stress responses , suggesting that potatoes use a common set of genes to cope with biotic and abiotic stresses. this also supports the emerging hypothesis that common response nodes exist in plants to face alterations in their homeostasis.figure  <dig>

a set of core genes involved in plant defense are up-regulated after pathogen inoculation in the susceptible and resistant s. commersonii genotypes
we next analyzed the commonalities and differences in the transcriptome of the susceptible  and resistant  s. commersonii accessions upon inoculation with r. solanacearum . a total of  <dig> genes were up-regulated in both accessions  and six were down-regulated . these genes can be considered indicators of the pre-symptomatic responses of s. commersonii to bacterial wilt. their expression is indicated in tables  <dig> and  <dig> as the logarithm of fpkm in inoculated divided by fpkm in non-inoculated roots ). interestingly,  <dig> of the genes up-regulated in both accessions  had been previously described as involved in plant defense  <cit> .table  <dig>

ten pathogen-response  genes were present in the  <dig> up-regulated in both accessions . four of these genes encoded β- <dig> -glucanases belonging to the pathogenesis-related protein  <dig>  family. these enzymes are assumed to degrade β- <dig> -glucans in the pathogen cell walls to protect the host plant  <cit> . similarly, the up-regulated gene cbp <dig> belongs to the pr <dig> family and has shown both antifungal and β- <dig> -glucanase activities  <cit> . three p <dig> family genes encoding subtilisin-like proteinases were also up-regulated in both interactions. p69b was suggested to respond to sa and bacterial effector-triggered defense in tomato  <cit>  and its expression in tomato is restricted to roots  <cit> , the tissue studied in this work. another serine protease was also induced by r. solanacearum, suggesting that these proteases may be involved in host defense against this pathogen. finally, up-regulated genes also included a potato metallocarboxypeptidase inhibitor , which is induced by ja and aba  <cit> .

four genes whose expression was triggered by the pathogen in both accessions are related to the auxin pathway . the up-regulated gh <dig>  gene encodes an enzyme that conjugates amino acids to indole-3-acetic acid  and was shown to be induced in a. thaliana by pathogen and iaa-amino acid formation  <cit> . this gene, together with gh <dig> , gh <dig> , and the transcript encoding the growth promotion peptide phytosulfokine , were described as positively regulated in auxin-mediated adventitious root initiation  <cit> . iaa-asp, one of gh <dig>  products, also caused disease promotion via regulation of pathogen virulence gene expression  <cit> . likewise, atpsk acts as a negative regulator of pamp-triggered immunity to balance the cost of its activation  <cit> . eight psk members are encoded in the s. tuberosum genome, four of which were activated in bacteria-challenged f <dig> while only one in f <dig>  we also found two up-regulated phosphoglycerate/biphosphoglycerate mutases, which are hypothesized to be involved in glycolysis . however, in soya bean and a. thaliana, this gene is strongly induced by auxin and nematodes and its protein product is detected at the root meristem  <cit> .

eight other r. solanacearum-triggered genes were related to plant defense or cell death . for instance, three up-regulated small heat shock proteins were found. these proteins may play a role in defense similarly to the small heat shock protein rsi <dig>  which contributes to tomato resistance by stabilizing resistance protein i- <dig>  <cit> . tobacco small heat shock protein ntshsp <dig>  also induced by r. solanacearum, caused delayed wilting symptoms and was required for effector-triggered immunity  <cit> . one glutathione s-transferase  was also induced in challenged s. commersonii. gsts use glutathione peroxidase activity to protect cells from oxidative damage in addition to catalyzing gsh conjugation reactions, binding auxin and phenylopropanoid and transporting anthocyanin into the vacuole  <cit> . moreover, it is reported that nbgstu1-silenced plants showed enhanced susceptibility to the pathogen colletotrichum orbiculare  <cit> . finally, an induced gene encoded a stay-green protein, which is involved in metabolism of chlorophyll during senescence development and is required for avrrpm1-triggered hr in a. thaliana  <cit> . two receptor proteins of the fls <dig> and efr family were also present. these receptors are known to be an important component of plant immunity  <cit> . finally, nectarin  <dig>  which has been proposed to function in producing high levels of hydrogen peroxide and protect from microbial infection, was also induced  <cit> .

the above-mentioned genes likely control the core responses of s. commersonii towards the pathogen and may explain the higher tolerance to disease of this wild potato with respect to the cultivated s. tuberosum. an indication of this is that three of the above mentioned genes, encoding metallocarboxypeptidase inhibitor, indol-3-acetic acid-amido synthetase  and a leucine-rich repeat  receptor-like protein kinase, were also found up-regulated in the highly-resistant s. commersonii genotype f <dig> at a very early time of six hours after inoculation with r. solanacearum  <cit> . this suggests the importance of these core genes in r. solanacearum-plant interactions at early and later stages of the infection.

upon pathogen challenge, four genes were up-regulated in the susceptible f <dig> accession and down-regulated in f <dig> . we analyzed these genes, since they might correspond to bacterial wilt susceptibility genes and therefore could be good candidates to engineer potato varieties resistant to this disease. two of these genes  are s. commersonii-specific -not present in the s. tuberosum group phureja dm genome- and belong to the go category fatty acid metabolism/beta-oxidation, involved in the metabolism of the phytohormone ja . 3-ketoacyl-coa thiolase  <dig>  is a key enzyme in ja biosynthesis and its deletion in a. thaliana impaired both ja-mediated resistance to insect and pollen viability  <cit> . hormones are known to play a critical role in the outcome of plant-pathogen interactions. higher levels of ja in the susceptible accession compared to the resistant one might explain the contrasting response against r. solanacearum, as ja is known to antagonize sa signaling, which is necessary for systemic resistance  <cit> . these ja and sa hormone alterations could be specific to potato, as previous studies in a. thaliana showed that r. solanacearum is able to successfully suppress the sa defense pathway  <cit> . the differences in the hormone responses of the two s. commersonii accessions could be due to different genetic backgrounds that cause specific plant responses or to pathogen interactions specific to one accession. in this sense, it is worth mentioning that the sa pathway appeared activated upon infection in a microarray gene expression study using the s. commersonii resistant accession f <dig>  <cit> . finally, the presence of a polygalacturonase within the differentially expressed genes in the two accessions could be speculated to be an outcome of bacterial virulence. bacterial and fungal pathogens secrete such enzymes to promote infection and the plant hosts even generate polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins in response  <cit> . it could be that r. solanacearum hijacks the host enzyme to escape from plant polygalacturonase inhibitors.

an analysis of the genes down-regulated in both accessions or whose transcripts increased in f <dig> and decreased in f <dig> upon inoculation  did not reveal genes known to be related to disease responses, but we believe that these sets of genes  are also a useful source for future research on plant-pathogen interactions.

ribosomal rna depletion as a method to assess differentially expressed genes in bacterial infected plant tissues
ribosomal rna-depleted samples obtained from plants infected with pathogenic bacteria should provide simultaneous information on gene expression from both the plant and the pathogen. thus, one of the goals of this work was to compare two methods for rrna removal before transcriptome analysis using rnaseq: ribosomal rna depletion with ribozero®  and polya+ selection to enrich for mrna. starting from the same total rna samples used above for polya+ selection and rna-seq, we performed ribosomal rna depletion with ribozero®, after which illumina rna-seq libraries were constructed and sequenced. with respect to s. commersonii transcripts, polya+ vs rrna-depleted transcriptomes should only differ in organellar genes that remain in the latter procedure and the fact that we were using root samples -devoid of chloroplasts- should minimize this problem. our first comparisons of transcript expression levels for each condition obtained with both methodologies showed distorted ratios for a number of genes that are most likely organellar in origin, thereby biasing the fpkm ratios of expression abundances obtained from polya+ vs rrna-depleted libraries. thus, we searched the predicted dm proteome and the s. commersonii lineage-specific transcripts using the annotated dm chloroplast and mitochondrial genome sequences  <cit>  and removed genes with high sequence identity and coverage to the organellar genomes. surprisingly, organellar-derived transcripts remained, which upon close examination, had not met our initial identity and coverage cutoff criteria using the annotated dm organellar genes. therefore, we decreased the stringency for identity and coverage cutoffs and broadened our query sequences to include the a. thaliana organelles to further define potato and s. commersonii genes with organellar identity. gene expression comparison  between polya+ vs rrna-depleted samples in a set of libraries is shown in figure  <dig>  transcripts showing aberrant ratios between the two mrna selection methods were curated manually and those likely to encode organellar or bacterial sequences were removed. while we were able to remove the majority of outliers, several genes/transcripts lacked congruency in fpkm values between the two isolation methods, which affected identification of differentially expressed genes. some of these outliers were likely due to still imperfect filtering for organellar genes or to other non-polya+ rnas. thus, we used spearman rank correlation to determine the concordance of expression values in the polya+ vs rrna-depleted samples . indeed, the high degree of concordance between the samples using the spearman rank correlation shows that for the most part, these two methods are comparable . however, the outliers and variation in the lowly expressed genes negatively affect both the pearson correlation coefficient  and identification of differentially expressed genes. these results suggest that the technical issues with organellar and bacterial mrnas that are not removed using rrna depletion will not provide identical results as through conventional polya+ selection, in which contamination from bacterial and organellar mrnas is minimized.figure  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
sequence of the transcriptomes of two accessions of s. commersonii and s. commersonii challenged with r. solanacearum are described for the first time, providing a valuable tool for plant breeding programs. two percent of all s. commersonii genes were differentially expressed after pathogen infection. from these, hormone related genes indicated that both et and ja were induced in the susceptible accession f <dig>  but not in the resistant accession f <dig>  in contrast, sa-related genes were down-regulated in both accessions after pathogen infection. we compared two different methods to remove ribosomal rna from the plant samples: polya+ selection to enrich for mrna vs ribosomal rna depletion using ribozero®, and determined that conventional polya+ selection of mrna minimizes bacterial and organellar contamination when compared to rrna depletion.
