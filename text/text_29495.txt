BACKGROUND
domestication or the unique form of mutualism that develops between a human population and a target animal population has strong selective advantages for both partners  <cit> . livestock domestication started around  <dig> years ago in the fertile crescent, beginning with goats and sheep  <cit> . important traits regarding domestication include behaviour and reproduction as well as dairying  <cit> . milking of the ruminant animals was practiced intensively already over  <dig> years ago  in northwest anatolia. domesticated livestock species have undergone and are constantly under artificial selection. strong directional selection in domestic animals is postulated to have led to selective sweeps in which alleles at loci that underlie selected traits  have decreased or increased markedly in their frequency  <cit> . a recent genome wide analysis of cattle identified detectable signatures of domestication and artificial selection in the cattle genome, but also that the current levels of diversity within breeds are at least as great as within humans  <cit> . however, the effects of domestication and artificial selection are still mostly unknown at the level of nucleotide sequence variation.

accumulating knowledge of the domestic species genomes has enabled mapping of loci affecting key traits under artificial selection in livestock. in cattle, numerous such quantitative trait loci  have been identified. over fifty qtls have been localized to cattle chromosome  <dig> . two interesting candidate genes with potential effects on various agronomically important traits, prolactin receptor  and growth hormone receptor  locate in this chromosome at a distance of  <dig>  mb . an s to n substitution  in the signal peptide of the prlr is linked with protein and fat yield  <cit>  and the substitution f279n in the transmembrane part of the ghr has been suggested to be a quantitative trait nucleotide/causative mutation affecting milk fat and protein percentage  <cit> .

both ghr and prlr belong to the superfamily of class i cytokine receptors, which presumably arose as the result of multiple gene duplications and subsequent divergent evolution. ghr and prlr share a common tertiary structure . they mediate the signals of their ligands, the growth hormone , prolactin  and placental lactogen . the binding of the ligand to the extracellular part induces homo- or heterodimerization of the receptors, followed by intracellular signal transmission by the jak-stat signalling pathway  <cit> . both ghr and prlr are involved in mammary growth and function. the main biological role of the gh is the control of postnatal growth, whereas the additional reported effects of prl include involvement in seasonality, reproduction, behaviour and immunoregulation. amino acid sequence identity between ghr and prlr varies between 30% and 70% depending on the part of the receptor. the greatest similarity of the aa sequences between ghr and prlr is in the extracellular domains. the cytoplasmic domain and especially the well conserved box <dig> is essential for signal transduction.

we have previously examined the ghr cytoplasmic domain sequence in different cattle breeds and artiodactyla species  <cit> , where we observed interesting polymorphism. the aim of this study was to characterize patterns of polymorphism in the corresponding intracellular region of prlr in different artiodactyla species and breeds to enable the comparison of sequence evolution in response to domestication and artificial selection in two evolutionary related and closely located candidate genes.

RESULTS
the sequence analysis of the cytoplasmic domain of the prlr gene revealed interesting variation in wild and domesticated artiodactyla species and subspecies . altogether  <dig> snps were found from the cattle samples. of these six were present in both european and african cattle: one nssnp  and five ssnps . european cattle had two private nssnps  and two private ssnps  while african cattle had two private nssnps  and one private ssnp . the cattle snps were inferred to segregate as  <dig> haplotypes  two of which were shared by european and african cattle . american bison and european bison shared one nssnp . besides that, american bison had one private nssnp . european bison samples were more divergent; they had two private nssnps  and one ssnp . statistically inferred haplotypes for the american bison and european bison are given in figure  <dig>  american bison and european bison share one haplotype, bbi_prlr3/bbo_prlr <dig>  the studied yak samples were monomorphic . sheep samples carried four ssnp  and three nssnp  in exon  <dig>  the e387k position has been fixed to e in the bos lineage and k in the bison lineage.

european cattle breeds are grouped and african cattle breeds are grouped. ns = nssnp, s = ssnp, hd = haplotype diversity, π = nucleotide diversity, θw = watterson's theta estimator, * p <  <dig> , ± per kilobase between sequences, ∞does not include sus_prlrl4_del haplotype

statistical haplotype reconstruction uncovered  <dig> different sheep haplotypes. cloning of one ambiguous sheep individual revealed two unique haplotypes  and these haplotypes were included in further analysis . numbering of the bos and bison, and ovis snps is based on the reference sequence nm_ <dig>  all bos, bison and ovis snps were in hardy-weinberg equilibrium.

from the domestic pig samples we found one ssnp  and eight nssnps . numbering of the pig snps is based on the pig cdna sequence dq <dig>  according to the numbering of previously identified snps  <cit> . all snps were in hardy-weinberg equilibrium. the snps in pig exon  <dig> constitute  <dig> different haplotypes . seven out of nine wild boar individuals were sus_prlr <dig> homozygotes, one individual was sus_prlr <dig> homozygote and one individual had haplotype sus_prlr <dig> and haplotype sus_prlr4-del. sus_prlr4-del haplotype has a three-nucleotide deletion  inducing lack of aa  <dig>  prlr haplotype sequences from the different species have been deposited in genbank  with the accession numbers fj <dig> – fj <dig> and fj <dig> – fj <dig> 

comparison of variation in the ghr and prlr cytoplasmic domains in the species analysed in both studies is presented in table  <dig>  new results from the wild boar and european bison ghr sequencing have been added. all wild boars were monomorphic having the same haplotype in ghr exon  <dig> as domestic pigs  and european bison was shown to have the same ghr exon  <dig> haplotype  as american bison. the most dramatic difference in the variation between ghr and prlr within species is seen in the domestic pig. the complete lack of variation in ghr is contrasted with the high haplotype and nucleotide diversity in the prlr, consisting of mainly nonsynonymous variation.

in the bovinae subfamily prlr and ghr show different features in the two bison species from cattle. the bison species, like pigs, are monomorphic for ghr; but show high level of haplotype diversity in prlr. the african cattle shows equally high levels of diversity at both genes, whereas in european cattle the haplotype and nucleotide diversity is lower at prlr. the yak is monomorphic for both genes. sheep belongs to the same family, bovidae, as bovinae species. sheep has similar number of nssnps in ghr as in prlr; however prlr in all is more polymorphic.

the different indices of neutrality at prlr, tajima's d value, fu and li's d* and f* values are mainly reflecting the same pattern with each other. the d values for african cattle, european bison and domestic pig are positive and for european cattle and sheep negative . only the values for african cattle  deviate statistically significantly from zero. artificially selected populations, like livestock species, do not fulfil the assumptions of random mating and constant population size for the neutrality test, hence positive tajima's d values are likely due to the demographic histories of these species or breeds rather than true balancing selection. considering the known history of zebu-taurine crossbreeding in africa  <cit> , the observed allelic diversity is most likely caused by admixture

a sliding window plot of the nucleotide divergence along prlr exon  <dig> in  <dig> vertebrate species is presented in figure  <dig>  two regions of low nucleotide diversity are evident, one at the beginning and one in the region between  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp from the beginning of the exon  <dig>  all e to k amino acid changes in bovidae  are within  <dig> bp in the second low diversity module and additionally one european bison k to q substitution and two pig substitutions  fall inside this region. we studied the possible impacts of the aa changes for the protein structure with the methods implemented in sift and polyphen programs  <cit> . the substitution e378k found in cattle was predicted to affect protein function by sift analysis . two other snps, e384k in both bison species and v439m in cattle, got sift scores below  <dig>  . this cut-off value has been suggested to provide better sensitivity for detecting deleterious snps  <cit> . e  is a polar, acidic amino acid; k  is a polar and basic amino acid; v  and m  are nonpolar and neutral amino acids.

linkage disequilibrium  analysis revealed that in european cattle only one pairwise snp comparison showed ld . on the other hand, in african cattle seven pairwise snp comparisons were in ld . the same ld pattern was visible in ghr exon  <dig>  <cit> . in sheep one pairwise snp comparison was in ld , in pigs two pairwise snp comparisons showed ld .

a parsimony haplotype network for the subfamily bovinae is presented in figure 5a. most of the common cattle haplotypes differ from the major haplotype bos_prlr <dig> only by one nucleotide. however, there are several deduced intermediate haplotypes that were not seen in this study . the most common haplotype for the african cattle is bos_prlr <dig>  it is absent in european cattle and differs by two nonsynonymous and five synonymous substitutions from the bos_prlr <dig> . thus the bos_prlr <dig> as well as bos_prlr <dig>  bos_prlr <dig>  bos_prlr <dig> and bos_prlr <dig> probably represent zebu haplotypes in our data, reflecting the deep divergence between the taurine and zebu genomes  <cit> . according to the prlr network, the yaks are more closely related to the genus bison than to the genus bos. the most frequent cattle haplotype bos_prlr <dig> and the yak haplotype bosgr_prlr <dig> differ by three nonsynonymous and by seven synonymous substitutions, whereas the yak haplotype differs from the american bison haplotype bbi_prlr <dig> by three nonsynonymous substitutions. the haplotype bbi_prlr <dig> differs by five nonsynonymous and by six synonymous substitutions from the bos_prlr <dig>  sheep haplotypes differ from each other with one or two substitutions, ovis_prlr <dig> being the major sheep haplotype . figure 5c presents the parsimony network from the sus data. substitution g534s is the only polymorphism that occurs twice in the network. the major wild boar haplotype sus_prlr <dig> is separated from the two most diverged domestic pig haplotypes sus_prlr <dig> and sus_prlr <dig> by five nonsynonymous substitutions.

discussion
in this study we demonstrate different patterns of variation in prlr and ghr in ruminants and pigs, suggesting divergent evolution and selection pressures before and after domestication.

the prlr molecular anatomy shows interesting differences from the ghr. the bovinae prlr haplotype network is very different from that of the ghr  <cit> , where differences within european breeds, within african breeds and between european/african breeds were larger than between different species ). the prlr network fits better to the known phylogenetic relationships between species. within cattle breeds, european cattle are lacking major private prlr haplotypes in contrast to the previous ghr study. instead the two major haplotypes, bos_prlr <dig> and bos_prlr <dig> are shared between european and african cattle.

during pig domestication in europe , domesticated progeny of the local european wild boars replaced introduced near eastern domestic pigs  <cit> . according to the coalescent theory the most frequent haplotype in a population level study is the ancestral haplotype  <cit> , on the other hand watterson et al  <cit>  argued that the higher the mutation rate, the less likely it is that the most frequent allele would be the oldest. considering the population history of the pigs, we assume that the major wild boar haplotype sus_prlr <dig>  even though not the most frequent haplotype is a good candidate for being the ancestral haplotype of the european domestic pig. if true, substitutions leading to rest of the domestic pig sus_prlr haplotypes have happened after the domestication, as the haplotypes are derived by a series of consecutive substitutions. the result is similar with the result obtained from the mc1r gene that has an effect on coat colour in pigs  <cit> . mc1r alleles/haplotypes differ by more than one nonsynonymous mutation from the wild-type, implying a long history of strong positive selection for coat colour variants. it is argued that coat colour phenotypes result from direct human selection  <cit> . three domestic pig haplotypes differ from the sus_prlr <dig> by two or more nonsynonymous substitutions, the largest difference being five nonsynonymous substitutions. the rapid accumulation of mutations in the prlr gene in the pig is best explained by human influence. domestication and following selection for agricultural purposes have reduced breed effective population sizes to relatively small numbers. in a population with low ne a larger fraction of slightly deleterious mutations can reach fixation due to less efficient purifying selection  <cit> . this may provide one explanation for the observed polymorphism in prlr. however, the ghr gene is monomorphic in the same pig sample, suggesting different selection pressures .

after domestication the reproduction performance of the pig has increased several folds due to an increase in litters per year and piglets per litter  <cit> . this has been made possible by selection and making the environment more favourable for the sow to allocate resources to more offspring. many studies in pigs have revealed significant association of prlr polymorphisms with different reproduction traits . mouse knockout models of the prlr have confirmed the importance of the prl in reproduction . in addition to reproductive performance, the list of modes of actions of prlr is long  <cit>  and shows considerable change through vertebrate evolution  <cit> .

if a gene has undergone repeated alternating functional adaptation to fulfil one or two, even more, functions, it can lead to accumulation of many amino acid substitutions with slightly little overall change of function. this phenomenon has been called functional switching  <cit>  and could thus explain prlr polymorphism. based on the studies done with the domestic animals , prlr could fulfil the criterion of functional switching. however, the accumulation of mutations in the domestic pig prlr seems too fast to be explained by functional switching alone.

the major role of ghr involves postnatal growth and mammary function. the lack of variation in the ghr signalling domain in pigs and undomesticated ruminants is intriguing. the lack of variation in pigs could be the result of a strong selective sweep that has happened before domestication and has been maintained in domestic pigs. on the other hand, the low diversity in the wild boar may reflect a narrow genetic background of the finnish wild boar population. the possible target  of selection at or close to the ghr exon  <dig> is not known. in contrast, the ghr gene cytoplasmic domain in current cattle breeds harbours lots of interesting persistent polymorphism, indicating its possible importance for cattle being malleable for artificial selection for growth and lactation traits  <cit> .

the prlr gene on the other hand shows contrasting evolution in the studied species, having more substitution polymorphism in pig breeds and bison species than in cattle. functional analysis indicated possible effects for nssnps found in cattle and bison, but didn't reveal any effect on the protein structure for pig nssnps. however, methods defining effects of snps are only predictions, and the combined effects of various nssnps can not be analysed by current statistical methods. no known 3d structure for prlr is available, so more detailed analysis whether the substitution sites are in spatial contact with critical residues remains unknown. functional analysis at the molecular level would be necessary to solve the relevance of the polymorphisms.

domestication is a cumulative process marked by changes on both sides of the mutualistic relationship. long-living animals like cattle respond slower to selection than for example annual crops  <cit> . traits that have been the target of domestication and subsequent selection and the genes that affect them, i.e. so called domestication genes, are of special interest even though the success to identify these genes from livestock has been low  <cit> . genes identified by qtl studies are good candidates for genes important for domestication success  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
qtl candidate genes ghr and prlr have varying roles in growth, lactation and reproduction in domestic species and may have responded differently in different species and breeds within species to different selection pressures. we show here that these genes have different evolutionary history among artiodactyls. most likely both genes have been heavily influenced by artificial selection during and after domestication. we found an unanticipated amount of nonsynonymous variation accumulated or persisted in these genes in artiodactyl species during the short period of domestication  and subsequent artificial selection. the differences between species indicate possible effects of selective sweeps before domestication  or before species divergence , directional  selection  or functional switching .
