BACKGROUND
the genus frankia consists of actinobacteria that form root nodule symbioses with non-leguminous plants wherein they fix n <dig> to ammonia that is assimilated by the plant  <cit> . the genomes of three frankia sp. strains show a complex pattern of deleted, duplicated and hypothetical genes plus many transposable elements suggesting a high degree of plasticity <cit> . despite having 16s rrna sequences that are greater than 97% identical to each other, the strains have genome sizes that range from five to nine mbp in size. their genome sizes reflect the diversity of plants infected  <cit> . hfpcci <dig> , with the smallest genome  of the three, infects plants from one family whereas ean1pec , with the largest genome , infects plants in five families. strain acn14a  has a moderate genome size  and infects plants from two families  <cit> .

the number of transposase open reading frames  in the frankia genomes is not proportional to their sizes, contrary to some models suggesting that larger genomes are likely to contain more mobile genetic elements than smaller genomes  <cit> . initial annotations have indicated that transposase orfs, associated with insertion sequences , are highly duplicated and diverse in strains cci <dig>  and ean <dig> , but less so in strain acn14a .

is elements are mobile genetic elements that lack a selectable marker gene and insert into the genome of a host without the need for extensive dna homology at a target site . most bacterial is elements consist of one, or more, transposase orf that catalyze excision from, and reinsertion into, a genome. they are classified into major families based on amino acid sequence similarity, structure of orfs devoted to transposition or the presence of flanking repeat sequences  <cit> . inverted repeats  are commonly found flanking the transposase orf of is elements, but are notably absent in the is200/is <dig>  <cit>  and is <dig> families  <cit> . irs can contain promoter elements for the flanked orf and serve as targets for the active transposase  <cit> . transposition often creates small direct repeats  beside the ir sequences of the element, which may be used to identify prior insertion points of that element in the genome.

is-associated transposase genes are generally poorly expressed  <cit> . the insertion, excision, or duplication of is elements can cause insertion mutations or lead to genome rearrangements often, but not always, to the detriment of the host  <cit> . point mutations that make is elements hyperactive can be lethal to their host  <cit> . if many iss are maintained within a genome, they may confer a degree of genome plasticity allowing for rapid adaptation to new environments  <cit> .

insertion sequences have also been implicated as causes of large chromosome rearrangements through intra-chromosomal recombination  <cit> . such changes might allow some pathogens to evade or adapt to host defences  <cit> . large numbers of is elements have been shown to induce genome deletions and rearrangements in the pathogens b. pertussis and b. parapertussis  <cit> . similarly, a hostile or changing soil environment could select for microbes that can quickly adapt to new conditions. it is also possible that is elements confer no such selective advantage on their hosts. this study focused on annotated transposase orfs in frankia sp. and the identification of fragmentary is elements present in three strains of frankia sp. their positioning and diversity suggest roles in driving genome size and strain differences that may have contributed to the adaptation of different frankia lineages to their hosts and soils.

RESULTS
classification of is content
a total of  <dig> is-associated transposase orfs have been annotated among the three frankia genomes. frankia alni strain acn has  <dig>  frankia sp. strain cci <dig> has  <dig> and frankia sp. strain ean has  <dig> orfs distributed among  <dig> is families plus several unclassified transposases . this diversity of transposase orfs is the greatest yet found in bacterial genomes as of this time. the  <dig> iss in acn are in nine families plus the unclassified orfs. the  <dig> orfs in cci <dig> are in  <dig> of the  <dig> frankia is families. four paralog groups of transposases in cci <dig> contain orfs that, within each group, have >99% amino acid sequence identity; the largest group contains  <dig> is <dig> transposase orfs that share 100% amino acid identity. these paralog groups reflect probable recent duplication  <cit> . the  <dig> orfs in ean are even more diverse with members in all families with few that are identical. inverted repeats were found flanking  <dig> transposases in ean and  <dig> transposases in cci <dig> .

 <dig> determined from annotationing transposase orfs for ean and cci <dig>  acn transposases were reannotated after the blast search to show is family diversity of transposase orfs, as all transposases were originally annotated as "putative." transposases in ean and cci <dig> were not reannotated.

 <dig> transposase orfs that hit other orfs in ean and cci <dig> but not in acn.

 <dig> transposase orfs that hit other orfs in acn and one of the other two strains, but not in all three frankia strains.

 <dig> the number of transposase orfs in each strain that did not hit any sequence in the nr database with an e-value smaller than 10- <dig>  in all cases this was due to a sequence size of less than  <dig> amino acids.

for identifying transposases from ancient or horizontal transfer  <cit>  we conducted blast searches of the non-redundant  database using the amino acid sequences of all annotated frankia transposases. most of the orfs  hit transposase orfs in at least one other frankia strain . of these,  <dig> orfs had blast hits among all three frankia strains, with  <dig>  of such orfs in strain acn,  <dig>  in cci <dig> and  <dig>  in ean. only  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> orfs limited to acn, cci <dig>  or ean respectively . fifty-five of those orfs hit transposases  in other bacteria but not in the other strains of frankia;  <dig> of those orfs belong to strain ean. a complete listing of the results of the blast searches against the nr database can be found in additional file 1: papersupplemental <dig> xls.

interestingly, the largest shared group was composed of  <dig> transposase sequences in cci <dig> that retrieved sequences in ean . the second largest group was comprised of  <dig> orfs in ean that hit orfs in cci <dig>  making  <dig> total orfs shared by cci <dig> and ean. altogether, more than 67% of all frankia sp. transposases are present in groups shared between strains cci <dig> and ean . the acn genome contains only 9% of the total number of frankia sp. transposases but shares most  of those orfs with the other two strains. eight  transposase orfs in acn are unique to the strain, compared with 38%  of the transposase content of ean. acn also lacks the diversity of is content of the other strains with members of only nine is families. the majority of novel transposase orfs found in strain acn are putative; suggesting that they may be remnant members of other is families. ten of the eleven members of the is <dig> family in strain ean have no external blast hits at the 10- <dig> cut-off value.

in order to screen for transposases that may have been more recently horizontally transferred, we compared transposase orf g+c% to the results of the blast searches. the three frankia genomes have a combined average g+c% of  <dig> %  <cit> , so we considered a g+c% of less than 65% to be significantly below the average. using this cut-off value, we identified  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> transposase orfs that had significantly lower g+c content in strains cci <dig>  acn and ean respectively. members of the is <dig> family that are novel to strain ean make up 39%  of the  <dig> low g+c% transposase orfs identified in its genome. this fact supports the notion that a majority of the is <dig> family transposases were a horizontal acquisition by strain ean. excluding the is <dig> family in strain ean, relatively few strain specific transposase orfs had low g+c percentages. only three other transposases  had a low g+c percentage in addition to no external blast hits. seven of the  <dig> low g+c transposases were identified as being shared by all three strains, with  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> orfs present in strains cci <dig>  acn and ean respectively. all seven orfs were annotated as is <dig> transposases with an average length of  <dig> amino acids.

psi-tblastn analysis of genomes
position specific scoring matrices  were generated for the five major is families found in the original annotation of the three frankia genomes. amino acid sequences of all is <dig>  is <dig>  is <dig>  is <dig> and is <dig> transposases found in the frankia genomes were used to create five separate pssm's for each major family. to reduce potential false positives, only two iterations of the psi-blast algorithm were run against the non-redundant database for each pssm. each pssm was then used in separate tblastn searches against the nucleotide sequence of each genome. the results of these searches uncovered 36%  and 42%  more transposases or their remnants in strains cci <dig> and ean, respectively . only four putative transposase remnants were identified in strain acn.

 <dig> number of original annotated transposase orfs from the five major is families  that were used in the psi-blast.

 <dig> hits that involved a majority of nucleotides that were in between annotated orfs.

 <dig> orfs that were not initially annotated as transposases of the pssm is family but were hits of the psi-blast search. this included orfs that were annotated as putative transposases.

 <dig> hits that were lower than 40% id and/or less than  <dig> bp in length.

several transposase remnants were identified in intergenic regions, including  <dig> fragments in cci <dig> and  <dig> in ean. the remaining putative transposases were previously annotated orfs that were reclassified as transposases by the psi-tblastn search, with  <dig> in ean and  <dig> in cci <dig>  one orf reclassification of note is the reassignment of a family of cytosine-5-methyltransferases as transposases of the is <dig> family in ean . conserved domain feature identification using pre-recorded data on the ncbi site reveals that this family of methyltransferases contains two transposase-associated protein domains and no methyltransferase domains. the presence of transposase protein domains in these orfs supports their reclassification as is <dig> transposases.

due to the stringency of the search, each novel putative transposase was identified by only one pssm; however, some hits from the search gave different nucleotide coordinates for the same putative transposase orf that varied by as much as  <dig> bp. the hit with the highest percent identity to the query sequence was retained in those situations. false positives were identified as sequences having less than  <dig> bp of length plus less than 40% amino acid identity to the query sequence. five false positives were identified in strain ean and six in strain cci <dig>  all originally annotated transposases of the five major is families used in the psi-tblastn search were identified, resulting in no false negatives. altogether, a total of  <dig> transposase orfs plus remnants were identified in acn,  <dig> were identified in cci <dig> and  <dig> in ean. the complete list of reannotated orfs and truncated derivatives can be found in additional file 2: psiblastsupplemental.xls.

identification of large chromosome rearrangements
using the mauve genome alignment program  <cit>  we identified  <dig> and  <dig> large chromosome rearrangements  in strains cci <dig> and ean respectively using acn as the reference . we defined the lcrs as regions greater than  <dig> kb common to all three strains with a maximum of a  <dig> bp gap that were out of order or inverted compared to homologous regions in strain acn. a preliminary grimm  analysis  <cit>  of our original mauve alignment projected that acn had the fewest rearrangement events from the node of the trifurcation .

interestingly, nearly all lcrs in strains cci <dig> and ean occur either near the origin of replication of the chromosome or at its terminus. inversions at the terminus can be explained by recombinase-mediated homologous recombination  <cit> , however, overlays of transposable element density maps on the genomes revealed is clustering near these regions as well, potentially linking terminus inversions to intra-chromosomal recombination of mobile genetic elements . despite evidence of clustering in these regions, identical transposase orfs do not flank any identified lcrs as was found with a large genome inversion mediated by is <dig> in lactococcus lactis  <cit> . chi square analysis of transposase gene content within each defined lcr segment revealed no significant difference from expected numbers of orfs for a region of the same size . this suggests that the lcrs themselves do not serve as hotspots for is element insertion, despite their rearrangement with respect to strain acn. instead, they appear to be relatively stable genomic islands that have simply moved to new loci within each genome.

insertion sequence clustering
previous heuristic analyses of the three frankia genomes found more transposase orfs in regions of each genome lacking synteny with the others  <cit> . in order to analyze these is hotspots, a sliding window was used to count the number of transposase orfs present every  <dig> kb. all transposase positions found in our psi-tblastn search were used in the data sets for each organism, as the data recovered from that analysis most likely indicates recent as well as current positions of is elements in the genomes. to assess statistically the distribution of is elements, we used a probability mass function  derived from the average number of transposases found per window for each genome. that number varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> to  <dig> orfs in acn, cci <dig>  and ean respectively.

strain acn was found to have significant clustering of transposase orfs near  <dig> and  <dig> mb . despite the relatively smaller dataset compared to the other two strains, these clusters in acn represented  <dig> and  <dig> transposases in a  <dig> kb window giving their clustering a greater than 99% confidence. the acn genome also has significant clustering of transposase orfs near the terminus mirroring the heterogeneity of the terminus found in all three genomes.

approximately 57% of all transposase orfs identified in strain cci <dig> are found either near the origin, or between the  <dig> mb to  <dig>  mb region. both of these regions have clusters well above a 95% confidence interval, suggesting that the clusters are not solely due to random insertion. these regions are in proximity to lcrs in the cci <dig> genome, suggesting preferential is insertion around these regions may be linked with frankia genome rearrangement events. again, the terminus of this genome serves as a hotspot of transposase orfs in addition to a large peak near the  <dig>  mb region of the genome closer to the origin. this region of the genome was found to correspond to a potential deletion .

the number of transposase orfs found in the ean genome dwarfs those found in the other two strains; a clear pattern of clustering was found. two major clusters were near and symmetrically oriented around the terminus near  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb. both clusters had a confidence interval greater than 99%, and corresponded to breaks in synteny with the acn genome. the lack of synteny near these clusters suggests that these regions may contain gene duplicates. an increased presence of the top three duplicated gene families in strain ean near these clusters confirms this prediction . the symmetrical appearance of these clusters was striking but their significance remains unknown.

gene deletion in strain cci3
using a similar sliding window analysis, we mapped orfs present in strains ean and acn but deleted in strain cci <dig>  <cit> . a comparison of this map  with the transposase cluster map  revealed a pattern of gene deletion corresponding to some clusters of transposase orfs in the cci <dig> genome. comparing all orfs in these regions revealed a general lack of synteny in all three strains, with a notable reduction of both nucleotides and number of orfs in strain cci <dig> in comparison to ean. three such regions flanked by syntenic lcbs were selected for a more detailed comparison of gene position and content among the three strains . regions a and b have fewer orfs in cci3's genome compared to acn; region c showed an increase in sequence over acn. only two transposase orfs were present in strain acn over all three regions. cci <dig> had  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and ean had  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> transposase orfs in regions a, b and c, respectively.

the termini of acn and ean have the largest clusters of genes deleted in cci3; however, a general lack of synteny among all three strains in this region precluded a neighborhood analysis. in general, the largest significant cluster of transposases from the  <dig> mb to  <dig>  mb region of strain cci <dig> corresponds to regions of gene deletion.

discussion
frankia is content
despite having transposase orf's from thirteen major is families, relatively few are strain-specific in frankia. the presence of diverse and numerous is elements in a genome is often believed to reflect horizontal gene transfer  <cit> . given the different geographic origins of the three strains  <cit>  and the sequence similarity of their transposase orfs, it is unlikely that recent horizontal gene transfer is solely responsible for the proliferation of transposases in strains ean and cci <dig>  instead, it appears that the majority of transposase orfs are descended from ones that were present in a common ancestor that diverged with the emergence of actinorhizal plant families approximately  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . some proliferated or were maintained in lineages leading to strains ean and cci <dig>  but some were lost from the acn lineage. one family of transposases, the is <dig> transposases of ean, and a small subset of is <dig> transposases are clearly horizontally acquired. these  <dig> orfs only comprise ~5% of the total number of transposases annotated. the general lack of novel is elements is further supported by the near absence of unique transposase orfs in acn.

remnant transposases, as detected through the psi-tblastn method, indicate past is activity. the low ratio of annotated is elements to newly discovered fragments in strain acn suggests that is movement was selected against in this lineage. by contrast, the ean genome has at least  <dig> transposase remnants, suggesting that transposition and/or duplication are common and ongoing. transposase orfs are associated with heterogeneity and expansion at the terminus of the ean genome, as compared to the acn genome, as well as the large number of lcrs identified by the mauve alignment. is elements have long been known to facilitate chromosome rearrangements  <cit>  so breaks in synteny near identifiable is clusters are likely due to is-mediated rearrangements. support for such activity outside of observed proximity would require direct observation of chromosome rearrangement.

strain acn
with only  <dig> identifiable transposase orfs in a genome of  <dig> mb, the acn genome has fewer transposases than the other two frankia genomes. given the potentially deleterious nature of is elements  <cit> , one would expect that transposition events would be fixed infrequently in a population. in phylogenetic analyses, cci <dig> and acn are more closely related than either is to ean  <cit> . thus, the presence of nearly identical transposase orfs in strains ean and cci <dig>  but not in acn suggests that the common ancestor of all three strains contained elements from many is families that were retained and duplicated in lineages leading to ean and cci <dig> but lost in acn. all lineages continued to acquire novel iss through horizontal transfer.

genome expansion of strain ean
in contrast to strain acn,  <dig> remnant and  <dig> annotated transposases are found in the ean genome. the transposase orfs identified in this study amount to approximately 3% of the ean genome, and nearly 4% of the total cds. the high numbers of is elements may help strains in the ean lineage adapt quickly to new niches. a similar observation has been made in clinical isolates of enterococcus faecium in which is elements were implicated in developing new subspecies that are better adapted to a hospital environment  <cit> . of the three sequenced strains, members of the ean lineage infect the broadest range of host plant families  <cit> . this broad host range may be enabled by gene duplications, and rearrangements, driven by is element insertion and cointegrate formation. at present,  <dig> pseudogenes have been identified in the finished assembly of the ean genome. similar pseudogene and is element content is found in yersinia pestis, another dynamic genome  <cit> .

is clusters determined by our sliding window analysis may indicate genome instability in certain regions of the ean genome. at least two statistically significant is clusters were identified; one is almost entirely composed of transposases identified by the psi-tblastn search . we also identified regions of the ean genome that have expanded by gene duplication . an increased number of orfs and other nucleotide sequence in regions that are comparatively deleted in strain cci <dig> suggest that such regions in the frankia genomes have been subject to major genome polymorphisms.

genome reduction of strain cci3
the genome of cci <dig> appears to be undergoing genome ratcheting coincident with specialization within a narrow range of plant hosts and soil types  <cit> . is clusters, consisting largely of those present in the common ancestor of the three frankia strains, may have promoted the deletion of large regions around the terminus during homologous recombination . this is evidenced by the paucity of non-transposase gene duplicates in strain cci <dig> compared to strain ean and acn  <cit> , as well as by the presence of  <dig> fragmentary transposases identified by the psi-tblastn analysis. analysis of regions of the cci <dig> genome that have lost orfs with respect to the other two strains has shown a loss of dna in two regions of the genome identified from the sliding window plot . the presence of clusters of transposase orfs in these regions suggest that the is elements were either responsible for the deletion events, or capitalized on the fragility of this hotspot. analysis of the frankia proteome using lc ms/ms has recovered peptide fragments associated with five transposases present in deletion windows a  and b . peptides of nine other transposase present at the terminus of the cci <dig> genome were also identified . given that transposases can have numerous barriers to expression during transcription and translation  <cit> , finding transposase peptides suggests that transposases remain active in the frankia genomes.

most transposase orfs in cci <dig> have homologs in the other strains, so the emergence of a strain of frankia that infects plants from a single family appears to have been accomplished primarily through the activity of native mobile genetic elements. whereas ean enjoys a large host plant family range and a geographically diverse distribution, cci3's original native range incorporates parts of australia and pacific islands  <cit> . without diverse selective pressures, intramolecular recombination may have led to the reduction of the cci <dig> genome and a narrower host range  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in the three sequenced frankia genomes, is proliferation has occurred largely without the recent input of is elements from horizontal gene transfer. clustering of existing transposases in the genomes is statistically significant and corresponds to regions lacking synteny with the other two strains. this finding suggests that such sequences within strains cci <dig> and ean have contributed to genome contraction and gene duplication events respectively. while it may seem contradictory to propose that is elements have catalyzed both expansion and reduction within the frankia genomes, selective pressures in conjunction with environmental niche availability appear to be nudging the genomes in opposite directions.
