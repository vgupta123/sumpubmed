BACKGROUND
post-translational modification of proteins is known to be a critical part of many biological pathways, yet in the mycoplasma species, little is known about the extent of protein modification that occurs. mycoplasmas are wall-less prokaryotes and primarily mucosal pathogens of respiratory or urogenital tracts  <cit> . mycoplasma genitalium has the smallest genome  known for a free-living organism, with its close relative mycoplasma pneumoniae having a larger genome  that contains orthologs of all of the m. genitalium genes plus approximately  <dig> additional genes  <cit> . while only a few occurrences of phosphorylation, lipid modification, and proteolytic processing of proteins in the mycoplasmas have been characterized, rows of multiple spots with the same molecular weights have been observed on 2-d gels  <cit> . this suggests that there are yet to be discovered post-translational modifications, but the mechanisms and targets are generally unknown. since phosphorylation is a common modification in other bacterial species, yet only three confirmed cases have been shown in these mycoplasma species  <cit> , we used proteomic methods to examine the prevalence and targets of phosphorylation in m. genitalium and m. pneumoniae.

bacteria commonly utilize three different phosphorylating systems to modify their proteins  <cit> . the first is an atp/gtp-dependent protein kinase system, which leads to the phosphorylation of serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues. the second type is a 'two-component system', which includes a histidine kinase protein that receives a signal and transmits it to a partner response regulator protein through its phosphorylation. the response-regulator protein in turn transmits the signal to a downstream target. the third is the phosphoenol pyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system . the genomes from m. genitalium and m. pneumoniae encode no known two-component systems  <cit> , which has contributed to a viewpoint that phosphorylation might be less frequent in the mycoplasmas than in bacteria having two-component systems. two phosphorylated proteins previously verified in m. pneumoniae are the cytadherence-associate proteins hmw <dig> and hmw <dig>  phosphorylated at threonine and serine residues in an atp-dependent manner  <cit> . both of them are members of a specialized attachment tip structure at one pole in m. pneumoniae, called the complex terminal organelle. more recently, the phosphocarrier protein hpr  <cit> , a component of the phosphoenol pyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system, was discovered.

we examined the chaps-soluble phosphoproteome of m. genitalium and m. pneumoniae, applying a combination of fluorescence-multiplexed 2-d gel electrophoresis  <cit>  with pro-q diamond staining, 33p labeling detected by autoradiography  <cit> , and maldi-tof-tof mass spectrometry . the pro-q diamond dye is a mass spectrometry compatible small-molecule fluorophore that permits rapid and direct detection of phosphoproteins  <cit>  by binding exclusively to the phosphate groups. since it is a new technology, we verified the pro-q results by comparing them to 33p labeling. we also compared cells in stationary phase versus exponential growth in order to determine the effect that nutrient limitation has on phosphorylation of proteins in the mycoplasmas.

RESULTS
we identified  <dig> distinct proteins that are phosphorylated in the mycoplasmas,  <dig> in m. genitalium and  <dig> in m. pneumoniae, by combining the results of 2d gel electrophoresis analysis of soluble proteins using both the pro-q diamond stain and 33p labeling.

fluorescence-based analysis of phosphoproteins of mycoplasmas
the primary method used to assay phosphorylation in both m. pneumoniae and m. genitalium was the pro-q diamond stain. we used 2d page to separate soluble proteins derived from each of these species at both exponential growth phase and stationary phase, staining the gels using pro-q diamond to detect the phosphorylated fraction then sypro ruby to detect the total protein complement. the computer-generated overlays of the images for m. pneumoniae proteins obtained at stationary phase are shown in figure  <dig>  where the pro-q detected phosphoproteins are shown as blue/white spots and the sypro ruby stained spots are shown in red. the ratio of the pro-q diamond dye signal to the sypro ruby dye signal  was used as an approximate measure of the level of phosphorylation with respect to the amount of each protein in a sample  <cit> . in some cases the strong sypro ruby signal made it difficult to discern the overlaid pro-q signal , so panels b and c of figure  <dig> show the pro-q signal for gels with smaller pi ranges  without a sypro ruby overlay.

combining the results from 2-d gel electrophoresis with ipg gradients of 3– <dig>  4– <dig> and 6– <dig>  approximately  <dig> protein spots  and  <dig> protein spots  were observed with the sypro ruby stain. there were about  <dig> protein spots in each strain reproducibly detected by the pro-q diamond stain, with many of these apparently due to multiple isoforms of the single phosphoproteins. a few protein spots stained intensely with pro-q diamond but not with sypro ruby, which may have resulted from proteins with multiple phosphorylation sites, resulting in high-sensitivity detection by pro-q diamond.

thirty-one of the labeled spots from the m. genitalium gels , and  <dig> spots from m. pneumoniae , were selected for maldi-tof-tof mass spectrometry  identification. six spots from the m. pneumoniae gel, that stained as phosphoproteins by pro-q diamond, were directly identified by correspondence to a previously published 2d proteome map, so mass spectrometry was not performed on these spots  <cit> . to confirm the correspondence mapping, we also determined that the identity of the protein was the same in each case as for the corresponding m. genitalium protein we identified by our own mass spectrometry efforts.

a total of  <dig> distinct proteins were identified between both strains, with an example peptide mass fingerprint-based identification shown in table  <dig>  there were  <dig> distinct phosphoproteins identified in m. genitalium , with eight proteins presenting multiple spots due to different isoforms present. in m. pneumoniae,  <dig> independent proteins were identified by ms and in addition to the six identified based on correspondence to identified spots in the previously published gel . all but two of the analyzed proteins had one or more isoforms with significant  mascot protein identification scores  <cit> . for the two m. pneumoniae spots n <dig> and n <dig> not producing protein identification scores above the significance threshold, we located phosphorylated homologs with significant scores in the m. genitalium gels. of the  <dig> spots analyzed, only spot n <dig> did not produce any mascot identification results. based on its position in a row of spots with the same molecular weight , it may be an isoform of the hypothetical protein  that was identified in these other spots.

the peptide profile of spot g <dig>  treated with trypsin and analyzed by maldi-tof-tof. mascot was used for the database search with msdb version  <dig>  13/ <dig> peptides were matched to b <dig>  pyruvate dehydrogenase e1-beta chain. the peptide sequence ion score corresponds to peptides analyzed and identified by ms/ms sequencing, and peptides without a score  were detected only in the ms data. ion scores of  <dig> or greater are significant. the matched peptide sequences are shown by underline in the sequence below.

a) number of peptides that match the theoretical digest of the primary protein identified. the number in parentheses is the count of potentially phosphorylated peptides found by mascot and findmod .

b) combined score for the peptide mass fingerprint including both ms and ms/ms peptide matches for the spectrum. scores of  <dig> or greater were considered significant .

c) identified proteins detected by labeling with 33p-phosphoric acid.

d) spot g <dig> was identified to contain both l-lactate dehydrogenase and ribosomal protein s <dig>  the ms & ms/ms score shown here belongs to the l-lactate dehydrogenase.

a) number of peptides that match the theoretical digest of the primary protein identified. the number in parentheses is the count of potentially phosphorylated peptides found by mascot and findmod .

b) combined score for the peptide mass fingerprint including both ms and ms/ms peptide matches for the spectrum. scores of  <dig> or greater were considered significant .

c) protein spots n <dig>  n <dig>  n <dig>  and n23~ n <dig> were identified by previous existing proteome maps  <cit> ; "-" means that ms analysis was not performed for these spots. the ms data for n <dig> was of insufficient quality for identification.

the  <dig> phosphorylated proteins detected in m. genitalium represent about five percent of the  <dig> m. genitalium orfs  <cit> , whereas the  <dig> identified in m. pneumoniae represent about three percent of the  <dig> predicted m. pneumoniae orfs. however, since not all expressed proteins were observed in the gels, this is likely an underestimate. also, since the m. pneumoniae strain we used is attenuated and lacks p <dig> and p <dig>  the phosphorylation patterns might be altered from wild-type. a more realistic number might be obtained from the ratio of phosphoproteins observed to total proteins observed on the gels, which is 9%  for m. genitalium and 6%  for m. pneumoniae. for comparison, e. coli has over  <dig> phosphoproteins, which is about three percent of its annotated orfs  <cit> , and corynebacterium glutamicum also has three percent of its cytoplasmic proteins phosphorylated  <cit> . although the mechanisms of and targets for phosphorylation are different between these species, the ratio of proteins phosphorylated is quite consistent, adding evidence that regardless of bacterial species, protein phosphorylation plays an important signaling role in the cell.

twenty-two of the phosphoproteins we identified had not been previously reported in the mycoplasmas. there were eight phosphoproteins that occurred in only one of the strains , six from m. genitalium and two from m. pneumoniae. since m. pneumoniae contains a strict superset of orthologs to m. genitalium  <cit> , a case such as mpn <dig>  only detected in the former  is not surprising  <cit> . for the other phosphoproteins only detected in one strain, it is possible that the ortholog in the other species is also phosphorylated, but that we did not detect it.

a) the variation of the pro-q diamond dye signals /sypro ruby dye  signals between bacteria in stationary phase versus exponential growth phase. "↑" means the phosphorylation level was enhanced in stationary phase, "↓" means the phosphorylation level decreased in stationary phase, and "-"means no significant change was observed.

b) "y" means the phosphoprotein was detected in both m. genitalium and m. pneumoniae; "n" means the corresponding protein was not identified in both strains.

c) "+" means the detected phosphoprotein was part of a triton-x <dig> insoluble fraction putatively associated with the cytoskeleton-like structure as reported in  <cit> , and "x" means it was not.

we also examined the ms analyzed peptides matched by mascot and findmod, and in all but six of the identified proteins, at least one peptide mass was found that matches a predicted phosphopeptide for the protein . most of these corresponded with low-intensity peaks, as is typically the case for phosphopeptides due to poor ionization efficiency in the presence of phosphoryl groups  <cit> .

comparison of pro-q fluorescence detection with in vivo radiolabeling
pro-q diamond is a relatively new method for rapid and global protein phosphorylation analysis in gels  <cit> , which may overcome some of the challenges with 33p labeling or immunodetection with antibodies, such as cross-reactivity in immunodetection and the difficulty of obtaining the right growth conditions for radiolabeling  <cit> . because of limited reports of its use in the literature, we used 33p to perform m. genitalium in vivo radiolabeling of phosphoproteins for comparison with and verification of the pro-q diamond stain results. the generation time of m. genitalium is generally 12– <dig> h, so for the radiolabeling experiments we incubated  <dig> h for full uptake of 33p by cells. figure 2b shows the pro-q diamond stained control sample grown under identical conditions, and figure 2c shows the radioactive phosphoproteins detected by scanning the dried gel after exposure to storage phosphor screen  for  <dig> days. we found approximately  <dig> protein spots by each of the two methods, and most of the spots are well matched between the two detection methods. however, spots g <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig> and g <dig> were seen only on the radiolabelled gels, and spot g <dig> was stained by pro-q diamond but not observed by radiolabelling. possible reasons for the differences in detection include:  insufficient accessibility to the site of phosphorylation in some proteins for the pro-q diamond dye, for example due to a steric hindrance effect;  the presence of phospho-enzyme intermediates that can only be detected by metabolic radiolabeling, for example when phosphoglucomutase forms phosphoseryl enzyme intermediates during the catalytic cycle  <cit>  they are detected by radiolabeling but not immunostaining  <cit> ;  in vivo isotope labeling may alter cell cycle progression and morphology, potentially influencing the modification state of proteins  <cit> . despite these few differences, the >  <dig> % agreement between the methods indicates that pro-q diamond dye is accurate for detection of phosphoproteins, and has the advantage of speed and simplicity. most importantly, the radiolabelling adds supporting evidence for phosphorylation of most of our reported phosphoproteins.

biological categorization of identified phosphoproteins
we functionally categorized the identified phosphoproteins using regula et al.  <cit>  and cogs  <cit>  as guides, as shown in table  <dig>  phosphoproteins we identified are involved in energy metabolism, carbohydrate transport, carbohydrate metabolism, translation, transcription, heat shock response/chaperoning, cytadherence, and other unknown functions. interestingly, fourteen of our identified phosphoproteins had previously been associated with the cytoskeleton-like structure in m. pneumoniae  <cit> . these proteins include pyruvate dehydrogenase e <dig> alpha and beta chains, elongation factor tu, heat shock protein groel, dnak, cytadherence accessory proteins, trigger factor, osmotic inducible protein-c-like family and hypothetical protein h10_orf 220l.

several proteins we identified were previously shown as phosphorylated in other prokaryotic cells, including phosphopyruvate hydratase , atp synthase, and rna polymerase  <cit> . ribosomal protein s <dig> was identified as a phosphoprotein in both strains , though it co-separated with a phosphorylated isoform of l-lactate dehydrogenase in m. genitalium, causing concern that the phosphorylation could be on the latter protein. however, in m. pneumoniae, these two spots were resolved separately, and the s <dig> spot remained stained by pro-q diamond. though s <dig> has not previously been reported as phosphorylated, there is some precedent for ribosomal protein phosphorylation, with s <dig> being phosphorylated in e. coli  <cit> . also, the netphos www server <cit>  predicted  <dig> strong phosphorylation sites on s <dig>  one of which matched a detected maldi peak corresponding to the putative phosphopeptide "enlmlsr", where there was a high score for predicted phosphorylation on the serine residue .

estimated phosphorylation levels in different growth states
as cells enter the stationary growth phase, nutrients become depleted and inter-cellular competition is increased. in e. coli and thiobacillus ferrooxidans, phosphorylation of the heat shock proteins dnak and groel was shown to be modulated by environmental stresses including temperature, nutrient starvation and ph change  <cit> . to determine whether there was a similar effect upon phosphorylation in the mycoplasmas, we compared protein abundances for samples obtained during stationary growth phase to those from cells harvested at exponential growth phase by comparing the pro-q diamond  to sypro ruby  ratio between growth conditions . while there was an expected reduction in overall protein synthesis for stationary phase growth  <cit> , the phosphoproteins dnak, groel , elongation factor tu and the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex were up-regulated in both species. in addition, putative structural protein mpn <dig>  heat shock protein dnak, groel, p <dig> , elongation factor tu and pyruvate dehydrogenase all appeared to have increased phosphorylation levels during stationary phase. the phosphorylation level of hmw <dig> in both m. genitalium and m. pneumoniae  was slightly reduced during stationary growth, as were the restriction modification enzyme ecod and the dna-directed rna polymerase delta subunit. the increase in phosphorylation during stationary phase for mycoplasmas involves some of the same proteins as the response in e. coli , pointing at a role for these proteins in stress sensing and response.

protein phosphorylation in mycoplasma cytadherence and cytoskeleton-like proteins
both m. pneumoniae and m. genitalium have a complex terminal organelle structure that enables them to adhere to a host cell for colonization and nutrient acquisition  <cit> . the terminal organelle is a membrane-bound extension of the cell, characterized by an electron-dense core comprised of rod-like structures oriented laterally within the tip  <cit> , and thin fibrous structures extending into the cell body. the proteins p <dig>  hmw <dig>  hmw <dig>  hmw <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> were found to be localized to the complex terminal organelle by a variety of techniques such as immunofluorescence microscopy  <cit> , with p <dig> playing a major receptor-binding role in m. pneumoniae  <cit> , and the others also shown necessary for cytadherence  <cit> . of these cytadherence proteins, hmw <dig> and hmw <dig> were found to be phosphorylated, and there was weaker evidence that p <dig> may also be phosphorylated  <cit> . we found two more cytadherence proteins phosphorylated in both species studied, hmw <dig> , and p <dig> . adding these to the previous identifications, at least four out of the eight cytadherence-critical proteins appear to be phosphorylated, indicating an important role for phosphorylation in the process of host-cell attachment.

we did not detect hmw <dig>  hmw <dig>  p <dig>  and p40/p <dig>  corroborating a previous report that these proteins were not found when ief was used for separation in the first dimension. in previous studies, hmw <dig>  <cit>  and p40/p <dig>  <cit>  were found using nephge  instead of ief for the first dimension. and hmw <dig> , which has the tendency to form multimeric complexes, has only been identified using a 1-d polyacrylamide gel  <cit> . a faint signal was detected in the sypro ruby stain for p <dig> indicating its presence in the gel, but it was not detected by pro-q diamond or radiolabeling, giving no evidence for its phosphorylation, unlike the previous report. the recently reported phosphoprotein hpr, was also not detected. it was previously reported that this protein was phosphorylated in the presence of glycerol  <cit> , so our culture medium may not have promoted its phosphorylation.

these cytadherence-related proteins, except p <dig>  were also detected in a study of the triton x- <dig> insoluble protein fraction from m. pneumoniae  <cit> . as in eukaryotic cells  <cit> , it is thought that the triton x- <dig> insoluble proteins comprise cytoskeleton-like structural elements, of which the complex terminal organelle is a part. we found a number of the other reported triton x- <dig> insoluble mycoplasma proteins to be phosphorylated, including pyruvate dehydrogenase e <dig>  elongation factor tu, heat shock proteins dnak and groel. of the  <dig> phosphorylated proteins identified in our study, fourteen  were reported as triton x- <dig> insoluble.

further supporting these associations with cytadherence and a cytoskeleton-like structure, it was previously demonstrated that elongation factor tu and pyruvate dehydrogenase e <dig> beta are expressed on the m. pneumoniae cell surface and involved in binding to eukaryotic cell surfaces  <cit> . in e. coli, ef-tu functions as a translation/transcription protein, but it has also been observed to polymerize to form filaments and bundles with actin-like properties  <cit> , indicating that it is likely to play more than one role in bacteria. dnak, groel, enolase and elongation factor ef-tu have been reported as phosphorylated in corynebacterium glutamicum, thiobacillus ferrooxidans and e. coli, respectively  <cit> .

we also found a high molecular weight  putative structural protein to be phosphorylated in m. pneumoniae, mpn <dig> , along with a homologous protein , mg <dig> , in m. genitalium. this protein was found in the triton x- <dig> insoluble fraction, and has been annotated as "coiled coil putative structural protein involved in cytoskeleton" like hmw <dig>  which is typical of filamentous domains of known cytoskeletal proteins  <cit> . according to a protein motif scan by "myhit"  <cit> , these proteins contain several leucine zipper motifs as is the case in hmw <dig>  providing potential for dimerization interactions. given all the evidence, it appears that this protein may be important in the formation of a cytoskeleton-like structure.

the combination of previous results and our own indicate that a significant fraction of the mycoplasma cytadherence and cytoskeleton-like proteins are phosphorylated. this may be analogous to eukaryotic cells where phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of cytoskeletal elements has been associated with changes in cell morphology  <cit> .

in the studies by seto and miyata  <cit>  as well as kenri et al.  <cit> , the locations of the proteins correlated with cytadherence in m. pneumoniae were determined. the electron-dense core in the attachment organelle of m. pneumoniae is thought to be the same as a rod-like structure comprised of cytadherence-related proteins  that was observed in mycoplasma cells treated with detergent  <cit> . the wheel-like structure resembles a flagellar motor, and may be connected to the filamentous network extending into the cytoplasm of m. pneumoniae cells. while the composition of the filamentous network  <cit>  is not definitively known, several of the proteins identified as phosphorylated in this study show evidence of being involved in the formation of filamentous bundles, including ef-tu, dnak, and pyruvate dehydrogenase <cit> .

we combined these lines of evidence into figure  <dig>  representing the prevailing hypotheses and data regarding the cystoskeleton-like structural elements in the mycoplasmas, with the phosphorylation data overlaid. while the figure is speculative due to the fact that the cellular location of the elements represented have not all been definitively pinpointed, there is a strong overall trend apparent in the association of phosphorylated proteins with the cytoskeleton-like structure. we hypothesize that this correlation is because phosphorylation plays an important role in the formation and/or regulation of the structure, and that it may represent a signaling network in the cell. whether or not the hypothesis proves true, this evidence warrants further study regarding the functional role of phosphorylation in host attachment, stress response, and cell morphology.

CONCLUSIONS
though it was previously not known whether phosphorylation was prevalent or played a significant role in the mycoplasmas, our results indicate that phosphorylation occurs at rates comparable to other studied prokaryotic species. based on the functional categories of the phosphoproteins found, protein phosphorylation in the mycoplasmas may be involved in sensing and regulation of stress responses, as well as cell division, gliding motility and cytadherence.
