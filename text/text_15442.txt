BACKGROUND
serum response factor  is a member of the mads  family of nuclear transcription factors. srf acts as a dimer to recognize the serum response element , a ten base pair at-rich sequence  <dig> gg), also referred to as the carg box  <cit> . the sre binding sequence is found in a diverse array of genes including cellular immediate early genes , neuronal nuclear receptors, and cytoskeletal and contractile proteins. the specificity of srf regulatory actions is context dependent and relies on combinatorial interactions between srf and various accessory factors. the elk- <dig> and sap- <dig> ets family members, which form nuclear complexes with srf, are direct targets for mitogen activated kinase  phosphorylation. also, the myocardin family of srf-interacting proteins  are important for regulating transcriptional targets associated with rho-mediated actin polymerization  <cit> .

srf is a central regulator of myogenic gene expression, cell differentiation and function. it is robustly expressed in cells of myogenic lineage  <cit> , and required for differentiation and development of skeletal myoblasts  <cit> , cardiomyocytes  <cit>  and smooth muscle cells   <cit> . the expression and regulation of muscle cell contractile proteins depend on srf transcriptional control  <cit> , and srf has been shown to provide a direct link between alterations in actin dynamics and consequential changes in nuclear transcription  is released from monomeric actin upon rho gtp-ase mediated actin polymerization  <cit> . once released, mal translocates to the nucleus and interacts with srf to mediate gene transcription of cytoskeletal apparatus proteins such as vinculin, actins, myosin, and focal adhesion  molecules as well as srf itself  <cit> .

srf has also been implicated as an important regulator of numerous events during early development. embryos globally lacking srf are unable to generate the embryonic mesoderm germ layer and die during gastrulation  <cit> . tissue specific deletions of the srf gene show it is essential for vascular smc differentiation  is also potentially regulated by srf  <cit> . mmp <dig>  together with mmp <dig>  is responsible for degradation of fibronectin and other ecm proteins, suggesting srf plays a role in the modulation of extracellular matrix  deposition and maintenance as well.

while srf has been established as a critical regulator of myogenic cells, relatively little is known about the role of srf in vascular endothelial cells . chai and colleagues  <cit>  showed that srf is required for appropriate vascular endothelial growth factor -dependent signaling in endothelial cells in vitro, suggesting a role for srf in vec function. more recent in vivo studies from our laboratory and others demonstrate that srf plays a critical role in endothelial cell function during early vascular development in the mouse  <cit> . knockout of srf expression in an endothelial specific manner by either tie2-cre  <cit>  or tie1-cre  <cit>  -mediated genomic recombination resulted in death by embryonic day 13- <dig>  . tie <dig> is a tyrosine kinase receptor expressed specifically on endothelial cells where it acts to mediate angiopoietin signaling  <cit> . both studies suggest that the defect in srf-null vecs stems from dysfunctional cell-cell and cell-ecm contacts. lack of appropriate cell contacts could also lead to inappropriate vascular permeability  as well as gross vascular damage, causing vascular failure and formation of microthrombi  <cit> , which are especially notable in the heart and body of vec-specific srf-null embryos  <cit> . we also observed severe disruption of vascular integrity in visceral yolk sac  tissues.

in the current study, we sought to characterize the severe disruption of vys vascular tissues observed in vec-specific srf-null embryos. mice homozygous for a floxed srf gene, srff/f  <cit>  were bred to mice expressing tie2-promoter driven cre recombinase  <cit> . the resulting tie2-cre+/ <dig> srff/f mutant genotype resulted in embryonic lethality by e <dig> . analysis of tie2-cre construct expression in mid-gestation vys revealed widespread contributions to vys mesoderm tissue from early progenitors. adhesion molecule organization, cell-cell and cell-matrix contacts, and various junction complexes as well as actin dynamics associated with intracellular signaling are disrupted throughout the vys mesoderm following the tie2-cre-mediated loss of srf. these results are consistent with previous studies suggesting srf plays a role in controling expression of adhesion molecules and is involved with cell-matrix associated signaling cascades. additionally, we find that srf-null vys mesoderm cells continue to proliferate while wild-type tissues with unimpaired adhesive contacts do not. these data suggest that perturbed signaling through cell-cell and cell-matrix contacts results in a loss of adhesion-dependent growth arrest. these data also suggest that a non-srf dependent mechanism such as the jak/stat pathway may be responsible for proliferation in vys mesoderm. consequently, srf appears to be vital for the formation and maintenance of adhesive contacts but dispensable for proliferation during angiogenic remodeling and vascular plexus maturation.

RESULTS
tie2-cre-mediated loss of srf is specific to vys mesoderm endothelial cells and is complete by e <dig> 
to establish the location and identity of cells in vys expressing the tie2-cre construct, indicating which cells would be targeted for srf genomic recombination, we bred male mice expressing the tie2-cre construct and heterozygous for the floxed srf allele  to female mice homozygous for both the floxed srf allele and the rosa26r-eyfp fluorescent reporter transgene . this genetic combination enabled us to track effective tie2-cre-mediated excision by staining for eyfp expression, identifying cells in which the floxed srf gene had potentially undergone recombination. subsequent double-label immunofluorescence analysis of e <dig>  vys revealed that loss of detectable srf protein was specific to cells with efficient tie2-cre activity . vys mesoderm cells expressing tie2-cre as shown by the presence of eyfp protein contained no detectable levels of srf in contrast to comparable tie2-cre-/- vys tissues. eyfp expression was observed throughout the vys mesoderm but not in vys endoderm. immunofluorescence detection of vascular endothelial cadherin  demonstrated the endothelial identity of cells within the vys mesoderm . separate studies using rosa26r-β-galactosidase reporter transgenic mice confirm the observed eyfp expression pattern . for these experiments, male tie2-cre+/ <dig> mice were bred with female rosa26r-βgal+/+ mice; resulting vys tissues were lac-z stained to uncover tie2-cre-related β-galactosidase activity. lac-z staining was evident in vascular tissues by e <dig> ; by e <dig>  staining was robust and widespread throughout the vys mesoderm but completely absent from vys endoderm. taken together, these data demonstrate the vys mesoderm endothelial-specific expression of tie2-cre.

the tie2-cre transgenic construct begins expressing by e <dig>  in early vys in the mouse embryo  <cit> . this timing coincides with the development of vys blood islands and onset of initial haematopoiesis  <cit> . vascular structures in vys mature, and blood cell production continues until haematopoiesis shifts to sites within the embryo by e <dig> . we previously showed that tie2-cre-mediated loss of srf results in embryo lethality by e <dig>   <cit> . we showed that tie2cre+/0·srff/f embryos appear normal until e <dig>  but begin exhibiting evidence of vascular failure and haemorrhaging by e <dig> . this becomes more pronounced by e <dig> , and embryos are dying or dead by e <dig> . vys tissues from these embryos mirror the same timeframe of vascular disruption as observed in the embryo. the tie2-cre construct begins expression in vys at e <dig> , some days earlier than a grossly observable phenotype at e <dig> . we therefore determined the timeline of srf loss within the vys mesoderm by generating embryos using the breeding scheme described above, and harvesting tie2cre+/0·srff/f and wild-type littermate embryos at e <dig> , e <dig> , and e <dig>  for srf expression analysis. we found that srf loss is complete in vys mesoderm cells of tie2cre+/0·srff/f embryos by e <dig>   despite being detectable in both wild type and mutant tissues at e <dig>  and e <dig>  . we counted individual srf-positive nuclei in vys mesoderm from tie2cre+/0·srff/f and wild-type littermate embryos, and expressed the result as a percentage of total nuclei detected  . the number of vys mesoderm cells containing detectable levels of srf is significantly decreased at e <dig>  , as well as at e <dig>   and nearly absent from e <dig>  tie2cre+/0·srff/f vys mesoderm . to establish that the lowered levels of srf protein were capable of affecting the expression of srf-dependent genes, tissues stained for srf were also stained for smooth muscle α-actin . acta <dig> is a cytoskeletal protein dependent on srf for expression  <cit>  and was not used as a marker for the presence of smooth muscle cells. acta <dig> expression was detectable in wild-type vys mesoderm by e <dig>  and remained so through e <dig>  , but appeared disrupted in e <dig>  tie2cre+/0·srff/f vys tissues. disruption of acta <dig> expression continued and worsened in e <dig>  and e <dig>  tie2cre+/0·srff/f vys mesoderm.

together the data presented in figures  <dig> and  <dig> demonstrate that srf protein is progressively lost from e <dig>  through e <dig> , being largely or completely lost by e <dig>  in vys mesoderm tissues of tie2cre+/0·srff/f embryos. complete loss of srf protein is preceded by detectable alterations in srf-dependent proteins such as acta <dig> 

alterations in cell contacts contribute to vys failure
srf has been demonstrated to be an important regulator of cell shape, integrity, migration, and adhesion  cell-cell contacts, 2) cell-matrix contacts, and 3) ecm deposition.

to address potential changes in expression of adhesion molecules and ecm in srf-null vys mesoderm in more detail, we generated endothelial-specific srf-null embryos using the breeding scheme described above and harvested tie2cre+/0·srff/f and wild-type littermate embryos at e <dig>  for analysis. we focused our attention on tissues of this age since the vascular phenotype observed was most consistent by this developmental timepoint. we examined the ec-specific adhesion molecule ve-cad as a measure of appropriate cell-cell contact. ve-cad is a vec-specific transmembrane adhesion protein associated with adherens junctions   <cit> . it forms homodimeric complexes between adjacent cells and is expressed in all vecs upon committed differentiation. tie2cre+/0·srff/f vys mesoderm tissues display decreased ve-cad immunoreactivity compared to wild-type tissues . this result is consistent with our previous observation of contact deficiencies at an ultrastructural level between endothelial cells.

to address cell-matrix contact, we examined integrin α <dig>  expression. α <dig> is a member of the integrin family of proteins that form heterodimeric complexes composed of one alpha and one beta chain  <cit> . α <dig> pairs with integrin β <dig>  to bind specifically to fibronectin- <dig>  in ecm and form cell-matrix fas. vecs express several integrin family members, and global knockouts of either α <dig> or β <dig> cause defective vascular development and embryonic lethality  <cit> . however, recent studies examining vec-specific loss of α <dig> did not detect impaired vasculogenesis  <cit>  in contrast to vec-specific ablation of β <dig> that results in embryonic lethality  <cit> . other studies suggest that the itga <dig> gene may be under srf regulatory control as evidenced by the presence of an sre within its promoter  <cit> . we detected α <dig> protein at sites of cell-matrix interactions in both wild type and tie2cre+/0·srff/f vys tissues . we did not observe large changes in α <dig> protein expression patterns despite the lack of srf protein observed in vys tissues at this time, suggesting that loss of cell-ecm contacts in srf deficient animals is due to another mechanism.

to address whether loss of srf may affect signaling associated with fas, we examined vinculin  expression. vcl is a membrane-associated protein involved with linkage of β <dig> cytoplasmic tails to the actin cytoskeleton  <cit> . it is important as a regulator of mechanical stress between extracellular forces and intracellular response through cytoskeletal dynamics. vcl expression is dependent on srf/mrtf-mediated transcriptional regulation, and the vcl gene is predicted to contain an sre within its promoter  <cit> . we examined vcl protein expression patterns in vys mesoderm by immunofluorescence and found detectable protein in both wild-type and srf-null tissues at e <dig>  . however, by e <dig> , vcl staining was moderately disrupted in tie2cre+/0·srff/f compared to wild-type tissues . disturbance of vcl staining was correlated with loss of srf protein as shown by double-label analysis.

to address whether srf plays a role in the loss of ecm deposition we previously observed in tie2cre+/0·srff/f vys tissues, we assayed for the ecm component fn <dig>  fn <dig> displays robust expression around developing vessels  <cit>  and induces intracellular signaling via interactions with the fn <dig> receptor integrin pair α5β <dig>  <cit> . fn <dig> protein expression was visible in both wild-type and srf-null vys tissues at e <dig>  . in contrast, tie2cre+/0·srff/f vys tissues showed a profound decrease in detectable fn <dig> compared to wild-type tissues at e <dig>  . tissue sections were co-stained with e-cadherin  to demonstrate contact deficient status of srf-null tissues due to primary antibody incompatibility with the anti-srf antibody.

taken together, these data provide evidence that the loss of srf in vys mesoderm results in disruption of cell-cell and cell-ecm contacts. decreased ve-cad protein indicates that intercellular adhesion between ec is disordered. cell-ecm adhesion is also disturbed due to a significant lack of ecm-associated fn <dig> despite apparently unaffected levels of α <dig>  furthermore, the observed decrease in vcl protein suggests that vcl-dependent intracellular signaling cascades may be perturbed.

gene expression analysis shows srf-null vys tissue is contact deficient
to examine potential changes in gene transcription in srf-null vys tissue, we assayed whole vys from e <dig>  embryos using real-time quantitative pcr  . separation of mesoderm from endoderm in tie2cre+/0·srff/f vys was not feasible due to the fragile nature of srf-null vys tissues. we focused our analysis on genes involved in cellular adhesion that are either known or predicted to be targets of srf regulation as well as those we found altered during our immunofluorescence studies. results are expressed using the 2^ΔΔct method where a value of  <dig> indicates no difference between groups. srf expression was found to be decreased  in tie2cre+/0·srff/f vys tissue; message in vys endoderm not affected by tie2-cre-mediated genomic excision may account for the message detected given the lack of visible srf signal in vys mesoderm identified by immunofluorescence. we found a trend toward decreased expression of acta <dig> . our own observations of virtually undetectable expression of acta <dig> protein in srf-null vys  support previously reported observations that acta <dig> expression is srf-dependent. aj-associated ve-cad  expression was profoundly decreased , as was expression of another ec-specific homophilic adhesion molecule, pecam <dig> . expression of the intracellular signaling molecule β-catenin  that partners with ve-cad and pecam <dig> proteins was not changed . expression of the ec-specific tight junction  component claudin  <dig>  was not detectable in mutant tissues, while expression of its associated intracellular signaling molecule tight junction protein  <dig>  was slightly increased . we assayed itga <dig> and itgb <dig> expression as a measure of fa assembly and found they were relatively unchanged , consistent with our observation of minimal change in α <dig> protein. in contrast, vcl expression was not detectable in mutant tissues, suggesting that failure of fas is due at least in part to the lack of linkage between membrane-associated integrins and the actin cytoskeleton. we did not detect any evidence of integrin-linked kinase  expression in any tissue; ilk qpcr primer specificity was verified against hela cell cdna . furthermore, expression of fn <dig> was decreased , implying a lack of ecm substrate for binding of integrins at the plasma membrane. our immunofluorescence analysis demonstrating profound disruption of both vcl and fn <dig> proteins corroborates these changes in gene expression. taken together, expression analysis of the three pairs of junction related proteins suggests a cumulative effect of adhesion failures, and that cell-cell and cell-ecm contact deficiency and impaired integrin signaling is at least partly responsible for the vascular phenotype observed in tie2cre+/0·srff/f embryos.

srf is not required for proliferation of vys mesoderm cells
consistent with a role for srf in mediating growth factor signaling, it has been shown in a number of cell types that loss of srf inhibits proliferation  <cit> . cell adhesion-associated signaling is intimately connected to appropriate regulation of proliferation as well as other functions such as migration and differentiation . all brdu-positive cells detected in wild-type tissues also expressed srf, although most srf-positive cells were not positive for brdu demonstrating that srf expression alone is not sufficient for proliferation. as shown in figure  <dig> wild-type vys mesoderm cells exhibit a decrease in proliferation from e <dig>  to e <dig> ; however, srf-null vys mesoderm did not follow this same pattern, showing instead a sustained rate of proliferation. this difference was first observed at e <dig>  , reached statistical significance by e <dig>  , and remained divergent at e <dig>  . cells with brdu-positive nuclei were visible throughout e <dig>  vys mesoderm despite the complete lack of srf by this time-point. furthermore, the few remaining srf-positive cells at e <dig>  were all brdu-positive, even though the vast majority of brdu-positive cells lacked srf. it is important to note that the non-nuclear staining observed within the brush-border of the vys endoderm is a result of anti-mouse secondary antibody detection of maternofetally transferred igg molecules  <cit> . this phenomenon is confined to the vys endoderm that functions, in part, to take up igg molecules secreted into the uterine lumen. no such non-nuclear staining is detected within the vys mesoderm that is the focus of our analysis. the aberrant proliferation observed in mutant vys using brdu analysis was substantiated by similar findings using phosphorylated histone h <dig>  detection to assess proliferation . phh <dig> is a marker for the heavily phosphorylated form of histone h <dig> associated with cells in metaphase, and is lost as cells exit the cell cycle. in contrast, brdu incorporation may be found in dna synthesized as cells enter the cell cycle, indicating both current and accumulated proliferation since the time of brdu administration. to verify that these cells were srf-deficient owing to tie2-cre-mediated recombination, we also stained these tissues for eyfp to detect effective cre recombinase activity . we found that brdu-positive cells in tie2cre+/0·srff/f vys mesoderm also expressed eyfp, indicating that their srf-null status was due to tie2-cre-mediated genomic recombination. tie <dig> along with ve-cad have been used extensively to label vecs owing to their restricted expression patterns. ve-cad is an endothelial-specific adhesion molecule associated with adherens junctions . taken together with tie2cre-excised eyfp expression, the detection of these endothelial markers throughout the vys mesoderm demonstrate that all proliferative cells detected are endothelial in nature.

to assess the possibility that srf-null cells were not being detected due to apoptotic loss, we also assayed srf-null and wild-type littermate vys tissues using terminal deoxynucleotide transferase dutp nick end labeling . tie2cre+/0·srff/f vys tissues stained using tunel did not show any consistent differences in the level of apoptosis between wild-type and srf-null tissues, , strongly suggesting that the vascular failure observed in srf null embryos is not due simply to loss of cells in developing vys.

discussion
vys is comprised of two layers: a mesoderm-derived layer of narrow elongated cells and an endoderm-derived layer of brush border-presenting columnar epithelial cells. vys mesoderm generates blood cell and vascular precursors within blood islands by e <dig>   <cit> , followed by expansion and maturation of the vys vascular tree by e <dig> . angiogenic remodeling of initial blood vessels into a mature and efficient vascular plexus requires the orchestration of ec migration, proliferation and apoptosis. once blood flow begins, hemodynamic stresses cause alterations in adhesion molecule expression profiles and ec function, ultimately leading to vessel rearrangement. these processes depend heavily upon and in turn profoundly affect cellular adhesion, both with other cells and the surrounding matrix . ec-ecm contact occurs at fas that consist of integrin receptor pairs and associated intracellular factors. fn <dig> is a prominent component of the ecm surrounding developing vessels, and it serves as a ligand for the α5β1-integrin receptor pair on ec  <cit> . fn1-mediated activation of α5β <dig> leads to the induction of focal adhesion kinase  signaling pathways including src recruitment, pi <dig> kinase induction, raf/mek/erk induction and nf-κb activation  in the case of ve-cad, and zo- <dig> associated with cldn <dig>  furthermore, activation of integrin-mediated src signaling results in disruption of ve-cad-associated aj, adding to the complex interconnected nature of cellular adhesion  <cit> . collectively, the signaling pathways initiated at junctional complexes act to balance the control of cellular proliferation as well as migration . loss of proteins along these signaling cascades may result in unintended cellular quiescence or uncontrolled proliferation.

examination of the tie2-cre-mediated knockdown of srf in vys mesoderm has provided evidence to support a significant role for srf in endothelial cell function. previous work demonstrated that endothelial-specific ablation of srf protein in mice resulted in loss of vascular integrity and function within vys and ultimately caused embryonic death by mid-gestation  <cit> . our current studies suggest that failure of srf-null vys tissues and subsequent vascular failure of embryos is due to disrupted junction complexes and junction-related signaling molecules in endothelial cells of the vys mesoderm. our observation that loss of srf leads to alterations in cell contact proteins is consistent with previous reports in other cell types. embryonic stem cells lacking srf are unable to form fa or bind appropriately with extracellular matrices  <cit> . studies in epithelial cells have verified a need for srf in establishing cell-cell contacts in developing epidermis  <cit> . various studies suggest that this effect is dependent at least in part on srf's ability to regulate actin dynamics, including those necessary for formation and maintenance of adhesive contacts. actin filaments link with fa via integrin-associated proteins such as α-actinin, talin, and vcl, providing adhesion-related cellular input and subsequent modulation of cell shape, motility, survival and proliferation  <cit> . our results demonstrating a lack of vcl in srf-null tissues strongly suggest that fas are unable to connect with the actin cytoskeleton appropriately, resulting in impaired fa-dependent signaling.

we detected profound alterations in vcl and acta <dig> protein patterns and mrna expression levels in srf-null vys tissues. expression of vcl and other fa molecules such as tropomyosin is regulated by srf and mrtfs through a rho/mal-dependent mechanism  <cit> . furthermore, the vcl gene has a predicted sre binding element  <cit> , raising the likelihood that srf directly controls vcl expression in vys tissues. disrupted vcl expression causes perturbations in integrin-actin signaling as well as decreased fak signaling  <cit> . acta <dig> is regulated by srf, and its loss likely contributes to the defect generated by disrupted vcl, compounding the mis-regulation of srf-dependent actin dynamics. our study did not detect significant disruption of itga <dig> expression despite the presence of a predicted sre in the itga <dig> gene  <cit> , perhaps indicating that itga <dig> is not under srf regulatory control in vys tissues. additionally, there is no evidence to suggest fn <dig> is under direct regulation by srf. however, we observed substantial loss of fn <dig> in ecm of srf-null vys tissues, suggesting defects in either the transmission of extracellular signaling or in ecm maintenance. vys endoderm signals to vys mesoderm through a retinoic acid-transforming growth factor β <dig>  dependent pathway  <cit> , and chimaeric mice lacking functional tgfβ receptors show deficient deposition of fn <dig> between the vys endoderm and mesoderm layers  <cit> . our observed loss of fn <dig> protein was accompanied by a slight decrease in tgfb <dig> expression , highlighting the requirement of this signaling cascade for proper vys development and subsequent vascular integrity. furthermore, fn <dig> deposition and maintenance depends on appropriate fa signaling. the lack of intracellular vcl we observed in srf-null vys tissues suggests that impaired fa signaling contributes to the loss of extracellular fn <dig>  <cit> . our observation of decreased ve-cad and cldn <dig> proteins suggests that aj and tj functions are also impaired. ve-cad associated with aj has been demonstrated to mediate contact inhibition of ec proliferation  <cit> . cldn <dig> has not been shown to act on cell cycle progression; however, expression of cldn <dig> is at least in part regulated by ve-cad  <cit> , and suggests that tj act along with aj to stabilize ec intracellular adhesion.

our analysis also revealed that srf-null vys endothelial cells have impaired proliferative control, and, in contrast to cells in wild-type vys, fail to downregulate proliferation. this is consistent with a model in which, during normal development, adhesive contacts and associated signal pathways balance proliferative signals, but that loss of srf leads to disruption of inhibitory pathways and uncontrolled proliferation . our observed loss of ve-cad is consistent with a loss of the proliferative control conferred by aj-mediated signaling. it should be pointed out that our model does not posit that srf serves as a direct inhibitor of proliferation genes, but rather that in some cell types, such as vys mesoderm endothelial cells, inhibitory pathways are modulated by srf. furthermore, unlike in some other cell types, our data provides strong evidence that these cells do not require srf protein for proliferation, implying utilization of non-srf-dependent pathways for proliferation.

given results presented here that srf-null vys endothelial cells continue to proliferate, it seems likely that these cells do not require srf to proliferate even in wild-type tissues. numerous cell types have demonstrated a dependence on srf-driven ieg expression for proliferation, including fibroblasts  <cit>  and cells of myogenic lineage  <cit> . however, few cell types are known to proliferate without srf, among them mouse embryonic stem cells  <cit> . recently, koegel and colleagues  <cit>  found that hyperproliferative skin cells down-regulate srf expression, suggesting that there may be multiple cell types that use alternative non-srf dependent pathways to regulate proliferation. they also observed defects in both cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesive contacts, suggesting that these phenomena are likely interrelated. furthermore, recent studies of srf-null hematopoietic stem cells  demonstrate that they also exhibit cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion failure, that this failure is due to impaired integrin-related signaling, and that hsc proliferation is not negatively affected by the loss of srf  <cit> . these observations are consistent with our model where srf acts as a modulator of cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion molecules that indirectly affect proliferation due to a loss of adhesion-mediated inhibition. down-regulation of srf in this context allows modulation of adhesive integrity and associated actin-dependent junction maintenance necessary for cellular proliferation and migration; however, srf-independent proliferation of cells within the vys mesoderm that is required for angiogenic remodeling remains functionally intact.

CONCLUSIONS
our study provides evidence to suggest that the role of srf in proliferation is balanced with its role in actin-dependent junction dynamics. it remains to be determined which junction proteins are affected through direct srf-mediated transcriptional regulation and which may be dependent on srf-related actin dynamics for proper function. the intimacy between the actin cytoskeleton and membrane bound adhesion molecules provides a broad reach for srf to respond to signaling that initiates at the plasma membrane. our results demonstrating that loss of cellular adhesive contacts results in impaired proliferative control is consistent with previous studies; however, we show for the first time evidence that vys mesoderm endothelial cells do not require srf for proliferation. further study will be necessary to determine which proliferative pathway dominates in these cells.
