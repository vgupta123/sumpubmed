BACKGROUND
during the development from embryo to adult life vertebrates use a succession of kidney forms to maintain extracellular fluid homeostasis and simultaneously rid the body of nitrogenous wastes  <cit> . three spatially and temporally different kidney generations form from the intermediate mesoderm in an anterior to posterior direction i.e. the pronephroi, mesonephroi and metanephroi  <cit> . the functional unit in these paired kidneys is the nephron, and it is composed of a filtration unit and a renal tubule. urine is produced by the filtration of blood in the filtration unit, followed by the selective reabsorption and secretion of ions, organic molecules and water across highly specialized epithelia of the renal tubule  <cit> . nephrons open into a ureter, and in the meso- and metanephros they do so via a collecting duct system  <cit> . this system is the site for the important final adjustment of the urine. vertebrate kidneys may produce urine, which is either hypoosmotic , isoosmotic or hyperosmotic  relative to the body fluids  <cit> . this ability is a function of i) the evolutionary state of the nephrons and ii) the regulation of filtration and of the transport of inorganic ions, organic molecules and water across the renal epithelia.

the first kidneys to form - the embryonic pronephric kidneys - are the functional kidneys of fish and amphibian larvae  <cit> . these are very simple kidneys composed of a single nephron. a characteristic of vertebrate kidney organogenesis is the development of a pronephric duct in association with each pronephros  <cit> . these ducts are the first or primary ureters of vertebrate kidney systems. they form the collecting duct system of the meso- and metanephroi, and they, and their derivates, are the key players in the induction of the nephrogenic mesenchyme, which forms these latter kidney generations. few functional studies exist on the pronephros and functional studies of the duct are virtually lacking. molecular studies have been directed at mapping genes expressed in different segments of the pronephric nephron, and several recent reviews have highlighted the potential use of this embryonic kidney in drug and human kidney disease assessment  <cit> . to date, there has been little focus on the role of the pronephric duct in urine modification and it remains to be shown whether transepithelial transport processes are present in this structure. ultrastructural investigations have shown duct cells with the characteristics of an epithelium involved in active transport e.g. many mitochondria and surface expansions of the basolateral cell membranes  <cit> . in addition, gene expression assays have indicated high expression of transporters known to be involved in ion transport, such as the na+/k+-atpase and the romk channel  <cit> . collectively, these data suggest that the pronephric duct may play an important role in regulation of extracellular fluid homeostasis. therefore we ask the question: is the duct involved in urine modification?

in amphibians the pronephros is a large organ, which is functional for a considerable time, before it degenerates. we investigate structural and functional characteristics of the pronephric duct in the freshwater amphibian ambystoma mexicanum . members of the ambystoma genus have been used as models for the study of pronephric structure, function, development and evolution for more than a century  <cit>  and the formation and caudal migration of the pronephric duct in the axolotl has been thoroughly investigated  <cit> . numerous functional studies exist on the mesonephric collecting duct system of both urodele and anuran amphibians, which provide detailed information on the transport characteristics of these segments . our histological examinations and dissections of axolotl larvae indicate that the pronephros is functional from the time of hatching to larval stage  <dig>  we investigate duct morphology and cellular transport mechanisms present in larvae with functional pronephroi, and show that the primary ureter is important for urine dilution in the axolotl. the single cell type found in the ureter shows the characteristics of the vertebrate collecting duct system principal cell and our data indicate that it reabsorbs na+ and secretes k+.

RESULTS
identification of functional pronephroi and pronephric ducts
we determined the interval in which the axolotl pronephros and pronephric duct is functional by investigating kidney structure in freshly dissected larvae and in larvae prepared for histology . the pronephroi of axolotl larvae are paired organs located on each side of the dorsal aorta in the most anterior part of the body cavity. they are visible from the outside on the dorsal side of the larva as two small bulges behind the gills . each of the two kidneys are composed of a filtrating unit - a glomus originating from the dorsal aorta, and a single convoluted renal tubule opening into the coelom via two ciliated nephrostomes . the pronephros is fully functional when the axolotl larva hatches from the egg at stage  <dig>  this was confirmed by the appearance of blood cells in the capillaries of the glomus, which from embryonic stage  <dig> had a fully developed endothelium and a visceral layer with podocytes. from stage  <dig> the cilia of the nephrostomes points toward the lumen of the renal tubule, indicating a passage of fluid from the coelom. at this stage the kidney consists of an external glomus and a renal tubule with the following morphologically determined segments: two nephrostomes, each connected to a branch of proximal tubule, a common proximal tubule and a distal tubule. the pronephric duct runs caudally as an extension of the distal tubule opening into the cloaca. from the time of hatching the kidney was observed to increase in overall size due to further segmentation of the renal tubule i.e. the development of a ciliated intermediary segment; present from stage  <dig> . the fully segmented pronephric tubule consists of the following morphological defined segments: two nephrostomial tubules, two proximal tubule branches, a common proximal tubule, a ciliated intermediary segment and a distal tubule . at stage  <dig> the mesonephros was clearly visible and functional as judged by glomerular maturation and presence of blood cells in the mesonephric glomerular capillaries. hence, comparable to the situation found in anuran amphibians  <cit>  the two kidney generations functionally overlap in axolotl larvae. at stage  <dig> the pronephros reaches its maximal size. gonadal primordia were observed medioventral to the mesonephros . these were undifferentiated and sex determination was not possible. during the transition from stage  <dig> to latter stages, characterized by fully developed hind limbs, overall pronephric tubule and glomus volume decreased, marking pronephric degeneration. pronephric structure in stage 52- <dig> larvae of ambystoma mexicanum resembled the description by christensen  of the functional pronephros in a. punctatum  <cit> .

pronephric duct structure
structural examination of the pronephric duct in larvae with functional pronephroi revealed that the duct consists of a single cell type . thus, the heterocellularity with intercalated mitochondria-rich cells interposed between principal cells, characteristic of the collecting duct system of latter kidney generations, is not seen at this point . this is comparable to the situation in the green toad, bufo viridis - a terrestrial anuran amphibian  <cit> . the pronephric duct cells in a. mexicanum are approximately  <dig> μm high in early larval stages, but decrease in height to 10- <dig> μm in stage  <dig> and  <dig> larvae . they have a relatively smooth apical surface. a single central cilium is present  in addition to small and sparse microvilli, which are more numerous at the point of the apical cell junctions. the nucleus is regularly shaped, centrally placed and contains a nucleolus and patches of heterochromatin. there is a conspicuous basal labyrinth, and lateral infoldings are seen as well . the cytoplasm contains many mitochondria in addition to a golgi complex and endoplasmatic reticulum. the morphology of the duct changes at the level of the mesonephros in late larval stages 52- <dig>  revealing the presence of intercalated, mitochondria-rich cells .

ion transport mechanisms in the pronephric duct of larvae stage 46-54
we examined if the pronephric duct participates in final urine modification with the aid of glass microelectrodes and ion substitution experiments in isolated and perfused ducts dissected from  <dig> larvae. figure 3a is a frequency distribution of the membrane potential  of  <dig> impaled cells. the data show a broad distribution with an average vm between - <dig> and - <dig> mv. transport characteristics of the duct did not seem to differ between early and late larval stages. as shown in figure 3b and 3c, raising the k+ concentration in the basal solution from  <dig> to  <dig> mmol/l resulted in a large, reversible depolarization of vm, revealing the presence of a large basolateral k+ conductance. this indicates the presence of k+ channels in the basolateral cell membrane. we examined whether the duct has luminal electrogenic transporters or channels in experiments with luminal k+ and na+ steps. figure  <dig> shows the result of these substitution experiments. vm hyperpolarized upon a decrease in luminal na+ concentration from  <dig> to  <dig> mmol/l and depolarized upon an increase in luminal k+ concentration from  <dig> to  <dig> mmol/l. this indicates that the luminal  cell membrane possesses na+ as well as k+ channels. in order to identify an ion pump, which can provide the driving force for luminal uptake of na+ as well as k+ secretion, we isolated pronephric ducts and performed immunolabeling with an antibody directed against the na+-k+-atpase α-subunit. as shown in figure  <dig>  the na+-k+-atpase is highly expressed in the pronephric ducts from these larvae, and is entirely localized to the lateral and highly invaginated basolateral cell membranes.

electrophysiological studies performed on the mesonephric collecting duct system of amphibians, have indicated that principal cells in aquatic urodeles, have a large apical na+ conductance and no, or very small, k+ conductance. however, in terrestrial anurans, k+ secretion through apical k+ channels seems a major task of the principal cells  <cit> . in the current study we provide evidence for a principal cell, which has the characteristics of the mammalian collecting duct principal cell, i.e. with luminal na+ as well as k+ conductances.

CONCLUSIONS
we show that the pronephric duct, which is the first or primary ureter in all vertebrates, participates in urine adjustment in the axolotl. the cells constituting the duct are on the ultrastructural as well as cell physiological level comparable to principal cells found in the first segments of the mammalian collecting duct system  <cit> . notably, the pronephric duct lacks intercalated, mitochondria-rich cells. we propose that the duct is important for urine dilution through nacl reabsorbtion, and that it in addition participates in the regulation of k+ homeostasis. figure  <dig> provides a model of the ion transport mechanisms, which we suggest are present in the duct cell. in this model a na+-k+-atpase in the basolateral cell membrane pumps na+ out of the cell and thereby provides the driving force for apical uptake of na+ through channels. the epithelial sodium channel  is a likely candidate mediating this apical na+ uptake  <cit> . na+ exits the cell through the pump. k+ is secreted through apical channels, and is recycled for the pump across the basolateral cell membrane. it is highly probable that romk channels, known to mediate k+ secretion in the mammalian collecting duct system  <cit> , and shown to be expressed in amphibian pronephric ducts  <cit> , mediate k+ secretion across the apical cell membrane. the active transport of na+ would create a lumen-negative transepithelial potential, and cl- would presumably follow passively through the paracellular pathway of this epithelium  <cit> . this is to our knowledge the first characterization of the pronephric duct-the precursor of the collecting duct system- which provides detailed information on cell structure and the basic mechanisms for ion transport.
