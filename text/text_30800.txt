BACKGROUND
the aryl hydrocarbon receptor  is a ligand activated transcription factor  belonging to the basic-helix-loop-helix-pas  family of proteins that serve as environmental sensors  <cit> .  <dig> , <dig> -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin  is the prototypical ahr ligand, a ubiquitous environmental contaminant that elicits diverse species-specific effects, including tumor promotion, teratogenesis, hepatotoxicity, modulation of endocrine systems, immunotoxicity and enzyme induction  <cit> . these effects result from alterations in gene expression mediated by the ahr  <cit> . several studies have demonstrated the requirement for the ahr in mediating tcdd-elicited responses. for example, mice carrying low-affinity ahr alleles are less susceptible to the effects elicited by tcdd  <cit> . additionally, ahr-null mice fail to induce responses typically observed following treatment with tcdd and related compounds  <cit> .

tcdd binding to the cytosolic ahr results in a conformational change and translocation to the nucleus. the activated ahr complex heterodimerizes with the aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator , another bhlh-pas family member, and binds dioxin response elements  containing the substitution intolerant 5'-gcgtg-3' core sequence to regulate changes in gene expression  <cit> . computational searches for all dre cores in the human, mouse and rat genome identified the highest density of dres proximal to a transcriptional start site   <cit> . however, a significant number of dre cores and putative functional dres have been identified in distal regions within non-coding intergenic segments of the genome. it has been proposed that enrichments for other tfs on outlying regions may be functionally relevant through tertiary looping of genomic dna and/or via protein tethering mechanisms  <cit> .

the role of specific transcriptional regulators has been studied on a gene-by-gene basis, primarily focusing on regions proximal to the tss. however, the coupling of chromatin immunoprecipitation with either genomic tiling microarrays  or next-generation sequencing  has facilitated genome-wide analysis of protein-dna interactions for a variety of receptors  <cit> , tfs  <cit>  and components of the basal transcriptional machinery  <cit> . genome-wide location analyses further suggest that tf binding at cis-regulatory enhancers in intergenic dna regions of the genome may also have functional significance  <cit> .

several studies have investigated ahr-mediated gene expression responses using various technologies  <cit> . although ahr-dna interactions have primarily focused on the regulation of cyp1a <dig>  <cit> , recent global chip studies have extended our knowledge of ahr-dna interactions by examining promoter region binding profiles using in vitro and in vivo models  <cit>  . our study provides a comprehensive analysis by examining tcdd-induced ahr binding across the entire mouse genome. in addition, we examined ahr binding within chromosomes, intragenic and intergenic dna regions, and in specific genic regions . global ahr enrichment data are also integrated with computational dre core analysis  <cit> , and complementary whole-genome gene expression profiling to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the hepatic ahr regulatory network elicited by tcdd.

RESULTS
identification and characterization of tcdd-elicited ahr enrichment
in order to identify regions of ahr enrichment induced by tcdd across the genome, chip-chip assays were performed using hepatic tissue from immature ovariectomized mice orally gavaged with  <dig> μg/kg tcdd for  <dig> and  <dig> hrs. cisgenome  <cit>  analysis identified  <dig>  and  <dig>  enriched regions at  <dig> and  <dig> hrs, respectively. applying a conservative fdr of  <dig>  resulted in  <dig>  and  <dig> significant ahr enriched regions at  <dig> and  <dig> hrs, respectively . ligand activation of the ahr in vivo triggers its own rapid degradation and causing a significant reduction of ahr levels  <cit> . this is reflected in the significantly lower number of tcdd-induced ahr enriched regions at  <dig> hrs as compared to  <dig> hrs. the distribution, location and enrichment values for each tiled probes across the cyp1a <dig> gene  are summarized in figure  <dig>  ma value plots visualize the profile of the enriched region and log <dig> fold-enrichment values for each probe are also illustrated . note that the probes are unevenly tiled throughout the genome, resulting in gaps in genome coverage that may coincide with dre core locations that may affect ahr enriched region identification. for example, two enriched regions were associated with cyp1a <dig> . however, the ma plots for  <dig> and  <dig> hrs suggest that there is only one large region of enrichment divided into two as a result of the uneven tiling. consequently, uneven tiling and the lack of tiling in regions that contain dres may affect the estimated number of ahr enriched regions.

genomic regions with significant ahr enrichment were mapped to intragenic  and non-coding intergenic regions . most regions were enriched  <dig> -fold with values ranging from  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold . enriched regions varied in width from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp  with  <dig> % spanning ≤  <dig>  bp. there was no correlation between fold enrichment and region width . of the  <dig> significantly enriched regions at  <dig> h  <dig> of them overlapped with a  <dig> hr enriched region , consistent with reports of constant shuttling of the ahr between the nucleus and cytoplasm  <cit> , and ahr promoter occupancy of targeted genes in untreated cells  <cit> . relaxing the fdr to  <dig>  increased the overlap to  <dig>  while reducing the number of  <dig> hr specific enriched regions to  <dig>  comparable overlaps were identified in promoter-specific chip-chip studies of tcdd-induced ahr enrichment at  <dig> and  <dig> hrs in the livers of intact c57bl/ <dig> mice, which identified  <dig>  number of genes with  <dig> overlap . further analysis of the  <dig> enriched regions found that the fold enrichment values from both time points were positively correlated .

although only 40% of the mouse genome consists of intragenic dna,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of all sites with significant ahr enrichment at  <dig> hrs and  <dig> hrs, respectively, were within this region. the density of ahr enrichment  was calculated across the entire genome in order to consider the cumulative intergenic and intragenic dna region lengths . genome and chromosomal analyses  revealed increased enrichment within intragenic regions compared to non-coding intergenic regions further illustrating a bias for gene encoding regions. however, these values may be inflated due to incomplete probe coverage in the intergenic regions and sequence gaps in the genome. specific analysis of the  <dig> kb upstream, 5' and 3' utrs and cds regions revealed the highest density of ahr enrichment was proximal to the tss . ahr enrichment density was greatest within ±  <dig>  kb at  <dig> and  <dig> hrs , coinciding with proximal promoter dre core densities  <cit>  and rna polymerase ii binding at the tsss  <cit> . interestingly, there is a notable cleft in ahr enrichment  <dig> bp directly upstream and downstream of the tsss, possibly to accommodate general transcription machinery. both global and proximal promoter density analyses illustrate tcdd-induced ahr enrichments are more prominent in regions directly associated with a gene. nevertheless, there are a significant number of distally located enrichment sites that may also be functionally relevant.

confirmation of ahr chip-chip enrichment analysis
selected regions of ahr enrichment identified by chip-chip analysis at  <dig> hrs were confirmed by chip-pcr . three representative chip-chip enrichments from each genomic region  were selected to validate ahr enrichments with and without a dre core at different positions relative to the tss. chip-pcr and chip-chip analysis of dre containing regions exhibited similar levels of ahr enrichment relative to iggtcdd controls and were significantly greater than vehicle controls relative to iggvehicle. ahr enriched regions without the dre core were also verified, further demonstrating that the ahr can interact with dna independent of a dre core, but does not eliminate the possibility of ahr interaction through dna looping or protein tethering. interestingly, the fold enrichment values for regions without the dre core were consistently lower than those with a dre core, suggesting ahr interactions are stronger in regions containing a dre.

dre analysis of ahr enriched regions
tcdd-elicited changes in gene expression are mediated through ahr signaling via binding to the substitution intolerant dre core sequence . overlaying tcdd-induced ahr enrichment with dre core locations throughout the mouse genome  <cit>  identified  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the enriched regions did not contain a dre core regions at  <dig> and  <dig> hrs, respectively . other promoter-specific chip-chip studies have also reported dre cores in ~50% of the ahr enriched regions  <cit> . the remaining enriched regions possessed at least one and as many as  <dig> dre cores . ahr enriched regions with or without a dre core exhibited similar widths and levels of enrichment.

b 5'-gcgtg-3' core sequence

matrix similarity  scores have been calculated for each  <dig> bp dre sequence within the mouse genome using a position weight matrix  constructed from bona fide functional dres  <cit> . of the  <dig>  significant ahr enriched regions containing a dre core ,  <dig> % were within  <dig> bp of a dre core  with half of these positions located within  <dig> bp of a dre core. however, only  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the ahr enriched regions at  <dig> and  <dig> hrs, respectively, possessed a putative functional  dre sequence  suggesting the ahr may bind other degenerate sequence elements.

ahr binding to an alternate response element  has also been reported  <cit> . of the  <dig>  and  <dig> enriched regions at  <dig> and  <dig> hrs, respectively, that did not contain a dre core,  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, contained the alternate dre sequence . the higher incidence of ahr enriched regions at  <dig> hrs containing the alternate response element may represent tertiary ahr binding sites resulting from conformational changes and crowding of the promoter with the general transcription machinery  <cit> .

transcription factor binding site over-representation analysis
significantly ahr enriched regions were computationally analyzed for over-represented response elements for known tf binding site  families using regionminer . dres as well other sites for early growth response , e2f, nuclear respiratory factor  <dig> , nuclear receptor subfamily  <dig> factors  and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  were over-represented within ahr enriched regions . many of these tf sites were enriched proximally to a dre core  suggesting possible interactions. studies have previously reported interactions between ahr and many of these tfs  <cit> . for example, ahr complexes with egr- <dig> following treatment of human huvec cells with high glucose concentrations  <cit> . in addition, ahr aggregates with e2f <dig> to inhibit e2f1-induced apoptosis  <cit> . ahr also directly interacts with coup-tf to repress er-mediated gene expression  <cit> .

de novo motif analysis
approximately 50% of enriched regions lacked the dre core sequence  suggesting ahr interacts with dna using alternate strategies. de novo motif analysis of these regions using the gibbs motif sampler in cisgenome identified over-representation of comparable repetitive elements in both the intergenic and intragenic dna regions . comparison of over-represented non-repetitive motifs to existing tf binding motifs in jaspar and transfac  <cit>  using stamp  <cit>  identified similarities to coup-tf, hepatocyte nuclear factor  <dig> , liver receptor homolog  <dig>  and ppar binding sites . interestingly, coup-tf and hnf <dig> belong to the nr2f family identified in the tfbs over-representation analysis of all ahr enriched regions . the presence of these binding motifs in non-dre containing regions of ahr enrichment further suggests that ahr-dna interactions occur through a tethering mechanism involving other tfs or by tertiary looping of dna.

gene level analysis of ahr enrichment
of the  <dig>  enrichments identified in the intragenic dna regions,  <dig> %  contained a dre core at  <dig> hrs, and  <dig> %  at  <dig> hrs . these intragenic ahr enriched regions mapped to  <dig>  and  <dig> unique genes at  <dig> and  <dig> hrs, respectively . molecular and cellular functional analysis using ingenuity pathway analysis  found these genes to be associated with lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, small molecule biochemistry, cell cycle and gene expression based on a fisher's exact test p-value <  <dig>  . furthermore,  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the genes associated with ahr enrichment at  <dig> and  <dig> hrs, respectively, contained a dre core within the region of enrichment . the higher percentage of genes containing a dre core compared to enriched regions with a dre core is due to multiple regions of ahr enrichment associated with a single gene . the remaining genes  with significant ahr enrichment were targeted independently of a dre core.

at both  <dig> and  <dig> hrs,  <dig> genes had ahr enrichment, with  <dig> possessing dre cores in the ahr enriched region . only  <dig> genes exhibited ahr enrichment solely at  <dig> hrs, with three containing a dre core. in contrast,  <dig>  genes possessed significant ahr enrichment with  <dig> %  containing a dre core within the region of enrichment at  <dig> hrs. due to the large overlap of enriched regions at  <dig> and  <dig> hrs, the remaining analysis focuses predominantly on the ahr enrichment at  <dig> hr.

comparison of transcriptional responses with ahr enrichment
gene expression analysis at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hrs identified  <dig>  unique differentially expressed genes  >  <dig> ) at one or more time points. of the  <dig>  tcdd-responsive genes,  <dig> genes  possessed significant ahr enrichment within the intragenic region . moreover, of the  <dig> genes exhibiting ahr enrichment at  <dig> hrs,  <dig> contained a dre core sequence, suggesting these responses are ahr-mediated. the remaining  <dig> differentially expressed genes were not associated with a ahr enriched region containing a dre core, and may be secondary responses. in order to concisely visualize the integration of the dre, chip-chip and gene expression analyses, circos plots were generated for the genome and individual chromosomes . the plots further illustrate the diversity in ahr enrichment locations in relation to the genomic position of dysregulated genes. further analysis of the responsive genes found that most were induced by tcdd  at all time points. greater than 82% of the induced genes at  <dig> or  <dig> hrs had significant ahr enrichment, and more than 62% of them contained at least one dre core suggesting that regulation is dre-dependent fashion. in contrast, only 35% of the  <dig> genes induced at  <dig> hrs, exhibited ahr enrichment with 26% possessing a dre core suggesting that these are secondary gene expression responses. interestingly, down-regulated genes associated with ahr enrichment were relatively consistent across all time points. approximately one third of the down-regulated genes appear to be ahr regulated with dre involvement.

functional analysis of the  <dig> differentially expressed genes associated with ahr enrichment was performed using david  <cit> . the most over-represented functions were associated with lipid metabolic processes , consistent with the induced fatty liver phenotype  <cit> . ipa analysis of these genes also identified lipid metabolism as an enriched molecular and cellular function . in addition, de novo motif analysis  identified binding sites for tfs associated with lipid metabolism and transport. the induction of ahr regulated xenobiotic enzymes, such as cytochrome p450s, glutathione s-transferases  and udp-glucuronosyltransferases , hallmarks of tcdd exposure, were also identified as an enriched cluster .

although ahr mediates the expression of enzymes involved in xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes, including nadp dehydrogenase, quinone  <dig>  and udp-glucose dehydrogenase  as well as several ugt and gst isoforms, they are also regulated by nuclear factor, erythroid derived  <dig>  like  <dig>  via antioxidant response elements in response to oxidative stress  <cit> . recent studies with ahr and nrf <dig> null mice report that tcdd induction of nqo <dig> is ahr and nrf <dig> dependent  <cit> . furthermore, specific ugt and gst isoforms induced by tcdd require nrf <dig>  collectively, these responses are referred to as the "tcdd-inducible ahr-nrf <dig> gene battery." chip-chip and gene expression analysis indicates that nqo <dig>  gstm <dig>  gstm <dig>  ugdh and nrf <dig> induction is associated with ahr enrichment. although supportive of the nrf2-dependency model, these data do not distinguish if these are secondary responses mediated by nrf <dig> alone, or involve an ahr-nrf <dig> interaction. in contrast, gsta <dig> and ugt2b <dig> induction occurred independently of ahr enrichment, suggesting they may only be dependent on nrf <dig>  <cit> .

immune cell accumulation following a single acute dose of tcdd at  <dig> hrs is presumed to be a secondary response to hepatic injury or fatty acid accumulation  <cit> . david analysis of genes induced at  <dig> hrs identified multiple over-represented immune-related clusters . however, several of the genes including complement component  <dig>  q subcomponent, beta polypeptide , cd <dig> antigen , complement component 4a  and interferon regulatory factor  <dig> , did not exhibit accompanying ahr enrichment within their intragenic region . only  <dig> out of  <dig> differentially regulated genes in the enriched immune clusters exhibited ahr enrichment. collectively, these data suggest that gene expression associated with immune function is a consequence of immune cell infiltration into the liver.

discussion
this study further elucidates the role of the ahr in mediating the hepatic effects of tcdd in c57bl <dig> mice. recent studies have mapped ahr binding using promoter-focused chip-chip arrays and found that ~50% of the ahr enriched regions were devoid of the dre core  <cit> . the lack of a dre core in regions of ahr enrichment was also reported in a ahr genome-wide chip-chip study performed in mouse ch <dig> lx cells  <cit> . chip-seq experiments for other tfs have also demonstrated enrichment in remote genome regions, which may serve important regulatory roles  <cit> . collectively these data suggest the ahr uses different mechanisms to regulate gene expression. moreover, the integration of genome-wide in silico dre search, with de novo motif analysis and tcdd-elicited hepatic temporal gene expression data has further elucidated the hepatic ahr gene regulatory network.

chip-chip analysis identified  <dig>  tcdd-induced ahr regions at  <dig> hrs and  <dig> regions at  <dig> hrs, consistent with the rapid nuclear export and subsequent degradation of the ahr following tcdd activation  <cit> . approximately half of these regions were within intragenic regions . furthermore, 25% of these enriched regions at  <dig> hrs and 19% at  <dig> hrs were within  <dig> kb of a tss, indicating that a large subset of ahr enrichment occurs adjacent to a tss. unlike other studies that report a normal distribution of tf binding centered around the tss  <cit> , the ahr density profile exhibited a cleft immediately adjacent to the tss, possibly to accommodate recruited transcriptional machinery.

although most ahr enrichment regions are intragenic, a significant number are located in distal intergenic regions . studies with the er, p <dig> and forkhead box protein a <dig>  <cit>  suggest distal tf binding may have distinct regulatory roles. binding proximal to the tss is presumed to stabilize the general transcriptional machinery, while distal binding regulates transcription by a looping mechanism or by altering chromatin structure  <cit> . consequently, ahr binding outside of the proximal promoter region may have important regulatory roles that remain largely uninvestigated.

comparing ahr enriched regions with dre cores revealed that their intergenic, intragenic and genic  density distributions were similar. the greatest density of ahr enrichment associated with a dre core occurred within the proximal promoter. both exhibited comparable distribution profiles except for the cleft in enrichment at the tss. the decrease in ahr enrichment at the tss coincides with rna polymerase ii binding at the tsss  <cit>  of transcriptionally responsive genes. although tcdd-elicited differential gene expression is thought to be mediated by the substitution intolerant dre core sequence , only ~50% of the ahr enriched regions contained a dre core, consistent with findings in other promoter targeted ahr chip-chip studies  <cit>  . moreover, relatively few alternative ahr response elements   <cit>  were identified in ahr enriched regions lacking a dre core sequence. enrichment in regions lacking dre cores provides additional evidence of ahr-dna interactions that don not involve the basic bhlh domain  <cit> , such as tethering to other dna interacting tfs and/or tertiary interactions with looping dna.

integration of gene expression, chip-chip, and dre distribution data suggests that ~35% of all differentially expressed hepatic genes are mediated by direct ahr binding to a dre. consequently, 65% of the gene expression responses elicited by tcdd do not involve direct ahr binding to a dre. however, tf binding analyses based on tiling arrays is limited by the extent of probe coverage . genomic regions lacking probe coverage may falsely inflate the number of dre-absent ahr enriched regions, thus underestimating the number of ahr regulated genes involving a dre. furthermore, the analyses may not be exhaustive due to the technical limitations of chip-chip assay coupled with the conservative fdr threshold used to identify statistically significant signals, which may have excluded some positive signals. these limitations of the technology could be addressed in chip-seq experiments, which have greater resolution and sensitivity  <cit> . the shorter sequence reads would improve resolution, but may also identify fewer regions containing a dre. the higher sensitivity of chip-seq could also identify additional regions of ahr enrichment. chip-seq studies could also confirm ahr binding in these genomic regions in either a dre-dependent or -independent manner.

tcdd induces hepatic vacuolization and lipid accumulation with differential gene expression associated with fatty acid metabolism and transport  <cit> . independent functional annotation analysis of differentially expressed genes with significant ahr enrichment using david and ipa identified over-represented processes related to fatty acid and lipid metabolism. computational analysis also identified over-represented binding motifs for tfs involved in the regulation of lipid and cholesterol metabolism, including sites for hnf <dig>  lxr, pxr, ppar and coup-tf. coup-tf is a potent repressor that antagonizes transcriptional responses mediated by other nuclear receptors including hnf <dig>  ppar, er, rar and vdr  <cit> . for example, coup-tf antagonizes hnf4α-mediated responses by binding hnf4α response elements  <cit> . furthermore, ahr interactions with coup-tf repress er-mediated gene expression responses  <cit> . therefore, ahr interactions with coup-tf may regulate lipid and fatty acid metabolism by blocking hnf4α target gene expression . coincidentally, the hnf <dig> binding motif is over represented within ahr enriched regions lacking a dre core.

consistent with this proposed mechanism, several hnf4α regulated genes, including cyp7a <dig> and gck, exhibited ahr enrichment and were repressed by tcdd. cyp7a <dig> is the rate-limiting enzyme in the bile acid biosynthetic pathway that converts cholesterol into bile acids. transgenic mice over-expressing cyp7a <dig> are protected from high-fat diet induced obesity, fatty liver and insulin resistance  <cit> . moreover, a genetic deficiency of cyp7a <dig> in humans results in hyperlipidemia  <cit> . gck phosphorylates glucose in the initial step of glycolysis. mutations in gck that reduce kinase activity are associated with insulin resistance and maturity onset diabetes of young  <dig>  in humans  <cit> . furthermore, mice over-expressing gck are resistant to mody <dig>  <cit> . the down-regulation of cyp7a <dig> and gck, possibly due to ahr - coup-tf interactions at hnf4α response elements, is consistent tcdd-induced hepatic lipid accumulation in mice. interestingly, tcdd exposure has been linked to diabetes and metabolic syndrome in humans  <cit> . studies examining ahr-coup-tf interactions and their effects on hnf <dig> target gene expression are being investigated further.

CONCLUSIONS
this study identified the genome-wide locations of tcdd-induced hepatic ahr enrichment in vivo and incorporates dre distribution and differential gene expression data to further elucidate the hepatic ahr regulatory network. in addition to identifying interactions in regions associated with genes, ahr enrichment in distal non-coding intergenic regions was characterized. the functional significance of these distal interactions is unknown but intergenic binding has been reported for other tfs, and warrants further investigation. moreover, only ~50% of all ahr enriched regions involved a dre, suggesting that indirect ahr binding to dna plays a significant role in the ahr regulatory network.
