BACKGROUND
epilepsy in human is among one of the utmost common brain disorder with 1 % occurrence and characterized by regular and unprovoked seizures due to irregular electric activity in central nervous system   <cit> . until now there are more than  <dig> different epileptic syndromes with wide range of clinical features have been identified. epilepsy can be divided as idiopathic or symptomatic epilepsies. infections, metabolic disorders, brain tumors, head trauma, or stroke are the main reasons of symptomatic epilepsy whereas genetic contributions are the main cause of the idiopathic seizure  <cit> . in human genetics structural changes are largely unexplored area that may be the common factor of epileptic disease  <cit> . these changes include deletions, duplications insertions, inversions, and translocations of dna sequences, and includes copy number differences also known as cnvs  <cit> . recently the development of advanced technologies for genome wide studied such as array-cgh helped to detect minute amplifications and deletion in the chromosomal region  <cit> . cnvs are the most important component of genetic variation and act as important players in the genetic etiology of various neurodevelopmental disorders. cnvs are developing as an important genetic contribution to identify a wide range of epilepsies, such as common new discoveries in epilepsies from genetic generalized epilepsies to the individually rare particular epileptic of encephalopathies  <cit> . the role of cnvs highlighted in the etiology of number of disorders such as intellectual disability   <cit>  autism  <cit> , schizophrenia  <cit>  and epilepsy  <cit> . now a days various free databases for pathogenic and normal genome variations are available on internet and these are exceptionally valuable tools for interpretation of cnvs identified in normal and patients such as database of chromosomal imbalance and phenotype in humans using ensembl resources: decipher and database of genomic variants: dgv;).

in this study, we observed de novo cnvs gain and deletion in a large family with affected mother and five affected kids having intellectual disability, epilepsy and some member with mild intellectual disability nd we hypothesized that genes found within those cnvs would be novel candidate for epilepsy. we are reporting de novo cnvs and the genes cluster in that deleted or amplified region only in the affected members of the family that might be helpful to understand the genetic etiology of epilepsy.

RESULTS
our array-cgh results showed deletion as well as duplication in different genomic regions of effected member of the epileptic patients of the family . in this data, we reported the results of the family with five affected member satisfying the cut off value of gain and deletions . deletion was observed in chromosome  <dig> with cytoband 8p23-p <dig> csmd <dig> gene and copy number gain were observed in the chromosome  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> with lce3c, hpr, gstt <dig> and gsttp <dig> genes respectively. these observed cnv findings were confirmed by using the qpcr analysis.fig.  <dig> a consanguineous family pedigree from saudi arabia with intellectual disability and epilepsy. the available samples for microarray and validation study are marked with asterisks




microarray data showed deleted cnvs
our results of whole genome 2x 400 k oligonucleotide microarray analysis showed deletions 8p <dig>  start  <dig> , <dig> end  <dig> , <dig> in four affected member of the family and important gene in this region name as cub and sushi multiple domains  <dig>  . this gene is large size  similar to csmd <dig> which maps in the region of 8q <dig> and already been associated with mental retardation, autism and to epilepsy .fig.  <dig> array-cgh profiles analysis using agilent cytogenomic analytics software  showing the deletion. zero value indicates equal fluorescence intensity ratio between the sample and reference. copy number losses shifted the ratio toward left , whereas copy number gains towards the right side . cnv deletions observed in the chromosomal regions 8p23-p <dig> in four affected members of the family starts from  <dig> , <dig> end  <dig> , <dig> and the potential gene in this region is csmd <dig> 




the gene csmd <dig> is a unique multiple domain complement-regulatory protein, which is highly expressed in the epithelial tissues and cns and play a role as important regulator of complement initiation and inflammation in the developing.

cns and also play role in the context of growth cone function  <cit> . the deleted region in our patient is at the start of csmd <dig> and all the affected member having the language delay, learning difficulties and epilepsy as shown to be totally deleted  and interrupted by the breakpoint patients with autism and ‘severe language delay’ and learning difficulties reported by  <cit> .

these deletion were confirmed by qpcr which have shown a significant deletions in the gene copy number in affected mother and three kids he same family . we screened ethnically matched healthy control chromosomes  to ensure that the copy number deletions did not represent a normal population, and verified that it was not present outside the family.fig.  <dig> confirmation of deleted and gained cnvs region by using qpcr analysis. the results have shown csmd1gene copy number deletions in the mother and three affected member of the family showed significant fold change as compared to the control




microarray data showed cnvs copy number gain
our results of whole genome 2x 400 k oligonucleotide showed cnvs gain at chromosome  <dig> in the four affected members of the family starts from  <dig> ,879– <dig> , <dig> cytoband 1q <dig>  and the potential gene in this region is lce3c . previously lce deletion was related with psoriasis  <cit>  but no region have been associated with epilepsy or autism. recently, late comified envelope  genes especially the cluster  <dig>  genes mutation influence developing psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis  <cit> . we found this cnv in our four affected individuals and this amplification was not seen in the normal individuals of the family. further, in future analysis will be necessary to determine if this cnv especially the lce3c gene is an epilepsy and autism risk variant in saudi population .fig.  <dig> 
a array-cgh profiles analysis using agilent cytogenomic analytics software . zero value indicates equal fluorescence intensity ratio between the sample and reference. copy number losses shifted the ratio toward left  whereas copy number gains towards the right side . cnvs gain at chromosome  <dig> starts from  <dig> ,879– <dig> , <dig> cytoband 1q <dig>  in the four affected members of the family and the potential gene in this region is lce3c. b our results showed the gain at chromosome  <dig> that starts from  <dig> ,078– <dig> , <dig> cytoband 16q <dig>  in our all four affected members of the family and the potential gene in this region is hpr gene. c our results showed gain at chromosome  <dig> starts  <dig> ,690– <dig> , <dig> cytoband 22q <dig>  and the potential gene cluster in this region are gstt <dig>  gsttp <dig>  gstt2b, gstt <dig>  ddt, and ddtl in all affected members of the family




we also found gain at chromosome  <dig> that starts from  <dig> ,078– <dig> , <dig> cytoband 16q <dig>  in our all five affected members of the family and the potential gene in this region is hpr gene code haptoglobin protein in plasma acts as a scavenger for free heme, and haptoglobin-related protein  . in african-americans hpr gene copy number variation has been reported, where extra copies of the hpr gene have been produced by non-allelic homologous recombination  <cit> .

previously, duplication of hpr gene showed a slight, non-significant under transmission to human african trypanosomiasis-affected children from normal parents in the democratic republic of congo  <cit> . there is no study available that link this gene to epilepsy, intellectual disability and autism so we suggest further investigation of this duplication the saudi population.

our micro array data showed another copy number gain at chromosome  <dig> starts  <dig> ,690– <dig> , <dig> cytoband 22q <dig>  and the gene cluster in this region is gstt <dig>  gsttp <dig>  gstt2b, gstt <dig>  ddt, and ddtl. additional analysis through qpcr confirmed the duplications that has shown a significant fold increase in the gstt <dig>  gsttp <dig>  gstt2b gstt <dig> gene copy number compared to the controls . glutathione s-transferase theta  <dig>  are a member of superfamily of enzymes that play role in both protection from oxidative damage and detoxification  <cit> . in liver they play an important role in metabolizing antiepileptic drugs   <cit> . many aeds produce active metabolites, including epoxides, which might have result on suppression of epileptic spike, but inappropriately, also in systemic toxicity through covalent binding to lipids and proteins  <cit> . glutathione s-transferase  help in catalyzing the conjugation of these metabolites to glutathione, particularly in the elimination of epoxide metabolites that are produced during aeds metabolism. gsts not only help in decreasing their toxicity and helping their excretion from the body, it is expected that gsts may also affect the response to anticonvulsant therapy  <cit> .

previously it has been reported that replication of the 22q <dig>  region associated with schizophrenia  further support the hypothesis that effect of copy number of gstt <dig> may be that the regional structural variation would impact the risk of schizophrenia by altering controlling elements for other genes close to the region. actually, this area shows a high density of segmental duplications and cnv that may impact the expression of surrounding genes in that area  <cit>  furthermore, the discovery of disease linked with gst genes elsewhere in the genome, suggests a direct effect of gstt <dig> gene changes leading to the risk of schizophrenia  <cit> . our microarray data showing the similar information that this region is involved in epilepsy as previously explained  <cit>  duplication at chromosome  <dig> with gene cluster gstt <dig>  gsttp <dig>  gstt2b, gstt <dig>  ddt and ddtl showing the similar phenotypes in our clinical information in the affected member of the family with epilepsy, intellectual disability and also leading to schizophrenia may be the candidate genes for this complex syndrome . these duplications were confirmed by qpcr which have shown a significant increase in the gene copy number in only four patients of the same family .fig.  <dig> 
a, b, c confirmation of cnvs by qpcr have shown a significant fold increase in a
lce3c, b
hpr, and c
gstt <dig> gene copy number in the patients of the family member as compared to the healthy individuals




CONCLUSIONS
in the development of neurological disorders cnvs play important role and may contribute in the genetic etiology of epilepsy. our results showed novel cnvs/genes for the first time in saudi family with six affected member with intellectual disability and epilepsy. our results enhanced the knowledge of the copy number variants underling in epilepsy in saudi population. this could provide a basis for the understanding of the chromosomal region that will be critical in the genome may be involved in the development of epilepsy, intellectual disability and further linked with schizophrenia. further detailed studies and complete clinical information of the patients and identification of possible causative cnvs and genes in the cnv regions using array technology will be obligatory to identify novel syndromes that will help to improve the diagnosis of epilepsy.
