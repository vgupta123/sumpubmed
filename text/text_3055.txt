BACKGROUND
the plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium paenibacillus polymyxa, formerly known as bacillus polymyxa <cit> , can promote plant growth by producing indole-3-acetic acid   <cit>  and volatile compounds  <cit> . it is also known for controlling plant-parasitic nematodes  <cit>  and fungal phytopathogens including fusarium oxysporum <cit> , fusarium graminearum <cit> , aspergillus niger <cit> , penicillium expansum <cit> , leptosphaeria maculans <cit> , phytophthora palmivora and pythium aphanidermatum <cit> . p. polymyxa has been recently used to control bacterial phytopathogens such as xanthomonas campestris <cit> , and x. axonopodis <cit> . the antagonistic effect of p. polymyxa against phytopathogens is mainly due to its capability to produce antimicrobial substances, such as peptide antibiotics and antimicrobial proteins. p. polymyxa can produce several kinds of peptide antibiotics, including polymyxins  <cit> , gavaserin and saltavidin  <cit> , jolipeptin  <cit> , gatavalin  <cit>  and fusaricidins  <cit> .

polymyxins which are known for their strong inhibiting effects against gram-negative bacteria have been used to treat multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria  <cit>  and to prevent septic shock  <cit> . the molecular structure of polymyxin is comprised of a cyclic peptide chain and a hydrophobic tail. each member of polymyxins differs in the structures of fatty acids and the variations in the amino acid residues  <cit> . polymyxins are synthesized by the nonribosomal peptide synthetase  mechanism  <cit> . to date, two giant gene clusters responsible for synthesis of polymyxin a  <cit> , and polymyxin b  <cit>  are known.

among the  <dig> bacterial strains isolated from surface sterilized wheat plants collected from beijing and henan province, china, one strain designated m- <dig> was selected due to its inhibiting effect against fungal phytopathogens. growth of wheat was also enhanced in the presence of this strain indicating its plant growth promoting activity  <cit> . the whole genome of p. polymyxa m- <dig> has been sequenced, and nine giant gene clusters involved in non-ribosomal synthesis of antimicrobial lipopeptides and polyketides have been detected  <cit> . due to its rich spectrum of secondary metabolites with antimicrobial action, p. polymyxa m- <dig> is a good candidate for bio-controlling fire blight, a serious disease in apple and pear caused by erwinia amylovora. previously, we have shown that the polyketide difficidin and the dipeptide bacilysin produced by bacillus amyloliquefaciens suppress growth of e. amylovora <cit> . here, we report that p. polymyxa m- <dig> synthesizes two components of polymyxin p, polymyxin p <dig> and p <dig>  which are efficient against e. amylovora. moreover, the corresponding polymyxin synthetase gene cluster in m- <dig> was identified and further characterized by domain analysis as being different from the pmx gene clusters encoding polymyxin a and b, respectively.

RESULTS
characterization of m-1
culture supernatants of m- <dig> suppressed growth of several bacteria, including the human opportunistic pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa . remarkably, growth of phytopathogenic e. amylovora ea  <dig> and e. carotovora was strongly inhibited . m- <dig> was identified as p. polymyxa by its 16s rdna sequence  and by physiological and biochemical features. the motile, rod-shaped and spore-forming bacterium was facultative anaerobic, was positive in the voges-proskauer reaction , able to hydrolyze starch and to utilize glucose, xylose, glycerol, and mannitol, but did not grow at sodium chloride concentrations exceeding 5%. the whole genome sequence of m- <dig>  displayed close similarity to the sequences of plant-associated p. polymyxa strains sc <dig>  <cit>  and e <dig>  <cit> , respectively.

detection and structural characterization of polymyxin p
the metabolites produced by p. polymyxa m- <dig>  possessing antagonistic activities against e. amylovora ea <dig> and e. carotovora were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry  in combination with bioautography. antibacterial activities were detected in both cell-surface extracts and a gsc culture supernatant of m- <dig>  cell surface extracts were prepared by extraction of cells picked from agar plates with 70% acetonitrile/ <dig> % trifluoroacetic acid  <cit> . by maldi-tof-ms, two prominent series of mass peaks were detected, ranging from m/z =  <dig>  to  <dig>   and from m/z =  <dig>  to  <dig>   , respectively. members of series  <dig> were attributed to the well-known fusaricidins , a family of lipodepsipeptides exhibiting potent antifungal activities  <cit> . the compounds of series  <dig>  were investigated by maldi-tof-ms in more detail. two metabolites were detected, of which the protonated forms showed masses of m/z =  <dig>  and m/z =  <dig> . the other mass peaks of series  <dig> could be attributed to the alkali adducts of these compounds as indicated in figure 2b. their structures were determined by postsource decay -maldi-tof-ms analysis and compared with the fragment spectrum of polymyxin b which was commercially available .

the fragment spectra of both the m- <dig> products of series  <dig> and polymyxin b as the reference revealed the presence of imino ions of threonine  and phenylalanine  as well as dipeptide ions of dab-dab , dab-thr  and dab-phe . the m-1-products and polymyxin b differed in the dipeptide fragments phe-thr   and phe-leu  . these comparative nearest neighbour relationships imply that the compounds of series  <dig> belong to the polymyxin family which are well known antibiotics produced by p. polymyxa. this conclusion was confirmed by fragment analysis using psd-maldi-tof mass spectrometry. figure  <dig> shows the peptide sequence of the m- <dig> metabolite with the mass number of m/z =  <dig>  and the polymyxin b with m/z =  <dig>  as well as of their sodium adducts. in each case the best results were accomplished in mass spectrometric sequencing, when a break of the peptide bond between residue  <dig> and the c-terminus is assumed. the sequence of the resulting linearized peptide follows residues 1– <dig>  the most significant and almost complete sequence information was obtained in the case of the bn – ions, when fragmentation starts between dab <dig> and thr <dig>  for the yn – ions the best results were achieved, when fragmentation begins between thr <dig> and dab <dig>  in this way -dab1-thr2-dab3-dab4-dab5-phe6-thr7-dab8-dab9-thr10- was determined as the peptide sequence of the two m- <dig> – metabolites of series  <dig>  which can be attributed to polymyxin p containing phe, thr and dab in a molecular ratio of  <dig> :  <dig> :  <dig>  <cit> . in this way, these metabolites could be identified as two isomers of polymyxin p, designated as polymyxin p <dig> and p <dig>  the mass spectrum of the reference compound polymyxin b also showed two mass peaks at m/z =  <dig>   and  <dig>  . they were attributed to two variants of polymyxin b differing in their fatty acid component, which is either an iso-octanoyl  or a 6-methyloctanoyl  residue  <cit> . by comparison with polymyxin b and other members of the polymyxin family, we conclude that polymyxin p <dig> and p <dig> from strain m- <dig> contain the same fatty acid residues consistent with the data reported by kimura et al. for polymyxin p  <cit> .

the anti-erwinia activity of polymyxin p produced by p. polymyxa m-1
in order to identify the compounds which suppress the growth of e. amylovora ea <dig> and e. carotovora in m- <dig> gsc culture, the supernatant was subjected to thin layer chromatography  in combination with bioautography  <cit>  . one spot exhibiting antibacterial activity was observed at rf  <dig>   which was identical with that of polymyxin p  <cit> . it was scraped off from the thin layer plate. the silica gel powder obtained was extracted with methanol, and the extract was analyzed by maldi-tof-ms. the obtained mass spectrum ranging from m/z =  <dig> to  <dig>  indicates the same mass peaks at m/z =  <dig> , m/z =  <dig> , m/z =  <dig> , m/z =  <dig>  and m/z =  <dig>  as previously been detected for series  <dig> in figure  <dig>  from these results we conclude, that polymyxin p <dig> and p <dig> represent the active compounds inhibiting growth of the erwinia test strains. there were no mass signals pointing to fusaricidines  or other metabolites showing antibacterial activity . thus, polymyxin p was proven to be an anti-erwinia metabolite which was produced by m- <dig> 

to corroborate these results, a gsc culture supernatant of m- <dig> was fractionated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography  . fifteen fractions were obtained. the fraction appearing at a retention time of  <dig> displayed antagonistic effects against the growth of the two phytopathogenic erwinia indicator strains . this fraction was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry . two peaks were detected at m/z =  <dig>  and m/z =  <dig> , which also correspond to the two isomers of polymyxin p  <cit>  .

morphological changes of erwinia strains caused by treatment with crude polymyxin p
the effect of the crude polymyxin p prepared by rp-hplc described above against two phytopathogenic erwinia strains was studied by scanning electron microscopy . cell surfaces of both untreated e. amylovora ea  <dig> and e. carotovora appeared smooth without any visible irregularities . however, dense projections were observed on cell surfaces of the two phytopathogens treated with crude polymyxin p  or cell- free supernatant prepared from m- <dig> gsc culture  suggesting that polymyxin p caused the same morphological change as m- <dig> gsc culture supernatant did. similar morphological changes were also found on cell surfaces of salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli b  <cit> , chlamydia psittaci <cit>  and pseudomonas aeruginosa treated with polymyxin b or e  <cit> .

the observed morphological changes at the surface of the erwinia cells treated with polymyxin support an action mechanism in which polymyxin, bound at the lipopolysaccharide component of the outer membrane , does permeabilize the om  <cit>  and - as shown here - generates visible protrusions.

characterization of the gene cluster encoding polymyxin biosynthesis in p. polymyxa m-1
the genome of p. polymyxa m- <dig> contains a 41 kb gene cluster displaying overall identities of  <dig> % to the well characterized polymyxin synthetase gene cluster from p. polymyxa e <dig>  <cit>  and of  <dig> % to that from p. polymyxa pkb <dig>  <cit>  on the nucleotide sequence level. corresponding to the pmx gene clusters of e <dig> and pkb <dig>  the m- <dig> gene cluster consisted of five open reading frames, pmxa, pmxb, pmxc, pmxd and pmxe . three of them, the genes pmxa, pmxb and pmxe were directly involved in non-ribosomal peptide synthesis, while pmxc and pmxd were encoding abc transporters .

domain analysis performed with the nrpspredictor <dig> server of the university of tuebingen  <cit>  revealed that the putative polymyxin synthetase of m- <dig> comprises ten modules . each of them consists of three or four domains, such as a-t-c, a-t-e-c or a-t-te. however, similar to the pmx gene clusters in p. polymyxa pkb <dig> and p. polymyxa e <dig>  the order and arrangement of the nrps encoding genes was not collinear with the amino acids in the polymyxin end product. pmxa, a polypeptide containing  <dig> amino acids, comprised four modules. the substrate specificities of the four adenylation domains  were predicted to activate the amino acid substrates d-phe- <dig>  l-thr- <dig>  l-dab- <dig> and l-dab- <dig>  respectively. pmxb, a polypeptide consisting of  <dig> amino acids, contained the remaining part of the last module including a thioesterase domain , a-t-te. the a-domain was predicted to activate l-thr- <dig>  pmxe, a  <dig> amino-acid polypeptide, contained five modules responsible for the first five amino acids of polymyxin p. in addition, a n-terminal condensation domain with similarity to starter c-domain simultaneously acylating the first amino acid with a fatty acid tail was identified  <cit> . the five a-domains were predicted to activate l-dab- <dig>  l-thr- <dig>  d-dab- <dig>  l-dab- <dig>  and l-dab- <dig>  respectively. therefore, the ten modules were arranged in the gene order pmxe-pmxa-pmxb . there were two epimerization domains , occurring in the third and sixth module, which indicated that the third and sixth amino acid of the polymyxin produced by m- <dig> represented d-forms, d-dab and d-phe, respectively. the te-domain located at the carboxy-terminal region of pmxb was probably responsible for terminating polymyxin synthesis by cyclization and releasing the product. the domain organization analysis of the putative polymyxin synthetase from m- <dig> implied that the lipopeptide synthesized by the synthetase is identical with polymyxin p   <cit> , which coincides with the results obtained by mass spectrometric analysis. although there is high overall sequence similarity between the polymyxin gene clusters of m- <dig>  e <dig>  and pkb <dig>  the a domains in modules  <dig> and  <dig> activate different amino acids. the identity between the amino acid sequences of the sixth modules of polymyxin synthetases of m- <dig> and e <dig>  activating phe and leu, respectively, was only 88%. an even lower identity of 51% on the amino acid level was found for the a-domains of the seventh module in the polymyxin synthetases from m- <dig> and pkb <dig>  activating either thr or leu, respectively.

polymyxin antibiotics are lipopeptides, and as in case of the two other known pmx gene clusters, no genes were found in the vicinity of the pmx gene cluster of p. polymyxa m- <dig> which might be involved in lipidation of the peptide moiety. it is likely that polymyxin synthesis resembles surfactin synthesis, and relies upon lipidation functions encoded elsewhere in the chromosome  <cit> . notably, a thioesterase-like gene, pteh , bearing a grst domain and similar to bacillus amyloliquefaciens srfad , was preceding a giant peptide synthetase gene at  <dig> , <dig> in the genome of m- <dig>  however, the pteh protein contains no acyltransferase domain and its role in attaching the fatty acid moiety to the polymyxin dekapeptide remains to be elusive.

discussion
in this study, we found that growth of two important phytopathogens, e. amylovora ea <dig> and e. carotovora was inhibited by m- <dig>  polymyxin p was identified as being the active principle of m- <dig>  two lines of evidence supported this finding:  m- <dig> supernatants formed a distinct clearing spot when exposed to bioautography using the erwinia strains as indicator. when the material isolated from that area was analyzed by maldi-tof mass spectroscopy, the mass peaks with m/z of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  indicating alkali adducts of polymyxin p were detected ;  a single fraction obtained by hplc contained the inhibiting activity against bacterial pathogens and also the characteristic mass peaks m/z were indicating the presence of polymyxin p in this sample .

polymyxin p is a peptide antibiotic reported more than 40 years ago, and two species with different hydroxy fatty acids were described. polymyxin p <dig> contains anteisononanoic acid, a-c <dig>  and polymyxin p <dig> isooctanoic acid, i-c <dig> <cit> . although its constituent amino acids have been determined as being six dab, three thr, and one phe; to the best of our knowledge, no further investigation about the primary structure of polymyxin p and the configuration of the constituent amino acids has been performed until now.

here we established the primary structure of polymyxin p by psd-maldi-tof mass spectrometry . alterations in comparison to other polymyxin species were detected in two out of the four variable positions of the peptide. a unique phe residue resided at the sixth position , and a thr residue was found at the seventh position  of polymyxin p. these results were corroborated by bioinformatic analysis of the polymyxin synthetase gene cluster in m- <dig>  where the adenylation domains specified the amino acid substrates to be activated . the resulting order of amino acids did completely match with the structure for polymyxin p obtained by psd maldi-tof ms . whilst this technique did not deliver information about stereochemical configuration of the amino acid moieties, our bioinformatic approach resulted in detection of two epimerization-domains residing in the third and the sixth module , suggesting the presence of d-dab and d-phe in position  <dig> and  <dig> of the polymyxin product, respectively . the occurrence of d-dab in position  <dig> corresponds with recent findings in polymyxin a  <cit>  and polymyxin b  <cit> . this is remarkable, since according to literature, these forms of polymyxin are rare and the fact that all three of the polymyxin gene clusters examined to date are from plant-associated strains of p. polymyxa isolated for their biocontrol and plant growth promoting activities is relevant for this observation  <cit> .

modules  <dig> and  <dig> contained extra epimerization domains which might convert dab <dig> and phe <dig> to the d-configuration. a-domains in modules  <dig>  and  <dig> specifying different amino acids in the polymyxins produced by m- <dig>  e <dig>  and pkb <dig> are underlined.

CONCLUSIONS
our results support the view that polymyxin p encoded by the pmxabcde gene cluster is the main compound in the culture filtrate of p. polymyxa m- <dig> in suppressing e. amylovora and e. carotovora, the causative agents of the important plant diseases fire blight and soft rot, respectively. since the rare polymyxin p has not been previously used as a clinical agent, in contrast to polymyxin b and colistin  <cit> , this finding provides a potential option to use polymyxin p or its producer strain p. polymyxa m- <dig> as an alternative of chemical bactericides to control fire blight, soft rot and other plant diseases caused by gram-negative bacteria.
