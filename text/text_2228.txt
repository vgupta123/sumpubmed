BACKGROUND
mutation induction is a powerful tool for analysis of gene function and breeding. among the mutagens that have been used to induce mutations, chemical mutagens such as ethyl methane sulfonate , or ionising radiation such as x-rays or γ-rays, have been especially popular in plant science. ems can produce point mutations, mainly g/c-to-a/t transitions, with high frequency  <cit> . such point mutations are easily detected by mutation-detection systems such as the cel <dig> nuclease assay or high-resolution melting curve  analysis  <cit> . in combination with a single-nucleotide polymorphism  detection system, ems-mediated mutagenesis is a powerful reverse genetics approach, called targeted induced local lesions in genomes   <cit> . because of its mutation-inducing property, ems is also very useful for producing leaky alleles in forward genetics. by contrast, x-rays and γ-rays induce dna damage relatively randomly and cause many types of mutations including base substitutions, deletions and chromosomal alterations  <cit> . although x-rays and γ-rays are suitable for production of null mutations, the mutation frequency induced by x-rays and γ-rays is lower than that obtained by ems.

heavy-ion beams are accepted as a novel powerful mutagen because they are able to induce mutations with high frequency at a relatively low dose at which virtually all plants survive, and they induce a broad spectrum of phenotypes without affecting other plant characteristics  <cit> . these characteristics of heavy-ion beams are advantageous for mutation breeding. over  <dig> plant cultivars have been bred with the aid of heavy-ion beams in japan  <cit> . heavy-ion beams comprise accelerated ions produced by an ion accelerator such as a cyclotron or synchrotron. a noted physical characteristic of a heavy-ion beam is that the accelerated particles densely deposit their energy in a localized region along the particle path. this is strikingly different from γ-rays and x-rays, which sparsely deposit their energy in a large targeted volume. the degree of locally deposited energy is represented by the linear energy transfer . whereas the lets of γ-rays and x-rays are  <dig>  and  <dig>  kev μm- <dig>  respectively, the let of a heavy-ion beam for use in biological research ranges from  <dig>  kev μm- <dig> to  <dig> kev μm- <dig> in the riken ri-beam factory   <cit> . it is well known that high-let radiation shows stronger biological effects than low-let radiation. the let of a heavy-ion beam is selectable by ion species, and depends on the characteristics of the ion with respect to electrical charge and velocity. when a high let is required, a heavier and highly charged ion with a low velocity is selected.

based on radiobiological considerations, it has been suggested that heavy-ion beams predominantly induce double-strand breaks   <cit> . a high yield of dsbs after heavy-ion beam irradiation was revealed by experiments on both animal and plant cells  <cit> . therefore, significant dna damage is likely to be caused by heavy-ion irradiation, although sequencing analysis of heavy-ion-induced dna alterations is limited. shikazono et al. reported that about half of the mutations induced by carbon  ions with let of 101- <dig> kev μm- <dig> were small alterations, including base substitutions and comparatively small insertions/deletions , whereas the other half were rearrangements such as translocations, inversions, and comparatively large insertions/deletions   <cit> . these results indicate that heavy-ion irradiation induces a broad range of mutations.

in a previous study, we found that the let value affects the albino-mutant incidence in the m <dig> generation and that  <dig> kev μm- <dig> is the most effective let value in arabidopsis thaliana mutagenesis  <cit> . this high-efficiency let  should be beneficial not only for forward genetics and breeding, but also for reverse genetics  <cit> . however, the mechanisms that contribute to the efficient mutagenesis of letmax irradiation are still unclear. because mutagens such as ems, γ-rays, and heavy-ion beams must be chosen appropriately depending on the experimental purpose or target genes, it is also important to know the nature of mutations induced by c ions with letmax. in the present study, we investigated the relationship between mutation induction and parameters of heavy-ion irradiation, which comprised the number of irradiated ion particles and let. we also determined mutations in knock-out mutants induced by c-ion irradiation with letmax in a. thaliana, as a first step to characterize the nature of c-ion induced mutations.

RESULTS
analysis of particle number and let effects on mutation frequency
to achieve increased mutation efficiency with heavy-ion irradiation, the effects of both the number of irradiated ion particles and the let value should be studied. the number of ion particles could determine the number of dsbs per cell nucleus, while the let value might affect the efficiency of dsb induction . in a previous study, we found that c-ion irradiation with letmax induced a three-fold higher mutation frequency than that with  <dig>  kev μm- <dig>  <cit> . to confirm the effect of both let and particle number more precisely, c-ion irradiation was applied at doses that ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> gy; the survival percentage in the m <dig> generation and albino incidence in the m <dig> generation were measured. the number of ion particles per cell nucleus was calculated based on the assumptions that seeds have a specific density of  <dig> and the size of the nucleus is  <dig> μm <dig> . the dose  is proportional to the let  and the number of irradiated particles. the effect of c ions with let of  <dig>  kev μm- <dig> on survival percentage was greater than that at let of  <dig>  kev μm- <dig> . for c ions with let of  <dig>  kev μm- <dig>  about  <dig>  particles per  <dig> μm <dig> were needed to cause lethality, whereas at  <dig>  kev μm- <dig> over  <dig>  particles per  <dig> μm <dig> were required. the let value had a more striking effect on the mutation frequency in the m <dig> generation than the m <dig> generation . carbon ions with let of  <dig>  kev μm- <dig> produced a  <dig> % albino incidence at the most effective particle number . by contrast, c ions with let of  <dig>  kev μm- <dig> produced only a  <dig> % albino incidence, even at the most effective particle number . the difference in let effect on mutation frequency between  <dig>  kev μm- <dig> and  <dig>  kev μm- <dig> was obvious, especially under irradiation with over  <dig>  particles, which indicated that the particle number is also important to obtain a high mutation frequency. these findings indicate that c ions with let of  <dig>  kev μm- <dig> have a different mutational effect from those with  <dig>  kev μm- <dig> and raise the question as to what dna alterations are caused by these irradiation conditions.

confirmation of mutation efficiency of c ions with letmax
the elongated hypocotyl  and glabrous  mutants were screened in the m <dig> generation after c-ion irradiation under three conditions: let of  <dig>  kev μm- <dig> at a dose of  <dig> gy ,  <dig>  kev μm- <dig> at a dose of  <dig> gy , and  <dig>  kev μm- <dig> at a dose of  <dig> gy . mutation frequencies and the structure of mutated dnas in these conditions were compared. the hy and gl mutants are well characterised and the genes responsible for the respective phenotypes have been determined  <cit> . consequently, these mutants have been used previously for similar mutated dna analyses  <cit> . screening of  <dig>  m <dig> plants revealed that  <dig> mutants were induced by c ions with let of  <dig>  kev μm- <dig> at a dose of  <dig> gy. the mutation frequency with  <dig>  kev μm- <dig> was approximately two-fold higher than that in the other irradiation conditions . these results support the preceding data in which c ions with let of  <dig>  kev μm- <dig> were more effective for mutation induction than those with  <dig>  kev μm- <dig>

characterisation of mutated dna structure caused by c-ion irradiation
to investigate the structure of mutated dna in the isolated mutants caused by c-ion irradiation, dna from the isolated mutants was subjected to hrm, pcr, and sequencing analyses using primers specific for the genes responsible for the hy and gl phenotypes . among the  <dig> hy and gl mutants isolated,  <dig> independent mutant lines were identified. this is because mutants isolated from the same batch were thought to have originated from the same m <dig> plants. to confirm that all mutants classified in the same mutant line had an identical dna mutation, all of the mutants derived from the same batch were confirmed by pcr and sequencing analysis. because the number of identified mutant lines was limited, the following mutants were also included in the characterisation of the dna mutations: altered meristem program   <dig>  pinoid   <dig>  and yellow variegated   <dig>   <cit> .

the identified dna mutations are listed in table  <dig>  in total,  <dig> mutations were identified. mutations of  <dig> of the  <dig> independent hy and gl mutant lines were determined successfully. in addition, two mutations in the amp <dig> gene, two mutations in the pid <dig> gene, and one mutation in the var <dig> gene were identified. the c-ion-induced mutations consisted of base substitutions, deletions, insertions, and translocations. of the  <dig> alleles, only four showed rearrangements, including translocations and a large deletion; these were detected in high-dose irradiated mutants . eighteen mutants had base substitutions or deletions/insertions less than  <dig> bp . of the four alleles with a base substitution, three were transversions and one was a transition. among these, only one allele  had a missense mutation , whereas the other alleles had nonsense mutations that resulted in production of c-terminally truncated proteins. in total,  <dig> alleles were null mutants. whether the c-27-gl <dig> allele was a null mutation was not elucidated, although the phenotype of the c-27-gl <dig> mutant was similar to that of a null mutant of gl <dig> . the size and type of mutations induced by  <dig>  kev μm- <dig> and  <dig>  kev μm- <dig> let did not differ. these results indicated that c ions with lets of  <dig>  or  <dig>  kev μm- <dig> mainly caused small alterations and that most of the induced mutants were null mutants.

two reciprocal translocations and one complex rearrangement were detected . for the complex rearrangement , only one breakpoint at the ttg <dig> gene was detected by tail-pcr. the other possible irradiation-induced breakpoints in the mutant could not be determined by any pcr analysis. however, five breakpoints were identified successfully in the mutants with rearrangements. of the five breakpoints, four contained deletions , one had no deletion, and none had duplications . these five breakpoints were repaired, which resulted in six rejoined sites. half of the rejoined sites showed short regions of sequence homology , whereas the other half had inserted dna fragments , termed filler dna  <cit> . fourteen rejoining sites of simple deletions are listed in table  <dig>  eight of these rejoined sites showed 1- <dig> bp microhomology.

discussion
in this study, we characterised the mutation frequencies and structure of mutated dnas in knock-out mutants caused by c-ion irradiation with let of  <dig>  kev μm- <dig> or  <dig>  kev μm- <dig> . the mutation frequency for c-ions with let of  <dig>  kev μm- <dig> was higher than that for c ions at  <dig>  kev μm- <dig>  as indicated by frequencies of albino mutants  and hy and gl mutants . although the number of mutants identified is too small for accurate statistical analysis, the hy and gl mutation frequencies induced by c ions with let of  <dig> kev μm- <dig> are similar to that induced by ems  and  <dig> -fold higher than that induced by x-rays   <cit> . by contrast, the structure of mutated dna induced by c ions with let of  <dig>  kev μm- <dig> or  <dig>  kev μm- <dig> was almost identical. in both cases, over 80% of the determined mutations were small alterations and the remainder were rearrangements . the proportion of large genetic alterations that followed repair of irradiation-induced damage might be higher than that observed in this study because a large alteration affecting an essential gene might not be transmitted to the m <dig> generation  <cit> . twenty-one of the  <dig> mutated dnas characterised were null mutations since these mutations cause a frameshift or a nonsense mutation. the actual proportion of base substitutions induced by irradiation might be higher than that detected in this study, because some might represent silent mutations that could not be identified in the current screening. base substitutions and small deletions/insertions were detectable by the cel <dig> nuclease assay or hrm analysis. indeed, most of the mutations identified in this study were determined by hrm . from our results, we suggest that c-ion irradiation at letmax can be used for effective tilling to obtain null mutants.

mutagens must be selected according to the experimental purpose or target genes. carbon-ion irradiation has potential advantages for several aspects of mutagenesis. first, c-ion irradiation is more practical to administer than ems. ems treatment of tissues or plantlets is sometimes time-consuming because of its penetration capability. on the other hand, the irradiation times required with c-ions are short; only a few seconds irradiation is needed for imbibed seeds, tissues, and plantlets, or a few minutes for dry seeds. indeed, by irradiation of tissue cultures or plantlets with c-ion beams, over  <dig> novel cultivars in diverse plant species have been produced. second, c-ion irradiation may be advantageous in the induction of truncation mutants rather than generation of allelic series, because our data indicated that small indel mutations occurred more frequently than base-change mutations. to generate an allelic series, ems induction of base substitutions is useful. finally, c-ion irradiation might have potential to induce deletions with desired sizes by selection of an appropriate let value . to clarify the beneficial characteristics of mutation induction by c-ion irradiation, whole-genome investigation of mutations such as missense and silent mutations is needed.

the proportion of small alterations, such as base substitutions or small deletions/insertions and rearrangements, induced by c ions with let of  <dig>  kev μm- <dig> or  <dig>  kev μm- <dig> is more similar to that induced by low-let radiation  than that induced by c ions at 101- <dig> kev μm- <dig> let . similar proportions were reported in irradiation experiments on transgenic mice, in which c ions with let of  <dig>  kev μm- <dig> preferentially induced small alterations , as did γ-rays   <cit> . suzuki et al. reported that the proportions of large and small deletions differed between c ions with lets of  <dig> kev μm- <dig> and  <dig> kev μm- <dig> in an irradiation experiment on human cells  <cit> . these data indicate that c ions with moderate let  might have different effects on dna alterations from c ions with let of 101- <dig> kev μm- <dig>  however, the structure of breakpoints was similar between the current study  and a previous study   <cit> . in the present study, five of the six breakpoints of rearrangements had deletions, whereas no breakpoint contained a duplication . a previous study revealed that the breakpoints induced by c ions with let of 101- <dig> kev μm- <dig> preferentially have deletions , whereas the breakpoints induced by electrons tend to have duplications   <cit> . these results imply that the process of dsb production and repair after irradiation with c ions with lets of  <dig>  kev μm- <dig> or  <dig>  kev μm- <dig> might be similar to those with 101- <dig> kev μm- <dig>  therefore,  <dig>  kev μm- <dig> appears to represent a moderate let between low-let radiation and 101- <dig> kev μm- <dig> 

* small alterations comprise 1- <dig> bp deletions/insertions and base substitutions. rearrangements comprise deletions/insertions exceeding  <dig> bp, translocations, reciprocal translocations and inversions.

previously, we had no clear answer to the question of why c ions with  <dig> kev μm- <dig> let can induce a higher mutation frequency than other let values. the current study showed no difference in the structure of mutated dnas between c-ion irradiation at  <dig>  kev μm- <dig> and  <dig> kev μm- <dig>  thus, the dsb repair process in both conditions might be the same, although the possibility of existence of a let-dependent dna repair pathway cannot be excluded. one possible explanation for the difference in mutation frequencies between these irradiation conditions is the difference in the efficiency of dsb production. although the number of irradiated particles with let of  <dig>  kev μm- <dig> was larger than that with  <dig>  kev μm- <dig>   <dig>  kev μm- <dig> did not induce a higher mutation frequency than  <dig>  kev μm- <dig> . therefore, it is likely that  <dig>  kev μm- <dig> c ions induced dsbs more effectively than  <dig>  kev μm- <dig> c ions. with regard to c ions with let values exceeding  <dig>  kev μm- <dig>  the mutation frequency was not higher than that of letmax   <cit> . under these irradiation conditions, the particle number might not be sufficient to produce the same mutation effect as that with let of  <dig> kev μm- <dig>  for example, with irradiation of  <dig>  particles per  <dig> μm <dig> at  <dig>  kev μm- <dig>  the absorbed dose reached about  <dig> gy, at which point the m <dig> plants could not survive  <cit> . collectively, our results indicate that both an appropriate let value and an adequate particle number might be needed to obtain the highest mutation efficiency with heavy-ion beam irradiation.

alternatively, the difference in dsb qualities might be a possible explanation for the let-dependent difference in mutation induction efficiency between  <dig>  kev μm- <dig> and  <dig>  kev μm- <dig>  monte carlo calculations indicate that high-let radiation induces a higher fraction of complex dsbs than low-let radiation  <cit>  and complex dsbs are difficult to repair  <cit> . the data from the monte carlo calculations are in good accordance with experimental measurements of the higher yield of short dna fragments after high-let irradiation in both animals and plants  <cit> . therefore, it is likely that the quality of dsbs induced by c ions with let of  <dig>  kev μm- <dig> might be slightly more complex than that induced by c ions with let of  <dig>  kev μm- <dig>  and that the complex dsbs might be difficult to repair, although more-detailed theoretical and experimental data with lets around  <dig>  kev μm- <dig> are required to clarify this hypothesis.

the current data indicate that the structures of mutated dna caused by c-ion irradiation with lets of  <dig>  kev μm- <dig> or  <dig>  kev μm- <dig> differed from those induced by c-ion irradiation with let of 101- <dig> kev μm- <dig>  in mesorhizobium loti, irradiation by iron ions  induced larger deletions compared with deletions induced by c ions   <cit> . these results raise the possibility that the structure of mutated dna might be controlled by selection of an appropriate let value. to achieve this, further experimental data under irradiation conditions with different lets is needed as well as theoretical analysis of the quality of dsbs.

CONCLUSIONS
c ions at letmax showed higher mutation efficiency than those with let of  <dig>  kev μm- <dig>  with an efficiency that appears similar to that with ems. to achieve such efficiency with heavy-ion beam irradiation, both let and particle number must be optimised. in arabidopsis,  <dig>  kev μm- <dig> at  <dig> gy  was the most effective dose. c ions at letmax and  <dig>  kev μm- <dig> predominantly induced null mutations. over 80% of the null mutations were base substitutions or small deletions/insertions, which can be detected by snp detection systems such as the cel <dig> nuclease assay or hrm analysis. it is concluded that c ions with let of  <dig>  kev μm- <dig> might be suitable as a powerful tilling technology in conjunction with a snp detection system to produce null mutants.
