BACKGROUND
bruton’s tyrosine kinase , a member of the btk/tec family of protein tyrosine kinases , is a cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinases  . it is closely involved regulating survival, activation, proliferation in signal transduction pathways, and differentiation of b-lineage lymphoid cells . mutations in the human btk gene are responsible for x-linked agammaglobulinemia , a male immunodeficiency that causes shortage of mature b cells and serum immunoglobulin . btk has two regulatory tyrosine residues  that participate in kinase activation  <cit> . btk is initially activated by trans-phosphorylation of tyr- <dig> on activation loop followed by stimulating autophosphorylation of the tyr- <dig> residue within ligand binding site in sh <dig> domain . btk is important for b-cell development, differentiation, and signaling .

btk inhibitors are still ongoing in clinical evaluation to identify their use of treating autoimmune diseases. many btk inhibitors such as hm <dig>  ono- <dig>  spebrutinib, cc- <dig>  avl- <dig> and rn- <dig> have been reported. recently, btk inhibitor ibrutinib  was approved by fda for treating mantle cell lymphoma  and chronic lymphocytic leukemia  <cit> . this makes it as a potential therapeutic target. our computational research group has been involved in molecular modeling studies .

in the present study, we performed a molecular modeling study combining molecular docking; molecular dynamics , molecular mechanics poisson-boltzmann surface area  calculations, and three-dimensional structure-activity relationship  analysis to find the binding mode of btk inhibitors and to identify the important key residues that participate in inhibition of btk. we have developed receptor-guided 3d-qsar models. the docking results can help to understand the binding process. energy calculations and energy decomposition were used to study the contribution of each active site residues in inhibition of btk kinase. furthermore, 3d-qsar results can provide structural insights to design more active compounds of this series and to develop novel btk inhibitors.

methods
collection of dataset
a total of  <dig> thienopyridine-4-amines inhibitors of bruton’s tyrosine kinase reported by xiang et al. was taken for the study  <cit> . the experimental ic <dig> values were converted into pic <dig>  values which were used as dependent variables in the current qsar analyses. all the compounds were sketched using sybyl x  <dig>   <cit>  and the energy optimization is done using tripos force field. mmff <dig> charges were applied as partial charges. the compounds in the dataset are divided into  <dig> test sets and  <dig> training sets. the test set compounds were selected randomly but, it is ensured that they contain compounds in uniformly distributed range of values from low activity to high active compounds. the pic <dig> values are from  <dig>  to  <dig> , covering an interval of more than  <dig> log units which is fit for 3d qsar studies  <cit> . the most active molecule  from the dataset was docked into the active site of btk kinase. this docked pose was selected as a template structure to sketch the rest of the molecules in the dataset. the complete dataset taken for this study is shown in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

modeling of missing residues
the recent high-resolution crystal structure of bruton’s tyrosine kinase was retrieved from the protein data bank   <cit> . the residues from loop region 552– <dig> were reported missing in crystal structure. this region was modeled and refined using modellerv <dig>  . after the loop refinement, the best loop conformation was selected based on low-energy, ga <dig>  <cit>  and dope  <cit>  score. this structure was taken as an initial structure for docking and molecular dynamics.

molecular docking
autodock  <dig>  <cit>  was used for performing docking calculations. the active site residues of bruton’s tyrosine kinase were reported in previous studies  <cit> . the residues around 4 Å of the co-crystallized ligand were considered as the binding site for docking studies. the most active compound  from the dataset was docked into the active site of btk. the protein structure was prepared by removing water, adding kollman charges and polar hydrogen. the torsion of the ligand was prepared by limiting the number of rotatable bond to  <dig>  the grid maps were generated by the auxiliary program autogrid <dig>  using x, y and z coordinates of the active site. the grid dimensions were set to 70 × 70 ×  <dig> points with a grid spacing of  <dig>  Å. the number of docking runs was set to  <dig>  the population in the genetic algorithm was  <dig>  after docking, the  <dig> docked poses were clustered into groups with rms deviations lower than  <dig>  Å. a pose ranked by the lowest energy on the cluster was selected as the docked conformation. this docked conformation of the most active compound  <dig> was used in 3d qsar studies and molecular dynamics.

alignment
molecular alignment of compounds is a crucial step in the development of 3d-qsar models  <cit> . the alignment was achieved by taking the docked pose of compound  <dig> as the template. it was assumed that each molecule binds to the active site in a similar mode, as they share a common scaffold. the statistics of the model depends on the alignment of the molecules in its bioactive conformation  <cit> . during the procedure, all the dataset compounds are aligned to the template common substructure using the substructure-alignment function in sybylx <dig> .

comfa and comsia studies
the comfa and comsia models were generated using sybylx  <dig> . in comfa  <cit> , the steric and electrostatic fields were calculated separately using sp <dig> carbon as the probe atom with the energy cutoff values of 30 kcal/mol. models were generated using default parameters. to generate statistically significant 3d-qsar models, partial least squares  regression was used. it evaluates the training set by correlating the variation in their pic <dig> values with variations in their comfa/comsia descriptor fields. to analyze the reliability of the models generated from pls analysis, cross-validation analysis was accomplished with the leave-one-out  methodology. then, a non cross-validation analysis was carried out using the obtained optimal number of components by cross-validation; the pearson coefficient  and standard error of estimates  were calculated.

in comparative molecular similarity indices analysis   <cit> , steric, electrostatic, hydrophobic, and hydrogen bond  donor and acceptor descriptors were calculated using a probe atom of radius  <dig> . an attenuation factor of  <dig>  was used. comsia models with different combinations were generated. from these developed models, a statistically reasonable comsia model in terms of q
 <dig>  r
 <dig> and see was selected.

3d-qsar model validation
to evaluate the real predictive ability of the models generated by the comfa/comsia analyses, various validation techniques were used. all the models are tested for stability and robustness with external test set validation, leave-five-out , a  <dig> run of bootstrapping, progressive scrambling, rm
 <dig> metric calculations, slope k and concordance correlation coefficient. the progressive scrambling of  <dig> runs with  <dig> to  <dig> bins was performed to validate the models  <cit> . finally, the comfa/comsia results were graphically represented by field contour maps using the field type ‘stdev*coeff’. in contour maps, molecular fields such as steric, electrostatic, hydrophobic, donor and acceptor fields define the favorable or unfavorable regions of aligned molecules suggesting the modification required to increase the activity of the inhibitors or to design new molecules.

molecular dynamics simulation
the docked structure of 5bq <dig> with compound  <dig> served as a starting structure for md simulations using gromacs  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  package. amber99sb force field  <cit>  was used for the protein. the force field parameters for compound  <dig> was generated by the general amber force field   <cit>  using the acpype program  <cit> . the complex was solvated in a rectangular box of tip3p water  <cit> , a minimum distance of  <dig> Ǻ between the solute and the box. sodium ions were added to the system by random replacement of water molecules to neutralize the system. long-range coulomb interactions were handled using the particle mesh ewald  method  <cit> . the energy minimization of the whole system was carried out for  <dig>  steps with steepest descent method followed by a short nvt equilibration in constant temperature of 300 k for 100 ps using berendsen thermostat  <cit> . the system then equilibrated with npt with constant pressure of 1 atm for 100 ps. to keep the bonds constrained, lincs algorithm  <cit>  was used. a production run for 5 ns was performed using npt ensemble at 300 k and  <dig>  atm pressure with a time step of 2 fs. coordinate trajectories were recorded every 2 ps for the whole md runs.

binding free energy calculation
free energy calculations were performed on the md trajectory using g_mmpbsa  <cit> . free energy was calculated for each snapshot and for each molecular species . the binding free energy is computed by eq.  <dig>  the molecular mechanics energy  was calculated by the electrostatic and van der waals interactions. solvation free energy  was composed of the polar and the non-polar contributions. non-polar solvation free energy was determined using solvent accessible surface area  model while, polar solvation free energy was obtained by solving the poisson-boltzmann equation for mm/pbsa method. furthermore, the binding free energies were decomposed to a single residue using mm/pbsa method tΔs represented the entropy term:  <dig> Δgbind=Δgmm+Δgsol−tΔs..... 


RESULTS
molecular docking
the docking of the most active compound  <dig> was carried out using autodock  <dig>  the docking produced  <dig> conformations. the clusters were analyzed and a docked conformation based on the binding energy, hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interaction was selected. the selected conformation exhibited a binding energy of − <dig>  kcal/mol. the binding pocket of btk kinase is mainly contributed by residues leu <dig>  ala <dig>  lys <dig>  met <dig>  thr <dig>  glu <dig>  met <dig>  ser <dig>  asp <dig> and phe <dig>  <cit> . the docked conformation of compound  <dig> with btk kinase is shown in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> the binding conformation and hydrogen bonding interactions of compound  <dig> in the active site of btk. hydrogen bonds are represented as yellow dotted lines and their distances are labeled in angstrom




it was found that compound  <dig> was favorably located in the btk binding pocket. the amino group of thienopyridine formed two hydrogen bond with hinge residues thr <dig> and glu <dig>  thr <dig> is a gatekeeper residue of the btk kinase and hence this interaction is crucial. additionally, nitrogen atom of thienopyridine formed a hydrogen bond with met <dig> of btk kinase. these three hydrogen bond interaction has been reported in the previous studies  <cit>  and are reported critical for maintaining the btk inhibitory activity  <cit> . furthermore, a hydrogen bond between the oxygen atom of phenoxyphenyl group and active site residue asp <dig> was observed. pi-cation interaction between lys <dig> and first phenyl ring of phenoxyphenyl group attached to the thieno  pyridine was found. hydrophobic interaction of pyrazol ring with leu <dig> and second phenyl ring of phenoxyphenyl group with residues met <dig>  val <dig> and leu <dig> were identified. based on the polar and hydrophobic interactions formed, the selected docked conformation is considered efficient and was used for the receptor-guided qsar studies.

comfa and comsia study
receptor-guided comfa models were developed for series of thieno  pyridine-4-amine derivatives as btk antagonist. the docked conformation of the most active compound  <dig> was taken as the template to sketch and align the rest of the dataset molecules. the common substructure and alignment of the dataset are shown in additional file 2: figure s <dig> and additional file 3: figure s <dig>  respectively. the data set was divided into  <dig> training and  <dig> test set compounds. the compounds for external test set validation were categorized into most active, moderately active, and least active compounds based on the biological activity. both the test and training set contains compounds of all three activity levels.

to find the reliability of a qsar model, statistical parameters such as cross-validated correlation coefficient , non cross-validated correlation coefficient , and standard error of estimate , optimum number of components  and f statistical values should be evaluated. a reasonable comfa model  was developed for the selected training and test sets. different combinations of comsia descriptors were used to generate models. the detailed values of each generated model are given in additional file 4: table s <dig>  among the all the combination of the comsia descriptors, steric , electrostatic , hydrophobic , hydrogen-bond acceptor  and hydrogen-bond donor  sehad yielded the most robust comsia model . the detailed statistical summary of the comfa and comsia analysis are tabulated in table  <dig> table  <dig> detailed statistical summary of the comfa and comsia models

model validation of comfa and comsia models
the following validation techniques were used to calculate the robustness of the developed models. the values of leave five out, external test set , bootstrapping, progressive scrambling  and rm
 <dig> metric calculation for comfa and comsia models were within the suggested range  <cit> . furthermore, ccc value for the comfa and comsia models found to be substantial according to gramatica et al.  <cit> . the validation results show that the selected models were robust and predictable. as shown in table  <dig>  the comsia 3d-qsar models have a better statistical result. therefore, we focus on the sehad model in the following discussion. the experimental and predicted activity values for the developed models were tabulated in additional file 5: table s <dig>  the scatter plot for the same is shown in additional file 6: figure s <dig> 

contour map analysis
the contour map for the comsia model with sehad combination is shown in fig.  <dig>  the most potent compound  <dig> of the dataset is shown superimposed with comsia contour map inside btk kinase. in the steric contour map, green contours represent sterically favorable regions where bulky substituent increases the activity. the yellow contours indicate sterically unfavorable region where bulky substituent decreases the activity . a big green contour seen near the pyrazole ring of at r <dig> position suggests that bulky substitution is favored in this region. longer bulky substitution in this position could enhance the activity. this could possibly the reason for higher activity of compounds  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and the most active compound  <dig> which contains long bulkier substitution at this position. bulky substitution in this position could interact with leu <dig>  interaction of the ligand with leu <dig> has been reported in previous studies on btk inhibitors. a yellow contour near the ethynyl group of r <dig> position suggests that bulky substitution in this region could decrease the activity.fig.  <dig> comsia stdev*coeff contour maps. a steric contour map ; b electrostatic contour map ; c hydrophobic contour map ; d h-bond acceptor map . e h-bond donor map . compound  <dig> is shown as ball and stick model inside the active site of btk kinase




in the electrostatic map, blue contours represent regions where substitutions increase the activity while red contours indicate regions where electronegative substitutions increase the activity . a blue contour near the ethynyl group at r <dig> position implies that positive substitution in that region could increase the activity of the inhibitor. the red contour on the pyrazole ring of r <dig> position suggests that negative atoms in that position could help in increasing the activity of the ligand. this could be the reason for high activity of compounds  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> including the most active compound  <dig> that possess nitrogen  atoms in pyrazole ring with positive substitution at the end . presence of negative atom at this position could make polar contact with leu <dig>  this could be the reason for the least activity of compounds  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> which doesn’t possess pyrazole ring or negative atoms at the r <dig> position.

the hydrophobic contour map from comsia is shown in fig. 2c. cyan contours indicate the regions where hydrophobic groups are favored. a cyan contour near the pyrazole ring at r <dig> position indicates that hydrophobic groups near the pyrazole ring are favored. this could be proved with our docking interaction where the r <dig> substituent formed a hydrophobic contact with leu <dig>  another big cyan contour is seen near the phenoxyphenyl substituent of the r <dig> group. this region is a hydrophobic pocket. these interactions are also can be correlated with our docking results. phenoxyphenyl of the ligand occupied a deep position in hydrophobic pocket constituted by residues met <dig>  val <dig>  ile <dig> and leu <dig>  hence compounds possessing aromatic  substitution at this position hold higher activity levels. this scenario can be observed in nearly all the moderate and highly active compounds.

the h-bond acceptor comsia contour map is shown in fig. 2d. the magenta color signifies regions that favor h-bond acceptor groups whereas, grey color signifies the opposite. the magenta color contour near the nitrogen atom of pyrazole ring at the r <dig> position indicates that the presence of hydrogen bond acceptor group in this position could help in increased activity. compounds having acceptor group  at this position could form a hydrogen bond with residues leu <dig>  this could be validated by the presence of nitrogen atom as hydrogen bond accepting groups in most of the highly active compounds  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> including the most active molecule of our dataset compound  <dig>  the grey color atom near the phenoxyphenyl group at r <dig> position indicates that hydrogen bond accepting groups at the position decreases the activity.

the h-bond donor comsia contour map is shown in fig. 2e. the orange contours signify regions favoring hydrogen bond-donor groups, whereas the purple contours signify regions unfavorable for hydrogen bond-donor groups. an orange contour r <dig> position depicts that presence of donor group atoms in that substituents could increase the activity of inhibitors. the presence of hydrogen bond donor groups at these specific positions could form hydrogen bond with leu <dig> and met <dig>  the hydrogen bond formation of btk inhibitors with leu <dig> has been reported in many previous studies including the one our group published with a series of diaminopyrimidine derivatives as btk inhibitors  <cit> .

molecular dynamics simulation
md simulations of 5 ns were performed to investigate the binding mode and to test the stability of the docked conformation of compound  <dig>  the standard md analysis on potential energy, temperature and pressure for the system are given in additional file 7: figures s4-s <dig>  the root mean square deviation  of the atomic positions with respect to the starting structure was calculated . the rmsd plot shows that the system had reached a converged state after  <dig>  ns for the protein and less than 1 ns for the ligand after which they maintain stability. the active site residues remain stable with much less deviation. the plot of the root mean square fluctuation  of the system is shown in additional file 8: figure s <dig>  the rmsf was plotted from  <dig> to 5 ns. presence of peaks indicates the areas fluctuates the most during the simulation. the fluctuations observed are around  <dig>  nm and less than  <dig>  nm which signifies the stability of the system. the radius of gyration determines the compactness of the system and it shows the stability of the protein during the simulation. the radius of gyration is seen as a plateau throughout the simulation indicating protein stability .fig.  <dig> rmsds of cα atoms of the protein, active site and compound  <dig> in 5 ns md simulation




analysis of md results showed three hydrogen bond formations with active site residues the <dig>  glu <dig> and met <dig>  this is consistent with our docking results except for additional hydrogen bond with asp <dig> was observed in the docked conformation. apart from the hydrogen bond interactions, hydrophobic contact of pyrazole ring with leu <dig> was observed. the phenoxyphenyl group was deeply buried in the hydrophobic pocket formed by val <dig>  ser <dig>  leu <dig> and asp <dig>  this result is also consistent with our docking results. to study the stability of these interactions, hydrogen bond with these four residues were monitored throughout the 5 ns simulation . hydrogen bond interaction with residues thr <dig>  glu <dig> and met <dig> were stable throughout the simulation whereas, interaction with asp <dig> was weak. to further study the reason behind it, docked conformation of compound  <dig>  was superimposed with the structure obtained at 5 ns . the final md structure showed that conformation of the phenoxyphenyl group slightly changed and moved away from asp <dig> fig.  <dig> change evaluated in terms of distance between crucial active site residues and compound  <dig>  a distance between oxygen atom of thr <dig> and h <dig> of compound 26; b distance between oxygen atom of glu <dig> and h <dig> of compound 26; c distance between oxygen atom of met <dig> and n <dig> of compound 26; d distance between hydrogen atom of asp <dig> and o <dig> of compound 26

free energy calculation using mm/pbsa
the binding affinity of compound  <dig> was calculated using mm/pbsa method. the predicted binding free energy is − <dig>  kj/mol. it composed of van der waal energy of − <dig>  kj/mol, electrostatic energy of − <dig>  kj/mol, polar solvation energy of  <dig>  kj/mol and sasa energy of − <dig>  kj/mol. van der waals energy and non-polar salvation energy are vital for the binding of the inhibitor with btk. on the other hand, polar solvation energy is unfavorable for the binding of the inhibitor. this shows the significance of the intermolecular van der waal’s contribution. this is consistent with the docking study and md simulation interactions, where the large interaction of ligand with the hydrophobic binding pocket was observed. to understand the protein-ligand interaction in detail, decomposition of the binding free energy was performed. the energy decomposition analysis showed that the main contribution of binding is from residues, leu <dig>  gly <dig>  asp <dig>  cys <dig> and ser <dig> with − <dig> , − <dig> , − <dig> , − <dig> , − <dig>  and − <dig>  kj/mol respectively . it is revealed that residue thr <dig>  lys <dig>  leu <dig> and ala <dig> are in disfavor with the binding of compound  <dig>  overall, the binding free energy analysis explained the binding mechanism with the list of residues that favors the binding of compound  <dig> to btk kinase.fig.  <dig> energy of each residue contribution to the binding of compounds  <dig> with btk kinase




CONCLUSIONS
inhibition of btk kinase has emerged as a new promising target in the field of b cell malignancies and autoimmunity or allergy/hypersensitivity as it is involved in several signaling pathways. in this study, an attempt was made to understand the binding mechanism and to get an insight on important residues that are crucial to inhibit btk kinase. the most active molecule of the dataset, compound  <dig> was docked into the binding site of btk kinase. our docking results were consistent with the results of other studies. the molecular dynamic simulation and mm/pbsa calculations confirmed that the docked conformation is reliable. free energy calculations showed that van der waal interaction provided the most substantial force for the binding of the inhibitor. the decomposition of binding free energy revealed that residues leu <dig>  gly <dig>  asp <dig>  cys <dig> and ser <dig> contributed favorably to the binding of compound  <dig>  hydrogen bond interactions with thr <dig>  gly <dig>  met <dig> and asp <dig> were observed during docking and md simulations.

a reasonable receptor-guided comfa and comsia models were developed. based on the statistical performance comsia model was selected as the final model. the contour map analysis suggests that bulky substitution is favored at r <dig> position. negative substitutions and hydrogen bond acceptors are preferred near the pyrazole ring at the r <dig> position. hydrophobic or aromatic substitutions are highly favored near the phenoxyphenyl substituent at r <dig> position. bulky positive substituents with hydrogen bond donor properties are preferred near ethynyl group at r <dig> position. there is a good correlation between the docking results, md results and contour map analysis. this proves that the developed comsia model is robust and predictable. our results could be a good start for the rational design of more potent and novel btk kinase inhibitor of this series.
