BACKGROUND
the marine red alga pyropia is one of the most economically important mariculture crops. it has an annual production of at least  <dig>  tons , which is estimated to be worth at least us$ <dig>  billion per year  <cit> . for hundreds of years, this crop has been cultivated in east asian countries such as china, korea, and japan, of which it is currently recognized as one of its largest aquaculture industries  <cit> . pyropia haitanensis chang et zheng, an endemic species naturally distributed and widely cultivated along the coasts of south china, has comprised 75 %–80 % of the total production of cultivated pyropia spp. in china  <cit> .

as sessile organisms that inhabit in the intertidal zones of rocky coasts, the thallus of py. haitanensis is totally submerged in water during high tide, but is exposed to the air during low tide. therefore, this crop is constantly exposed to fluctuating and extreme abiotic conditions such as cyclic changes in light levels, abrupt temperature changes, and repeated desiccation/rehydration due to the turning tides. consequently, py. haitanensis experiences far more rapid and severe water loss during low tide, and unavoidably suffers from dramatic changes of osmotic potential, which were largely different from the environmental stresses experienced by desiccation-tolerant land plants. py. haitanensis can tolerate extreme water loss  and dramatic changes in osmotic potential, consistent with other pyropia/porphyra species . therefore, py. haitanensis is considered an ideal model systerm for investigating the mechanisms of osmotic acclimation in intertidal seaweed.

several studies have elucidated that anatomical properties, as well as physiological and biochemical changes allow pyropia and porphyra species to tolerate osmotic stress, which in turn allow them to thrive in the intertidal zone. for example, blade cells secrete a cell wall that is an agar-like sulfated galactan disaccharide  with xylan microfibrils and proteoglycan elements  <cit> ; this hydrophilic wall could reduce the rate of water and mineral loss from pyropia and porphyra species during emersion. metabolic analyses showed that an increase in o-α-d-galactopyr-anosyl--glycerol  occurs under high salinity stress, suggesting that it acts as a compatible solute in reducing cytoplasmic and membrane damage  <cit> . abe et al.  <cit>  reported that pyropia dentata, a species that thrives at the highest intertidal level, can fully recover its photosynthetic activity after desiccation at a water potential of -158 mpa. several protective proteins are secreted and accumulate during osmotic stress, which have been shown to play a role in cellular protection during stress. for example, contreras-porcia et al.  <cit>  observed that in porphyra columbina, the activity of a diverse range of antioxidant enzymes increased during desiccation, whereas this activity diminished to near basal levels during rehydration. these intracellular proteins provide protection against osmotic stress by stabilizing membranes and organelles, as well as counteracting oxidative stress. furthermore, high levels of a dehydrin-like protein with a molecular weight of 17 kda, which is extremely hydrophilic under dehydrative conditions and thermally stable, was detected in porphyra umbilicalis, but not pyropia yezoensis, which suggests that this protein plays a key role in the observed superior desiccation tolerance in the former species  <cit> . in addition, expression of cyclophilin  was shown to be dysregulated in the blades of py. haitanensis under high salt stress, strong irradiance stress, and multifactorial stress compared to blades under normal conditions, thus suggesting that cyclophilin actively responded to stress situations and induced high stress tolerance  <cit> .

in the advent of next-generation sequencing , whole genome-wide expression profiling have become a rapid and efficient method for identifying genes and specific metabolic processes involved in stress response, especially in organisms whose genomes have not been fully sequenced. small-scale cdna sequencing projects, cdna microarrays, and de novo transcriptome sequencing have been performed in several stress-tolerant intertidal algae, including some pyropia species . moreover, plastid and mitochondrial genomes of several pyropia species have recently been sequenced . in addition, the draft genome sequence of py. yezoensis has been determined using ngs  <cit> , whereas whole genome sequencing projects of other pyropia species  have not been completed. although the pyropia species may be a source of genetic determinants for osmotic acclimation, defense response-related gene discovery efforts in marine algae have been limited, and the molecular mechanisms involved in osmotic acclimation remain unknown to date.

to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying osmotic acclimation and adaptation to intertidal environments, a comprehensive analysis of genome-wide gene expression profiles in response to dehydration and rehydration in py. haitanensis was performed. because the genome sequence of py. haitanensis is not yet available, deep expression profiling is feasible by large-scale sequencing of transcripts from eight hydrated and dehydrated py. haitanensis algae samples using illumina hiseq  <dig> platform. this sequencing dataset and analysis results will serve as a valuable resource for identifying the key genes and pathways involved in the response to osmotic stress in py. haitanensis. the findings of the present study will lay the foundation for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of osmotic acclimation and provide useful information for the genetic breeding of py. haitanensis.

RESULTS
global transcriptome assembly
due to the limited genome information on py. haitanensis, to obtain a global transcriptome of py. haitanensis, a cdna library was constructed from an equal mixture of rna isolated from different developmental phases and treatments . the library was sequenced using the illumina hiseq  <dig> platform. a total of  <dig>  million raw reads from the sequencing library were obtained. after quality filtering, a total of  <dig>  million  clean reads were obtained, corresponding to  <dig>  g bases. the gc content of the transcriptome was  <dig>  %. an overview of the sequencing is presented in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

using the trinity de novo assembly program  <cit> , all clean reads were assembled into  <dig>  transcripts, with an n <dig> length of 956 bp and an average length of 657 bp . the transcripts were subjected to cluster analysis. from these transcripts, a total of  <dig>  unigenes were obtained, with an n <dig> length of 827 bp and an average length of 607 bp . the length statistics of assembled transcripts and unigenes revealed that  <dig>  unigenes  were > 500 bp, and  <dig>  unigenes  were > 1 kb . these results demonstrated the effectiveness of illumina sequencing in rapidly capturing a large portion of the transcriptome. as expected, for a randomly fragmented transcriptome, there was a positive relationship between the length of a given unigene and the number of reads assembled into it .

function annotation of transcriptome unigenes
to assign accurate annotation information to all unigenes, multiple databases were interrogated, including ncbi non-redundant protein  database, ncbi non-redundant nucleotide sequence  database, the manually annotated and curated protein sequence  database, protein family , eukaryotic ortholog groups , gene ontology , and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  database. the overall functional annotation is presented in table  <dig>  a total of  <dig>  unigenes  were annotated in at least one database. among these,  <dig>   had significant matches in the nr database, whereas  <dig>   unigenes showed similarity to proteins in the swiss-prot database. in addition,  <dig>   and  <dig>   unigenes were successfully annotated in the go and kegg databases, respectively.table  <dig> statistics of functional annotation of the py. haitanensis transcriptome



sequencing and annotation for dge libraries
to characterize the digital gene expression profiles  involved in py. haitanensis response to dehydration/rehydration, a total of eight rna samples generated from two biological replicates under the four treatments  were subjected to dge sequencing analysis by using a illumina hiseq  <dig> sequencing platform, respectively . in total,  <dig>  million raw reads were generated from the eight samples. the number of raw reads per sample ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  million, with an average of  <dig>  million reads per sample. about 95 % of the raw reads passed the quality filters, resulting in a total of  <dig>  million clean reads. the number of clean reads in each sample ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  million.table  <dig> summary of sequencing results for eight dge libraries



clean reads from the eight samples were mapped to the global transcriptome of py. haitanensis and obtained from the annotation information of each sample using rsem software  <cit> . the number of mapped clean reads in each sample ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  million, accounting for  <dig>  %– <dig>  % of the total clean reads . in addition, the number of read-mapped unigenes ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . to evaluate the reproducibility of dge library sequencing, pearson correlation analysis was performed on every two replicates. a series of scatterplots comparing the normalized read counts  for the replicate libraries in each treatment are shown in additional file 4: figure s <dig>  the results showed that the square of the pearson correlation coefficient  between two replicate libraries in each treatment was >  <dig> , indicating the reliability as well as operational stability of the experimental results.

analysis of differentially expressed genes
read count data was used to identify the differentially expressed genes  among various treatments by using deseq packages  <cit> . a total of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> differentially expressed genes were identified  between mwl and con, swl and con, and reh and con, respectively.

a hierarchical cluster analysis of normalized expression values for the  <dig>  degs from pairwise comparisons among the four treatments  was performed . the analysis showed that the gene expression pattern in the mwl treatment was similar to that of the swl treatment, whereas it was markedly distinct from the reh treatment. furthermore, the  <dig>  unigenes were divided into  <dig> subclusters based on their expression modulation, representing  <dig> different expression patterns . in subcluster  <dig>  the unigenes were significantly enriched in the pathway of aminoacyl-trna biosynthesis, dna replication, mismatch repair, porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism, and nucleotide excision repair. in subclusters  <dig> and  <dig>  no significant enrichment was detected. subcluster  <dig> was significantly enriched with the pathway of pyrimidine metabolism, folate biosynthesis, and rna polymerase. in subcluster  <dig>  the unigenes were significantly enriched in the pathway of carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms, microbial metabolism in diverse environments, pentose phosphate pathway, fructose and mannose metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and biosynthesis of ansamycins. in subcluster  <dig>  the unigenes were significantly enriched in the pathway of dna replication, mismatch repair, base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, cell cycle, and non-homologous end-joining. in subcluster  <dig>  protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum was significantly enriched. in subclusters  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  no significant enrichment was detected.fig.  <dig> expression profile clustering of  <dig>  degs of pairwise comparison among four different treatments. colors indicate expression values scaled to standard deviations and centered at the normal intensity level . purple indicates increased expression and red decreased, relative to the normal conditions. the  <dig> different colored bars indicate unigenes in  <dig> subclusters in our data

a total of  <dig>  unigenes were significantly  differentially expressed between con and mwl. among these,  <dig> genes were significantly upregulated, whereas  <dig> genes were significantly downregulated . and  <dig>  degs were found between con and swl, which included  <dig>  upregulated unigenes and  <dig> downregulated unigenes . with regard to degs between con and mwl, go enrichment tests showed that there were  <dig> and  <dig> significantly enriched go terms in up- and downregulated unigenes, respectively . similarly, between con and swl, there were  <dig> significantly enriched go terms in upregulated unigenes . interestingly, within the upregulated go term associated with cell death, three unigenes  functioned in the induction of apoptosis and regulation of apoptotic process under moderate dehydration stress . the enriched go terms that were downregulated in mwl were mainly involved in trna aminoacylation and reproductive structure development. however, in contrast to that observed in mwl vs. con, the downregulated unigenes in swl were significantly enriched in  <dig> go terms, which included dna metabolic process, regulation of mitotic cell cycle, dna-dependent dna replication, and dna repair .fig.  <dig> the changes in gene expression profile among the different treatments. unigenes upregulated  and downregulated  in mwl vs. con, swl vs. con, and reh vs. con were quantified



based on kegg enrichment analysis, the upregulated unigenes in mwl were highly enriched in  <dig> pathways, including carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms , pentose phosphate pathway , and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites  . two categories of upregulated unigenes involved in the pathway of carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms were found, which included c4-pathway and c3-pathway enzymes. among these upregulated unigenes were  <dig> unigenes encoding c4-pathway enzymes, which included alanine transaminase , pyruvate kinase, and aspartate aminotransferase , whereas  <dig> unigenes encoding c3-pathway enzymes were identified . furthermore, within the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites,  <dig> upregulated unigenes  were found to be involved in trehalose biosynthesis , which included starch phosphorylase and  <dig> -alpha-glucan branching enzyme. in addition, the downregulated unigenes were highly enriched in  <dig> pathways such as dna replication  and porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism  . with respect to degs between con and swl, they were highly enriched in  <dig> pathways , nearly in accordance with that observed in mwl vs. con. as noted in the heatmap of gene expression, swl showed an expression pattern that was similar to that observed in mwl.table  <dig> expression variation of unigenes involved in the carbon fixation pathway based on ko database annotation

degs in the initial rapid response to rehydration treatment
comparative analysis showed that there were  <dig>  differentially expressed genes  between reh and con, of which  <dig> unigenes were upregulated and  <dig> unigenes were downregulated . go enrichment testing showed that  <dig> go terms, mainly including carbohydrate metabolism , were significantly enriched among the upregulated genes, whereas no go terms were enriched among the downregulated unigenes .

based on kegg analysis, the upregulated unigenes were highly enriched in carbon fixation in photosynthesis , fructose and mannose metabolism , pentose phosphate pathway , and protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum . interestingly, within the carbon fixation pathway, only  <dig> unigenes putatively encoding c3-pathway enzymes were significantly upregulated in response to rehydration treatment, whereas none of genes encoding c4-pathway enzymes were detected . nevertheless, the downregulated unigenes were highly enriched in dna replication , mismatch repair , nucleotide excision repair , abc transporters , cell cycle , and base excision repair . herein, there were  <dig> downregulated unigenes that were putatively encoding abcb <dig>  abcb <dig>  abcg <dig>  and mitochondrial abc transporter atm within the abc transporters .

additionally,  <dig> and  <dig> specific unigenes were only differentially regulated between mwl and con, and swl and con, respectively. moreover, a total of  <dig> specific unigenes showed significantly altered expression during rehydration. most of these specific unigenes encoded a range of transporters such as aquaporins , na+/k+ atpase alpha-subunit 1b , zip zinc transporters , as well as abc transporters  . in addition,  <dig> unigenes encoding various ribosomal proteins were also detected, which were involved in ribosome biogenesis/translation, thus strongly suggesting a role for de novo translation during rehydration in py. haitanensis.

features of the gene encoding  <dig> -alpha-glucan branching enzyme
with respect to the unigene  encoding  <dig> -alpha-glucan branching enzyme, which was identified as phsbe, it had  <dig>  nucleotide residues in which was contained an  <dig>  bp open reading frame, which was predicted to code for  <dig> amino acids with a molecular weight of  <dig>  kda . further alignment analysis revealed the gene was interrupted by the 291 bp and 208 bp introns, indicating that three exons and two introns were contained in the gene . analysis of amino acid sequence showed that it matched with alpha-amylase_c domain, without signal peptide. multiple sequence alignments showed that phsbe was highly conserved with  <dig> -alpha-glucan branching enzyme  found in other species. it identified 70 % with chondrus crispus , 69 % with gracilaria gracilis , 67 % with cyanidioschyzon merolae strain 10d , 59 % with galdieria sulphuraria , 56 % with arabidopsis thaliana , 57 % with zea mays  and 56 % with oryza sativa  .

validation of rna-seq-based gene expression
to validate the expression profiles obtained by rna-seq, qrt-pcr was performed on six genes selected at random with high or low expression levels. expression comparisons were performed between mwl and con, swl and con, and reh and con by qrt-pcr. generally, the expression profiles of the genes assayed show upregulated expression in response to mwl and swl, and marginal increases in response to reh, nearly confirming the dge expression data . two genes encoding omega- <dig> fatty acid desaturase  and pyruvate kinase  however showed downregulated expression in response to reh, which showed marginal upregulated expression in response to reh in dge expression data. the relative expression of the gene encoding malate dehydrogenase  was inverse to the expected expression, with downregulated expression in response to mwl and swl.fig.  <dig> qrt-pcr analysis of  <dig> randomly selected unigenes. a gene expression data for dge analysis. the relative expression changes of the genes were calculated as the log <dig> vaule of mwl/con, swl/con and reh/con and shown on the y-axis. b the qrt-pcr analysis of gene expression data. expression ratios of these genes in mwl, swl and reh were compared to con, respectively. error bars represent the sd for three biological replicates



discussion
the mechanism of desiccation tolerance in py. haitanensis
carbon fixation is the most important biological process in all photosynthetic organisms, which can be divided into three general categories: c <dig>  c <dig>  and crassulacean acid metabolism   <cit> . the calvin cycle  is the most basic and universal form of net carbon fixation in plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. however, the c <dig> pathway is an adjunct of the c <dig> pathway that developed novel and efficient co <dig> concentration mechanisms to enhance ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase  performance even at limiting ambient co <dig> levels  <cit> . the c <dig> pathway has long been studied in higher plants with much higher photosynthetic rates than c <dig> plants  <cit> . nevertheless, the c <dig> pathway in algae has also been the subject of several reports in the past decade. the c <dig> pathway is important in carbon accumulation and photosynthetic carbon fixation in the marine diatom thalassiosira weissflogii at conditions of low  co <dig>  <cit> . by genome analysis, all the required genes involved in c <dig> photosynthesis were presented in unicellular green algae ostreococcus tauri, which is the smallest free-living eukaryote yet described  <cit> . with respect to the red algae, yang et al.  <cit>  reported that, except for pyruvate phosphate dikinase, almost all genes involved in the c <dig> pathway have been identified in py. yezoensis. meanwhile, c. crispus genome possesses two nadp-malic enzymes , three malate dehydrogenases , and one phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase , and thus a malate-based c4-like carbon fixation pathway was considered to be present in the algal species  <cit> . in py. haitanensis, the expression level of rubisco  was significantly lower in the conchocelis than that in the thallus, whereas the expression levels of pepc and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase , which are the key genes in the c <dig> pathway, were significantly higher in the conchocelis than that in the thallus  <cit> . the c4-like pathway was thus considered to play an important role in the fixation of inorganic carbon in the conchocelis stage of py. haitanensis  <cit> . interestingly, by dge analysis, a large number of unigenes encoding c <dig> and c <dig> pathway-related enzymes were significantly upregulated in response to both mwl and swl treatment, except for  <dig> unigenes . therefore, c <dig> pathway- and c <dig> pathway-related genes may collectively play an important role in the fixation of inorganic carbon when py. haitanensis gametophytes were subjected to desiccation stress.

in most cases, the ability of the plant to survive desiccation correlates with the accumulation of carbohydrates. trehalose -α-d-glucopyranoside) is a non-reducing disaccharide of two glucose units that is predominantly present in desiccation-tolerant lower organisms, including some vascular plants such as selaginella tamariscina, the moss, tortula ruralis, and algae , and functions as a stress protection metabolite in the stabilization of biological structures under various abiotic stresses  <cit> . in the present study, two upregulated unigenes encoding starch phosphorylase and  <dig> -alpha-glucan branching enzyme were detected in dehydration treatment, which were predicted to involved in trehalose biosynthesis . the two genes were also reported to be present in c. crispus genome, as well as g. gracilis, c. merolae, and g. sulphuraria genomes . in bacteria, fungi, plants and invertebrates, udp-glucose is a precursor for making trehalose. the production of udp-glucose from glucose 1-phosphate can be mediated by a classic utp-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase   <cit> . and the release of the glucose-1-p  from the non-reducing ends of the outer chains of polysaccharides composed of a- <dig> -linked glucose residues, such as amylopectin, is catalysed by starch phosphorylase. furthermore,  <dig> -alpha-glucan branching enzyme catalyses the biosynthesis of amylopectin from amylose. it is supposed that two upregulated unigenes may promote the release of the glucose-1-p  by degradation of amylopectin-like floridean starch, which further promote accumulation of trehalose, contributing to protecting the algae against osmotic stress in intertidal environment.

chlorophyll biosynthesis in plants is subjected to modulation by various environmental factors. for example, in etiolated rice seedlings, ionic imbalance due to salinity stress resulted in additional downregulation  of seedling dry weight, as well as chlorophyll and carotenoid levels  <cit> . meanwhile, in helianthus annuus l. plants, salt stress more drastically affects chlorophyll synthesis  than chlorophyllase-mediated degradation  <cit> . in the current study,  <dig> down-regulated unigenes encoding chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway enzymes in mwl, i.e. oxygen-dependent protoporphyrinogen oxidase and magnesium chelatase subunit h were detected, including one downregulated unigene that encoded for glutamate-1-semialdehyde  <dig> -aminomutase in swl. the downregulation of these enzymes resulted in a reduction in chlorophyll synthesis, which was similar to that observed in higher plants. previous reports have shown that photosynthetic co <dig> fixation in higher plants is inhibited by water-deficit stress, and the excitation energy by chlorophyll can greatly exceed the demand of the calvin cycle for atp and nadph, thus resulting in the overreduction of the electron transport chain and enhanced generation of ros, ultimately leading to inhibition of ps ii reaction centers, damage to the atp synthesizing machinery, and a decrease in photosynthetic rate . based on these findings, it is therefore assumed that in py. haitanensis, the downregulation of chlorophyll biosynthesis contributes to the inhibition of the accumulation of highly photosensitive photodynamic tetrapyrroles that generates ros under stress conditions. thus, the downregulation of chlorophyll biosynthesis is advantageous in py. haitanensis because the accumulation of toxic ros is reduced.

apoptosis is a basic biological process that functions in various aspects of animal and plant development and in their responses to stress  <cit> . cysteine proteases  are key components of animal apoptosis  <cit> , and the activation of cysteine proteases constitutes the critical point in the apoptosis pathway of animal cells  <cit> . however, while animals have caspase genes, plants such as arabidopsis and rice do not harbor orthologous caspase sequences in their genomes, whereas caspase-like activities have also been detected in plant cells  <cit> . instead, plant genomes encode several related proteins, called metacaspases, which were found to mediate apoptosis  <cit> . meanwhile, there is evidence for a mitochondrial release of apoptosis activating molecules following a moderate level 55 °c heat shock  <cit> . recently, in red algae c. crispus, several homologues of apoptosis- and programmed cell death-related genes were also identified in the genome, including metacaspases, apoptosis inducing factor, bax inhibitor, etc  <cit> . furthermore, in py. yezoensis, the expression of genes encoding metacaspases was found to be upregulated under high-temperature stress, revealing their important roles in py. yezoensis acclimation to heat stress  <cit> . similar to higher plants and other red algae, classical caspase genes or transcripts were not found in py. haitanensis. it is worth noting that one unigene  encoding metacaspase was also found to be up-regulated under desiccation stress, but none was found in rehydration. and three upregulated unigenes putatively encoding for the mitochondria-derived activator of caspases were detected under desiccation stress, functioning in the induction of apoptosis and the regulation of apoptotic process . it is therefore likely that in response to desiccation stress, the apoptogenic proteins such as mitochondria-derived activator of caspases, were released from the mitochondria, which led to the activation of metacaspase molecules, and thereby resulting in apoptosis. pyropia and other red algal species grown in harsh intertidal habitats posses an nearly overall apoptosis picture similar of the one found in plants.

the initial rapid response of py. haitanensis to rehydration
rehydration-induced revival of various metabolic processes in plants requires an efficient transport machinery. water transport is of great importance to water homeostasis in plants subjected to dehydration and rehydration. water channel proteins  often facilitate osmotic water flow across membranes, and are critical for osmotic regulation and glycerol transport in vascular plants, which in turn can mediate co <dig> permeability and photosynthetic activity  <cit> . the expression of several aquaporins is regulated in response to environmental factors such as dehydration stress, salinity stress, and rehydration . two recent studies clearly demonstrated the effective involvement of aquaporins in conferring stress tolerance in higher plants  <cit> . the aquaporins in algae have also been the subject of several reports in recent decades. henzler and steudle  <cit>  demonstrated that algal membranes can be modeled as composite structures in which water is transported through highly selective aquaporins, while solutes permeate via other routes through the membrane. akai et al.  <cit>  further reported that in the cyanobacterium synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig>  the aquaporin  was involved in cell volume regulation and functioned as a water transport system that responds to daily oscillations of intracellular osmolarity. the published genome of chlamydomonas contains three putative aquaporins: mip <dig> , mip <dig> , and mip <dig>   <cit> . moreover, mip <dig> was found to be localized to the contractile vacuole in chlamydomonas, functioning in vivo as a water channel  <cit> . in the red alga porphyra purpurea, some est contigs putatively encoding aquaporins have been detected, although information on the specific functions of these channel proteins is currently limited  <cit> . similarly, in this work, two aquaporin unigenes were found to have altered expression in response to rehydration, of which one aquaporin unigene was upregulated and the other was downregulated, whereas none was observed in differentially expressed genes between mwl and con, as well as swl and con. plants aquaporins exhibit a high diversity with many different isoforms. molecular analyses on regulation of the whole aquaporin family have often revealed complex transcriptional and post-translational response patterns, with sometimes opposite profiles between isoforms  <cit> . it seems possible that above two unigenes code for different isoforms, and the increase in expression levels of one aquaporin gene might provide py. haitanensis additional ability to increase the water permeability of the cells under rehydration. on the other hand, the py. haitanensis may avoid water loss by downregulating another aquaporin gene during rehydration. thus, in py. haitanensis, these various aquaporins were actively involved in modulating transmembrane water transport during the initial phases following rehydration when subjected to dehydration stress. although in evolutionary viewpoint, the genome architectures of red algae are distantly related with the vascular plants  <cit> , the aquaporins could represent the ancient water transport system throughout evolution of plants. further work is clearly required to completely understand the roles and involvement of the aquaporins in the intertidal algae response to rehydration.

additionally, solute  transport in and out of the vacuoles of desiccation-tolerant angiosperms occurs during desiccation and rehydration  <cit> . in addition, there is a significant representation within the transporter subcategory in the rehydration transcriptome of the desiccation-tolerant bryophyte t. ruralis  <cit> . similarly, several transport-associated unigenes were exclusively detected in response to rehydration in the present study, which encode abc transporters, ion transporters, phosphate transporters, and aquaporins, thus suggesting that these may constitute the transport machinery of py. haitanensis under rehydration conditions. in particular, the unigenes encoding abc transporters were downregulated during rehydration . abc transporters have been recognized to participate in a multitude of physiological processes that allow the plant to adapt to changing environments and cope with biotic and abiotic stresses, as well as detoxification processes  <cit> . chan et al. has also identified several abc transporters that were related to multidrug resistance, bile salt pumps, and the transport of lipids into the plastid in p. purpurea and p. umbilicalis transcriptome  <cit> . therefore, it is likely that during rehydration, the downregulation of unigenes encoding abc transporters instantly matched the decrease in the requirement for lipids and lipophilic compounds that protect the plant from biotic and abiotic stresses, with the revival of many biological metabolism.

facultative c3-cam species such as guzmania monostachia  and talinum triangulare  can be induced by various environmental factors such as drought stress and salinity to utilize, and then returned to a typical c <dig> condition after a subsequent period of seven days of rehydration  <cit> . unlike that observed during dehydration treatment, many of the unigenes associated with the c <dig> pathway for photosynthetic carbon reduction were also not significantly altered, whereas many unigenes in py. haitanensis that were involved in a putative c <dig> pathway for photosynthetic carbon assimilation were upregulated under rehydration, suggesting the return of a typical c <dig> condition after a subsequent period of one half hour of rehydration. these results revealed that py. haitanensis employed different carbon-concentrating mechanisms based on the actual environmental factor.

genes collectively responding to dehydration and rehydration in py. haitanensis
unsaturated fatty acids  have profound effects on the fluidity and function of biological membranes. plants, animals, and microorganisms regulate the synthesis of ufas to remodel membrane fluidity during changing environmental conditions as well as in response to nutrients  <cit> . various fatty acid desaturases  are key enzymes in the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. in higher plants, drought tolerance is considered to be closely correlated with the level of unsaturated fatty acids . for example, the increase in α-linolenic acid  levels in nicotiana tabacum cells due to the overexpression of the ω- <dig> fatty acid desaturases fad <dig> and fad <dig> enhances tolerance to drought stress  <cit> , whereas non-tolerant plants decline their fraction of 18: <dig>  <cit> . in addition, several studies have been performed to explore the role of unsaturated fatty acids in red algae. sun et al.  <cit>  reported that in py. yezoensis cold stress caused an increase in the expression of fad to improve the proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids. furthermore, the amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially those of 20: <dig> and 20: <dig>  were decreased significantly in conchocelis of py. haitanensis with the increase in temperature whereas thallus exhibited only minor differences in fatty acid levels between control and the heat stress treatments with a slight decrease of 20: <dig> and an increase of 20: <dig>  <cit> . in the present study, different from that in response to temperature stress, all of differentially expressed unigenes encoding fatty acid desaturases and fatty acid elongase were collectively upregulated in response to dehydration and rehydration . thus, in py. haitanensis, fatty acid desaturases and fatty acid elongase were involved in the increase in blade membrane unsaturation in response to dehydration and rehydration, all of which contributes to their osmotic acclimation to the intertidal habitat.

families of transcription factors functioned downstream of signaling cascades that were related to biological and environmental stimuli. several members of these families were previously identified to be responsive to various stresses  <cit>  such as bzip to drought and abscisic acid , myb to dehydration, zinc finger to cold and drought, bhlh and nac to drought, salinity, and aba. recently, transcription factors such as bzip and zinc-finger protein were present both in stressed and rehydrated samples of poplar   <cit> . similarly, of the  <dig> differentially expressed unigenes encoding transcription factors in mwl, swl, and reh as compared to con,  <dig> unigenes, which included bzip and zinc-finger protein, were collectively upregulated or downregulated in dehydration/desiccation-stressed and rehydrated samples of py. haitanensis . in higher plants, transcription factors belonging to the class of dre-binding protein /c-repeat-binding factor , bzip, myc, and myb homologs are involved in aba-dependent or aba-independent stress signaling pathways . interestingly, in the present study, one unigene encoding 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase , which is an important enzyme in the synthesis of the phytohormone aba  <cit> , was found to be upregulated in response to moderate dehydration, severe dehydration, and rehydration, thus revealing endogenous aba levels may be induced as a result of dehydration and rehydration. several of the drought-related genes can be induced by aba. for example, the arabidopsis rd <dig> bp <dig> gene that encodes a myc homologue transcription factor has been shown to be induced by dehydration, high-salt conditions, and aba  <cit> . in py. haitanensis, the upregulation of several unigenes encoding bzips by endogenous aba in response to dehydration and rehydration still needs further verification. in addition, research studies that examine the roles and involvement of these transcription factors in stress signaling pathways of py. haitanensis are also warranted.

CONCLUSIONS
the combination of de novo transcriptome sequencing and dge analysis based on the ngs technology is a powerful method for identifying candidate genes and key metabolic processes involved in the response to osmotic stress in pyripoa species. using this method, genes associated with the c <dig> and c <dig> pathways, trehalose biosynthesis, porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism, induction of apoptosis, reproductive structure development, and other carbohydrate metabolic process were determined to be involved in the desiccation response. on the other hand, we demonstrated the mechanisms involved in the initial response to rehydration based on the following perspectives: multiple transport machinery such as aquaporins and abc transporters, and the return of the normal c <dig> condition. in addition, the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, various transcription factor families, and molecular chaperones have collectively been implicated in the process of dehydration and rehydration in py. haitanensis. the transcriptome data generated in the present study can serve as an important resource for understanding tolerance mechanisms of py. haitanensis as it thrives in its unique intertidal environment.
