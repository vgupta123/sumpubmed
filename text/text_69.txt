BACKGROUND
human infection with avian influenza a  was first reported in china in march  <dig>  and since then hundreds of human cases have been confirmed. the disease is associated severe respiratory illness, and the high mortality rate has garnered increasing attention globally  <cit> . the ability of the virus to transmit from avian species to humans has contributed to its spread to neighbouring areas of china and raises serious concerns over its pandemic potential, particularly in areas with poultry farming industry. with the growing need for countermeasures against the infectious threat, development of effective vaccines is of increasing importance. in addition to ongoing efforts on developing human vaccines against avian influenza virus a/h7n <dig>  formulations that can effectively mount immunity in avian models are of significant public health and economic considerations as they may contain interspecies transmissions and improve overall poultry health. with the aim to prepare a vaccine candidate towards both human and avian applications, we prepared and characterized an a/h7n9-mimicking virus-like particle . the immune-potentiating effect of the vlp was evaluated in both a mammalian  and an avian  model to examine the particles’ potential as an anti-viral vaccine.

similar to other influenza a viruses, h7n <dig> viral capsids are comprised of three primary proteins, including hemagglutinin , neuraminidase , and matrix protein  <dig> . upon co-expression, these three proteins self-assemble into nanoparticles, which are responsible for packaging viral genomes for disease transmission  <cit> . previously, vlps, which are non-infectious particles devoid of any viral genes, have been shown to induce protective immunity against influenza and other viral diseases . the vlps’ morphological and antigenic semblance to native virions facilitate effective immune processing, making them a compelling alternative to free viral antigens as vaccine candidates. in the present study, vlps consisting of hemagglutinin , neuraminidase  and matrix protein  <dig>  derived from the human isolate a/taiwan/s02076/ <dig>  were prepared for vaccine development. a combinatorial baculoviral system was applied to generate vlps co-expressing the three viral proteins, which have been recognized as major antigenic targets of the h7n <dig> virus  <cit> . the resulting vlps were assayed for their hemagglutination activity. nanoparticle tracking analysis was applied to verify the size, surface charge, and concentration of the vlps, and transmission electron microscopy following immunogold staining was performed to validate the vlps’ multi-antigenic nature. a mouse model was first used to validate the vlps’ immunogenicity, and a particular emphasis was placed on the humoral and cellular immune responses in a chicken model following vaccination with either vlps or free protein antigens. results observed from the study offer hope that the formulation may find applications in both clinical and agricultural settings.

s. frugiperda sf <dig>  and sf <dig>  insect cells were maintained as suspension cultures in grace’s medium  and supplemented with 10% fbs  and 1% p/s/a antibiotics .

recombinant baculoviruses were prepared by using the bac-to-bac baculovirus expression system . briefly, three separate recombinant plasmids were constructed by inserting full ha, na, and m <dig> genes of a/taiwan/s02076/ <dig>  into the pfastbac- <dig> vector using primers listed in table  <dig>  the recombinant pfastbac- <dig> shuttle vectors were then transposed to the bacmid in e. coli strain dh10bac, and recombinant bacmid was purified using the hipure plasmid midiprep kit . sf <dig> cells were used for transfection with the recombinant bacmid. right before transfection, 8 μl of the cellfectin ii reagent  was diluted in 100 μl of grace’s medium , and 1 μg of bacmid dna was diluted in 100 μl of grace’s medium . subsequently, the diluted bacmid dna and diluted cellfectin ii were combined and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. the dna-lipid mixture was then added onto the cells dropwise and incubated at 27 °c for 4 h. following removal of transfection mixture, fresh cell medium was added to the cells. after 72 h, recombinant baculoviruses were harvested from the supernatant and designated as rbac-h <dig>  rbac-n <dig>  and rbac-m <dig>  respectively. the recombinant baculoviruses were subsequently amplified in sf <dig> cells, and virus titers were determined by plaque assays in sf <dig> cells.table  <dig> primer sets used in the plasmid construction

RESULTS
production of h7n <dig> vlps
the full length ha , na , and m <dig>  genes of a/taiwan/s02076/ <dig> were cloned into three separate recombinant baculoviruses. as indicated in fig.  <dig>  sf <dig> cells were co-infected by the three recombinant baculoviruses, rbac-h <dig>  rbac-n <dig>  rbac-m <dig>  to generate h7n <dig> vlps. the titer of each recombinant baculovirus was determined as 6 ×  <dig> plaque-forming unit /ml, 3 ×  <dig> pfu/ml, and 1 ×  <dig> pfu/ml, respectively, by plaque assays . the expression of ha, na, and m <dig> proteins in sf <dig> cells was identified by ifa using fitc-labelled antigen-specific antibodies. in sf <dig> cells nuclei-stained with dapi, fitc signal was observed in the cytoplasm , indicating successful protein expression by the respective recombinant baculovirus. in contrast, no fitc signal was observed from the uninfected sf <dig> cells following staining by any of the antigen-specific antibodies .fig.  <dig> a schematic diagram of h7n <dig> vlp expression. the genes ha, na, and m <dig> were cloned into three recombinant baculoviruses, respectively. sf <dig> cells were co-infected by the three recombinant baculoviruses, and the vlps that assembled ha, na, and m <dig> were harvested in the sf <dig> culture supernatant


fig.  <dig> expression and characterization of h7n <dig> vlp. a the viral titers of three recombinant baculoviruses were determined by plaque assay. the titer of recombinant baculovirus-ha  was approxmiately 6 ×  <dig> pfu/ml , the rbac-na 3 ×  <dig> pfu/ml , and the rbac-m <dig>  <dig>  ×  <dig> pfu/ml . the protein expression of ha, na, and m <dig> was identified respectively by immunofluorescence assay . b sf <dig> cells were co-infected with rbac-ha, rbac-na, and rbac-m <dig> under various moi combinations, and the vlps were purified via sucrose gradient centrifugation. formulation derived from the combinations of rbac-ha , rbac-na , and rbac-m <dig>  co-infection exhibited the highest ha activity. c h7n <dig> vlp, h7/ha protein, n9/na protein, and m <dig> proteins were detected by western blot




as ha is a primary protein that determines the antigenic signature and virulence of influenza viruses, we applied an ha activity assay using chicken red blood cells to optimize the co-infection condition and the vlp collection protocol. the three recombinant baculoviruses of different combinations of multiplicity of infection were prepared to co-infect sf <dig> cells. the culture supernatants of the resulting co-infected sf <dig> cells were subsequently collected and purified using sucrose gradient centrifugation. among four different combinations of moi, the highest ha titer  was obtained from the co-infection condition at an moi of  <dig> for each of the recombinant baculovirus. this heightened ha activity was particularly pronounced in fractions containing 30–40 wt.% of sucrose . based on the observation, all vlps in the remainder of the study were prepared using sf <dig> cells co-infected with the three recombinant baculoviruses with an moi of  <dig>  plaque assays were applied to ensure undetectable titer of residual baculovirus for every batch of the vlps.

characterization of h7n <dig> vlps
upon collection of purified vlps, western blotting analysis was applied to confirm the presence of all three of the ha , na , and m <dig>  proteins. each protein on the vlps was observed to be largely identical in size to the protein from cells infected individually by rbac-h <dig>  rbac-n <dig>  and rbac-m <dig> . this result indicates the three proteins self-assemble without undergoing further modifications.

to examine the formation and antigen display of the h7n <dig> vlps, immunogold staining was performed. under the tem visualization, particles approximately 120 nm in diameter were observed, confirming successful preparation of vlps that resemble the morphology of h7n <dig> viruses. labeling by immunogold further confirmed the presence of ha proteins  and na proteins  on the surface of the particles. examination by nanoparticle tracking analysis revealed a unimodal particle size distribution for the vlps with an average particle diameter of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm, which is similar to that of a native h1n <dig> virus  observed using the technique . the surface charge of the vlps is −24 ±  <dig>  mv, which is also similar to that measured from the h1n <dig> virus  . in addition, the nanoparticle tracking analysis provided insight to the mass of each individual vlp. based on the observed particle concentration and protein quantification by bradford assay, it was approximated that there are  <dig>  ×  <dig> particles per 1 μg of the vlps, yielding a molecular weight of roughly  <dig>  × 108 da per particle. protein quantification showed that the ha protein contributed to approximately 10% of total proteins in collected h7n <dig> vlps , translating to ~ <dig> ha proteins per vlp. the number of ha proteins per vlp is in line with the estimated number in native virion  <cit> . the purified h7n <dig> vlps agglutinate rbcs at a minimum total protein amount of  <dig>  μg , indicating proper display of the receptor-binding domain of ha protein in the vlps.fig.  <dig> the formation of vlp and proper antigen display of viral proteins were verified. a the ha  and na  proteins were detected by antibodies labeled with 6 nm gold under a transmission electron microscope. scale bars = 50 nm. b size distribution and  surface zeta potential of the vlps were analyzed using nanoparticle tracking analysis. influenza virus a/puertorico/8/ <dig> was analyzed under the same settings as a reference. d hemagglutination activity of h7n <dig> vlps was assessed by a hemagglutination assay. the total protein contents of h7n <dig> vlp are indicated based on a two-fold serial dilution. pbs was included as the negative control




h7n <dig> vlp immunization elicited hemagglutination-inhibition antibody response in mice
to validate the vlps’ immunogenicity, mice were immunized twice with 10 μg of the vlp  with a two-week interval . blood was collected right before each vaccination for analysis. the level of serum hi antibody was evaluated by an hi test. as compared to the pbs-immunization control group, vlp-immunized mice exhibited a higher hi antibody response after a primary and a booster vaccination. on day  <dig>  the average hi antibody endpoint dilution titer reached 1: <dig> and 1: <dig> against  <dig> hemagglutination units of h7n <dig> vlps and inactivated h7n <dig> virions respectively . the study validates the h7n <dig> vlp’s ability to elicit an anti-ha humoral response in mice.fig.  <dig> the immunogenicity of h7n <dig> vlp in a mouse model. a mice  were immunized with vlps  or pbs, and blood samples were collected. mice receiving h7n <dig> vlps showed significantly increased serum hi titer against the h7n <dig> inactivated virions  or h7n <dig> vlps . mice splenocytes were isolated on day  <dig> and restimulated ex vivo with the h7n <dig> vlps. the antigen-specific cytokine responses were detected by intracellular cytokine staining. comparing with the pbs control, mice receiving the h7n <dig> vlps showed elevated cd <dig> il- <dig> and cd <dig> tnf production , whereas the production of cd <dig> ifn-γ or cd <dig> ifn-γ revealed no statistical difference . error bars are mean ± sem. *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> , and ***p <  <dig> 




h7n <dig> vlp immunization promotes virus-specific t cell immunity in mice
to examine splenic virus-specific t cell response in h7n <dig> vlp-immunized mice, intracellular cytokine staining was conducted on the harvested splenocytes on the day of sacrifice. in vlp-vaccinated mice, production of il- <dig> and tnf were shown to be elevated in splenic cd <dig> and cd <dig> t cells respectively . although statistical significance was not reached, the mean percentage of ifn-γ-producing cd <dig> and cd <dig> t cells in mice spleens was observed to be greater than the control group following vlp vaccination . the results suggest that the vlp is capable to raising viral antigen-specific t cell immunity in mammals.

h7n <dig> vlp immunization induced hi, anti-na, and anti-m <dig> humoral responses in chickens
to examine the immune-potentiating effect of the h7n <dig> vlps in avian species, two-week-old spf chickens were administered with a primary and a booster vaccination of 10 μg of vlps on day  <dig> and day  <dig> . to further evaluate the vlps’ effectiveness, an additional group of chickens were inoculated with 10 μg of free antigens consisting of ha, na, and m <dig> at an 1:1: <dig> molar ratio for comparison. a group administered with pbs was prepared in parallel as control. blood was collected on day  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> to assess the serum hi titers. in experiments using inactivated h7n <dig> virions as ha antigens, changes in hi serum titers could be observed after day  <dig> . even though chickens receiving free proteins also showed increased hi titers as compared to the pbs control, the vlp-vaccinated group had significantly higher hi titers. a low hi activity was observed for the pbs control. over the observation period, hi titers for both vlp and free protein groups increased over time, reaching a peak at  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively.fig.  <dig> the immunogenicity of h7n <dig> vlp in a chicken model. a spf chickens  were immunized with vlps, ha/na/m <dig> free proteins  or pbs, and blood samples were collected. b chickens receiving h7n <dig> vlps showed significantly increased serum hi titer against the h7n <dig> inactivated virions. error bars are mean ± sem. c, d on day  <dig> post-immunization, chickens receiving vlps exhibited higher serum elisa titers against purified na and m <dig> proteins as compared to the pbs control. lines and boxes represent upper extreme, 25th, 50th, 75th percentile, and lower extreme. *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> , and ***p <  <dig> 




anti-na and anti-m <dig> titers in the serum of the vaccinated chickens were also quantified by elisa with the blood samples collected on day  <dig> post immunization. for the anti-na titer, immunization with free protein was found to elevate the titer to a median value of  <dig> , whereas immunization with the vlp resulted in a median titer of  <dig>  . similarly, vlp immunization elicited higher anti-m <dig> titer  as compared to free protein immunization  . the experimental results confirm the presence of ha, na, and m <dig> on the vlps. the vlps’ are also demonstrated to possess superior capability in eliciting antigen-specific humoral responses as compared to free protein antigens.

h7n <dig> vlp elicited virus-specific t cell response in chickens
to analyze antigen-specific t cell responses in chickens, chicken spleens were harvested on day  <dig> post immunization. following splenocyte isolation and stimulation with h7n <dig> vlps, the splenocytes were lysed and real-time rt-pcr was performed to quantify ifn-γ and il- <dig> mrna expression levels . it was observed that immunization with free protein formulation and vlps increased the ifn-γ and il- <dig> levels, indicating elicitation of both th1- and th2-directed immune responses by both formulations. upon statistical analysis, however, only the vlps induced significantly higher ifn-γ and il- <dig> expression, whereas enhancement by the free protein formulation did not achieve statistical significance owing to a high degree of variability. the results indicate that the immune responses induced by the free proteins can be highly variable. in contrast, immunization with the vlps facilitated a more consistent and robust induction in both th <dig> and th <dig> responses.fig.  <dig> cell-mediated immunity response induced by h7n <dig> vlp in chickens . splenocytes isolated from chickens on day  <dig> after immunization were stimulated ex vivo with h7n <dig> vlps, and the cell-mediated response was evaluated. a splenic ifn-γ and  il- <dig> mrna levels were investigated using real-time pcr. by using flow cytometry, chickens receiving vlps exhibit significantly higher ratio of splenic cd4+ / cd8+ cell count , indicating stronger t helper cell response induced by h7n <dig> vlp vaccination. error bars are mean ± sem. *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> , and ***p <  <dig> 




cd4/cd <dig> ratio was also analyzed using flow cytometric analysis . on day  <dig> post immunization, vlp immunization was shown to significantly increase the cd4/cd <dig> ratio from a mean value of  <dig>  to  <dig>  . while the immunization with the free protein formulation also increased the mean value of cd4/cd <dig> ratio, no statistical significant was observed . the results corroborate a more robust and consistent immune response upon exposure to h7n <dig> virions following vlp immunization.

discussion
since the identification of the avian influenza a  infection in human in march  <dig>  the viral threat has prompted a global effort to develop vaccine candidates as humans have little immunity to this reassorted virus . this leap of the virus from birds to humans was attributed to multiple reassortment events, and continuing reassortment events may lead to emergence of more infective strains. disease management at both the human and animal levels are thus of major importance. in this study, a/taiwan/s02076/ <dig>  a strain isolated in taiwan  <cit> , was used for the development of a vaccine candidate through the preparation of vlps. co-infection of recombinant baculoviruses in insect cells yielded influenza a/h7n <dig> vlps that coexpressed ha, na, and m <dig> proteins, which have molecular weights consistent with previously published studies  <cit> . the vlps are monodisperse and contain approximately  <dig> ha proteins per particles. these vlps were found to induce proper humoral and cellular immunity against the h7n <dig> virus in animal models. in particular, the vlps were found to be superior in eliciting viral-antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses as compared to a free protein formulation in an avian model, which has not been investigated previously.

vlps are a versatile system that presents a compelling alternative to conventional vaccine formulations as they possess the morphological semblance to natural viral particles. in the present study we applied nanoparticle tracking analysis and transmission electron microscopy to validate the structure and antigenicity of the vlps. these analyses showed virus-like features consistent with other vlp formulations reported in previous studies  <cit> . it is worth noting that although an sf <dig> insect cell system was adopted for the production of the h7n <dig> vlps in this study, the vlp platform is highly versatile and may be produced using other culture systems. for instance, a previous study by chang et al. employed an alternate high five insect cell culture system for vlp production  <cit> , demonstrating high production yield upon high five system optimization. in the present study, we showed that varying the moi of the different recombinant baculoviruses impacted the vlp production, offering information toward further optimization of the sf <dig> system for vlp generation.

we first validated the potency of the vlps in a mouse model. given that neutralizing antibodies against the globular head of hemagglutinin protein are the primary mediators of most vaccine-induced protection against influenza, a hemagglutination inhibition assay was used to examine the vlps as a vaccine candidate against h7n <dig>  an hi antibody titer of 1: <dig> is the accepted correlate of protection for human ha split inactivated vaccines  <cit> . immunization with the vlps resulted in a mouse serum hi titer of 1: <dig> against the h7n <dig> virions. although future animal studies with viral challenges are warranted, the present result validates the immunopotentiation effect of our vlps, which is on par with those in previous reports.

despite previous studies that examined different formulations of h7n <dig> vlps in mouse models , no examination of h7n <dig> vaccination in avian models has been reported to the best of our knowledge. given that the management of the avian influenza virus would benefit from both human and poultry vaccinations, we investigated the vlps’ vaccination effect in spf chickens. as compared to a free protein formulation, the vlp vaccination yielded increased hi serum titers, anti-na titers, and anti-m <dig> titers. it is also worth noting that upon examination of cellular immune responses, we observed that the vlp immunization resulted in elevated splenic ifn-γ and il- <dig> upon subsequent viral exposure. the cellular immune responses elicited by vlps in spf chickens are consistent with previous studies examining vlp immunizations in other animal models  <cit> .

in the present study, we purified our vlps and made sure that no detectable baculovirus titer was present in any of our batches. the purification is critical as residual baculoviral proteins were previously shown to trigger innate immune responses through tlr <dig> and other pattern recognition receptors  <cit> . towards future clinical translation, the elimination of residual baculovirus contamination is of high importance.

even though the free protein formulation, which is a mixture consisting of free ha, na, and m <dig> proteins at a 1:1: <dig> ratio, also elicited humoral and cellular responses in our study, the responses were either weaker or more variable as compared to those elicited by the vlps. the finding fortifies the notion that the h7n <dig> vlps may serve as a compelling vaccine candidate in poultry farming, which typically employs inactivated or subunit vaccines for disease management .

CONCLUSIONS
our study has prepared h7n <dig> vlps co-expressing ha, na, and m <dig> as a vaccine candidate against avian influenza. the platform elicited more potent humoral immune responses and more consistent cellular immune responses as compared to the free protein formulation. although future studies involving viral challenges are warranted, the platform presents a viable candidate for avian influenza management in both human and animal settings.
