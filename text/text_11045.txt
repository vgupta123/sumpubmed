BACKGROUND
model systems play an important role in studies of genome structure and evolution, and are invaluable in gene isolation and functional characterization. the application of model systems toward the study of both basic and applied problems in plant biology has become routine. the model dicot arabidopsis thaliana has been used in studies ranging from nutrient uptake and metabolism to plant-pathogen interactions. unfortunately, due to its distant relationship to monocots, arabidopsis is not an ideal model for grasses. rice is being currently used as a grass model  <cit> , but its primary adaptation to semi-aquatic, subtropical environments limits its usefulness. the large sizes of rice plants and long generation time make experiments requiring large numbers of plants grown under controlled conditions costly. it is also challenging to grow rice under the conditions prevailing in greenhouses in northern climates.

brachypodium distachyon has numerous attributes expected to find in a genetic model and interest in using it as a model system for wheat and other temperate grasses is growing rapidly  <cit> . diploid b. distachyon is closely related to the triticeae  <cit>  but in contrast to the triticeae, it possesses a very small genome  of approximately  <dig> mb  <cit> . the recent release of 8× b. distachyon genome sequence showed that the genome is  <dig> mb in size . it is a small temperate grass with simple growth requirements, short generation time, and self-pollinating habit  <cit> . highly efficient transformation of b. distachyon via agrobacterium tumefaciens has been developed, which will facilitate its functional genomics and biotechnological applications  <cit> . these characteristics make b. distachyon superbly suitable for both functional and comparative genomic research.

several genomic regions of b. distachyon and b. sylvaticum, a close relative of b. distachyon with a larger genome, have been compared with wheat and rice. in general, good colinearity was observed reflecting general conservation of synteny across the grass family  <cit> . to foster the development of b. distachyon as a grass model and coordinate the development of its genomics resources, the international brachypodium initiative was formed . the initiative placed a high priority on the development of a global physical map of diploid b. distachyon composed of large genomic fragments cloned in a bacterial artificial chromosome vector  . a high resolution bac-based physical map has many genomics applications including analyzing genome structure, conducting genome-wide comparisons, and facilitating the assembly of b. distachyon genome sequence.

the development of a brachypodium bac-based physical map is reported here. also reported is a global comparison of the map with rice genome sequence  <cit>  and wheat deletion bin maps  <cit>  with the goal to obtain a clearer picture of b. distachyon genome structure and evolutionary history and their relationships to those of rice and wheat.

RESULTS
bac source, fingerprinting, and contig assembly
a total of  <dig>  clones of hindiii and bamhi bac libraries developed from the diploid b. distachyon accession bd <dig>  <cit>  were fingerprinted using the snapshot hicf bac fingerprinting method  <cit> . to generate more information about each clone, a gs1200liz size standard, which allows sizing of restriction fragments up to  <dig>  bp , was used. the use of gs1200liz necessitated using the 50-cm capillary array for the abi 3730xl, instead of the standard 36-cm capillary array that is used for electrophoresis of fragments ranging from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp  <cit> . large-size fragments are less frequent than small-size fragments in the snapshot hicf profiles , and are more valuable in contig assembly because they are less likely to be shared by chance  <cit> . since more large fragments could be called using the gs1200liz as size standard, fragments with size less than  <dig> bp were not used for contig assembly in this study.

cross-contamination and low quality fingerprinting data interfere with accurate contig assembly  <cit> . contaminated clones, empty clones, small insert clones, and clones with fingerprints below specified quality threshold were eliminated with the genoprofiler program  <cit> . of the  <dig>  fingerprinted clones,  <dig>  clones  were suitable for contig assembly. an average fingerprint had  <dig>  restriction fragments in this population of fingerprints. since the average insert size was  <dig> kb  <cit> , there was on the average a restriction fragment every  <dig>  kb.

the  <dig>  fingerprints representing 14× b. distachyon genome equivalents were used for an initial automated contig assembly using the fpc software  <cit> . the initial assembly was performed at a relatively high stringency  to minimize faulty contig assembly of clones from unrelated regions of the genome. the "dqer" function was used to dissemble contigs containing more than 10% questionable  clones. the "end to end" fpc function was then repeatedly employed to merge contigs with successively less stringent sulston score cutoff values  <cit> . in the end, the fpc assembly resulted in  <dig> contigs containing a total of  <dig>  bac clones. in this "phase i" physical map,  <dig> contigs had more than  <dig> clones each,  <dig> contigs had  <dig> -  <dig> clones each,  <dig> contigs had  <dig> -  <dig> clones, and the rest had  <dig> clones or less. a total of  <dig>  singletons remained. the cumulative, contiguous, non-redundant fragment count across all contigs was equivalent to approximately  <dig> mb, which was  <dig> % more than the estimated size of b. distachyon genome   <cit> ; if the genome size of  <dig> mb based on the recent release of 8× genome sequence assembly  is used, the fragment count would be equivalent to  <dig> % more of the estimated genome size. this indicated that many contigs actually overlapped other contigs, but the overlaps were below contig joining threshold. such overestimation has been reported in physical maps of other plant genomes  <cit> .

editing of contigs by alignments with the rice genome sequence
integration of molecular markers into contigs is crucial for their anchoring on genetic maps and ultimate alignment of a physical map and genome sequence. this task can be accomplished by screening bac libraries with pools of labeled probes derived from est clones or mapped genetic markers or screening of multidimensional pools of bac clones by pcr or highly parallel illumina goldengate assays  <cit> . bac end sequences , in addition to other genomic applications  <cit> , can facilitate initial genome characterization  <cit>  and anchoring of contigs onto the genetic map. bess are particularly useful for contig anchoring in small, gene-dense genomes. their utility is diminished in large and complex genomes due to a low gene density. for example, in wheat, over 80% of the genome consists of repetitive dna . akhunov et al.  <cit>  reported that coding sequences accounted for only  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> % of bes in t. uratu, ae. speltoides, and ae. tauschii bac libraries, respectively. a total of  <dig> mb of random b. distachyon genomic sequence was generated by sequencing  <dig>  bac ends from the two bac libraries, representing ~ <dig> % of the genome sequence on the basis of a genome size of  <dig> mb . this was equivalent to one sequence tag every  <dig>  kb . a total of  <dig> % of repeat-masked b. distachyon bess had matches to the rice genome sequence . among them,  <dig>  also matched wheat ests  <cit> . therefore, the integration of b. distachyon bes into the contigs immediately anchored a large number of contigs onto the rice genome sequence and wheat deletion maps .

bes of fingerprinted clones facilitated manual editing and contig assembly validation. this was based on the assumption that closely related grass genomes share extensive colinearity. the colinearity of contigs with the rice genome can be used to assess quality of snapshot-based bac fingerprinting technology and contig assembly. brachypodium contigs with bess allowed for direct alignment of contigs with rice pseudomolecules; blat  <cit>  was used for finding sequence similarities, which were then used by symap  for computing the synteny blocks and visualizing the results . these alignments were used to guide contig editing and disjoining, as it was inevitable that miss-assembled bac contigs occurred due to a number of factors including chimeric clones and cross-contamination. in addition, contig merging was performed with successively increasing cutoffs , so it was likely that some merging could result in false joining of two unrelated regions. we used alignments with the rice genome as reference to provide supporting evidence during disjoining problem contigs. during contig editing, when two merged contigs aligned to two different regions in the rice genome, the merge was rejected and the merged contigs were disjoined. the same strategy can be applied to miss-assembled contigs. when a contig is aligned to different rice genomic regions, the contig should be further evaluated to identify potential assembly problems. for example, in the initial assembly, contig <dig> was aligned to two genomic blocks on rice chromosome  <dig>  separated by over  <dig> mb . it was found that the contig contained two clusters linked by two bac clones, db064d <dig> and db064f <dig>  these two clones reside near each other in a 96-well plate, indicating that cross-contamination may have occurred during fingerprinting process  and probably resulted in two shared fingerprint profiles just below the predefined contamination threshold. contig  <dig> was disjoined into two after removing the two clones during the contig editing process.

the integration of bes into contigs and manual editing of contigs using rice genome as a reference improved contig assembly by disjoining  <dig> contigs. the final assembly contained  <dig> contigs, which included bess. this assembly is called "phase ii physical map" of the b. distachyon genome. figure  <dig> shows an example of a contig in the phase ii physical map. the view of the complete set of b. distachyon contigs is available at .

comparison of b. distachyon contigs with the rice genome
the alignment of contigs of the phase ii b. distachyon physical map to the rice genome sequence estimated the genome coverage. a total of  <dig> contigs  could be aligned to the rice genome sequence. they covered  <dig> mb  of the rice genome sequence  and represented 88% of the total b. distachyon fpc map as measured by cb units. when only contigs with more than  <dig> clones were used,  <dig> out of  <dig>  could be aligned to the rice genome. although  <dig> contigs could not be anchored, these contigs were generally small, and the total number of clones in them equaled to only  <dig>   out of the total  <dig>  clones, indicating that only a small portion of the clones could not been anchored onto the rice genome. the data suggested a general conservation of synteny between rice and b. distachyon genomes, which confirms previous conclusions made on the basis of sequencing a few b. sylvaticum bac clones and their sequence comparisons with the orthologous regions in rice and wheat  <cit> .

ideally, b. distachyon contigs should be ordered using a high-resolution genetic map. such a map was not available to us. however, the symap alignment of the fpc contigs onto the sequenced rice chromosomes ordered many of the contigs into synteny blocks with putative chromosome assignments and showed extensive colinearity of contigs with the rice genome sequences. for instance, contig  <dig> appeared to be highly colinear with a 7-mb region in rice chromosome  <dig> although several small local inversions could be identified . out of  <dig> bess in this contig homologous to the rice genome sequence,  <dig>  were homologous to sequences in this region on rice chromosome  <dig>  while  <dig> were homologous with sequences in different regions of the rice genome, presumably representing non-colinear genes. previous alignment of ten sequenced b. distachyon bac clones with the orthologous rice regions also revealed a general synteny conservation between rice and b. distachyon  <cit> . it was found that 15% b. distachyon and 19% rice genes were not present in the corresponding orthologous regions  <cit> . the non-colinear genes reflect the divergence of the two genomes after the split from a common ancestor during phylogeny of the grass family  <cit> .

a symap dot-plot  shows correspondence of most b. distachyon contigs to specific regions of the rice genomic sequence. this is consistent with the estimation that the b. distachyon contigs cover  <dig> mb or ~88% of the rice genome. a question remains whether or not these alignments provide evidence of general colinearity between rice and b. distachyon chromosomes. although the b. distachyon contigs are not ordered, the following line of reasoning suggests that the b. distachyon and rice chromosomes are highly collinear. differences in gene order between b. distachyon and rice due to inversions or translocations would be detected in b. distachyon bac contigs as breaks in co-linearity not associated with week joins . fourteen such genuine breaks in colinearity are expected between the two genomes reflecting the difference in chromosome number; x =  <dig> in rice to x =  <dig> in b. distachyon. of the  <dig> contigs having more than  <dig> clones ,  <dig> may have such colinearity breaks. if  <dig> are due to chromosome number differences, this leaves only  <dig> contigs, or 5% of the total  <dig> contigs to be potentially due to actual or artifactual breaks in colinearity. since there is no compelling reason why breaks in gene colinearity should coincide with gaps between bac contigs, we therefore conclude that b. distachyon and rice chromosomes are highly colinear and most of the neighboring contigs on the dot-plot alignment in figure 5a are good candidates for joining.

most plant genomes are paleopolyploid with ancient whole-genome duplications  <cit> . the radiation of grasses was preceded by paleotetraploidy resulting in a whole-genome duplication  <cit> , which was followed by diploidization by deletions. therefore, in regions that are still duplicated in the b. distachyon genome, a rice region will align strongly with one b. distachyon contig block and weakly with another. this is evident in figure 5b, where two b. distachyon syntenic contig blocks can be identified for several rice chromosomes. these data show that the b. distachyon genome has a similar set of duplications derived from the ancient paleotetraploid as does rice.

alignment of wheat est deletion bin map to b. distachyon contigs
the 1c nucleus of hexaploid t. aestivum contains  <dig>  mb dna  <cit> , which makes map-based cloning of wheat genes very difficult. because b. distachyon diverged from the wheat phylogenetic lineage only about  <dig> million years ago   <cit> , b. distachyon physical map and ultimately genome sequence can facilitate wheat map-based cloning and other genomic applications.

a total of  <dig>  expressed sequence tag  unigenes were previously mapped into  <dig> deletion bins, providing a genome-wide framework for wheat mapping and identifying agronomically important genes  <cit> . however, a disadvantage of the deletion bin map is that loci are not ordered within the bins. given the general colinearity among the grass genomes, this problems can be partially overcome by in silico ordering of wheat ests using rice genomic sequence  <cit> . brachypodium is expected to show better synteny with wheat than rice because it diverged from wheat more recently than rice  <cit> , brachypodium is therefore expected to be more useful in comparative mapping applications than rice.

to assess the utility of b. distachyon physical map for wheat genomics, we compared the brachypodium contigs with the wheat deletion bin map  <cit> . of  <dig>  deletion bin mapped wheat ests,  <dig> matched brachypodium bess at an e-value cutoff of 1× 10- <dig>  these matches were derived from bess associated with  <dig> contigs . such analysis allowed us to align brachypodium contigs onto individual chromosomes based on wheat deletion bin map data .

comparison of brachypodium contigs with the wheat deletion bin map and the rice genome sequence provided a genome-wide view of genome evolution among these species. figure  <dig> shows an example of such a comparison. contig <dig> contained  <dig>  bac clones with  <dig>  bess and spanned  <dig>  mb . a total of  <dig> wheat ests in the deletion bins matched bess in this contig. eight of them were mapped in the distal bins 1as3- <dig> - <dig> , 1as1- <dig> - <dig> , 1bs.sat18- <dig> - <dig> , 1bs.sat19- <dig> . <dig> , 1bs.sat19- <dig> - <dig> , 1bs.sat- <dig> , 1bs9- <dig> - <dig> , 1ds5- <dig> - <dig> , 1ds1- <dig> - <dig> , and 1ds3- <dig> - <dig>  on wheat chromosomes 1a, 1b, and 1d  <cit>  . they were distributed across two to three bins on each chromosome, indicating that the contig spans multiple bins on wheat group  <dig> chromosomes . in most cases, the order of bess in a contig homologous to wheat ests correlated with the order of bins along a chromosome arm into which these ests were mapped. these data suggested that contig <dig> represented an orthologous region of these deletion bins. alignment with rice genome indicated that contig <dig> was colinear with a region on rice chromosome  <dig>  among eight colinear wheat ests between brachypodium and wheat, three ests  were not colinear with the rice orthologous region. bf <dig> and bg <dig> were homologous to genes on rice chromosome  <dig>  suggesting gene duplication/deletion either in rice or in the pooideae lineage after pooideae diverged from ehrhartoideae but before divergence of brachypodium. no match to be <dig> was found in the rice genome based on blast searches.

ests bf <dig> and be <dig> homologous to bes sequences of contig <dig> also have no match in the rice genome, but were mapped on long arms of wheat chromosomes of homeologous groups  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. these genes are only present in brachypodium and wheat but are not located in colinear positions in the two genomes. another est locus, bm <dig>  is colinear only between brachypodium and rice since this est was mapped to the chromosome 3b in wheat based on the wheat deletion bin map result. two ests, bf <dig> and bg <dig>  at the top of contig <dig> were mapped to the short arm on wheat chromosomes of homeologous group  <dig>  in rice, they matched sequences on chromosome  <dig>  other examples of noncolinear genes among the three genomes were observed. occasional perturbations of synteny between brachypodium, rice and wheat must therefore be expected and taken into account in comparative genomic applications. since synteny of wheat chromosomes has been eroded faster in the distal regions than in proximal regions  <cit> , perturbed synteny should be expected particularly in genomic comparisons with brachypodium involving distal regions of wheat chromosomes. synteny perturbations observed in contig  <dig> exemplify this reality since the contig is orthologous to a distal region of the short arm of chromosome  <dig> 

to further expand the utility of the brachypodium physical map, we integrated wheat ests that have not been placed into wheat deletion bins into brachypodium contigs. there are over one million wheat ests in genbank, and they have been assembled into  <dig>  unigene sets . using blat,  <dig>  different unigenes were integrated to the brachypodium contigs. they were homologous to a total of  <dig>  bes in the physical map. these wheat est markers will further facilitate comparative mapping in wheat. the comparison of brachypodium contigs with wheat deletion maps and integration of wheat unigenes into brachypodium contigs can be accessed at .

CONCLUSIONS
a whole-genome, bac-based physical map for the new grass model species, brachypodium, was constructed. the map facilitated a variety of genomic applications. comparison of contigs with rice revealed high colinearity between rice and brachypodium chromosomes. additionally, many brachypodium bac contigs could be anchored on the wheat deletion bin maps. both outcomes support the anticipated utility of brachypodium for wheat comparative genomics and practical applications in map-based cloning of wheat genes. another application of the physical map is in the brachypodium genome sequencing project. the phase ii physical map can be aligned with shotgun sequence contigs via bes and provide scaffolds for ordering shotgun sequence contigs and estimating gap sizes. the bac-based physical map reported here was provided to the brachypodium distachyon sequence assembly team and has helped produce a high quality final sequence assembly . the physical map can also identify bacs spanning sequence gaps and has served as sequencing template to fill them. brachypodium is expected to serve as a surrogate to assist gene discovery and functional characterization in the large and complex crop genomes, such as wheat and bioenergy crops. all the data and resources developed in this study are available at the  website for community use.
