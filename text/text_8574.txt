BACKGROUND
nitrogen-fixing symbiotic bacteria, commonly known as rhizobia, employ a variety of strategies which allow them to exist in the soil and adapt to various environmental conditions prior to infecting leguminous plant hosts. rhizobial cell surface components, exopolysaccharide  and lipopolysaccharide , play an important role in determining the symbiotic competence of rhizobia, root tissue invasion and induction of nitrogen-fixing nodules on host plants forming indeterminate-type nodules, such as pisum, trifolium, vicia, and medicago spp.  <cit> . acidic epss secreted in large amounts by rhizobia are species-specific compounds consisting of common sugars substituted with non-carbohydrate residues  <cit> . eps of rhizobium leguminosarum is a heteropolymer consisting of octasaccharide subunits composed of five glucose residues, one galactose, and two glucuronic acid residues, additionally decorated with acetyl, pyruvyl, and 3-hydroxybutyryl groups  <cit> . eps-deficient mutants or those with an altered lps structure are impaired in nodule cell invasion and nitrogen fixation  <cit> . biosynthesis of eps in r. leguminosarum is a multi-step process requiring the expression of several pss genes, located in the major eps cluster on the chromosome  <cit> . this region includes pss genes encoding specific glycosyl transferases, epimerases and deacetylases involved in the biosynthesis of eps repeating units, genes encoding proteins engaged in the polymerization and transport of eps, and other genes that code for eps modifying enzymes  <cit> . as has been established for r. leguminosarum and sinorhizobium  meliloti, eps plays an important role in biofilm development, being the major matrix component  <cit> . a mutation in r. leguminosarum pssa encoding the first ip-glucosyl transferase essential for eps synthesis completely abolishes biofilm development  <cit> . glycanases plya and plyb secreted via the prsd-prse type i secretion system are responsible for eps modification and biofilm formation. plya and plyb cleave mature eps. exopolysaccharides produced by prsd, plyb, and plybplya mutants form significantly longer polymers than the wild type  <cit> . besides glycanases, rapc, rapa <dig>  and rapa <dig> agglutinins engaged in the adhesion and aggregation of rhizobia are secreted via the prsd-prse type i secretion system  <cit> .

in a previous study, a rosr gene encoding a positive transcriptional regulator of eps synthesis was identified in r. leguminosarum bv. trifolii  <cit> . the chromosomally located rosr shares significant identity with rosr of rhizobium etli  <cit> , mucr of sinorhizobium meliloti  <cit> , ros of agrobacterium tumefaciens  <cit> , and rosar of agrobacterium radiobacter  <cit> . transcriptional regulators encoded by these genes belong to the family of ros/mucr proteins which possess a cys2his <dig> type zinc-finger motif and are involved in positive or negative regulation of eps synthesis. a genome-wide genetic screening has revealed that r. etli rosr affects the expression of about fifty genes, among them those responsible for the synthesis, polymerization, and transport of surface polysaccharides  <cit> . rosr of r. leguminosarum bv. trifolii encodes a protein of  <dig> aa  containing a zinc-finger motif in its c-terminal domain that binds a 22-bp-long consensus sequence called the rosr-box, which is located in the rosr upstream region. besides the rosr-box, several regulatory sites have been identified in the rosr upstream region, including two p <dig> and p <dig> promoters and three motifs resembling the e. coli camp-crp binding site, indicating a complex regulation of rosr expression  <cit> . rosr binding to the rosr-box negatively regulates transcription of its own gene  <cit> . in the presence of glucose, the transcriptional activity of the rosr is significantly reduced, showing that the expression of this gene is regulated by catabolic repression.

rosr mutation in r. leguminosarum bv. trifolii causes a substantially diminished eps production and ineffective symbiosis with clover  <cit> . in contrast, although an r. etli rosr mutant also formed colonies with altered morphology, it retained the ability to elicit nitrogen-fixing nodules on phaseolus vulgaris, which forms determinate-type nodules  <cit> . the nodulation competitiveness of this mutant, however, was greatly reduced and, for this reason, rosr was assumed to be a determinant of r. etli competitiveness.

in this study, we describe pleiotropic phenotypes of rosr mutants, which are characterized by an increased sensitivity to osmotic stresses, detergents, and antibiotics that affect peptidoglycan synthesis. these mutants produce significantly less eps than the wild type and form an altered biofilm on polystyrene surfaces. moreover, the mutation in rosr affects symbiotic performance, strikingly decreasing bacterial attachment to clover root hairs and formation of infection threads.

RESULTS
r. leguminosarum bv. trifolii rosr mutants
recently, we described r. leguminosarum bv. trifolii  <dig>  derivatives mutated in the rosr open reading frame   <cit> . in this study, using integrative mutagenesis, the rt <dig> mutant was constructed in which a fragment containing the 5'-end regulatory region and the first  <dig> nucleotide triplets for rosr was integrated  <dig> bp upstream of genomic rosr orf, just before the p <dig> promoter . we wanted to examine the effect of duplication of regulatory sequences consisting of two rosr-boxes, which constitute the sites of interaction with the zinc finger motif of the rosr transcription factor, on several phenotypic and symbiotic properties of the mutant.

the two previously described rosr mutants  were also evaluated in some assays . the rt <dig> mutant has  <dig> bp deletion  in rosr orf, resulting in a frameshift mutation and a subsequent synthesis of rosr with a non-native amino acid sequence downstream of the mutation  <cit> . the rt <dig> mutant was obtained by gene replacement mutagenesis using the mini-tn <dig> transposon inserted between 151- <dig> nt of rosr orf  <cit> .

r. leguminosarum rosr mutants are defective in symbiotic efficiency and competitiveness
all rosr mutants demonstrated similar colony phenotypes; they formed characteristic dry, wrinkled colonies with many clumps on 79ca agar medium . clover inoculated with the rosr mutants formed nodules with a 7-day delay, and their number was about two-fold lower in comparison to the wild type . inoculated plants turned yellowish, which indicated inefficient symbiosis, and the fresh mass of shoots was, on average,  <dig> % of the aerial parts of plants inoculated with rt <dig> . irrespective of the type of rosr mutation, wild type copies of rosr carried on the low-copy plasmid prc <dig> fully complemented the mutation. transconjugants were mucoid , and clover inoculated with the clones demonstrated symbiotic phenotypes similar to the wild type .

a plants were harvested  <dig> days after inoculation. given values  are averages of three independent experiments with  <dig> plants for each treatment.

b - exopolysaccharide  production .

to study the competitive ability of the rt <dig> and the rt <dig> mutants, clover seedlings were inoculated with mixtures of each rosr mutant with rt <dig>  wild type in various proportions. for both mutants, in the case of a 1: <dig> strain ratio, the nodules were colonized exclusively by the rt <dig>  wild type. in 10: <dig>  100: <dig>  and 1000: <dig> strain mixtures, the percentage of nodules occupied by the rt <dig> mutant was 1%,  <dig> % and 9% of the sampled nodules, respectively . the rt <dig> mutant demonstrated a similar decrease in competitiveness: the percentages of occupied nodules were 1%,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % in the 10: <dig>  100: <dig>  and 1000: <dig> mixtures, respectively. the results indicated that rosr mutation substantially reduced the nodulation competitiveness of r. leguminosarum bv. trifolii  <dig> .

rosr mutants are altered in surface polysaccharides
non-mucoid colonies formed by the rosr mutants indicated that the strains produced reduced amounts of surface polysaccharides. the amounts of eps secreted by rt <dig>  rt <dig> and rt <dig> were estimated to be about 30% of the amount formed by the wild type . rt <dig>  bearing a truncated rosr and an additional wild type copy of the gene, demonstrated the negative dominant nature of rosr mutation.

to test the negative dominant effect on eps production observed in rt <dig>  plasmids containing different fragments of the regulatory region and rosr were constructed on pbbr1mcs backbone and introduced into rt <dig>  . the pex <dig> plasmid containing the same fragment as in the rt <dig> mutant genome exerted a strong negative effect on eps production, decreasing eps synthesis to 54% of the control . rt <dig> , containing exclusively the rosr upstream region with the rosr-box, produced 64% eps of the wild type strain, but rt <dig> , which contained only the shortened rosr orf, produced 88% of rt <dig>  eps. only after introducing full-length copies of rosr into rt <dig>  , the negative dominant effect had been overcome, with the increase of eps synthesis up to 183% of the control. these results suggested that additional copies of the rosr upstream region with the rosr-box sequence, rather than rosr protein deprived of the c-terminal dna binding domain, affected the level of eps production. most likely, the positive regulation of eps synthesis by rosr depends on an equilibrium between rosr regulatory sequences and the amount of rosr. these results explain, to some extent, the phenotype of the rt <dig> mutant.

epss isolated from the rt <dig>  wild type and rt <dig> and rt <dig> rosr mutants were fractionated by gel permeation chromatography on a bio-gel a-5m column, and two fractions of eps with significantly different molecular weights were obtained . the ratio of high-molecular-weight  to low-molecular-weight  fractions was 68%:32% in the eps of rt <dig>  wild type. in the rt <dig> and rt <dig> rosr mutants, a considerable change was observed in the hmw to lmw eps ratio in favor of hmw, i.e., 79%:21% and 76%:24%, respectively. to establish the sugar composition of eps of the wild type and the rosr mutant, peak samples from bio-gel a-5m chromatography  were evaluated for monosaccharide composition by gc-ms. the glucose/glucuronic acid/galactose ratio was found to be approximately 5:2: <dig>  which is characteristic of the acidic eps of r. leguminosarum . additionally, non-carbohydrate substituents in the eps of rt <dig> and rt <dig>  wild type were determined . eps secreted by the rosr mutant had a lower level of o-acetyl and 3-hydroxybutyryl substitutions and slightly more pyruvyl substitutions in relation to the wild type eps .

to investigate whether the rosr mutation affected lps synthesis, lpss from rt <dig> , rt <dig>  and rt <dig> were analyzed by sds-page . the lps of rt <dig>  wild type separated into two intense bands: fast-migrating lps ii representing lipid a and the core oligosaccharide, and slow-migrating lps i carrying the o antigen  <cit> . the appearance of faintly stained bands in the upper region of the gel indicated the presence of lps forms with o-chains composed of more polymerized repeating units. lps of rt <dig> had a similar profile; however, the intensity of the individual bands was much weaker than for rt <dig>  . high-molecular-weight lps  from the rosr mutant migrated slightly faster than lps i of the wild type. in order to assign these changes, the glycosyl compositions of polysaccharides  obtained from the wild type and the rt <dig> mutant lpss by mild acid hydrolysis were examined . it was established that the sugar composition of both pss was the same, although some differences in the amounts of individual components  were observed. the ratio of l-rhamnose to 6- l-deoxytalose was 1: <dig> in ps of the rosr mutant as compared to 2: <dig> in the wild type ps. our preliminary results  indicate that l-rhamnose and 6-l-deoxytalose are compounds of both o-chain repeating units and a non-repeating glycosyl sequence of the outer core region.

r. leguminosarum rosr mutants are more sensitive to some antibiotics, detergents, and osmotic stresses
to further characterize the rosr mutants, their sensitivity to a wide range of antibiotics, including those responsible for cell wall and protein synthesis inhibition, was examined . the rt <dig> and rt <dig> mutants demonstrated similar antibiotic sensitivity profiles. the most remarkable difference in their antibiotic sensitivity in relation to the wild type was a  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold increase in susceptibility to beta-lactams, such as carbenicillin, ampicillin, and penicillin g, which impair peptidoglycan synthesis. also, a slight increase in the sensitivity to polymyxin b , tetracycline, and chloramphenicol was detected . the data suggested some changes in the cell envelope structure of the rosr mutants; specifically, the alteration in the lps and eps profiles could affect cell wall permeability and, consequently, lead to an increase in susceptibility to several antibiotics  <cit> .

to study the possible cell envelope disturbances linked to the rosr mutation, assays of sensitivity to detergents and ethanol were conducted . in the presence of sds, doc, and ethanol, significant differences in the growth of the rosr mutants in relation to the parental strain were observed, except for rt <dig>  for which growth was moderately inhibited by ethanol .

* - strains were grown in ty supplemented with  <dig> mm nacl  or gym medium  supplemented with dilworth's vitamins for  <dig> days, and the growth was compared with that of strains grown in ty medium. od <dig> values were measured. percentage growth values are the mean and sd from three independent trials.

† difference between the wild type and the rosr mutants is statistically significant at p <  <dig>  .

the rosr mutants were also significantly more sensitive to hyper- and hypo-osmotic stress than the wild type . the mutants achieved only 10-12% of the growth in ty medium supplemented with  <dig> mm nacl  when compared to a control medium without nacl. the growth of the rosr mutants was also significantly diminished in relation to the wild type strain in hypo-osmotic gym medium. the higher sensitivity of the rosr mutants to hypo-osmotic stress might be explained by an increased permeability of their cell membranes allowing greater amounts of neutral polysaccharide  to be excreted  <cit> . taken together, rosr mutation seems to affect membrane integrity, resulting in an altered sensitivity to detergents, ethanol, and osmotic stresses.

changes in membrane and extracellular protein profiles of the rosr mutant in relation to the wild type
to examine the role of rosr in the putative membrane leakage, membrane and extracellular proteins of rt <dig> and rt <dig>  grown in ty medium were compared by sds-page . some differences in membrane protein profiles were observed, such as two abundant bands with an estimated mass of ~ <dig> kda and one band of ~ <dig> kda in rt <dig>  in contrast, the amounts of proteins of ~ <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> kda were significantly diminished in this mutant. based on the literature data, the masses of these three proteins corresponded to mature proteins ropb <dig> , ropa , and ropa <dig> , which had been identified in r. leguminosarum  <cit> .

an extracellular protein profile of r. leguminosarum bv. trifolii  <dig>  was very similar to that of r. leguminosarum bv. viciae  <dig>  <cit> . in extracelullar protein profiles of rt <dig>  and rt <dig>  besides several bands common to both supernatants, a protein of ~ <dig> kda was uniquely present, and a protein of ~ <dig> kda was significantly more abundant in the rosr mutant supernatant . on the other hand, the amounts of proteins of about  <dig> kda were drastic diminished in the rt <dig> culture supernatant. the differences in protein patterns between the wild type and the rosr mutant indicated that some additional proteins were being secreted from the cells, perhaps as a result of unspecific membrane leakage, possibly due to changes in membrane permeability triggered by the mutation.

to study the effect of clover root exudates on the protein profiles of rt <dig> and rt <dig> , the strains were cultured in m <dig> medium with or without  <dig> μm exudates, and membrane and extracellular proteins were isolated . it was observed that this culture medium influenced both extracellular and membrane proteins when compared to ty grown cultures. most apparent differences were found for secreted proteins. for rt <dig> and rt <dig> , proteins of about  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda  present in ty supernatants were absent when these strains grew in m <dig>  on the other hand, additional proteins were present in m <dig> supernatants. some differences between the rosr mutant and the wild type were detected in the proteins from m <dig> supernatants. however, the effect of root exudates on extracellular protein profiles was not noticeable.

in membrane proteins, a major difference concerned two proteins of ~ <dig> kda and ~ <dig> kda, which were present in both strains grown in ty medium but were missing in the m <dig> grown cultures . no visible differences in protein profiles were detected between these two strains grown in m <dig> and in the presence of root exudates.

the purity of the membrane and the extracellular protein fractions isolated from rt <dig> and rt <dig>  was assayed by western blotting with anti-pssb and anti-pssn antisera specific to r. leguminosarum . pssb, previously described as cytoplasmic inositol monophosphatase present in two forms of  <dig> and  <dig>  kda, was used as a marker of cytoplasmic proteins  <cit> , and pssn lipoprotein  as a marker of membrane proteins  <cit> . no substantial contamination of membrane and extracellular protein fractions by this cytoplasmic protein was detected . for pssn, besides a strong signal in membrane fractions, residual signals were also detected in the cytoplasmic fraction and extracellular proteins of rt <dig>  grown in m <dig> . this finding was in agreement with the previously described detection of low amounts of pssn in the culture supernatant  <cit> .

to identify the individual membrane and extracellular proteins of the rosr mutant that differed in abundance from those of the wild type strain, we submitted them to edman degradation sequencing. unfortunately, possibly due to blocked n-terminus of the proteins, only the protein of  <dig> kda that was less abundant in the rosr mutant ty medium membrane fraction, was identified by this method. the sequence of the  <dig> n-terminal amino acids  showed 100% identity to the 25- <dig> aa region of the ompa-like protein of r. leguminosarum bv. trifolii wsm <dig> , the outer membrane protein ropb <dig> of r. etli cfn <dig> , and ropb <dig> of r. etli ciat <dig> .

r. leguminosarum bv. trifolii rosr mutants are altered in motility and biofilm formation
the effect of rosr mutation on the motility of r. leguminosarum was assessed  and a very strong inhibition of motility in the studied mutant strains was observed. the swimming zones were from 2-  to  <dig> -fold smaller  than for rt <dig>  wild type following growth on m <dig> semisolid medium for  <dig> h. the rt <dig> strain, entirely deficient in eps synthesis due to a mutation in pssa encoding a glucosyl-ip-transferase, showed a similar motility-deficient phenotype. complementation of the rosr mutation with prc <dig> carrying wild type rosr fully restored the swimming radius of rt <dig>  the results demonstrate that the rosr mutation negatively affected mutant motility.

to determine whether the rosr mutation affected biofilm formation, growth of the wild type and the rosr mutants was analyzed in m <dig> in a microtiter plate assay. this medium was used in an attempt to reflect soil conditions where nutrients are usually scarce. in the assay, the mass of biofilm formed by the rosr mutants, as measured by crystal violet binding, was substantially lower, i.e., 37%  and 45% , respectively, in relation to the wild type . the r. leguminosarum bv. trifolii pssa mutant, included in this assay, formed only 18% of the wild type biofilm, which confirms the earlier observations on biofilm formation by an r. leguminosarum bv. viciae pssa mutant  <cit> . complementation of rosr mutation with prc <dig> restored biofilm development to the wild type levels .

the rosr mutant  and the wild type strain were chosen to examine the organization and viability of r. leguminosarum bv. trifolii cells in biofilm. the organization of adherent bacteria on plastic surfaces differed substantially between the wild type and the mutant . after four days of growth, the rt <dig>  formed a typical mature biofilm with water channels. the parameters describing the biofilms formed by the wild type and the rosr mutant are listed in table  <dig>  the rosr mutant developed a biofilm which was nearly two times thinner than the wild type's, and which was unorganized and impaired in maturation, with a significantly lower number of viable cells. complementation of the rosr mutant with prc <dig> restored the wild type phenotype, and rt <dig> formed a mature biofilm with highly viable bacteria, comparable to the wild type .

† difference between the wild type and the rosr mutant is statistically significant at p <  <dig>  .

effect of clover root exudates on growth of rosr mutants and eps production
the increased sensitivity of the rosr mutants to surface active compounds  and some antibiotics, most probably caused by changes in membrane protein profiles , inclined us to assess the effect of clover root exudates on growth of the rosr mutants. the strains were grown in m <dig> medium supplemented with  <dig> μm root exudates, and aliquots of the cultures were plated in dilutions on 79ca medium. clover root exudates slightly enhanced the growth of the rt <dig>  wild type . the rosr mutants  grew significantly slower than the wild type in m <dig> medium and were more sensitive to the root exudates . in the presence of the exudates, rt <dig>  produced a significantly increased amount of eps, whereas the level of eps produced by the rosr mutants was increased only slightly .

phenotype analysis of a rosr mutant using biolog tests
in several experiments, we noticed that the rosr mutants grew slower than the wild type both in liquid and solid media, suggesting changes in their metabolic capabilities. in an attempt to define the phenotype profile of the rosr mutant  in relation to the wild type strain, the pm system  was used  <cit> . pm <dig>  pm2a, pm3b, and pm4a plates were chosen, allowing for examination of the utilization of  <dig> different carbon sources and  <dig> nitrogen,  <dig> phosphorus, and  <dig> sulfur sources. in addition, pm <dig> plates were used to test the growth under various stress conditions.

in general, the rosr mutant utilized fewer energy sources and was significantly more sensitive to the majority of the tested osmolytes than the wild type . the most visible differences were observed in utilization of carbon and nitrogen sources . mutant rt <dig> utilized several carbon and nitrogen sources two to four times less efficiently than the parental strain. in contrast, utilization of some amino acids, pyruvic acid, and 2-aminoethanol  by the rosr mutant was considerably higher than for the wild type. moreover, nine of the tested sugar sources and twelve of the nitrogen sources were not utilized by the rosr mutant  .

the phenotype of the rt <dig> mutant did not differ essentially from the wild type with regard to utilization of phosphorus sources  except that they were metabolized less effectively. it is worth noting that the rt <dig> significantly better utilized sulfur sources, such as l-cysteine, l-cysteic acid, and s-methyl-l-cysteine , than the wild type. this suggests derepression of the sulfur metabolic pathway in the rosr mutant background.

pm <dig> microplates were used to determine the sensitivity of the rosr mutant to several osmolytes. we observed a significant increase in rosr mutant sensitivity in the presence of nacl, na3po <dig>  2so <dig>  and nano <dig>  in contrast to the wild type, rt <dig> did not survive in  <dig> mm na3po <dig>   <dig> mm 2so <dig>   <dig> mm nano <dig>  and  <dig> mm nano <dig> .

in summary, the rosr mutant was impaired in its ability to utilize several compounds and exhibited an increased sensitivity to some osmolytes, suggesting a role of rosr protein in the control of many essential metabolic processes.

effect of rosr mutation on root hair attachment and infection
the rosr mutants formed significantly fewer nodules on clover roots than the wild type strain and their appearance was delayed . this might indicate a failure in the first stages of mutant strain's interaction with the roots. to visualize root hair attachment of rhizobia and their ability to grow on the root surface and infect root hairs, the rt <dig>  and rt <dig> strains harbouring plasmid phc <dig> with constitutively expressed gfp  <cit>  were used. clover seedlings inoculated with the bacteria on fåhraeus medium-covered microscope slides were observed in the course of time. after the first  <dig> min, single rt <dig>  cells were visible on the surface of root hairs . after  <dig> h, attachment of numerous rt <dig>  cells to root hairs was seen. bacteria were located mainly on root hair tops, forming caps and rhizobial clouds . in the zone of growing root hairs, the majority of the root hairs were coated with rt <dig>  cells . after  <dig> days post infection , infection threads inside some of the root hairs were initiated or already extended and reached root epidermal cells . in contrast, rt <dig> cells were seen on the root surface but were attached to the root hairs only sporadically demonstrating a much weaker attachment ability . the caps formed by rosr cells on the top of root hairs were detected very rarely . in addition, several root hairs had an atypical, expanded shape resembling ginger roots  in contrast to the typical curled root hairs in clover inoculated with the wild type. in the case of rosr mutant-inoculated plants, infection threads inside root hairs were observed sporadically, and their elongation was frequently interrupted .

to quantitatively determine the attachment ability to the surface of clover roots, rt <dig>  wild type, rt <dig> and rt <dig> rosr mutants, and their derivatives bearing plasmid prc <dig> were incubated with clover roots for  <dig>  h and  <dig> h. the wild type cells showed a high attachment ability to the root surface . in contrast, the number of rt <dig> and rt <dig> cells attached to roots during  <dig>  h was drastically lower . after  <dig> h, the rosr mutant cells were still considerably less numerous than rt <dig>  . these assays confirmed that rosr mutation affects the first step of the infection process, i.e., bacterial adhesion to root hairs .

to study the further stages of clover infection, seedlings were inoculated with rt <dig>  and rt <dig> tagged with gfp and observed under a light microscope during a 10-day experiment. the following were quantified:  tightly curled root hairs containing trapped rhizobia,  initiated  infection threads, and  infection threads which successfully entered the root cortex of clover. as was shown in figure 10j, wild type bacteria effectively colonized curled root hairs, and the first initiated infection threads were observed after  <dig> dpi. extended infection threads were formed from almost all colonized root hairs, giving, on average,  <dig>  successful infections per plant after  <dig> days. the rosr mutant exhibited notable differences in infection thread formation. rt <dig> cells colonized root hairs very rarely and with a delay in comparison to the wild type. as a consequence, the initiation of infection threads was observed only occasionally and a great majority of the infection threads was not properly extended and did not reach root cortical cells .

discussion
in this paper, we present data showing that rosr of r. leguminosarum bv. trifolii  <dig> , besides its role in transcriptional regulation of eps synthesis, is required for successful interaction with clover plants, stress tolerance, motility, and biofilm formation. both the rosr mutants  described earlier  <cit>  and the newly isolated rt <dig>  bearing a genomic wild type rosr with the regulatory region in addition to the mutated rosr copy, displayed pleiotropic phenotypes. pleiotropy of the rosr mutants was fully restored in complementation tests using a low-copy plasmid carrying rosr. interestingly, the rt <dig> mutant showed a negative dominant effect on eps production, which confirmed the regulatory role of rosr in eps synthesis. this phenomenon could be explained, to some extent, by negative autoregulation of rosr expression  <cit> , which may be strengthened by the presence of more rosr-boxes binding rosr . as a result, the diminished amount of functional rosr might be insufficient for positive regulation of eps production. the negative dominance could be overcome by introducing additional copies of rosr in the complementation experiments . a similar dominant-negative effect of rosar mutation in a. radiobacter had been described by brightwell et al.  <cit> . the introduction of rosar lacking the 3" terminus on a plasmid into a wild type strain resulted in non-mucoid transconjugants.

all the rosr mutants were considerably impaired in both the level of eps production and the rate of its polymerization. they produced three times less eps which was also slightly changed in non-carbohydrate modification and the level of polymerization. in addition, ps part of rt <dig> lps showed quantitative differences in the sugar composition  in comparison to the wild type ps.

like most r. leguminosarum bv. trifolii mutants deficient in surface polysaccharide production  <cit> , the rosr mutants elicited nodules in which rhizobia did not fix nitrogen. these mutants were also not competitive in relation to the wild type. rt <dig> and rt <dig>  even when present in the inoculum in 1000-fold excess to the wild type, occupied only about 10% of the clover nodules. an r. etli rosr mutant formed colonies with an altered morphology, but retained the ability to elicit nitrogen-fixing nodules on phaseolus vulgaris, which forms determinate-type nodules  <cit> . nevertheless, the nodulation competitiveness of that rosr mutant was greatly reduced and, for this reason, rosr was considered a determinant of r. etli competitiveness.

one of the most striking effects of rosr mutation in r. leguminosarum bv. trifolii is the drastic decrease in attachment to root hairs and growth on the root surface. in contrast to the wild type strain, rosr mutant cells only sporadically formed caps on the top of root hairs, and, consequently, infection threads were initiated rarely, and the majority of them were aborted. recently, a similar effect of r. leguminosarum pssa mutation has been described: the mutant was defective in attachment and biofilm formation both in vitro and on root hairs  <cit> . an r. leguminosarum gmsa mutant, which did not produce glucomannan, demonstrated a very similar symbiotic phenotype to the rosr mutant rt <dig>  it was defective in attachment and biofilm formation on root hairs and was strongly outcompeted by the wild type in mixed inoculations, showing that glucomannan is critical for competitive nodulation  <cit> . in the case of r. leguminosarum cellulose synthesis mutant  only individual cells attached to root hairs, but caps were not formed  <cit> . other eps-deficient mutants such as r. leguminosarum  and s. meliloti  were defective in infection thread formation  <cit> . in s. meliloti, an exoh mutant lacking the succinyl modification in succinoglycan and an exoz mutant producing this heteropolymer without the acetyl modification exhibited a reduced efficiency in the initiation and elongation of infection threads  <cit> . s. meliloti exor and exos mutants overproducing eps i demonstrated a marked reduction in the biosynthesis of flagella resulting in a loss of the ability of the cells to swarm and swim and had a significantly reduced efficiency of root hair colonization  <cit> . in conclusion, defective attachment and infection thread formation in the first stages of symbiosis seem to be common features of rhizobial mutants which produce altered surface polysaccharides and infect plants which form indeterminate-type nodules.

the pleiotropic effect of rosr mutation was also expressed as an increased sensitivity to detergents, hyper- and hypo-osmotic stress, and antibiotics from the beta-lactam group which affect peptidoglycan synthesis. the rt <dig> mutant also exhibited an increased sensitivity to several osmolytes indicating that rosr is engaged in the regulation of many essential cell processes. these changes in the phenotype indicated a direct or indirect effect of rosr mutation, which, presumably, affects membrane integrity or causes outer membrane instability. this was partially evidenced by sds-page of membrane and secreted proteins isolated from the wild type and rosr mutant . we observed some differences in the protein profiles of both strains, especially when they were cultured on ty rich medium. out of the several membrane proteins whose concentrations were significantly decreased in the rosr mutant, three proteins corresponded to outer membrane proteins ropb <dig> , ropa , and ropa <dig>  of r. leguminosarum  <cit> . among them, the  <dig> kda protein was identified as ompa-like ropb <dig>  the diminished amount of this protein in the rosr mutant could influence its membrane integrity and sensitivity to surface-active compounds and some antibiotics. several classes of outer membrane proteins  of r. leguminosarum bv. viciae strain  <dig> had been described as antigens, and the level of some of them significantly decreased during bacteroid differentiation  <cit> . recently, a gene family of omps  in r. leguminosarum bv. viciae vf39sm has been described  <cit> . a ropb mutant was characterized by an increased sensitivity to detergents, hydrophobic antibiotics, and weak organic acids, which suggested a role of ropb in outer membrane stability  <cit> .

extracellular protein profile of r. leguminosarum bv. trifolii  <dig>  wild type growing in ty was very similar to that of r. leguminosarum bv. viciae  <dig> described by krehenbrink and downie  <cit> . significant differences between ty supernatant protein profiles of the rt <dig>  and the rt <dig> were observed. the main difference was essentially diminished the amount of proteins of about  <dig> kda in the rosr mutant. in the supernatant of r. leguminosarum bv. viciae  <dig>  proteins of similar molecular masses  were identified.

moreover, extracellular proteins of the wild type and the rosr mutant differed depending on growth in complex  or minimal  media, similarly to proteins secreted by the r. leguminosarum bv. viciae  <dig> prsd mutant  <cit> .

r. leguminosarum bv. viciae  <dig>  an lps mutant  lacking the very long chain fatty acid  component of lipid a, displayed an increased sensitivity to membrane stressors and an increase in the secretion of neutral surface polysaccharides, namely, periplasmic cyclic β--glucans  <cit> . the production of these compounds is associated with hypo-osmotic stress tolerance in rhizobia  <cit> . the higher sensitivity of the rosr mutants to hypo-osmotic stress might be explained by increased permeability of their cell envelopes, which could allow excretion of greater amounts of neutral polysaccharides.

recently, several other osmotically unstable rhizobial mutants have been described, among them salt-sensitive mutants of s. meliloti, some of them significantly affected in competing against the wild type for nodule occupancy  <cit> . mutation in s. meliloti regulatory gene nesr affected competition for nodulation, adaptation to high osmolarity, and nutrient starvation  <cit> . also, genes encoding trehalose biosynthesis pathways and potassium uptake systems were found to be important for s. meliloti growth in hyperosmotic medium  <cit> .

r. leguminosarum bv. trifolii rosr mutants deficient in eps production grew considerably slower than the wild type on minimal medium. using the biolog system, we established that the rosr mutant revealed differences in utilization of carbon and nitrogen sources in relation to the wild type. similarly, phenotypic analysis of s. meliloti exos and chvi null mutants demonstrated that exos/chvi regulatory system not only controls succinoglycan  and galactoglucan  synthesis but is also required for growth on over  <dig> different carbon sources  <cit> . the chvi mutant exhibited several pleiotropic effects: failed to grow on complex medium, had an altered lps profile, exhibited lower tolerance to acidic conditions, was hypermotile, and synthesized significantly less poly-3-hydroxybutyrate than wild type, indicating that chvi is engaged in regulatory networks involving the cell envelope and metabolism  <cit> .

in several studies, a connection between the production of bacterial polysaccharides and motility has been established. both r. leguminosarum bv. trifolii rosr mutants and the pssa mutant deficient in eps production exhibited a significant decrease in motility. s. meliloti mucr protein that simultaneously acts as a transcriptional repressor of galactoglucan synthesis and an activator of succinoglycan synthesis  <cit>  inhibits the expression of rem encoding an activator of the expression of such genes as flaf and flgg  <cit> . other regulatory proteins, such as the expr/sin quorum system, are additionally engaged in the regulation of s. meliloti motility  <cit> . a non-motile phenotype has also been described for ndva and ndvb mutants defective in the synthesis of β--glucans under hypo-osmotic conditions  <cit> . alterations in the lps structure often cause motility-related defects  <cit> . the r. leguminosarum bv. viciae  <dig> lps mutant mentioned earlier was impaired in motility and biofilm formation. in this mutant, the motility genes flaa, mcpc, mcpd, visn, and rem were significantly down regulated when compared with the wild type  <cit> .

the r. leguminosarum bv. trifolii rosr mutants formed significantly reduced amounts of biofilm, which was altered in structure and maturation and contained more dead cells in comparison to the wild type. the rt <dig>  pssa mutant formed smaller amounts of biofilm in comparison to the rosr mutants, which confirms the important role of this polymer in biofilm development. similarly, r. leguminosarum bv. viciae pssa mutant was unable to develop microcolonies and more complex biofilm structures  <cit> . the presence of a rosr-box motif in the promoter region of r. leguminosarum bv. trifolii pssa and the significantly lower expression of pssa-lacz fusion in the rosr mutant than in the wild type indicate positive regulation of this gene by rosr  <cit> . in s. meliloti, the lmw fraction of eps ii was established to be crucial for formation of a biofilm with a highly ordered structure  <cit> . eps ii non-producing strains or those producing only the hmw fraction of this polysaccharide formed very low amounts of biofilm  <cit> . in the case of rt <dig> and rt <dig>  the amount of lmw eps was diminished, but the role of this fraction in biofilm formation remains to be elucidated. beside rhizobial surface components, such as eps and lps, and quorum sensing systems, several other environmental factors affect biofilm formation, among them catabolite repression and nutrient limitation  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we characterized rosr mutants bearing a mutation in the gene encoding a transcriptional regulator with a c2h <dig> type zinc-finger motif. we demonstrated the importance of the intact rosr gene both in the interaction with the host plant and in the bacterial adaptation to stress conditions. the pleiotropic effects of the rosr mutation confirmed the importance of this gene not only for exopolysaccharide production, but also for several other metabolic traits.
