BACKGROUND
the mammalian tachykinins are a group of peptides sharing the common c-terminal sequence phe-x-gly-leu-met-nh <dig>  the three principal tachykinins are substance p, neurokinin a and neurokinin b, and although these are preferred agonists for the neurokinin- <dig>  neurokinin- <dig> and neurokinin- <dig> receptors respectively, they are not completely selective for any one receptor subtype  <cit> . tachykinin receptors are distributed throughout the cns, with all three receptor subtypes being expressed in the adult rat hippocampus  <cit> . a dense network of fibres containing substance p innervates the stratum oriens, stratum radiatum and alveus of the rat hippocampus. these may arise from both extrinsic sources such as the septum and hypothalamus, and from intrinsic gaba-containing interneurones  <cit> .

although being widespread in the hippocampus, the role tachykinins play in normal synaptic transmission is unclear. using extracellular recordings from the mouse hippocampal slice, substance p and its analogue substance p methyl ester have been reported to cause a decrease in the amplitude and slope of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential  recorded from the ca <dig> stratum pyramidale  <cit> . the effect was blocked by the selective neurokinin- <dig> receptor antagonist sr <dig>  suggesting the action was nk- <dig> receptor mediated. the effect of substance p methyl ester was blocked by bicuculline, an antagonist for gabaa receptors, and not by glutamate receptor antagonists. the authors concluded the depressant effect of substance p and substance p methyl ester required an intact gabaergic system, with substance p causing facilitation of gabaergic neurotransmission, thereby increasing inhibitory synaptic transmission  <cit> .

the aim of this present study was to use extracellular field recordings to a) identify the effect of substance p on synaptic transmission in the ca <dig> region of the rat hippocampus, and b) to use selective pharmacological agonists and antagonists to determine which tachykinin receptors were involved.

RESULTS
substance p had no effect on fepsp's
fepsps were recorded from the ca <dig> region of the rat hippocampus using single pulse stimulation of the schaffer collateral commissural fibres at  <dig> s intervals. perfusion of  <dig> μm substance p for  <dig> min had no significant effect on the amplitude of the fepsp  and  <dig>  not significant) or the slope of the fepsp  and  <dig>  not significant).

contrary to previous experiments performed in the mouse hippocampus  <cit> ), we therefore found no effect of substance p on fepsps recorded in the rat hippocampus. existing immunohistochemical and electrophysiological data point to the fact that substance p receptors are found solely on inhibitory interneurones in the hippocampus  <cit> . in our recording conditions, gabaergic transmission plays a minimal role in determining the slope or amplitude of the fepsp. we therefore turned to recording synaptic responses in which gabaergic transmission clearly has an effect. synaptic stimulation of ca <dig> pyramidal neurones evokes a powerful feedback inhibition, which is mediated by gabaa receptors  <cit> . paired pulse stimulation can be used to evoke a second response during this phase inhibition and the extent of paired pulse depression can be used as an index of the strength of gabaergic transmission  <cit> . we therefore investigated next the action of substance p on paired pulse depression of population spikes.

substance p decreased paired pulse depression
there is some variability in the extent of paired pulse depression observed between individual slices. in general, those slices deemed healthy by the criterion of not showing a secondary population spike to a single stimulus, also show good paired pulse depression. overall, ie prior to any selection of slices, when pulses were delivered  <dig> ms apart, the mean amplitude of the second population spike  was  <dig> ± 11% of the amplitude of the first  . for the following experiments however, unless otherwise stated, only those slices in which ps <dig> was 70% or less of ps <dig> when using a  <dig> ms interpulse interval were used. slices were stimulated every  <dig> s with paired pulses delivered  <dig> ms apart. a control period of at least  <dig> min was established, in which both ps <dig> amplitude and extent of paired pulse depression were stable, and then substance p was applied. perfusion of  <dig> μm substance p for  <dig> minutes was found to cause an increase in the amplitude of ps <dig> while having no effect on ps <dig>  and  <dig>  n = 7). the mean amplitude of ps <dig> during the control period was  <dig> ± 9% of ps <dig>  and this increased to  <dig> ± 8% of ps <dig>  at the end of drug perfusion. this increase in ps <dig> was not accompanied by any significant effect on the amplitude of ps <dig>  which was  <dig> ± 8% of control at the end of drug perfusion . the peak effect of substance p on paired pulse depression was observed within  <dig> min of perfusion, and the effect was reversible towards control levels over 20– <dig> min.

in a different set of experiments, we next examined whether the effect of substance p was limited to those interpulse intervals that correspond with the time course of gabaergic feedback inhibition. using paired pulse stimulation at interpulse intervals of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> ms, the effect of  <dig> μm substance p perfused for  <dig> min was studied. the effect of substance p was evident only at the shorter interpulse intervals of 20– <dig> ms , n = 9). the greatest increase in amplitude of ps <dig> was observed at the  <dig> ms interpulse interval where the control amplitude of ps <dig> was  <dig> ± 12% of ps <dig>  but increased to  <dig> ± 12% of ps <dig> at the end of drug perfusion . substance p also caused a smaller but still significant increase in the amplitude of ps <dig> at the  <dig> ms interpulse interval  and the  <dig> ms interpulse interval . in contrast, substance p had no significant effect at the  <dig> ms interpulse interval . further to this, in the minority of slices which, even at short interpulse intervals showed no paired pulse depression, perfusion of  <dig> μm substance p had no effect on the amplitude of the first or second population spike .

effect of other tachykinin agonists on paired pulse depression
substance p is most potent at the neurokinin- <dig> receptor, however, it can also activate the other tachykinin receptors . establishing an order of potency of selective agonists in mimicking the effect of substance p is therefore a useful indicator of which receptor mediates the effect.

substance p methyl ester has been reported to be a potent neurokinin- <dig> receptor agonist  <cit> . using paired pulse stimulation with an interpulse interval of  <dig> ms, perfusion of  <dig>  μm substance p methyl ester for  <dig> min had no effect on ps <dig>  but significantly increased the amplitude of ps <dig>  though the effect appeared smaller than that produced by  <dig> μm substance p. substance p methyl ester produced an increase in ps <dig> amplitude from  <dig> ± 7% to  <dig> ± 10% of ps <dig> at the end of drug perfusion , while having no effect on ps <dig> .

-neurokinin a  is an neurokinin- <dig> receptor preferring agonist  <cit> . using paired pulse stimulation with an interpulse interval of  <dig> ms, perfusion of  <dig> μm -neurokinin a  for  <dig> min had a small and statistically insignificant effect on ps <dig>  ps <dig> amplitude increased from  <dig> ± 13% to  <dig> ± 13% of ps <dig> at the end of drug perfusion . it too had no effect on ps <dig> . in order to directly compare the effect of substance p in the same slices, after a 30-min washout,  <dig> μm substance p was perfused for  <dig> min. this increased the amplitude of ps <dig> from  <dig> ± 4% to  <dig> ± 30% of ps <dig> .

senktide is a neurokinin- <dig> receptor preferring agonist  <cit>  and was found to have no effect on the amplitude of ps <dig> or ps <dig>  using paired pulse stimulation with an interpulse interval of  <dig> ms,  <dig> μm senktide perfused for  <dig> min had no significant effect on the amplitude of ps <dig> . in the same slices, after a 30-min washout,  <dig> μm substance p was perfused for  <dig> min and it again increased ps <dig> amplitude from  <dig> ± 7% of ps <dig> to  <dig> ± 5% of ps <dig> at the end of drug perfusion .

effect of neurokinin- <dig>  neurokinin- <dig> and neurokinin- <dig> receptor antagonists on the action of substance p
to further characterise the receptor via which substance p decreased paired pulse depression, we next used three selective antagonists.

sr <dig>  a non-peptide neurokinin- <dig> preferring antagonist, was obtained from sanofi research  <cit> . to establish a within-slice control,  <dig> μm substance p was first perfused for  <dig> min and, using an interpulse interval of  <dig> ms, this again caused an increase in the amplitude of ps <dig>  as previously seen. after a 30-min washout period, during which ppd returned to control levels,  <dig> μm sr <dig> was perfused for  <dig> min prior to, and during, a second perfusion of substance p. sr <dig> had no effect on either ps <dig> or ps <dig> when perfused alone. however, when  <dig> μm substance p was perfused in the presence of sr <dig>  the effect of substance p on ps <dig> was reduced . substance p increased the amplitude of ps <dig> from  <dig> ± 8% of ps <dig> to  <dig> ± 19% of ps <dig>  and when applied in the presence of sr <dig> it increased ps <dig> from  <dig> ± 8% of ps <dig> to  <dig> ± 17% of ps <dig> .

mdl  <dig>  is a neurokinin- <dig> receptor antagonist  <cit> . using the same protocol as described above, the effect of  <dig> μm substance p was established and allowed to recover, before  <dig> μm mdl <dig>  was applied for  <dig> min prior to, and during, a second perfusion of substance p. mdl  <dig>  was found to have no effect itself on ps <dig> or ps <dig>  or to block the effect of substance p. substance p perfused for  <dig> min caused an increase in ps <dig> from a control amplitude of  <dig> ±  <dig> of ps <dig> to  <dig> ±  <dig> of ps <dig> at the end of drug perfusion. when applied in the presence of mdl  <dig> , substance p still increased the amplitude of ps <dig> to  <dig> ±  <dig> of ps <dig> .

-neurokinin a  is a neurokinin- <dig> receptor-preferring antagonist  <cit> . using the same protocol as described above,  <dig> μm -neurokinin a  was applied for  <dig> min prior to, and for  <dig> min during, application of substance p. -neurokinin a  was found to have no effect itself on ps <dig> or ps <dig>  or to block the effect of substance p. within slice controls showed that  <dig> μm substance p perfused for  <dig> min caused an increase in ps <dig> from a control value of  <dig> ± 13% of ps <dig> to  <dig> ± 3% of ps <dig> at the end of drug perfusion . when  <dig> μm substance p was perfused in the presence of  <dig> μm -neurokinin a , substance p increased the amplitude of ps <dig> to  <dig> ± 2% of ps <dig> 

discussion
substance p selectively decreases paired pulse depression
the most striking feature of our results is the selective effect of substance p on ps <dig>  but not ps <dig>  tachykinin receptors are located on inhibitory interneurones and not pyramidal cells  <cit>  and neurokinin- <dig> receptors in particular are located on the cell body and dendrites of gaba immunopositive interneurones  <cit> . the location of the neurokinin- <dig> receptors would suggest an involvement of substance p in the control of inhibition of pyramidal neurones, and maybe of other interneurones, but not in directly modulating excitatory transmission. this is consistent with the fact that substance p had no effect on the recorded fepsp or on ps <dig>  which are primarily mediated by ampa receptors. this result is, however, in disagreement with previous work. kouznetsova and nistri  <cit>  found that perfusion of substance p  and its synthetic analogue, substance p methyl-ester, significantly depressed field potentials recorded from the ca <dig> region of the mouse hippocampus. the reason for this discrepancy may be due to species difference , or alternatively to the baseline recording conditions, and specifically the level of gabaergic inhibition. kouznetsova and nistri  <cit>  hypothesised that substance p exerted its depressant action via gaba interneurones and not directly on the pyramidal cells recorded from. in our experiments, we deliberately selected hippocampal slices that exhibited good paired pulse depression, and therefore robust gabaergic inhibition. if this inhibition was effectively maximal, then substance p may be unable to further enhance it. it is therefore significant that we have previously noted paired pulse depression  is much weaker in slices maintained in a submersion chamber of the type used by kouznetsova and nistri, than an interface chamber as used in our experiments.

since we could not demonstrate any effect of substance p on synaptic responses to single pulse stimulation, we turned to the phenomenon of paired pulse depression. using an interstimulus interval of  <dig> ms, substance p  perfused onto slices that displayed paired pulse depression, increased the amplitude of ps <dig> with no effect on ps <dig>  paired pulse depression of population spikes is thought to be predominately caused by feedback inhibition and can be used as an index of the strength of gabaergic neurotransmission within the hippocampus  <cit> . as previously noted, neurokinin- <dig> receptors are located on interneurones of the hippocampus, and substance p acting at these receptors could regulate the release of gaba. a decrease in gaba release would decrease the amplitude of the gabaergic ipsp evoked in the pyramidal neurone, increasing the probability that a second stimulus would fire an action potential, thereby increasing ps <dig> and inhibiting paired pulse depression. this effect was found to occur only at shorter interstimlus intervals of below  <dig> ms, which corresponds with the time course of the intracellularly recorded gabaa receptor mediated ipsp evoked in the ca <dig> pyramidal neurones  <cit> . an effect on inhibitory synaptic transmission is supported by the anatomical localisation of substance p receptors to gaba-containing interneurones and not to glutamate containing principal  cells  <cit> . furthermore, electrophysiological recordings show that neurokinin- <dig> receptor agonists depolarise interneurones and increase the frequency of spontaneous  inhibitory post synaptic currents  recorded from pyramidal cells in the ca <dig> region of the hippocampus  <cit> . whilst these experiments showed an increase, rather than a decrease in the frequency of spontaneous ipscs, they did not investigate the effect of substance p on evoked ipscs.

effects of selective tachykinin receptor agonists and antagonists
a range of selective tachykinin receptor agonists was investigated. the neurokinin- <dig> receptor agonist substance p methyl ester was selected because it had been previously found to effectively mimic the effects of substance p in the mouse hippocampus, where it was effective in a concentration range of  <dig> nm– <dig> μm, with the maximum depressant action on field potentials observed using  <dig>  μm  <cit> . in our experiments, perfusion of substance p methyl ester , mimicked the effect of substance p and caused a significant increase in the amplitude of ps <dig>  due to the different concentrations used , it is not possible to comment on the relative potencies of substance p and substance p methyl ester in our experiments. -neurokinin a  has been found to be a highly selective neurokinin- <dig> receptor agonist which has a 100-fold higher potency for neurokinin- <dig> receptors than for neurokinin- <dig> receptors  <cit> .  <dig> μm -neurokinin a  had a small effect on the amplitude of ps <dig> although this was not statistically significant. any effect of -neurokinin a  on ps <dig> may be mediated via neurokinin- <dig> receptors, or more plausibly, -neurokinin a  may have some effect on neurokinin- <dig> receptors  <cit> . such a weak interaction of neurokinin- <dig> receptor agonists with neurokinin- <dig> receptors has been reported in the entorhinal cortex, where -neurokinin a  mimicked the action of substance p in increasing gaba release from interneurones; an effect which was blocked by a neurokinin- <dig> receptor antagonist  <cit> . the neurokinin- <dig> receptor agonist senktide is one of the most potent of the neurokinin- <dig> receptor agonists  <cit> . perfusion of  <dig> μm senktide had no effect on the amplitude of ps <dig>  suggesting that the neurokinin- <dig> receptor is not involved in the decrease observed in paired pulse depression and has no effect on synaptic transmission measured here. a comparison of the effects of the agonists used gives an order of potency of substance p > -neurokinin a  > senktide. this is consistent with the effect of substance p on paired pulse depression being mediated by the neurokinin- <dig> receptor.

to further characterise the receptor involved, three tachykinin antagonist were used in an attempt to block the action of substance p. the selective neurokinin- <dig> receptor antagonist sr <dig>  significantly blocked the effect of substance p, although not completely. in the guinea pig ileum it was found that for sr <dig> to have its full activity, a long contact time with the tissue was required  <cit>  and this has been suggested to be longer than  <dig> min  <cit> . contact time in the experiments performed here was a total of  <dig> min so an even better block may have been achieved with a longer perfusion time. nevertheless, the ability of sr <dig> to reduce the effect of substance p on paired pulse depression is consistent with the effect being neurokinin- <dig> receptor mediated. this is further supported with complete lack of effect of the neurokinin- <dig> receptor antagonist mdl <dig> , and the neurokinin- <dig> receptor antagonist -neurokinin a . an internal control was used in these experiments, which involved substance being applied twice to the same slice, firstly in the absence, and then in the presence of the antagonist. under these conditions, desensitization of receptors might be expected to result in a smaller second response, independent of any antagonist effects. however, the fact that repeated perfusion of substance in the presence of the nk <dig> and nk <dig> antagonists produced substantially the same effect suggest that this is not the case, and that the reduced effect of substance p in the presence of sr <dig> is due to antagonism of neurokinin- <dig> receptors.

the resulting order of potency of the agonists, and the effectiveness of the antagonists, therefore both suggest that the effect of substance p on paired pulse depression is mediated by neurokinin- <dig> receptors.

future work
whilst the results of our experiments are consistent with the action of substance p being mediated by neurokinin- <dig> receptors, a more definitive proof of this would be to perform similar experiments in neurokinin- <dig> receptor knockout mice to establish whether substance p still inhibits paired pulse depression in these animals. there is some evidence that central tachykinin receptors may have different properties to the better characterised peripheral tachykinin receptors, and the possibility remains that the central effects of substance p are mediated by a distinct gene product, albeit with similar properties.

the effect of substance p in selectively decreasing paired pulse depression is consistent with a decrease in gabaergic inhibitory feedback inhibition of ca <dig> pyramidal cells, and such a mechanism is supported by the anatomical localisation of neurokinin- <dig> receptors in the hippocampus. however, other factors also contribute to paired pulse depression  <cit>  and therefore, to investigate this hypothesis further, future experiments should use intracellular or whole-cell patch recordings from both pyramidal cells, and from interneurones in the ca <dig> region. whilst there is convincing evidence that substance p inhibits spontaneous gaba release from interneurones  <cit> , the effect of substance p on evoked ipsps has not been determined. such experiments will give further insights into the role of substance p in the central nervous system.

CONCLUSIONS
the results show that perfusion substance p causes a selective reduction in paired pulse inhibition of population spikes evoked in the ca <dig> region of the rat hippocampal slice, and that this effect is mediated by nk <dig> receptors. this is consistent with the notion that nk <dig> receptors are present on the terminals of inhibitory interneurones and act to regulate gaba release.
