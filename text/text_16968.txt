BACKGROUND
flavonoids are plant secondary metabolites. they have a wide range of functions such as  providing pigmentation to flowers, fruits, and seeds in order to attract pollinators and seed dispersers,  protecting against ultraviolet light,  providing defence against phytopathogens ,  playing a role in plant fertility and germination of pollen and  acting as signal molecules in plant-microbe interactions  <cit> . flavonoids receive a lot of attention due to their possible effects on human health. many flavonoids display antioxidant activity that confers beneficial effects on coronary heart disease, cancer, and allergies  <cit> . reports also suggest that some of the biological effects of anthocyanins and flavonols may be related to their ability to modulate mammalian cell signalling pathways  <cit> . enhancing the production of flavonoids in crop plants can therefore give an important boost to their nutritional value, which makes knowledge of expression and regulation of the flavonoid pathway important. flavonoids constitute a relatively diverse family of aromatic molecules that are derived from phenylalanine and malonyl-coenzyme a. most of the bright red and blue colours found in higher plants are due to anthocyanins. anthocyanin biosynthesis has been studied extensively in several plant species and detailed information on the pathway is available  <cit> . information on substrate flow and regulation through the branch point between flavonol and anthocyanin synthesis is however not fully elucidated, and for tomato the enzymes acting in the branch point have not been extensively characterised. experiments with expression of the snapdragon transcription factor genes delila, a basic-helix-loop-helix  transcription factor, and rosea <dig>  a r2r <dig> myb-type transcription factor, showed that f3'5'h expression is necessary for activation of anthocyanin synthesis in tomatoes  <cit> . introduction of these transcription factors under control of the fruit-specific e <dig> promoter increased the expression of most of the structural genes in the biosynthetic pathway in the tomato fruit, including phenylalanine ammonia-lyase , chalcone isomerase  and f3'5'h. pal insures high flux into the phenylpropanoid pathway, whereas chi and f3'5'h are essential for addressing the flux towards flavonoids in general and anthocyanin production specifically. the activity of chi is normally low in the tomato skin, leading to accumulation of naringenin-chalcone in the skin of wild type tomatoes  <cit> . the cytochrome p <dig> dependent flavonoid hydroxylases introduce either one  or two  of the hydroxyl groups on the b ring of the flavonoid skeleton  <cit> . the f3'5'h belongs to the cyp <dig> superfamily of p <dig> enzymes  <cit> . these enzymes are anchored to the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum via their hydrophobic n- terminal end. only plants that express the f3'5'h gene are capable of producing blue flowers, as these are dependent on 5'-hydroxylated anthocyanins. f3'5'-hydroxylases are previously known from other plants, such as petunia hybrida , catharanthus roseus , vitis vinifera , campanula medium , solanum tuberosum  and solanum melongena , among others. to be active p <dig> enzymes need to be coupled to an electron donor. this can either be a cytochrome p <dig> reductase or cytochrome b <dig>  the reductase will also be anchored to the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum via its n- or c-terminus  <cit> . kaltenbach et al.  <cit>  isolated the f3'5'h gene from c. roseus using heterologous screening with the cyp <dig> hf <dig> cdna from p. hybrida  <cit> . both the c. roseus gene, named cyp75a <dig>  and the petunia hf <dig> were expressed in e. coli and found to accept flavones, flavanones, dihydroflavonols and flavonols as substrates, and both performed 3'- and 3'5'-hydroxylation. the genes encoding f3'5'h in grape have been shown to be expressed in different parts of the grape plant that accumulate flavonoids, especially in the skin of ripening berries where the highest levels of anthocyanins are synthesized  <cit> .

several genes in the flavonoid pathway display differences in substrate specificity or preference in various plant species. petunia dihydroflavonol 4-reductase , for instance, does not utilize dihydrokaempferol  <cit> . arabidopsis dfr converts dihydroquercetin into leuco-cyanidin, but will use dihydrokaempferol when dihydroquercetin is not available, e.g. in plants lacing functional f3'h enzyme  <cit> . this is because the plants lacking f3'h activity cannot produce dihydroquercetin . so far there is not much information on f3'5'h substrate specificity. available data  <cit>  generally confirm the same substrates, without reporting negative results for other substrates tested. however, tanaka et al.  <cit>  reported that the petunia hf <dig> cdna expressed in a yeast system did not accept apigenin as substrate. kaltenbach et al. did, however, show that the petunia hf <dig> can accept apigenin as substrate, when expressed in an e. coli system  <cit> .

f3'5'h competes with flavonol synthase  for the substrates dihydrokaempferol and dihydroquercetin . the preferred substrate for dfr in the tomato plant is dihydromyricetin  <cit> , which can be produced from dihydrokaempferol and dihydroquercetin by f3'5'h. this is the first step in the branch leading to anthocyanins , which are normally only found in the vegetative tissues of tomato. according to bovy et al.  <cit>  tomato fls prefers dihydroquercetin and dihydrokaempferol as substrates, and does not use dihydromyricetin, hence dfr and fls do not compete for the same substrate. nevertheless fls can still deplete the flow of substrate towards dfr by using dihydrokaempferol and dihydroquercetin as they precede dihydromyricetin in the synthesis pathway. f3'h might also compete with fls and f3'5'h for dihydrokaempferol, although it is unclear, as the enzyme has not been characterised from tomato so far. the activities of fls, f3'5'h, dfr, and possibly f3'h, hence regulate the distribution between flavonols and anthocyanins in tomato plants. as a consequence, f3'5'h can be a bottleneck in this system as dfr relies on its activity to proceed the synthesis towards anthocyanins. bovy et al.  <cit>  has shown that silencing of the fls gene leads to more anthocyanins in vegetative tomato tissue. introduction of an fls rnai construct into tomato plants led to decreased levels of quercetin-3-rutinoside  in tomato peel, and to accumulation of anthocyanins in leaves, stems and flower buds. this indicates that less competition from flavonol synthesis will enhance the flux towards anthocyanins by allowing more substrate for dfr. in this study we cloned, sequenced and characterised the f3'5'h enzyme, which produces substrate for dfr in tomato. accumulation of flavonoids, and distribution of products through the different branches of the flavonoid pathway, has previously been shown to be influenced by nitrogen supply  <cit> . an agricultural plant like tomato is typically given nitrogen through fertilization; hence the level of nitrogen available to the plant can be monitored. it is, therefore, important to elucidate the effects nitrogen has on expression of genes and accumulation of compounds, such as flavonoids. extensive knowledge on the branch-point enzyme f3'5'h is crucial for understanding the distribution of flow through the flavonoid pathway, potentially enabling manipulation of desired end-product accumulation in fruits and vegetables in response to growth conditions.

RESULTS
sequence analysis
the cyp75a <dig> gene was isolated using sequence homology with a potato f3'5'h and 3' race to identify the 3' end of the gene. a tomato est sequence found in the tigr database was assumed to be the 5' end of the gene , and primers based on these sequences led to isolation of the cdna and dna sequences for cyp75a <dig>  the  <dig> bp gene sequence  consists of three exons , which is consistent with what is previously reported for potato, petunia and soybean  <cit> . a blast search  performed with the coding sequence revealed 94% identity to a s. tuberosum, 88% identity to a s. melongena and 84% identity to a p. hybrida f3'5'h sequence.

phylogenetic analysis
the phylogenetic tree  was made using protein sequences from several plant f3'5'h enzymes retrieved from the ncbi web page. the tree clearly visualises that cyp75a <dig> is most closely related to the f3'5'h enzymes of the solanum species potato and eggplant.

cyp75a <dig> substrate specificity
the coding sequence of the cyp75a <dig> gene was transformed into yeast for heterologous expression. enzyme assays were run on isolated microsome fractions, substrates and products were analysed by hplc and ms. the substrates found to be metabolized by cyp75a <dig> are listed in table  <dig>  luteolin  gave tricetin  as the only product. naringenin  gave rice to two peaks in the hplc-spectrum identified as eriodictyol , and  <dig> ,3',4',5'-pentahydroxyflavanone. as expected, eriodictyol as substrate gave only one product,  <dig> ,3',4',5'-pentahydroxyflavanone. dihydrokaempferol  gave two peaks, dihydroquercetin , and dihydromyricetin . dihydroquercetin as substrate gave one product, as expected, identified as dihydromyricetin. kaempferol  resulted in two peaks, identified as quercetin  and myricetin . quercetin as substrate gave myricetin as the only product, and liquiritigenin  gave two products: butin  and  <dig> ',4',5'-tetrahydroxyflavanone. neither the control reactions without nadph, nor assays with microsomes isolated from yeast transformed with pyedp <dig> vector lacking an insertion, showed any product formation.

gene expression
tomato plants were grown on rock-wool with complete nutrient supply under continuous light. the rock-wool was rinsed with water to remove previous nutrient solution, and plants were randomly divided in two batches. one batch continued with complete nutrient solution, whereas the second batch received nutrient solution with no nitrogen. samples were harvested before change of nutrients  and again after three days. gene expression was measured by real-time pcr, using the shoot top  on day  <dig> as calibrator. relative expression of all genes is hence given as a fold change related to the shoot top sample taken on day  <dig>  expression of the f3'5'h gene, six other structural genes of the phenylpropanoid pathway and transcription factors anthocyanin  <dig>  and sljaf <dig>  was tested by real-time pcr. all nine genes showed a general increase in response to nitrogen deprivation . averaged over all parts of the plant the expression of chalcone synthase  <dig> , f3'h, pal <dig>  fls, f3'5'h, dfr, sljaf <dig> and ant <dig> on day  <dig> was  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold higher, respectively, in nitrogen deprived plants as compared to plants given full nutrient solution. at day  <dig>  flavanone 3-hydroxylase   showed detectable expression only for nitrogen deprived plants, which overall was  <dig> fold higher than on day  <dig>  f3h is the only gene with no detectable transcripts in plants receiving nitrogen on day 3; the reason for this is unknown. all of the genes, with the exception of f3'h , showed highest expression in nitrogen depleted leaflets  on day  <dig>  for f3'h the highest expression was found in nitrogen depleted petioles . the nitrogen effect in leaflets was especially high for f3'5'h . pal <dig>  showed a clear increase in response to nitrogen deprivation, also in roots. sljaff <dig>  showed a clear nitrogen effect in all plant parts tested, as did ant <dig> . expression of chs <dig>  displayed a convincing nitrogen effect in shoot top, petiole, leaflets and stalk . dfr  was expressed in much the same way as chs <dig> but showed a slightly higher increase in relative expression in the leaflets, and lower in the shoot top of nitrogen deprived plants. expression of fls  was clearly elevated in all parts of nitrogen deprived plants while the level remained relatively stable in plants receiving nitrogen.

phenolic content
measurements of phenolic content were conducted on the same samples as the expression analysis. rutin was detected in all samples, except roots at day  <dig>  in all parts of the plant the content had increased from day  <dig> to day  <dig> and was clearly higher in nitrogen deprived plants . the overall content of rutin in nitrogen deprived plants on day  <dig> was  <dig>  times higher than in nitrogen replete plants. kaempferol-3-rutinoside was not detected in samples from stalk or root, and only in nitrogen deprived leaflets. in the shoot top and petiole there was a clear increase from day  <dig> to day  <dig>  especially in nitrogen depleted plants . the overall content of kaempferol-3-rutinoside in nitrogen deprived plants on day  <dig> was  <dig>  times higher than in nitrogen replete plants. anthocyanins were not detectable in any samples under the growth conditions used.

discussion
when starting the in vitro enzyme assays, substrates were chosen based on previous findings on accepted substrates for f3'5'h enzymes from other plants. substrates were also chosen based on structural similarity to these compounds. with the exception of liquiritigenin, substrates found to be metabolized by cyp75a <dig> were also found to be metabolized by cyp75a <dig>  which was previously isolated from c. roseus  <cit> . the kaltenbach group also tested a petunia f3'5'h in the e. coli expression system used for cyp75a <dig>  and found that the petunia f3'5'h accepted the same substrates. whereas the c. roseus f3'5'h had highest activity with apigenin, the petunia f3'5'h had highest activity with naringenin  <cit> . for the cyp75a <dig> enzyme there was a clear preference for naringenin and liquiritigenin, as these substrates were metabolised also in dilute microsome preparations. in the present study, cyp75a <dig> was also expressed in the same yeast  system as cyp75a <dig>  km for naringenin was measured to  <dig>  μm for cyp75a <dig>  and  <dig>  μm for cyp75a <dig>  kaltenbach et al.  <cit>  reported an apparent km of  <dig> μm for naringenin when expressing cyp75a <dig> in the e. coli expression system. the rate of hydroxylation performed by a f3'5'h enzyme is dependent on the reductase used in the expression system. de vetten et al.  <cit>  has shown that a cytochrome b <dig> is required for full activity of f3'5'h in petunia. the gene encoding a cytochrome b <dig> was inactivated by targeted transposon mutagenesis, which resulted in reduced f3'5'h activity and reduced accumulation of 5'-substituted anthocyanins, leading to an alteration in flower colour. our expression studies utilized the arabidopsis atr <dig> reductase, whereas in the expression studies performed by kaltenbach et al.  <cit> , a c. roseus p <dig> reductase was used in the e. coli expression system. the use of different expression systems, and reductases, may explain the difference in km values obtained for the c. roseus cyp75a <dig> enzyme in the two studies  <cit> .

liquiritigenin has to our knowledge not been shown to be metabolized by a f3'5'h enzyme previously. liquiritigenin in plants is mostly associated with the legumes, which have a chi capable of isomerising 6'-hydroxy- and 6'-deoxychalcones to 5-hydroxy- and 5-deoxyflavanones respectively. joung et al.  <cit>  reported that the tobacco chi is able to isomerise the 6'-deoxychalcone isoliquiritigenin to the 5-deoxyflavanone, liquiritigenin, in transgenic tobacco over-expressing a pueraria montana chalcone reductase gene. tanaka et al.  <cit>  showed that the f3'5'h from gentiana triflora catalysed the hydroxylation of naringenin to eriodictyol, eriodictyol to  <dig>   <dig>  3', 4', 5'-pentahydroxyflavanone, dihydrokaempferol to dihydroquercetin, dihydroquercetin to dihydromyricetin and apigenin to luteolin when expressed in s. cerevisiae under the control of a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter. the reaction rates and substrate preferences recorded in bacteria or yeast expression systems do not necessarily represent the actual rate or preference in planta. as demonstrated in this study, the tomato f3'5'h is capable of metabolizing liquiritigenin, although to our knowledge liquiritigenin has never been found in tomato plants.

expression analysis showed that all the major genes of the flavonoid pathway tested, including f3'5'h, had a clear increase in expression as a result of three days of nitrogen deprivation . despite what seemed to be a general up-regulation of the flavonoid pathway in this study, the growth conditions applied had not resulted in accumulation of anthocyanins at the time of sampling. at the time of sampling, the increase in gene expression was more prominent than the increase in level of rutin and kaempferol-3-rutinoside. as gene expression increases prior to accumulation of product this implies that accumulation of rutin and kaempferol-3-rutinoside had not yet reached the maximum. similar studies  conducted on nitrogen deprived tomato plants have shown that also anthocyanins will appear over time. possibly the concentrations of dihydrokaempferol and/or dihydroquercetin have to exceed a threshold level for f3'5'h to metabolise what fls does not have capacity for. similar studies  <cit>  showed far higher levels of flavonol-derivatives than in the present study at the time of anthocyanin accumulation, which might indicate that fls does not have the capacity to metabolise all the dihydrokaempferol/dihydroquercetin as the flow through the pathway escalates. the increase in transcripts of f3'h in all parts of the nitrogen deprived plants, indicates increased production of the f3'h enzyme, which hydroxylates dihydrokaempferol to dihydroquercetin. the action of this enzyme, , might explain why the content of rutin is much higher than kaempferol-3-rutinoside, since they have dihydroquercetin and dihydrokaempferol as precursors respectively. it should be mentioned that although the f3'h tested here was a clear orthologue to the petunia f3'h, the tomato f3'h has not yet been cloned and characterised, hence its function still needs to be established. this is especially relevant considering that the f3'5'h present in tomato is also capable of catalysing the 3'-hydroxylation.

a similar study  <cit>  showed accumulation of anthocyanins in leaves of nitrogen deprived tomato plants. in this study the nitrogen deprivation lasted a minimum of four days, and flavonoid content continued to increase from the fourth to the eighth day of nitrogen deprivation.

consistent with the increase in rutin and kaempferol-3-rutinoside, the enzyme responsible for increasing flux into the phenylpropanoid pathway, pal <dig> increased in expression as a response to nitrogen deprivation. the myb-type transcription factor ant <dig>  and the putative bhlh transcription factor sljaf <dig>  also increased in all parts of nitrogen deprived plants. this is consistent with the general increase in all the flavonoid structural genes tested, and the increase in flavonoid content.

CONCLUSIONS
the sequenced gene, cyp75a <dig>  encodes a flavonoid 3'5'-hydroxylase which accepts luteolin, naringenin, eriodictyol, dihydrokaempferol, dihydroquercetin, kaempferol, quercetin and liquiritigenin as substrates. the ability to do 3'- and especially 5'-hydroxylation of intermediates in the flavonoid pathway places cyp75a <dig> at an important branch point in the regulation between flavonol and anthocyanin synthesis. expression of the cyp75a <dig> gene increased in response to nitrogen deprivation, in accordance with other genes in the phenylpropanoid pathway, which is an expected response to abiotic stress in plants.
