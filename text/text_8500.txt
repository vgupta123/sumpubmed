BACKGROUND
streptococcus pneumoniae is a gram positive diplococcus that colonizes the upper respiratory tract in about 20% of healthy humans, but is a leading cause of diseases such as otitis media, bacteremia, lobar pneumonia, and meningitis  <cit> , particularly when enclosed in type-specific polysaccharide capsules. among the elderly, s. pneumoniae is the most common cause of fatal community-acquired pneumonia  <cit> , and in children the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia, middle ear infections and meningitis  <cit> . from  <dig> to  <dig>  resistance to s. pneumoniae has increased significantly, presumably due to the increased use of antibiotics. the first reports of penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae strains appeared in the us in the early-1980s  <cit> , then beginning in the 1990s their share increased from less than 5% of all isolates to approximately 35% in  <dig>  <cit> . similarly, resistance to macrolides is increasing, with 24% of all isolates being resistant in  <dig>  <cit> . to further complicate the issue, multidrug resistance is increasingly present among s. pneumoniae isolates, documented by a recent study showing  <dig> % of all isolates to be resistant to at least three antibiotics  <cit> .

in light of this growing resistance problem, the identification and characterization of more potential targets for antibiotic therapy is of paramount importance. the inhibition of bacterial growth through antibiotics targeting cell wall biosynthesis has been a proven mode of action since the beginning of the antibiotic era  <cit> . while penicillin targets the crosslinking reaction in peptidoglycan biosynthesis, there are also choices when it comes to inhibiting the formation of essential precursors for the peptidoglycan layer. one of those precursors, the amino acid d-alanine, is an essential component of the tetrapeptide crosslinking the glycan strands. it is provided through the racemization of the naturally occurring l-alanine, catalyzed by the cytoplasmic enzyme alanine racemase .

alr is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate containing enzyme, ubiquitous among most bacteria, and absent in humans. a lysine residue connected to the plp cofactor by an internal aldimine bond acts as a base for the conversion of d-to l-alanine while a nearby tyrosine from the second monomer acts as a base for the abstraction of a hydrogen from l-alanine  <cit> . we have determined crystal structures of alanine racemases from other human pathogens in the past. notably, the enzymes from mycobacterium tuberculosis and pseudomonas aeruginosa have been resolved at high resolution  <cit> . both enzymes are dimers with a similar domain makeup and include both an α/β-barrel at the n-terminus and a c-terminus primarily made of β-strands. because the active site of alr is small we are interested in identifying conserved residues that regulate the entrance of the substrate into the substrate binding pocket  <cit>  with the goal of developing compounds to control access of substrate to the active site.

this paper describes the molecular cloning, expression, purification, and elucidation of the biochemical properties of the alanine racemase from s. pneumoniae. we show evidence that the alrsp gene encodes a functional alanine racemase through complementation of an e. coli d-alanine auxotroph, and through a specific spectrophotometric assay. we have obtained preliminary crystals of s. pneumoniae alr, and intend to incorporate the enzyme into our ongoing structure-based drug design program  <cit> . determining the structure of alrsp is an essential prerequisite for the development of an accurate pharmacophore model of the enzyme. using our structure will allow us to conduct molecular dynamics simulations to obtain information about the different conformations of the enzyme , eventually yielding a dynamic pharmacophore model. using in silico methods, compounds from the available chemicals directory  <cit>  that fit the pharmacophore model will be identified and submitted to experimental testing, first in vitro and subsequently in vivo. proof of principle has been provided by our collaborators at the university of houston for the alanine racemase from g. stearothermophilus  <cit> .

RESULTS
amplification and cloning of the s. pneumoniae alr gene
the putative open reading frame for the alanine racemase from s. pneumoniae was identified through sequence comparison between known alanine racemase sequences and the s. pneumoniae sequences deposited in genbank. there was only one unambiguous hit in the database , suggesting that s. pneumoniae, unlike e. coli or p. aeruginosa, contains only one alanine racemase. the second alanine racemase  when present is commonly part of an operon. the s. pneumoniae genome carries only this single gene, not apparently in an operon, and thus is lacking the l-alanine inducible catabolic dadx alanine racemase. using primers homologous to the 5' and 3' end of the putative alrsp an  <dig> bp fragment was amplified and subsequently sequenced. the orf encodes a polypeptide of  <dig> amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of  <dig> daltons. using the restriction sites incorporated into the pcr primers the gene was ligated into the expression vector gene pet <dig> and cloned in e. coli mb <dig> 

sequence analysis of alr
comparison and analysis of the protein sequence encoded by alrsp from strain r <dig> revealed full identity with the protein sequences from strains r <dig>  and tigr <dig> . moreover, it displayed a high level of similarity with other alanine racemases , and carried the expected motifs such as the characteristic pyridoxal phosphate binding site  near the n-terminus, and the two catalytic amino acid residues  of the active center  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis  revealed no surprises; the enzyme is clustered with other streptococci species, such as s. mutans or s. pyogenes. these sequences, together with other alanine racemases from gram-positive bacteria appear to occupy one half of the phylogenetic tree, while the gram-negative bacteria occupy the other half.

since both alanine racemase and certain human enzymes, such as serine racemase  <cit>  depend on pyridoxal-5'phosphate  as their co-factor, it is important that antibiotic design efforts aim to develop inhibitors that are specific for the bacterial enzyme. however, it is worth noting that, in the case of serine racemase and alrsp both enzymes are indeed significantly distinct. the two racemases are only 13% identical on the amino acid level, so while they both may still be inhibited by the same small molecule, there is significant diversity between the enzymes, making it more likely that a potential inhibitor will actually be alanine racemase specific. in addition, our drug design efforts extend well beyond the plp binding site of the enzyme. as shown in our previous publication  <cit> , alanine racemases are characterized by a geometrically distinct entryway to the active site that is made up of eight highly conserved amino acid residues. this entryway is fully conserved in the alrsp sequence; residues y <dig>  y <dig>  y <dig> and a <dig> form the inner layer, while residues r <dig>  i <dig>  r <dig> and a <dig> constitute the middle layer. sequence analysis of the human serine racemase fails to identify those conserved residues. we thus hypothesize that an inhibitor designed to block the entryway would specifically inhibit the bacterial target, alanine racemase, and be much less likely to cross-react with eukaryotic plp-containing enzymes.

complementation analysis
in vivo demonstration that the gene product expressed alanine racemase activity was shown by complementation. the d-alanine auxotrophic e. coli strain mb <dig> was transformed with pet17-alrsp. a plasmid encoding the cloned p. aeruginosa dadx alanine racemase, pmb <dig> was used as a positive control. pet <dig> without insert served as a negative control. cells were plated on lb medium with and without d-alanine supplementation, and scored for colony growth after  <dig> h at 37°c. the alanine racemase gene from s. pneumoniae fully restored the wild-type phenotype, as did the p. aeruginosa dadx plasmid. cells transformed with pet <dig> failed to grow. thus the cloned s. pneumoniae gene encodes a functional alanine racemase.

overexpression, purification and biochemical characterization
the recombinant pet17-alrsp plasmid was transformed into e. coli bl <dig>  plyss, and expressed upon induction of t <dig> polymerase. the enzyme was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity as summarized in table  <dig>  purified enzyme was obtained in an overall yield of  <dig> % and exhibited a  <dig>  fold increase in specific activity over the crude lysate. the molecular mass of the purified protein, estimated by sds-page analysis, was approximately  <dig> kda, in line with the calculated value for the alrsp open reading frame . the kinetic properties of the purified s. pneumoniae enzyme are similar to other alanine racemases, it has a km for d-alanine at 23°c of  <dig>  mm and for l-alanine of  <dig>  mm. the vmax for the racemization  is  <dig>  and  <dig>  u mg- <dig>  respectively, where one unit was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed racemization of  <dig> μmol of substrate per minute. these values were used to calculate a keq of  <dig>  for this reaction, thus fulfilling the criterion  for a chemically symmetric reaction  <cit> .

some recent data suggested that alanine racemases are either monomeric or dimeric  <cit> . initially, molecular sieve chromatography was used to answer this question for alrsp. the molecular weight of five protein standards was plotted versus the ratio of their elution volume to the void volume of the column to yield a linear calibration curve. this curve was then used to determine an apparent molecular weight of  <dig> daltons for alrsp, a value suggesting a dimeric state for the enzyme. in order to further classify alrsp we additionally performed dynamic light scattering using the superdex purified enzyme. when tested at  <dig>  mg/ml we observed a single peak with a hydrodynamic radius of  <dig>  nm and a monodisperse profile. this radius corresponds to a molecular weight of  <dig> daltons, clearly suggesting that in solution the dominant form of alrsp is the dimer. even at lower concentrations of protein, we were not able to see any evidence for alrsp monomers, nor did we observe any mixed populations of monomers and dimers in the same preparation. as a result we conclude that this enzyme belongs to the majority of alanine racemases that form dimers, as do the enzymes from m. tuberculosis  <cit>  and p. aeruginosa  <cit> .

preliminary crystallization
preliminary crystals for alrsp were obtained using a sparse matrix crystallization approach  <cit> . initial crystals were obtained in  <dig>  m nacitrate,  <dig>  m hepes, ph <dig> . this condition was successively modified and better crystals of  <dig>  ×  <dig>  ×  <dig>  mm were eventually obtained in  <dig>  m nacitrate,  <dig>  m mes, ph <dig> , 10% glycerol . data analysis using x-ray crystallography is underway.

CONCLUSIONS
we have isolated the gene encoding alanine racemase from s. pneumoniae and obtained high level heterologous expression in e. coli as a dimer of  <dig> kda. sequence homology, complementation of a d-alanine auxotroph, and a specific spectrophotometric enzyme assay confirm the identity of the cloned protein. with the recent acquisition of protein crystals described here, and the homology with other known alanine racemases whose structures are available, we anticipate the structure of this enzyme should soon be available, allowing it to be integrated into our ongoing structure-based drug design project.
