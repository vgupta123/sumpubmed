BACKGROUND
in eukaryotic cells after translocation to the endoplasmic reticulum , the folding of secreted proteins is supported and controlled by chaperones, glycosylation enzymes and oxidoreductases. the correctly folded proteins are transported to the golgi compartment where further modification of the proteins takes place and the proteins are thereafter secreted out of the cell. accumulation of unfolded, misfolded or otherwise inefficiently secreted proteins or other impairing of secretion can cause stress to cells, i.e. secretion stress. secretion stress can be induced by heterologous proteins, leading to reduced yields of proteins or by exposure of cells to various chemicals that inhibit protein folding or transport and induce strong, clearly measurable responses.

eukaryotic cells respond in various ways to secretion stress. the best known response is the unfolded protein response  which is thought to modify and enhance the activity of the secretion pathway. in fungi, it is defined mainly through its transcriptional effects that are controlled by the sensor ire1p and the downstream transcription factor hac1p, as first described in s. cerevisiae. ire1p splices hac <dig> mrna and only then hac1p is actively translated and capable of activating its downstream genes  <cit> . the induction of almost  <dig> genes has been shown to depend on the ire <dig> and hac <dig> pathway  <cit> . recently it has been shown that the transcription factor gcn4p is also required for induction of majority of these genes  <cit> .

the response to secretion stress in t. reesei has previously been shown to share several features in common with s. cerevisiae. components of the upr pathway have been isolated from t. reesei including the counterparts of the genes ire <dig> and hac <dig>  as well as upr target genes such as pdi <dig>  in t. reesei and aspergillus niger splicing of hac1/haca mrna and hac1/haca promoter binding activity has been shown  <cit> . t. reesei and a. niger exhibit also transcriptional down regulation of genes encoding secreted proteins   <cit>  which has not been described in s. cerevisiae, but which is likely to be functional in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . whether this response is directly dependent on upr is currently not known.

in mammalian cells the upr genes are regulated mainly by the actions of ire1α and atf <dig> which activate the xbp <dig> transcription factor that induces the upr genes  <cit> . in addition, a pkr-like er kinase  is activated by unfolded proteins in the er and it phosphorylates the α subunit of the translation initiation factor  <dig>   <cit> . phosphorylation of eif2α leads to attenuation of general translation initiation, but also to a concomitant translational activation of selected proteins, including atf <dig>  <cit> , a homologue of s. cerevisiae gcn4p. atf <dig> is similarly activated by gcn <dig> during amino acid deprivation. however the atf <dig> mediated responses to secretion stress and amino acid deprivation appear to be distinct  <cit> . in secretion stress atf <dig> transcriptionally up-regulates genes in amino acid biosynthesis related functions apparently to relieve oxidative stress caused by protein secretion stress  <cit> .

t. reesei secretes large amounts of extracellular enzymes such as cellulase, which may set special demands for the capacity of its cells to fold and transport proteins. in agreement with this, the induction of cellulase production in t. reesei has been shown to coincide with upr induction  <cit> . in this study we have set out to characterise further the transcriptional responses of t. reesei during secretion stress. due to the lack of genome data when the work was initiated, we used cdna-subtraction and cdna-aflp methods in the analysis. responses to production of a heterologous protein and to treatment with the chemical agent dtt were studied. expression of the genes was analyzed also in a transformant over-expressing the ire <dig> gene and displaying constitutive upr induction. the genome sequence of s. cerevisiae has for long been available to the research community and the pathways for protein transport and upr signalling are well characterised. we combined transcriptome data from publications where various treatments causing secretion stress in s. cerevisiae had been studied and reanalysed it to define groups of genes upregulated or downregulated, either in upr dependent or independent manner. we provide, for the first time, such complete lists of gene groups for the research community. we compared these gene groups to the secretion stress induced genes detected by us in t. reesei. we discovered up regulation of the cpc1/gnc4/atf <dig> homologue of t. reesei in accordance with studies made with mammals and s. cerevisiae. interestingly also two nucleosome genes are up-regulated uniquely in t. reesei without a clear connection to cell cycle. the induction of the cpca and histone gene h <dig> were shown to be induced also in cultures of a. nidulans treated with dtt.

RESULTS
computational reanalysis of s. cerevisiae transcriptome data from secretion stress causing conditions
to better understand our transcriptome data on the responses to secretion stress in t. reesei, it was essential to evaluate the specificity of the responses to the type of stress imposed and to identify responses specific to t. reesei in particular. to enable reliable comparison we first combined the published data on the transcriptional responses to secretion stress related conditions in s. cerevisiae and analysed the data further. these were from s. cerevisiae cultures treated with dtt or tunicamycin to inhibit protein folding and transport  <cit> , and cultures of s. cerevisiae producing a secreted mouse histocompatibility protein  <cit>  . in order to analyse whether the observed transcriptional responses were dependent on the upr pathway genes hac <dig> and ire <dig>  the data sets were compared to the data from dtt and tunicamycin treatment of cultures of ire <dig> and hac <dig> deletion strains  <cit>  . in this analysis we used as reference data not yet induced early time points of dtt and heat shock time series experiments from  <cit>  as well as two randomly picked reference cultures from  <cit>  . genes showing significant differences in the expression between the secretion stress and reference cultures were selected using ranksum test, and the genes were divided into groups based on their expression pattern. briefly, for each gene we tested if there was a significant difference between expression values in experiment sets "treated wt" and "ref" and/or a significant difference between expression values in experiment sets "treated Δ" and "treated wt". the genes whose expression was up-regulated significantly by secretion stress  and for which this change was significantly dependent of ire <dig> and hac <dig>  were assigned to "coreupr" . those genes which were only significantly dependent of ire <dig> and hac <dig> , thus showing less change, were divided by comparing the median gene expression values of experiment sets into "upr dependent up" and "upr dependent down". respectively, genes which only changed significantly by secretion stress , were divided into "upr independent up" and "upr independent down". a detailed list of the genes in the groups is included as supplemental data. the expression of the genes in the different groups was also compared in other type of stress conditions in s. cerevisiae, including published data from  <dig> conditions. the data is summarised in fig.  <dig>  for comparison also the expression of the genes in the set described to be up regulated under upr conditions ire <dig> and hac <dig> dependently by  <cit>  is included.

the group of genes designated as "coreupr" contained  <dig> genes up regulated significantly and upr dependently under the secretion stress . the behaviour of this group is exceptional among the six gene groups shown in fig.  <dig>  it shows the least responses in the other stress conditions as the expression values of individual genes are mostly contained within the 2-fold limit . interestingly it responds slightly to diamide treatment in data of  <cit> , like the upr gene set described by  <cit> .

in addition to the "coreupr" genes, a group of  <dig> genes showed significant dependence on upr and were up regulated . however they are not as strongly upr-regulated, as they have no significant difference between gene expression values of experiment sets "treated wt" and "ref".  <dig> genes showed upr dependence and were down regulated . some of the genes in the groups "upr dependent up" and "upr dependent down" genes showed responses also in other stress conditions. in many cases the responses of the up regulated and down regulated genes were characterised by slightly opposite behaviour also in other stress conditions. for example, the median of the group of "upr dependent up" genes was slightly higher also in the hypo-osmotic shock conditions whereas the median of the "upr dependent down" genes was lower in these conditions.

 <dig> genes were assigned to groups "upr independent up" and  <dig> "upr independent down". these gene groups , in contrast to upr dependent gene groups, were effected also by many other types of stress. for example  <dig> of "upr dependent up" and  <dig> of "upr dependent down" group members are environmental stress genes, a form of general stress response defined by  <cit> . genes assigned to groups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  described, provided and plotted in supplemental data, were judged to be outside the scope of this publication.

the content of the gene groups was compared also based on the number of genes in different function and location categories . all gene groups up-regulated under secretion stress contained a higher percentage of secretion related genes compared to the total of the genome content of s. cerevisiae, whereas the down regulated gene groups showed a lower percentage of secretion related genes compared to the genome content . especially in the "coreupr" group the secretion related genes were overrepresented, 63% of the genes vs. 26% of the genes in the whole genome. the second most prominent category was the genes related to transcription. in the gene group "upr dependent up" the percentage of transcription related genes is well above their total amount in the genome, 26% vs. 17%. it is of interest that there is little evidence for down regulation of genes encoding secreted proteins in s. cerevisiae transcriptome data in secretion stress conditions . in total, ten transcripts encoding proteins localised outside the cell showed down regulation independently of upr, but this is only 15% of the genes encoding extracellular proteins in s. cerevisiae and the possible targets for the ress phenomenon described in filamentous fungi  <cit> .

est collection derived from cdna-aflp and cdna subtraction library analysis of t. reesei cultures under secretion stress conditions
in order to identify genes that are differentially expressed in response to secretion stress in t. reesei, we prepared cdna subtraction libraries from chemostat cultures of a tpa producing transformant of t. reesei rut-c <dig> and its parental strain and from a batch bioreactor culture of t. reesei rut-c <dig> treated with dtt and an untreated reference culture. in addition, the same cultures were subjected to cdna-aflp analysis to gather additional information using another method.

in preparation of the subtraction libraries, the sample and reference libraries were hybridised repeatedly to enrich fragments that are more abundant in the sample library. progress of hybridisations was monitored by hybridising dna probes such as bip <dig> and pdi <dig> gene fragments to dotplots of libraries and measuring the amount cdna removed from libraries in each hybridisation cycle by radioactivity. even after one round of hybridisation a clear selective enrichement of bip <dig> and pdi <dig> mrna could be seen. in each hybridisation round some cdna was removed indicating removal of non-regulated genes . to cover broadly the produced libraries, four of those were selected for further analysis: libraries representing the culture treated with dtt for  <dig> min after  <dig> and  <dig> hybridisation cycles and libraries representing the tpa producing culture after  <dig> and  <dig> hybridisation cycles. in the cdna-aflp experiment the sample and reference cdnas are amplified by a pcr based protocol and fractionated using electrophoresis. bands that showed very clear up regulation in both  stressed samples were sequenced.

in total  <dig> individual est sequences were retrieved, including  <dig> fragments obtained from the cdna-aflp analysis. the orfs corresponding to the ests were identified based on sequence similarity searches against the prepublication version of the t. reesei genome and the predicted t. reesei proteome, and subsequently the putative homologues of the corresponding orfs were identified in the s. cerevisiae genome  <cit>  and swissprot  <cit> . annotation of previously uncharacterised genes in t. reesei was done based on sequence similarity of the predicted orfs of s. cerevisiae, since the s. cerevisiae genome annotation is much more advanced compared to other fungal species, and the upr response of s. cerevisiae is characterised in detail. the est sequences representing the tpa gene  were removed from the dataset before further analysis. remaining  <dig> sequences were submitted to embl with accession numbers am <dig> – am <dig>  as multiple short ests can be produced for an individual gene by the methods used, the number of ests does not reveal the number of orfs present in cdna subtraction libraries or selected by cdna-aflp analysis.  <dig> ests were found to correspond to  <dig> predicted orfs in the genomic sequence. in addition  <dig> ests matched outside the predicted orfs in the t. reesei genome version used and two of the ests matched to the mitochondrial genome published earlier  <cit> . these  <dig> sequences are likely to correspond to  <dig> orfs.  <dig> sequences did not find a match in the currently available t. reesei sequences. these correspond to  <dig> unique sequences that remained completely unidentified.

some differences were detected in the content of the libraries and in the abundance of ests corresponding to a particular gene. ests of some upr related genes  were more abundant in the library derived from the dtt treated culture compared to the library from the tpa cultivation, while some genes showed an opposite trend . only one cellobiohydrolase est was found in the dtt treatment library while  <dig> were found in the tpa cultivation library. half of orfs in the libraries were represented only by a single est preventing further analysis of significant differences between the libraries. thus, combined content of the est libraries is presented if not otherwise stated. a list of identified orfs is provided in the supplemental data.

39% of the t. reesei orfs found in the subtraction libraries or using cdna-aflp analysis and for which a putative function could be assigned were related to protein secretion  which is well above the frequency of the appearance of secretion related genes in s. cerevisiae genome. the number of genes involved in transcription in the t. reesei est collection was close to the relative amount of the transcription related genes that are up regulated in a upr dependent manner in s. cerevisiae as defined by  <cit> . both frequencies are lower than the frequency of transcription related genes in the s. cerevisiae genome. the more detailed dissection of the upr up regulated genes of s. cerevisiae to the "coreupr" genes and "upr dependent up" in our study revealed a stronger segregation between the secretion related genes to the two groups, 63% of the "coreupr" genes were secretion related whereas of the "upr dependent up" only 31%. also the frequency of genes involved in transcription differed in the two groups, only 7% of the genes in the group of coreupr were transcription related genes, whereas 26% of the "upr dependent up" genes were involved in transcription.

interestingly, a more detailed comparison of the genes represented in the t. reesei est set and the upr dependently up-regulated genes revealed by our data analysis or by  <cit>  showed relatively few homologous genes in common. however, no genomic scale data exists about functional homology relationships between t. reesei and s. cerevisiae genes to enable interpretation of this.

our analysis of genes up-regulated in t. reesei under secretion stress conditions revealed also features that clearly differ from the ones observed in s. cerevisiae. the set of t. reesei ests representing putative secretion stress related genes contained many est corresponding to cpc <dig>  homolog of the s. cerevisiae gcn <dig>  as well as three histone genes. neither gcn <dig> nor histone genes were shown to be up regulated in our reanalysis of s. cerevisiae transcriptome data. instead gcn4p has been shown to be translationally induced  <cit> . expression of cpc <dig> and histone genes under secretion stress in t. reesei was analysed in more detail as described below.

northern analysis of a selected set of genes corresponding to the ests revealed by the cdna subtraction and cdna-aflp analysis
to confirm the regulation of genes revealed by the cdna subtraction and cdna-aflp analyses we first selected a random set of genes corresponding to ests and checked induction of the genes using northern analysis. in the set of  <dig> genes, twelve genes showed more than 2-fold induction after one hour treatment with dtt indicating that about half of the unique genes of the est library derived from the dtt treated culture are actually induced . after the random initial set of northern analyses, we chose to analyse expression levels of genes that could reveal essential new features of t. reesei secretion stress.  <dig> novel candidates for upr related genes, based on the functional assignments of the homologous genes in other organisms were selected for the analysis. the genes bip <dig> and pdi <dig> known to be induced under these conditions were included in the study for comparison. deletion strains of t. reesei ire <dig> or hac <dig> have not been obtained and could not be used in the analysis of upr dependent gene expression in t. reesei. therefore we defined genes showing upr-like regulation as genes significantly induced  after one hour treatment of the culture with dtt, as well as in culture of the tpa producing transformant and in culture of the ire <dig> overexpressing strain that shows constitutive activation of the regulator hac <dig> and induction of its target genes  <cit> . however, this does not formally exclude the possibility that the induction of a certain gene could not be caused by a non-secretion stress specific pathway. by these criteria,  <dig> genes out of the set of  <dig> showed upr-like regulation . nine of these genes belong to the categories previously described as upr related  such as genes involved in translocation, er calcium homeostasis, folding, glycosylation, vesicle trafficking and cell wall biosynthesis. the remaining  <dig> genes revealed novel features in the secretion stress in t. reesei, and are described more in detail below.

nucleosomal genes are induced in secretion stress in t. reesei
as shown in table  <dig>  many ests corresponding to histone h2a gene are present in the secretion stress up-regulated est collection, and based on northern analysis, the genes for histone 2a and  <dig> are expressed in an upr-like manner . the h2a and h2b genes are closely linked in the t. reesei genome as are the h <dig> and h <dig> genes. the number and localisation of t. reesei histone orfs resemble, but are not identical to the histone gene organisation of the filamentous fungi aspergillus nidulans  <cit>  and neurospora crassa  <cit> .

in order to elucidate whether the induction of histones in secretion stress is more widespread in filamentous fungi and not only limited to t. reesei, the expression level of the gene encoding the h <dig> core histone was analysed in a dtt treated culture of a. nidulans. the analysis showed a 2-fold induction of the gene between  <dig> minutes and  <dig> minutes of dtt treatment .

cpc1/gcn <dig> is induced in t. reesei and a. nidulans secretion stress
ests corresponding to the t. reesei homologue of cpc <dig>  in n. crassa  are abundant both in the subtraction library derived from the dtt treated culture as well as in the one derived from the tpa producing culture . based on northern analysis, the expression level of the gene was induced in the dtt treated culture as well as in cultures producing tpa or overexpressing ire <dig>  thus indicating upr-like regulation .

also the homologue for the s. cerevisiae mbf <dig> was isolated from the subtraction libraries and was among the upr induced genes . s. cerevisiae mbf1p is a transcriptional co-activator, that has been shown to mediate gcn4p dependent transcriptional activation by bridging the dna binding region of gcn4p and spt15p   <cit> . however, mbf <dig> has not been described as a gcn4p target  <cit> . the secretion stress up-regulated est collection contained also several ests corresponding to putative homologues of s. cerevisiae spt <dig> and taf <dig> .

to study expression of t. reesei cpc <dig> target genes under secretion stress conditions, putative candidates for cpci targets in the t. reesei prepublication version of the genome were identified based on sequence similarity searches against predicted s. cerevisiae gcn4p targets  <cit> . among these we selected genes that were represented in the est collection or that were available as cloned ests from  <cit> . additionally we selected trx <dig>  trx <dig>  gsr <dig> , and gsh <dig> due to their role in glutathione metabolism. northern analysis of the genes under secretion stress conditions was carried out . of the selected set of genes, glt <dig> , arg <dig>  and aro <dig>  showed upr-like regulation. also asn <dig>  was induced almost 2-fold in the ire <dig> over-expressing strain and cys <dig>  was more than  <dig> -fold induced after one hour of dtt treatment, but the genes were induced to a lesser extent in the other conditions studied.

the glutathione s-transferases  are a family of enzymes involved in the detoxification of oxygen radicals and other reactive intermediates . a putative homologue of a human microsomal glutathione s-transferase  <dig> gene  was found among the ests representing genes up-regulated under secretion stress. upr-like regulation of the gene in t. reesei was confirmed using northern analysis .

the induction of cpc <dig> in secretion stress was confirmed also to take place in the dtt treated culture of a. nidulans. the gene cpca was induced 2-fold after  <dig> min treatment with dtt .

amino acid biosynthesis genes seem not to be induced in s. cerevisiae by secretion stress
in contrast to our finding in t. reesei, the gcn <dig> of s. cerevisiae has not been shown to be induced under secretion stress  <cit> . however, activation of gcn4p synthesis has been reported under tunicamycin treatment in s. cerevisiae  <cit> . as secretion stress in t. reesei resulted in induction of also a set of putative target genes of the gcn <dig> homologue cpci, including some amino acid biosynthesis genes, we compared the expression of the putative gcn4p targets in the transcriptome profiling data set combined from literature.

fig.  <dig> shows expression data on the amino acid biosynthesis genes that have been indicated as gcn4p targets based on transcriptional profiling data on s. cerevisiae strains with constitutive gcn <dig> expression or gcn <dig> deletion  <cit> . these genes are clearly induced in amino acid or nitrogen depletion conditions  <cit> , the median gene expression value of the gene set showing 2-fold induction. in secretion stress conditions  the median log <dig> ratio of the gene set is  <dig>  except in one reference experiment  and in tunicamycin treatment , both derived from data by  <cit> . the gcn4p target gene sets selected based on computational predictions  <cit>  show the same result in the expression profiling data although their response to amino acid depletion is less pronounced .

no clear lack of amino acids can be detected from t. reesei cells under secretion stress
as cpc genes are known to be induced transcriptionally in response to amino acid deprivation in filamentous fungi  <cit> , we wanted to determine whether there was such a lack in t. reesei in our culture conditions. the concentrations of total intracellular free amino acids were determined from tpa producing strain, a dtt treated culture and culture of ire <dig> over expression strain and their respective reference cultivations by hplc. of the  <dig> standard amino acids  <dig> were determined successfully. no systematic decrease of concentration of a single amino acid in all cultivations could be seen. instead in dtt treated culture after  <dig> min the concentrations of alanine, arginine, and threonine were at  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , fold higher level  compared to the reference culture.

discussion
computational reanalysis of published s. cerevisiae transcriptome profiling data allows the dissection of the effects of secretion stress
s. cerevisiae has served as one of the model organisms in studies on protein secretion and on factors affecting the process. the mechanisms of the unfolded protein response  activated under conditions where protein folding and transport is hampered is well characterised in s. cerevisiae, and transcriptional profiling data on the responses to impaired secretion process i.e. secretion stress inducing conditions, is available from various sources  <cit> . in addition there is data on responses to a large variety of other type of stress conditions. in order to create a consensus model of the responses to secretion stress in s. cerevisiae and to enable comparison of the corresponding responses in other organisms, we have combined the transcriptional profiling data currently available in literature. in comparison to previous studies of transcriptomic effects of secretion stress, we used a larger and more varied data set as it was combined from all the previous studies. this enables exclusion of effects specific to inducer of stress , the specific amount of chemical or the strain used. we also provide lists of genes upregulated or downregulated, either in upr dependent or independent manner. this computational analysis provided a robust dissection of transcriptional effects of secretion stress in s. cerevisiae to compare our results of transcriptional effects of secretion stress in t. reesei.

our analysis of the combined data on secretion stress in s. cerevisiae revealed eight specific groups of genes showing differential expression under the secretion stress conditions. namely, the model selected a group of  <dig> strongly responding upr-dependent genes , that were mainly up-regulated under the secretion stress conditions and not as a response to other type of stresses, and another group of  <dig> upr-dependent up-regulated genes showing less stringent response to secretion stress . both groups, but especially the "coreupr" group, had a higher content of secretion related genes compared to the relative amount of secretion related genes in the genome, which is in accordance with previous information on the functional categories of upr up-regulated genes  <cit> .  <cit>  previously identified a set of  <dig> genes induced in a upr dependent manner  based on their similar behaviour to predefined model upr genes  in transcriptional profiling experiment. our test showed only  <dig> of these genes to be upr dependently induced . the analysis revealed also a large number of genes that were up regulated  or down regulated  under secretion stress conditions, but not in a upr dependent manner that would require functional ire <dig> and hac <dig> genes.  <dig> genes of the upr related genes from  <cit>  were assigned to "upr independent up". the genes in these groups were responsive also to other type of stress conditions , indicating that they are regulated probably through general stress pathways.

t. reesei, aspergillus niger and aspergillus nidulans, exhibit transcriptional down regulation of secreted proteins in secretion stress   <cit> . it has been also shown in plant cultures  that many of the genes encoding proteins with putative signal sequences are down-regulated during treatment with dtt or tunicamycin  <cit> . for s. cerevisiae this has not been reported, and as shown by the trancriptome profiling studies for s. cerevisiae secretion stress  <cit>  and by our computational analysis , only a few secreted proteins show down regulation in their transcript amounts under secretion stress in s. cerevisiae. as the transcriptomic responses of a. nidulans  <cit>  and in a. thaliana  <cit>  appear to affect larger amount of genes encoding secreted proteins, it is very likely that s. cerevisiae does not have the ress response.

analysis of the est collection reveals novel aspects of secretion stress in t. reesei
transcriptomic responses in t. reesei secretion stress were studied under different conditions provoking secretion stress. cdna subtraction library and cdna-aflp analyses were carried out from cultures producing a heterologous protein, tpa, and from cultures treated with dtt to prevent protein transport and folding. furthermore, cultures of a strain overexpressing the upr pathway regulator gene ire <dig> were included in a further study for confirmation of induction of a selected set of genes under secretion stress using northern analysis. the results from the combined analysis of the est collection of different conditions confirmed the published results on the induction of previously characterised upr related genes, such as of bip <dig> and pdi <dig>  <cit>  . furthermore, ests corresponding to at least  <dig> genes putatively involved in secretion stress in t. reesei were isolated. the est collection contained genes from functional categories expected to be up regulated under secretion stress conditions based on transcriptomic studies in a. thaliana, a. nidulans and s. cerevisiae  <cit>  and it was clearly enriched in the number of secretion related genes as compared to the genome content of secretion related genes of s. cerevisiae .

the responses induced by production of a heterologous protein and by the dtt treatment might also have features specific to each of these two conditions and therefore we have focused on genes under differential expression in all culture conditions. a gene was classified as a upr-like gene if it was confirmed by northern analysis to be up regulated after one-hour-treatment with dtt, in a tpa producing culture as well as in a strain overexpressing ire <dig>  northern analysis of a set of genes selected from the est collection revealed upr-like up regulation of a group of genes expected to be upr up-regulated based on data obtained from other organisms, e.g. bip <dig>  pdi <dig>  ero <dig>  pmr <dig> and sec <dig> or belonging to functional categories upr up-regulated in other organisms sec <dig>  ypt <dig>  ste <dig>  erv <dig>  <cit>  . many of the genes analysed by northern analysis were induced at a lower level in the tpa producing culture than in the dtt treated culture or in the strain overexpressing ire <dig> . this was reflected also in the abundance of ests corresponding to the differentially expressed genes in the different libraries, as demonstrated by the abundantly expressed foldase/chaperon genes pdi <dig> and bip <dig> . in addition, the analysis revealed induction of genes that have not been described as upr induced in filamentous fungi or yeast, which are discussed more in detail below.

nucleosomal genes were induced as a response to secretion stress in t. reesei indicating uncoupling of their regulation from cell cycle control
the core histones are generally thought to be strictly regulated with cell cycle, active synthesis taking place during the s-phase  <cit> . s. cerevisiae transcriptome data collected for this study indicate that if some regulation of nucleosomal genes as a response to stress is taking place, it is primarily down regulation, and no up regulation is seen under secretion stress conditions . on the contrary, the histone genes h2a and h <dig> were induced in t. reesei secretion stress in a upr-like manner . a transient induction of h <dig> histone gene was also observed in cultures of a nidulans subjected to dtt treatment , indicating that the nucleasomal induction could be a more common phenomenon in the filamentous fungi. the induction of h2a and h <dig> appears to have no correlation with growth rate of the cells. the comparison of the expression levels of the genes in the tpa producing strain and in its parental reference strain was carried out in well controlled chemostat cultures with the same specific growth rate. growth activation could not explain the induction either, since the treatment of the cultures with dtt retards the growth to some extent, and also the ire <dig> overexpression does not lead to increased growth of the fungus. further studies are required to elucidate the significance of the increased histone gene expression under conditions where no obvious increase in dna synthesis takes place.

cpc <dig> induction of t. reesei resembles atf <dig> controlled secretion stress response in mice
the t. reesei est collection of genes upregulated under secretion stress contained many ests homologous to cpc genes of filamentous fungi or to the counterpart in s. cerevisiae, gcn <dig> . upr-like regulation of the gene in t. reesei was confirmed by northern analysis . the cpc proteins in filamentous fungi as well as the s. cerevisiae gcn <dig> have been shown to control amino acid biosynthesis  <cit> . gcn <dig> is thought to be involved also in responses to purine starvation, glucose limitation, growth on ethanol, high salinity, treatment with methyl methanesulfonate and treatment with rapamycin . a notable difference in activation of the cpc homologues and gcn <dig> in response to amino acid deprivation is that s. cerevisiae gcn <dig> is mostly regulated on translational level  <cit>  whereas the cpc-proteins in filamentous fungi are also under strong transcriptional control  <cit> . the s. cerevisiae gcn4p and the mouse homologue atf <dig> have also been shown to be involved in secretion stress  <cit> . in s. cerevisiae, gcn4p is required for induction of the majority of upr induced genes under secretion stress  <cit> . mouse atf4p appears to transcriptionally induce genes involved in glutathione biosynthesis under tunicamycin treatment. it has been suggested based on a variety of functional assays that the lack of reducing power and the need to up regulate glutathione biosynthesis were the major reasons for atf <dig> induction in mouse under secretion stress conditions  <cit> .

we carried out a northern analysis in secretion stress conditions of a set of t. reesei genes whose homologues in s. cerevisiae have been shown to be gcn4p targets based either on computational promoter analysis  <cit>  or microarray experiments  <cit> . as the role of cpc proteins in regulation of amino acid biosynthesis is very similar in s. cerevisiae and in filamentous fungi, it is likely that many of these selected genes are cpc <dig> targets also in t. reesei. the genes glt <dig>  arg <dig> and aro <dig> were shown to be upr induced genes in t. reesei based on the northern analysis. in addition, the gene asn <dig> was induced almost 2-fold in the ire <dig> over-expressing strain and cys <dig> was induced more than  <dig> -fold after one hour dtt treatment . in mice a homologue of asn <dig>  asparagine synthase  and a homologue of cys <dig>  cystathione γ-lyase  which follows cys <dig> in homocysteine and cysteine interconversion – pathway, show an atf <dig> dependent regulation in secretion stress  <cit> . the glutathione biosynthesis gene gsh <dig>  thioredoxin genes  and glutathione reductase  involved in glutathione related functions do not show up regulation in t. reesei, which is also the case for their homologues in mouse  <cit> . glni that synthesises glutamine from glutamate instead of glutathione neither shows any induction. at transcript level our results with t. reesei are in accordance with the observations in mouse in that not all the genes putatively under atf <dig> regulation or involved in glutathione metabolism are affected under secretion stress conditions.

in mice, glutathione-s-transferases are activated to protect cells from oxidative stress  <cit>  and in er stress conditions  <cit> . the homologue of human microsomal glutathione s-transferase  <dig>  was also among the upr activated genes in t. reesei . in order to determine whether induction of cpc <dig> in t. reesei could be due to amino acid starvation, we determined intracellular total concentrations of  <dig> amino acids. no systematic lack of any of these amino acids in all conditions was detected. based on the assembled evidence we believe that t. reesei is manifesting a response similar to the atf <dig> dependent response of mouse.

CONCLUSIONS
we have isolated a rather large variety of genes as putative candidates for secretion stress related genes in t. reesei. further analysis of the genes induced under secretion stress has revealed novel features in the stress response in t. reesei and in filamentous fungi. we have demonstrated that in addition to the previously rather well characterised induction of genes for many er proteins or secretion related proteins also other types of responses exist. nucleosome genes were induced both in t. reesei and in a. nidulans, this response has not previously been found from other organisms. furthermore our results suggest that the response to secretion stress in t. reesei has similarities to mammalian cells in the role of cpc1/atf <dig>  which has been suggested to enhance, together with a subset of its target genes, glutathione synthesis and to alleviate oxidative stress in the er. further studies are needed to fully uncover the role of cpc <dig> in secretion stress in t. reesei and to elucidate whether the regulatory mechanisms of upr involve also cpci as a direct transcriptional factor involved in activation of upr target genes in a similar manner as the gcn4p in s. cerevisiae  <cit> .
