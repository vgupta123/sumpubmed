BACKGROUND
the eav retrovirus family likely originated from a primordial integration event prior to the evolutionary speciation of gallus sp.  <cit> , and show sequence similarity with the less ancient ev loci  <cit> . some eav elements might be related to the avian leukosis virus  genus , and owing to high env sequence identity between eav and alv genomes, recombination events involving eav-hp may have led to the emergence of the alv subgroup j . further support for recombination as the origin of alv-j is evident in the avian retrotransposon art-ch, where the r and u <dig> regions of the art-ch long terminal repeat  are 97 % identical to the eav-hp ltr, while the u <dig> region is distinct from any other retrovirus  <cit> . the active spread of eav-hp in modern chickens is believed to involve a helper virus due to the numerous point mutations, deletions and insertions in eav-hp sequences inactivating viral gene products  <cit> , and that none of the proviruses found to date have been observed to produce infectious virions  <cit> .

exogenous retroviruses infect their specific target cells and integrate as a provirus into the cellular genome by transcribing their rna genome into dna by reverse transcription  <cit> . once integrated into the germ line of a species it becomes endogenised. parts of the endogenous virus may be eliminated or disrupted by random mutation events, preventing expression of functional viral proteins and the ability to replicate  <cit> . consequently, remnants of endogenous retroviruses  at varying states of integrity are present in vertebrate genomes and can be observed in re-sequencing data. an analysis of reference genome sequences by stoye  <cit>  suggests that 4–10 % of vertebrate dna is composed of retroviral remnants.

a review of retrovirus integration site selection  <cit>  supports the view that the integration of retroviruses at random genomic locations in vivo is unlikely to be true for all retroviruses. this review also suggests that integration site preference is often retrovirus but not host-specific. that is to say the same distribution of site preference has been observed in specific retroviridae across a range of mammalian and avian host species. bolisetty et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> alpharetroviruses in the chicken genome; this retrovirus genus includes the eav retroviruses. desfarges and ciuffi  <cit>  indicate that alpharetroviruses display a weak preference for integration in transcription units of genes and cpg islands, which are enriched in gene-rich regions. this is consistent with the eav-hp integration sites identified for the oocyan phenotype in chicken  <cit> , which integrates into the promoter region of slco1b <dig>  bolisetty et al.  <cit>  report a near random distribution of erv integration sites, although this may be an artefact of the preferences of different retrovirus genera. they also indicate that many ervs are transcribed and translated, and that some are expressed in a tissue-specific manner.

the increasing awareness over the interplay and co-evolution of virus and host has led to the concept of viral symbiosis  <cit> . despite being novel to the host genome, the virus is pre-evolved to interact with it at the genetic level. it may contribute genes and/or regulatory sequences to their host, thus conferring a selective advantage. for the virus, successful integration into the host genome offers the prospect of long-term survival and future transmission  <cit> . the infectious nature of retroviruses, and the capacity of some to become endogenous, offers extraordinary potential to generate heritable diversity in the host genome. multiple integrations typically occur during endogenisation, and each of these events has the potential to regulate host gene expression given the appropriate integration site. as with any mutation, selection will favour integration sites that enhance the survival of the host, and select against those that impair it. the abundance of retroviruses may therefore play an important role in the adaptation and evolution of the host species  <cit> .

here, we assess the prevalence of eav-hp in chickens with different breeding histories. for this purpose we apply an innovative strategy utilising high-coverage, paired-end next-generation sequencing  data from re-sequenced chickens, to define eav-hp integration sites . the chickens analysed included eight inbred lines of white leghorn currently maintained at the pirbright institute , and due to be relocated to the national avian research facility , a silkie, a taiwan country chicken, a red junglefowl, and village chickens from horro  and jarso  regions of ethiopia. specifically, we aim to contribute answers to the following questions: how common are eav-hp integrations? do they show a pattern of lineage specificity? what can we infer about the history of such integrations? do the integrations occur at random across the chicken genome? and if not, is there any evolutionary significance to their distribution?fig.  <dig> overview of the retrovirus mapping strategy. paired-end sequencing reads from re-sequencing of chicken genomes are mapped to both galgal <dig>  and the ltr of the eav-hp genome . unmapped reads from the eav-hp ltr alignment, which may map either to the host genome or other elements of the viral sequence, are recovered and mapped to the chicken reference genome to generate a list of observed integration sites . for each integration sites, paired-end reads are retrieved from the initial mapping to galgal <dig>  and remapped to the ltr of the eav-hp genome , and the soft-clipped sequences of mapped reads recovered . these sequences are then aligned to galgal <dig> using blat, and the results referenced against the interval in question to identify the integration site breakpoint



RESULTS
prevalence and distribution of eav-hp integration sites
alignment of pair-end reads resulted in a genome-wide mean depth of coverage against galgal <dig> of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in ethiopian birds and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in pirbright lines, whilst in the individual birds downloaded from the sra it was  <dig>  in the rjf,  <dig>  in the silkie and  <dig>  in the taiwanese bird . following alignment of the sequence reads to the eav-hp ltr, and subsequence re-alignment of unmapped reads to galgal <dig>  a total of  <dig> integration sites were identified . the mean depth of coverage for sequence reads to the eav-hp ltr was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in ethiopian chickens,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in pirbright lines, and 16 ±  <dig>  in the sra data, respectively. on average, 31 % of sites contained reads aligning to 100 % of the u <dig> region  of the ltr sequence, 32 % of sites contained reads aligning to 100 % of the u <dig> region , whilst the complete r region  was captured in 89 % of sites. overall, the complete ltr sequence was captured in approximately 20 % of sites.

integration sites within and across birds and lines with less than 5 kb intervening genomic sequence were classified as a single interval. similarly, isolated integration sites, those for which no other integration site was identified within 5 kb, were classified as an interval. this reduced the  <dig> integration sites into a set of  <dig> intervals for comparative analyses . the ratio of intervals to integrations was  <dig>  in ethiopian chickens,  <dig>  pirbright lines, and  <dig>  in the sra data, indicating an average fraction of  <dig>  integration sites to be clustered. importantly, one of the jarso chickens  was sequenced twice at the comparable genome coverage using independent libraries, and the results of each sequencing run analysed independently. across both libraries the resulting intervals detected were identical .

a summary of the distribution of observed eav-hp integration site intervals for each re-sequenced genome, on the macro- , intermediate  and micro-chromosomes , in addition to the z chromosome and several unplaced contigs, is presented in fig.  <dig>  of the  <dig> intervals observed, 72 % mapped to macrochromosomes, 9 % to the intermediate-sized chromosomes, 7 % to microchromosomes and 8 % to the z chromosome, whilst the remaining 4 % mapped to unplaced contigs . a positive correlation was observed between chromosome length and interval density , whilst a negative correlation was observed between gene and interval density . we also observed that 27 % of intervals occur within 5 kb of transcripts . this is less than might be expected by chance given that approximately 41 % of the chicken genome is transcribed. microchromosomes are both cpg and g + c rich, and have a higher rate of recombination than macrochromosomes  <cit> , which might facilitate excision of retroviral insertions during meiosis. furthermore, gene density in the chicken has been shown to be inversely correlated with chromosome length  <cit> . assuming there to be no target-site preference for eav-hp, the results suggests that the chicken host retains some integrations within genes or regulatory regions, possibly due to them conferring a selective advantage, whilst others might be more rapidly excised, in agreement with the concept of viral symbiosis  <cit> .fig.  <dig> distribution of observed eav-hp integration sites. outer circos plot indicates distribution of observed eav-hp integration sites. inner stacked histogram summarizes percentage of integration sites for each line along macro-, intermediate, and micro-chromosomes, in addition to the z chromosome and unlocalized/unplaced contigs. the latter relates to integration sites mapped to contigs present in the reference assembly  that are either associated with a specific chromosome but unlocalized, or have not yet been associated with any chromosome



we identify an average of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  intervals per bird. this is much higher than the 10– <dig> integrations suggested in previous studies of inbred lines and the red junglefowl based on southern blot hybridisation with env  <cit>  and ltr sequences  <cit> . however, it is comparable to that observed in a more recent analysis of the galgal <dig> reference genome by bolisetty et al.  <cit>  using retrotector  <cit> , in which they identified  <dig> alpharetroviruses in addition to an alphabeta clade which contained  <dig> viruses, two thirds of which were highly similar to previously described eavs.

the precise identification of individual endogenous retroviruses can be problematic due to the extent of sequence diversity observed in mutable proviruses, the level of sequence integrity once a retrovirus becomes endogenised and subject to host recombination, and the level of sequence similarity observed in closely related retroviruses . however, eav-hp has a distinct u <dig> region  <cit>  which could be used to generate a more conservative estimate of integration sites if one wished. taking only into consideration the 31 % of integration sites with 100 % sequence coverage of the u <dig> region, an average of  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  sites per bird are present in ethiopian chickens, pirbright lines and the sra data, respectively. these values more closely resemble the previously reported southern blot hybridisation results  <cit> .

in total, 66 % of the eav-hp ltr alignments to galgal <dig> identified by blat  were detected as integration sites in the rjf sample. several filters are applied to the integrations detected during the pipeline including mapping quality  and read count . an evaluation of these is presented in the additional file 2: supplementary methods. relaxing the mq filter applied in the pipeline can result in both sensitivity and precision > 95 %, however the mq filter is applied to reduce the risk of false positives arising from multiple mapping hits for an integration – for instance if an integration were to occur within an interspersed repetitive element such as cr <dig>  the parameters applied herein  result in 98 % precision and 66 % sensitivity when comparing interval detection in the rjf ngs data to eav-hp ltr blat alignments to galgal <dig> 

fourteen intervals were present at high frequency  in the chicken genomes analysed, and eight of these were present in all birds . the presence of these intervals was confirmed in the chicken reference genome  following alignment of the eav-hp ltr sequence using blat . furthermore, visual examination of the results of the blat alignment of soft-clipped sequences from each interval allowed the integration site breakpoints to be identified. the integration site breakpoints were found to be identical in each bird, suggesting that they likely occurred prior to domestication. a blat of the complete eav-hp sequence  indicates some of these high frequency intervals in galgal <dig> to host large remnants  of eav-hp sequence, although none of the alignments are complete. additional sequencing would be require to establish the integrity of the eav-hp sequences in these intervals for the other birds/lines. single  <cit>  and multiple  domestication events have been suggested for domestic chicken, which may have involved several red junglefowl subspecies and introgression from other junglefowl species  <cit> . whether or not such retroviral insertions might prove informative in this regard will require the genome analysis of different wild junglefowl species and subspecies.

three of these candidate pre-domestication integration sites are localised to within 5 kb of a gene: cntn <dig> at chr1: <dig> ,847- <dig> , <dig> , atpbd <dig> at chr5: <dig> ,866- <dig> , <dig> , and c10orf <dig> at chr6: <dig> ,843- <dig> , <dig> . contactin  <dig>  is a member of the immunoglobulin super family; innatedb  <cit>  indicates that in mice atpbd <dig> has been demonstrated to interact with stat <dig>  which has been implicated in the innate immune system of mice and humans  <cit> ; whilst c10orf <dig> is involved in melanocyte differentiation  <cit> .

seven intervals were found to be at high frequency  in chickens from either horro or jarso, whilst being at low frequency  in the other chickens . one of these  was present in 100 % of individuals from jarso, whilst remaining absent in all the other birds and lines examined, including the reference genome. the soft-clipping of reads within this region suggested an integration site breakpoint at either chr3: <dig> , <dig> or chr3: <dig> , <dig>  consistent with the size of a target site duplication during integration, which would localise such an integration event into a large intron between exons  <dig> and  <dig> of a novel protein coding gene likely to be involved in intracellular signalling . all jarso birds indicate 100 % sequence coverage of the eav-hp ltr at this interval. another of the intervals , present in all but one of the jarso chickens and absent in all other birds, suggests an integration site at chr8: <dig> , <dig>  this site is located within an intron between exons  <dig> and  <dig> of the dypd gene, which encodes a protein involved in uracil and thymidine catabolism. in all birds possessing this interval, sequence coverage of the ltr u <dig> region is only 5 %, whilst the r and u <dig> regions ≥ 99 % coverage.

no evidence was found for different integration site breakpoints in the genome between individuals within an interval. in the event that two breakpoints were observed within an interval, they were found either to be 6 bp apart, corresponding to the size of a target-site duplication and so might be attributed to soft-clipped reads from the ltr at either end of the virus , or the integration was present in the reference genome and the breakpoints corresponded closely with the ltr alignment . this is in contrast to that which has been recently observed at the oocyan locus for chinese and south american chicken populations  <cit> .

a single interval  was found to be present in 90 % of ethiopian birds but absent in the pirbright lines, red junglefowl, silkie and taiwan chickens, in addition to the reference genome . with the exception of the ethiopian chicken  in which the interval was not identified, the breakpoint was identical across all chickens at chr4: <dig> , <dig>  as was the coverage for the u <dig> , r  and u <dig>  regions of the ltr. a single gene is located within 5 kb of the interval, mmaa, which encodes a protein involved in the translocation of cobalamin into the mitochondrion for the biosynthesis of adenosylcobalamin, an active form of vitamin b <dig>  the possible consequence of this integration remains speculative, with the low sequence coverage of the ltr u <dig> region making it unlikely to contribute a regulatory role. also, deficiency of vitamin b <dig> would be surprising in domestic birds raised on commercial feed, or in scavenging village chicken whose diet likely includes insects and other arthropods.

given the heritable nature of ervs, one would expect to observe population structure when evaluating the erv integration sites of individuals from within and across different populations. to investigate this further a neighbour-joining tree was constructed using the mitochondrial sequence from each bird , the results of which were compared to a network analysis performed on a distance matrix of the erv intervals present in each chicken . both analyses clearly separate the populations of ethiopian chickens from the pirbright lines, and further sub-structuring is observed within the ethiopian chickens; segregating the sub-populations of horro and jarso. the distinction between chickens from horro and jarso is not surprising given that these two indigenous populations are separated by more than 800 km and that communities from the areas have witnessed different histories, with jarso and horro now of predominantly of muslim and christian faith, respectively  <cit> . as a likely consequence of geographic and human history, little inter-population gene-flow might be expected, as reflected in the eav-hp integration site network. the red junglefowl, silkie and taiwan chickens form an intermediary group more closely related to the ethiopian chickens than the pirbright lines.fig.  <dig> mtdna phylogeny and network analysis of eav-hp integration sites. analysis of mitochondrial sequences from each bird clearly segregates birds from each ethiopian population and the pirbright lines, and places the silkie and taiwanese chickens as having close maternal ancestry to the red junglefowl . the network  from a distance matrix of integration sites present in each bird is largely consistent with this phylogeny. the colours on the phylogeny relate to branch probabilities, whilst those on the network diagram relate to breed and line



integration sites indicate possible host-virus symbiotic advantage
functional annotation clustering of the  <dig> protein-coding genes  located within 5 kb of any of the  <dig> intervals, identify two clusters enriched for genes encoding proteins with cell adhesion properties and immune-related functions . the genes identified include cntn <dig> and cntn <dig>  which encode members of the immunoglobulin  superfamily, and tlr2- <dig> a member of the toll-like receptor  family which play a fundamental role mediating immune responses through pathogen recognition. the tlr <dig> genes have been found to be polymorphic among chicken breeds, and different haplotypes may therefore contribute towards differential pathogen responses  <cit> . also identified was robo <dig>  a member of the roundabout gene family best known for their role in the development of the nervous system  <cit> . polymorphisms in another member of this family, robo <dig>  have been linked to differential immune response to newcastle disease virus  in chickens  <cit> . it should be noted however that the integration site near robo <dig> was only present in a single chicken  from ethiopia.

average sequence coverage for the u <dig> region of the ltr was considerably higher for the intervals in proximity to the cdh <dig>  cntn <dig>  cntn <dig> and lrp <dig> genes  than for the fam172a, large, robo <dig> and tlr2- <dig> genes . the difference however was less extreme for the r  and u <dig>  regions . the u <dig> region of the ltr typically contains binding sites for cellular proteins that promote transcription initiation, and are capable of activating or enhancing the expression of nearby genes in a tissue-specific manner  <cit> . the conservation of the u <dig> sequence at some integration sites may be indicative of a possible selective advantage to the host. for instance if it were to confer superinfection resistance, through which cells prevent re-infection by a closely-related virus typically through a virus-encoded protein  <cit> . an example of such a mechanism is receptor-blocking by an endogenous viral env protein, preventing an invading virus binding to the receptor  <cit> . sequencing evidence  <cit>  suggests that the emergence of alv subgroup j was the product of recombination between an unknown exogenous alv and the env gene of eav-hp, although the expression of eav-hp env peptides was not found to confer resistance to alv-j  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
through the use of re-sequencing data, we have mapped eav-hp integration sites in a number of chickens of diverse origin. for this purpose, we have presented and validated a means of detecting eav-hp integration sites using paired-end ngs data. the sensitivity and precision of the approach was assessed using ngs data derived from the red junglefowl reference bird and comparing the results against the same genome. in addition, we have further demonstrated the reproducibility of our approach through the independent analysis of a single individual sequenced twice using independent libraries. a next step would be to validate a number of the intervals by conventional pcr, and ultimately to assess their impact on gene expression. although we have demonstrated the method using a single endogenous retrovirus, the same general principles should be applicable for any mobile element present in a host genome for which paired-end sequence data and a reference genome are available.

our aim was to assess how abundant eav-hp might be in the chicken genome in the context of recent evidence demonstrating it to regulate the expression of the oocyan phenotypes in some chicken populations. a large number of integrations were found in all chickens examined consistent with historical and ongoing circulation of the virus. a small number of intervals were found to be common in all of the chickens analysed, including the red junglefowl reference genome and we propose that these might represent pre-domestication integration events. the results of this study not only provide a platform from which to extend erv analysis across different retroviral genera in chicken using re-sequencing data, but also they reiterate the potential for erv integrations to play a significant role in host evolution, warranting further investigation of host-virus symbioses.
