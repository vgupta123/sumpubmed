BACKGROUND
marsupials and eutherians diverged between  <dig> and  <dig> million years ago  <cit>  and evolved very different reproductive strategies  <cit> . marsupials have an ultra-short gestation ranging from  <dig>  days for the stripe-faced dunnart   <cit>  to 38 days for the long-nosed potoroo   <cit>  and deliver an altricial young  <cit> .

organogenesis is completed after birth supported by a long and physiologically complex lactation, during which there is an increase in maternal mammary gland size and milk production, and there are dramatic changes in milk composition  <cit> . in contrast, eutherians have a long pregnancy during which maternal investment is high  <cit> . during eutherian lactation, milk composition remains relatively constant apart from the initial production of colostrum 24–36 hr postpartum   <cit> .

the tammar wallaby  has a  <dig> -day pregnancy after embryonic diapause  <cit> . after giving birth, the tammar produces milk for ~300 days until the young is weaned. phase  <dig> of lactation is comprised of mammary development during pregnancy and lactogenesis around parturition. at birth, the altricial young  attaches to one of the four teats  <cit> . lactation proceeds only in the sucked gland, whilst the remaining three glands regress  <cit> . the young remains permanently attached to the teat from the day of birth until day 100 pp  followed by detachment from the teat and a period of intermittent sucking while confined in the pouch between days 100–200 pp   <cit> . the final phase is from day  <dig> to at least day  <dig> when the young suckles variably and begins to graze as well as maintaining a milk intake   <cit> . these phases are highly correlated with changes in milk composition and mammary gland gene expression  <cit> . milk protein genes such as α-lactalbuminβ-lactoglobulin , α-caseinβ-casein and κ-casein are induced at parturition and expressed throughout lactation, whilst others are expressed and secreted in a phase-specific manner  <cit> . early lactation protein  is expressed during phase 2a only  <cit> , whey acidic protein  is phase 2b-specific  <cit>  and late lactation protein a and b are characteristic to late phase 2b/phase  <dig> and phase  <dig> respectively  <cit> .

the elp gene was first identified in an australian marsupial, the brushtail possum   <cit> . elp encodes a small precursor protein with a single bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor -kunitz domain characteristic to serine protease inhibitors. elp is secreted in milk in multiple isoforms, which include an ~8 kda peptide and a heavily n-glycosylated protein   <cit> . elp was later identified in the tammar  <cit> , the stripe-faced and fat-tailed dunnarts  and the south american grey short-tailed opossum   <cit>  . marsupial elp expression is limited to the early phase of lactation  <cit>  at the time the mother produces milk for an immunologically naïve young  <cit> . during this period, the tammar young is permanently attached to the teat and protected by humoral  immunity acquired from its mother’s milk and its own innate immunity  <cit> .

whilst an elp orthologue is yet to be identified in eutherians, tammar and possum elp share ~37% similarity with bovine colostrum trypsin inhibitor   <cit> . cti was discovered by chance in bovine colostrum over 60 years ago  <cit> . putative cti proteins with trypsin inhibitor activity were subsequently isolated from colostrum of the pig  <cit> , cat, sheep, goat, dog, reindeer, ferret and blue fox  <cit> , but were not found in equine colostrum  <cit> . these glycosylated proteins inhibited serine endopeptidases such as trypsin, pepsin and chymotrypsin  <cit> . however, of these putative cti proteins, only bovine cti has been sequenced  and found to contain a kunitz domain which generally indicates serine protease inhibitor activity   <cit> . laskowski and laskowski  <cit>  hypothesised that bovine cti protected immunoglobulins against proteolysis during the crucial period of immunoglobulin transfer from cow to calf via colostrum. however, its function is yet to be determined. although cti and elp are expressed in early milk, bovine cti secretion is brief   <cit> , but marsupial elp expression is prolonged   <cit> . however, their secretion in milk is correlated with the period of immuno-incompetence in the young  <cit> .

the kunitz domain was thought to have evolved over  <dig> million years ago  <cit>  and is now ubiquitous in mammals, reptiles, birds, plants, insects, nematodes, venoms from snakes, spiders, cone snails and sea anemones and in viruses and bacteria  <cit> . the archetypal protein of the kunitz domain and the bpti-kunitz family i <dig>  clan ib of serine endopeptidase inhibitors in the merops database  <cit>  is the much studied bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, also known as aprotinin . the kunitz domain is characterised by six conserved cysteine residues which form three disulphide bonds, producing a compact, globular protein of α + β folds  <cit> . serine endopeptidase inhibition occurs through the binding of the p <dig> reactive site residue within the ‘binding loop’ of the kunitz domain to a serine residue within the catalytic cleft of the protease  <cit> . this is a reversible, tight-binding, 1: <dig> interaction  <cit> . furthermore, the kunitz domain p <dig> residue determines protease-specificity  <cit> .

since its evolution, the kunitz domain has been incorporated into many different genes  <cit> . in general, each domain is encoded by a single exon  <cit> . some genes encode proteins with a single kunitz domain, e.g. elpctiptispleen trypsin inhibitor , the five trophoblast kunitz domain protein genes  and serine protease inhibitor kunitz-type- <dig>  and spint <dig>  these genes, apart from the tkdps, have  <dig> exons. the first exon encodes the signal- and pro-peptide, the second, a single kunitz domain and the third, a short c-terminus. however, the tkdps have a variable number of unique n domains inserted between the signal peptide and the kunitz domain-encoding exon  <cit> . genes that encode multiple kunitz domains include: hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor  <dig> and  <dig>  also known as spint <dig> and spint <dig> respectively , tissue factor pathway inhibitor  <dig> and  <dig> ; with up to  <dig> domains in the ac-kpi- <dig> i nematode  protein  <cit> . in addition, the kunitz domain has been integrated into multi-domain proteins, some of which include: the collagen α <dig>  α <dig> and α <dig> chains, wfdc <dig> and wfdc <dig>  amyloid beta a <dig> protein, α1-microglobulin/bikunin precursor , spinlw <dig>  and the wap, follistatin/kazal, immunoglobulin, kunitz and netrin domain containing  <dig> and  <dig> proteins  <cit> . furthermore, each domain within a multi-kunitz domain protein, may exhibit different protease activity, such as for the three tandemly repeated domains within both tissue factor pathway inhibitor  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> .

the early lactation/colostrum-specific expression of elp/cti suggests these kunitz domain-encoding genes may play an important role in the neonate. the sequencing of the tammar genome  <cit> , in addition to the availability of numerous vertebrate genomes including one other marsupial, the opossum, a monotreme, the platypus, many eutherians, birds , fish , amphibian  and reptile , provides an invaluable resource with which to investigate the evolution of these genes. we used a comparative genomics approach based upon bioinformatics and pcr-based cloning of cdna and genomic dna to characterise the marsupial elp and eutherian cti genes and investigate their evolutionary history.

RESULTS
elp/cti evolved from a common ancestral gene
to determine whether the marsupial elp gene was present in other species, we used multiple approaches. we cloned the elp genes of the koala and fat-tailed dunnart and isolated tammar elp from a genomic library. elp/cti transcripts were cloned from the mammary gland of the cow, opossum and fat-tailed dunnart and the dog cti transcript was cloned from epithelial cells isolated from canine colostrum. we performed blast searches of genomic databases , using a cut-off of e-value ≤ 1e- <dig>  and e-value ≤ 1e- <dig> . to further refine the identification of elp/cti orthologues based upon protein sequence, we also compared gene structures  to identify genes with a similar three-exon structure to elp/cti. based upon these methods, no genes orthologous to marsupial elp/eutherian cti were present in fish , birds , amphibian , reptile , monotreme , nor sea squirts, fruit fly, nematode  or yeast. however, many of the current genomes available provide only low sequence coverage . many assemblies are also incomplete  and may contain incorrect assemblies. hence it is possible that elp/cti orthologues may be identified within these genomes with future improvements in sequence coverage and assemblies.

the cti gene was present in the laurasiatherian orders cetartiodactyla  and carnivora . however, based upon current genome assemblies, it is a pseudogene in afrotheria, xenarthra, euarchontoglires and the laurasiatherian orders chiroptera and perissodactyla.

the mammalian elp/cti gene was composed of  <dig> exons and  <dig> introns . the marsupial elp gene ranged from ~ <dig>  kb for the koala to ~ <dig>  kb for the stripe faced dunnart, whilst eutherian elp spanned from ~ <dig>  kb for the panda to ~ <dig>  kb for the pig. elp exon  <dig> and  <dig> sizes respectively were highly conserved across all mammals . exon  <dig> encoded the putative signal peptide and the first four amino acids at the n-terminus of the protein. the 216 bp exon  <dig>  encoded the remainder of the n-terminal region, plus a single bpti-kunitz domain towards its 3'-end. elp/cti exon  <dig> differed most and encoded a maximum of seven amino acids. the elp/cti transcripts  were short. marsupial elp and eutherian cti transcripts ranged from 425–447 bp and 416–428 bp respectively and shared  <dig> %- <dig> % similarity at the nucleotide level . a highly conserved marsupial-specific region  was also identified within the elp 3'-utr .

based upon signal peptide analysis  <cit> , the putative elp/cti peptides identified in this study were predicted to be secreted in milk, as for tammar and possum elp and bovine cti  <cit> . the mature elp and cti peptides shared  <dig> %- <dig> % similarity . in addition, the conservation of the two kunitz domain motifs in all species suggested they may inhibit the s <dig> family of serine endopeptidases like many other members of the bpti-kunitz family  <cit> . the bpti kunitz  <dig> motif  indicates the  <dig> disulphide bonds which determine the structure of the domain . this motif spanned the entire  <dig> amino acid kunitz domain . the second shorter motif bpti kunitz  <dig> -x-c; where x represents any residue, those within square brackets are permitted, but those within curly brackets are not, prosite: ps00280] was located within bpti kunitz  <dig> . a putative trypsin interaction site within the kunitz domain   <cit> , is also depicted .

pairwise amino acids similarities were calculated using matgat  <dig>  .

conserved amino acid residues within a protein provide an indication of sites essential for its structure and biological function. comparison of the marsupial elp and eutherian cti precursor proteins showed that the signal peptide , the  <dig> aa bpti kunitz  <dig> motif , plus the shorter  <dig> aa bpti kunitz  <dig> motif within it  were conserved. however, the 20– <dig> residue linear chain of the mature elp/cti n-terminus had marsupial-specific and eutherian-specific homology . conservation of the short  c-terminus was variable . this was in part due to the use of different stop codons in elp/cti transcripts across divergent species. the opossum and dunnart elp proteins were truncated at the end of exon  <dig>  with the stop codon encoded by one nucleotide in exon  <dig> and two in exon  <dig> . for all other species, two different stop codons within exon  <dig> were used. for the panda, cat and dog, the taa stop codon  was used. however, for the pig, cow, dolphin and the remainder of the marsupials, the equivalent tga stop codon  was used.

surprisingly, there was little conservation of the amino acid residue type  at the p <dig> reactive site within the kunitz domain . although the p <dig> residue type  was conserved amongst eutherians: k  for the pig, cow and dolphin and r  for the cat, dog and panda, this was not so for marsupials. the opossum and possum elp p <dig> residue was acidic with a negatively charged side chain . however, the p <dig> residue for tammar  and the koala and dunnarts  was polar with uncharged side chains.

although p <dig> residues differed, all elp/cti peptides were predicted to be n-glycosylated at asparagine- <dig>  consistent for bovine cti  <cit>  and therefore should be larger than their predicted masses .

selective pressure acting upon marsupial elp and eutherian cti
the evolutionary selection pressure acting upon different regions of the protein-coding marsupial elp and eutherian cti transcripts was determined by dn/ds analysis . the dn/ds ratio measures the number of non-synonymous changes per non-synonymous site  compared to the number of synonymous changes per synonymous site   <cit> . a ratio of dn/ds =  <dig> suggests a neutral condition, with nucleotide changes accumulating in the absence of selection pressure, i.e. both dn and ds occur at the same rates. dn/ds <  <dig> indicates purifying selection, with amino acid changes not tolerated. in contrast, dn/ds >  <dig> is indicative of positive darwinian selection for amino acid changes  <cit> .

the protein-coding marsupial elp and eutherian cti transcripts and regions within them generally exhibited a trend towards purifying selection, with a dn/ds ratio < <dig> . however, based upon codon-based z-tests, only the eutherian cti bpti kunitz  <dig> motif  was found to be undergoing purifying selection . although the regions encoding the marsupial bpti kunitz  <dig> motif  and the marsupial and eutherian bpti kunitz  <dig> motifs  exhibited a strong trend towards purifying selection, the test values  were not significant. this tendency was also consistent for the putative trypsin interaction site. in contrast, three regions of the elp/cti transcripts showed a trend towards positive selection . these included the regions encoding the elp/cti n-terminus and the eutherian cti signal peptide. however, based upon codon-based z-tests , only the eutherian cti signal peptide  was undergoing positive selection.

marsupial elp and eutherian cti share common flanking genes
in order to confirm that the marsupial elp and eutherian cti genes were orthologous, we characterised the location and arrangement of elp/cti and its flanking genes. we used fluorescence in situ hybridisation to map tammar elp to chromosome 1q . the elp/cti gene was located on a syntenic segment in the marsupial  and eutherian genomes  <cit>  and was generally flanked by one or both of the single-copy genes phosphatidyl inositol glycan, class t  and wap four disulphide core domain  <dig> , confirming they were true orthologues .

the pigtwfdc <dig> region of bovine chromosome  <dig>  was unique. bovine cti was adjacent to pigt, but there was an insertion of ~602 kb between the cti and wfdc <dig> genes  <cit>  . this region included  <dig> artiodactyla-specific kunitz domain-encoding genes including ptisti, plus the five placenta-specific tkdp1-tkdp <dig> genes inclusive  <cit> . furthermore, the spinlw <dig> gene which contains both a kunitz and a wap domain and the eutherian-specific spint <dig> gene were located a further ~38 kb and ~90 kb respectively downstream from wfdc <dig> <cit>  . as mentioned previously, these genes, with the exception of spinlw <dig> and the tkdps, share a similar 3-exon structure. however, the tkdps differ due to the likely “exonisation” of an intron and its subsequent duplication to produce a variable number of tripartite n-domains between the exon encoding the signal peptide and the kunitz domain  <cit> .

cti has been lost in some eutherians
using the canine sequence as the basis for mvista comparative analysis  <cit> , the region between the pigt and wfdc <dig> genes was examined using the available genome assemblies - which have variable sequence coverage, contain gaps and may contain misassembled sequences. whilst the elp/cti gene was present in some mammals, it appeared to have become a disrupted pseudogene in others such as the african savanna elephant and human . exon  <dig> of the elephant and human cti genes  was present, but exon  <dig>  and exon  <dig>  were absent , suggesting they had been excised or transposed, whilst the horse and mouse cti genes initially appeared intact.

a closer examination of the nucleotide sequence between pigt and wfdc <dig> in these and other species using the ensembl and ucsc genome databases revealed that different mutations had most likely disrupted the cti gene. exon  <dig> was disrupted in the elephant, hoffmann's two-toed sloth , armadillo , human and other primates and horse, with exon  <dig>  also excised for these species, apart from the horse. additional file 5: figure s2a  depicts a nucleotide alignment of the functional/protein-coding dog cti exon  <dig> compared with the putative disrupted cti exon  <dig> of the elephant, sloth, human and horse. additional file 5: figure s2a  shows the translated sequences to highlight mutations and/or deletions within the signal peptide region of cti. the deletion of two nucleotides within human cti exon  <dig> would produce a frame-shift . cti exon  <dig> of the mouse, rat, large flying fox  and horse also appeared to have been disrupted by deletions resulting in frame-shifts when compared to the functional/protein-coding dog cti exon  <dig>  the disruption of the protein-coding region of equine cti exons  <dig> and  <dig> by at least one mutation and one deletion respectively would produce a frame-shift, suggested these were a recent occurrence ).

transposable elements within the elp/cti genes
transposable elements integrate randomly into the genome, so the probability of the same element integrating independently into orthologous positions in different species is extremely low. they therefore act as genetic markers and can be used to determine the phylogenetic relationship between genes and species  <cit> . further evidence that marsupial elp and eutherian cti evolved from a common ancestral gene was provided by censor retrotransposon analysis  <cit>  . retroelements of conserved fragment size and orientation were located within the pigtelp/cti region. however, the elephant and human which appear to have lost cti exons  <dig> and  <dig>  had also lost retrotransposons in the corresponding region, but gained a mer5a element.

bovine cti, pti, sti and the tkdps share a common ancestral gene
the location of the  <dig> kunitz-domain encoding genes  on bovine chromosome  <dig> between the pigt and wfdc <dig> genes and the artiodactyla-specific distribution of ptisti and tkdp1- <dig>  suggested they may have evolved from cti. this hypothesis was supported by phylogenetic analysis of the protein-coding regions of the mammalian elp/cti, bovine ptisti and tkdp1- <dig> transcripts, with bovine slpi used as an outgroup root . several different methods in phylip were used to determine the evolutionary relationships. these included the character-based maximum-likelihood  and maximum parsimony, as well as distance-based analysis . trees were evaluated using the bootstrap method . of the algorithms used, the maximum likelihood method using a molecular clock assumption, which assumes a constant evolutionary rate for all species, produced a tree with the highest bootstrap values. huttley and colleagues  <cit>  have shown that the eutherian nucleotide substitution rates are ~30% slower than for marsupials. however, all methods produced consensus trees which consistently separated the  <dig> sequences into the two groups depicted . the hypothesis that bovine cti was the ancestral gene for \bovine ptisti and tkdp1- <dig> was supported by both an alignment of precursor proteins and phylogenetic analysis of ctiptistitkdp1- <dig> and the spint <dig> protein-coding transcripts . interestingly, the size of the kunitz domain-encoding exon varied. whilst the bovine cti exon was 216 bp, those of the tkdps were 196 bp, with 192 bp for pti and sti and 175 bp for spint <dig>  furthermore, apart from cti and spint <dig>  none of the kunitz domains were predicted to be n-glycosylated. additional evidence of the evolutionary history of the ctiptisti and tkdp1- <dig> genes was provided by mvista  and censor analysis .

tammar elp expression is up-regulated at parturition and is mammary-specific
northern analysis showed that tammar elp was up-regulated at parturition, consistent with brushtail possum elp <cit>  . elp transcripts were detected in the tammar mammary gland from ~ day  <dig> of pregnancy onwards, throughout early lactation  until ~ day  <dig> of lactation. elp was then down-regulated to minimal levels for the remainder of lactation. this was consistent with a previous study of late phase 2a/phase 2b mammary tissues, but the precise timing of elp gene induction was not investigated  <cit> . neither elp, nor lgb was expressed in the virgin mammary gland and both genes were down-regulated postpartum in the non-sucked glands , as in the brushtail possum  <cit> .

lgb expression peaked in the mammary gland during phase  <dig>  consistent with  <cit> .

although cdna microarray analysis of the tammar mammary gland  was based upon comparative expression levels rather than actual transcript levels, the data was consistent with quantitative analysis of the northern blot  and microarray data reported by  <cit> . lastly, northern analysis of assorted tammar tissue samples indicated that expression of elp and lgb was mammary gland-specific , unlike the ubiquitously expressed cystatin c  gene .

discussion
elp was originally thought to be a marsupial-specific gene  <cit> . however, we have shown that the marsupial elp and eutherian cti genes evolved from a common therian ancestral gene . mammalian elp/cti was generally flanked by one or both of the single copy pigt and wfdc <dig> genes in a region that was syntenic to that of other mammals. the conserved genomic structure of  <dig> exons and  <dig> introns and homologous transposable element fragments confirmed that elp and cti were true orthologues. cti was also identified as the putative ancestral gene of the ruminant-specific ptisti and tkdp1- <dig> genes. based upon current genome sequencing and assemblies, elp/cti was not found in birds, fish, reptiles, nor amphibians, suggesting the gene was present in the therian ancestor before the divergence of marsupials and eutherians at least  <dig> million years ago  <cit> .

mammalian elp/cti and the evolution of bovine pti, sti and the tkdps
the kunitz-type inhibitor domain has been duplicated many times throughout evolutionary history  <cit> . this was no more evident than for the region of bovine chromosome  <dig> on which cti and the  <dig> cti-like genes were located. the ptisti and tkdp1- <dig> genes were specific to the order cetartiodactyla, sub-order ruminantia  <cit> , strong evidence they evolved from cti after the divergence of the ruminantia ~25- <dig> mya  <cit> . the ctipti and sti genes had a similar 3-exon structure and conserved regions within both coding and non-coding segments. the pti and sti genes and proteins were homologous and almost certainly arose by gene duplication  <cit> . however, the tkdp1- <dig> genes had one or more additional exons inserted between the signal- and pro-peptide-encoding and kunitz domain-encoding exons  resulting in an expansion to  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> exons   <cit> . these added exons encode tripartite n-domains which had no similarity to database sequences or motifs and evolved recently due to the “exonization” of an intron within an active mer retrotransposon and its subsequent duplication  <cit> . these elements have been associated with genetic rearrangements and deletions  <cit> . this may explain the excision of cti exons  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the elephant and primates, based upon current genome sequencing and assemblies.

lack of conservation of the elp/cti putative p <dig> reactive site residue
all putative elp/cti peptides were predicted to be secreted and shared a conserved single  <dig> amino acid kunitz domain. the conserved location of the  <dig> cysteine residues which form three disulphide bonds suggested elp/cti would, like bovine cti  <cit>  and pti  <cit>  form a globular protein. however, neither the identity, physiochemical properties of the elp/cti p <dig> reactive site residue, the trypsin interaction site, nor the n- and c-terminus of the proteins were conserved. the p <dig> “warhead” residue plays an essential role in the interaction of a kunitz inhibitor domain with a serine protease and a p <dig> mutation may alter the protease specificity of the kunitz domain to a particular substrate and the reaction kinetics  <cit> . kunitz inhibitors with a basic residue, k  or r  at p <dig> generally inhibit trypsin or trypsin-like serine endopeptidases such as chymotrypsin, pepsin, plasmin and kallikrein in vitro   <cit> . however, kunitz domains with smaller, uncharged residues at p <dig>  such as serine, generally inhibit elastase-like proteases   <cit> . in contrast, kunitz domains with an acidic, negatively-charged p <dig> residue  exhibit minimal antiprotease activity in vitro <cit> . comparison of bpti kunitz domains suggested that the marsupial elp p <dig> amino acids were quite rare  <cit> . furthermore, the absence of purifying selection within the putative elp/cti trypsin interaction site and the lack of conservation of p <dig> residues provides intriguing questions as to the role of the marsupial elp and eutherian cti proteins in vivo.

not all kunitz domains act as protease inhibitors  <cit> . as mentioned previously, snake and spider venoms contain proteins with kunitz domains  <cit> . some domains inhibit trypsin or chymotrypsin via p <dig>  whilst others lack anti-protease activity but have neurotoxic effects by acting as potassium channel blockers  <cit> . peigneur and colleagues  <cit>  recently reported a sea anemone kunitz domain protein, apektx <dig>  which had dual functions. it exhibited both trypsin-inhibitor activity and selectively blocked the kv <dig>  type of voltage-gated potassium channels. furthermore, not all kunitz protease inhibitors act via the p <dig> residue. the tick anticoagulant peptide  inhibits factor x, factor xa and thrombin but the reactive site is located towards the n-terminus of the protein, rather than at the p <dig> residue of the kunitz domain  <cit> .

elp/cti – a conserved n-glycosylation site predicted within the kunitz domain
all elp/cti proteins shared a putative conserved n-glycosylation site within the kunitz domain at asparagine- <dig> , consistent with the site identified for bovine cti in vitro <cit> . the proportion of sugars attached to glycosylated bovine cti, possum elp and tammar elp varies, 25-40%  <cit> , 60%  <cit>  and ~47-55%  <cit> , respectively. however, as the n-glycosylation site occurs at the base of the pear-shaped protein and at the opposite end to the p <dig> site, it is unlikely to affect protease-binding activity  <cit> . unlike bovine cti, the kunitz domains of neither bovine pti, sti, nor for the placenta-specific tkdps are predicted to be n-glycosylated. in fact, very few kunitz domains are n-glycosylated, or predicted to be so  <cit> . the exceptions are spint <dig>  spinlw <dig>  the first kunitz domains of bikunin and hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor, the second domain of tissue factor pathway inhibitor  <dig>  as well as selected sea anemone peptides. the precise effect of n-glycosylation is uncertain, but it may enhance protein hydrophilicity and solubility, reduce proteolysis, influence cell surface signalling and adhesion and affect protein folding, turnover and quality control  <cit> . furthermore, oligosaccharides may act as soluble receptor analogues for bacterial and viral pathogens, preventing them from attaching to the wall of the intestines, thereby stopping their passage through the gastrointestinal and urinary tracts of the young  <cit> .

the lack of conservation of the elp/cti n- and c-terminus was intriguing, particularly the positive darwinian selection  acting upon the coil-like marsupial elp n-terminus. in contrast, the eutherian cti n-terminus tended towards neutral selection. the n- and c-termini of proteins have been associated with sub-cellular targeting, protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions and macromolecular complex formation  <cit> . the marsupial- and eutherian-specific homology of the mature elp/cti n-terminus suggested these regions may have different activities. however, the lack of conservation of the elp/cti c-terminus suggested these areas may have species-specific effects. interestingly, the conservation of the tga codon used by the tammar, koala, pig, dolphin and cow for all species but the cat  suggested it was the ancestral elp/cti stop codon, with more recent mutations producing a shortened elp/cti c-terminus in some species. furthermore, a conserved marsupial-specific region within the 3' utr may regulate elp gene transcription.

elp/cti is expressed and secreted in milk during the early lactation/colostrogenesis period only . furthermore, all mammalian neonates have an innate immune system but an immature adaptive immune system and a gut which is yet to undergo maturation or ‘closure’ and is therefore permeable to macromolecules  <cit> . for the calf, gut maturation occurs 24–36 hr pp  <cit> , whereas for the tammar, this process does not occur until ~200 days pp  <cit> . therefore, maternal milk immunoglobulins such as igg can be passively transferred via colostrum and phase 2a/2b milk to the gut of the young calf and tammar, respectively, where they are absorbed by the intestines and enter the circulatory system  <cit> . hence elp/cti may enhance the survival of the young by preventing the proteolytic degradation of maternal immunoglobulins  <cit> , or by protecting the young against pathogens  <cit> . although sequence comparisons predict the elp/cti peptides are likely to inhibit serine endopeptidases, their true function will only be determined through in vitro and/or in vivo studies.

the importance of local control mechanisms in the regulation of the tammar mammary glands and elp were highlighted in this study. whilst elp expression proceeds in the sucked gland, the gene is down-regulated and milk production ceases in the non-sucked glands, as for the possum  <cit> . however, this partitioning of mammary glands and lactation does not occur in eutherians  <cit> . marsupial elp/eutherian cti expression was specific to the mammary gland and lactation , unlike the genes that most likely evolved from bovine cti. pti and sti are produced in mast cells, which have a protective role and are distributed throughout the body to tissues such as the duodenum, pancreas, lung, pituitary gland, spleen and chondrocytes  <cit> . in contrast, the five bovine tkdps are differentially expressed in trophoblast cells of the ruminant placenta only during the peri-implantation period, suggesting they have an important role in the maintenance of the conceptus and pregnancy  <cit> . hence, the bovine ptisti and tkdp1- <dig> genes have undergone positive  selection, changes in tissue-specific expression and function compared to the putative cti ancestral gene, consistent with gene duplication and neofunctionalisation  <cit> .

the location of the cti gene in a rapidly evolving region of the eutherian chromosome  <cit>  may explain the conversion of cti into a putative pseudogene in afrotheria , xenarthra , euarchontoglires  and in selected laurasiatherians such as the horse and flying fox.

this region included many additional genes with kunitz and wap 4-dsc domains  <cit> , unlike for marsupials. it is possible that the role of cti is fulfilled by one of these genes and hence the loss of the cti gene is tolerated. alternatively, cti function may have become non-essential due to physiological changes in selected species. notably, milk protein gene loss is not common amongst mammals, as genes involved in milk production are generally under negative selection  <cit> . however, the conservation of the elp/cti gene in marsupials and laurasiatherian orders carnivora  and cetartiodactyla  suggests elp/cti has an important role in these species.

CONCLUSIONS
marsupial elp and eutherian cti evolved from a common ancestral gene and encode a milk protein with a single bpti-kunitz serine protease inhibitor domain. although cti was identified as the putative ancestral gene of pti, sti and the placenta-specific trophoblast tkdp1- <dig> gene family, the origin of the elp/cti gene is inconclusive. elp/cti expression in the postpartum mammary gland is brief  in eutherians but prolonged in the tammar and other marsupials . however, this period correlates with the provision of milk to an immuno-incompetent young, suggesting elp/cti may play a vital role in immune protection of the young at this time.
