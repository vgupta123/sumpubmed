BACKGROUND
it is well known that cytotoxic factors, such as lipopolysaccharides, derange nitrogen metabolism in hepatocytes and nitric oxide  is involved among the other factors regulating this metabolic pathway  <cit> . no is a free radical that is involved in many cellular events. in the biological systems no has an halflife long lasting few seconds. it is an oxidation intermediate, therefore is both an oxidant and a reducing agent of metabolic products. its biosynthesis is mainly performed by converting l-arginine to l-citrulline. l-arginine analogues, such as ng-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester , act as false substrates and are selective inhibitors of no synthesis. no synthase  is either a constitutive or inducible enzyme. the endothelial isoform  and the neuronal isoform  are constitutive. the inducible form of the enzyme , has the main property to be not regulated by intracellular calcium concentration and ca2+-calmodulin complex, unlike the constitutive form  <cit> . it is known that inos is expressed by many cell types including macrophages, smooth muscle cells and hepatocytes  <cit> . hepatocytes have been shown to express large levels of no following exposure to endotoxins, such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide and/or cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor-Î± , interleukin- <dig>  <cit> . no may posses both cytoprotective and cytotoxic properties, depending on the amount and the isoform of nos by which it is produced  <cit> . no generally mediates beneficial responses, but becomes deleterious when coexistence with enhanced superoxide formation leads to the synthesis of peroxynitrite, a potent oxidant and nitrating agent  <cit> . according to this hypothesis, authors studied the effect of bradykinin, a proinflammatory mediator kinin, on cell viability and on urea production in cultures of rat hepatocytes. kinins exert numerous physiological and pathological actions; they partecipate in vascular and cellular events that accompany the inflammatory processes. in pathological states, kinins are thought to be implicated in inflammatory diseases and in haemorrhagic and endotoxic shock  <cit> . to demonstrate the decrease of cell viability and urea production by bradykinin, the authors studied its effects on no production. the measurements of no release from hepatocytes were investigated by using a no-specific fluorescence indicator,  <dig>  diaminofluorescein diacetate   <cit> .

RESULTS
effect of bradykinin treatment on no production
the amounts of released no were measured using daf-2da, that specifically reacts with the oxidized form of no, producing the fluorescent triazolofluorescein  <cit> . no determination was performed after  <dig> hours of incubation in the presence of bradykinin . as shown in figure  <dig> the treatment with  <dig>  mm bradykinin did not produce no increase compared to control, but  <dig>  mm bradykinin increased significantly the no release. in contrast no appreciable no release was observed during the same period in hepatocytes cultured with  <dig>  mm bradykinin and  <dig>  mm l-name.

effect of bradykinin treatment on urea production
to evaluate urea synthesis after bradykinin treatment, the hepatocytes were treated with  <dig> mm nh4cl for  <dig> h. figure  <dig> shows that only the treatment with  <dig>  mm bradykinin significantly decreased urea production and that the treatment with  <dig>  mm bradykinin and  <dig>  mm l-name did not produce a significant urea level decrease in comparison to control.

effect of bradykinin treatment on cell viability
to determine the effects of bradykinin on cell viability, the hepatocytes were exposed to bradykinin  for an incubation time of  <dig> hours. in one experimental series, the cell viability was determined by mtt test after  <dig> hours of incubation. in a second one, culture medium containing bradykinin was removed and replaced with the same fresh medium at  <dig> hours after the addition of bradykinin, and then cell viability was measured  <dig> hours after the end of bradykinin treatment. the mtt test after  <dig> hours of incubation does not indicate any significant viability difference in treated hepatocyte cultures in comparison to control . by mtt test after  <dig> h , a significant lowering of viability is observed in bradykinin  <dig>  mm treated hepatocytes in comparison to control. the decrease was significantly reduced by the simultaneous treatment with l-name  <dig>  mm even if always significantly lower than in control. cell viability was validated by trypan blue exclusion test .

discussion
the role of no as mediator of hepatic injury after endotoxic shock remains controversial  <cit> . increased no production in response to cytokines has been demonstrated in cultured hepatocytes  <cit> . laskin et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that the induction of acute endotoxemia, caused an increase in no production in the liver. this was associated with expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase  messenger m-rna in hepatocytes. also our data showed an increase of no production after  <dig> hours treatment of culture with  <dig>  mm bradykinin in an arginine supplemented medium, as substrate for the synthesis of no. the simultaneous treatment with l-name, a known inhibitor of nos, blocked the increase of no production. in this work we analyzed the urea synthesis after bradykinin treatment. urea synthesis was decreased after  <dig> hours treatment with bradykinin  <dig>  mm and the simultaneous treatment with l-name leaves urea biosynthesis unaltered. these data can be attributed to the control role of arginine in both urea and no biosynthesis. when no is synthesized from arginine, by the nos reaction, cytrulline, an intermediate of urea cycle, is produced. thus, the urea cycle is bypassed by the nos reaction  <cit> . whether no exerts cytotoxic or cytoprotective action remains unclear  <cit> . we also found a significant decrease of viability, at long term, in hepatocytes subjected to bradykinin treatment. the simultaneous treatment of hepatocytes with l-name improves cell viability even if control levels are not restored. the data show that the increased no production plays a role in liver damage induction, that follows the proinflammatory mediator treatment. the hepatocellular injury attributed to no may be due either to its direct cytotoxicity or its reaction with superoxide to produce the toxic nitrogen metabolite peroxynitrite  <cit> . oldenburg et al.  <cit> , demonstrated in other cell types, like cardiomyocytes, that bradykinin caused the increase in reactive oxygen species  generation. at last, our results show that the increased no synthesis induces a reduced urea production, that is an index of cell damage. the simultaneous treatment of liver cell cultures with l-name decreases no levels and sustains overall biosynthesis activities and cell viability.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we conclude that  <dig>  mm bradykinin treatment induces an increase of no levels and reduction of urea synthesis in the hepatocytes. this increased no production mediates, after  <dig> hours, cell toxicity as shown by mtt test. in contrast, the administration of the nos inhibitor l-name protects against cell damage and increases urea levels, suggesting that no plays a key role in the bradykinin-induced liver damage.
