BACKGROUND
floral nectar  is produced in many flowers to promote outcrossing mediated by pollinator visitation  <cit> . fn consists largely of sugars including sucrose, glucose, and fructose, regarded as rewards for animal pollinators. fn also contains several proteins, which are called nectarins  <cit> . although the presence of nectar proteins was first described nearly 80 years ago  <cit> , only a limited number of proteins have been identified and characterized. of these, many are likely not directly involved in attracting or repelling pollinators  <cit> , but rather function in sugar metabolism as well as in defense against microorganism proliferation, largely through the production of strong oxidants, such as hydrogen peroxide   <cit> . however, the over-accumulation of h2o <dig> produced by fn proteins has been shown to affect pollination behavior and reduces nectar removal by insect floral visitors  <cit> .

the best characterized proteins in fn are nectarins . five necs have been identified from an ornamental tobacco, nicotiana langsdorffii x nicotiana sanderae <cit> . the nec <dig>  protein was first classified as a germin-like protein  <cit> , and it was further characterized as manganese-containing superoxide dismutase involved in producing h2o <dig> <cit> . nec <dig>  a flavin-containing berberine bridge enzyme-like protein, possesses glucose oxidase activity catalyzing the oxidation of d-glucose to d-gluconic acid and h2o <dig> <cit> . high levels of h2o <dig> generated by nec <dig> and nec <dig> are closely associated with antimicrobial activity in the nectar  <cit> . consistent with their functional similarity, expression patterns of the nec <dig> and nec <dig> genes are also similar in the ornamental tobacco; both are highly expressed in nectary tissues just prior to anthesis  <cit> . the nec <dig> protein, which has high sequence similarity to the antioxidant storage protein, dioscorin, possesses both monodehydroascorbate reductase and carbonic anhydrase activities  <cit> , and contributes to the maintenance of ph and oxidative balance in the nectar.

other types of fn proteins have also been identified from diverse plant species. the flowers of leek  predominantly produces alliin lyase, which catalyzes the conversion of alliins to allicins, and a mannose-binding lectin  <cit> . a gdsl lipase was found in the fn of jacaranda minosifolia <cit> . this enzyme possesses lipolytic esterase activities and probably plays a role in the release of free fatty acids that may be involved in pollinator attraction. the gdsl lipase may also act against microbes by disrupting spore membrane integrity  <cit> . in addition, the antimicrobial proteins rnase, peroxidase, and endochitinase have been identified from the fn of petunia hybrida <cit> . thus, several fn proteins likely function in a complicated multipronged defense against microbes in this otherwise palatable solution offered to reward pollinators.

mass spectrometry has become a powerful analytical technique for protein identification in multicomponent samples spanning wide dynamic range of protein concentrations  <cit> . to decrease the complexity of the samples, proteins are separated by one- or two-dimensional  gel electrophoresis, visualized and digested with one of the proteolytic enzymes  to produce peptides. the extracted peptides are separated by nano hplc prior their injection into a tandem mass spectrometer where they undergo serial fragmentation by collision-induced dissociation  to generate product ion spectra for as many peptides as possible.

the peptides are usually identified using database searching that relies on the correlation of the acquired peptide masses along with the corresponding masses generated in-silico from available genomic, est, or protein sequence databases using dedicated software  <cit> . although protein identification based on stringent database searching is highly specific and accurate, its application is limited to organisms with available sequence information or to homologous proteins from closely related species. identification of protein families with poorly conserved domains, strong sequence polymorphisms, or from species phylogenetically distant from model organisms remains a major challenge for proteomic research. to increase the scope of studied organisms, an alternative strategy has been developed, that relies on de novo sequencing of the acquired ms/ms spectra followed by their searching using specialized sequence-similarity search engines in an error tolerant manner to identify peptides on the basis of their homology to peptides in the database  <cit> .

although some studies of nectar proteomes from non-model plants using similarity-based searching have been reported, there is no doubt that a genomic database of nectar-producing plants would greatly improve nectar protein identification  <cit> . in addition, the sequences of genes encoding nectar proteins enable an examination of the transcriptional regulation of these proteins. in this work, we conducted proteomic analysis using fn collected from nicotiana attenuata accessions across the plant’s native habitat, the great basin desert, utah. n. attenuata flowers produce a relatively large volume of nectar to attract two main pollinators: manduca sexta moths at night and hummingbirds in the morning  <cit> . we found natural variation in fn proteins among different n. attenuata accessions collected across the plant’s native habitat and identified fn proteins through stringent and homology-based database searching against public  and an in-house n. attenuata protein subdatabase.

RESULTS
variation of fn proteins among eleven n. attenuata accessions
we first characterized nectar volume and protein content in flowers of the n. attenuata utah accession , which was used to generate the 454-transcriptome database. secretion of fn was developmentally regulated: nectar volume increased gradually during flower opening . the amount of proteins also increased with floral development . we therefore analyzed fn produced at late stages of nectary development  in the subsequent assays. nectar volume of single flowers was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μl/flower . the total amount of proteins per flower determined by bradford assays was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg ml- <dig> .

to investigate the variation in nectar proteins among n. attenuata accessions, we collected the fn from  <dig> different accessions grown in a glasshouse and measured the fn volume and protein concentrations. the nectar volume was highly variable among accessions, ranging from  <dig> to 16 μl/flower . among them, the highway accession  accumulated by far the largest volume of nectar  compared with other accessions. the protein content also varied between  <dig> and 480 μg ml- <dig> among the accessions . interestingly, the protein content in fn of hw was significantly lower than other accessions. generally, there was a weak negative correlation  between nectar volume and protein content among accessions , suggesting that the total amount of proteins per flower are similar in n. attenuata accessions.

we next analyzed proteins in the fn collected from the  <dig> accessions by 1d gel electrophoresis . nectar proteins were mainly distributed between  <dig> and 60 kda. interestingly, a negative correlation was observed between the amounts of two highly accumulated proteins among the accessions, indicated by black  or gray  arrows : several accessions  produced abundant amounts of nanec <dig> but less of nanec1b. other accessions  which produced no detectable amounts of nanec <dig> produced abundant amounts of nanec1b. in terms of protein content and nectar volume, hw differed most from the “control” ut accession. we therefore chose ut and hw for further fn protein analyses.

identification of fn proteins in utah and highway accessions
to identify fn proteins in these two selected accessions of n. attenuata, we first separated fn proteins by 1d gel electrophoresis. each gel from the ut and hw accession was divided into  <dig> fractions and analyzed by lc-ms/ms . data analysis using stringent and similarity-based searching revealed that homologs of nec <dig> and nec <dig> proteins were enriched in fn of ut and hw, while the nec <dig> homolog was only enriched in fn of hw .

to increase the resolution of the analysis, we performed 2d gel electrophoresis of ut fn, which yielded  <dig> protein spots in the gel . most proteins ranged in molecular mass from  <dig> to 40 kda, consistent with the patterns observed in 1d gel electrophoresis. the most abundant proteins between  <dig> and 30 kda were homologs  of nec <dig> and germin-like proteins, and those between  <dig> and 37 kda were homologs  of nec <dig> and carbonic anhydrase . some abundant proteins below 25 kda remained unassigned by searching against the public database  . however, we were able to identify these proteins in ut and also in hw accessions by searching against the n. attenuata protein subdatabase. they corresponded to the nanec1b  transcript encoding a germin-like protein .

fn proteins of hw were mostly similar to those of ut, but several additional spots indicated by blue arrows were observed only in the hw accession . nanec <dig> proteins were detected only in hw fn as shown in the 1d gel analysis. the protein spot marked as ‵2′ was found only in hw fn and identified as a chitinase. another hw-specific protein spots below 20 kda  could not be identified using the public ncbinr database. searching against the n. attenuata subdatabase resulted in a lipid transfer protein <dig>  .

a number of other, heterogeneous proteins were also found in the fn of both accessions . these included pathogenesis-related  proteins , and defense-related proteins . proteins involved in sugar metabolism, such as xylosidase, glucosidases, and galactosidases, were also identified. in addition, we found a number of additional enzymes, including phosphatase, enolase, atp synthase, peptidase, phospholipase, and proteosome. the protein spots marked as ‵42′ in ut and marked as ‵17′, ‵18′ in hw corresponded to the na_454_ <dig> transcript encoding a dna primase where searching against an in-house database . these results demonstrate the diversity of the fn proteome.

however, an alternative hypothesis to explain the diversity of the fn proteome could be that fn was contaminated with proteins from other floral tissues during nectar collection. to test this possibility, we first examined the reproducibility of our method. in 1d gel electrophoresis analysis, we were able to identify low abundant proteins, such as calrecticulins, chitinases, galactosidase, glucosidase, rnase, annexin, and enolase . in addition, 2d gel electrophoresis of ut fn and hw fn were repeated three and two times, respectively, using independently collected nectars . the majority of the low abundant spots in ut fn  and hw fn  were detected in the second or third replicates . we also searched for fragments of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase  enzyme, which was found as a collection-related contamination of fn in our previous study  <cit> . no peptide fragment from rubisco proteins was detected in fn after modifying a collection method . these data suggest that most of proteins identified in this study were fn proteins and free from contamination. however, some spots marked as ‵12′ and‵40-42′ in ut  and as ‵2′ in hw  appeared only once amongst the replicates, suggesting that they could be minor contaminants from other floral tissues .

nec <dig> orthologs in n. attenuata
although the nec <dig> protein is a major player in the nectar redox cycle of an ornamental tobacco  <cit> , n. attenuata produced a relatively small amount of the nec <dig> ortholog nanec1a, which is almost identical to the ornamental tobacco nec <dig> . instead, other germin-like proteins nanec1b  were more abundant in ut fn compared to nanec1a . microarray expression data showed that the nectary-specific accumulation of nanec1a and nanec1b transcripts, but nanec1b transcript expressed more specifically than nanec1a in nectary . transcripts of an additional homologous gene, nanec1c, were abundant in the nectary , but its corresponding protein was not detected in fn from either accession. the signal peptide  <cit>  was predicted to be in the n-terminus of all three nanec <dig> isoforms, and c-terminal regions contained a superoxide dismutase domain, indicating functional conservation among the nanec <dig> isoforms .

in addition to the three nanec <dig> proteins, seven germin-like proteins were found in a transcriptome database , and their transcripts were found in various tissues . to establish the phylogenetic relationships among the  <dig> germin-like proteins and the nec <dig> of an ornamental tobacco, their amino acid sequences were analyzed using upgma  with the geneious software. the phylogenetic relationships were unrelated to the accumulation of each protein in fn. proteins encoded by nanec1c shared a high similarity with nanec1b, but nanec1c were not found in the fn of either accession although the nanec1c transcripts accumulated to a similar level as nanec1b transcripts in nectary .

nanec5s and lipid transfer proteins in n. attenuata
interestingly, some of the n. attenuata accessions contained nanec <dig> proteins in their fn, and some did not . while homologs of nec <dig> proteins were not detected in ut fn, three nec5-like transcripts  accumulated to high levels in ut nectaries . fn of hw contained two homologs of nec <dig> proteins, namely nanec5a and nanec5b, among three nec5-like proteins . nanec5c protein was not detected in hw fn.

similarly, the transcripts of two genes encoding a lipid transfer protein were highly abundant in ut nectary , but neither was detected in 2d gel electrophoresis image of ut fn . however, lipid transfer protein <dig> was identified in hw fn .

microarray analysis of n. attenuata transcriptome in nectaries
physiological and chemical properties of fn are determined by the nectary tissues, which are responsible for nectar production and secretion  <cit> . we used a custom transcriptomic microarray to explore the accumulation of putative transcripts encoding fn proteins in the nectary compared to other tissues including leaves, roots, stems, and corollas. we also identified nectary-expressed genes by cluster analysis , and 8% of total transcripts  showed nectary-enriched expression. among them we selected  <dig> transcripts, which passed the false-discovery rate threshold = 0% using the significance analysis of microarrays  algorithms in mulltiexperimental viewer software  <cit>  with significant  changes in accumulation between nectary and other plant tissues . to increase the resolution of the analysis, we collected early and late developmental stages of nectary tissues . among the  <dig> nectary-specific transcripts,  <dig> % of genes were preferentially expressed in early nectary development , and  <dig> % were elevated in late nectary development . transcripts of  <dig> % of the genes accumulated to high levels in both developmental stages. quantitative real-time pcr was conducted to validate microarray results , and the resulting data revealed an excellent correspondence of microarray and qpcr results.

most fn proteins are thought to play roles in the inhibition of microbial growth in sugar-rich nectar  <cit> . therefore, we were particularly interested in fn proteins involved in this process. several defense-related genes were highly accumulated in nectary . however, some defense proteins known to be accumulated in fn of other species  <cit>  were not detected in fn of n. attenuata by our analysis although their transcripts were abundant in the nectary. the transcripts of a floral defensin homolog  <cit>  were abundant in the nectary , but its protein was not detected in fn. in addition nectary-specific pr  and rnase  were not detected in fn . interestingly, the accumulation of several transcripts encoding fn proteins: glucosidase , xylosidase , galactosidase , chitinase , and annexin , were reduced in the nectary compared to leaf, root, stem, and corolla tissues . the data suggests that there is no strong correlation between transcript accumulation in nectary and its accumulation in fn.

we found a group of transcription factors  that were specifically expressed in nectary tissues. crabs claw plays a critical role in nectary development of a. thaliana <cit> , and transcripts of a putative ortholog in n. attenuata  were abundant in nectaries . yabby tf  and class iii hd-zip tf  also showed nectary-enriched accumulation patterns. additionally, we found five nectary-specific mads tfs which are putative homologs of seedstick tf involved in floral organ formation of arabidopsis   <cit> .

discussion
variations of fn proteins in n. attenuata accessions
in the nectar redox cycle proposed by thornburg and colleagues , nec <dig> and nec <dig> enzymes produce h2o <dig> in nectar, and both are highly expressed in an ornamental tobacco  <cit> . nanec1a and nanec1b proteins showed high sequence similarity to the ornamental tobacco nec <dig>  and was expressed in similar amounts per volume of nectar in the  <dig> accessions that we analyzed. interestingly, n. attenuata has two nec1-like proteins  in its fn, and accessions producing large amounts of nanec1b produce little or no nanec <dig> . nanec1b may serve the same function as nanec <dig> in hydrogen peroxide production in fn  <cit> .

the fn of the hw accession of n. attenuata additionally contained nanec5a and nanec5b, and a lipid transfer protein compared to the ut fn. interestingly, at least three nanec <dig> genes and two genes encoding lipid transfer proteins were highly expressed in ut nectary, but the proteins were not detected in the ut fn. the most likely explanation is natural variation due to recent mutation in the secretion mechanism for nanec <dig> and lipid transfer protein. however, we cannot rule out the possibility of translation inhibition of these genes in the ut nectary. an alternative hypothesis posed at the functional level of analysis to explain nanec <dig> expression in the ut nectary is that nanec <dig> may play an important role in nectary defense, not in the protection of fn.

nectaries of nicotiana species come into contact with the atmosphere and with precipitation, and contain both sugars and stomata, thus providing both food for pathogens and a means of entry into the plant  <cit> . nectary defense is essential for resistance against microbe infection of the entire plant. in this work, we found that transcripts of nectarins, prs, and defensins accumulated specifically in the nectary, but their proteins were not secreted to the fn, indicating that the nectary produces two groups of defense proteins: one for nectary defense, and another to provide axenic nectar.

nectary-specific transcriptome
the molecular mechanism regulating nectary development and nectar secretion still remains unclear  <cit> . few genes involved in these processes have been characterized so far: crabs claw tf in arabidopsis <cit>  and myb <dig> tf in tobacco  <cit>  regulate nectary maturation, and mutation of cell wall invertase  <dig> transcript in arabidopsis <cit>  alters nectar secretion. we were able to identify nectary-specific na_454_ <dig> and na_454_ <dig> transcripts, which are homologous genes of crabs claw and cell wall invertase  <dig>  respectively . in a previous study, silencing myb305-like genes in n. attenuata results in premature termination of flower development  <cit> . in addition, large-scale transcriptome analyses in arabidopsis <cit>  and brassica rapa <cit>  can identify nectary-enriched gene family. among them, lipid transfer protein and mate transporter family were also highly accumulated in n. attenuata nectary. these data suggest that molecular components involved in nectary development are well-conserved in nectar-producing plants.

putative functions of fn proteins in n. attenuata
the most abundant fn proteins of n. attenuata were nectarins, which have been found in an ornamental tobacco and play a role in the maintenance of high levels of hydrogen peroxide in fn. in addition, pr proteins , lipid transfer protein, and rnase were identified in the fn of n. attenuata. these proteins are also expected to help maintain an axenic fn environment which prevents microbial growth  <cit> , but their exact functions have not yet been examined under natural conditions. field experiments with plants silenced in the expression of or overexpressing putative nectar defense proteins would illuminate the roles of these putative nectar defense proteins and their impact on plants’ interactions with natural floral visitors. for instance, although increased peroxidase activity might better defend nectar against unwanted microorganisms, it would likely reduce pollinator visitation under natural conditions  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the identification of fn proteins and their transcripts is difficult, largely due to the lack of sequence information from nectar-producing plants. a major model plant, arabidopsis has nectary tissues producing nectar and valuable tools to dissect the molecular mechanisms in nectary development  <cit> , but the nectaries are miniscule and only secret nectar in trace amounts, which makes nectar collection and analysis a challenge  <cit> . this study clearly shows that transcriptome sequence information combined with advanced lc-ms/ms analysis of gel separated proteins from a suitable model plant can be used to precisely identify fn proteins. in addition, natural variation in n. attenuata suggests a complex role of fn proteins in plant-pollinator-microbe interactions.
