BACKGROUND
many terrestrial plants are covered with uni- or multi-cellular epidermal appendages called trichomes. plant trichomes frequently function as the first line of defense against biotic and abiotic stresses by space hindrance  <cit> . some plant species bear glandular trichomes that secrete a series of lipophilic substances and proteins, and are distinguished for their medicinal, culinary, fragrant and insecticidal properties. functional genomic approaches are now emerging as powerful tools that can accelerate our understanding of trichomes. significant progress has been made in cell differentiation and development research, particularly in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit>  and cotton  <cit> . however, limited information about metabolism and secretion can be obtained from these model plants as non-glandular trichome species, whereas several plant species can be more attractive in trichome metabolism research. mentha piperita glandular trichomes are specialized structures for monoterpene synthesis, which are the major compounds of and give the characteristic flavor to mint oil. its cdna library has been sequenced, and candidate genes putatively involved in essential oil metabolism were cloned and transformed for the purpose of genetic engineering of essential oil biosynthesis  <cit> . artemisia annual glandular trichomes synthesize and secrete the most important anti-malarial compound, artemisinin, an endoperoxide sesquiterpene lactone. its glandular trichome plasmid cdna library was established and randomly sequenced as starting material for dissecting isoprenoid biosynthesis  <cit> . furthermore, trichome gene expression profile analysis of other plant species, such as sweet basil  <cit> , alfalfa  <cit> , and hop  <cit> , has also been studied. according to the results, the characteristics of trichome gene expression differ in plant species, being closely related to morphology, structure, development and metabolism features.

tobacco trichomes are distinguished by their large size, high density, and superior secretory ability. they cover the entire plant throughout the whole development stage, and make the plant very sticky. there are two main types of glandular trichomes on tobacco leaves, short trichomes with a unicellular stalk and a multicellular head, and tall trichomes with a multicellular stalk possessing uni- or multi-cellular heads. cembrenoid diterpenes are one of the most important components of the exudates, which have wide-ranging biological activities including insect trail pheromones, neurotoxins, cytotoxins, anti-inflammatory and antimitotic activity  <cit> . in addition to their contribution to plant resistance, a positive effect of trichome exudates on leaf aroma and smoking flavor has also been proved  <cit> . however, in contrast to the broad knowledge on tobacco trichome morphology and chemistry, much less is known about gene expression of these special structures.

the initiative work on gene-mining from tobacco trichomes was reported in  <dig>  a trichome-specific p <dig> hydroxylase gene, cyp71d <dig> was cloned and functionally characterized. suppression of its expression by rnai changed the profile of the terpenoid spectrum of trichome exudates. transgenic plants showed enhanced resistance against aphids  <cit> . more recently, trichome cdna libraries of control and cadmium-treated plants have been randomly sequenced. antipathogenic t-phylloplanin-like protein, glutathione peroxidase, and several class of pathogensis-related protein  were expressed predominantly in cd-treated trichomes, indicating that the tobacco trichome is a metabolic active and stress-responsive organ  <cit> . genes expressed in tobacco trichomes during development, metabolism, and their protective function remain mostly unknown. to monitor the gene expression of tobacco trichome on a relatively large scale, we constructed a leaf trichome cdna library using the species n. tabacum l. cv. k <dig>  a widely grown cultivar in china. from over  <dig> high quality sequences, we obtained  <dig> unique ests. custom-designed cdna microarrays of these ests were used to analyze the gene expression of trichome. by probing the cdna microarrays with rna samples from trichomes and leaves-minus-trichomes,  <dig> upregulated genes in trichomes were identified, and were the foundation for further investigation.

RESULTS
leaf trichomes isolation and ests analysis
flourishing one-head-cell trichomes were found on the tobacco leaves surface when they emerged . when leaves were 40- <dig> cm long, the structural development was basically completed. most of the leaf trichomes at this stage were also well developed. there were 8- <dig> cells in the head of each trichome. cytoplasm of the head cells was much denser than that of the stalk cells . intensive red fluorescence was emitted from the head cells, showing high chlorophyll content . chloroplasts with perfect thylakoid structures and osmiophilic particles were also found in the head cells by ultra structural microscopy . these morphology features clearly showed that, at this stage, trichomes were biologically active and ideal for analysis of their gene expression.

a cdna library was constructed from leaf trichomes. the randomly selected individual clones were sequenced from the 5'-terminus. high-quality sequences of  <dig> clones were annotated and clustered into contigs, representing  <dig> unique genes. among them,  <dig> genes were singletons, indicating the low redundancy of the constructed library. a total of  <dig> genes were presented in multiple clones, ranging from low redundancy  through medium redundancy  to high redundancy . the largest contig in the database, showing sequence similarity to rubisco, had  <dig> ests . this finding is apparently in consistent with the morphology characteristic of trichomes.

among the  <dig>  unigenes,  <dig> %  has no reported homologs or showed homology to the genes coding for predicted proteins with unknown function  as analyzed by the blast program against analysis data from the non-redundant protein  database. the high percentage of unidentified genes suggests that tobacco leaf trichome is an interesting source for gene-mining. other  <dig> %  of the unique genes have defined functions . go categories of these  <dig> annotated genes are given in figure  <dig>  under the category of biological process, proteins encoded by  <dig> % ests were putatively involved in metabolic processes, the largest functional group among our est database. other groups were related to biological regulation , transport , stimulus response , signal transduction , developmental process , and growth , respectively .

within the metabolic category , the primary metabolism group  was predominantly represented.  <dig> photosynthesis related genes were also cloned, indicating the photosynthetic activity of chloroplasts in tobacco trichomes. secondary metabolism  accounted for ~3% of total metabolism-related sequences, which seemed much lower than in other plant species. go categories of stimulus response were shown in figure 2c. as expected, a significant number of genes related to abiotic stress, such as osmotic, temperature, light, water, wounding, and oxidation. besides, genes responding to chemicals, such as toxin, nutrient and hormone were also found, suggesting the complexity of biological regulation of tobacco trichomes. another large group was transport related-genes . some secretion related genes and intracellular transport genes were found. genes representing proteins for the transportation of ion, lipid, carbohydrate, protein and organic acid were also identified, supporting the secretory function of tobacco trichomes.

microarray analysis of trichome-expressed genes
the entire set of  <dig> trichome cdnas were amplified and spotted at high density on glass microscope slides . to identify the features of genes expression of leaf trichomes, microarray analysis was performed between trichomes and leaves-minus-trichomes. each glass slide held  <dig> copies of the entire array. to ensure the reliability of the results,  <dig> microarray slides  were used for each experiment. two independent rna preparations were made for each analysis, and labeling of the cdna  was reversed on the second slide. rna extracted from trichomes and leaves-minus-trichomes was used as probes to compare gene expression between the two organs. their correlation coefficient of the ratios was  <dig> , suggesting good reproducibility among individual arrays in the same experiment.

after correction for redundancy, the distribution of genes in various fold-change categories based on the ratio of expression of trichomes compared to leaves are shown in figure 3a. setting a 2-fold change in gene expression as the threshold,  <dig> % genes  had equal expression levels in the trichomes and leaves.  <dig> differentially expressed genes were identified, of which  <dig> were expressed more strongly in trichomes , while the other  <dig> genes showed lower expression. most of the high differentially expressed genes were  <dig> - <dig>  fold increased. there were  <dig> genes with > 30-fold increased in expression, the highest one increased  <dig> fold. these genes are worth to be followed in future study.

go function categories for differentially expressed genes between trichomes and leaves were compared. a total of  <dig> % of highly expressed genes and  <dig> % of low expressed genes of trichomes were annotated http://amigo.geneontology.org. the predicted gene sets for the high and the low expression were distributed among the biology processes categories . most of the differentially expressed genes between trichomes and leaves were metabolism-related.  <dig> genes encoding enzymes of secondary metabolic process, mainly terpenoid biosynthesis and phenylpropanoid, were highly expressed in trichomes. only  <dig> genes related to nicotinamide metabolism were highly expressed in leaves. in contrast, most of the primary metabolism-related genes were expressed much strongly in leaves than in trichomes, especially those relevant to carbohydrate and protein metabolism. comparatively, rna and dna metabolic processes were more active in trichomes.  <dig> photosynthesis-related genes, including light and dark responsive genes, were clearly elevated in leaves. highly expressed genes related to phytoalexin and resistant responses were predominantly expressed in trichomes. although the number of highly expressed genes with biological regulation functions in trichomes and leaves was almost the same, much more metabolic regulation genes were present in trichomes. very few genes encoding enzymes of development and signal transduction were found in the differentially expressed gene category. although transport-related genes were more highly expressed in leaves, secretion-related genes were predominant in trichomes.

the  <dig> most preferentially expressed genes in trichome, according to the microarray data, are shown in table  <dig>  including the  <dig> most highly expressed genes, 014d <dig>  and 003c <dig> , of unknown function. there were  <dig> genes, 002h <dig> , 021f <dig> , 070e <dig> , 002g <dig>  and 022g <dig> , functionally associated with stimulus responses. gene 002a <dig>  and 073a <dig>  were related to terpenoid biosynthesis and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, respectively. 057e <dig>  that encoded an enzyme homologous with caffeic acid-methyltransferase was relevant to cell wall metabolism  <cit> . 033b <dig>  that encoded an acyl-coa-reductase-like protein was thought to contribute to wax ester biosynthesis  <cit> . the other genes were related to protein metabolism, 001g <dig>  012g <dig> , and 013d <dig>  carbohydrate metabolism 023d <dig> , and iron binding 059e <dig> .

five genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis process, stress responses, and photosynthesis respectively were selected for semi-quantitative rt-pcr analysis to confirm their expression patterns in trichomes and leaves. pcr experiments were conducted on  <dig> rna pools derived from trichomes and leaves-minus-trichomes . the results demonstrated that all the  <dig> selected genes were clearly expressed in trichomes,  <dig> were highly expressed and  <dig> were weakly expressed, consistent with the microarray data. gene 002a <dig>   putatively encoded a protein homolog to tobacco terpenoid cyclase. 054f <dig>   was a homolog of the cytochrome p <dig> gene, cyp71d <dig>  involved in diterpenoid biosynthesis of tobacco trichomes  <cit> . both the two genes were expressed exclusively in trichomes. no amplified signals were found in leaves- minus-trichomes in the rt-pcr analysis. 004b <dig>  , putatively encoding t-phylloplanin-like protein, was also expressed specifically in tobacco trichomes. the other  <dig> selected genes, 001b <dig>  , homolog of the rubisco small chain, and 029b <dig>  , homolog of chloroplast pigment-binding protein cp <dig>  were prominently expressed in both leaves and trichomes.

discussion
although nicotiana tobacum may currently lack whole genome information as compared to other model plants, it provides a better platform for elucidating economically important secondary metabolites. previously, only limited genomic information on tobacco trichome is available in scattered databases. trichome http://www.planttrichome.org/trichomedb/ is an integrated genomic database of genes and metabolic pathway in plant trichomes  <cit> . it currently contains  <dig>  ests sequenced from  <dig> species, including nicotiana tobacum. in total  <dig>  tobacco unigenes from  <dig> est trichome libraries have been displayed. a blastx search against trichomeome showed that only  <dig>  of our unigenes had good blast hits . thus our cdna library sequencing of tobacco trichome had many transcripts that had not previously been detected. no microarray analysis of tobacco trichome is available in the public database at present, and the gene expression characteristics of tobacco trichomes seem far from being comprehensively understood. combining large-scale random sequencing with gene expression analysis has provided a unique and comprehensive overview of transcription related to key metabolic pathways in tobacco trichomes.

primary metabolism in tobacco trichomes
plant trichomes are special organs frequently functioning as plant defense. secondary metabolism is often supposed to be the most predominant metabolic process in trichomes. conversely in our analysis, tobacco trichomes were mostly involved in primary metabolic and photosynthetic activities. the largest contig in the tobacco trichome est library obtained is homologous to rubisco, an enzyme involved in the calvin cycle that catalyzes the first major step in carbon fixation. unigenes functional ontology analysis showed that genes related to primary metabolism and photosynthesis were among the most abundant categories in tobacco trichomes. several other reports made a similar discovery. comparative proteomics showed that rubisco was among the spots that were highly enriched in trichomes at the later stage in leave development  <cit> . sequencing of tobacco trichomes cdna library constructed from cadmium-treated leaves also proved that genes for photosynthesis and primary metabolism were detected with high frequency  <cit> . however, this discovery is quite different from that of other plant species, such as mentha piperita, in which photosynthesis-related genes are totally absent. secondary metabolism accounts for ~35% of total metabolism in the trichomes ests  <cit> . morphology and structure observation offer some support for this phenomenon. peppermint trichomes contain no chloroplasts, but leucoplasts  <cit> , while plenty of developed chloroplasts and apparently red chlorophyll fluorescence were readily observed in the head cells of tobacco trichomes. the structure of chloroplasts and the intensity of chlorophyll fluorescence in tobacco trichomes routinely changed with the leaf development stage  <cit> , and were also affected by environmental factors, such as drought  <cit>  and nutrient allocation  <cit> , implying that trichome chloroplasts are biological active and the regulation mechanism is very complicated. however, the precise role of the chloroplasts in the special glandular organ remains unknown.

we found the rubisco gene was relative weakly expressed in trichomes compared with leaves by both microarray and rt-pcr analysis. some other genes related to photosynthesis were also highly expressed in leaves. it is supposed that, at least, tobacco trichomes partially offer the energy and precursors for secondary substance synthesis and secretion processes by them. interestingly, the main secretion of peppermint and tobacco trichomes both belong to terpene family , but their mechanisms of biosynthesis may be totally different.

terpene metabolism
terpenes are the most abundant compounds synthesized in plant trichomes, and certainly the main focus in trichome metabolism research. volatile monoterpene and sesquiterpene are the main trichome secretions in most plant species. tobacco trichomes specifically synthesize and secrete diterpene  <cit> , non-volatile cembretriene-diols  contribute as high as ~60% of trichome exudate weight in n. tabacum, t.i.  <dig>  <cit> . thus tobacco trichomes are an important source of novel diterpene biosynthesis-related genes mining.

a group of genes involved in terpenoid metabolism were annotated during trichome cdna library sequencing, but fewer than expected. this was probably due to the primary metabolism-related genes being much more abundant and only limited clones were selected. other reasons may be the particularity of terpenoid metabolism in tobacco trichome, and the relative paucity of sequence information for the nicotiana genus in the public databases. although these genes accounted for a very low proportion of tobacco trichome ests, they all showed dramatically increased expression level compared to leaves. gene 002a <dig>  homology to a terpenoid cyclase was expressed  <dig> fold higher in trichomes than in leaves. no target fragment of this gene was amplified in leaves-minus-trichomes by rt-pcr analysis, indicating that it is expressed specifically in trichomes. since diterpenes are the only kind of terpenoids thought to be specially synthesized in trichomes, clone 002a <dig> is the most likely one involved in diterpenoid biosynthesis, and awaits further analysis. clone 054f <dig> is definitely diterpenoid biosynthesis-related. its sequence is homology to tobacco cytochrome p <dig> gene cyp71d <dig>  a cembratrieneol cyclase gene responsible for conversion cbt-ols to cbt-diols  <cit> . this gene also uniquely expressed in trichomes according to both microarray data and rt-pcr amplification. except for putatively diterpene biosynthesis-related genes, no other genes involved in terpenoid metabolism pathway were found in the trichome up regulated category. it is certain that diterpene metabolism occurs predominately and specifically in tobacco trichomes. recently several reports have focused on the cytosolic mevalonate  and the plastic methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate  pathways in plant trichomes. it is noteworthy that the mep pathway enzymes were more abundant in trichomes of artemisia. annua  <cit> , in which sesquiterpene metabolism dominates. these findings suggest that terpene metabolism in plant trichome is somehow different from the received theory that mva pathway is predominantly responsible for the generation of sesquiterpenes, whereas mep pathway is mainly for monoterpenes, diterpenes and tetraterpenes  <cit> . unfortunately, due to the relatively limited sequences available in the est library, analysis of the mva and mep pathways in tobacco trichomes seems extremely difficult, and will certainly be a focus of future analyses.

stress response
trichomes provide the first line of plant defense against biotic and abiotic stress. unsurprisingly, a lot of sequences in tobacco trichome est library were identified as stress-related genes based on their homology with the known sequences from arabidopsis, capsicum and other plant species. pr-proteins specifically induced by pathological or related situation form the main system of the biotic response  <cit> . two endochitinases, one belonging to group iv of tobacco pr protein , the other homologous to capsicum pr protein , expressed at dramatically higher levels in trichomes than in leaves . in addition, 022g <dig>  coding t-phylloplanin was enriched in trichomes by  <dig> fold. this surface-localized protein, synthesized only in the head cells of short glandular trichomes of tobacco, has provided a protein-based surface defense system against pathogens  <cit> . abiotic stress responses probably form another important defense function of trichome. a cluster of genes related to osmotic, temperature, light, mechanical wounding, and oxidative were annotated in the trichome est library. genes responding to chemicals, such as toxin, nutrients and hormones, were also abundant in trichome est library. some of them expressed at even higher levels in trichomes than in leaves. 008e <dig> and 049e <dig>  identified as heat responsive genes  had  <dig>  fold and  <dig>  fold higher levels in trichomes, respectively. 001e <dig>  putatively responsive to ethylene stimulus , was expressed  <dig>  fold higher in trichome. 009h <dig> , responsive to abscisic acid, and 063c <dig> , responsive to auxin were both more actively expressed in trichomes. as for epidermal structures, trichome cells seem to be more sensitive to environment factors than leaf cells. previous studies have indicated that nitrogen supply, water stress, mechanical wounding, light quality and intensity have significant effects on trichome development, metabolism, exudate content and chemical stability  <cit> . our results provide some molecular proofs of the interaction between trichomes and the environment. however, reports on trichome development and metabolism affected by plant hormone are not available. a comprehensive understanding of the effects of hormone on trichomes will help to find new ways of the regulation of chemical compounds in the leaf surface.

CONCLUSIONS
we analyzed gene expression in the leaf trichomes in n. tabacum using est sequencing and cdna microarray technologies. the overview of transcriptome of tobacco trichome was different from that of other plant species. primary metabolism-related genes accounted for larger proportion in the est library, while secondary metabolism and resistance-related genes were more highly expressed in trichomes than in leaves. genes identified as involved in the terpene metabolism and stress response might be good starting points of further functional investigations. a more comprehensive understanding of transcriptome features, and the identification of genes involved in important functions should pave the way for more precise regulation of metabolic process in plant trichomes.
