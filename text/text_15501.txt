BACKGROUND
defensins constitute a large family of small, cysteine-rich, cationic peptides that are capable of killing a broad spectrum of pathogens, including various bacteria, fungi, and certain enveloped viruses  <cit> . these peptides play a critical role in host defense and disease resistance by protecting the hosts against infections. transgenic mice expressing human enteric defensin hd <dig> are fully protected against the doses of salmonella typhimurium that are otherwise lethal to the wide-type mice  <cit> . conversely, mice deficient in the matrilysin gene, which is responsible for activating enteric defensins, become more susceptible to oral infection with s. typhimurium  <cit> .

defensins have been identified in species ranging from plants, insects to animals and humans  <cit> . characterized by the presence of 6– <dig> cysteine residues in relatively defined positions, all defensins are structurally related in that they form 3– <dig> intramolecular disulfide bonds and 2– <dig> antiparallel β-sheets with or without an α-helix. based on the spacing pattern of cysteines, these peptides are broadly divided into five groups; namely plant, invertebrate, α-, β-, and θ-defensins  <cit> . alignment of all known defensin sequences revealed the consensus defensin motif of each group as follows: plant defensin: c-x8–11-c-x3–5-c-x3-c-x9–12-c-x4–11-c-x1-c-x3-c; invertebrate defensin: c-x5–16-c-x3-c-x9–10-c-x4–7-c-x1-c; α-defensin: c-x1-c-x3–4-c-x9-c-x6–10-c-c; and β-defensin: c-x4–8-c-x3–5-c-x9–13-c-x4–7-c-c. the α- and β-defensins are unique to vertebrate animals with α-defensins only being found in rodents and primates, while β-defensins are present in all mammalian species investigated  <cit> . on the other hand, θ-defensins have only been found in certain primates as a result of posttranslational ligation of two α-defensin-like sequences  <cit> . a pseudogene for θ-defensin is also present in humans  <cit> .

analysis of human and mouse genomes indicated that β-defensins form 4– <dig> distinct clusters on different chromosomes with each cluster consisting of multiple defensin genes  <cit> . interestingly, the single mammalian α-defensin locus is located on a β-defensin cluster with θ-defensins residing in the center of α-defensins  <cit> . studies with mammalian defensins suggested a rapid duplication followed by positive selection and diversification within each group  <cit> . however, the evolutionary relationships among three groups of mammalian defensins and among plant, invertebrate, and mammalian defensins remain controversial. similarity in spatial structure and biological functions favors the notion that all mammalian defensins are evolutionarily related  <cit> , although a phylogenetic analysis suggested a closer relationship between β- and insect defensins than between α- and β-defensins  <cit> .

existence of a large number of expressed sequence tag  sequences and recent completion of chicken genome sequencing at a  <dig> × coverage  <cit>  provided a timely opportunity to discover a complete repertoire of defensin-related sequences in birds for studying the evolutionary relationship between invertebrate and mammalian defensins. here we report identification of a single β-defensin cluster that is composed of  <dig> genes located on the chicken chromosome 3q <dig> -q <dig> . evolutionary and comparative analyses of these chicken β-defensins with mammalian homologues strongly suggested that all mammalian defensins have evolved from a common β-defensin-like ancestor, which has undergone rapid duplication, positive diversifying selection, and chromosomal translocations, thereby giving rising to multiple gene clusters on different chromosomal regions.

RESULTS
discovery of novel chicken defensins
to identify novel defensin genes in the chicken, all five groups of known defensin-like peptide sequences from plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates were first queried individually against the translated chicken nonredundant , est, high throughput genomic sequence , and whole-genome shortgun sequence  databases in the genbank by using the tblastn program <cit> . all potential hits were then examined manually for the presence of the characteristic cysteine motifs. for every novel defensin identified, additional iterative blast searches were performed until no more novel sequences could be found. in addition to three known chicken β-defensins   <cit> , nine novel putative sequences, namely gal 4– <dig>  have been found in the est database with at least two hits for each, and such sequences have also been confirmed in genomic sequences . because of the fact that mammalian defensins tend to form clusters  <cit> , all chicken htgs and wgs sequences containing defensin sequences were also retrieved from genbank, translated into six open reading frames, and manually curated. as a result, an additional putative β-defensin, gal <dig>  was identified in several genomic clones . the open reading frame of gal <dig> was predicted by genscan  <cit>  and confirmed by directly sequencing of rt-pcr product amplified from chicken kidney.

 <dig> abbreviations: est, expressed sequence tag; htgs, high throughput genomic sequence; wgs, whole-genome shortgun sequence; e, exon;i, intron.  <dig> one est sequence entry is given only for the exemplary purpose. in each case, more than two independent est sequences have been found, except for gal <dig> and gal <dig>  both of which have no est sequences. gal <dig> was found through homology cloning  <cit> , and gal <dig> was predicted by us from the genomic sequence.  <dig> all gal genes are predicted to consist of four exons separated by three introns, except for gal <dig>  whose last two exons are fused together. the absence of additional sequence information at the 5'-untranslated regions of the cdna sequences prevented prediction of the sizes of first exon and intron for gal 3– <dig> and gal 9– <dig> genes.

no other sequence containing β-defensin-like six-cysteine motif has been found in nr, est or genomic databases, suggesting that  <dig> gal genes constitute the entire repertoire of the β-defensin family encoded in the chicken genome. although it is highly unlikely, we could not rule out the possibility that additional defensin-related genes with distant homology might be uncovered in the chicken by different computational search methods such as the use of hidden markov models  <cit> . it is noted that none of other groups of defensins have been discovered in the chicken, indicating that plant, invertebrate, α-, and θ-defensins are absent in the chicken lineage.

similar to gal 1– <dig>   <dig> novel β-defensins, deduced from either est or genomic sequences, vary from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acid residues in length. alignment of these peptides revealed a conservation of the signal sequence at the n-terminus and the characteristic six-cysteine defensin motif at the c-terminus . consistent with the fact that all β-defensins are a group of secreted molecules in response to infections, the signal sequences of all chicken defensins are hydrophobic and rich in leucines. in addition, the mature c-terminal sequences are all positively charged due to the presence of excess arginines and lysines. interestingly, gal <dig> contains two tandem, but highly divergent, copies of the six-cysteine motif at the c-terminus, and is the only defensin having such sequences. functional significance for existence of such two defensin motifs remains to be studied.

evolutionary analysis of vertebrate β-defensins
phylogenetic analysis of vertebrate β-defensins showed that chicken defensins clustered with various different groups of mammalian β-defensins . however, the bootstrap support for these patterns was very weak . the clustering of certain chicken β-defensins with mammalian homologues suggests that major subfamilies of β-defensins arose before the last common ancestor of birds and mammals, estimated to have occurred about  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . this in turn implies that some duplication of β-defensin genes must have taken place before the divergence of birds and mammals. the apparent lack of α-defensins in the chicken and other non-mammalian species  suggests that α-defensins may have evolved after mammals diverged from other vertebrates.

comparison of the numbers of synonymous and nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions provides a powerful test of the hypothesis that positive darwinian selection has acted to favor changes at the amino acid level  <cit> . this approach has previously been applied to both α- and β-defensins of mammals and has revealed positive selection acting on the mature defensin but not on other regions of the gene  <cit> . in the comparison of the chicken β-defensin sequences, synonymous sites were saturated with changes or nearly so, making it impossible to test the hypothesis of positive selection in every case. in pairwise comparisons among all sequences, mean ps in the propeptide region was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , while mean pn was  <dig>  ±  <dig> . in the mature defensin region, mean ps was  <dig>  ±  <dig> , while mean pn was  <dig>  ±  <dig> . mean pn in the mature defensin was significantly greater than that in the propeptide , indicating lesser functional constraint on the amino acid sequence of the former. the high mean ps shows that chicken β-defensin genes have not duplicated recently, unlike β-defensin genes of the bovine  <cit> . in the comparison between the most closely related pair of sequences , mean ps in the mature defensin was  <dig>  ±  <dig> , while mean pn was  <dig>  ±  <dig> . while these values are not significantly different at the 5% level, the fact that pn was higher than ps suggested that positive selection may have acted to diversify the mature defensin region between these two genes.

genomic organization and chromosomal localization of the chicken β-defensin gene cluster
searching through htgs database led to identification of two overlapping bacterial artificial chromosome  sequences, tam31-54i <dig>  and ch261-162o <dig> , both of which were sequenced and deposited earlier by one of us . alignment of these two sequences allowed to re-order three dna fragments in ac <dig> and to construct a continuous, gap-free genomic contig that includes  <dig> gal genes except for gal <dig> and gal <dig>  later search of chicken wgs sequences released on february  <dig>   <dig> confirmed the order of the genomic contig that we assembled and also revealed the locations of two remaining genes, gal <dig> and gal <dig>  both of which reside on a wgs  that overlaps with ac <dig> . the position and orientation of each gal gene were obtained by comparing its cdna with the assembled dna sequence. as shown in figure  <dig>  all  <dig> gal genes were clustered densely within a distance of  <dig>  kb on the genome. it was also confirmed by aligning such a contig with the chicken genome assembly, in which  <dig> gal genes are located on six wgs contigs  of chromosome  <dig> that are only ~ <dig>  mb from the distal end. consistent with this, the gal gene cluster was physically mapped to the tip of chicken chromosome  <dig> at the region of q <dig> -q <dig>  by fluorescence in situ hybridization  using the tam31-54i <dig> bac dna as probe .

comparing the cdna with genomic sequences also revealed the structure of each gal gene. unlike most mammalian β-defensin genes, which primarily consist of two exons and one intron, the gal genes were found to be composed of four short exons separated by three introns with variable lengths ranging from  <dig> bp to  <dig>  bp . gal <dig> is an exception, in which the last two exons have been fused together. while the first exon of the gal genes encodes 5'-untranslated region  and the majority of the last exon encodes 3'-utr as well as a few c-terminal amino acids, two internal exons resemble mammalian β-defensin genes in that one exon encodes the signal and pro-sequence and the other encodes the mature sequence with six-cysteine motif  <cit> . apparently, the first two and the last two exons of the gal genes have joined together during the evolution as a result of exon shuffling, which occurred in many other evolutionarily conserved gene families  <cit> , including invertebrate defensins  <cit> . the fusion of defensin exons in mammals is presumably adaptive because it allows a faster mobilization of such host defense molecules to better cope with invading microbes.

tissue expression patterns of chicken β-defensins
it has been shown that gal <dig> and gal <dig> are expressed in bone marrow and lung, while gal <dig> is more preferentially expressed in bone marrow, tongue, trachea, and bursa of fabricius  <cit> . to study the tissue expression patterns of novel gal genes that we identified, rt-pcr was performed with a panel of  <dig> different chicken tissues. similar to gal 1– <dig>  gal 4– <dig> are highly restricted to bone marrow cells with gal <dig> also expressed in tongue, trachea, lung, and brain at lower levels . by contrast, the six remaining genes, gal 8– <dig>  were not found in bone marrow, but instead in liver, kidney, testicle, ovary, and male and female reproductive tracts . these results clearly suggested that all chicken β-defensin genes can be divided into two subgroups. seven genes  are predominantly expressed in bone marrow and the respiratory tract, whereas the other six genes  are more restricted to liver and the urogenital tract. however, the functional significance and transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of these genes during inflammation and infection remain to be investigated.

comparative analysis of chicken and mammalian β-defensin gene clusters
to study the origin and evolution of mammalian defensins, a comparative analysis of β-defensin gene clusters in the chicken, mouse, and human was performed by employing additional, more phylogenetically conserved gene markers surrounding the defensin clusters. as shown in figure  <dig>  two genes, ctsb  and a human est sequence  immediately located centromeric to chicken defensins, were also found to be conserved in the defensin gene clusters on human chromosome 8p <dig> and mouse chromosome 14c <dig>  similarly, another gene, harl <dig>  that is 6-kb telemetric to gal <dig> is also conserved in another defensin cluster in human  or mouse  .

these results strongly suggested that all vertebrate β-defensins are evolved from a single gene. this conclusion is further supported by the fact that there are three highly similar β-defensin-like sequences present in the largely finished zebrafish genome . in addition, a group of homologous β-defensin-like sequences, namely crotamine and myotoxins, have been found in several crotalus snakes  <cit> , which are presumably derived from a single ancestral gene. the appearance of multiple β-defensin gene clusters on different chromosomal regions in mammalian species  <cit>  is apparently a result of rapid gene duplication, positive diversifying selection, and chromosomal translocation following divergence of mammals from other vertebrate lineages.

in addition to the structural conservation between β-defensin-like sequences in the rattlesnake and mammals  <cit> , a growing body of evidence suggests that their functions appear to be largely conserved in that both are capable of interacting negatively-charged lipid membranes followed by formation of ion channels or pores  <cit> . it is noteworthy that the conservation of cathepsin b  adjacent to β-defensins is perhaps not surprising, given the recent finding that cathepsins are involved in the cleavage and inactivation of β-defensins  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have showed that chicken genome encodes a total of  <dig> different β-defensin genes clustered densely within a 86-kb distance on the chromosome 3q <dig> -q <dig> , but with no α-defensin genes. these peptides exhibit homology to different subgroups of mammalian β-defensins-, consistent with the hypothesis that α-defensins and β-defensins arose by gene duplication after the divergence of birds and mammals. the θ-defensins are specific to primates; and thus appear to have arisen from α-defensins by gene duplication specific to the primate lineage. apparently, the evolution of defensins is rapid and driven by duplication and positive diversifying selection. collectively, this study represents the first large-scale detailed investigation of defensins in non-mammalian vertebrates. there is no doubt that further analysis of these defensin genes will lead to a better understanding of host defense mechanisms and evolution of innate immunity.
