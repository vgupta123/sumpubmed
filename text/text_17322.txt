BACKGROUND
achieving high levels of transgene expression is one of the challenges for applications of transgenic technology. in order to achieve this, researchers have focused on using several viral and plant promoters like camv 35s, mmv, fmv and rbcs
 <cit> . however, the expression of a gene is the outcome of the interplay of multiple processes including transcription, splicing, mrna transport, mrna stability, translation, protein stability and post translational modifications. thus gene expression can be regulated not only by modulating transcriptional parameters but also by using post-transcriptional parameters like using optimal codons or by including 5′ and 3′ leader sequences. a lot of research has been focused on the transcriptional control mechanisms like testing various promoters
 <cit> , developing synthetic promoters
 <cit>  and using enhancer domains
 <cit> . however, the importance of 5′utrs on gene expression has not been explored to its fullest potential.

most studies on 5′utrs have focused on elucidating the importance of viral leader sequences
 <cit> . for example, the  <dig> nt long 5′utr derived from the tobacco mosaic virus  rna, widely called as ‘Ω leader’ has been shown to enhance the translation of foreign gene transcripts both in vivo and in vitro. Ω, is also one of the most well studied leader sequences shown to enhance reporter gene expression in tobacco mesophyll protoplasts, xenopus laevis oocytes, e. coli <cit> , in rabbit reticulocytes, as well as in wheat germ extract
 <cit> . another viral leader sequence known to be a translational enhancer is that of the alfalfa mosaic virus rna <dig>  this leader when used as a 5′utr downstream to 35s promoter enhances gus activity by  <dig> fold in comparison to the pbi <dig> binary vector at a post-transcriptional level
 <cit> . apart from viral leader sequences, several plant 5′utrs have also been seen to enhance transgene expression. for example, the 5′utr of ntadh <cit> , sps <dig> <cit> , rbcl and atpb genes
 <cit>  demonstrate this capacity. however these have not yet been commercially exploited for transgene expression in plants. a synthetic 5′utr has also been tested in the binary vector pstart
 <cit> . in pstart, a  <dig> nt long synthetic stretch of dna, containing poly region, was incorporated as a 5′utr downstream to the 35s promoter, which showed improvement in transgene expression over that achieved by pbi <dig>  the designing was based on motifs present in the Ω leader sequence. this seems to be the only available report, wherein a synthetic 5′utr has been shown to enhance transgene expression.

in our study, we demonstrate the potential of a small  synthetic 5′utr, hitherto called as synj, to enhance transgene expression levels, which is at par or even higher than what could be achieved with the Ω and amv leader sequences in transgenic tobacco lines and in callus cultures of cotton. synj was designed as a multiple cloning site containing ecori, snai and ncoi restriction enzyme recognition sites for developing expression cassettes with the 35s promoter
 <cit> . the enhancing activity of synj was a serendipitous observation. the present study apart from analyzing the influence of synj also demonstrates that the 5′utrs are important for realizing the full potential of the promoter strength.

RESULTS
constructs and experimental outline
thirteen different constructs were developed in this study . these constructs have different expression cassettes cloned into the binary vector ppzp200n
 <cit> . each expression cassette carries a promoter  driving the reporter gene β-glucuronidase  or that encoding the green fluorescent protein  with a polyadenylation signal of the camv35s . the reporter gene also encodes for a 5′utr of the mrna which is the main variable in different expression cassettes. the combination of the promoter and the 5′utr has been called the ‘upstream regulatory module’ . the different constructs are named after the urm they carry. as eleven of the thirteen constructs have gus as the reporter gene, all constructs named without an extension indicate that the reporter gene is gus. the general features of the binary construct are presented in figure
 <dig>  while the sequences of different 5′utrs are summarized in table
 <dig> 

the region starts with the transcriptional start site  and ends immediately upstream to the atg .

the influence of the different urms on transgene expression was assessed initially in transformed cotton callus. several independent callus were developed for each experiment. in order to reduce the influence of the physiological status of the callus on the expression levels, the transformed callus with expression cassettes that were to be compared were developed and analyzed simultaneously. in several cases, the observation made in the cotton callus was also confirmed in different tissues of t <dig> tobacco transgenic lines.

experiments on cotton callus
in order to assess the influence of synj on transgene expression, gus activity was analyzed in several independent callus transformed with 35s and compared to that of 35s and 35s in two independent transformation experiments . in 35s and 35s, the gus gene is under the control of 35s  promoter from the cm <dig> strain of camv, which has been used in plant expression vectors of the prt series
 <cit> , whereas 35s carries the full length 35s promoter , as present in the binary vector pbi <dig>  the gus activity in case of 35s and 35s was in a similar range i.e.  <dig>  to  <dig>  pmolmu/min/μg protein; whereas in case of callus transformed with 35s, it was found to be much higher . in case of 35s, the gus expression cassette from the binary vector pbi <dig> was cloned into the vector ppzp200n as in the other two constructs. thus, gus activity, in the callus transformed with the original binary vector pbi <dig> was also recorded. the gus activity observed ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> pmolmu/min/μg protein which was similar to that of 35s. therefore, expression of the gus gene in the construct 35s was found to be ~ <dig> fold higher, based on mean values of gus activity  viz.,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for 35s,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for 35s and  <dig> ± <dig>  for 35s. this indicated a strong positive influence of synj on the expression of the gus gene.

further, we compared the influence of synj with two other widely used 5′utrs, Ω  and the amv leader, known to be translational enhancers
 <cit> . the gus activity  recorded in the callus transformed with the constructs 35s  as well as 35s  was lower than that of the callus transformed with 35s  . sixty percent of the callus transformed with 35s showed gus activity higher than  <dig> pmolmu/min/μg protein, whereas in case of the callus transformed with the constructs 35s and 35s most of the callus  showed gus activity lower than  <dig> pmolmu/min/μg protein.

to test whether the enhancing activity of synj could also be observed in conjunction with another promoter, we developed a new set of constructs with the promoter of the nopaline synthase  gene derived from agrobacterium tumefaciens. the promoter of the nos gene has been shown to have a  <dig> fold lower strength than that of the 35s promoter
 <cit> . a set of plant expression constructs nos, nos and nos were therefore developed and two independent transformation experiments were carried out. the gus activity observed in the callus transformed with nos construct was less than  <dig> pmolmu/min/μg protein, which was the lower limit of gus activity observed in case of both nos and nos transformed callus. further, ~90% of the callus transformed with nos, showed gus activity higher than  <dig> pmolmu/min/μg protein, which was the upper limit of gus activity for nos transformed callus . these observations indicated that the presence of the 5′utr nos, leads to higher expression than rt, but lower than what could be achieved with synj.

we further tested if the 5′utr of nos functions similarly under the 35s promoter and compared the influence of 5′utrs synj and nos on gus gene expression when controlled by the 35s promoter. the constructs 35s and 35s were used to develop transformed cotton callus in three independent experiments, the results of which are presented in figure
 <dig>  the presence of nos 5′utr resulted in a marked improvement in gus expression as compared to the constructs carrying either rt or pbi as 5′utrs . however, the expression observed with 35s was even higher wherein 30-40% of the callus showed gus activity more than  <dig> pmolmu/min/μg protein .

in order to study the influence of synj on the expression levels of another transgene , we developed two constructs 35s-gfp and 35s-gfp. gfp fluorescence was recorded using  <dig> μg of total protein. no gfp fluorescence could be recorded in case of the callus transformed with 35s; while fluorescence in the callus transformed with 35s-gfp, ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  f.u/ <dig> μg of total protein.

analysis of transgenic tobacco plants
in order to substantiate the results obtained from the cotton callus, we analyzed some of the constructs in tobacco transgenic plants. we developed a number of independent transgenic lines with the constructs 35s, 35s, 35s, 35s and 35s.

the gus activity recorded in the leaves of independent transgenic plants transformed with 35s, 35s and 35s has been represented in figure
 <dig>  while the distribution of gus activity observed in leaf, stem and root tissues of these plants have been summarized as a ‘box and whisker plot’ in figure
 <dig>  in each of these tissues, the gus activity observed in plants transformed with 35s and 35s was significantly lower than that with 35s.

further, the gus activity in different tissues of transgenic lines transformed with 35s was compared to that with lines transformed with 35s and 35s, as represented in figure
 <dig>  the influence of the three 5′utrs i.e. synj, Ω and amv, on gus expression varied in different tissues. in the case of the leaf , gus activity in 62% of the lines transformed with 35s was higher than  <dig> pmolmu/min/μg protein, while 47% and 27% of the lines transformed with 35s and 35s showed the same. in the case of the stem , it was found that in contrast to 35s wherein almost 47% of the lines showed gus activity higher than  <dig> pmolmu/min/μg protein, only 15% and 30% of the lines transformed with 35s and 35s respectively showed gus expression in that range. also, in the case of the roots , 94% of the lines transformed with 35s showed > <dig> pmolmu/min/μg protein, while only 53% and 42% of the transgenic lines transformed with 35s and 35s respectively, showed gus activity higher than  <dig> pmolmu/min/μg protein.

modification of synj and its influence on transgene expression
the  <dig> nt long synj  carries part of the near perfect translation initiation context  and an upstream region of  <dig> nt. a consensus tic for dicots
 <cit>  has a sequence of aaaaaaaaa/caauggc, wherein the initial a bases are less conserved. in order to analyze the role of these two regions and their influence on transgene expression, two mutant 5′utrs were developed . in synm,  <dig> bases  upstream to the ccatg were mutated to ttt, in order to break the consensus of tic, while in msynj,  <dig> nt upstream to the tic was changed. the modified 5′utrs were cloned as a part of the gus transcript under the control of 35s promoter. the expression of the gus gene in these constructs was analyzed in transformed callus of cotton . forty five percent of the callus transformed with 35s was observed to show gus activity >  <dig> pmolmu/min/μg protein.

expression in callus transformed with 35s was slightly higher than that obtained with 35s, which was, however, much lower than that of 35s. amongst the  <dig> callus transformed with 35s ~ <dig> % showed gus activity ranging between  <dig> to  <dig> pmolmu/min/μg protein whereas 50% of the callus showed gus activity lower than  <dig> pmolmu/min/μg protein. on the other hand,  <dig> % of the callus transformed with 35s, showed gus activity in the lower range.

to strengthen the above observations, the role of the two regions in synj was also analyzed in transgenic tobacco plants developed with the expression constructs 35s, 35s and 35s. the gus expression levels were recorded in different tissues of the transformed lines. the influence of the given three 5′utrs  on gus expression was tested in the leaves of transgenic lines, the results of which have been presented in table
 <dig>  in case of the leaf, gus activity in ~33% of the lines transformed with 35s was higher than  <dig> pmolmu/min/μg protein, while none of the transgenic lines developed with 35s and 35s, had gus activity in this range. in case of the stem, it was found that in contrast to 35s wherein almost 62% of the lines showed gus activity higher than  <dig> pmolmu/min/μg protein, only 25% of the lines transformed with 35s and none transformed with 35s showed gus expression >  <dig> pmolmu/min/μg protein. also, in case of the root, 81% of the lines transformed with 35s showed gus activity higher than  <dig> pmolmu/min/μg protein, whereas none of the transgenic lines developed either with 35s or 35s showed gus activity in this range.

synj enhances gene expression at a post transcriptional level
in order to check whether synj exerted its influence at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level, steady state levels of gus transcripts were measured by semi-quantitative rt-pcr of the rna obtained from the leaves of t <dig> transgenic lines developed with the constructs 35s and 35s. the level of gus transcripts was measured in each case after  <dig> cycles of pcr amplifications, which was observed to be in the exponential phase. the level of nptii transcript was also measured to normalize variations. no major difference in the intensity of transcript levels which could account for the observed differences in gus activity was seen between transgenic lines developed with the two constructs 35s and 35s , suggesting that synj enhances expression post-transcriptionally.

discussion
5′utrs are known to influence gene expression
 <cit> . when the coding region of a gene is cloned downstream to the transcriptional start site of the promoter in different cloning vectors, a 5′utr is inadvertently introduced, until and unless the 5′utr region of the transgene is an integral part of the expression cassette. such stretches exist in commercially available vectors like pbi121
 <cit>  which has been extensively used for comparing the strength of different promoters to that of the 35s
 <cit> . vectors like that of the prt series
 <cit>  are also used to incorporate transgenes downstream to 35s for developing transgenic plants. in developing such cassettes, different 5′utrs are introduced which can vary in length as well as sequence, depending on the particular vector and restriction enzyme used.

in the present study, we observed that the presence of the synthetic 5′utr, synj led to several fold increase in expression of reporter genes gus and gfp. the enhancement is observed when the expression is under the control of a strong viral promoter like the 35s as well as under a promoter like nos, which is reported to be ~ <dig> fold weaker than the 35s
 <cit> . the level of enhancement was variable among the different tissues analyzed, the maximum observed in roots, followed by callus, stems and leaves in case of tobacco transgenic plants. enhancement in cotton callus was similar to that observed in the case of the roots of transgenic tobacco. this enhancement is also evident when the present results were compared with the gus activities under 35s promoter recorded in previous studies .

*in these papers gus activity is expressed in different units. the value has been converted to pmolmu/min/µg protein for comparing it with the results of the present study.

the most widely used 5′utrs for enhancing transgene expression in dicotyledonous plants are the leader sequences of the tmv 
 <cit>  and amv
 <cit> . therefore, in the present study, we compared the influence of synj to that of amv and Ω leader sequences, which showed that the expression levels under 35s promoter observed in the leaves of transgenic tobacco plants with synj as a 5′utr, is equivalent to that observed with Ω and lower than that of the amv leader sequence. in case of the stem, the synj is equivalent to amv and stronger than Ω. however, in case of the roots of transgenic tobacco plants as well as in transformed cotton callus, synj showed much higher gus activity in comparison to both Ω and amv.

synj, probably influences transgene expression at the post-transcriptional level as our results with rt-pcr did not show any difference in transcript levels between the constructs with and without synj, which could account for the observed differences in gus activity. the widely known 5′utrs of the tmv and amv have also been shown to give high levels of transgene expression by improving the translation of the mrna. the Ω leader sequence carries a central poly stretch which has been shown to be critical for the associated enhancement in gene expression
 <cit> . further, it has been demonstrated that the hsp <dig> binds to this poly region and mediates binding of initiation factors eif <dig> and eif4g, thereby promoting translation initiation. however, based on our rna-emsa experiments, we did not observe any protein binding to the synj .

synj carries a near consensus sequence for translation initiation context  and an upstream region. a consensus tic ‘taaacaauggct’ was proposed by joshi
 <cit>  based on an analysis of  <dig> different plant genes and a consensus sequence ‘aaaa/caauggc’ in a later study
 <cit>  by analyzing  <dig> plant genes. in the present study the tic in synj was taaaccaugg. this does not carry a conserved a at − <dig> . papers on the functional significance of tic in plants, have given contradictory findings. while studies by luehrsen and walbot 
 <cit>  and lutcke et al. <cit>  showed that the aug context was not very important in plants, reports by guerineau et al. <cit>  and lukaszewicz et al. <cit>  demonstrated improvement in the levels of transgene expression but only by  <dig> to  <dig> fold. further, of the ~ <dig> papers, which have cited joshi′s work, wherein the consensus sequence for translation initiation was proposed
 <cit>  only a few papers have addressed the question of quantifying the influence of such a consensus sequence on the levels of gene expression. it seems that work to understand the role of a consensus tic has been limited in the case of plants, as compared to studies carried out on the importance of the kozak sequence in animal systems . studies by lutcke et al. <cit>  and luehrsen and walbot
 <cit>  suggested that an optimal tic might play a less significant role in plants than in animals. while luehrsen & walbot
 <cit>  used the maize transient assay system to carry out their study, lutcke et al. <cit>  compared the in vitro translation efficiency between the reticulocyte lysate and the wheat germ system, wherein enhancement in transgene expression was observed in the former case but not in the latter. the salient point emerging from the above studies was the proposal that an a at − <dig> and g at + <dig> were important in the tic, which was supported by the first two groups
 <cit> . however, a more recent study by agarwal et al. <cit>  demonstrates the functional significance of a tic on the expression levels of a modified synthetic human α1-proteinase inhibitor  gene under 35s promoter in transgenic tomato plants. the researchers documented that there was negligible expression when the consensus bases at positions − <dig> and + <dig> were mutated, while in case of mutation only at position − <dig>  there was a seven fold reduction in the expression levels.

the observations made in the present study, however, show that the influence of an optimum tic , seemed to be much more than what has been recorded in the literature reviewed. almost 50% of the enhancing effect of the 5′utr, synj was due to the presence of the optimum plant tic as the gus activity obtained with 35s with mutated tic was half than what was recorded in case of 35s in transformed cotton callus. this trend was also observed in different tissues i.e. leaves, stems and roots of tobacco transgenic plants, which substantiated the results obtained in cotton.

in the present study, the complete tic region, upstream to aug has been mutated, without changing the + <dig> base. the higher level of drop in expression observed in the present study could be due to the multiple changes that have been carried out rather than changes in one or two bases. although, not tested experimentally, if this is correct, then the whole sequence is important and not only the − <dig> and + <dig> bases, as proposed in the different studies. our observations also show that the fold enhancement observed with synj is not solely governed by an optimum tic as mutating the upstream region  also leads to a drop similar to that visible by mutating the tic .

that a proper 5′utr is important for realizing the full potential of a promoter is also highlighted in our observations. the 35s promoter has been suggested to be ~ <dig> fold stronger than the nos promoter when the transcript levels were analyzed
 <cit> . however, based on the gus activity, the difference was observed to be ~ <dig> fold. this variation in fold difference probably arises due to the presence of different 5′utrs in the two constructs. when the synthetic 5′utr of prt <dig> was part of the gus transcript, no major difference in activity was observed [compare gus activity of 35s and nos in table
 <dig> between the 35s and nos promoter. however, when nos or synj is the 5′utr of the gus transcript, 35s promoter shows ~ <dig> fold more activity as studied in cotton callus. this shows that the outcome of promoter strength can be greatly influenced by the 5′utr used, especially when the level of protein product is being used to report the strength of the promoter.

this led us to survey the literature where researchers have compared strengths of different promoters especially to the camv 35s. it turned out that in several reports
 <cit>  where promoter strengths were compared, the 5′utr used were different between the different promoter constructs which could have greatly influenced their conclusions. these reports probably indicate the functionality of a urm  rather than the promoter alone.

synj as a 5′utr of a transgene downstream to a promoter can be an alternative to using strong promoters or could also be used in conjunction with a strong promoter for achieving high levels of transgene expression. this strong influence of synj was also observed in another study carried out in the laboratory
 <cit> , wherein the gus activity observed with a truncated 35s promoter, containing only domain a of the wild-type 35s promoter was used. this study was not aimed at analyzing the influence of synj but was carried out to study trans-inactivation of synthetic domain a of 35s promoter by “tobacco  <dig> locus”. the presence of synj led to unexpectedly high levels of gus activity even when gus was under the control of only the domain a of the 35s promoter. the gus activity obtained with this truncated 35s promoter  was similar to what others have recorded with the wild type 35s promoter
 <cit> . 35s double enhancer promoter has been widely used to obtain high levels of gene expression as it yields ~ <dig> fold higher expression in comparison to the wild type 35s promoter
 <cit> . however, by employing synj as a 5′utr downstream to the 35s promoter, one can achieve even higher levels of protein product.

as the presence of synj as a 5′utr of transcripts of reporter genes like gus and gfp led to significant enhancement in the expression of transgenes in cotton callus as well as in different tissues of tobacco transgenic plants, we developed a set of cloning vectors pgen <dig>  pbgen <dig>  pbgen02-hpt and pbgen02-alsdm for cloning transgenes with synj as a part of its 5′utr which would be useful for those developing transgenic plants, needing high constitutive expression. the important features of these vectors are presented in additional file

CONCLUSIONS
the following conclusions can be drawn from this study:

 <dig>  the synthetic 5′utr, synj can efficiently enhance transgene expression under promoters like 35s and nos in dicotyledonous plants.

 <dig>  the enhancement obtained with synj is similar to that of viral leaders like Ω and amv. in the roots of tobacco transgenic plants, as well as in transformed cotton callus, synj was much more efficient than both Ω and amv. while in the stems, synj is equivalent to amv and much stronger than Ω. in the leaves, synj was equivalent to Ω, while being weaker than that of the amv leader sequence.

 <dig>  although synj carries a near consensus plant translation initiation context of  <dig> nt, the complete  <dig> nt is important for the observed enhancement.

 <dig>  the study also demonstrates the importance of 5′utr in realizing the maximal potential of a promoter.
