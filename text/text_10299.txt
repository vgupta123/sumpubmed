BACKGROUND
mammalian cell lines provide several advantages over other cellular systems for the production of recombinant proteins, most notably the correct processing and modification of mammalian proteins  <cit> . unfortunately, several mammalian cell lines undergo apoptotic death upon exposure to stresses originating from large scale cultures , severely limiting their productivity  <cit> . therefore, substantial efforts have been made in the past few years to devise strategies that reduce the loss of cell viability and increase the productive life of the cells. this includes 1) culture supplementation with limiting nutrients  <cit>  and 2) cellular engineering by transfecting cell lines with cdna molecules encoding anti-apoptotic proteins   <cit> .

recent efforts have also focused on the characterization of the stress-induced signaling pathways leading to changes in the cellular phenotype  <cit> . of particular interest is the identification of stress-related markers that would facilitate the optimization of mammalian cell culture processes. one such promising marker is gadd <dig>  a basic domain-leucine zipper  transcription factor of the c/ebp family  <cit> . a pro-apoptotic protein, gadd <dig> has been shown to be up-regulated by several stresses found in large scale cultures, such as amino acid or glucose starvation  <cit> , endoplasmic reticulum stress  <cit> , osmotic stress  <cit>  and hypoxia  <cit> . gadd <dig> mrna and protein levels are increased during the decline phase of ns <dig>  <cit>  and cho cultures  <cit> , and nutrient supplementation is sufficient to decrease gadd <dig> expression and improve cell survival in batch culture  <cit> . while its involvement in the induction of apoptosis in ns <dig> cultures has recently been disputed  <cit> , the tight regulation of gadd <dig> by culture-related stresses makes it a promising indicator of culture health.

the mouse hybridoma sp2/0-ag <dig>  cell line offers several advantages for studying the regulation of hybridoma cell viability. firstly, this cell line is acutely sensitive to culture-related stresses. in particular, sp2/ <dig> cells rapidly undergo apoptosis after  <dig> days of stationary batch culture due to l-glutamine depletion  <cit> . thus, the viability of sp2/ <dig> cells can be greatly improved by l-glutamine supplementation on culture day  <dig>  <cit> . secondly, sp2/ <dig> cells express low levels of the anti-apoptotic proteins bcl-xl and bcl- <dig>  <cit> . this makes this cell line readily amenable to cellular engineering experiments involving the ectopic expression of these anti-apoptotic proteins  <cit> .

in this report, we studied the regulation of gadd <dig> in wild type sp2/ <dig> cells and in sp2/ <dig> cells overexpressing bcl-xl. our results show that, while gadd <dig> is tightly regulated by l-glutamine in both cell lines, gadd <dig> protein levels remained low after l-glutamine supplementation, even as cell viability progressively decreased. furthermore, reducing gadd <dig> levels by l-glutamine supplementation in the bcl-xl-expressing cell line did not impact on cell viability. this indicates that the usefulness of gadd <dig> as a marker of the health of mammalian cell cultures is limited.

RESULTS
gadd <dig> is induced in declining sp2/ <dig> cultures
we first analyzed the regulation of gadd <dig> protein levels in sp2/ <dig> cells grown under stationary batch culture conditions. gadd <dig> expression was very low during the first  <dig> days of culture, which corresponded to the lag and exponential phases of cell growth . however, gadd <dig> protein levels increased sharply on culture day  <dig>  correlating with a precipitous decline in cell viability. these data indicate that, because of the acute increase in its expression in the declining phase of sp2/ <dig> cultures, gadd <dig> might be used as an indicator to monitor the health of growing sp2/ <dig> cells.

modulation of gadd <dig> expression by l-glutamine supplementation
for gadd <dig> to be useful to monitor the stress level of hybridoma cultures, its expression must be responsive to strategies that improve cell viability. therefore, we investigated the impact of l-glutamine supplementation on the expression of gadd <dig> in sp2/ <dig> stationary batch cultures. in agreement with our previous observations  <cit> , l-glutamine supplementation on culture day  <dig> markedly prolonged the viability of sp2/ <dig> cells, while the addition of pbs did not influence cell behavior . as expected, pbs supplementation did not prevent the increase in gadd <dig> mrna  or protein levels . however, supplementing the culture with l-glutamine on day  <dig> greatly reduced the induction of gadd <dig> both at the mrna  and protein levels  on culture day  <dig>  of note, the protein levels of gadd <dig> remained very low up to the end of the l-glutamine-supplemented culture on day  <dig>  even as the number of viable cells progressively decreased. for example, while the number of viable cells on day  <dig> in the control culture and on day  <dig> in the l-glutamine-supplemented sample is similar, gadd <dig> proteins levels are high in the former and very low in the latter . these data indicate that, while gadd <dig> expression correlates quite well with the health of the control sp2/ <dig> batch culture, its utility as a marker of cell stress is lost upon l-glutamine supplementation.

bcl-xl overexpression delays gadd <dig> induction in batch cultures of sp2/ <dig> cells
the viability of sp2/ <dig> cultures can also be improved by the ectopic expression of the anti-apoptotic protein bcl-xl  <cit> . we therefore tested the effect of bcl-xl expression on the induction of gadd <dig> in sp2/ <dig> batch cultures. western blot analysis revealed that the bcl-xl-transfected cells expressed much higher levels of the protein than the wild type or vector-transfected controls . in agreement with our previously published data  <cit> , the bcl-xl overexpressing cells grew at a slower rate than the control, and their viability was also extended . batch cultures of the vector-transfected control showed an increase in gadd <dig> protein levels that was indistinguishable from the wild type sp2/ <dig> cells . interestingly, the up-regulation of gadd <dig> was delayed by one day in the bcl-xl-transfected cells . as observed for the control cultures, the increased expression of gadd <dig> in the bcl-xl-sp2/ <dig> transfectants occurred as cell viability started to decline. therefore, gadd <dig> can be used to monitor the improvement of culture health attributable to ectopic bcl-xl expression in sp2/ <dig> hybridomas.

l-glutamine supplementation prevents the induction of gadd <dig> in bcl-xl-sp2/ <dig> cells in the absence of improvement in culture health
we next investigated the expression of gadd <dig> upon l-glutamine supplementation of bcl-xl-sp2/ <dig> cultures. l-glutamine supplementation on culture day  <dig> lead to a significant increase in cell viability for the ptej8-sp2/ <dig> control cell line . moreover, as observed for the wild type sp2/ <dig> cultures, l-glutamine addition severely blunted the increase in gadd <dig> protein levels seen in the pbs-treated control . on the other hand, and in agreement with our previous observations  <cit> , l-glutamine supplementation did not significantly increase cell viability in the bcl-xl-transfected cells compared to the pbs-treated sample . however, l-glutamine addition did blunt the induction of gadd <dig> protein in the bcl-xl-sp2/ <dig> cells, while the culture treated with pbs showed an up-regulation of gadd <dig> . therefore, significant differences in gadd <dig> levels were found in the l-glutamine- or pbs-treated bcl-xl-sp2/ <dig> cultures even though cell viability was not different. finally, and similar to our observations with the wild type sp2/ <dig> , gadd <dig> expression remained low in the l-glutamine-treated ptej8- and bcl-xl-transfected cells, even as the number of viable cells progressively decreased . thus, gadd <dig> protein levels do not necessarily correlate with viability in cells transfected with bcl-xl.

discussion
the optimization of mammalian cell culture processes would greatly benefit from the availability of a cellular marker that would 1) accurately reflect the health of the culture and 2) respond to strategies aimed at improving cell viability. because its expression is induced by several stresses encountered during the large scale culture of mammalian cells, the pro-apoptotic transcription factor gadd <dig> was recently proposed to be an indicator of apoptosis occurring in cell cultures  <cit> .

to validate the suitability of gadd <dig> as a stress marker for hybridomas, we studied its expression in sp2/ <dig> cells. even though it does not secrete immunoglobulins  <cit> , its high sensitivity to culture-related stresses and its low expression of the anti-apoptotic genes bcl- <dig> and bcl-xl make the sp2/ <dig> cell line a useful model for the study of optimization strategies aimed at improving cell viability. monitoring the expression of gadd <dig> in sp2/ <dig> cells grown under stationary batch culture conditions, we observed that both gadd <dig> protein and rna levels were markedly increased during the decline phase of the culture . this is in line with previous studies  <cit>  and confirm that, in batch culture, gadd <dig> expression inversely correlates with sp2/ <dig> cell viability. these data also suggest that approaches based on the use of the gadd <dig> promoter to induce the regulated expression of a gene of interest  <cit>  should be applicable to the sp2/ <dig> cell model.

we also examined the regulation of gadd <dig> under two conditions known to improve the behavior of the sp2/ <dig> cell line in batch culture: l-glutamine supplementation and the ectopic expression of bcl-xl. we observed that gadd <dig> mrna and protein levels were significantly decreased in sp2/ <dig> cultures supplemented with l-glutamine . a similar effect was also seen when bcl-xl-overexpressing sp2/ <dig> cultures were supplemented with l-glutamine . this response of gadd <dig> is not surprising, considering that gadd <dig> has been shown previously to be induced by amino acid starvation  <cit> , that l-glutamine is the major limiting nutrient in sp2/ <dig> cells grown in stationary batch cultures  <cit> , and that l-glutamine potently represses gadd <dig> expression  <cit> . thus, our results confirm those of lengwehasatit and dickson with the ns <dig> myeloma  <cit>  and murphy et al. in cho cells  <cit>  that gadd <dig> expression is responsive to nutrient supplementation in a cell line of biotechnological interest.

our data also revealed that the reduction in gadd <dig> protein expression upon l-glutamine-supplementation persisted for the rest of the culture period, even as cell viability continued to decrease. this indicates that supplementing the culture with l-glutamine at the peak of sp2/ <dig> cell viability is sufficient to override further increases in gadd <dig> protein levels, whatever the nature of the stresses leading to the loss of sp2/ <dig> cell viability. this phenomenon was not observed in other studies involving batch cultures because of the nature of the experimental design. effectively, while murphy et al.  <cit>  limited their analysis of gadd <dig> expression to  <dig> h after feeding, lengwehasatit and dickson  <cit>  did a more thorough analysis of gadd <dig> expression over several days of batch culture, but performed repeated nutrient supplementations during the culture period. thus, our data indicate that while the expression of gadd <dig> correlates well with the health of sp2/ <dig> cells in batch culture, it loses its utility as a stress marker upon supplementing the culture with l-glutamine. the cause of this lack of response of gadd <dig> to the declining health of the l-glutamine-supplemented sp2/ <dig> cell culture remains unknown. an interesting possibility is that other stresses, such as the accumulation of lactate or ammonia, which are known to contribute to the reduction in hybridoma cell viability in stationary batch culture, interfere with the modulation of the expression of gadd <dig> 

we extended our studies to the use of sp2/ <dig> cells engineered to express high levels of the anti-apoptotic protein bcl-xl. this manipulation was shown previously to significantly improve the behavior of sp2/ <dig> cells in batch culture  <cit> . interestingly, the ectopic expression of bcl-xl significantly prolonged sp2/ <dig> cell viability, which was accompanied by a delay in the increase in expression of gadd <dig>  however, l-glutamine-supplementation of the bcl-xl-sp2/ <dig> cultures lead to a sustained decrease in gadd <dig> protein expression in the absence of any benefit regarding cell viability. because engineering mammalian cells to ectopically express anti-apoptotic genes is a major strategy for the improvement of cell lines of biotechnological importance  <cit> , our results indicate that care should be taken when selecting gadd <dig> protein expression as an indicator of the improvement in cell viability achieved with these approaches.

CONCLUSIONS
the pro-apoptotic protein gadd <dig> is acutely up-regulated by several stresses encountered during the large scale culture of mammalian cells. as such, its use as an indicator of cell stress can facilitate the optimization of cell cultures. however, our data highlight important limitations to the use of gadd <dig> as a stress marker in mammalian batch cultures. whether these limitations will be encountered in other cell lines or when other feeding mixtures or culture optimization strategies are used remains to be determined.
