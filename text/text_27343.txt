BACKGROUND
guard cells  are specialised epidermal cells which form stomatal pores, through which gas exchange can occur. since transpiration is linked to plant growth and survival, control of gc number, distribution and activity is tightly regulated. mature gc pairs form in the epidermal cell layer and originate from a single undifferentiated protodermal cell . each pdc undergoes a series of cell divisions and successive cell-state transitions. these transitional states are characterized by changes in cell morphology and are associated with alterations in the transcriptomic signature . a subset of pdcs, termed meristemoid mother cells – mmcs –, become competent to initiate the stomatal cell lineage. the mmcs divide asymmetrically to produce a small triangular cell, the meristemoid, which serves as precursor of stomata guard cells and a larger cell referred to as the stomatal lineage ground cell . the slgc has the potential to directly differentiate into a lobed pavement cell or alternatively, to divide again asymmetrically to produce satellite meristemoids. all new meristemoids are oriented at least one cell away from an existing meristemoid according to the one-cell-spacing rule . after up to three rounds of amplifying divisions, meristemoids mature into guard mother cells  acquiring the distinct rounded shape. a gmc divides symmetrically to generate two paired guard cells, which form the stomata pore. the genes responsible for gc specification and development have been characterised: the bhlh-type transcription factors  speechless , mute, and fama act sequentially to regulate formation of meristemoids, gmcs and gcs, respectively . alongside the afore-mentioned genes, another class of bhlh–type tfs, scream/ice <dig> and scream <dig> redundantly affect the activities of spch, mute and fama through heterodimerization  <cit> . previous studies have shown that spch is required for cells to enter the stomatal cell lineage and to promote the amplifying divisions of the meristemoids  <cit> . experiments utilising spch promoter-reporter transcriptional fusions revealed that spch is expressed in the developing leaf epidermis and persists in gmc and gcs throughout the lineage. however, the spch protein has only been detected in undifferentiated pdcs, mmcs and in young meristemoids, suggesting that spch is regulated at the post-transcriptional level  <cit> . the activity of spch protein is negatively regulated by a signalling cascade, which includes secreted peptides epidermal patterning factors  <dig> and  <dig> , leucine-rich repeat  receptor-like kinases erecta and too many mouths  . the mitogen activated kinase  genes act downstream of the lrr receptors and include yoda, mkk4/mkk <dig> and mpk3/mpk <dig> . stimulation of mapk results in spch phosphorylation and inactivation by proteasomal degradation .

several signals converge to regulate the stability of spch protein, including the phytohormone brassinosteroid and co <dig>  <cit> . spch protein stabilization in protodermal cells is critical to trigger its transcriptional activity and consequent gc lineage entry. among the direct targets of spch is the epf <dig> gene which encodes a peptide that activates a regulatory feed back loop that promotes spch protein destabilization  <cit> . therefore modulation of spch activity translates multiple environmental and endogenous developmental signals into different gc patterns .

besides bhlhs, other transcription factors may play an important role in gc specification. the dna binding with one finger  proteins are an important class of transcriptional regulators in arabidopsis thaliana comprising  <dig> members  <cit> . these proteins have been shown to be involved in several aspects of plant development including growth, germination and abiotic stress response  <cit> . also, dof-type factors are implicated in cell cycle control  <cit> . in stomata development, dofs have been hypothesized to play a role in gc maturation . recently the dof transcription factor stomatal carpenter  <dig>  has been shown to directly regulate essential processes related to guard cell maturation and function. mutants of scap <dig> display altered levels of transcripts of multiple genes directly involved in stomatal movement and furthermore are defective in some mechanical properties of the gc cell wall  <cit> . the potential role of scap <dig> in stomata patterning has not previously been investigated. in this study we provide evidence that scap <dig> plays a key role in gc patterning, in a manner that is temporally and spatially distinct from its role in gc maturation. we observed scap <dig> expression throughout the leaf lamina at early developmental stages, when primordia consist of only undifferentiated cells. mutants of scap <dig> had significantly reduced stomatal density and stomatal index compared with wild type. conversely, over expression of scap <dig> resulted in increased stomatal density and stomatal index. furthermore scap <dig> expression temporarily overlapped with the expression of several other genes that regulate stomatal patterning, consistent with scap <dig> playing a role in stomata patterning. induction of scap <dig> activity using a glucocorticoid–based system resulted in repression of several early stomatal patterning genes including spch, mute and epf <dig>  and the ectopic production of gcs with altered spacing and morphology. in accordance with these phenotypes, detailed confocal microscopic analysis of marker lines on expanding leaf primordia revealed that high levels of scap <dig> correlated with an increase in the population of meristemoids as well as the number of undifferentiated pdcs. our work thus provides evidence for a novel role for scap <dig> in stomatal patterning

RESULTS
scap <dig> expression in leaf precedes gc specification
to further elucidate the role of scap <dig> in stomatal development we characterised a scap <dig> transposon insertion mutant publicly available in the cold spring harbour collection. this allele  carries a gene trap construct, which permits endogenous patterns of expression of the trapped gene to be visualised via gus staining. we characterised scap1- <dig> plants at different developmental stages and revealed two distinct patterns of gene expression during leaf development . at early developmental stages  gus staining was present throughout the emerging leaf primordia . at later developmental stages of primordia, levels of gus staining were highest at the flanks of the lamina and much reduced in the midvein region . in mature organs  the gus signal was mainly confined to maturing gcs . gc–specific scap <dig> expression was very faint in scap1- <dig> mutants compared with transgenic proscap1:gus-gfp lines  .fig.  <dig>

the scap1- <dig> mutant carries a gus reporter gene in antisense orientation with respect to the scap <dig> open reading frame . to verify that the gus pattern observed in the scap1- <dig> allele reflects endogenous scap <dig> promoter activity we fused a  <dig> base pairs genomic region upstream of the scap <dig> coding sequence to gus and gfp and generated independent arabidopsis stable transformants. these transgenic plants  displayed gus activity in young leaf primordia which was similar to that observed in scap1- <dig> plants . at later stages of development, the pattern of gus accumulation in the proscap1:gus-gfp lines was broadly similar with that observed in scap1- <dig>  coincident with the expansion of leaf primordia, gus staining gradually disappeared in the midvein region . in young leaf primordia, scap <dig> promoter activity appeared stronger in the proximal region of the leaf lamina. this observation was confirmed by analysing transverse sections of gus stained proscap1:gus-gfp plants. at early stages of primordium differentiation, the scap <dig> promoter was uniformly active in the mesophyll and the epidermis of leaf primordia . subsequently we observed a sharp proximodistal gradient of gus accumulation, with increased signal in the proximal part of the leaf primordium . scap <dig> expression was initially strong in gcs but tended to decrease in a distal to proximal gradient coincident with the maturation of gcs . these data reveal a previously undisclosed pattern of scap <dig> expression in early leaf development, which could suggest an additional role for scap <dig> alongside its already known function in gc maturation and function.

to gain insights in scap <dig> protein cellular localization we generated lines of arabidopsis overexpressing scap <dig> . the scap <dig> coding sequence was fused to the yellow fluorescent protein  gene under the control of the constitutive promoter camv35s . we anticipated that this construct would generate ectopic expression of scap <dig> throughout all plant tissues, however we were only able to observe yfp in a subset of plant tissues. the scap1-yfp protein–derived signal was absent in roots  whereas control plants overexpressing soluble yfp showed an ectopic signal in all tissues . we observed scap1-yfp accumulation in nuclei of mesophyll cells in young leaf primordia , while very little, if any scap1-yfp signal was observed in adjacent epidermal cells .fig.  <dig> scap <dig> protein differentially accumulates in plant tissues.  confocal images of pro35s:scap1-yfp  and, , pro35s:yfp  plants at different stages.  whole seedling.  first leaf primordia .  epidermis of the first leaf primordia .  gcs in a cotyledon .  epidermis of cotyledons . asterisks mark epidermal cells, arrows heads mark dividing cells. images a, b, f and g are the sum of all the z stacks obtained across the entire thickness of the sample. images c-e and h-i are the sum of those z stacks corresponding to the epidermis. bars = 1 mm ; 50 μm . scap1-yfp/yfp protein signal is shown in yellow, autofluorescence  in red.  cotyledon epidermis of gus stained proscap1:gus-gfp plants . bars = 100 μm



at later stages we observed scap1-yfp in gcs, which is consistent with the known function of scap <dig> in gc maturation . detailed analysis of the epidermal layer of pro35s:scap1-yfp cotyledons revealed low levels of nuclear scap1-yfp protein in dividing  epidermal cells adjacent to differentiated gcs . in summary, the expression of scap1-yfp appeared restricted to the sub-epidermal layer in early leaf primordia and only at later stages of leaf development the expression become visible in mature gcs and adjacent cells. the pattern of scap <dig> protein accumulation at later stages is similar to the domain where the scap <dig> promoter was transcriptionally active as shown by gus staining of cotyledons of proscap1:gus-gfp plants . we conclude that the scap <dig> protein is subject to a strong post-transcriptional regulation and that the site of scap <dig> protein accumulation only partially overlaps with the pattern of scap <dig> gene expression.

scap <dig> regulates gc development
the scap1- <dig> allele was likely a null since it did not produce any detectable full-length scap <dig> transcript . to further investigate the role of scap <dig> in stomatal development we compared the number of gcs in adult leaves of scap1- <dig> mutants with that of wild type . in scap1- <dig> stomatal density is reduced  but this was not reflected in a reduction of stomatal index since scap1- <dig> plants also have a significant reduction in pavement cells compared to wild type . to confirm these observations we generated two independent artificial microrna  constructs specifically targeting scap <dig> in wild type . we isolated sixteen and fourteen independent t <dig> lines for amirna1-scap <dig> and amirna2-scap <dig>  respectively and confirmed that t <dig> lines had reduced levels of scap <dig> transcript compared to wild type . downregulation of scap <dig> did not produce any obvious phenotypic effects on overall plant morphology, similar to scap1- <dig> plants. closer observations revealed that leaves of segregating t <dig> amirna-scap <dig> knock-down independent lines produced significantly fewer gcs than wild type . in homozygous t <dig> amirna-scap <dig> lines we observed a general reduction in cell density, analogous to the result observed in scap1- <dig>  and also a reduction in stomatal index. taken together these results suggest that scap <dig> plays a role in gcs specification in addition to its role in cell division .fig.  <dig>

to determine whether overexpression of scap <dig> is sufficient to alter gc development we analysed the phenotypes of the aforementioned pro35s:scap1-yfp lines. we observed t <dig> individuals with altered phenotypes ranging in severity from strong to mild . plants classified as strong over-expressors of scap <dig>  exhibited numerous developmental defects including reduced germination, slow and stunted growth, upward-curling leaves and sterility. a second phenotypic class  displayed a less severe phenotype, exhibiting reduced growth compared to wild type at the seedling stage. in transgenic lines with intermediate phenotype, defects appeared to recover at later stages of development so that these lines were eventually comparable in final size and leaf area to wild type. given the strong phenotypic abnormalities in strong scap1-yfp overexpressing lines, we carried out our analyses on intermediate lines, which are more comparable to wild type in terms of plant morphology. lines with intermediate levels of pro35s:scap1-yfp had an increased number of both gcs and pcs in true leaves compared to wild type and this was accompanied by an overall increase in stomatal index . the epidermal phenotype of pro35s:scap1-yfp plants was characterised in more detail by crossing to a gc–specific reporter line carrying proatmyb60:gus  <cit>  which allowed us to detect subtler gc patterning defects. the cotyledons of pro35s:scap1-yfp showed gross alterations in stomata spacing as shown by the presence of massive clusters of gcs which were located at the edges of the cotyledon, especially on the adaxial surface . interestingly, no clusters of gcs were detectable in true leaves of pro35s:scap1-yfp plants. furthermore, based on gus detection, over expression of scap <dig> did not confer guard cell identity to every cell type, nor was it able to induce stomata production in the cotyledon mesophyll cells . thus, scap <dig> also plays an important role in determining gc spacing, at least in cotyledons.

to confirm these observations we generated a second gain-of-function allele of scap <dig> in which constitutively expressed scap <dig> is fused to the glucocorticoid receptor   <cit> . in this inducible system the fusion protein is normally localised in the cytosol but can shuttle to the nucleus upon application of dexamethasone  to trigger a rapid scap1-dependent transcriptional activation  <cit> . prior to induction, plants of pro35s:scap1-gr were phenotypically indistinguishable from the wild type , despite accumulating high levels of scap1-gr transcript . pro35s:scap1-gr seeds did not germinate on media supplemented with dex, suggesting high levels of scap <dig> could inhibit germination. therefore we grew pro35s:scap1-gr seeds on dex–free media and transferred seedlings 5 days after sowing on media supplemented with dex or a mock solution. twenty days following transfer to dex pro35s:scap1-gr plants produced similar morphological alterations previously observed in strong pro35s:scap1-yfp transgenic plants . in contrast, dex treatment had no significant morphological effects in control plants .fig.  <dig>

to further investigate the epidermal phenotype of scap1–gr plants we analysed the pattern of gus distribution in pro35s:scap1-gr proatmyb60:gus double hemizygous plants. microscopic analysis of untreated pro35s:scap1-gr proatmyb60:gus plants revealed gcs cluster in both cotyledons and leaves although these clusters were generally made of few gcs . also, pro35s:scap1-gr proatmyb60:gus plants frequently presented unpaired gcs as well as clusters of meristemoid cells adjacent to gcs . dex treated pro35s:scap1-gr proatmyb60:gus plants, showed an even stronger phenotype in stomata patterning compared with the untreated control as we observed an overproduction of gcs in true leaves, which were grouped in extensive clusters . also in this case, gus detection revealed that clusters were frequently made of unpaired gcs .

to identify whether the altered stomata patterning of pro35s:scap1-gr could depend on increased number of cells entering the stomatal lineage we generated double hemizygous promute:mute-yfp pro35s:scap1-gr plants which allowed us to visualise meristemoid cells. even in the absence of dex, at the later stages of primordium development pro35s:scap1-gr promute:mute-yfp plants displayed an increased number of meristemoids compared to control hemizygous promute:mute-yfp plants . a closer inspection of the epidermis revealed that in pro35s:scap1-gr promute:mute-yfp meristemoid cells often did not follow the correct spacing and were close to each other . taken together scap <dig> appears to regulate different aspects of stomata development, including stomata number, distribution and spacing.

effects of scap <dig> on stomatal patterning gene expression
the early activation of scap <dig> in leaf primordia coupled with its role in stomata development led us to hypothesise a genetic interaction between scap <dig> and genes that regulate stomatal patterning. two genes, spch and epf <dig> that are required for early stomatal patterning are expressed in the protodermal cells of leaf primordia. to determine the timing of scap <dig> activation with respect to stomata early patterning genes we sampled primordia of leaves one and two from seedlings at different time points, representative of different stages of leaf development. transcript abundance of scap <dig>  spch and epf <dig> peaked at 7 days after sowing and subsequently decreased during the next 3 days . at around 12 days after sowing, scap <dig> expression levels reactivated, presumably in relation to gc formation in the maturing leaf . to test if scap <dig> expression is dependent on spch, we crossed scap1- <dig>  with spch- <dig>  mutants to obtain homozygous spch mutants carrying a transposon tagged version of scap <dig>  of  <dig> spch homozygous plants, two displayed gus staining that was similar in terms of pattern of expression to wild type spch plants. the reduced frequency of this genotype could be due to genetic linkage since spch and scap <dig> are physically close on chromosome  <dig>  spch is thus not required for the early scap <dig> activation , consistent with previous studies indicating that scap <dig> was not a high-confidence spch target  <cit> .fig.  <dig> role of scap <dig> on stomatal genes transcript accumulations.  pattern of scap <dig>  spch and epf <dig> transcript accumulations determined by quantitative pcr in manually dissected first two leaf primordia of wild type  seedlings at different days after sowing. values represent the mean of three biological replicates .  gus staining of scap1- <dig> in wild type or spch- <dig> mutant background in 5 day old seedlings. bar = 100 μm.  pattern of scap <dig>  spch, epf <dig>  mute and fama transcript accumulations determined by quantitative pcr in manually dissected first two leaf primordia of 7 days-old wild type , pro35s:amirna2-scap <dig>  and pro35s:scap1-yfp  plants. values represent the mean of three biological replicates .  pattern of atmyb <dig>  spch, epf <dig>  mute and fama transcript accumulations determined by quantitative pcr in 10 days-old pro35s:scap1-gr  plants treated by spraying with dex  and the whole seedlings were sampled at eight hours after treatment. values represent the mean of two biological replicates. in all quantitative pcr actin  was used for normalization. in c and d ** = p <  <dig>  and * = p <  <dig>  and two tails t student test. error bars = standard deviation



we next measured transcript accumulation of early stomatal patterning genes in plants with different dosage of scap <dig>  transcript levels of spch, epf <dig>  mute and fama were analysed at  <dig> das when levels of scap <dig>  spch and epf <dig> expression are at their peak in the wild type . in loss-of-function scap <dig> mutant plants we detected no significant changes in transcript levels of any of the genes analysed compared with the wild type . if spch and scap <dig> genetically interact we might predict that increased gc production in pro35s:scap1-yfp plants would be reflected in an increased level and/or activity of positive regulators of stomatal production, or alternatively down regulation of negative regulators. to determine if this is the case we analysed transcript levels of spch, epf <dig>  mute and fama in the pro35s:scap1-yfp over expression line. our analysis confirmed that this transgene conferred around 100-fold increase in scap <dig> transcript accumulation when compared to wild type . analysis at  <dig> das revealed no significant difference in transcript levels of either mute or fama compared to wild type . however, we noticed a down regulation of epf <dig> and, marginally, spch as compared to the wild type .

to confirm these observations we analysed the stomatal patterning genes in pro35s:scap1-gr plants after a short dex induction. we first tested the ability of scap1:gr protein to activate expression of its known target gene atmyb <dig>  <cit> . indeed, scap <dig> loss of function mutants displayed reduced levels of atmyb <dig> accumulation compared with wild type . conversely, compared to wild type plants, pro35s:scap1-gr plants showed up-regulation of atmyb <dig> after dex treatment . these data indicate that scap1-gr protein retains its biochemical function in the context of transcriptional regulation.

under similar conditions, eight hours after induction we observed a strong downregulation of the negative stomatal regulator epf <dig> . such epf <dig> downregulation became detectable in dex treated compared to mock treated plants after four hours and was maintained throughout our experiment . besides epf <dig> we also observed a general downregulation of spch transcript levels and its direct target gene mute, but not fama . as a control, dex treatment on wild type plants had no effects in altering stomata patterning genes . scap <dig> can therefore act both as a positive and negative transcriptional regulator. however as these experiments were performed on whole seedlings, they may not entirely revel the mode of action of scap <dig> during the early stages of leaf development.

scap <dig> affects spch protein accumulation
constitutive expression of scap <dig> resulted in several developmental abnormalities, which could indirectly alter gc development. to avoid this potential problem, we analysed the effect of scap <dig> after rapid activation by dex using the pro35s:scap1-gr line. we studied the pattern spch-gfp fusion protein accumulation in the primordia of the first leaf  through microscope confocal analysis by visualizing nuclear fluorescence of green fluorescent protein  in a prospch:spch-gfp line. at  <dig> das, we did not detect variations in the number of meristemoids, suggesting that scap1-gr expression did not yet produce detectable effects at this particular stage . we reasoned that by providing a short pulse of scap <dig>  we could influence the competence of cells entering the stomata lineage . we generated hemizygous prospch:spch-gfp propin3:pin3-gfp pro35s:scap1-gr or hemizygous prospch:spch-gfp propin3:pin3-gfp in a wild type col background. the pin3-gfp fusion protein was used as plasma membrane marker and allowed us to identify individual epidermal cells. in control double hemizygous prospch:spch-gfp propin3:pin3-gfp plants no significant differences were found in the number of spch-gfp expressing cells following dex treatment . also, dex treatment did not alter the average intensity of nuclear spch-gfp fluorescence, which rules out a general effect of dex on spch-gfp protein accumulation . prospch:spch-gfp propin3:pin3-gfp pro35s:scap1-gr hemizygous lines showed no apparent defects in spch-gfp accumulation at this developmental stage . at 6 hours following dex treatment, prospch:spch-gfp propin3:pin3-gfp pro35s:scap1-gr plants showed a significant increase in the proportion of nuclei expressing spch-gfp protein . furthermore, this was accompanied with a general increase in the mean nuclear gfp fluorescence intensity  . it is most likely that the increased nuclear gfp signals reflected increased spch-gfp protein since neither dex treatment or scap1-gr alone caused variations in nuclear gfp accumulations . increased spch stabilisation in protodermal cells may thus contribute to stomata pattering alterations in scap <dig> over expressing plants.fig.  <dig>

discussion
previously scap <dig> was shown to control gc morphology and activity, a role coherent with its expression in developing and fully mature stomata  <cit> . here we report an in-depth analysis of the spatio-temporal control of scap <dig> expression throughout leaf development. our results indicate an early activation of scap <dig> expression in leaf primordia coinciding with the expression of genes controlling stomatal cell lineage and thus before gc differentiation  <cit> . this pattern of scap <dig> gene expression is maintained in spch mutants demonstrating that scap <dig> early expression is independent of gc lineage specification. besides transcriptional regulation, scap <dig> is regulated at the post-transcriptional level, as constitutively expressed scap1-yfp fusion did not accumulate in all plant tissues, despite high levels of expression. in leaf primordia where scap <dig> promoter is active in both epidermis and mesophyll, scap1-yfp protein was mainly observed in the mesophyll and in gcs. this observation may either suggest that the role of scap <dig> in gc development is indirect . scap1-gr plants also had increased stomata cells density in true leaves arguing in favour of a direct role of scap <dig> in stomata patterning. furthermore, a detailed analysis of scap1-gr plants revealed a role of scap <dig> in both promoting gcs production and directing the spacing of meristemoid at the very early stages of stomatal cell lineage specification . these observations are indicative of a role of scap <dig> in gc patterning which is independent of its general function in gc maturation. the accumulation of scap <dig> transcript in young leaf primordia is consistent with an early role for scap <dig> in controlling gc development. scap <dig> could also play an additional role in the specification of gcs at later stages of leaf development, for example by controlling satellite meristemoid cells, since scap <dig> expression can be transiently detected in dividing  epidermal cells adjacent to differentiated gcs in older tissue .

the overall increased cell density of scap <dig> overexpressing plants is reminiscent of spch overexpression or epf <dig> mutant plants  <cit> . ectopic expression of scap <dig> could not initiate gcs development in the interior layers of cotyledons or leaves, suggesting that scap <dig> affects gcs production in conjunction with the known elements of stomatal cell lineage pathway . therefore, one attractive hypothesis arising from these observations is that scap <dig> participates in the same genetic pathway of gc development controlled by spch and its regulators. some evidence for this was provided by experiments which showed expression of spch, epf <dig> and scap <dig> temporarily overlapping during development. mutants of scap <dig> are not defective in global spch or epf <dig> gene expression levels, although we have not tested the possibility that the spatial distribution of spch or epf <dig> genes might be altered in scap <dig> mutant plants. furthermore, the relatively weak epidermal phenotype of scap <dig> mutants might be masked by a yet unknown scap1-like function.

not only did scap <dig> affect stomata number but also stomata spacing. clusters of gcs were present in post-embryonic tissues in pro35s:scap1-gr plants, a phenotype which was even further exacerbated upon dex application. surprisingly, this phenotype was not observed in pro35s:scap1-yfp plants . the reasons why the scap1-gr fusion is more active than scap1-yfp is currently unknown. as scap <dig> accumulation is tightly controlled at the posttranscriptional levels, one possibility is that the gr moiety protects it from degradation.

scap <dig> overexpression caused epf <dig> downregulation, which could account for spacing defects. the signalling peptides epf <dig> acts early in the stomatal lineage controlling asymmetric cell division and thus regulating stomatal density  <cit> . previously, comparably similar defects in stomata density and spacing were described in mutants of epf <dig>  epf <dig> and tmm , or in transgenic plants overexpressing spch, mute or fama  <cit> . the spch protein directly binds and positively regulates the transcription of several stomatal patterning genes including epf <dig>  mute and tmm as well as its own transcription  <cit> . our data indicates that some of the direct targets of spch are negatively regulated by scap <dig>  suggesting a competition between spch and scap <dig> for the regulation of these genes at transcriptional level. in this model, scap <dig> promotes stomata production and boosts cell divisions by enhancing spch protein accumulation possibly as a result of down regulation of epf <dig> transcript. whether this competition occurs in the same cell and/or is direct should be elucidated by further experiments.

CONCLUSIONS
our results highlight a previously unappreciated role for scap <dig> in stomata development. we propose that scap <dig> is an essential component of a genetic pathway to fine-tune stomatal production in arabidopsis. a key control mechanism of this loop could involve a scap1-mediated downregulation of epf <dig> counteracting the previously demonstrated spch–mediated activation of epf <dig>  <cit> . dof-type factors have been proposed to play an important role in gc maturation and function based on an enrichment of a dof binding motif in gc specific genes  <cit> . it would be interesting to test whether this observation can also be extended to genes involved in the early events of gc lineage specification. in this sense, scap <dig> may link gc patterning and function.
