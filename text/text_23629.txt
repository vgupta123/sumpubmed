BACKGROUND
periodontitis is a chronic destructive infectious disease of the tooth-supporting tissues. it is one of the most prevalent infectious diseases in the world. with percentages of moderate disease ranging from just below 20% in an age group of  <dig> to  <dig> year-olds in swedish and norwegian studies to even up to 38% of severe cases in the united states in an on average  <dig> year-old male population  <cit> . besides high prevalence also links to systemic diseases have been described. periodontitis has been associated with, amongst others, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus and rheumatoid arthritis  <cit> .

periodontitis leads to loss of sound teeth as supporting bone and connective tissue are slowly degraded as a result of an exaggerated host immune response triggered against a polymicrobial biofilm  <cit> .

in the oral cavity around  <dig> species can be detected, in subgingival and supragingival biofilm/plaque over  <dig> bacterial species are present  <cit> . many disease-related bacterial species in the subgingival plaque have been shown to be gram-negative anaerobes. among them, porphyromonas gingivalis a black-pigmented bacterium from the phylum bacteroidetes is a major causative agent in periodontal disease  <cit> .

interaction with other bacteria residing in the periodontal pocket is important to sustain the infectious biofilm. one of the structures involved in the inter-species adherence is the capsular polysaccharide  of p. gingivalis  <cit> . cps has been described as a virulence factor of various pathogenic bacteria, mainly as being involved in evasion of the host immune system  <cit> . in p. gingivalis encapsulated strains have been shown to be more resistant to serum killing and phagocytosis. the explanation for this increased resistance compared to the non-encapsulated strains may be the increased hydrophilicity and the lower induction of the alternative complement pathway  <cit> .

encapsulated p. gingivalis strains have also been shown to be more virulent than non-encapsulated strains in the mouse infection model  <cit> . to date, six capsular serotypes  have been described  <cit>  and a seventh serotype  has been suggested by r. e. schifferle . in a mouse subcutaneous infection model several strains of each of the serotypes have been shown to be highly virulent  <cit> . the variation of virulence within serotypes shows that besides cps there have to be more virulence factors of importance in p. gingivalis. many of its virulence factors have been studied in the last decades including fimbriae, hemagglutinins, lipopolysaccharide , outer membrane proteins  and an extremely wide variety of proteinases. high quality reviews have been published on the wide variety of p. gingivalis virulence factors  <cit> .

using comparative whole-genome hybridization analysis of the encapsulated w <dig> strain and the non-encapsulated atcc <dig> a cps biosynthesis locus had been found, after which a knock-out study has proven that the cps locus was functional  <cit> . k <dig> cps from w <dig> has been shown to induce a stronger chemokine response than cps from the other serotypes in murine macrophages  <cit> . recent work in our group, however, has shown that an isogenic w <dig> mutant lacking cps triggers a higher pro-inflammatory immune response in human gingival fibroblasts than strain w <dig> carrying k <dig> cps  <cit> . the exact roles of cps in p. gingivalis are still unclear, but reducing the host immune response is certainly one of them.

in the latest years an increasing number of genomes have been sequenced paving the path for genomics-based approaches. for p. gingivalis genome sequences of the virulent strain w <dig> and the less-virulent strain atcc <dig> have become available  <cit> . comparative genomic hybridization  analysis using microarrays of these well-described bacterial strains could yield new insights in the virulence mechanisms of p. gingivalis. a recent study reported on the cgh analysis of several p. gingivalis strains to describe the genetic variety among them  <cit> .

in this study we analyzed the genetic contents of representative strains of each of the seven capsular serotypes : w <dig> , hg <dig> , atcc <dig> , atcc <dig> , hg <dig> , hg <dig> , 34- <dig> . we also included the non-encapsulated strain fdc <dig>  in the cgh analysis to compare with each of the encapsulated strains. strain fdc <dig> does however express a non-cps anionic extracellular polysaccharide as do the other strains  <cit> . the strains were classified into three virulence levels as determined by using a subcutaneous mouse infection model  <cit> . although not an optimal measure for the ability to cause periodontitis, this classification has long been used  <cit>  and proven useful in studying virulence determinants  <cit> .

triplicate hybridization experiments and three types of analysis, 1) aberrant gene calling, 2) breakpoint analysis and 3) absent gene calling, have been performed for optimal use of the new genetic information. the careful design of the experiment and the thorough analysis of the data lead to a high resolution data set, yielding more detailed information on the genetic differences between strains than has been shown before. in this study we initiate the description of a core-gene set of p. gingivalis allowing a more focused search for potential important virulence factors.

RESULTS
microarray performance and data interpretation
the p. gingivalis version  <dig> microarray from the pfgrc used in this study has been used in several studies before  <cit>  and consists of  <dig> probes and  <dig> negative control probes  printed in four replicates. the microarray was designed to cover all non-redundant coding sequences  of the p. gingivalis w <dig> genome. before our study all probes were analyzed for their unique- and perfect matching with the genome, as downloaded from the ncbi, using blast. twenty-nine of the  <dig> probes of the microarray gave non-specific hits, mostly related to transposases . these probes were excluded from further analyses together with four probes that were not in use anymore annotated "obsolete" by the manufacturer, so that  <dig> probes remained. the comparison of each test strain to w <dig> using this array gives insights into described virulence associated genes. a limitation of the method, however, is that genes from the variable gene pool from other strains will not be detected.

data were normalized and technical and biological replicates were collapsed as described in the materials and methods. detailed analysis of the probe intensities indicated that  <dig> probes gave systematically low intensity values for strain w <dig> as well as for all the other strains. the intensity levels were at the same low levels as the intensity levels of the negative control probes . these probes were labeled as "dead probes" and excluded from the results . our data do not explain why dead probes have occurred in our experiments, but the consistent low signal for these probes suggests that the sequencing information used for designing these probes was imperfect.

in order to maximize the mining of the genomic information, we subjected the data to three complementary analyses: 1) analysis for aberrations as detected by individual probes, 2) analysis for breakpoints, and 3) analysis for genomic loss. the rationale behind the three analyses is as follows. the probed genomic sites are on average  <dig> bp apart from each other , which was not considered to be a high interrogation density. we therefore decided to analyze each probe individually for indication that the genomic site interrogated is aberrant from w <dig>  deviations from w <dig> that were detected with a false discovery rate corrected p-value  <  <dig>  were considered significant. this aberrance could have occurred due to mutations or loss , and this was regarded as point-variability between the strains. nevertheless, if several neighboring probes indicate aberrations, then this may indicate highly variable regions due to mutations or loss. hence, a breakpoint analysis was executed to quantitatively specify such regions. finally, we used the negative controls to define absent calls with the aim to distinguish whether an aberration was found more likely due to mutation or loss. if the probes that indicated aberrations in the first analysis also showed the same intensities as the negative controls with fdr corrected p-value <  <dig>  , the genomic site was considered as mutated, and otherwise it was considered as lost. this last analysis enhanced our interpretation of the data and the definition of the core genome.

p. gingivalis core genome
research on microbial pathogens is mostly performed to unravel mechanisms of virulence in order to design effective treatments. virulence mechanisms present in all strains of a species are especially attractive. the description of a core set of genes present in a species is thus a key step for better understanding. from an analysis of eight p. gingivalis strains we found that  <dig> genes were non-aberrantly present in each of the strains and  <dig> hypothetical genes were called absent but non-aberrant . the conserved core genes make up 80% of all genes included in this study. hence, 20%  of all genes of w <dig> were aberrant in at least one of the strains. core genomes from several bacterial species have been described  <cit> . the fraction of a bacterial genome that consists of core genes depends highly on the amount of strains included to describe the core genome  <cit> . the more strains are used, the smaller the core genome will be. as such, the very well studied escherichia coli core genome makes up only 46% of the average e. coli genome. other bacterial species, including gram positives and gram negatives, have been found to have a core genome which covers 52% to 85% of a genome  <cit> . the 80% of w <dig> genes which are part of the conserved core genome can therefore be understood. it must be clear though that the core genome of p. gingivalis as described here must be seen as a first step. the core genome will be found to be smaller as more genetic information on different p. gingivalis strains will become available.

we could distinguish two gene sets in the aberrant set, namely the present and absent genes . using aberrance and absent call analysis we were thus able to describe the p. gingivalis core genome in two ways. aberrance represents mutations within the probe sequence, whereas absent calls represents the total absence of the probe sequence interpreted as gene absence. the fully conserved p. gingivalis core genome is comprised of  <dig> genes. the variable core genome is comprised of a total of  <dig> genes, which are aberrant, but called present . in the further analyses the conserved core genome was taken as the core genome.

combining our findings on the core genome with a study describing  <dig> conserved cdss when comparing the genome sequences of w <dig> and atcc <dig>  <cit> , makes it tempting to speculate that the core genome as described here may already be close to its final size. an analysis combining the conserved cdss from that study with our  <dig> conserved core genes showed that when strain atcc <dig> is included the core genome size decreased to  <dig> genes.

the conserved core gene set was analyzed for the presence of virulence genes. when it was analyzed for the presence of the  <dig> potentially virulence associated gene set originating from when the genome sequence of w <dig> became available   <cit> , it was found that  <dig> genes were present in all strains . only  <dig> genes were aberrant in at least one strain, among which  <dig> usual suspects from the cps locus, but also four hemagglutinins.

another virulence gene set was also tested for presence in the conserved core gene set of p. gingivalis. the set was composed of genes shown to be up-regulated in infection experiments  <cit> . genes up-regulated in an in vitro human epithelial cell infection experiment were combined with a gene set in vivo up-regulated on protein level in a mouse subcutanuous chamber experiment to make a set of  <dig> virulence genes. the former experiment was chosen as an early response gene set, whereas the latter includes genes involved in sustaining an infection in vivo.  <dig> of the  <dig> virulence genes were present among the core gene set . the two genes that were not in the core gene set were a thiol protease   <cit>  and tetr a transcription regulator . the thiol protease is aberrant in each strain except for strain atcc <dig>  from the 16s-23s isr heteroduplex type that together with the type of strain w <dig> has the highest association with disease  <cit> . this is another indication that this thiol protease may be an important determinant in virulence of p. gingivalis. transcription regulator tetr was only found to be aberrant in strain fdc <dig>  which is the least virulent and the only non-encapsulated strain  <cit> .

the analysis of the core gene set shows the presence of almost all virulence related genes. the genes that are not present in the core genome may be determinants of the differences in virulence found between the strains.

strain divergence
the divergences of the test strains were determined by the percentage of aberrant cdss from the total number of  <dig> cdss included in this study. we found  <dig> % to  <dig> % of aberrant genes per strain, with atcc <dig> having the lowest and fdc <dig> having the highest percentage of aberrant genes . these percentages of aberrant genes are higher than the 7% of aberrant genes from a previous genomic hybridization study on strain atcc <dig>  a close relative of strain fdc <dig>  <cit> . from the  <dig> highly aberrant genes in atcc <dig>  <dig> genes were included in our study from which  <dig> were in the aberrant gene list of strain fdc <dig>  a recent study reported even lower percentages 0- <dig> % of divergence between p. gingivalis strains  <cit> . although they used the same arrays and also used some identical strains the differences between our data sets were substantial. we detect a much higher number of aberrant genes probably because of higher resolution due to the use of three arrays per strain. we also excluded a set of  <dig> genes before the analyses  which further elevated the percentages found in this study.

proteases
p. gingivalis is known to have a vast arsenal of proteases. the main function of these enzymes is to provide peptides for growth. these peptides can be derived from host-proteins, involved in defence against pathogens, thereby potentially disrupting the host immune response. other proteases degrade collagen, thereby weakening the tooth-supporting tissues. proteases have therefore been regarded as important virulence factors. a selection of  <dig> proteases/peptidases was made by text searches in the p. gingivalis w <dig> genome annotation combined with peptidases found in the merops p. gingivalis peptidase database  <cit>  . this selection was analyzed for presence in the test strains. from the analysis it was clear that most proteases,  <dig> in total, belong to the core gene set of p. gingivalis. from the  <dig> non-core protease genes  tpr was already mentioned earlier. the gene prtc, a collagenase, was found to be aberrant only in three strains with medium/low virulence in a subcutaneous mouse model. interestingly, in early studies on p. gingivalis virulence one of the discriminatory factors between virulent and avirulent strains was described to be collagenase activity, which was found to be low in avirulent strains  <cit> . another non-core protease gene is the well-described rgpa, an arg-gingipain which has regularly been described as one of the most important virulence factors of p. gingivalis  <cit> . rgpa is aberrant in the highly virulent strain atcc <dig>  this finding is however in line with a murine periodontitis model study in which rgpa was found to be not important in virulence using p. gingivalis knockouts  <cit> . from the present study, however, no hard conclusion should be drawn as no functional changes have been explored.

the capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis locus
analysis of the cps biosynthesis locus  <cit>  of the test strains revealed a high variation as seen in figure 4a showing the hybridization log-ratios against w <dig>  our interpretation of the log-ratios depicted as a heat map showing presence, aberrance and absence of each of the cps-locus genes is shown in figure 4b. only pg <dig> and pg <dig> show no divergence in any strain and are thus among the core gene set as described earlier. the other genes in the locus show at least some aberrance. pg <dig> and pg <dig> are called absent in each test strain as concluded from our hybridization experiments. this supports the choice of these genes to design a k1-specific pcr for serotyping in our group  <cit> . all test strains are found to be aberrant for at least  <dig> genes, except strain 34- <dig>  which only shows aberrance in  <dig> genes. these findings may suggest that the different capsular serotypes can be highly variable in structure and that k <dig> cps may share more common elements with the k <dig> type of cps than the other test strains.

highly variable regions
an analysis was performed to calculate the chance that certain genetic regions of the w <dig> genome are missing in the test strains included in the hybridization experiments. this was done using breakpoint analysis, which takes the divergence of neighbouring genes into account. in this analysis  <dig> highly variable regions were found . three regions, regions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  have already been reported earlier based on aberrance in strain atcc <dig>  <cit>  , but only a function for the cps biosynthesis locus has been described. the function of the other two may be pathogenicity islands, although no prove has been reported yet. region  <dig> which includes raga and ragb is in addition to w <dig> only present in strain atcc <dig>  both strains are representatives of the 16s-23s isr heteroduplex types that have the strongest association with disease. the other strains lack this region. this region has also been described as disease related directly by pcr of subgingival samples  <cit> . region  <dig> includes pgaa, which also has been described as a virulence determinant  <cit> . the other highly variable regions may be involved in virulence, but too little is known to speculate on the functions.

another region that was found to be interesting in this analysis is region pg1981-pg <dig> which is comprised of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat  associated genes   <cit> . together with crisprs, located directly downstream of pg <dig>  these types of genes have been described as the immune system of bacteria against foreign dna, e.g. plasmids and viruses. recently they also have been described as a useful tool in epidemiology  <cit> . variation is expected to be high in these regions as they encompass exogenous dna sequence fragments from infection events that happened to the strain or its ancestors. here variation within the cas genes is evident, but not as high as the other regions mentioned in this section.

w83-specific genes
strain w <dig> has been described as a highly virulent strain. what makes this strain special is however not specifically known. the purified cps of w <dig> has been shown to induce a higher immune response than other types of cps  <cit> . removal of the capsular structure, by genetic interruption of cps-biosynthesis, however resulted in a much higher immune response when infecting fibroblasts with viable p. gingivalis  <cit> . what this means for virulence in a mouse model has not yet been addressed. with the data presented here a more detailed study is possible to find specific traits that make w <dig> different. a list of all genes that are aberrant in each of the test strains and absent in each of the test strains is presented . among the  <dig> genes that were aberrant in all test strains there were  <dig> dna mobilization genes,  <dig> dna modification genes,  <dig> cps biosynthesis genes,  <dig> carbohydrate metabolism genes,  <dig> transcriptional regulator genes,  <dig> lipoprotein genes and  <dig>  hypothetical protein genes. from this gene set  <dig> genes were w83-specific as they were absent in each of the test strains. in this way the prtt protease gene and a fimbrillin gene  were found to be aberrant in all test strains, but not w83-specific as they were present in one or more test strains. the results for fima support the findings that the gene is widely distributed, but variable at the probe locus among p. gingivalis strains. many of the genes found in this analysis are located within the highly variable regions described in earlier publications using whole-genome analysis. the existence of those regions were supported by data comparing the genome sequences of p. gingivalis strains w <dig> and atcc <dig>  <cit> . also in this study we found these regions back in the analysis as described above

genes only aberrant in fdc381
fdc <dig> is the only strain included in this study that does not produce cps. it is also the least virulent strain in mouse studies. here, an analysis was performed to find genes that are specifically aberrant in fdc <dig> and not in all the other test strains . alongside many genes encoding hypothetical proteins several genes of special interest were found. the genes pg <dig> encoding an alpha- <dig> -mannosidase family protein, and pg <dig> encoding the hemagglutinin hagb, all thought to be involved in virulence either by a role in evasion of the immune system or by a role in adhesion to host cells  <cit> .

although these data do not directly show any cps biosynthesis specific genes aberrant only in the non-encapsulated fdc <dig> it does give hints towards other virulence associated traits that are missing in fdc <dig> 

high versus lower virulence strains
when comparing the core gene set of only the highly virulent strains w <dig>  hg <dig>  atcc <dig> and hg <dig> with the genes aberrant in each of the less virulent strains hg <dig>  hg <dig>  34- <dig> and fdc <dig> an interesting result was seen. there is only a single gene, hmus, that is present in all highly virulent strains but aberrant in each of the less virulent strains. hmus is part of the hmuyrstuv haemin uptake system  <cit> . haemin acquisition is vital for p. gingivalis which makes the haemin uptake and storage system relevant study objects. lacking part of an important uptake mechanism could have consequences for infection and survival. however, in these experiments no functional differences have been shown.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we analyzed the genetic contents of representative strains of each of the seven capsular serotypes. comparative genomic hybridization shows that gene aberrance among p. gingivalis strains can be up to  <dig> %, which is higher than previously reported. the p. gingivalis genome is variable with 20% of the w <dig> gene content being aberrant in at least one of the seven test strains. analysis of virulence-related genes conservation was performed; only a few virulence-related genes were shown to be aberrant among test strains. as could be expected due to the choice of strains it was found that among the most aberrant virulence genes were the cps biosynthesis genes.

in this study we initiated the description of a core genome of the anaerobic bacterium p. gingivalis, one of the most important causative agents of periodontitis allowing a more focused search for potential important virulence factors of which several were identified
