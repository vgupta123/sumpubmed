BACKGROUND
the net is a na+ and cl-- dependent transporter, which is expressed by noradrenergic neurons. net function in adult noradrenergic neurons is the clearing of secreted ne from the synaptic cleft via selective high-affinity uptake  <cit> . drugs that block ne transport, such as the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine and the drug of abuse, cocaine, inhibit ne transport  <cit>  and differentiation of cultured neural crest cells into noradrenergic neuroblasts  <cit> . netko mice have reduced body temperature  and reduced body weight , they are supersensitive to psychostimulants, such as cocaine and amphetamine, they have reduced intracellular ne, increased ne synthesis and elevated extracellular ne  <cit> . in humans, abnormal net function leads to orthostatic intolerance and is involved in depression, anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , and autonomic dysfunction  <cit> . net may have additional functions during noradrenergic cell differentiation, as net protein is expressed in a variety of different tissues in avian and mouse embryos  <cit> . net expression in mouse embryonic neural crest cells is regulated by the autocrine growth factors, neurotrophin- <dig> , fibroblast growth factor- <dig>  and transforming growth factor-β <dig> . the role of net and the regulation of its function in noradrenergic homeostasis and ne signaling are well established. net function is regulated by extracellular and intracellular signaling pathways that involve several associated proteins, including the snare protein syntaxin 1a, protein phosphatase 2a  catalytic subunit , pick <dig>  hic- <dig>  and pp2a anchoring subunit   <cit> . little is known, however, on how absence of the net gene affects differentiation of neural crest stem cells into noradrenergic cells.

here we report results obtained with longsage gene expression profiling and analyses on differentiating noradrenergic neurons/progenitors from the embryonic neural crest, the adult superior cervical ganglion and the locus ceruleus. sage has been developed by velculescu et al  <cit>  as a tool to quantify the transcriptome. it is based on the isolation and sequencing of unique sequences  from defined positions at the 3' end of each mrna molecule. sage has the advantage of high-efficient gene identification, which allows for unbiased and comprehensive analysis of a large number of differentially expressed genes without prior knowledge of the genes. the principle of longsage is the same as in the original approach, except that it uses another type iis restriction enzyme, mme <dig>  to generate  <dig> bp tags, rather than the  <dig> bp tags in conventional sage  <cit> . thus longsage allows for annotation of a larger portion of tags than sage.

RESULTS
time course of mouse net gene expression and function during wild type neural crest cell differentiation in vitro
to determine the optimal stage of in vitro development for rna collection, we performed a time-course of net expression and function in wild type mouse neural crest cell cultures. both, net mrna  and high affinity 3h-norepinephrine uptake-positive cells  were first detected on culture day  <dig> in a subset of neural crest cells. at culture day  <dig>  uptake-positive cells lacked processes and showed the morphology of undifferentiated neural crest cells . by culture day  <dig>  many 3h-ne uptake-positive cells were multipolar with long processes and they tended to form aggregates , whereas others showed a functional net but had undifferentiated morphology as determined by the absence of processes . expression of catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes in mouse neural crest cell cultures starts around culture day  <dig> and newly catecholamine-positive cells continue to appear in progressively larger numbers, as stem cells persist for several more weeks in culture, self-renew and their progeny continue to differentiate. thus day  <dig> cultures capture all stages of in vitro development. they contain neural crest stem cells, undefined net-negative progenitor cells, cells with net function and immature morphology, as well as cells with net function and neuronal morphology as judged by the elaboration of long processes . for this reason day  <dig> cultures were chosen as a source of rna for gene expression profiling. for the purpose of the present study we use expression of catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes and elaboration of processes as measures for neuronal differentiation. among cells with morphology of differentiated cells, 3h-ne uptake-positive cells with neuronal morphology were observed only, indicating that in these cultures functional net was limited to differentiating neuroblasts/neuronal progenitors. this notion is supported by the complete absence in the longsage libraries of differentially expressed genes that are characteristic for non-neuronal neural crest derivatives, such as smooth muscle cells, bone/cartilage cells or pigment cells.

summary of longsage libraries and longsage tag-to-gene mapping
we collected at total of  <dig>  long-tags from netko neural crest rna . the library has been deposited in gene expression omnibus  at  under geo accession number gse <dig>  the wild type library has been deposited previously and has been included by ncbi in the present series.

the wild type library consisted of  <dig>  unique long-tags, whereas the netko library contained  <dig>  unique longsage tags . these unique tags were matched to the longsage database  for gene identification. only  <dig>  longsage tags in the wild type library and  <dig>  longsage tags in the netko library were present in more than  <dig> copies . ninety-five percent of longsage tags in the wild type library and  <dig> % longsage tags in the netko library were represented by  <dig> or fewer copies . this distribution is consistent with that observed in other cell types with conventional sage  <cit> .

of the unique longsage tags,  <dig>   tags in the wild type library and  <dig>   tags in the netko library could be matched to known expressed sequences.  <dig>   tags in the wild type library and  <dig>   tags in the netko library were tags without matches to known sequences. they could represent novel genes or sequencing errors. of the matched longsage tags,  <dig>   longsage tags in the wild type library and  <dig>   longsage tags in the netko library were single-matched tags. sequences that matched to more than one sequence located in different unigene clusters,  <dig>   longsage tags in the wild type library and  <dig>   in the netko library, were excluded from analysis.

quality and equality of the wild type and netko longsage libraries
several lines of evidence show the quality and equality of the two longsage libraries. first, the tag distribution between the two libraries and the longsage tag-to-gene mapping in both libraries were similar . second, as expected, most genes expressed by in vitro differentiating neural crest cells in day  <dig> cultures were unchanged because of the deletion of the net gene . as an additional quality control, we have analyzed the top  <dig> tags of both libraries . these tags accounted for  <dig> % in the wild type library and  <dig> % in the netko library. eighty-five of the top  <dig> tags, and  <dig> of the top  <dig> tags, were common to both libraries . third, the expression of common house keeping genes, such as beta-actin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase , ribosomal protein l <dig>  beta- <dig> microglobulin, and ubiquitin c were expressed at similar levels in both libraries .

comparative analysis according to stringent criteria  identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes;  <dig> sequences were up-regulated in netko neural crest cells and  <dig> sequences were down-regulated . taken together, we provide a high quality netko longsage gene expression library of medium size. by comparing it to an equivalent wild type library according to stringent criteria, we have identified a number of differentially expressed genes.

differential expression of noradrenergic biosynthetic enzymes
deletion of the net gene affects expression of noradrenergic biosynthetic enzymes  <cit>  and net function has been implicated in noradrenergic cell differentiation  <cit> . we validated by real-time pcr the differential expression of genes relevant to catecholamine metabolism in embryonic neural crest cells and in the adult locus ceruleus and superior cervical ganglion . dopamine-β-hydroxylase  and tyrosine hydroxylase , were significantly up-regulated in netko tissue in all three locations , confirming equivalent data by xu et al.  <cit> . monoamine oxidase-a  was down regulated in all three tissues, whereas catechol o-methyltransferase  was not significantly affected .

for determining mrna levels, the 2-ΔΔct method was used as described. for a given target, Δct was computed by subtracting ct for hprt from each primer pair. ct and ΔΔc were computed by subtracting Δct for wt from Δct for netko. the difference of the expression level for each gene was expressed as 2-ΔΔct. statistical analysis was performed using the student's t test. qpcr data are presented as mean ± s.e.m., and significant differences between ko and wt reported at the p <  <dig>  level; n =  <dig> 

the morphology and percentage of netko and wild type in vitro differentiating noradrenergic neural crest-derived cells differed . in wild type neural crest cultures, many cells were dbh-immunoreactive and showed long processes , whereas dbh-immunoreactive netko cells had no processes or short extensions only . furthermore, netko neural crest cultures contained only about half the number of dbh-immunoreactive cells per area compared to wild type cultures . the reduced numbers of in vitro differentiating netko neural crest-derived noradrenergic cells is in agreement with our earlier observations that ne uptake by the net promoted noradrenergic differentiation, whereas net blockers were inhibitory  <cit> . taken together the data suggest that fewer neural crest cells differentiated into noradrenergic cells in the absence of net, but that the cells that did become noradrenergic expressed higher transcript levels of biosynthetic enzymes that lead to the production of norepinephrine.

differential expression of cart, htr3a and tlx2
cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript , the serotonin receptor subunit, htr3a  and the t-cell leukemia homeobox  <dig>  were significantly more abundant in the netko longsage library compared to the wild type library . altered expression of all three genes may contribute to the netko phenotype.

one aspect of the netko phenotype is hyper-responsiveness to psychostimulants, such as cocaine or amphetamine  <cit> . cart is a putative neurotransmitter, or co-transmitter, in the brain, in the adrenal gland and in neural crest-derived enteric ganglia  <cit> . cart expression is up-regulated in response to acute administration of psychostimulants  <cit> . cart peptide co-localizes with noradrenergic neurons in the locus ceruleus, in noradrenergic c <dig> neurons and in the nodose ganglion  <cit> . the cart peptide modulates the activity of the striatal noradrenergic and the corticostriatal and hypothalamic serotonergic systems in the rat brain and it is involved in feeding, emotional and locomotor behavior  <cit> . it can produce anxiety-like effects in rodents  <cit> . we confirmed differential expression and co-localization of cart by real-time pcr and at the protein level by immunocytochemistry in embryonic neural crest cultures, in the adult superior cervical ganglion and in the adult locus ceruleus . it is conceivable that elevated cart expression in netko mice causes their hyper-responsiveness to psychostimulants. while there also seemed to be an increase in intensity of immunofluorescence for dbh and cart in netko tissue, we did not pursue quantification of fluorescence.

the a subunit of the 5-ht <dig> receptor, htr3a, is 11-fold more abundant in the netko library than in the wild type library . we confirmed by real-time pcr this up-regulation of htr3a in netko neural crest, locus ceruleus and superior cervical ganglion cells . serotonin  is a neurotransmitter that interacts with multiple receptors to mediate a wide range of effects, including involvement in anxiety and depression  <cit> . additionally, htr3a mrna is present both in submucosal and myenteric ganglia in enterochromaffin cells of the gut, which activate the 5-ht3a receptor in extrinsic primary afferent neurons  <cit> . the 5-ht3a receptor is thus a link between gut and brain. since 5-ht3a antagonists cause constipation, the function of the 5-ht3a receptor is considered important for normal enteric motility  <cit> . htr3a over-expression therefore could affect serotonin signaling and thus peristalsis. in our present study, nsg <dig>  and cart were significantly more abundant in the netko library than in the wild type library . interestingly, both genes were found to be down-regulated in the ret-deficient enteric nervous system  <cit> . together, the two studies suggest that net and ret are upstream of nsg <dig> and cart, and that they have opposing effects on nsg <dig> and cart expression. this is of interest, as ret-deficient mice have hirschsprung's syndrome, i.e. absence of distal enteric ganglia.

t-cell leukemia homeobox  <dig>  was 12-fold more abundant in the netko longsage library than in the wild type library . tlx <dig> encodes a transcription factor downstream of bmp signaling, which is essential for the development of sympathetic neurons, as it is activated by, and binds to, phox2b  <cit> . an imbalance between tlx <dig> and phox2b expression may affect autonomic nervous system development, as phox2b is essential for the differentiation of neural crest cells into autonomic neurons  <cit> .

in addition to htr3a, cart and tlx <dig> are also expressed in the gastrointestinal tract. cart is expressed in enteric neurons and is thought to serve a modulatory function in the enteric nervous system  <cit> . tlx <dig> knock-out mice demonstrate lethal intestinal pseudo-obstruction and colonic hyperganglionosis, similar to human intestinal neuronal dysplasia  <cit> . since tlx <dig> is not only expressed in neural crest-derived enteric neurons, but also in visceral smooth muscle cells  <cit> , perturbation of gastrointestinal function may not be limited to enteric nervous system dysfunction, but also be due to defects in the enteric smooth musculature.

taken together, over-expression of cart, htr3a and/or tlx <dig>  is likely to cause a perturbation in noradrenergic cell differentiation and in enteric nervous system function in netko mice. differential expression of the alpha-noradrenergic receptor, alpha-noradrenergic receptor  <cit>  and neurotrophin- <dig>  <cit>  were observed by bönisch and collaborators by real-time pcr and at the protein level. we did not capture these genes in our libraries. the discrepancy could be due to differences in the starting material used, as we have collected rna from embryonic neural crest stem cells, whereas in the other two studies  <cit>  adult brain tissue was used. conversely, these transcripts may have escaped detection in our libraries. the latter possibility is unlikely, as we have not observed the three genes in any of our  <dig> neural crest longsage libraries .

differential expression of members of the notch pathway in netko neural crest cells
numbl  and app  repress notch activity  <cit> . both numbl and app were significantly increased in the netko library , suggesting decreased notch signaling in netko cells. the notch pathway is, however, essential for induction of the neural crest. it is required for initiation of bmp- <dig> expression, and thus neural crest identity, in cells at the boundary between somatic and neural ectoderm  <cit> . notch signaling is involved in neural crest formation and noradrenergic cell differentiation, as well as in many other systems. loss of numbl function leads to a premature depletion of neuronal progenitor cells  <cit> . since numbl transcripts are significantly more abundant in netko neural crest cells , this result suggests that deletion of the net gene causes noradrenergic precursor cells, such as neural crest cells, to preferentially remain in the neuronal progenitor cell compartment. the notion of decreased differentiation due to persisting progenitor state is supported by the 12-fold decrease in the expression of histone deacetylase  <dig> . overall, our data indicate perturbations in the notch signaling pathway in netko cells, which is likely to affect neural crest formation and subsequent noradrenergic cell differentiation.

deregulation of the tgf-β and bmp signaling pathways
tgf-β signaling inhibits proliferation of neural crest cells and promotes their differentiation into autonomic neurons  <cit> . praja <dig> , a ring h- <dig> protein with e2-dependent e <dig> ubiquitin ligase activity, is 12-fold more abundant in the netko library  and 7-fold increased according to qpcr . praja <dig> ubiquitinates the smad adaptor protein, elf, which subsequently leads to its degradation and a decrease in smad <dig> expression  <cit> . smad <dig> is a critical member of tgf-β signaling, as it forms a complex with a receptor-regulated smad . the complex subsequently serves as a transcripton factor for tgf-β target genes  <cit> . in summary, elevated pja <dig> expression can inhibit tgf-β signaling and therefore is likely to maintain neural crest cells in their progenitor state by blocking their differentiation into noradrenergic cells. yet another important family of growth factors involved in noradrenergic differentiation are bone morphogenetic proteins . bmp <dig> was found to be required for noradrenergic differentiation in chick embryos  <cit> . in agreement with this notion we found in the present study that bmp <dig> is significantly down-regulated in netko neural crest cells .

CONCLUSIONS
net is an important gene in the central, autonomic and enteric nervous systems, as mutations in the net gene have been shown to have profound influences in homeostasis and cognition. in this study we have primarily focused on the role of net in embryonic neural crest development, but also have validated selected data in adult brain and peripheral nervous system tissues. specifically, we have provided evidence that high-affinity uptake of norepinephrine through net affects expression of genes that are involved in neural crest formation and in noradrenergic differentiation as measured by expression of catcholamine biosynthetic enzymes and elaboration of processes. the data further suggest changes in enteric nervous system function and possibly brain development/function in the absence of net function. we have confirmed that expression of noradrenergic biosynthetic enzymes is altered in netko mice. other pertinent differentially expressed genes addressed in detail in this work include htr3a, numbl, app, praja <dig> and tlx <dig>  we have identified differentially expressed genes that are likely to contribute to the netko phenotype, that is over-expression in netko cells of th, dbh, cart, htr3a and tlx <dig>  interestingly these genes are not only expressed in the neural crest-derived autonomic nervous system and in the brain, but they also have key functions in another neural crest derivative, the enteric nervous system. other differentially expressed transcripts, as for instance tgfb <dig> and hoxa <dig> , as well as cdc <dig> and hoxb <dig> , play important roles in cell proliferation and differentiation but have not been addressed in the current study. overall, we provide a valuable database for future investigations into net function.
