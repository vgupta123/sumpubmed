BACKGROUND
salmonella enterica subspecies enterica is an important zoonotic pathogen of warm-blooded vertebrates, with both a broad host species range and geographical distribution. the subspecies can be divided into over  <dig> serovars based on the different epitopes of two surface antigens  <cit> . epidemiological reports on isolations of s. enterica serovars from different livestock species in the uk have revealed interesting trends in association between particular serovars and defined subsets of livestock species  <cit> . associations between host species and serovars may reflect the acquisition, by the pathogen, of host adaptations during its evolutionary history  <cit> .

in previous work we characterised two strains of each of s. derby  and s. mbandaka  . isolation statistics suggest that these serovars have different host species biases in the uk. s. derby is most frequently isolated from pigs  and turkeys  and s. mbandaka is most frequently isolated from cattle  and chickens . during  <dig> in the uk, s. mbandaka was the most frequently isolated serovar from animal feed, accounting for  <dig> of 341 s. enterica isolations whereas s. derby accounted for just  <dig>  for the same period there were no isolations of s. mbandaka from pigs and less than 1 % of isolations were made from turkeys, similarly s. derby was not isolated from cattle and less than 1 % of isolations were from chickens  <cit> . we identified several potential mechanisms pertaining to host adaptation through comparative functional genomics  <cit> . we demonstrated that salmonella pathogenicity island  <dig> , an island discovered in the genome of s. derby and absent from the genome of s. mbandaka, plays a role in tissue tropism to porcine jejunum over porcine colon  <cit> . we also showed that the metabolite utilisation of s. derby d <dig> and s. mbandaka m <dig>  was different at ambient and porcine body temperatures, under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. this data led us to suggest that s. mbandaka may be better adapted than s. derby to using metabolites found in soybean based feeds under ambient conditions  <cit> . these observations have strengthened our original hypothesis that s. derby isolates d <dig> and d <dig> and s. mbandaka isolates m <dig> and m <dig> are adapted to distinct niches.

whilst the observations made on four isolates provide clues on niche and host adaptation, we require a broader population study in order to test the hypothesis that certain genotypes/phenotypes shown by s. derby and s. mbandaka are associated with different biological attributes of the hosts/niches and therefore contribute to the observed isolation bias. since our original observation of host association was made from the isolation statistics of salmonella incidences in livestock in the uk between  <dig> and  <dig>  we chose to characterise  <dig> isolates spanning both this location and time. should there be consistency across this representative population we are better placed to suggest that specific characteristics do contribute to the host distributions. since the strains used in this study were classified at serogroup level, a typing scheme shown previously to construct paraphyletic groupings, we produced a phylogenetic reconstruction and placed results of genotyping and phenotyping assays in context of this structure  <cit> . the move from phenotypic to genetic typing also provided the potential to identify if the uk isolations of these serovars reflect one generalist lineage of each serovar or if there were sub-lineages specialised to each host organism.

in the context of the population structure we expand on findings from our previous publications which focused on just two strains of each serovar. we show that the uk isolations of s. mbandaka comprise of one clonal lineage which is adapted to proficient utilisation of metabolites found in soya beans. we also show that this clonal lineage forms a biofilm at 25 °c, suggesting that this serovar may be well adapted to survival ex vivo, growing in animal feed. conversely, we show that s. derby is made of two distinct lineages, l <dig> and l <dig>  these lineages differ genotypically and phenotypically, being divided by the presence and absence of spi- <dig> and a tendency to be more proficient at invading porcine jejunum derived cell line ipec-j <dig>  we go on to suggest that l <dig> which is isolated from pigs and turkeys is better adapted to pathogenicity in a porcine host, whereas l <dig>  which has only been recovered from turkeys in the panel of isolates studied here as well as in publicly available mlst profiles, is better adapted to survival ex vivo, as it forms a biofilm at 25 °c.

RESULTS
population structure of uk isolates of s. derby and s. mbandaka
the population structure in the uk of s. derby and s. mbandaka was investigated through phylogenetic reconstruction using mlst sequence concatemers of isolates collected between  <dig> and  <dig>  in addition, five public mlst profiles  were added to the analysis to provide wider context to phylogenetic trends. all isolates clustered by their respective serovars . between s. derby and s. mbandaka there were  <dig> consensus snps that distinguished the serovars over the 3336 bps of the mlst sequence concatemer. s. mbandaka isolates formed a single, clonal lineage possessing sequence type st <dig>  with the exception of the public strain mp <dig>  which possessed mlst type st <dig>  this particular instance was isolated in  <dig> in canada from a porcine host. s. derby isolates formed two distinct lineages, l <dig> was isolated from pigs and turkeys  possessing the sequence type st <dig> with the exception of one isolate, d <dig>  which possessed the sequence type st <dig>  these st types differ by  <dig> variant positions spread across all  <dig> loci. in addition, isolate d <dig> was typed as st678; this st type differed from st <dig> at only  <dig> positions, all in a single loci, pure. l <dig> was formed of isolates made from turkeys , with sequence type st <dig> as well as public isolate dp <dig> which possessed mlst type st <dig>  the two lineages of s. derby were distinguished by  <dig> consensus snps over the 3336 bps of the mlst concatemer. three public s. derby isolates de <dig>  de <dig> and de <dig> were isolated in  <dig> in north america from a pig, an unspecified avian species and a turkey respectively. public s. derby isolate dp <dig> was isolated in  <dig> in denmark and was of clinical origin. s. derby isolate d <dig> was mlst typed as st <dig> which has been associated with the serovar s. agona, a serovar with a very similar antigenic formula to s. derby  <cit> . due to the probable mistyping of this isolate, d <dig> was removed from all further analysis.fig.  <dig> phenotypic and genotypic differences between s. derby and s. mbandaka isolates. a phylogenetic reconstruction of s. derby and s. mbandaka uk and public st types. uk isolations of s. mbandaka form one single clonal population with the public isolate mp <dig> clustering out from the group. whereas s. derby is formed of two distinct lineages, l <dig>  and l <dig> . the branch lengths represent the average number of snps per partition. bootstrap values are the mean of the prior probability densities for each node. the first  <dig> trees were discarded, the consensus tree was summarised from the remaining  <dig> trees, leaving an effective sample size of  <dig>  a stable solution of − <dig> and a standard error of the mean of  <dig> . bootstrap values are the mean of the prior probability densities, the branch lengths represent the average number snps per partition. b presence and absence of spi- <dig> genes and spi- <dig> region  <dig> and  <dig> in relation to a phylogenetic cladogram. all s. derby l <dig> isolates lack spi- <dig> region  <dig> and  <dig>  and contain a full version of spi- <dig>  l <dig> isolate d <dig> contains the spi- <dig> genes gene and docb as well as spi- <dig> region  <dig> and  <dig>  s. derby l <dig> isolates d <dig> and d <dig>  both contain spi- <dig> region  <dig> and  <dig> and lack all of spi- <dig> with the exception of docb.

distribution of spi- <dig> amongst uk isolates of s. derby and s. mbandaka
spi- <dig> was present in all s. derby l <dig> isolates whereas the island was completely missing from l <dig> isolates d <dig> and d <dig>  and all s. mbandaka isolates . the l <dig> isolate d <dig> contained the genes gene, tiny and docb .

diversity in biofilm formation amongst uk isolates of s. derby and s. mbandaka
after 48 h incubated at 25 °c all isolates of s. mbandaka, with the exception of m <dig>  formed a biofilm  and three, m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig> formed biofilms at 37 °c also. all l <dig> s. derby isolates formed biofilms at 25 °c, none of the l <dig> isolates formed biofilms at 25 °c. l <dig> isolate d <dig> was the only isolate of s. derby to form a biofilm at 37 °c.

association and invasion of ipec-j <dig> monolayers
porcine jejunum derived cell line, ipec-j <dig>  was used here as a porcine model for studying association to, and invasion of, porcine jejunum by representative isolates of s. derby l <dig> and l <dig>  and s. mbandaka. s. mbandaka isolate m <dig> associated to the monolayer in significantly greater numbers  than all isolates with the exception of s. derby d <dig> . s. derby d <dig> associates in significantly greater numbers  than l <dig> isolates and s. mbandaka isolates m <dig> and m <dig> with the exception of isolate d <dig>  s. derby d <dig> associated in greater numbers  to the monolayer than other l <dig> isolate d <dig> fig.  <dig> association and invasion assays. error bars represent +/-1sem, bars are coloured based on phylogenetic membership, l <dig> , l <dig>  and s. mbandaka . a association: there was no lineage or serovar level trend for association to ipec-j <dig> assays after 30 min of incubation at 37 °c. s. mbandaka m <dig> associated in significantly greater numbers to the monolayer then all other isolates . b invasion: s. derby l <dig> isolates d <dig> and d <dig> invaded in significantly greater numbers  then all other isolates. s. derby l <dig> and l <dig> isolate d <dig> invaded significantly fewer numbers than s. mbandaka and lineage  <dig> isolates



unlike the association assays, the proficiency of invasion differed between s. derby l <dig> and l <dig> . s. derby l <dig> isolates d <dig> and d <dig>  invaded the monolayers in significantly greater numbers  than all l <dig> isolates tested  with approximately  <dig> times as many cells internalised, as l <dig> isolate d <dig> and s. mbandaka isolates m <dig> and m <dig> with more than  <dig> times the number of internalised cells. s. mbandaka isolates m <dig> and m <dig> invaded in significantly greater numbers  than isolates d <dig>  d <dig>  d <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig> 

variability in utilisation of soybean and porcine jejunum and colon homogenates by s. derby and s. mbandaka isolates
for each homogenate, average respiratory rates for the three distinct lineages were produced, l <dig> , l <dig>  and s. mbandaka. when grown on soybean homogenate s. mbandaka isolates underwent a second period of respiration after the initial plateau phase . all s. derby and s. mbandaka isolates respired on porcine jejunum and colon homogenates . absorbance values on jejunum between lineages were not significantly different . whereas on porcine colon the respiratory rate for s. derby l <dig> diverged significantly  from l <dig> and s. mbandaka isolates by  <dig>  and 10 h respectively .fig.  <dig> respiratory dynamics measured through reduction of a tetrazolium dye. all values represent the averaging of  <dig> replicates of each isolate across a group; l <dig> , l <dig>  and s. mbandaka. a all strains respired on soybean homogenate, though after a period of stationary respiratory dynamics, s. mbandaka isolates underwent a second period of respiration. b there was no significant difference between dye intensity values of the three lineages on jejunum homogenate over the 24 h incubation period at 37 °c. c the dye intensity for s. derby l <dig> was significantly different  from that of l <dig> and s. mbandaka after  <dig>  and 10 h respectively, when incubated at 37 °c



discussion
in this study we performed several genotypic and phenotypic assays on  <dig> isolates of both s. derby and s. mbandaka isolated between  <dig> and  <dig> from across the uk. our data suggest that s. mbandaka isolations are part of a single clonal expansion whereas s. derby is composed of at least  <dig> sub-lineages. as might be anticipated, the phenotype will reflect the genotype of the lineages and our data from a variety of assays again suggested correspondence to the population structure determined through phylogenetic reconstruction. this was done to assign phenotypic properties to particular genovars of each serovar and we reason that the differential phenotypes may potentially represent adaptations that may in part explain why s. derby and s. mbandaka show different isolation rates from distinct sources.

population structure and host range
there is a large diversity in the epitopes of the surface antigens “o” and “h”  <cit> . studies have suggested that this diversity is the result of different environmentally derived selection pressures. the “o” antigen is recognised by a diverse range of host specific protozoan predators. as the compliment of protozoan varies amongst different host the selection pressure posed by the predators has driven the diversification of the “o” antigen  <cit> . the diversity between the two “h” phase antigens has been associated with immunogenicity  <cit> . it has been proposed that the ability to switch phase allows salmonella to escape detection by the adaptive immune response of the host that has developed in response to the initial phase epitope  <cit>  from the host environment, “o” the gut microflora and “h” the host’s immune system. we may therefore find convergent evolution towards certain epitopes, and therefore certain serogroups, as potential host adaptations. if this is the case, then the evolution of host adaptation amongst s. enterica isolates, cannot be studied at the serogroup level of classification alone; we must also have an understanding at the genovar level, to interpret the results of phenotypic studies in relation to host adaptation  <cit> . the results of phylogenetic reconstructions suggest that s. derby comprises at least two distinct lineages in the uk, with l <dig> associated with pigs and turkeys and l <dig> associated with turkeys. it would be interesting to test this hypothesis further by identifying the proportion of porcine and turkey isolates that belong to these two lineages across the uk. it is also evident from the inclusion of public isolates that s. derby l <dig> and l <dig> may also be found in north america whereas s. mbandaka in canada is not from the clonal complex observed in the uk and may include other lineages capable of colonising pigs. the clinical case of s. derby l <dig> in denmark opens up the intriguing question of; do the two distinct lineages both have the potential to cause disease in people?

the scale of phenotypic difference between the two lineages would suggest a high degree of genetic difference. we showed that a high number of snps had formed between the two s. derby lineages since their divergence. we previously estimated the divergence of s. derby d <dig> and d <dig> from s. mbandaka m <dig> and m <dig> at between 182kya and 625kya  <cit> . snp differences between l <dig> and l <dig> account for 67 % of the snps between s. derby and s. mbandaka. if we assume a constant substitution rate then we can estimate the split of the two lineages as occurring between 121kya and 419kya. whole genome alignment, snp analysis and estimation of the time since divergence between l <dig> isolate d <dig> and l <dig> isolates d <dig> and d <dig> is the aim of future work.

s. mbandaka isolates used in this study, and potentially all isolates of uk origin, come from a single lineage with no nucleotide polymorphisms across the seven house-keeping genes. though notably the public isolate mp <dig> did not cluster in with this clonal complex. the clonal lineage and the lack of s. mbandaka isolations from pigs in the uk suggests that mp <dig>  isolated from a pig in canada, may represent as separate lineage with the ability to infect other livestock species  <cit> . phenotypic and genotypic diversity amongst uk strains was low and it may be reasonably argued that isolates of this serovar are adapted to both cattle and chickens, or potentially the ex vivo environment, with no clear specialist lineage.

the presence of spi- <dig> and not spi- <dig> region  <dig> and  <dig> correlates with increased invasion of ipec-j <dig> monolayers
interestingly, there was little difference in numbers of cells associating to the porcine monolayer between s. derby l <dig> isolates and s. mbandaka. from these results it would appear that adhesion to porcine jejunal cells is not an adaptation directly contributing to the high prevalence of s. derby l <dig> in pigs.

s. derby l <dig> isolates d <dig> and d <dig>  possessing mlst type st <dig>  invaded ipec-j <dig> monolayers in significantly greater numbers than isolates from s. derby l <dig> and s. mbandaka m <dig> and m <dig>  conversely, isolate d <dig> from lineage  <dig>  possessing mlst type st <dig>  invaded the monolayers in similar numbers to s. derby l <dig> isolates. this isolate was of porcine origin suggesting that invasion may not be the only adaptation influencing s. derby prevalence amongst pigs. in previous work we have shown the same trend in invasion between s. derby d <dig> and d <dig>  and s. mbandaka m <dig> and m2; these strains have been included here as controls, but also to allow direct comparison with a wider population of isolates. s. derby d <dig> and d <dig> isolates both contain spi- <dig>  while s. mbandaka isolates m <dig> and m <dig> both lack spi- <dig>  <cit> . the island has been linked with tissue tropism, as it is highly up-regulated in the porcine jejunum and less so in the colon, and contains genes which are essential for adhesion to, and invasion of, ipec-j <dig> monolayers  <cit> . the absence of the same spi- <dig> genes in d <dig> would suggest that they were lost prior to divergence of s. derby l <dig> and that the remainder of spi- <dig> was likely lost from s. derby isolates d <dig> and d <dig> recently, over a time period in which no snps were formed at the mlst loci. it would also appear that spi- <dig> regions  <dig> and  <dig> were lost since the divergence of s. derby l <dig> from l <dig>  the development of a simple pcr for genes between goon and gene of spi- <dig> could be used as an epidemiological marker for distinguishing between l <dig> and l <dig> of s. derby. however, as we have not tested either lineage against a turkey cell line we cannot conclude if the absence of this island signifies a more turkey pathogenic strain but with such a pcr tool assigning lineage with host of isolation would be an interesting avenue to explore in future surveillance.

is s. mbandaka adapted towards environmental persistence?
all s. mbandaka isolates with the exception of m <dig> formed biofilms at 25 °c. s. mbandaka m <dig> and m <dig> were both previously shown to contain the gene scin, which is required by e. coli to form a biofilm  <cit> . it is reasonable to suggest that biofilm formation by s. derby l <dig> isolates at 25 °c appears to have been lost since the split from s. derby l <dig> 

s. mbandaka isolates underwent a second period of respiration on soybean homogenates at 25 °c which did not occur with s. derby isolates. this could reflect catabolite repression, and hence the ability of s. mbandaka to compete with s. derby for the same set of metabolites, until they are exhausted before utilising a second set of metabolites. we showed in previous work that s. mbandaka m <dig>  and not s. derby d <dig>  was able to respire at 25 °c on components of the soybean metabolome: d-saccharic acid, succinic acid, d-trehalose, mellibiose, methyl succinate and fumaric acid  <cit> . it is possible that s. mbandaka initially uses the same components as s. derby, until they are exhausted, at which point they begin to use other components potentially including the above mentioned metabolites.

biofilm formation and more proficient use of soybean metabolites, suggest that s. mbandaka is better adapted to survival in the farm environment, potentially persisting in biofilms, using a greater number of soybean metabolites, a common ingredient in animal feed in the uk  <cit> . this may provide an explanation for the reduced level of antibiotic resistance amongst s. mbandaka strains  <cit>  suggesting persistence in the external farm environment. this could present a model for niche partitioning where one population is better adapted to colonising and persisting in the host and the other adapted to persisting and growing in the external environment: an intriguing hypothesis worthy of further study.

CONCLUSIONS
further to our previous studies we here extend observations pertaining to potential host adaptations possessed by s. derby and s. mbandaka, made on just  <dig> strains, to a selection of isolations made from across the uk between  <dig> and  <dig>  the results of phylogenetic reconstruction, based on concatemers of mlst sequences, showed that uk isolates of s. mbandaka were clonal and s. derby isolates were members of at least two lineages. the results of pcr, biofilm, invasion and respiratory assays support our developing hypothesis that s. derby and s. mbandaka are adapted to separate niches, in vivo within a porcine host and ex vivo in animal feed, respectively. further larger-scale studies are required to determine if the results of the current work apply to all isolations of these serovars.
