BACKGROUND
recent development of high throughput profiling methods such as microarray, rna-seq and chromatin immuno-precipitation followed by microarray  or sequencing  have revolutionized the study of protein–dna interactions and have made information regarding gene expression and transcription factor binding sites  readily available. positional binding of transcription factors  can vary from the basal promoter region to a few kilobase pairs from the transcription start site . when a tf is bound to the promoter region, experimental evidence suggests an increased probability of the gene being its target, but the functional nature of the tfbs would be difficult to characterise based upon the tfbs profile alone. therefore, the task of associating tfbs with a gene is not trivial. traditionally, identified tfbs have been associated with the nearest gene  <cit> . however, the effect of functional tfbs can be observed in a target’s gene expression, and therefore integration of chip-seq profiles with gene expression is crucial for identification of active binding sites. there have been several previous attempts at dataset integration, some of which have tried to apply regression based models  <cit> , while some have validated the chip-seq identified targets by transcriptionally silencing the tf and observing the effect on gene expression  <cit> . whilst most of the methodology developed for integrating the two datasets considers genomic attributes from the chip-seq dataset, none of the methods are based on the tf’s interacting partners or interactome.

the function and efficiency of a tf is often modulated by its interaction with other proteins to achieve finely tuned regulation of gene expression. tf complexes can be inferred by assessing significant enrichment of motif spacing within chip-seq peaks  <cit> . such tf complexes are often referred to as cis-regulatory modules. several studies have tried to develop computational frameworks for the identification of relevant tf complexes for co-expressed genes  <cit> , and it has been previously established that if genes are under a common regulatory mechanism they tend to follow similar expression patterns. in this study, we have developed a computational framework which enables integration of the tf-complex obtained from a chip-seq genome-wide tf binding profile with gene expression profiles.

we have devised and tested the new framework using a rat model for crescentic glomerulonephritis . crgn is an important cause of kidney failure, for which the underlying molecular basis is largely unknown. the wistar-kyoto  rat is uniquely susceptible to experimentally induced crgn  <cit> . we previously investigated the genetic basis to crgn susceptibility in crosses between the crgn-sensitive wky and the crgn-resistant lewis  rat strains. crgn was linked to  <dig> quantitative trait loci  including the chromosome  <dig> qtl crgn <dig>  in which the ap- <dig> transcription factor jund was identified as a primary determinant of macrophage activation and associated with crgn susceptibility  <cit> . wky bone marrow-derived macrophages  demonstrated marked overexpression of jund and increased fc receptor-mediated macrophage activation compared with bmdms from lew and from congenic rats  in which the lew crgn <dig> qtl was introgressed onto the wky background. therefore, characterisation of jund’s physical and genetic interactions may provide key insights into complex biological systems. in our previous study, we have shown that jund is a regulator of oxidative stress and il <dig> beta synthesis in macrophages  <cit> .

in this study, by characterising the jund interactome and modelling gene expression data, we have identified a group of genes that show differential co-expression and enrichment during lps stimulation between wky and the wky.lcrgn <dig> congenic strain. our data also suggests that interaction of jund with specific tfs could be important for the over-activation phenomenon of macrophages in the wky strain. this work suggests that the jund complex has modulatory effects on macrophage gene expression which provides the basis for understanding jund-mediated macrophage activation, and enabling identification of novel targets for modulating macrophage function.

methods
chip-seq and gene expression data
bone-marrow derived macrophages  were isolated from wky and wky.lcrgn <dig>  bmdms were subjected to lps stimulation . gene expression profiles were generated using rat gene  <dig>  st arrays  at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 8 hours after lps stimulation using  <dig> biological replicates for each time point. sample pre-processing and hybridisation was performed as per manufacturer’s recommendations. the affymetrix .cel files were imported to r statistical software version  <dig> , using r affy package version  <dig> . probe annotation was done using custom chip definition files  <cit> , and probesets with single nucleotide polymorphisms between brown norway  rat strains and wky rat strains were removed. background correction was performed using robust multichip average   <cit>  and data was normalised using the quantile normalisation method. differential expression analysis was performed using the bioconductor package samr, which implements sam  statistics in r  <cit> , and a cut-off of 5% false discovery rate  was applied.

genome-wide jund tf binding profiles were generated for wky and wky.lcrgn <dig> at two initial time-points. chip was performed with a jund antibody  and a negative igg control . chip-seq peaks were predicted using bayespeak version  <dig>   <cit> , and predicted peaks with a posterior probability greater than  <dig>  were considered significant .

motif analysis
de novo and known tfbss were identified using the homer software package version  <dig>  <cit> . de novo motif analysis was performed using default parameters expecting a 12 bp motif. tfbs were identified using the area underneath the chip-seq peaks using the publically available software transfac transcription factor matrices version  <dig>  <cit> .

inferences of tf targets using gene expression data
tf complexes were inferred using the methodology described in  <cit> . the primary focus of banerjee et al. was tfbs in promoter regions. in this study we have extended this methodology to the area under predicted chip-seq peaks. a tf pair was considered to be co-operativly interacting if the expression correlation scores of genes showing binding of both tfs were significantly greater than any set of genes with binding of either tf alone. we used the proposed model based on the multivariate hypergeometric distribution.

tf targets using chip-seq data
spaced motif analysis was carried out using the spamo software  <cit> . in brief, the spamo algorithm predicts transcription factor interactions by assessing significant enrichment of motif spacings within the chip-seq peaks. primary and secondary motifs for the motif spacing analysis were retrieved from the public transfac database  <cit> . here we have used a window of 50 bp on either side of the primary motif to look for significant enrichment of motif spacings with a secondary motif. all reported p-values were adjusted for the number of intervals and motifs tested using the bonferroni correction.

integration of gene expression with chip-seq profiles
ap- <dig> complex tf gene expression profiles were modelled based on the gaussian process differential equations  <cit> . this methodology was specifically developed to model short time-series datasets and is implemented in tigre, r package  <cit> . this was used for ranking the expressed set of transcripts on the microarray based on the similarity of the gene expression profiles represented in the form of likelihood scores. the ranked sets of transcripts were subjected to gene set enrichment analysis using likelihood scores based on a pre-ranked list and spamo identified tf-pair target genes as datasets  <cit> . a dataset was considered significant if it had a family wise error rate  <  <dig> .

RESULTS
identification of jund-enriched sites by chip-seq and characterisation of targets
genome-wide chromatin occupancy by jund was determined in wky and wky.lcrgn <dig> bmdms for the basal resting state and after 2 hrs of lps stimulation. the chip-seq peaks were identified using bayespeak  <cit>  with a significance threshold of 90% posterior probability. for bmdms with the higher levels of jund expression in the wky strain, we identified  <dig>   and  <dig>   peaks, while for the wky.lcrgn <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  peaks were detected for the basal and lps stimulated datasets respectively. de novo motif analysis as well as investigation of known jund tfbs showed significant enrichment of jund motifs in all  <dig> datasets de novo motif analysis showed an enrichment p-values of  <dig> e- <dig>   <dig> e- <dig> and  <dig> e- <dig> for wky basal, wky lps and wky.lcrgn <dig> basal conditions respectively. while enrichment analysis for the known ap <dig> motif showed an enrichment p-values of  <dig> e- <dig>   <dig> e- <dig>   <dig> e- <dig> and 6e- <dig> for wky basal, lps and wky.lcrgn <dig> basal, lps stimulated conditions respectively  <cit> . reads that mapped to chip-seq peaks, irrespective of condition or strain were clustered using correlation, showing that the chip-seq profiles obtained were able to distinguish wky from wky.lcrgn <dig> irrespective of lps stimulation . within clusters the correlation was > <dig>  while across the clusters correlation was considerably lower . identified peaks were mapped to the nearest gene’s tss within a window spanning ±20 kb. this resulted in the identification of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> transcripts for wky basal, lps, wky.lcrgn <dig> basal and lps datasets respectively . the transcript associated peaks were validated in triplicate an independent set of rats and we were able to validate 78% of the randomly selected peaks  <cit> . the number of transcripts associated with the peaks increases after lps stimulation in the case of wky while it decreases in the case of wky.lcrgn <dig>  suggesting a diminished role of jund-driven activity in wky.lcrgn <dig> during lps stimulation. this observation is also consistent with the increase in jund expression levels following lps stimulation as shown previously and reported in  <cit> .

inferring tf interactions with jund using gene expression data
jund belongs to the ap- <dig> family of transcription factors and it is well established that most of the members form homo as well as hetero dimers with other family members  <cit> . jund, when forming homo or hetero dimers with the jun family of proteins, prefers binding to the 7-mer phorbol 12-o-tetradecanoate-13-acetate -responsive element  motif tgatca; while it binds to 8-mer camp-responsive element  motifs tgacgtca when it forms hetero dimers with members of the atf family   <cit> . a chip experiment will precipitate the tf as well as the whole tf complex bound to a genomic region. to infer the interaction between two tfs using gene expression data a method has been developed based upon the hypothesis that if two tfs act cooperatively they both should bind to the promoter of their target genes, and the common targets of the two tfs should be more correlated compared to their binding alone   <cit> . we tested this hypothesis in wky and wky.lcrgn <dig> using lps chip-seq peaks binding in the promoter region of genes  , and determined whether known, experimentally verified, non-ap- <dig> interacting partners of jund  can be inferred using similarity of gene expression profiles  <cit> . a multivariate hyper-geometric test confirmed that these tfs co-operatively interact in wky while in wky.lcrgn <dig> the interaction was impaired . this supports the usefulness of gene expression data to detect interacting tfs, and suggests that the reduction in jund’s expression level not only decreases the number of peaks in the congenic but also reduces jund’s interaction with other tfs.

inferring genome-wide tf-interactions with jund using chip-seq data
jund’s co-operative interacting partners for the wky lps datasets were predicted on the basis of co-occurrence of binding site motifs within chip-seq peaks using spamo  <cit> . this was investigated in wky where we observed a higher number of peaks in response to lps stimulation as compared with wky.lcrgn <dig> , which had also  <dig> fold less jund expression. where tre and cre ap- <dig> motifs were used as primary motifs, we identified  <dig>  and  <dig>  secondary transfac motifs respectively, representing  <dig> and  <dig> tfs respectively , including ~50% known interacting tfs and suggesting widespread tf-interactions with jund.

combining gene expression profiling with tf-targets identified by chip-seq analysis
we aim to characterise genome-wide direct targets of jund, and ap- <dig> complexes that are driven by jund. to investigate the mrna activity of the targets of jund complexes we focused on ap- <dig> family members that were represented on the microarray: jund, junb, c-jun, jdp <dig>  jdp <dig>  fos, fosl <dig>  atf <dig> and b-atf. we used gene set enrichment analysis   <cit>  to test whether the target genes of tf partners interacting with jund  are overrepresented amongst the tf-targets that were predicted based on the similarity of expression profiles with ap- <dig> tfs . since there is  <dig> fold less jund expression in wky.lcrgn <dig>  we considered only wky lps for identification of tf-target genes by chip-seq analysis. lps time course expression data in wky and wky.lcrgn <dig> were used to predict tf targets based on the tf expression profile . tfs interacting with jund family members that were detected by the gsea analysis are reported in figure  <dig> and additional file 3: table s <dig> 

integrative analysis of chip-seq peaks containing tre motif targets of the jun family members and their gene expression resulted in the identification of  <dig> unique gene sets, corresponding to  <dig> tfs. these were significantly enriched in wky, but none of them were enriched in wky.lcrgn <dig> at 5% fwer . twelve out of the sixteen gene-sets  were specifically associated with jund and corresponded to ten interacting tfs.

the cre motif is the preferred motif for atf homo and hetero dimers . the integrative analysis of the atf family of tfs identified only two gene-sets to be significantly enriched in wky.lcrgn <dig> while  <dig> gene-sets  showed significant enrichment in wky . potential interaction of the identified tfs with jund or atf <dig> were validated using manual and recently published protein interaction information extraction   <cit>  search and have identified that 74%  of the putative jund-atf <dig> interacting partners were previously known to interact with either jund or atf <dig> . altogether, these results suggest that the interaction of tfs with jund and the regulation of target genes upon lps stimulation are affected by jund genotype as demonstrated by the reduced jund expression and impaired tf interactions in wky.lcrgn <dig> 

transcriptional response to lps stimulation
we identified genes differentially expressed  due to lps stimulation by comparing genome-wide expression profiles at each time point with respect to the basal state. at 5% false discovery rate ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes were differentially expressed in wky at  <dig>  and 8 hour time points respectively; while a similar number of significantly differentially expressed genes was observed in wky.lcrgn <dig> . we investigated the efficacy of the lps treatment in rat bmdm by analysing the transcriptional response of a set of established primary and secondary response genes, previously identified in the mouse by ramirez-carrozzi et al.  <cit> . consistent with the mouse data, we found significant up-regulation of both primary and secondary response genes at initial time-points of the lps treatment in wky and wky.lcrgn <dig> strains . to explore how lps stimulation affects the transcriptional regulation of target genes of jund and interacting tf partners, for each time point of the lps time course we performed over-representation analysis of inferred jund target genes within the de genes. to distinguish between activation and repression activity of jund interacting tf partners, the over-representation test was carried out separately for up- and down-regulated target genes . for the predicted targets of the jun/ap- <dig> complex , we found significant enrichment only for the hnf4/dr <dig> tf, where its target genes were de at the 4 hr time point . a similar enrichment analysis was performed for the atf family , which showed  <dig> gene-sets  as specifically enriched amongst the set of up-regulated genes in wky . this is consistent with atf <dig> binding as a homo-dimer and acting as a repressor of transcription but in a hetero-dimer with jund it acts as an activator of the transcription  <cit> . no significant enrichments were observed in wky.lcrgn <dig> for both ap- <dig> and atf tfs interacting with jund. these results suggest that atf interaction with jund might be important for macrophage activation in wky, with the most significant transcriptional changes occurring at 4 hrs post lps stimulation.

top-ten most significantly enriched interacting tf at 4 hrs wky time-point is listed here, for complete list please refer to additional file 8: table s <dig>  ns, p >  <dig> .

combining all jun/ap- <dig> and atf target genes, we delineated a large set of  <dig>  transcripts  that were found to be over-represented in the wky de gene dataset , but not in wky.lcrgn <dig> . this over-representation was due to  <dig> genes that were up-regulated in wky at the 4 hr lps time point, and these were significantly enriched for gene ontology terms including immune response , antigen processing and presentation  as well as terms linked to morphogenesis  and vessel development  . taken together, these data identify a set of tfs that interact with jund and their regulated target genes in wky upon lps stimulation. this regulatory network centred on jund, and the interacting tfs is schematically summarised in figure  <dig> 

discussion
identification of functionally active tf targets in specific cell type can provide insights into crucial biological processes, which might underlie the patho-physiology of disease. a genome-wide tf binding profile can be obtained by chip-seq analysis and, based on the definition of the gene promoter length, chip-seq peaks can be associated with the nearest gene’s tss  <cit> . however, association of the tfbs to the nearest gene tss is not sufficient to establish the downstream gene as a tf target since the tfbs might not be active in a given cell-type or cell-activation status  <cit> . hence, the characterization of active tfbs and functionally active tf-target genes in a specific cellular context remains to be elucidated. in this study we aimed to identify functional tfbs by integrating tf targets identified by chip-seq analysis with tf target activity that was predicted using gene expression data. we developed a computational framework for the integrative analysis and implemented it in a rat model for crgn, where we focus on the jund tf which has been previously shown to be a primary determinant of macrophage activation  <cit> . the congenic model  has been comprehensively tested in previous studies where they have shown that the jund expression levels are significantly higher in wky when compared with the congenic  <cit>  and by performing transam assay it has been shown that the canonical binding of ap- <dig> is significantly greater in wky compared to wky.lcrgn <dig> <cit> . the aim of this study is to characterise the direct targets of jund complexes in wky and its differential function in wky.lcrgn <dig> during macrophage activation.

after lps stimulation, due to changes in the jund expression levels between wky and wky.lcrgn <dig> the number of jund chip-seq peaks as well as interactions of ap- <dig> with other tf was impaired. these observations suggest that jund plays an active role during macrophage activation in wky while its role is diminished in the congenic strain. the ap- <dig> family has been implicated in macrophage activation  <cit> , and here we were interested in characterising the role of jund driven ap- <dig> complexes during macrophage activation. ap- <dig> complexes can be broadly be classified into jun and atf families. jund is capable of forming homo as well as hetero dimers: when forming hetero dimers with the jun/fos family it prefers the tre motif, while with the atf family it prefers cre motifs. however, by sequence analysis of tf binding motifs, it is not possible to sub-classify the members of ap- <dig> families, since they recognise the same tf binding motifs. so, each member of the jun/fos and atf families was considered separately for investigation of target gene expression using microarrays. we have modelled the gene expression profiles of the tfs and their targets to estimate the likelihood of a transcript to be a target of jund/ap- <dig> complexes. moreover, using spaced motif analysis, jund interacting partners were predicted, ~50% of which were previously experimentally validated .

considering the differences in the physiological levels of jund between wky and wky.lcrgn <dig>  it can be anticipated that the chip-seq derived tf target data should be more concordant with the gene expression based tf’s targets in wky compared to wky.lcrgn <dig>  the hnf4/dr <dig> was the only gene-set that showed an enrichment with the 4 hr up-regulated significantly differentially expressed genes during wky and not in wky.lcrgn <dig>  interestingly, the entire jun family member showed enrichment with hnf4/dr <dig>  suggesting that hnf <dig> might be important for macrophage activation. hnf <dig> has been previously linked to chemokine induced inflammatory response  <cit>  and lipid metabolism.

the atf family also showed an exclusive enrichment for  <dig> out of  <dig> gene-sets in wky, while only  <dig> gene-sets were observed to be significantly enriched in wky.lcrgn <dig>  this is not unexpected, considering that the congenic has lower expression of jund. although the gene-set enrichment was not exclusive to wky, fisher’s exact test for  <dig> gene-sets showed exclusive enrichment with wky up-regulated genes during macrophage activation at the 4 hour lps time point. this analysis led to the identification of  <dig> genes that showed an enrichment of go terms associated with antigen processing and presentation, signalling cascades and nucleic acid metabolic processes. atf’s interaction with jund in the context of macrophage activation has not been studied in depth. a previous study has shown that their interaction regulates the chemokine rantes , which is critical for macrophage activation  <cit> . this suggests that atf <dig> and/or b-atf could be important for wky macrophage activation.

atf <dig> primarily acts as a transcriptional repressor but when it forms a hetero dimer with jund it acts as an activator of transcription  <cit> . atf <dig> has been previously hypothesised to be a global regulator of macrophage activation  <cit> . it has been shown before that atf <dig> is up-regulated early after lps induced toll-like receptor  engagement which together with nf-κb constitutes a negative feedback mechanism to down regulate tlr  <cit> . although gilchrist et al. observed over-representation of atf <dig>  ap- <dig> and nf-κb target genes, they primarily focused on the co-operative interaction of atf <dig> with nf-κb. hence, the role of atf <dig> in the context of jund was not studied in detail. with our integrated analysis however, we have identified direct targets of the atf3-jund complex that might be important for macrophage activation.

b-atf is another member of the atf family that is induced in t cells and natural killer cells upon stimulation and is a proposed to be a therapeutic target for immunotherapies. it has also been shown to be critical for the th <dig> cell inflammatory immune response  <cit> , contrary to the belief that b-atf is a suppressor of ap- <dig> gene expression  <cit> .

the atf-jund hetero-dimer was observed to be associated with  <dig> tfs and their targets were significantly enriched in the 4 hr lps time-point comparison with the basal state while targets for  <dig> tfs were observed to be enriched in the 8 hrs time-point comparison. this suggests that hetero-dimer interaction of jund with atf family members might be more important during macrophage activation than the hetero-dimers formed with the jun family.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we have developed a methodology not only to predict direct targets for tfs but also to infer functional co-operative interactions. in this study we have only considered the ap- <dig> complex, but this can be applied to any tf complex. by combining gene expression data with chip-seq profiles we have identified  <dig>  genes which are directly associated with jund and have shown their involvement during macrophage activation. considering that jund is a gene with major differential expression between wky and wky.lcrgn <dig>  these  <dig>  genes are likely to be direct targets of jund. our data suggests interplay of jund with the atf family and hnf <dig> during macrophage activation, which was previously unappreciated. further study of the interplay between these two tfs will provide the basis for understanding jund-mediated macrophage activation, enabling identification of novel targets for modulating macrophage function.
