BACKGROUND
there are many mechanisms by which plants regulate gene expression to ensure normal development and appropriate responses to both biotic and abiotic signals. one regulatory mechanism involves endogenous small rna  molecules, 20~24-nt in length  <cit> , which act by silencing gene expression. in plants, srnas have been classified based on their biogenesis, including micrornas , heterochromatic sirnas , trans-acting sirnas  and natural antisense sirnas   <cit> . tasirna biogenesis from tas loci depends on mirna-directed cleavage of their transcripts  <cit>  and three tasirna pathways have been characterized in arabidopsis <cit> . although mirnas only constitute a small fraction in the srna population  <cit> , the mirna-guided post-transcriptional gene regulation is one of the most conserved and well-characterized gene regulatory mechanisms  <cit> . increasing evidence shows that mirnas negatively regulate their target genes, which function in a wide range of biological processes, including organogenesis, signal transduction and stress responses  <cit> .

mirnas are derived from a precursor sequence of ~ <dig> bases that usually forms a 21 bp duplex with a conserved stem and variable loops which is excised to produce the mature mirna. the 21 bp sequence matches one or more target sequences for cleavage  <cit> . mirnas were initially identified by direct cloning with bioinformatic prediction or sanger sequencing of relatively small-sized cdna libraries  <cit> . the application of deep sequencing has greatly facilitated the pace of mirna identification in plants. in addition to arabidopsis and rice  <cit> , mirnas have been identified in many other plant species, including poplar  <cit> , tomato  <cit> , maize  <cit> , grape  <cit> , peanut  <cit>  and soybean  <cit> . comparative analysis reveals that some of the mirna families are highly conserved among all plant species while others have diverged and evolved, generating abundant family- and species-specific mirnas  <cit> . these dynamic and evolving mirnas could serve as a driving force for the selection of improved and novel traits in plants.

peach  is a model species for genomics studies in the rosaceae family, which includes a number of economically important fruit tree species such as apple, cherry and plum. it has a relatively small and well annotated genome , diploid, and there are numerous est sequences. peach have a number of unique biological facets not commonly found in model organisms such as a 3–5 year juvenility period before the trees flower and fruit  <cit> . in addition, as temperate zone plants, the reproductive cycle is one year with flower buds initiating during the previous summer. they enter dormancy triggered by cold weather and/or short photoperiod in the fall, and continue developing when released by the seasonal accumulation of chilling stimulus to bloom in the spring  <cit> . another distinct feature of peach fruit relative to arabidopsis is the formation of fleshy fruit with hardened endocarp or stone surrounding the seed. stone formation is closely coordinated with fruit development  <cit> . lastly, peach can be productive for several decades under changing conditions in the orchard. conceivably, all these developmental programs require an array of sophisticated regulatory networks, involving numerous players presumably including mirnas.

recently, zhang et al.  <cit>  initiated the exploration of mirnas in peach by computationally identifying  <dig> mirnas and experimentally verifying mirnas for seven conserved mirna families. we wanted to know if peach has evolved novel mirnas to correspond with its potentially novel development and growth, and what their targets are. to address this, we performed a comprehensive analysis of peach mirnas from different tissues by deep sequencing, computational prediction, and molecular approaches. we were able to identify novel and conserved peach mirnas as well as their targets. a majority of the mirnas showed tissue-specific expression and 16% of them were found to be regulated at the post-transcriptional level. in addition, peach conserves two of the three trans-acting sirna pathways and we identified additional protein-coding transcripts as tasirna biogenesis loci.

RESULTS
srna population in peach
four cdna libraries made from peach root, leaf, flower and mixed fruit srnas yielded  <dig> million high quality reads. among  <dig> million unique reads, ranging from 15- to 31-nt, 70% were perfectly matched to at least one locus in the peach genome . these reads were used for further analysis . the 20~24-nt srnas constituted over 90% of the identified peach srnas, and the 24-nt class of srnas was the most abundant class in all tissues . the redundant 24-nt srnas were more abundant in flower and mixed fruit than in root and leaf, and the redundant 21-nt srnas were more highly expressed in root than other tissues . notably, the expression of the unique 24-nt srnas was much higher than the 21-nt class in all tissues, especially in root .

known mirna families and their expression in peach
to identify known mirna families in peach, we blasted all srna sequences against mirbase . a total of  <dig> unique srna sequences  were identified belonging to  <dig> mirna families that are conserved in both angiosperms and coniferophyta lineages  <cit>  and referred to as conserved mirnas in this study. these conserved mirnas varied greatly in expression levels . in addition, most conserved mirna families showed differential expression among root, leaf, flower and mixed fruit tissues. an additional eighty-three mirna sequences belonged to  <dig> mirna families  that have been identified and reported in at least one plant species or family  <cit> . these are referred to as less-conserved mirnas in this work. a canonical predicted stem-loop structure could be identified in seven of the  <dig> less-conserved mirna families . overall, all the less-conserved mirnas displayed relatively low expression levels compared to the conserved mirnas except for mir <dig>  and they, like the conserved mirnas, displayed differential expression among tissues .

a random subset of the conserved and less-conserved mirnas was analyzed with rna blot to validate the expression data from the deep sequencing, utilizing mir <dig> as a standard . the tissue-specific expression patterns were presented for the conserved mirnas, mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  and the less-conserved mirnas, mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> .

peach-specific mirnas
after excluding srna reads homologous to known mirnas and other non-coding rnas, the remaining 20~22-nt srna reads were selected for secondary structure prediction. those with canonical stem-loop structures and sequence specificity  were considered as putative new mirnas . in total,  <dig> srnas from  <dig> loci were identified.  <dig> of these srnas qualified as novel peach mirnas since their star stands were identified and the remaining  <dig> srnas without star strand detected were classified as candidate peach mirnas . collectively, we refer to them as peach-specific mirnas as they at present have only been found in peach. of the  <dig> peach-specific mirnas,  <dig> were 21-nt,  <dig> were 22-nt, and one was 20-nt . thirty-eight of the mirnas were transcribed from single loci and the remaining nine matched  <dig> to  <dig> loci. approximately 67% of the peach-specific mirnas mapped to the sense strand of genome scaffolds while only 33% of them mapped to the antisense strand .

aonly a single mapped scaffold is shown here. all matched scaffolds are included in additional file 6: table s <dig>  brpm, reads per million.

the expression of all peach-specific mirnas was analyzed and compared by both srna-seq and rna blot analyses. in general, peach-specific mirnas had low expression which varied in different tissues . we detected signals for  <dig> of the  <dig> peach-specific mirnas by rna blot analyses in one or all seven tissues tested, and the hybridization signal intensity was, in general, correlated with the reads per million  values as demonstrated for mirc <dig> and mirc <dig> with some exceptions .

detection of mirna precursors and tissue- and development-specific differential processing in peach
in plants, mirna transcription and processing appear to be closely coupled as the transcripts are immediately processed  <cit> . this appeared to hold true for most of the peach mirnas we analyzed. however, in the case of nine mirnas, mirc <dig>  mirc <dig>  mirc <dig>  mirc <dig>  mirc <dig>  mirc <dig>  mirc <dig>  mirc <dig> and mirc <dig>  two fragments were detected by rna blot analyses; one corresponding to the expected 21~22-nt mirna species and the other corresponding to rna species ranging from  <dig> to 130-nt in size, which is the predicted size range of most mirna precursors. to assess if these large fragment were mirna precursors, we designed two 21-nt oligo probes  complementary only with non-mirna sequences within stem loops of the selected mirc <dig> and mirc <dig> . these probes should detect only the large fragment because they were not complementary with the mirna sequences. indeed, only the large fragment was detected with each of these probes . re-probing the same blot with another mirna did not detect the large fragment, indicating that it was not an artifact . therefore, the detected large fragments likely represented mirna transcript precursors.

a comparison between large and small fragment intensity among tissues revealed that their relative ratios varied among tissues. for example, mirc <dig> was more abundant than its precursor in young fruit  while the opposite was true in bark tissue . these findings suggest that these mirnas are differentially processed in different tissues. to compare mirna processing efficiency, we quantified both small and large fragment signal intensity and calculated the percentage of the small fragment intensity relative to the total fragment intensity , as listed in bottom panels of figure 3a,b. the ape for both mirc <dig> and mirc <dig> showed substantial variations among tissues, as over 80% of transcript precursors were processed in flower , root  and bark  but only 11% was processed in young fruit  for mirc <dig> . similarly, 63% of mirc <dig> precursors was processed in young fruit  while as little as 5% was processed in bark tissue . in addition to tissue-specific regulation, mirna processing was also influenced by fruit development stage as the ape for mirc <dig> increased from 11% to 92% during development from young fruit  to mature fruit   while an opposite trend was observed for mirc <dig> . apparently, the expression of these peach mirnas was subjected to differential processing regulation in a tissue-specific and development-dependent fashion.

mirnas in plants are primarily regulated at the transcriptional level. we quantified the changes in transcription of the specific mirnas among tissues by relative transcription activity  of mirc <dig> and mirc <dig>  in regard to mir <dig> as the loading control. specifically, mirc <dig> had the highest rta in flower  and the lowest rta in young fruit , while mirc <dig> had the highest rta in young fruit  and the lowest rta in bark  . mirna transcription and processing shared similar activity in some tissues but different in other tissues, indicating that the two regulatory mechanisms could be uncoupled.

identification of mirna targets in peach
we identified  <dig> target genes for known mirnas through sequencing of a peach degradome library and found that most of them were abundantly represented as conserved mirna targets . thirty-five target genes were identified for  <dig> of the conserved mirna families, and  <dig> target genes for the nine less-conserved mirna families. the target transcripts were then classified into five categories  based on their abundance   <cit> . ten targets for the conserved mirnas fell into the category  <dig>  the most abundant, and half of the targets fell into category  <dig>  we could not identify any targets for some conserved mirna families regardless of whether the expression level of the corresponding mirnas was low or high, indicating there is no clear correlation between mirna level and the efficiency of cleavage of its target transcript.

a large number of the identified targets were members of transcription factor gene families, including spl, myb, arf, nac and grf, while others were related to srna binding , auxin signaling , sulfate transport  and redox reactions  . for a given mirna with multiple conserved target transcripts, the frequency of each target in the degradome varied. more importantly, novel targets were also identified for at least two conserved mirnas, i.e. mir <dig> and mir <dig>  the mir <dig> target encodes a rho guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor and the two mir <dig> targets encode a selenium-binding protein and a d-type cyclin . we also identified either single or multiple targets for the nine less-conserved mirnas in peach . both mir <dig> and mir <dig> targeted myb family genes. mir <dig> could cleave three myb genes while mir <dig> targeted  <dig>  among which they shared one common target. in addition, mir <dig> was found to target two other genes both encoding peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-coa thiolases that have critical roles in fatty acid metabolism  <cit>  . notably, mir <dig> had the most gene targets identified in this study.

a total of  <dig> targets were identified for  <dig> of the peach-specific mirnas . among the identified targets, only one fell into category 0; eight into category  <dig> and seven into category  <dig> or  <dig> . mirc6a and mirc6b shared two of three gene targets identified while mirc <dig> and mirc <dig> targeted the same gene transcript. mirc <dig> and mirc <dig> target different genes while mirc <dig> and mirc <dig> target two genes from the same gene family. the other four peach-specific mirnas were found to target single genes. the identified  <dig> gene targets encode diverse proteins including zinc finger, nbs-lrr class disease resistance, ppr containing, protein kinase, far1-related, rna binding, catalase and vernalization-related proteins , suggesting that these peach-specific mirnas are likely involved in regulation of a wide range of biological processes or metabolic pathways.

trans-acting sirnas in peach
in this study, we found that both mir390-tas <dig> and mir828-tas <dig> tasirna pathways are conserved in peach as evidenced by the identification of mir <dig> and mir <dig>  tas <dig> and tas <dig> transcripts and the generation of phased 21-nt sirnas along both tas <dig> and tas <dig> transcripts . rna blot analysis showed that both mir <dig> and mir <dig> had detectable expression in various peach tissues . mir390's cleavage target, a tas <dig> ortholog  was identified in peach, and shared similar dual mir <dig> target sites with its arabidopsis counterpart. mapping of srna reads against pptas <dig> defined a similar tasirna generation region and pattern between these dual target sites. mostly 21-nt tasirnas were generated in the flower tissue , which correlated with flower-specific expression of mir <dig> . of these sirna populations, two sirnas shared > 95% sequence identity with the characterized arabidopsis tasiarfs, which were shown to target atarf2atarf <dig>  and atarf <dig> that negatively regulate auxin signaling  <cit> . our degradome analysis also showed that these two peach tasiarfs targeted two arf transcription factors  , indicating functional conservation in peach.

a peach tas <dig> ortholog, defined as pptas <dig>  was also identified. its transcript bore a mir <dig> signature binding site at the 5' end with a similar sirna biogenesis pattern  and pptas <dig> sirna was preferentially produced in the leaf and flower . one of tas4-derived sirnas, tas4-sirna, shared extensive sequence identity with its arabidopsis counterpart which has been shown to target at least three mybs that up-regulate anthocyanin production  <cit> . our degradome analysis did not identify any target for the peach tas4-sirna, but in silico analysis predicted at least two mybs  as targets for peach tas4-sirna. these predicted myb targets are closely related to atmyb <dig> which is targeted by arabidopsis tas4-sirna  <cit> .

multiple mirna targeting of myb transcription factors with diverse functions in peach
in arabidopsis, mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> target at least  <dig> myb genes  <cit> . our degradome data found that these three mirnas collectively targeted  <dig> mybs in peach . however, considering that the mirna target number was underestimated, due to no or low expression of target genes in the specific tissues, it is likely that more myb gene targets exist. therefore, we performed in silico target prediction and identified an additional three, nine and  <dig> myb genes for mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  respectively, with an align score of less than  <dig>  thus, a total of  <dig> myb target genes were found, four for mir <dig>   <dig> for mir <dig> and  <dig> for mir <dig>  mir <dig> shared five targeted mybs with mir <dig> and two with mir <dig> . most myb genes that we confirmed or predicted as mirna targets belonged to the r2r3-myb class, sharing a similar genomic organization with a conserved 5' region and a divergent region at the 3' end . further analysis revealed that mir <dig> and mir <dig> target sites were separated by  <dig> nucleotides and co-located in the conserved region of the third exon while the mir <dig> target site was located in the divergent region of the co-targeted mybs . furthermore, we found that the mir828-cleaved transcripts of three mybs underwent phased 21-nt sirna biogenesis production . these three myb transcripts shared similar mir <dig> cleavage positions, tasirna generation regions and patterns, intron-exon structure and sequence conservation . the produced tasirnas displayed quite different tissue specificity; the majority of ppa024533m-derived tasirnas were found in root, the majority of ppa016135m-derived tasirnas were primarily in leaf and ppa010908m-derived tasirnas were distributed mostly in fruit .

a large number of r2r <dig> myb genes comprising  <dig> subgroups have been functionally characterized in arabidopsis <cit> . accordingly, we did a phylogenetic analysis for all the mirna-targeted peach myb genes and found that of the four mir159-targeted mybs, one was in myb subgroup  <dig> - anther and pollen development; another co-targeted by mir <dig> in subgroup  <dig> - lignin deposition, mucilage production and stomatal aperture  <cit> , and the remaining two were ungrouped. twelve mir828-targeted mybs grouped into five subgroups, i.e. s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig> - anthocyanin biosynthesis and s <dig> - trichome initiation . the  <dig> mybs targeted by mir <dig> fell into  <dig> subgroups, which were shown to regulate diverse biological processes, including organ morphogenesis, lignification, anthocyanin biosynthesis and plant response to stresses in arabidopsis . therefore, mir <dig> could play a more fundamental and diverse role in peach, compared to mir <dig> or mir <dig>  interestingly, of the  <dig> mybs,  <dig> were related to phenylpropanoid metabolism, which is a key pathway associated with stone hardening and fruit color development, suggesting an important role of these mirnas in regulation of peach fruit development and ripening.

discussion
peach mirnas and their targets with diverse biological significance
in plants, mirnas are both highly conserved and rapidly evolving, and these features have been characterized in a variety of lineages  <cit> . while extensive research has been carried out on model plants, less is known about the characterization and functional analysis of mirnas from plant species with agricultural and horticultural significance such as peach and apple  <cit> . an earlier study reported computational and experimental identification of eight mirnas from seven conserved mirna families in peach  <cit> , not extensive compared to those identified in other plant species  <cit> . here we provided a comprehensive analysis of peach mirnas produced in different tissues and characterized their expression patterns by both srna-seq and rna blot analyses. most of the identified peach mirnas were found to be tissue-specific, as previously observed for other plant species  <cit> . many known mirnas targets, mostly transcription factors, control diverse physiological processes and genetic programs associated with leaf polarity, lateral root formation, flowering, metabolism and stress responses  <cit> . in this study, a majority of the targets for peach mirnas have counterparts previously identified in other species  <cit> . for example, two gene targets identified for mir <dig> in peach are homologus to those in arabidopsis encoding two auxin response factors  that act as repressors in auxin signaling, while a target for mir <dig> in peach is homologous to atarf <dig> which is an activator in the same pathway  <cit> . peach tasiarfs target genes that encode auxin signal repressors as their arabidopsis counterpart does. further, mir <dig> that targets tir1/afb <dig> auxin receptor  clade, another class of key players for auxin signaling  <cit>  was also found to target three taar homologs in peach. evidently, mirna- and tasiarf-mediated regulation of the auxin signaling pathway previously characterized in arabidopsis is also conserved in peach. however, some of the identified known mirnas were found to have additional or novel gene targets in peach . for example, mir <dig> that is known to target a conserved family of growth-regulating factor genes also targeted a rho guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor that is involved with phytochrome signaling. likewise, mir <dig>  besides targeting the conserved copper ion binding protein, could also target two genes encoding a selenium-binding protein and a d-type cyclin, which regulate plant defense and growth, respectively  <cit> . these results suggest that some known mirnas have either acquired new targets or expanded their regulatory functions in peach.

our work found  <dig> peach-specific mirnas, which were differentially regulated in various tissues and/or developmental stages  and targeted a variety of genes with a wide range of biological functions. for example, mirc6a/b targeted two genes encoding pentatricopeptide  repeat-containing proteins involved in rna editing, splicing and translation within mitochondria and chloroplasts  <cit> . mirc <dig> and mirc <dig> both targeted the same nbs-lrr disease resistance protein  <cit> . other peach-specific mirnas were found to target genes associated with transcription/translation initiation, protein kinases, and esterase/lipase/thioesterase family proteins. mirc <dig> was found to target a transcript encoding vip , a gene that modulates vernalization in arabidopsis <cit> . we identified targets for only  <dig> of the  <dig> peach-specific mirnas, which raises a question of whether these remaining mirnas are non-functional, or alternatively regulate gene expression by translational repression, not direct cleavage of target mrnas  <cit> . conceivably, further improvement of degradome analysis sensitivity and detailed examination of possible translational repression functions of these mirnas in peach or transgenic plants would provide information of whether or not these mirnas are functional in peach.

differential processing of mirna precursors in peach
in animals, many mirnas with distinct spatio-temporal expression patterns are modulated by transcriptional and/or post-transcription regulation  <cit> . in plants though, mirna transcripts are thought to be immediately processed into mature mirnas through the processing machinery  inside the nucleus, hence the transcript precursor processing is coupled with the transcription  <cit> . however, a recent study in maize showed that transcription was not closely associated with transcript precursor processing for two mirnas in specific tissues. the accumulation of abundant mir166a transcript precursors but not mature mir166a was detected in the tip of the maize shoot apical meristem  <cit> . transcript precursors were observed for mir <dig> by rt-pcr in the l <dig> but not the l <dig> layer of the shoot apical meristem while similar levels of mature mir <dig> was revealed in the same l <dig> and l <dig> layers by in situ hybridization  <cit> . these results suggest that both mir166a and mir <dig> precursors could be differentially processed in various cell types or tissues, although other possibilities, including mirna stability and mobility, could not be ruled out  <cit> . in this study, we detected differential accumulation of mature mirnas and their transcript precursors for nine peach mirnas . by comparing the mirna precursor processing efficiency among tissues for two chosen mirnas , we found that the processing efficiency of their transcript precursors varied in root, bark, leaf, flower, as well as during fruit development , demonstrating that differential processing modulates mirc <dig> and mirc <dig> expression. we also found that there was no correlation between mirna transcription and precursor processing activities thereby demonstrating the two processes can likely be uncoupled. our detection of these larger transcripts provided substantial evidence for differential processing, though still not conclusive, suggesting this might be part of the basis for the mirna expression in specific tissues or developmental stages in peach. similar observations were found during apple mirna identification indicating such a regulatory mechanism may be common in fruit crops.

although the mechanism underlying differential processing of mirna precursors in plants remains unknown, it has been characterized in animal cells where mirna biogenesis is initiated by processing the pri-mirna transcript into mirna precursors  by the microprocessor complex containing the dsrna-binding protein dgcr <dig> and the rnase iii enzyme drosha as well as multiple accessory proteins  <cit> . the processed pre-mirnas are exported to the cytoplasm and cleaved into mature 22-nt mirnas by dicer proteins. two groups of protein factors that utilize distinct strategies to modulate differential processing of mirna precursors have been identified and characterized. group one factors  interact with the microprocessor complex and accessory factors  to activate or repress the processing of pri-mirnas  <cit> . group two factors  recognize and bind to the terminal loop of specific mirna precursors to facilitate the processing or degradation of the bound mirna precursors in specific tissues or cell types  <cit> . conceivably, various factors expressed in specific tissues or developmental stages could directly or indirectly interact in the same manner to modulate the processing of specific mirna precursors in peach. our findings here implied a prevailing differential stabilization of mirna precursors, most likely to be dependent on the tissue-specific action of dcls, hyls, hens and other rna-binding proteins.

the conserved trans-acting sirna pathway in peach
to date, four tas gene families have been characterized in arabidopsis, of which the mir390-tas <dig> and mir828-tas <dig> pathways are conserved in plants  <cit> . here we identified both tas <dig> and tas <dig> peach orthologs, together with their corresponding trigger mirnas . we also found similar sirna biogenesis patterns in the cleaved tas <dig> and tas <dig> transcripts. the tasirna species are conserved as evidenced by the identification of homologous tasiarfs and tas4-sirna and their targets either confirmed by degradome analysis  and/or in silico prediction. together, these data indicate that both mir390-tas <dig> and mir828-tas <dig> biogenesis pathways and functions are at least partially conserved in peach. since auxin signaling and modulation is essential for diverse biological processes in peach, especially for fruit development and ripening  <cit> , mir390-tas <dig> biogenesis-derived tasiarfs in specific tissues could orchestrate auxin signaling that could be directly relevant to fruit growth and development. in arabidopsistas4-sirna has been shown to target genes  that positively regulate anthocyanin production  <cit> . the induction of atmyb <dig> along with anthocyanin accumulation activates mir <dig>  tas <dig> and tas4-sirna  <cit> . this feedback regulatory loop is proposed to maintain proper anthocyanin levels in plant tissues under nutrient stress condition  <cit> . this role of tas4-sirna could also be important in peach, where anthocyanin production is directly related to fruit color, which can be highly variable and is considered as an important fruit quality trait  <cit> . while direct gene targets for tas4-sirna have not been confirmed by the degradome analysis, in silico prediction showed that tas4-sirna can target at least two peach mybs highly homologous to atmyb <dig>  thus, mir <dig>  tas4tas4-sirna and the targeted mybs could form a similar feedback regulatory circle that control anthocyanin accumulation and possibly fruit coloration during peach fruit ripening, which is further supported by the observation of detectable mir <dig> expression in the mature but not the young fruit .

mirna-mediated myb regulatory networks in peach and their biological relevance
while mybs are known to be targeted by mirnas in other species  <cit> , the target number is limited  <cit> . in peach, at least  <dig> mybs can be potentially targeted by mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> . this expansion may have to do with the specialized developmental programs that potentially are regulated through specific mybs, including but not limited to the lignin synthesis and deposition that orchestrates the stone hardening process and the flavonoid synthesis that is important to fruit color, nutritive properties and disease resistance  <cit> . the lignin and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways are biochemically competitive, drawing from the same phenylpropanoid precursors. thus, they need to be tightly coordinated during peach fruit development to enable efficient phenylpropanoid metabolism in a tissue specific fashion  <cit> . while we were only able to detect mir <dig> expression during fruit development , we cannot rule out the potential roles of mir <dig> and mir <dig> since they could be highly cell- or tissue-, or stage-specific during fruit development, and their expression window period might be missed in this study. still, the potential regulatory roles of mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> in lignin, cell wall and flavonoid metabolism and synthesis pathways provides evidence for a significant role of srna in coordinating fruit development.

the finding that mir <dig> shares five myb targets with mir <dig> and two with mir <dig>  respectively, and three mir828-targeted mybs undergo sirna biogenesis supports the notion of the evolution of a mirna- and sirna-mediated silencing reinforcement regulatory mechanism in peach. the co-targeting of the same mybs by two mirnas is expected to strengthen their silencing function while mirna cleavage followed by sirna biogenesis reinforces the same silencing effect. although these are two unrelated biological events, they achieve the same goal, executing a strong responsive regulatory function; hence the mirna-mediated co-targeting could also enable the targeted mybs to be under refined spatio-temporal regulation. thus the observed distinct expression patterns of mir <dig> and mir <dig> among various tissues and fruit developmental stages would modulate the co-targeted myb expression in an exquisite spatio-temporal manner, to precisely regulate the co-ordination of lignification in stone and mesocarp- and ectocarp-specific fruit coloring during peach fruit development and ripening.

CONCLUSIONS
we characterized mirnas and their potential targets in peach to provide a comprehensive list of peach mirnas and reveal the potential scope of their regulatory functions. we show that peach has both conserved and species-specific mirnas with distinct expression patterns, and that these mirnas potentially target dozens of genes with a wide range of biological functions. quite a few of the peach-specific mirna precursors are subject to differential processing in various tissues and during fruit development, indicating possible mechanisms that define the extent of mirna accumulation in a spatio-temporal manner. further, both mir390-tas <dig> and mir828-tas <dig> sirna biogenesis pathways and their functions appear to be conserved in peach; mir <dig> cleavage is capable of activating sirna biogenesis in pptas <dig> and three myb protein-coding transcripts, indicating a silencing reinforcement in peach. in addition, we found that mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> collectively target  <dig> mybs,  <dig> of which are known to regulate phenylpropanoid metabolism, a key pathway involved in stone hardening and fruit color development. in summary, we extensively characterize the unique expression pattern and processing regulation of peach mirnas, and demonstrate the presence of a complex mirna regulatory network capable of targeting a wide variety of biological functions in peach. our results provide new and valuable information for deciphering the intricate roles of peach mirnas and tasirnas in gene regulation, which will be useful for the further investigation of mirna and tasirna functions in other crop species.
