BACKGROUND
brucellae are gram-negative, facultative, intracellular bacteria that can infect many species of animals and man. six species were initially recognized within the genus brucella: b. abortus, b. melitensis, b. suis, b. ovis, b. canis, and b. neotomae  <cit> . this classification is mainly based on differences in pathogenicity, host preference, and phenotypic characteristics. four additional species have been included in the genus brucella since  <dig>  these comprise the species b. ceti and b. pinnipedialis isolated from marine mammals, with cetaceans  and pinnipeds  as preferred host respectively  <cit> . b. microti described in  <dig> was first isolated from the common vole and then from the red fox, and from soil  <cit> . the latest described species is b. inopinata, isolated from an infected human breast implant, and currently the most divergent brucella species at the phenotypic and molecular level  <cit> . the animal or environmental reservoir of b. inopinata is not known. new brucella species will likely be described in the future such as for isolates from baboons  <cit> , from wild rodents in australia  <cit>  and for strain bo <dig> isolated from a patient with chronic destructive pneumonia  <cit> . strain bo <dig> and strains from wild australian rodents have been proposed as a novel lineage of the b. inopinata species  <cit> .

molecular and phenotypic typing of marine mammal brucella strains led to their classification into two species, b. ceti and b. pinnipedialis, according to their preferred host, cetaceans and pinnipeds respectively  <cit> . however, several subgroups were identified within each species by molecular typing methods such as multilocus sequence analysis , multilocus vntr  analysis , or omp2a and omp2b porin genes  <cit> . among them one subgroup within b. ceti, exclusively composed of strains isolated from various dolphin species, was proposed to constitute a separate species with the name b. delphini  <cit> . the isolates from cetaceans from the pacific may also constitute a separate species  <cit> . three human cases with naturally acquired infection by brucella strains presumably from marine origin were reported, one case of spinal osteomyelitis from a patient in new zealand  <cit>  and two neurobrucellosis cases from peruvian patients  <cit> . interestingly, these human isolates exhibited the same genotype as strains from cetaceans from the pacific  <cit> .

among their distinctive characteristics at the molecular and genomic level, marine mammal brucella strains were shown to carry in their genomes a higher number of the insertion sequence element is <dig>   <cit>  than terrestrial mammal brucella species and biovars with the exception of b. ovis  <cit> . consequently, infrequent restriction site-pcr  methods and more recently ligation-mediated pcr  were applied, taking into account this higher number of is <dig> elements, to study the genomic diversity of marine mammal strains  <cit> . these studies confirmed the classification into two marine mammal brucella species, each divided in subgroups. in addition, six specific is711-containing dna fragments were detected allowing the molecular identification of b. ceti and its subgroup composed exclusively of dolphin isolates  <cit> . besides these specific is711-containing fragments another dna fragment was detected that was exclusively found in b. pinnipedialis strains, with the exception of hooded seal isolates, consisting of a putative genomic island  <cit> . the size of this island was estimated at  <dig> kbp according to the physical maps made from the genomes of marine mammal strains by macrorestriction analyses  <cit> .

the taxonomy of brucella is still controversial, with an ongoing debate on whether they should be considered as distinct species or distinct strains of b. melitensis, considering the close proximity of their genomes  <cit> . we determined and analyzed the complete genome of b. pinnipedialis b2/ <dig> to bring new insights into the origin of brucella isolated from marine mammals as well as their time of divergence from brucella isolated from terrestrial animals.

RESULTS
the genome sequence of b. pinnipedialis b2/ <dig> was determined  by shotgun sequencing with the gs-flx technology and the remaining gaps filled using the standard sanger technology. like that of other brucella strains, the genome is composed of two circular chromosomes, of  <dig> , <dig> bp  and  <dig> , <dig> bp in lengths, respectively. bioinformatic annotation predicted the presence of  <dig>  protein coding genes,  <dig> trnas and  <dig> ribosomal rnas. the comparison with the known genomes of other brucella species revealed the presence of  <dig> pseudogenes. the 23s rdna sequence of b. pinnipedialis b2/ <dig> was found similar to that of other brucella species, in contrast with the anomalous and unexpected 23s ribosomal rna sequence previously described for b. microti  <cit> .

genome structure and whole gene set phylogeny
the phylogenetic placement of b. pinnipedialis b2/ <dig> was assessed with the help of a whole gene tree including all orthologous genes from brucella strains available in the complete genome division of genbank, completed by sequence data from selected brucella strains of particular phylogenetic relevance, either deposited in the whole genome shotgun  division of genbank, or available from other sources . this includes sequences from b. neotomae,  <dig> sequences from marine mammal brucella strains, brucella sp. b <dig>  b. inopinata bo <dig>  brucella sp. 83/ <dig> or brucella sp. nf <dig>  the resulting tree  readily shows that the brucella species with the highest sequence similarity with b. pinnipedialis b2/ <dig> and whose complete genome is available is b. microti ccm  <dig>  this is a consequence of the relatively slow evolution rate of those two species rather than reflecting a particular phylogenetic affinity the central position occupied by b. microti, just at the root of host-associated brucella species, is also confirmed. this tree distinguishes five major groups, the b. suis strains , the different b. melitensis and b. abortus strains, also well separated from each other , another group with b. ovis and brucella sp. nvsl 07- <dig> , and marine mammal brucella strains . b. neotomae remains isolated in this tree and constitutes the fifth group. however, the resolution of this tree is insufficient to infer the relative order of divergence of those different groups. moreover, while bootstrap values in this tree are in general very strong , the branching ) proposed in the maximum likelihood tree is generally not supported, with a bootstrap value of 12%, prompting for a finer analysis of the events shaping the brucella evolutionary tree.

the genome sequences of b. microti ccm  <dig> and b. pinnipedialis b2/ <dig> were found to be remarkably conserved even at the nucleotide level, allowing to generate a complete alignment of the chromosomes of the two species from which a list of all indels   was easily obtained. in spite of the overall similarity of these two genomes, this alignment revealed major changes in genome structure, as large segments unshared between the two species. the alignment from the largest chromosome exhibited  <dig> gapped positions with the largest insert in b. microti being  <dig>  bp long, and the largest in b. pinnipedialis being  <dig>  bp long. the alignment from the small chromosome exhibits  <dig> gapped positions, the largest insert being  <dig>  bp long in b. microti and  <dig>  bp long in b. pinnipedialis. the total number of indels  found in comparing these two species is thus smaller than the  <dig> indels found in comparing b. microti ccm  <dig> and b. suis  <dig>  <cit> . the complete alignment contains a total of  <dig> , <dig> aligned positions , with  <dig> % of nucleotide changes in aligned regions . this fraction of nucleotide substitution is also smaller than what was observed between b. microti ccm  <dig> and b. suis  <dig>  where a  <dig> % divergence was reported  <cit> .

detailed analysis of the largest unshared sequence regions and the branching order of host associated brucella species
the evolutionary history of the largest segments unshared between b. microti ccm  <dig> and b. pinnipedialis b2/ <dig> was analyzed by examining the structure of the orthologous loci in the other brucella species for which sequence data was available . on the large chromosome, the  <dig> largest indels are  <dig> kbp, and  <dig>  kbp in length. on the small chromosome, the largest indels are  <dig> kbp,  <dig> kpb,  <dig> kbp and  <dig>  kbp in length. all other indels are at most the size of an is <dig> insertion sequence . the presence/absence of the above genomic inserts was assessed in other brucella strains . for each segment, we recorded the number of nucleotides with homologues in the other brucella genomes . the presence/absence of those segments is reported at the leaves of the tree  as filled squares. the evolutionary history of those unshared genome segments, treated as discrete characters, was reconstructed by parsimony analysis using the mesquite software , and represented as a cladogram in additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig>  the proposed evolutionary scenario corresponding to those unshared segments is discussed below, the largest ones first.

the locus of bmi_ii545- <dig> in b. microti ccm  <dig> is occupied in the b. pinnipedialis b2/ <dig> small chromosome by a  <dig>  bp insert  which is present in a number of brucella strains from marine mammals and partially in b. ovis atcc  <dig>  the gene arrangements of this genomic region in b. pinnipedialis, b. microti and b. ovis are depicted in figure  <dig>  this region is flanked on both sides by an is <dig> element , at a location where a sole copy of the is <dig> element is found in b. microti ccm  <dig> , as in all brucella strains lacking this insert. this region is partially found in b. ovis atcc  <dig>  except in the interval between bpi_ii <dig> and bpi_ii <dig> deleted from b. ovis. the deletion in b. ovis atcc  <dig> occurred inside the gene bov_a <dig>  whose  <dig> first amino acids are similar to bpi_ii <dig> and whose last  <dig> amino acids are similar to bpi_ii <dig>  this interval exhibits a few protein coding genes or their remnants, with similarities mainly found in distant alphaproteobacteria i.e. excluding brucella and ochrobactrum. in particular, two pseudogenes, bpi_ii <dig> and bpi_ii <dig>  separated by one is <dig> element, appear to be the remnants of two consecutive paracoccus denitrificans genes coding for 5-oxoprolinase  and are preceded by an arac-family transcriptional regulator  with similarity into the same organism . the same three genes are also found grouped together but in different orders in the genomes of several betaproteobacteria e.g bordetella avium  or verminephrobacter eiseniae . two consecutive genes, etfa  and etfb  are also present on the large chromosome with 100% nucleotide identity. we also observed  <dig> components of a spermidine/putrescine abc-transporter  found colinearly in the genomes of e.g. roseobacter denitrificans  or silicibacter pomeroyi . we found similarities to two consecutive genes of parvibaculum lavamentivorans , similarities to plav_ <dig> being noticed on both sides of the bpi_ii574- <dig> isbm <dig> transposase gene. other genes like the aldehyde dehydrogenase bpi_ii <dig> have best matches in brucella and ochrobactrum, but with 73% similarity only at the amino acid level. several transposase genes are also present. this large  <dig> kbp fragment probably found its origin in the common ancestor of the marine mammal brucella species and b. ovis, as attested by its partial presence in b. ovis. the structure of this segment suggests a grouping of b. ovis with marine mammal brucella sp. . it may have been lost thereafter several times, in brucella sp. strain nvsl 07- <dig> isolated from a baboon and along the b. ceti and b. pinnipedialis lineages, putatively by recombination of the two is <dig> copies.

a  <dig>  bp fragment on the large chromosome  is not found in b. microti ccm  <dig>  this fragment is present in all b. melitensis and b. abortus strains and in b. neotomae, but its occurrence is quite variable among b. ceti and b. pinnipedialis strains and even among b. suis strains, where it is observed in the earliest diverging b. suis  <dig> and b. suis atcc  <dig>  but absent otherwise. this fragment starts with a phage integrase gene  and ends with a trna  which was the likely insertion site. an is <dig> element is inserted within a gene  that remained intact in b. melitensis  <dig> m  and b. ovis atcc  <dig> . this fragment encodes a flagellar protein flgj . the other putative genes in this region have no convincing similarities to annotated proteins. this  <dig> kbp fragment  probably entered the brucella genomes after b. microti divergence, and disappeared separately on several branches. it confirms the grouping of b. ceti cudo, b. ceti b1/ <dig>  b. ceti m490/95/ <dig> and brucella sp. f5/ <dig>  its presence in the genome of b. neotomae 5k <dig> and absence in b. suis strains except for b. suis atcc  <dig> and b. suis  <dig> suggest its insertion prior to the divergence of the b. suis and b. neotomae lineage, and a subsequent loss in the b. suis lineage.

a  <dig>  bp region on the small chromosome  is absent from the b. pinnipedialis b2/ <dig> genome . this region is present in b. microti, b. suis, b. canis, b. ceti, brucella sp. f5/ <dig>  b. neotomae and absent in b. abortus, b. melitensis, b. ovis and b. pinnipedialis. additionally, a partial match was found in the genome of brucella sp. b <dig>  in this region, the presence of genes encoding trai-j proteins involved in bacterial conjugation can be noted. like the above  <dig> kbp fragment, this  <dig> kbp fragment  supports a divergence of the b. melitensis/b. abortus clade prior to the separation of b. ovis, brucella sp. strain nvsl 07- <dig> and marine mammal brucella strains. it might have appeared before b. microti divergence, and disappeared several times, in particular from the branch leading to the b. abortus/b. melitensis clade and from the branch leading to the b. pinnipedialis clade.

the  <dig> kbp region on the small chromosome is a phage related region discussed in  <cit>  and unique to b. microti . it will not be discussed further .

still on the small chromosome, a  <dig>  bp region  encodes genes bmi_ii1086- <dig>  this fragment  appeared before b. microti divergence, and is absent from the branch leading to b. ovis and brucella sp. strain nvsl 07- <dig>  but also from the branch leading to b. pinnipedialis m292/94/ <dig> and b. pinnipedialis b2/ <dig>  separating those two species from b. pinnipedialis m163/99/ <dig>  closer examination reveals that this  <dig>  kbp fragment is absent in b. ovis because it belongs to a much larger  <dig>  kbp region deleted from b. ovis  <cit>  and also partially deleted from brucella sp. nvsl 07- <dig>  where an approximately  <dig> kbp long region is missing . this finding supports both grouping of the b. pinnipedialis m292/94/ <dig> and b2/ <dig> strains, and that of b. ovis with brucella sp. strain nvsl 07- <dig> 

between bmi_i <dig> and bmi_i <dig>  there is a  <dig>  bp region deleted from the b. pinnipedialis b2/ <dig> large chromosome  but also from b. ovis atcc  <dig>  brucella sp. nvsl 07- <dig> and all b. melitensis and b. abortus strains. interestingly, this deletion occurred inside a gene , thus showing that it is a deletion and not an acquisition event. this region  is particularly informative because it clearly separates brucella strains into two groups. this fragment was present in ancestral brucella, and then lost after the divergence of the b. suis clade, of b. neotomae, of b. microti and prior to the divergence of b. abortus and b. melitensis, b. ovis and brucella sp. strain nvsl 07- <dig>  and finally marine mammal brucella species. an interesting exception is found in b. abortus b <dig>  where this abc transporter gene is intact. this feature clearly suggests a divergence of the b. suis and b. neotomae group before that of the other host-associated brucella.

is <dig> insertion sequences
is <dig> insertion sequences  <cit>  account for a large number of gaps within the complete genome alignment of b. pinnipedialis b2/ <dig> and b. microti ccm  <dig>  in total,  <dig> is <dig> elements were identified on the large chromosome and  <dig> on the small chromosome of b. pinnipedialis. we looked for the occurrence of those insertion sequences in the available complete genomes of brucella  and reported their position in figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  although it is difficult to analyze transposable repetitive elements in unfinished genomes   <cit> , we included two other partial genomes in our analysis, but where an abundant number of is <dig> elements were observed, b. ceti cudo and brucella sp. strain nvsl 07- <dig> 

difference in gene content
comparing orthologous loci , we found that the number of pseudogenes in the genome of b. pinnipedialis b2/ <dig> was larger than that in the genome of b. microti ccm  <dig> . this was also noticed when comparing b. microti ccm  <dig> and b. suis  <dig>  and was attributed to a slower evolution rate in b. microti. the genes that are potentially different in both species are reported in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig> 

among the genes altered in b. pinnipedialis b2/ <dig>  many are components of abc transporters. those genes are highlighted in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  we found  <dig> genes related to abc transporters that are impaired, on a total of  <dig> impaired genes. in the b. pinnipedialis genome we identified approximately  <dig> abc transporter-related intact genes on a total of  <dig>  protein coding genes. this output is highly improbable  and strongly suggest that abc transporters were specifically degraded in b. pinnipedialis and more generally in host-associated brucella species. beside abc type transport systems, many other genes involved in transport are found impaired in b. pinnipedialis b2/94: a cora family transporter bpi_i <dig> , an emrb/qaca family drug resistance transporter bpi_i <dig> , the dipeptide transport system permease protein dppc , an outer membrane autotransporter bpi_i <dig> , a glucose/galactose transporter bpi_ii <dig> , a cadmiun-translocating p-type atpase bpi_ii <dig> , and finally a putative transport protein bpi_ii <dig> .

one of those abc transporter genes, bpi_i <dig>  exhibits an interesting feature. a frameshift difference between the b. pinnipedialis b2/ <dig> and b. microti ccm  <dig> sequences merges the membrane and atp-binding components  of a thiamin abc transporter into a single reading frame. a blast  search of the bpi_i <dig> gene sequence against the nucleotide sequences of the other brucella strains shows that this gene fusion occurred in all marine mammal strains studied, except for b. ceti m13/05/ <dig> and m644/ <dig> which represent the distinct dolphin subgroup of strains within b. ceti mentioned above.

CONCLUSIONS
time of appearance of marine mammal brucella species
it has been suggested  <cit>  that the divergence of species in the genus brucella could have been concomitant with the divergence of their mammalian hosts,  <dig> millions years  ago. however this is inconsistent with the fact that the hosts of b. ceti and b. pinnipedialis did not diverge at the same time. the ancestors of pinnipeds where carnivores and higdon et al.  <cit>  used molecular data to estimate the split between ursids and pinnipeds to  <dig>  ±  <dig>   my, and fossil records report early pinnipeds  <dig> my ago  <cit> . cetaceans went back to the sea much earlier, the oldest known cetaceans date back to the eocene,  <dig> my ago  <cit> . if we consider divergence in the 16s rrna gene sequence, and referring to b. microti which has a central position, b. pinnipedialis, b. melitensis, b. abortus, b. suis  differences, c- > t at position  <dig> and g- > t at position 1468), b. ovis, b. canis have all identical sequences, and b. neotomae has  <dig> bp difference . using the estimate of 1-2% of change in 16s rrna sequence per  <dig> my,  <dig> bp difference  corresponds to  <dig> % change, and a divergence time of  <dig> - <dig>  my. this time estimate is probably a crude overestimation and recent work  <cit> , using single nucleotide polymorphisms from  <dig> genomes, showed that most brucella species probably diverged  <dig>  to  <dig>  years ago. this analysis reveals that the divergence time of brucella sp. found today in marine mammals is totally incompatible with the divergence time of their hosts. a fortuitous contamination of cetaceans and pinnipeds, probably via the food chain, may explain better this transmission of brucella to the marine mammals. this also opens the remote possibility of marine brucella infecting terrestrial mammals.

on the order of appearance of host-associated brucella species
the analysis of distinctive genomic regions between b. microti ccm  <dig> and b. pinnipedialis b2/ <dig> as well as the study of additional markers reveal the order of appearance of the different brucella species. it is clearly apparent that most of the events following the divergence of b. microti from the classical brucella species occurred in a very small amount of time, as if something caused a sudden radiation in this lineage and a subsequent adaptation of the organisms to their hosts. here we summarize some of the major evolutionary events that highlight the evolutionary history of the genus brucella.

following the divergence of b. microti, the next evolutionary event that we can trace is the  <dig>  kbp fragment clear disappearance, which tells us that the two next brucella groups to diverge were b. suis and b. neotomae. we did not find any good marker in favor of a prior divergence of one versus the other.

marine mammal brucella species as well as b. ovis and brucella sp. nvsl 07- <dig> share the presence of a high number of is <dig> elements, and it has been demonstrated that is <dig> transposition is still an active process in b. ovis and b. pinnipedialis  <cit> . those insertion elements are much less numerous in b. melitensis and b. abortus strains and we thus assume that is <dig> transposition events occurred quite abundantly after the divergence of b. melitensis/b. abortus. in this group, b. abortus strains share a unique feature which is a genomic  <dig> kbp inversion in the small chromosome, as clearly depicted on figure  <dig> of reference  <cit> .

the whole gene tree, where b. ovis and brucella sp. nvsl 07- <dig> cluster together, the  <dig> is <dig> elements positions that they have in common and not shared with b. pinnipedialis b2/ <dig> as well as the large deletion that those two species share, in the region surrounding the  <dig>  kbp deletion in b. pinnipedialis, all those facts support the grouping of b. ovis with brucella sp. nvsl 07- <dig>  the grouping of marine mammal brucella strains that we observe in the tree with early divergence of b. ceti m13/05/ <dig> and m644/ <dig> is also reflected by the gene fusion event mentioned earlier. grouping of b. pinnipedialis m292/ <dig> and b2/ <dig> is supported by the loss of the  <dig> kbp fragment in these two strains.

the explosive radiation in the genus brucella
there is a clear transition in the genus brucella evolutionary tree. the first brucella discovered were the host-associated brucella species, but more recently, b. microti was isolated as the first representative of a fast growing list of free-living brucella. this biochemically highly active bacteria was found to share more phenotypic traits with ochrobactrum than with the host-associated brucella species  <cit> . we proposed earlier  <cit>  that the transition between a free-living and an host-associated life style could have resulted from the modification in the 23s ribosomal rna gene sequence with putative effects on the growth rate of the bacteria. a slow growth rate has often been advocated for intra-cellular bacteria, as their survival is often dependent on the survival of their hosts  <cit> . brucella with this change in 23s structure and its impact on growth rate became suddenly more adapted to an host-associated life style than to a free-living style, and progressively adapted to distinct sets of hosts, giving rise to the main lineages of host-associated brucella species that are encountered today.
