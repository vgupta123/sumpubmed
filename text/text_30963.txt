BACKGROUND
the structure hierarchy of proteins is defined in terms of four levels: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary. the term quaternary structure was first introduced by bernal in  <dig>  <cit> . it refers to the non-covalent interactions of protein subunits to form oligomers and the spatial arrangement of the subunits.

oligomeric proteins are very common in nature. they can be divided further into two classes: homo-oligomers and hetero-oligomers; the former are composed of identical subunits while the latter are composed of non-identical subunits. for example, the potassium channel is formed by a homo-tetramer  <cit>  , and the gamma-aminobytyric acid type a  receptor is formed by a hetero-pentamer  <cit> . the subunit construction of proteins provides the structural basis for their activities and functions in various biological processes, which include metabolism, signal transduction and chromosome replication  <cit> . from an evolutional point of view, the oligomeric proteins have more advantages than the monomers  <cit> . it is easier for multi-subunit proteins to repair their defects by simply replacing the flawed subunit  <cit> . moreover, in a number of biological processes, the quaternary structure of proteins is indispensable for their function  <cit> . thus, the study of the quaternary structure is an interesting field in bioinformatics.

it is generally accepted that the amino acid sequence of most proteins contains all the information needed to fold the protein into its correct three-dimensional structure  <cit> . the quaternary structure of proteins, which is the association of tertiary structure subunits, depends on the existence of complementary "patches" on their surfaces  <cit> . therefore, the patches that are buried in the interfaces formed by the subunits play a vital role in both tertiary and quaternary structures. this suggests the possibility to predict the quaternary structure from primary sequences  <cit> .

the actual quaternary structure features of proteins must be determined by experiments, which are slow and expensive. however, computational methods like machine learning, can extract some valuable information such as the number of subunits from protein amino acid sequences. they may play a role in the study of this issue, when the genome-sequencing project produces such large amounts of sequence information. some efforts have been made in developing computational tools to predict protein quaternary structure from its sequence. among them, the methods employed were the decision-tree method with the feature extraction function   <cit>  , the support vector machine  and the covariant discriminant algorithm with two protein sequence descriptors  <cit>  , the pseudo amino acid composition method  <cit>  , and the function of degree of disagreement  method  <cit> .

in this paper, the functional domain composition of proteins was initially adopted to investigate the problem. in some previous work, the functional domain information has been used to predict protein-protein interaction  <cit>  , protein structure  <cit>  and protein function  <cit>  etc. the promising results have indicated that the domain composition of a protein is closely linked with its function and interactions with other proteins. the quaternary structure is closely related to the interactions between the subunits of an oligomer; thus, it's closely related to the functional domains of a protein. consequently, we chose the functional domain composition as the feature to represent a protein. the present study is limited to homo-oligomers. the jackknife cross-validation test was performed on the protein dataset in which the sequence identity was less than 25%. the overall success rate is  <dig> %. in the same dataset, the amino acid composition method and blast  <cit>  achieved the accuracy of  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively. the results demonstrate that the functional domain composition approach is a promising high-throughput method in dealing with this complicated problem in bioinformatics.

RESULTS
the computations were carried out on a dell optiplex gx <dig> computer with an intel pentium <dig>  <dig>  ghz cpu. it is well known that in statistical prediction, the single independent dataset test, the self-consistency test, and the jackknife test are the three methods often used in algorithm assessment. among them, the jackknife test is considered the most objective and rigorous way to do cross-validation  <cit> . the success prediction rate in practical application should be measured by the result of the jackknife test, rather than the sub-sampling test or the limited independent dataset test  <cit> . therefore, in this work, the results acquired from the jackknife test were considered to be the success rates of the functional domain composition approach proposed here.

in addition to the jackknife test performed on the training dataset, we predicted all the  <dig> proteins in the independent dataset with nna as well. each protein in the independent dataset was assigned into the structural category to which its nearest neighbor protein in the non-redundant training dataset belongs. as shown in table  <dig>   <dig> proteins were correctly classified and the overall accuracy is  <dig> %.

furthermore, we also tried to compare the results with previous studies. garian employed the decision tree and binning function to build models for classifying homo-dimers from other homo-oligomers, and obtained an accuracy of  <dig> %  <cit> . zhang et al. used the same dataset to classify homo-dimers by the svms and the covariant discriminant algorithms. they obtained overall accuracies ranging from  <dig> % to  <dig> % by the svms and from  <dig> % to  <dig> % by the covariant discriminant algorithms  <cit> . through a tentative comparison in the category of homo-dimers, the results show that we achieved similar or better levels of prediction in terms of accuracy.

CONCLUSIONS
the functional domain composition method is an effective method that has been widely used in protein function prediction  <cit> . in this paper, it illustrates its power in the multi-class prediction of the protein quaternary structure. if we suppose that the protein samples were distributed according to the sizes of categories  <cit>  , then the rate of correct prediction by the measured random assignment would be  <dig> +  <dig> +  <dig> +  <dig> +  <dig> +  <dig> + 2â‰ˆ  <dig> %. evidently, the rates of correct prediction acquired by the functional domain composition approach are much higher than the random assignment, which suggests that the quaternary structure of an oligomeric protein can be inferred from its sequence and the function domain composition is a potent feature for quaternary structure prediction. presently, the quaternary classifier constructed in this paper is limited to homo-oligomers. with the accumulation of experimental data, the future work of quaternary structure prediction will take place in the area of investigating classifiers for hetero-oligomers.
