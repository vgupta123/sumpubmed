BACKGROUND
alternative splicing is an important and widespread mechanism that is used by higher organisms to express molecularly distinct mrnas in response to developmental and cellular contexts  <cit> . mutually exclusive splicing, in which only one exon is chosen out of a cluster of alternative exons arranged in a tandem array, is a very frequent alternative splicing event on a genome-wide level  <cit> . several mechanisms have been proposed that explain why only one of the two or more variants is included in the mature mrna  <cit> . mostly, metazoa contain mutually exclusive exons only in pairs. extreme cases for mutually exclusive splicing are the insects dscam genes that have arrays of up to  <dig> variants as observed in the drosophila dscam gene  <cit> . a less dramatic example is the mutually exclusive spliced drosophila muscle myosin heavy chain gene that can potentially produce  <dig> different mrnas  <cit> .

myosins comprise a large superfamily of actin-based motors that fulfill a variety of cellular functions from cell division, cellular locomotion, and vesicle transport to muscle contraction  <cit> .  <dig> classes of myosins have been identified to date with each class being responsible for a different function  <cit> . the first myosin was identified in skeletal muscle tissue over hundred years ago  and, since different myosins turned up, it has been referred to as conventional myosin or class-ii myosin. class-ii myosins comprise the largest and most extensively studied class not only because the muscle myosin genes and muscles have been in the focus of biophysical and biochemical studies for decades and because the metazoan species are the most studied organisms but also because this class contains the most isoforms per organism  <cit> .

drosophila melanogaster contains two class-ii myosin genes, one encoding the muscle isoforms  and one the nonmuscle isoform   <cit> . the mhc gene produces all different muscle myosins as a result of alternative rna splicing  <cit> . this is in contrast to the organisms of most other taxa of the metazoa lineage, that have a family of muscle myosin heavy chain genes with each gene coding for a protein specialized for a functional niche. for example, the nematode caenorhabditis elegans expresses six muscle myosins  <cit> , while the ascidian ciona intestinalis genome contains five muscle myosin heavy chain genes  <cit>  and vertebrate genomes encode up to  <dig> muscle myosin heavy chain isoforms  <cit> .

the drosophila mhc gene consists of  <dig> exons including five clusters of alternatively spliced exons and one differentially included penultimate exon. thus,  <dig> combinations of alternative exons are possible. the four clusters of alternative exons in the motor domain part of the gene code for  <dig> different variations of the motor domain. in contrast to the muscle myosins of the other metazoa species, changes modulating myosin function are thus limited to four regions in the head domain. these discrete regions of sequence variation have been shown to produce physiological differences among the various muscle types  <cit> . although many variations are possible and all alternative exons get expressed at some point in drosophila's life, only a limited number of combinations seem to be employed. for example, during drosophila embryogenesis only seven mhc transcripts have been found to be expressed  <cit> .

the genome of drosophila melanogaster was the third eukaryotic genome to be completely sequenced  <cit> . since then, the number of sequenced organisms has increased rapidly. of the phylum arthropoda, the genomes of the mosquitos anopheles gambiae  <cit>  and aedes aegypti  <cit>  and the silkworm bombyx mori  <cit>  have been published, and  <dig> further insect genomes have been finished of which eleven belong to the drosophila species group  <cit> .

originally, pseudogenes have been defined as dna sequences that are derived from functional genes, but acquired such degenerative features as premature stop codons and frameshift mutations, which make them unable to produce functional proteins  <cit> . non-processed pseudogenes are thought to result from tandem duplications of genes with subsequent accumulation of disabling mutations. processed pseudogenes lack introns and their original upstream gene regulatory resions and presumably arise by retrotransposition of a mature messenger rna . while non-processed pseudogenes are commonly found near the functional original gene, processed pseudogenes are randomly inserted into the genome. also, partially processed pseudogenes have been reported that sometimes contain the complete coding region  <cit> . recent studies have shown, that pseudogenes are not just "junk" dna but often exhibit functional roles .

here, we report the comparative genomic analysis of the muscle myosin heavy chain genes of all arthropod species that have completely been sequenced so far. on this basis we propose that the splicing process operates sequentially on the transcript involving the splicing of all unwanted alternative versions of an exon while retaining intronic sequence around the remaining variant.

RESULTS
identification and annotation of the muscle myosin heavy chains
the arthropod muscle myosin heavy chain genes were identified by tblastn searches against the corresponding genome data of the different species using the drosophila melanogaster protein as query . the species analysed were the mosquitos aedes aegypti, culex pipiens quinquefasciatus and anopheles gambiae, the silkworm bombyx mori, the honeybee apis mellifera, the jewel wasp nasonia vitripennis, the waterflea daphnia pulex, the rust-red flour beetle tribolium castaneum, the body louse pediculus humanus corporis, and thirteen drosophila species . according to the general nomenclature for myosin sequences  <cit>  the alternatively spliced muscle myosin heavy chain genes are named mhc <dig>  and the non-muscle myosin heavy chain genes are denoted mhc <dig>  the sequences were assigned by manual inspection of the genomic dna sequences. exons have been confirmed by the identification of flanking consensus intron-exon splice junction donor and acceptor sequences   <cit> . because of the five to nine clusters of mutually exclusive exons and the included or excluded penultimate exon, automatic identification of all exons failed. the genomic sequences of apis mellifera and bombyx mori contain several gaps that at least in one case must have contained missing exons. the expression of the myosin genes including the transcription of some of the mutually exclusive exons has been confirmed by analysis of corresponding est data.

the untranslated first exons of the genes have been assigned by analysing est data, if possible. because untranslated 5' exons were found for all those species for which est data covering the amino-termini of the genes is available, it is expected that the other arthropod myosin genes also contain untranslated first exons. accordingly, the unambiguously identified exons have been numbered starting with exon two. duplicated exons were named in alphabetical order according to the direction of transcription, the exception being the alternatively spliced exon  <dig> of the drosophila mhc <dig> of which the first of the mutually exclusive exons was named 11e for historical reasons  <cit> . the differentially included penultimate exons of the drosophila species have been predicted based on their similarity at the dna level. although this exon mainly consists of untranslated bases and its identity between the drosophila species is almost as low as that found in intron regions, the exon borders are conserved enough to be recognised. the carboxy-terminal exons of the other arthropod mhc <dig> genes have been confirmed by analysing est data, if possible. for ticmhc <dig> and dapmhc <dig> only one carboxy-terminal exon could be confirmed by est data. however, given the exon conservation between all arthropod mhc <dig> genes it is expected that both genes contain another carboxy-terminal exon. for nasonia, est data is not available. the carboxy-terminal exon of the navmhc <dig> gene was identified based on its homology to the other mhc <dig> exons. an exon corresponding to the penultimate exon of the other genes could not be identified.

the drosophila sp. mhc <dig> genes, the aeamhc <dig> and the cpqmhc <dig> gene contain consensus polyadenylation signals aataaa, while the mhc <dig> genes of ang, am, dap, nav, pdc, and tic contain polyadenylation signals of type aaaaaa. for the dmmhc <dig> gene it has been shown that the use of either polyadenylation site is not regulated  <cit>  and the same might be true for the two or multiple polyadenylation sites of the other arthropod genes.

identification of further muscle myosin heavy chain genes in aedes aegypti and culex pipiens quinquefasciatus
surprisingly, a second muscle myosin heavy chain gene has been identified in aedes aegypti  and named mhc <dig>  the mhc <dig> gene contains the same exon organisation as mhc <dig> except that it does not have any cluster of alternatively spliced exons and misses the two carboxy-terminal exons . many est clones provide supporting evidence for the deduced carboxy-terminus, the amino-terminal untranslated exon <dig>  and other parts of the gene. the exons related to the alternatively spliced exons of mhc <dig> are either identical  or very similar to one of the mhc <dig> exons. the protein sequence of mhc <dig> has an overall sequence identity of  <dig> % to mhc <dig>  besides the different carboxy-termini, the largest differences are in loop- <dig>  which is three residues shorter in mhc <dig>  and in loop- <dig>  which has only six instead of ten glycines and might therefore be structurally more restricted. the culex pipiens quinquefasciatus genome encodes another two muscle myosin heavy chain genes that are very similar to each other and have been named mhc <dig> and mhc <dig> . both have the same exon organisation as the cpqmhc <dig> gene except that they do not have any cluster of alternatively spliced exons and miss the two carboxy-terminal exons. another difference is that alternative exons  <dig> are fused to the following constitutive exons in the mhc <dig> and mhc <dig> genes. the protein sequence identity between cpqmhc <dig> and cpqmhc <dig> is  <dig> %, the identity to cpqmhc <dig> is  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. surprisingly, aeamhc <dig>  cpqmhc <dig> and cpqmhc <dig> retained identical variants of the alternatively spliced exons of the corresponding mhc <dig> genes.

the bmmhc <dig>  ticmhc <dig>  pdcmhc <dig> and dapmhc <dig> genes contain further clusters of alternatively spliced exons
the analysis of the bmmhc <dig>  ticmhc <dig>  pdcmhc <dig>  and dapmhc <dig> genes revealed further clusters of alternatively spliced exons compared to the dmmhc <dig> gene. all further sets of alternative exons encode for sequence that is part of the motor domain. the additional alternative exon of bm, pdc and tic is conserved between these three organisms, and is also encoded within the dap mhc <dig> gene. it is located between the alternatively spliced exons  <dig> and  <dig> , alternative exon  <dig> and constitutive exon  <dig> , and alternative exons  <dig> and  <dig> , respectively, and separated from the neighbouring alternatively spliced exons by constitutively expressed exons . in contrast to the other alternatively spliced exons, these alternatively spliced exons are different in length and amino acid conservation . the first part of the exon encodes part of loop- <dig> , that is a very flexible loop involved in actin-binding. in the arthropod genes it mainly consists of glycines, arginines, and lysines. thus, the alternatively spliced exons of bm, tic, pdc, and dap encode different numbers and compositions of these residues. the second part of the alternatively spliced exon is part of the following alpha-helix and hence completely conserved in length and strongly conserved in composition. in addition to this cluster of alternatively spliced exons, the dapmhc <dig> gene contains three further sets of alternatively spliced exons extending its number of clusters of alternatively spliced exons to nine . alternative exon  <dig> encodes an alternative p-loop to loop- <dig> sequence, alternative exon  <dig> directly follows the alternative exon encoding a structural part near the atp-binding site, and alternative exon  <dig> encodes an alternative version of the sequence after loop- <dig> .

the pdcmhc <dig> gene encodes a strongly reduced set of possible transcripts
the pediculus humanus corporis mhc <dig> gene contains the most reduced set of alternative exons . it has four sets of alternative exons each comprising two variants. however, the sequence encoding part of the converter domain, which is encoded by sets of three to five alternative exons in the other arthropod genes, has been fused to the following exon forming one constitutive exon in the pdcmhc <dig> gene . also, the part in the tail domain encoded by a set of two alternative exons in all other arthropod genes is represented by only one exon in the pdcmhc <dig> gene . altogether, the alternative exons encode for  <dig> different versions of the motor domain and  <dig> different mrnas of the pdcmhc <dig> gene, compared to potentially  <dig> different combinations of alternative exons for only the motor domain of the drosophila mhc <dig> gene.

conservation of alternatively spliced exons
the number of variants differs between the arthropod species for many of the alternatively spliced exons . for the first set of alternatively spliced exons two variants have been found in all mhc <dig> genes. both differ by two absolutely conserved residues, namely the amino acids alanine and aspartate at positions  <dig> and  <dig> in the "a" variants of the exon that are substituted by serine and asparagine in the "b" variants . a slightly less conserved marker for the "b" variants is a cysteine at position  <dig>  variant 3a of the dapmhc <dig> is an exception as it has an additional residue at the n-terminus compared to the other mhc <dig> variant "a" exons. the dapmhc <dig> gene encodes three clusters of alternatively spliced exons not found in the other arthropod mhc <dig> genes. for all three clusters exons variant "b" is more homologous to the corresponding amino acid sequences of the other mhc <dig> proteins than variant "a" . the alternatively spliced exons of bmmhc <dig>  dapmhc <dig>  pdcmhc <dig> and ticmhc <dig> covering loop- <dig> are different in length and starting position . however, the "a" variants are more similar to each other than to the "b" variants and the corresponding amino acid sequences of the other mhc <dig> proteins. thus, the common ancestor of bm, dap, and tic had in all probability already contained an "a" and a "b" variant. completely conserved residues characterizing the "a" variant are a serine at the end of loop- <dig>  a glutamate at position  <dig>  and a leucine at position  <dig> of the following helix . except for pdcmhc <dig>  all arthropod mhc <dig> genes have two variants of the mutually exclusively spliced exon in the tail . the most conserved differences between the two variants are an aspartate at position  <dig> in variant "b"  and an asparagine at position  <dig> . in addition, at position  <dig> the "b" variants have a large hydrophobic residue  while the "a" variants have a small polar residue . in contrast to the other mhc <dig> genes, the "a" variant of dapmhc <dig> is closer related to the "b" variants than to the other "a" variants.

the situation is more complex for the remaining clusters of mutually exclusive exons that contain three to six variants. the exon encoding a loop-helix motif adjacent to the atp-binding site  is not as conserved as the other alternatively spliced exons . therefore, it is difficult to identify characteristic residues/motifs for the respective variants. except for the pdcmhc <dig> and ticmhc <dig> genes all genes contain four variants. the variant with the most characteristic residues is variant "c". it is characterized by a positively charged residue at position  <dig> , a conserved arginine at position  <dig>  and a conserved asparagine at position  <dig>  none of these residues appear in any of the other variants at the respective positions. the ticmhc <dig>  pdcmhc <dig>  and dapmhc <dig> genes have lost this variant. the only strong characteristic of variant "d" is a conserved isoleucine or valine at position  <dig> that is found in all mhc <dig> genes. variants "a" and "b" do not contain any distinguishing residues.

the alternatively spliced exons spanning the relay helix and the relay loop are the longest and most conserved of the mutually exclusive exons . the variability ranges from two variants in the pediculus mhc <dig> gene to six variants in the nasonia gene . the least conserved part of the exon is the relay loop that is not embedded in the motor domain. in this region, characteristic residues for certain variants are found. variant "c" is characterized by a conserved glutamine at position  <dig> and either a glutamine or an asparagine at position  <dig>  a copy of this variant is present in all mhc <dig> genes except that of tic. another conserved variant is variant "d" characterized by a glutamine at position  <dig> followed by a proline at position  <dig>  this variant appears in the mhc <dig> genes of aea, ang, cpq, tic, and bm. similar to the situation for the alternatively spliced exon at the atp-binding site, the other variants are not conserved enough to define characteristic residues. it is thus not clear which were present in the ancient arthropod gene and which arose through exon duplication in the individual genes. again, the dapmhc <dig> is the exception because its first two variants, characterized by two conserved methionines at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  differ from all other variants.

the variants of the cluster of alternative exons encoding part of the converter domain also show a high degree of variability . two of the variants have characteristic features. variant "a" is the most conserved of the variants at the protein level having a conserved methionine at position  <dig> and a conserved cysteine at position  <dig>  these residues do not appear in any of the other variants of this cluster. variant "a" of this cluster is conserved in the mhc <dig> genes of all species and therefore must have been present in their common ancestor. the last of the variants has a characteristic feature at the dna level. the intron following the last variant always has a gt 5' splice site. this is in contrast to all other variants of this exon whose following introns have a gc 5' splice site. at the amino acid level this variant is characterized by a lysine at position  <dig>  a cysteine at position  <dig> and a glutamate at position  <dig> 

wherever est and/or cdna data was available a differentially excluded penultimate exon could be identified. these exons are very short  and not conserved , and therefore similar exons have not been predicted for the species for which est data is not available. for ang three carboxy-termini have been identified. based on est data the angmhc <dig> transcript may also end with a short extension to the antepenultimate exon. this c-terminus is similar to that found for aeamhc <dig> and cpqmhc <dig> and might be used in a similar combination of the other alternatively spliced exons.

phylogenetic analysis of the arthropod muscle myosin heavy chain genes
a phylogenetic tree of all arthropod mhc <dig> protein sequences, always incorporating the first variant of the clusters of alternatively spliced exons and excluding the differentially included penultimate exon, has been generated . in general, the tree reflects the phylogenetic relationship between the species. the aeamhc <dig> sequence is most closely related to the cpqmhc <dig> and the cpqmhc <dig> sequence implicating that the last common ancestor of aedes and culex already had one of these genes. the phylogeny of the drosophila species slightly differs compared to other analyses  <cit> . thus, the damhc <dig> sequence would have been expected to separate after the divergence of the dpmhc <dig> sequence. similarly, the dsemhc <dig> gene would have been expected to be the closest relative of the dssmhc <dig> sequence. overall, the sequence identity is very high. between dapmhc <dig> and the other sequences the identity is  <dig>  –  <dig> %, while it is between  <dig> % and  <dig> % between the other species.

predicting the gene structure of an ancient mhc <dig> gene
whenever intron positions are shared between the genes, the corresponding type of splice site is conserved, with the exception of the shared exon  <dig> , exon  <dig> , exon  <dig> , and the alternatively spliced exon  <dig> of dapmhc <dig> . all introns have consensus dinucleotide borders except those downstream of the last variant of the cluster of alternative exons encoding part of the motor domain , which have a gc dinucleotide at the 5' donor site instead of the consensus gt. the 3' exons of these alternatively spliced exons again have a consensus gt site. exon '10a' of aeamhc <dig> is almost identical to exon 10a of aeamhc <dig> and the following intron also has a gc dinucleotide at the 5' donor site. in contrast to the introns following the exons  <dig> of ammhc <dig>  navmhc <dig>  and bmmhc <dig>  and the intron following exon  <dig> of pdcmhc <dig> that have a consensus gt site, exon  <dig> of ticmhc <dig> has a gc 5' donor site. the intron following exon 11a of dapmhc <dig> starts with a consensus gt site, while the intron following exon 11b starts with the absolutely rare ga dinucleotide. also, all split codons are shared between the genes.

in the part encoding the motor and the neck domain, all intron positions are shared by at least two genes . in the coiled-coil tail domain, all genes have lost several introns so that the exons are considerably longer and the intron positions in many cases are not identical. assuming, that introns have in most cases been lost and were not gained during evolution  <cit> , an ancient arthropod mhc <dig> gene can be reconstructed . the ancient mhc <dig> gene is expected to contain all intron positions that appear in at least one of the analysed mhc <dig> genes. in the motor domain, the proposed ancient mhc <dig> gene structure completely resembles the dapmhc <dig> gene. the exon lengths are between  <dig> and  <dig> bp. the exons in the tail domain are considerably longer .

structural implications of the alternatively spliced exons
the locations of the alternatively spliced exons of dmmhc <dig> in the motor domain have been discussed in detail elsewhere  <cit> . the position of the additional alternatively spliced exons of the bmmhc <dig>  ticmhc <dig>  pdcmhc <dig>  and dapmhc <dig> genes in the structure of the motor domain are shown in figure  <dig>  the alternative exons of dapmhc <dig> encoding the structural part from the p-loop to loop- <dig> have identical p-loop sequences. the loop- <dig> sequences are identical in length but differ significantly in composition. studies have shown that the flexibility of this loop affects the rate of adp and phosphate release, with greater flexibility leading to an enhancement in the rate of product release  <cit> . although the amino acid composition is different between the alternative variants, both contain two glycines and a similar overall charge. the alternative exons of dapmhc <dig> including loop- <dig> are similar in length and composition. this region of the motor domain has not been investigated so far and therefore functional consequences of differences in the two variants cannot be drawn. loop- <dig> has been postulated to be important for the proper localization of class-i myosins that contain elongated loops that sterically interact with actin-binding proteins  <cit>  but the loop- <dig> sequences are almost identical between the two dapmhc <dig> variants and the two variants must therefore modulate a different property of the motor domain. the loop- <dig> sequence is modulated by alternative exons in the bmmhc <dig>  dapmhc <dig>  pdcmhc <dig>  and ticmhc <dig> genes. by studies of the dictyostelium class- <dig> myosin with its loop- <dig> replaced with the analogous loop from four other myosins with different enzymatic activities, loop- <dig> was shown to be involved in the weak and the strong binding interactions with actin  <cit> . it also plays an important role in the rate-limiting step of pi release  <cit> . the exon variants of the bmmhc <dig>  dapmhc <dig>  pdcmhc <dig>  and ticmhc <dig> genes encoding the loop- <dig> sequence have identical numbers of lysine and arginine residues. the "a" variants are always one residue shorter and have only four instead of five glycines. these differences are, however, very subtle and their influence on actin binding is expected to be very small. the variants of the alternative exon in dapmhc <dig> following loop- <dig> are very similar. this part of the motor domain has also not been investigated so far.

discussion
 <dig> muscle myosin heavy chain genes have been identified in  <dig> species of the arthropoda. all sequences share strong homology to the alternatively spliced mhc <dig> gene that was first described in drosophila melanogaster  <cit> . the genes contain five to nine clusters of mutually exclusive exons and an penultimate exon that might either be included or excluded in the mrna, and were assigned by manual inspection of the genomic dna sequences . because of the many clusters of alternatively spliced exons automatic identification of all exons failed. this is probably also the main reason for the wrong prediction of the exon organisation of the anopheles mhc <dig> gene .

altogether, alternative splicing of mhc <dig> transcripts could result in several hundred differently spliced mrnas . the pediculus mhc <dig> gene has the least alternatives for its alternatively spliced exons resulting in a theoretical maximum of  <dig> different mrnas, while the water flea gene could result in at least  <dig> different mrnas. thus, except for pediculus, nasonia, and apis mellifera all arthropod mhc <dig> genes, for which all exons could be identified, outscore the  <dig> mrna possibilities of drosophila melanogaster. although the number of possible transcripts seems vast compared to the number of different muscle myosin heavy chain genes in other metazoa species, the regions to modulate the function of the protein are limited to five to nine. in drosophila melanogaster, all alternative exons are expressed depending on the developmental stage, but only a limited number of combinations seem to be employed  <cit> . whether all alternative exons are expressed in the other arthropod species and which combinations are used has yet to be determined.

the phylogenetic analysis of the mhc <dig> protein sequences agrees with the expected phylogenetic relationship between the species. there are two notable exceptions in the drosophila species section of the tree. the dsemhc <dig> sequence would have been expected to be the closest relative of the dssmhc <dig> sequence, and the damhc <dig> sequence would have been expected to separate after the split of the dpmhc <dig> and drpmhc <dig> sequences. there are two possible ways to explain this observation. either, the mhc <dig> genes have evolved asynchronously as has been found for many yeast genes  <cit>  or the genes might have incorporated back-mutations. the sequence identities of  <dig>  to  <dig> % are very high, and thus only a few mutations would lead to a different phylogenetic classification.

the tribolium castaneum, pediculus humanus corporis, and bombyx mori mhc <dig> genes contain one additional and the daphnia pulex mhc <dig> gene contains four additional clusters of alternatively spliced exons compared to the drosophila melanogaster gene . all additional alternatively spliced exons are mutually exclusive and encode parts of the motor domain. the additional exons of the tic, pdc, and bm mhc <dig> genes encode alternative versions of the loop- <dig> sequence while the additional exons of the dap mhc <dig> gene are spread over the entire motor domain. in each case, the 3' variant is more homologous to the corresponding sequences in the other mhc <dig> genes than the 5' variant .

a similar conservation is found for alternative exons with multiple variants . in almost all cases, the most 3' variant is the most conserved one. of the cluster of alternative exons encoding part of the motor domain near the atp-binding site , the last of the variants is the only variant that is conserved in all species. the other variants are either missing in certain species, or are very similar to each other as well as to those of other species, so that it is not clear whether they have been derived from independent variant duplications or whether they were present in a common ancestor. thus, all variants except for the most 3' variant evolved after the separation of daphnia from the other species. the variants encoding the relay-helix and the relay-loop are highly conserved. conserved differences confine to only one or two residues. the penultimate of the variants seems to be the most conserved, although mutation of one residue might change this. the exon encoding part of the converter domain has two highly conserved variants, the most 5' and the most 3' variants. the most 3' variant is distinguished from all other variants of this set of alternative exons at the dna level because the following intron starts with a gt donor site. the most 5' exon is the most important, though not the only, determinant for flight capabilities  <cit> .

based on the exon-intron patterns of the  <dig> mhc <dig> genes the gene structure of the ancient arthropod mhc <dig> gene can be predicted. the prediction is based on the assumption that it is very unlikely that the different species, distributed over a broad taxonomic range, invented introns at the same positions independently from each other. in the first half of the genes encoding the motor and the neck domain, all intron positions are shared by at least two genes . the exons encoding the coiled-coil tail domain starting at amino acid  <dig> are considerably longer and the intron positions in almost all genes are not identical. it is highly probable that further sequencing of arthropod mhc <dig> genes will reveal different exon-intron patterns in the tail region while intron positions with one or more of the already analysed genes will be shared. comparing the intron rich dapmhc <dig> and pdcmhc <dig> genes with the mosquito and drosophila mhc <dig> genes, it is apparent that intron loss is a major determinant of arthropod mhc <dig> gene evolution. loss of intron events have also been found for many other arthropod genes  <cit> . however, as long as data from further arthropod species is missing, it cannot be excluded that some of the introns in the tail region, that are not shared between the analyzed arthropods, have been gained during evolution. very recently, an analysis of eleven drosophila genomes showed, that a small number of introns have been gained in these species  <cit> . the ancient mhc <dig> gene is expected to contain all intron positions that appear in at least one of the analysed mhc <dig> genes. analysis of mhc <dig> genes of further species might add additional intron positions especially in the tail region. the exon lengths of the ancient mhc <dig> gene are between  <dig> and  <dig> bp in the motor domain and up to  <dig> bp in the tail region. these short exons  resemble exon lengths in vertebrates and further comparative analysis with vertebrate muscle myosin heavy chain genes will reveal the gene structure of the ancient metazoa gene.

in addition to the mhc <dig> gene, aedes aegypti encodes a further muscle myosin heavy chain gene, named mhc <dig> that encodes only one variant of each of the alternatively spliced exons of the mhc <dig> gene. the presence of this gene is not an artefact from sequencing or the assembly process. both genes, mhc <dig> and mhc <dig>  are very different at the dna level, and both are confirmed by several est clones, although the translated exons show high identities. that also means, that the mhc <dig> gene, that does not encode any alternatively spliced exons, is expressed during the life cycle of aedes aegypti. however, there is not enough data that shows that the mhc <dig> gene is expressed in a biological important  manner. note that the combination of alternatively spliced exons does not correspond to any of the tissue-specific combinations found in drosophila  <cit> . the culex pipiens quinquefasciatus genome contains another two muscle myosin heavy chain genes in addition to the mhc <dig> gene, named mhc <dig> and mhc <dig>  that, similarly to aeamhc <dig>  encode only one variant of most of the alternatively spliced exons of the mhc <dig> gene. in one case, the intron between the presumed variant of the alternatively spliced exons and the following constitutive exon disappeared. unfortunately, there is not enough est data available for culex pipiens quinquefasciatus to support any of the myosin heavy chain genes. aeamhc <dig>  cpqmhc <dig>  and cpqmhc <dig> retained the same variants of the alternative exons of the corresponding mhc <dig> genes. the presence of these further muscle myosin heavy chain genes is very surprising because the number of alternatively spliced exons in the mhc <dig> genes already allows for the transcription of several hundred different muscle myosin isoforms. how could it happen that the genomes of aedes aegypti and culex pipiens quinquefasciatus encode such genes? according to the phylogenetic tree of the myosin heavy chain genes, the mhc <dig> and mhc <dig> genes obviously appeared in the common ancester of aedes and culex after the divergence from anopheles gambiae. in addition, there is no evidence for a  second muscle myosin heavy chain gene in the anopheles gambiae genome. also, the carboxy-terminal ends of aeamhc <dig> and cpqmhc <dig>  that are 3' elongations of the last constitutive exon, do not exist in the aeamhc <dig> and cpqmhc <dig> genes but have an identical counterpart in the angmhc <dig> gene that is also supported by several est clones. it is unlikely that these three organisms have developed such a carboxy-terminal end of the myosin gene independently from each other. instead, it is more probable that the ancient aeamhc <dig> and cpqmhc <dig> genes have lost this specific carboxy-terminus after incorporation of the mhc <dig> and mhc <dig> genes into the genome. this would mean that this carboxy-terminus is only used in the specific combination of alternatively spliced exons as found in the aeamhc <dig> and cpqmhc <dig> genes. whether this is also true for the angmhc <dig> gene has to be verified. based on their identity in sequence and gene structure it is most probable that cpqmhc <dig> has been derived by gene duplication of cpqmhc <dig> or cpqmhc <dig> is a duplication of cpqmhc <dig> 

there are two possibilities as to how the mhc <dig> and mhc <dig> genes could have appeared in the common ancestor of aedes and culex. the genes have either been derived from a duplication of the mhc <dig> gene as part of a single gene or chromosomal region duplication event. or, a partially spliced transcript of mhc <dig> has been reincorporated into the genome . if the mhc <dig> and mhc <dig> genes had been derived from duplication, then all variants except one of the alternative exons of only one of the  two mhc genes had to be lost in addition to the loss of both terminal exons in mhc <dig>  given the number of possible transcripts of the mhc <dig> gene and the possibility to duplicate alternative exons, it is very unlikely that there would be a need for a second gene with the same set of alternative exons. if it were advantageous to keep two almost identical genes, it would be very unlikely that only one of the genes has lost all except one of its alternative exons. in addition, there must have been a very strong evolutionary pressure to keep exactly this special combination of alternative exons. the second possibility would mean that in the first step during the splicing process all alternatively spliced exons, which are not needed, are removed leaving introns between the remaining alternatively spliced and constitutive exons . in the second step, all introns are spliced to yield the mrna for translation. in the case of the mhc <dig> and mhc <dig> genes, the transcript containing one combination of alternative exons but all introns would have been integrated into the genome, probably after retrotranscription. how should this type of genes be called? at least the aeamhc <dig> gene is completely transcribed, and also cpqmhc <dig> and cpqmhc <dig> do not contain any premature stop codons or frameshift mutations. however, compared to the corresponding mhc <dig> genes they retained only one variant exon of each of the alternative exons. thus, they do not belong to the non-processed pseudogenes. we would rather regard them as a new type of partially processed pseudogenes.

CONCLUSIONS
 <dig> arthropod muscle myosin heavy chain genes have been identified and analysed. compared to the well-studied gene of drosophila melanogaster other arthropod genes might contain up to four additional alternatively spliced exons encoding part of the motor domain. this considerably extends the possibilities of other arthropod species to fine-tune myosin and thus muscle characteristics. an ancient arthropod muscle myosin heavy chain gene has been reconstructed whose gene structure can best be explained if introns are lost and not gained during evolution of this gene. aedes aegypti and culex pipiens quinquefasciatus even encode further muscle myosin heavy chain genes that, however, have lost all except one variant of the alternatively spliced exons. these genes most probably entered the genome by reincorporating a certain processed transcript and not via a gene or genomic region duplication event. if the gene has been derived from a processed transcript then splicing of alternative exons must involve a first step, in which all other variants are spliced out leaving intronic sequence around the variant of choice. in a second step, all introns are spliced.
