BACKGROUND
somatic cell nuclear transfer  has been used to produce live clones in  <dig> mammalian genera . live animals were also cloned by interspecific , and intersubspecific scnt . the transmission of donor-cell mtdna to the clonal offspring was addressed in four mammalian species  <cit> .

mature oocytes in different mammalian species contain on average  <dig>  to  <dig>  ×  <dig> mtdna copies  <cit> . a threshold of about  <dig>  mtdna copy numbers must be exceeded for fertilisation to ensue in mouse, human and pig . in contrast, mtdna copy numbers in somatic cells vary substantially ranging from several hundred to several thousand  <cit> . recipient oocytes have around  <dig> to  <dig> times more mtdna copies than donor cells based on copy number ratios of  <dig> % to  <dig> %  <cit> . therefore the resultant scnt clones are assumed to have nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of different origins and to be slightly heteroplasmic based on the quantitative participation of mtdna from the two partners and on equal replication of their mitochondrial genomes. nucleus donor-derived mtdna was transmitted to most cattle, mouse or pig clones  <cit> , including the germline of one scnt pig  <cit> . quantitative studies on scnt-derived fetuses and offspring revealed levels of heteroplasmy between  <dig> and 13%  <cit>  indicating neutral transmission of mtdnas of the nuclear donor and the oocyte recipient. however, higher contributions up to 40% attributed to a replicative advantage of donor mtdna have also been observed  <cit> . these data demonstrate that donor mtdna transmission is not prevented in scnt and are concordant with the detection of somatic cell-derived mtdna in offspring produced by assisted reproductive techniques like ooplasm transfer  <cit> . however, in dolly and nine other cloned sheep donor mtdna could not be detected  <cit> .

the existence of heteroplasmic clones is contrary to the unimaternal inheritance of mtdna during mammalian sexual reproduction  <cit> . the mechanism of paternal mitochondrial elimination involves the proteasome of oocytes, which recognizes mitochondria that have been ubiquitinated during spermatogenesis  <cit> . for sexually reproduced mammals there are few exceptions from this strict exclusion including reports of interspecies mouse hybrids  <cit> , a human patient with mitochondrial myopathy  <cit> , and the offspring of a single small-tail han sheep crossed to two rams of dorset breed  <cit> .

in this work, we re-investigated the issue of the failure to detect donor mtdna transmission into cloned offspring in ovies aries reported previously  <cit> . in addition to this previous report, our snp quantification method included an intra-assay standard controlling for the detection limit reached in each run. to further increase discrimination sensitivity, we developed a restriction endonuclease-mediated selective quantitative pcr  protocol. both quantification approaches identified donor mtdna transmission to ovine clones demonstrating the lack of a species-specific mechanism preventing transmission to scnt sheep. in addition, we analysed complete mitochondrial genomes for amino acid changes being specific for high-level heteroplasmy found in another clone.

RESULTS
transmission of donor mtdna to the clonal offspring
we investigated the transmission of nucleus donor cell mtdna to twelve ovine scnt clones , which were generated from three sources of primary fetal fibroblasts . samples were taken from fetuses , live lambs  and from a lamb put down post partum  .

n.d., not detectable

culturing cells in vitro under standard, high-glucose conditions with sodium pyruvate and non-dialised fetal bovine serum supplementation was reported to reduce mtdna copy number  <cit> . to estimate the expected levels of heteroplasmy in scnt clones in case of neutral transmission of parental mtdnas, we quantified the mtdna copy numbers per cell for the three primary fetal fibroblast donors cultured for several passages under similar conditions before scnt. copy numbers obtained  were comparable to those found in somatic cells of murine fetuses between days  <dig>  and  <dig>  post conceptionem  or in ovine fetal primary fibroblasts cultured long-term . however, they were lower than those found in earlier cultures derived from the latter genotype , in cultured goat fetal fibroblasts at different points in time  or in adult human primary fibroblasts .

to identify snps that could be used for detection of donor mtdna transmission by arms-qpcr, we sequenced the mitochondrial control region and the mtdna genes mt-nd4l, mt-co <dig> and mt-co <dig> for the somatic donors and their clones. the phylogenetic tree constructed with these sequences demonstrates a random maternal origin of the biological material . only the recipient oocytes used to clone ca <dig>  ca <dig> and ca <dig> were derived from the same maternal lineage or individual. this was additionally confirmed with sequences of the complete mitochondrial genome . donor mtdna-specific polymorphisms were selected for assay design of arms-qpcr and the novel rems-qpcr . we identified seven heteroplasmic sheep clones  among the twelve screened. in three cloned lambs  we found at least two heteroplasmic tissues with  <dig>  to  <dig> % donor mtdna . in the heteroplasmic cloned fetuses we quantified low  or high  levels of heteroplasmy . there was no mtdna substitution associated with transmission or non-transmission of donor mtdna to the clones .

chimerism in the blood of some bovine fetuses generated by in vitro techniques was attributed to maternal-fetal transfer of genetic material across an epitheliochorial placenta  <cit> . the two blood streams of all chorioallantoic placental types – epitheliochorial, synepitheliochorial, endotheliochorial and haemochorial – have areas of comparable proximity reducing the diffusion distance  <cit> . the reduction of interhaemal area varies in part with placental type  <cit> . in epitheliochorial  and synepitheliochorial  placentae, capillary indenting of both trophoblast and uterine epithelium decreases the interhaemal distance  <cit> . therefore, this issue was assessed in order to exclude the possibility of foster-mother mtdna transfer. four pairs of foster mother/cloned lamb were analysed . foster mother-specific arms-qpcr assays  were designed on the basis of snps identified by sequencing the mitochondrial control region. we did not detect any foster-mother mtdna in these four clones , at a detection limit ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> %. note that donor-cell-derived heteroplasmy in the clone ca <dig>  was quantified at  <dig> c. for the heteroplasmic clones where foster-mother material was not available , the assignment of mtdna genotypes to somatic donor cells was based on quantification of heteroplasmy at two rare, donor-specific substitutions.

high-level heteroplasmy in clone ca5
we addressed factors which could have been responsible for the high levels of heteroplasmy determined in ca <dig> . first, we assessed the possibility of a foster mother-derived origin of this high level of heteroplasmy. since biological material from the foster mother of clone ca <dig> was unavailable, we inferred donor transmission based on snp analysis across the entire mitochondrial genome. all diagnostic snps  for the donor and oocyte-derived mtdnas were heteroplasmic in clone ca <dig>  including some found at frequencies < 5% in the sheep population. thus, an alternative origin of the heteroplasmy is exceedingly unlikely.

next, we assessed the complete mtdna genomes of donor a and its clones since polymorphisms in mtdna can influence segregation of mammalian mtdna independently from nuclear genes  <cit> . no polymorphism corresponded to either presence  or absence  of donor mtdna . the highly heteroplasmic clone ca <dig> possessed the most divergent mtdna variant of the donor da-derived clones. it differed in three rare amino acid changes not found in other sheep sequences . the change asn125asp in the gene mt-co <dig> occurred at a site completely conserved in human  and highly conserved among  <dig> vertebrate species . with the exception of hedgehog  that seems to be most divergent in this extramembranous loop important for cytochrome c oxidase activity  <cit> , the only variant occuring at this site in mammalia is a asn/asp change seen in a few species . the other two amino acid changes found in the clone ca <dig>  affected less conserved sites .

discussion
here we applied one  and developed another  state-of-the-art techniques for mtdna quantification to demonstrate donor mtdna transmission in somatic sheep clones for the first time . rems-qpcr revealed a discrimination limit of  <dig> %, and is thus one of the most sensitive methods for quantitative detection of snp sequences. it offers increased power for discrimination of snp sequences compared to arms-qpcr and their variations  <cit> . application of rems-qpcr was essential to identify low-level heteroplasmies of  <dig>  and  <dig> % in two of the three nuclear donor b-derived clones analysed in this work . these two clones were derived from the donor b harbouring only about half of the mtdna copies per cell determined for the nuclear donor a . the twofold higher mtdna copy number found in the cells of donor a is concordant with slightly higher levels of heteroplasmy found in donor a-derived heteroplasmic clones, indicating neutral transmission of the donor mtdna . these levels of donor mtdna-derived heteroplasmy are in agreement with the general picture that the majority of investigated scnt-derived fetuses and offspring displays either undetectable levels of donor mtdna or only mild heteroplasmy, which is consistent with neutral segregation of donor mtdna  <cit> . it is highly likely that our improved snp discrimination limits finally resulted in detecting donor mtdna, which was not detected in an earlier study applying less discriminative methods  <cit> .

the failure to detect donor mtdna in seven other sheep cloned from a fetal fibroblast origin , i.e. the same source of somatic donor cells as used here, still remains unresolved. again, a low mtdna copy number per donor cell in combination with an insufficiently discriminative quantification method can not be excluded. likewise, cryopreservation of the donor cell immediately before scnt  which did not allow the mitochondria to sufficiently recover from cryopreservation-induced oxydative stress or damage should be taken into account. cryopreservation of oocytes, somatic and embryonic cells leads to a decrease of the mitochondrial membrane potential  <cit> , which is an indicator of overall mitochondrial function. moreover, cryopreservation is known to be responsible for the increased production of reactive oxygen species . reactive oxygen species-induced oxidative stress leads to cell cycle arrest and changes in mtdna copy number  <cit> . if donor cells were allowed to "recover" from cryopreservation over several passages before scnt, the transmission of their mtdna was not circumvented  <cit> .

in this work all clones analysed were produced from early-passage fetal fibroblasts without cryopreservation.

mammalian mtdna segregation is controled by nuclear and mitochondrial genomes  <cit> . from previous work it can be concluded that different sources of recipient oocytes – genetically identical or random – can increase the chance to produce divergent segregation patterns of donor mtdna in scnt. genetically identical recipient oocytes used to produce intersubspecific scnt mice resulted in heteroplasmy levels of a few percent . in contrast, a study with genetically random-source recipient oocytes in cattle included two scnt clones with a significant increase of donor mtdna  <cit> .

we also produced different patterns of donor mtdna transmission using an identical nuclear background  in combination with recipient oocytes with different mtdna. beside undetectable  or neutral transmission , a single case with a high degree of nuclear donor-derived heteroplasmy was observed . heteroplasmies detected in some of the tissues analysed for the fetus ca <dig> are higher than those found in  <dig> heteroplasmic ovine embryos cloned by fusing enucleated oocytes of random genetic origin with ovine fetal primary fibroblasts . our results show that high-level heteroplasmy can also occur in sheep following scnt. similar results have been obtained earlier for a bovine fetus and a calf cloned from cumulus cells , calf: 40% ,  <cit> ). authors attributed this high heteroplasmy to a replicative advantage of donor over recipient-oocyte mtdna  <cit> . in addition to the latter report, this work is the first to provide mtdna coding region sequences for a highly heteroplasmic scnt clone and relates the obviously favoured proliferation of donor mtdna to a divergent mitochondrial genotype . irrespective of the polymorphism frequency in the local sheep herds used as recipient-oocyte source or of evolutionary conservation which are not decisive criteria to classify a variant as mildly deleterious  <cit> , we speculate that one or several predicted amino acid changes of this mtdna variant could have caused suboptimal nucleo-mitochondrial interaction with the nucleus of donor a by affecting functions of the mitochondrially encoded protein subunits inside and/or outside of the mitochondrion  <cit> .

a certain level of variability in mtdna segregation has to be taken into account for embryo reconstruction  <cit> . however, we believe that the 'non-pathological' mtdna variant of ca <dig>  which encodes one or several amino acid changes represents a promising new genetic candidate to study mtdna proliferation, nucleo-mitochondrial interaction or the selective preference of some cell types for a given mitochondrial genotype  <cit> .

in this work mitochondrial genomes with up to about  <dig> % sequence divergence were mixed by scnt. heteroplasmic mice carrying mitochondrial genotypes of mus musculus domesticus and mus musculus brevirostris  with a sequence divergence of  <dig> %  have been described as normal and healthy, as no overtly abnormal phenotype was observed  <cit> . the level of heteroplasmy in these mouse models did not appear to affect the capacity for oxidative phosphorylation at the level of the organelle  <cit> . however, differences were detected when physiological parameters of heteroplasmic mice carrying a mixture of the same mtdna genotypes at levels between  <dig> and 56% were studied in greater detail  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
following a report describing the potential of sheep scnt embryos to harbour donor mtdna throughout preimplantation development  <cit> , this is the first report demonstrating donor mtdna transmission to fetuses or sheep cloned by scnt . our data are concordant with reported heteroplasmy in bovine, murine and porcine scnt clones  <cit> . thus, we demonstrate that there is no species-specific effect in sheep, which prevents transmission of nucleus donor-derived mtdna into clonal offspring.
