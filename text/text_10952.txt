BACKGROUND
streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae are major causes of community-acquired pneumonia   <cit>  and as neisseria meningitidis they are important agents of meningitis  <cit> . identification of the microbiological cause of cap and meningitis is important, as it enables pathogen-directed antibiotic therapy. conventional detection of bacteria is based on culture and phenotypic characterization. however, culture methods are time-consuming and have relatively low sensitivity, especially when antibiotics have been given to the patient prior to sampling  <cit> . the use of nucleic acid amplification tests, such as quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction , have enabled more sensitive and rapid detection of pathogens in respiratory secretions and cerebrospinal fluid .

several qpcr assays for the detection of s. pneumoniae  <cit> , h. influenzae  <cit>  and n. meningitidis  <cit>  have been developed and multiplex detection of several target dnas in a single tube is achievable  <cit> . still, the specificity of methods used is an underestimated problem and commonly used targets have been shown to be unspecific and causing misleading results. an illustrative example is the pneumolysin  gene for the detection of s. pneumoniae  <cit> . for detection of h. influenzae, a species with frequent exchange of genetic elements, the problem is even worse and most target genes used are problematic. the bexa is not present in all strains of h. influenzae  <cit> , while  <dig> s rrna and rnpb do not provide specific detection  <cit> . we have recently developed qpcrs for specific detection of s. pneumoniae, based on the spn <dig> fragment  <cit> , and for the detection of h. influenzae, based on the outer membrane protein p <dig>  <cit> . real time pcr assays for detection of n. meningitidis have been based on genes as pora  <cit>  and ctra  <cit> .

here we present a new quantitative multiplex pcr  method for detection of s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae and n. meningitidis. the method was evaluated on a collection of bronchoalveolar lavage  and cerebrospinal fluid specimens for detection of lower respiratory tract infection  and meningitis due to these three bacteria species.

methods
patients and controls
from  <dig> through  <dig>   <dig> consecutively identified immunocompetent adult patients who were hospitalised for lrti at the department of internal medicine, silkeborg county hospital, silkeborg, denmark, were enrolled in a prospective study  <cit> . the criteria for lrti were fever and/or an increased leukocyte count , together with increased focal symptoms from the lower airways with at least one of three newly developed symptoms of increased dyspnoea, increased coughing and/or increased sputum purulence.

the enrolled patients underwent standardized fibre-optic bronchoscopy within  <dig> hours from admission. for the present study, bal fluid was available in  <dig> patients, median age  <dig> years . a chronic lung disease was documented in  <dig> patients , 31% were current and 40% were previous smokers. new x-ray infiltrates were identified in  <dig> patients . antibiotics had been taken within  <dig> days prior to bronchoscopy in  <dig> cases .

as controls,  <dig> adult patients, median age  <dig> years , who consecutively underwent fibre-optic bronchoscopy for suspected malignancy and who did not have pulmonary infection were included. nineteen of them had lung malignancies and  <dig> had no pathology identified by bronchoscopy or radiological examinations. twenty-seven controls  were current or previous smokers.

csf samples sent for culture to the bacteriological laboratory, sahlgrenska university hospital, gothenburg, sweden during a four year period were used in the study. specimens were eligible if the total csf white blood cell  count was ≥ <dig> ×  <dig> /l indicating meningeal inflammation. only one csf sample from each patient was included. medical records of all patients included in the study were reviewed retrospectively for a final diagnosis, predisposing factors, treatment and outcome by one doctor. all  <dig> specimens were included in a study previously published for  <dig> s rrna gene pcr  <cit>  and the relevance of the pcr findings and bacterial cultures to the final diagnosis was evaluated and compared with the clinical findings and other laboratory results. the median age of the patients were  <dig> years .

fibre-optic bronchoscope
in brief, the fibre-optic bronchoscope was introduced through the nose or through the mouth. the tip of the bronchoscope was wedged into the segment of bronchus affected by a pulmonary infiltrate, or, if no infiltrate was available, into the middle lobe. a sterile, thin tube was then introduced into the working channel of the bronchoscope, and lavage was then performed. one to three portions of  <dig> ml of isotonic nacl were used for lavage, and the aspirated fluid was collected in one single portion for microbiological analyses.

conventional diagnostic methods
bal fluid from the lrti patients and the controls were analysed with culture  at the department of clinical microbiology, aarhus university hospital , within a maximum of  <dig> h from the time of sampling. the specimens were cultured on 5% horse blood agar and chocolate agar with semi-quantitative determinations by dispersion of  <dig> and  <dig> μl on each half of the plate. the plates were incubated in 5% carbon dioxide at 35°c for 24- <dig> h.

from  <dig> lrti patients, blood samples were collected for culture with a bactec blood-culturing system  at the department of clinical microbiology, aarhus university hospital. non-frozen urine samples collected from  <dig> lrti patients were sent to the department of bacteriology, mycology and parasitology, statens serum institute, copenhagen, denmark, and were analyzed for pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides by countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis  <cit> .

csf samples were submitted for routine bacterial culture and chemistry  <cit> .

dna extraction
dna from  <dig> - <dig>  ml bal was extracted by the automatic magna pure lc dna-isolation system . bacteria dna used for determination of the analytical sensitivity of the spn <dig> and the p <dig> pcrs was purified from cultured isolates  by phenol-chloroform extraction of bacteria harvested in exponential growth phase after culturing on chocolate agar at 37°c in 5% carbon dioxide and the concentration of dna was determined by a nanodrop instrument . the genome copy number was determined according to conventional calculations based on molecular weight and one gene copy per genome.

csf samples  were centrifuged at  <dig>  <dig> g for  <dig> min, after which dna was extracted from the pellet with a bacterial dna preparation kit , used according to the manufacturer's instructions.

qmpcr
the quantitative spn <dig> pcr for the detection of s. pneumoniae  <cit>  was combined with the p <dig> pcr for the detection of h. influenzae  <cit>  and the ctra pcr for the detection of neisseria meningitidis  <cit> . all primers and probes are shown in table  <dig> where positions with lower case letters indicate locked nucleic acid  <cit> .

a positions with lower case letters indicate locked nucleic acid  <cit> .

the pcr for detection of n. meningitidis was used as described previously, except that  <dig>  mmol/l mgcl <dig> was used instead of  <dig>  mmol/l and that the elongation time was  <dig> s instead of  <dig> min. all primers and probes were obtained from thermo hybaid, interactiva division  except the spn <dig> fam probe which was obtained from eurogentec, seraing, belgium.

the real-time pcr assay was performed in a rotor-gene  <dig> instrument . the optimized real-time pcr amplifications were performed in 25-μl reactions containing  <dig>  μmol/l of each primer,  <dig>  μmol/l of the spn <dig> fam probe,  <dig> μmol/l of the p <dig> joe probe and ctra rox probe,  <dig>  mmol/l mgcl <dig>   <dig>  mmol/l deoxynucleoside triphosphate, and  <dig> u hotstar taq polymerase  in pcr buffer. a total of  <dig> μl of target dna was used in the assay. the qmpcr was performed according to the following program:  <dig> min of enzyme activation at 95°c, followed by  <dig> cycles of 95°c for  <dig> s and 60°c for  <dig> s.

reproducibility of analytical sensitivity and quantification
the analytical sensitivity of the spn <dig>  p <dig> and ctra pcrs was determined by serial dilutions of target dna in carrier trna . two experiments were performed with  <dig> to  <dig> genome copies per reaction tube and  <dig> to  <dig> tubes of each dilution.

the reproducibility of quantification was evaluated by testing dna preparations with known concentrations  in five consecutive runs and also in  <dig> bal samples and in  <dig> csf samples. pcrs with primer/probe reagents in both monoplex and multiplex were tested in parallel. in addition we tested the reproducibility of quantification with positive control dna of s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae and n. meningitidis in separate tubes and combined in a single tube.

fuck pcr
the fuck pcr was used as previously described  <cit> , to confirm the presence of h. influenzae in samples which proved negative by culture but positive by qmpcr.

lyta pcr
for respiratory samples the lyta pcr was tested in a gel based pcr for s. pneumoniae as previously described  <cit> . in short, extracted dna  was added to a pcr mixture, and after  <dig> cycles, pcr products were detected on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels. by serial dilution of bacterial strains, the detection level of lyta pcr has been shown to be  <dig> colony forming units /ml sample  <cit> .

 <dig> s rrna pcr for csf samples
the primers and other pcr conditions used to amplify the 5'-half of the  <dig> s rrna gene were previously described  <cit> . the pcr product was visualized in an agarosegel and dna bands of expected size were cut from the gel, purified with a qiaquick gel extraction kit  and subjected to cycle sequencing using the abi prism big dye terminator sequencing ready reaction kit, v. <dig>  . the sequencing reaction products were analyzed using an abi prism  <dig> genetic analyser . after dna sequence editing, the genbank blast program was used for sequence comparisons.

ethics
the study was performed according to the declaration of helsinki ii and approved by the local ethical committee and all participating patients gave written consent.

RESULTS
a sensitive and specific multiplex pcr for quantitative detection of s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae and n. meningitidis was developed and evaluated on bal samples from adults with lrti and a control group, and on csf samples from patients with meningitis. to establish the detection capacity of the spn <dig>  the p <dig> and the ctra assays, serial dilutions of target dna with known concentration were repeatedly tested and the analytical sensitivity was 10- <dig> copies per pcr reaction for the spn <dig> assay, 3- <dig> copies per pcr reaction for the p <dig> assay and 5- <dig> copies per pcr reaction for the ctra assay. as shown in table  <dig> the analytical sensitivity and quantification was not affected by using a combined mixture of reagents and a combined dna standard  in single tubes.

discussion
in this study we established a sensitive detection system that enabled simultaneous quantification of s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae and n. meningitidis dna using qmpcr. the multiplex assay was reproducible and no change in detection and quantification capacity was seen when a combined mixture of reagents and a combined dna standard  in single tubes was used . this multiplex pcr assay reduced the expense of reagents and the required time for analysis.

antibiotic treatment prior sampling has been found to reduce the positivity rate of bal culture from 92% to 55% in patients with severe community acquired pneumonia  <cit> . in this study 66%  of the patients had antibiotic therapy prior the sampling, this high rate of antibiotic treatment is probably the reason for the suboptimal specificity of the qmpcr. of  <dig> samples which were negative by culture and positive for s. pneumoniae or h. influenzae by the qmpcr,  <dig> were treated with antibiotic 0- <dig> days prior to sampling. the high rate of prior antibiotic treatment was probably also the reason for the lack of correlation between dna concentration and bacterial concentration determined by semi-quantitative culture . this lack of correlation between quantification of target dna and culture contrasts to our previous analysis of nasopharyngeal aspirates from community acquired pneumonia patients, where a significant correlation was seen, but only 25% of patients were on antibiotic treatment when samples were collected in the previous study  <cit> .

the evaluation of nucleic acid amplification tests by comparison with less sensitive reference methods such as culture is problematic. several imperfect tests may be used to define a composite reference standard  <cit> . an alternative way to resolve cases with different test results is to use discrepant analysis where an additional method is used to determine the specimen status. such analyses have been criticized  <cit> , but is often the most realistic procedure for the evaluation of new methods that are more sensitive than an established reference method. in our study the spn <dig> target was evaluated by a composite reference standard and for the p <dig> target discrepant analysis was used. this resulted in increased specificity and a higher number of pneumonia cases with defined etiology. as expected the positive predictive values increase with increased specificity, thus with a cut-off limit of  <dig> copies/ml a positive pcr result is very reliable using an extended reference standard.

we have recently shown that spn <dig> pcr and p <dig> pcr are specific for s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae when bacterial strains have been tested.

nevertheless, colonization of s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae in the respiratory tract is problematic for both culture and pcr. to overcome this problem semi-quantitative culture is often used. in our study a detection limit of  <dig> dna copies/ml for positive spn <dig> and p <dig> pcrs yielded a high specificity but somewhat reduced the sensitivity. similar results have been seen in previous studies  <cit>  based on bal culture and demonstrated that a cut-off of 104- <dig> cfu/ml allow differentiation between colonization and infection of the lower respiratory tract. however, cfu/ml does not automatically correspond to the number of dna copies/ml since several bacteria may aggregate and generate one colony although they constitute several genome equivalents. furthermore, as described above antibiotic treatment before sampling and smoking habits have an effect on the number of detected bacteria. thus patient treatment and the patient group characteristics affect the possibility of using quantification to differentiate between colonization and infection.

when the multiplex pcr was applied on csf samples, our assay was able to detect all the cases of n. meningitidis and s. pneumoniae that were found by culture and/or  <dig> s pcr in a previous study  <cit> . the problem of choosing optimal targets for s. pneumonia and h. influenzae has been addressed above. the primer pair used for n. meningitidis in our assay has previously been used in a multiplex assay for detection of bacterial meningitis  <cit>  and even been evaluated in a major interlaboratory comparison of pcr-based identification of meningococci  <cit>  as well as in other studies with satisfying results  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
although culture is still indispensable in bacteriological diagnostics multiplex pcr enables concurrent diagnostics of viruses and fungi and provides a powerful tool for analysis. we conclude that the multiplex format of the assay facilitates diagnostics of s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae and n. meningitidis and is suitable for analysis of both respiratory tract tract and csf specimens. the assay also enable detection after antibiotic treatment has been installed. quantification increases the specificity of etiology for pneumonia.
