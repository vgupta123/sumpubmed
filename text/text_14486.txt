BACKGROUND
the orchidaceae is one of the largest and most widespread families of flowering plants, with more than  <dig> species  <cit> . cymbidium, a very important economically flowering genus with the orchidaceae, has nearly  <dig> species throughout the world and is widespread in tropical and subtropical asia, reaching as far south as papua new guinea and australia  <cit> . cymbidium sinense is a perennial terrestrial species native to china and has more than a thousand years of cultural history. it holds a strong position in traditional flower markets in china, japan, korea, and southeast asia. it is of great horticultural value as an ornamental plant because of its elegance, its upright leaves, and beautiful and fragrant flowers. c. sinense blooms in winter from january to march and is usually regarded as a spring festival flower. although c. sinense is a valuable orchid, its flowering pathway is not clearly understood. variation in environmental conditions, including light, temperature and hormones, is likely to regulate flowering time and flower quality. flowering regulation technology for c. sinense is currently scarce on the market, which seriously hinders the development of the orchid industry and also reduces the economic value of c. sinense.

the transition from vegetative growth to flowering is very importance because flowering is the first step of sexual reproduction  <cit> . in arabidopsis thaliana, flower initiation takes place via four  genetic pathways. these processes are integrated by the function of the flowering locus d , flowering locus e , flowering wageningen , protodermal factor <dig> , suppressor of overexpression of co  <dig>  and flowering locus t  genes. the integrated signal of floral induction is transmitted to the floral meristem identity genes leaty  and apetala <dig> , after which floral morphogenesis takes place  <cit> . currently only a few flowering genes have been cloned from orchids. doh <dig> and domads <dig> were isolated and identified from dendrobium madame. doh <dig> plays a negative regulatory role in floral formation while domads <dig> is a marker gene specifically expressed in the shoot apical meristem during floral transition. doh <dig> is a possible upstream regulator of domads <dig> and inhibits its expression  <cit> . some mads-box function genes were also isolated from dendrobium crumenatum. they include apetala <dig> , pistillata /globosa , apetala <dig>  /defience -like, agamous  and sepallata  genes, which play an important role in the early regulation of the conversion to flowers  <cit> . omads <dig> was isolated and characterized from oncidium gower ramsey with a function similar to a functional gene regulating flower formation as well as floral initiation  <cit> . omads <dig> from o. gower ramsey promoted flower transition and formation by acting as an activator for ft and soc <dig> in arabidopsis. omads <dig> was able to strongly interact with omads <dig>  which influenced flower formation and floral initiation  <cit> .

compared with other orchids, very little research exists on the role of flowering genes in the regulation of the vegetative-to-flowering transition and flower initiation in cymbidium. few reports investigating the functions of flowering time genes of cymbidium exist. genomic resources available for the species are also scarce. together with the nucleotide sequences obtained by ncbi searches,  <dig> cymbidium expressed sequence tags  are, however, available. nevertheless, this genetic data is insufficient for elucidating the molecular mechanism of floral regulation in c. sinense.

in recent years, illumina sequencing techniques have provided fascinating opportunities in life sciences and dramatically improved the efficiency of gene discovery. however, the entire transcriptome of c. sinense has not been sequenced. in this study, rna-seq and digital gene expression  were performed using illumina technology. illumina sequencing provided comprehensive information about gene expression at the transcriptional level that could facilitate our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of c. sinense floral development. such data for c. sinense could also be used as an important resource to investigate the flowering pathway and various other biological mechanisms in other orchid species.

RESULTS
illumina sequencing and sequence assembly
to obtain an overview of the c. sinense transcriptome, a cdna library was generated from an equal mixture of rna isolated from all organs, and pair end sequenced using the illumina hiseq™ <dig> platform. after cleaning and quality checks,  <dig> million 90-bp reads were assembled into  <dig> contigs with a mean length of 326 bp . using paired-end reads, these contigs were further assembled into  <dig> unigenes by trinity, including  <dig> clusters and  <dig> singletons, with a mean length of 612 bp. the size distribution of these contigs and unigenes are shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  the assembly produced a substantial number of large contigs:  <dig> contigs were > <dig>  bp in length and  <dig> contigs were >500 bp, although most contigs were between  <dig> and 300 bp in length .  <dig> unigenes were > <dig>  bp in length .

annotation of predicted proteins
after searching the reference sequences using blastx against nr, swissport, cog and kegg, we found a total of  <dig>  unigenes providing a significant blast result .

among the  <dig> unigenes, approximately  <dig> % could be annotated in cog based on sequence homologies. in the cog classification,  <dig> unigenes were classified into  <dig> function classifications . ‘general function prediction’ was dominant. ‘translation’, ‘replication, recombination and repair’ and ‘posttranslational’ also shared a high-percentage of genes among the categories, and only a few genes matched the terms ‘nuclear structure’ and ‘extracellular structures’.  <dig> unigenes were annotated as the ‘signal transduction mechanisms’ category, which suggests that our study may allow for the identification of novel genes involved in signal transduction pathways. the cog analysis showed that the identified genes are involved in various biological processes.

go classification for unigenes
we used go assignments to classify the functions of the predicted c. sinense unigenes.  <dig> annotated unigenes were further categorized into  <dig> functional groups . metabolic and cellular processes were the most highly represented groups in the biological process category.  <dig> unigenes were annotated as the ‘metabolic process’ category, which suggests that our study may allow for the identification of novel genes involved in secondary metabolite synthesis pathways. cell and cell parts were dominant groups in the “cellular component function” category. in the “molecular function” category, a high percentage of genes came from the ‘binding’  and ‘catalytic activity’  groups. in the ‘nitrogen utilization’, ‘virion’ and ‘translation regulator activity’ groups, only a single unigene was annotated for each .

metabolic pathway assignment by kegg
in our study,  <dig> annotated sequences were mapped to the reference canonical pathways in kegg. in total,  <dig> sequences were assigned to  <dig> kegg pathways . the pathways with most representation by the unigenes were metabolic pathways  and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites . these pathways provide a valuable resource for investigating specific processes, functions and pathways during c. sinense research. interestingly,  <dig> unigenes involved in plant hormone signal transduction were found, which contained  <dig> pathways  controlling the signal transduction of several plant growth regulators, for example, auxin, cytokinin, gibberellin, abscisic acid, ethylene, brassinosteroid, jasmonic acid and salicylic acid. these hormones regulate seed dormancy, plant vegetative and reproductive growth, fruit ripening senescence and stress response.

the circadian clock is an important factor controlling plant physiology, and is also an important part of the photoperiod pathway. it regulates physiological activities by controlling the circadian rhythm  <cit> . a circadian rhythm was found in the kegg pathway involving  <dig>  unigenes. the detailed metabolic pathway for the circadian rhythm is shown in figure  <dig>  every gene in the pathway was associated with several unigenes. the pathway will be useful for further studies on the effect of the photoperiod pathway on c. sinense flowering-related processes.

identifying c. sinense flowering time-associated genes and mads-box genes
according to the annotation of unigenes, we obtained  <dig> genes associated with flowering time. some genes are shown in table  <dig>  these include photoperiod pathway genes such as gigantea , early flowering  <dig> , phytochrome interacting factor  <dig> , late elongated hypocotyl , chalcone synthase , circadian clock associated  <dig> , and co; vernalization pathway genes related to vernalization ; floral integrator pathway genes related to cauloflower , ap <dig>  ft, soc <dig> and terminal flower 1; and floral meristem identity genes lfy and ap <dig> were all identified in our c. sinense transcriptome database. additionally,  <dig> mads-box unigenes were also discovered . all these unigenes are important resources for the study of floral development and flower organ formation in the future.

identifying c. sinense constans-like gene family
co plays a central regulatory role in the photoperiod pathway, and is regulated by the circadian clock and light  <cit> . to determine the col gene family of c. sinense, we analyzed the transcriptome database generated by this study and found  <dig> unigenes annotated as zinc finger protein constans. as shown in additional file  <dig>  they showed homology with  <dig> arabidopsis col genes.

we selected seven unigenes which have two conserved b-box domains and a cct domain to further examine their relationship with other col genes from arabidopsis, rice, phalaenopsis and c. sinense. the seven unigenes are shown in table  <dig>  their amino acid sequences were used to construct a phylogenetic tree using mega <dig>  <cit>  to determine genetic distances. the phylogenetic tree was showed that all members could be divided into three divergent groups . unigene <dig> and cl <dig> contig <dig> were clustered with csco, phalcol as well as oshd <dig> in group i. they are closely related to arabidopsis atco/atcol1/atcol <dig>  cl <dig> contig <dig>  unigene <dig>  cl <dig> contig <dig> and cl <dig> contig <dig> were clustered in group ii. cl <dig> contig <dig> and cl <dig> contig <dig> are closely related to atcol9/atcol <dig>  unigene <dig> is closely related to atcol <dig>  and cl <dig> contig <dig> is closely related to atcol14/atcol <dig>  unigene <dig> was assigned to group iii and is closely related to atcol6/atcol <dig>  these results are consistent with the data shown in table  <dig> 

dge library sequencing and evaluation
the materials from vp, fdp, and rp were chosen to construct three dge libraries, then which were sequenced. three dge sequencing quality evaluation and alignment statistics were shown in table  <dig>  the percent of all low quality reads including only adaptor and containing n reads was less than  <dig> % in three libraries.  <dig> % of raw tags in each library were clean tags. after filtering the low quality tags, the total number of clean tags in each library was  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  million, respectively. among the clean tags, the number of sequences that could be mapped to transcriptome sequences amounted to  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  million, corresponding to  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> % in the three libraries, respectively.

variation in gene expression among three developmental stages
to identify the differentially expressed genes during three developmental stages, the number of clean tags for each gene was calculated, and the genes that were differentially expressed between the two samples were identified according to the method described by audic and claverie  <cit> .

the variations in gene expression were analyzed by comparing vp and fdp, vp and rp, and fdp and rp. the comparison between vp and fdp revealed significant variations in expression. a total of  <dig> genes, including  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes, were identified in fdp compared to vp .  <dig> genes showed specific expression in fdp and  <dig> genes showed specific expression in vp. these specific expression genes were listed in additional file  <dig> 

based on the go functional classification, most of the differential expression gene sets demonstrated down-regulated expression in the fdp library, and these genes were mainly correlated to membrane, vesicle and cellular component organization . in the kegg classification,  <dig> gene sets were significantly enriched, and most of these genes were mainly down-regulated in the fdp library and correlated to plant hormone signal transduction .

meanwhile, we compared the variations in gene expression between vp and rp. a total of  <dig> genes, including  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes, were identified in rp compared to vp .  <dig> genes showed specific expression in rp and  <dig> genes showed specific expression in vp. those genes that showed specific expression were listed in additional file  <dig> 

based on the go functional classification, most of the gene sets demonstrated up-regulated expression in the rp library, and these genes were mainly correlated to hydrolase activity, binding and organelle parts . in the kegg classification,  <dig> gene sets were significantly enriched, and most of these genes were mainly up-regulated in the fdp library and correlated to the spliceosome and ribosome .

a comparison between fdp and rp revealed more variations in gene expression. the results revealed  <dig> genes with significant differential expression levels between fdp and rp. among them,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively .  <dig> genes showed specific expression in rp and  <dig> genes showed specific expression in fdp. those genes that showed specific expression are listed in additional file  <dig> 

based on the go functional classification, most of the gene sets demonstrated up-regulated expression in the rp library, and these genes were mainly correlated to binding, membrane-bounded organelles and organelle parts . in the kegg classification,  <dig> gene sets were significantly enriched, and most of these genes were mainly up-regulated in the rp library and correlated to the spliceosome and rna transport .

we also focused on the genes related to flower development and chose some genes that showed significantly different expression among three developmental phases . the functional annotation for these unigenes was listed in additional file  <dig>  for example, unigene <dig> demonstrated higher expression levels in fdp and rp than in vp, unigene <dig> showed higher expression levels in rp than in vp and fdp, and unigene <dig> showed higher expression levels in vp and rp than in fdp, which were all homologous with arabidopsis thaliana auxin response factor  <dig>  and related to auxin metabolism. other significant expression of different genes among the three developmental phases might be associated with circadian rhythm , the vernalization pathway  and vernalization insensitive  <dig> , respectively and so on. to validate dge-tag profiling,  <dig> genes were selected randomly to examine the expression using rt-qpcr . the results were exhibited differential expression among three libraries and were identical to those obtained by dge expression profiling. thus, the data generated in this study is sufficient to be used as a tool to investigate some specific flowering genes which show comparative expression levels among different developmental phases.

discussion
illumina sequencing and sequence annotation
c. sinense is a very popular and traditional orchid in china. however, little is known about the mechanisms responsible for floral development and genomic information for c. sinense is currently unavailable. the aims of this project were to generate a large amount of cdna sequence data that would facilitate more detailed studies in c. sinense, and to identify the genes controlling flowering time. the availability of transcriptome data for c. sinense will meet the initial information needs for functional studies of this species and its relatives. in this study, a combination of rna-seq and three dge analyses were performed using illumina sequencing, which generated  <dig> , <dig> high quality reads that were assembled into  <dig> unigenes with an average sequence length of  <dig> base pairs. these unigenes were used for blastx and annotation against protein databases like nr, swissport, cog, kegg and go. in total,  <dig> sequences were identified through blast searches and  <dig> % unigenes had no homologues in the ncbi database. this may indicate that c. sinense vegetative and reproductive growth contains many unique processes and pathways.

identifying c. sinense flowering time-associated genes
the photoperiod and vernalization pathways are two important genetic networks of flowering control  <cit> . in our study, the sequences associated with both pathways could be identified . the photoperiod pathway comprises three parts: photoreceptors, a circadian clock and an output pathway from the clock specific to flowering  <cit> . light signals are first received by two photoreceptors, phytochromes  and cryptochromes   <cit> , which process the physical signals and produce a circadian clock  <cit> . the circadian clock provides a seasonal signal that adjusts plant development and regulates flowering time. it is controlled by a group of gene complexes that are composed of toc <dig>  cca <dig> and lhy and regulate transcriptional–translational negative feedback loops  <cit> . elf <dig> affects light input to the oscillator  <cit> . the processed signal is transmitted to the gi gene and the resultant signal activates the co gene  <cit> . gi is another clock-associated protein known to regulate circadian oscillation and flowering time of arabidopsis <cit> . the gi mutants are defective for the expression of cca <dig> and lhy genes. the circadian clock controls the expression rhythm of co through gi <cit> . co is a transcription factor that promotes flowering by inducing the expression of the direct downstream genes ft <cit>  and soc <dig> <cit> . col genes have been identified in some plant species, each of which seems to have a large family of these genes  <cit> . in arabidopsis, there are  <dig> col genes  <cit> . there are at least  <dig> col genes in the rice genome  <cit> . these col proteins contain two b-box domains at the n-terminus and a cct domain at the c-terminus  <cit> . in this study,  <dig> c. sinense col unigenes containing the conserved cct domain were identified . seven unigenes were used to perform the phylogenetic analysis. they were classified into three conserved col subgroups as defined previously  <cit> . col proteins belonging to different subgroups are expected to perform distinct biological roles, but only several col genes controlling flowering time have been studied in detail  <cit> . we presume that seven unigenes in c. sinense are expected to perform distinct biological roles. sequence homologues for other genes involved in regulation of the circadian clock described above  could be found in our database . furthermore, detailed metabolic pathways for the circadian rhythm and  <dig> related unigenes, such as phytochromes  and cryptochromes  were found . thus, these photoperiod pathways may be concerned with the regulation of flowering time in c. sinense.

vrn <dig> is a key gene involved in the vernalization pathway  <cit> . it promotes flowering by repressing the expression of flowering locus c  <cit> . vrn <dig> codes for a protein with homology to pcg proteins  <cit> . thus, vrn <dig> may function to keep the flc-chromatin state for down-regulation. sequence homologs for vrn <dig> could be found in our database . furthermore, temperature obviously affects the flowering time of c. sinense. we speculate that the vernalization pathway is related to the regulation of flowering time in c. sinense.

identifying c. sinense flowering integration genes and floral meristem identity genes
flowering integration genes accept the signal from the genetic pathway, and then induce floral meristem identity  genes for flowering as a whole  <cit> . at present, three integration genes, including soc1/agl <dig>  ft and tfl, have been identified. soc <dig> and ft are the direct target genes for co. the expression of ft and soc <dig> is controlled positively not only by the light pathway, but also by the autonomous pathway acting negatively through flc <cit> . the vernalization signal increases soc <dig> expression, presumably by reducing flc levels, and soc <dig> can also be up-regulated by a gibberellin pathway. accordingly, soc <dig> and ft act as the convergence of all four pathways  <cit> . tfl <dig> codes for a protein with homology to ft <cit> . the mutations in tfl <dig> are semidominant and early flowering with a determinate inflorescence  <cit> . thus, tfl <dig> codes for a repressor of flowering. tfl <dig> functions as a negative repressor of ft expression. sequence homologs for the floral integrator pathway genes related to ft, soc <dig> and tfl were all identified in our c. sinense transcriptome database .

the floral meristem is initiated by a set of fmi genes that include lfy, ap <dig>  cal, ap <dig>  and unusual floral organs  <cit> . among them, lfy and ap <dig> play a central role in flower meristem identity  <cit> . lfy regulates inflorescence shape and controls flowering time  <cit> . ap <dig> is the downriver target gene of lfy. lfy induces expression of ap <dig>  lfy protein, combined with the ap <dig> promoter activates the transcription of ap <dig> <cit> . the phenotype of the loss-of-function-type mutations in lfy or ap <dig> gene is as follows: flowers either have vegetative characteristics or have been replaced by vegetative shoots  <cit> . the phenotype of double mutations in lfy/ap <dig> is a scarce floral structure  <cit> , which elucidated the functional redundancies in ap1-lfy. functional redundancies were detected in ap1-cal, ap2-ap <dig> and ap2-lfy genes  <cit> . ap <dig> and cal belong to the mads domain genes and ufo codes for an f-box protein which degrades other proteins through a ubiquitation pathway  <cit> . lfy is also thought to promote cal and ufo expression  <cit> . therefore, these fmi genes cooperate together to promote the transition from vegetative growth to reproductive growth. sequence homologs for fmi genes cal, ap <dig>  lfy and ap <dig> were all identified in our c. sinense transcriptome database. these information of flowering integration genes and fmi genes would facilitate more detailed studies on the mechanism of floral differentiation for c. sinense.

differential expression of genes among three developmental phases
we have identified the putative homologs of col and other key genes involved in controlling flowering time in c. sinense. more studies on their expression patterns and on their interactive relationships in the future could be used to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that regulate the floral transition and the flowering genetic pathway in c. sinense. to better understand the information related to gene expression obtained for c. sinense, we created three deg libraries to analyze the gene expression patterns under three developmental phases. in the comparison between fdp with vp, most of the expressed genes were down-regulated and parts were up-regulated. in contrast, when rp was compared to vp and fdp, most of the expressed genes were up-regulated . furthermore, a large amount of genes which showed specific expression in the three phases were likely involved in floral development.

when fdp was compared to vp, tfl <dig> showed specific expression in vp. tfl <dig> codes for a flowering repressor that can function to control inflorescence architecture and extend the phases of shoot meristems in arabidopsis <cit> . our sequence was consistent with this theory. among all specific expression of annotated genes in rp compared to vp or fdp, auxin response factors  were identified in rp. auxin signaling is important in the regulation of developmental transitions such as seed germination, induction of flowering, leaf senescence and shedding of senescent organs. arfs are transcription factors that mediate responses to the plant hormone auxin  <cit> . for example, arf <dig> promotes the transition between multiple stages of arabidopsis development, including initiation of flowering, rosette leaf senescence, floral organ abscission and silique ripening. in contrast, arf <dig> is a transcriptional repressor and the arf <dig> mutation increases the transcription of aux/iaa genes in arabidopsis flowers  <cit> . moreover, most of the specific gene expression was not annotated as a relative function, which could assist in the search for some new genes associated with floral development.

although the molecular functions of c. sinense genes and the associated floral genetic pathways remain unknown, the present transcriptome analysis provides valuable information regarding c. sinense development, which could facilitate further investigations of the detailed floral development mechanisms of this culturally important orchid.

CONCLUSIONS
the combination of rna-seq and dge analysis based on illumina sequencing technology provided comprehensive information on gene expression. candidate genes on flowering time genes, mads-box genes and col genes were rapidly identified by this approach. this data could be used as a tool to investigate the flowering pathway and various other biological pathways in c. sinense.
