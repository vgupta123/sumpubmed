BACKGROUND
broad-leaved trees grown in temperate zones must avoid periods unfavorable for growth, such as harsh winter weather conditions, synchronizing their annual growth cycle with seasonality. hence, they have evolved mechanisms to switch between active growth during summer and dormancy during winter, in response to environmental signals.

in trees and woody perennial plants, photoperiod  typically induces growth cessation, the initiation of cold acclimation, the formation of a terminal bud  and bud dormancy  <cit> . timing and duration of bud set process are inherited as quantitative traits, involving large number of genes with small individual effects  <cit> . local adaptation of bud set phenology allows trees to find a compromise between the risk of frost damage and the maximization of the growing season duration  <cit> . in addition, bud activity determines the extent of the seasonal growth, tree architecture, wood quality and productivity  <cit> . common garden studies have shown that timing of bud set is strongly correlated with latitude of origin of the population  <cit> . trees from high latitudes are more sensitive to the photoperiod change than those from southern regions  <cit> . even if day length is widely accepted to be the primarily used environmental signal, the timing of bud formation is also influenced by other factors, such as temperature  <cit> , temperature × photoperiod  interaction  <cit> , nutrition and drought  <cit> . it has also been demonstrated that bud set in norway spruce  was strongly affected for many years by temperature during zygotic and somatic embryogenesis  <cit> , probably influenced by epigenetic memory  <cit> . this can be seen as a special form of phenotypic plasticity that opens the possibility of adaptation without genetic changes and, therefore, it is an important mechanism when adapting to climate changes  <cit> . given the influence of temperature on tree phenology, growth cessation may be affected by climatic warming, which will increase the risk of frost damage in spring, and affect the survival and eventually the spatial distribution of forest trees, because of a less well-suited adaptation to the local altered environment  <cit> . since range shift and changes in phenology are the best recorded shifts induced by climate change  <cit> , phenological observations are very important for a better understanding of how different plant species respond to regional climate change  <cit> . furthermore, research efforts are also required to investigate patterns of phenotypic plasticity, which can represent a crucial determinant of both short- and long-term plant responses  <cit> .

quantitative trait locus  mapping is a powerful approach to identify key genomic regions controlling adaptive traits  <cit> , especially for species where a reference genome is already available  <cit> . in the face of climate change, the main focus of qtl mapping studies in poplars has been on traits tightly linked to environmental adaptation, such as bud set and bud flush  <cit> . in populus nigra  the genes underlying these adaptive traits remain largely unknown, but genetic maps with hundreds of molecular markers are available  <cit> . these genetic maps, expanded with gene-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms , provide a foundation for the investigation of the genomic regions underlying adaptive traits.

therefore, the objectives of this study were  to assess phenotypic plasticity and evaluate the relative importance of genotype × environment  interaction in the phenotypic expression  of bud set in p. nigra through a multi-environment approach,  to identify genomic regions underlying the bud set process through qtl mapping and  to select a set of promising candidate genes  in highlighted genomic regions.

RESULTS
dynamics of bud set process in the two sites
the parent '58-861' was the earliest genotype to reach the onset of growth cessation  in viterbo , but it attained this stage beforehand in cavallermaggiore . in addition, transgressive segregation of some offspring over the earliest '58-861' parent was observed at both field sites . however, the parent 'poli' was the latest genotype to reach all stages of the bud set process. because 'poli' is not well-enough adapted to the climate conditions of the cv northern experimental site, it did not survive after re-sprouting. therefore, significant differences between the two parents for all the onset-of-stage traits could only be detected at vt. moreover, the two sites did not show clear differences in photoperiod regime during the period of bud set measurements . cumulative minimum temperature  between july and october demonstrated that cv was a colder site on average . however, when higher weights are given to minimum temperature < 10°c , the observed cumulative minimum temperature pattern provided additional description of a temporary but early fall of temperature at vt.

the average timing of date <dig>  at population level was similar at the two sites, i.e. day of the year   <dig> amounting to about  <dig> and  <dig> h of cumulative night length  in cv and vt, respectively, with only three minutes difference in terms of effective night length between the two sites . the same population mean was also found at both sites for date <dig> , i.e. doy  <dig> , for a total of  <dig>  d needed on average by the full-sib family studied  to cover the whole phenological process . actually, the high value of pearson correlations among the five phenological stages showed that, when the growth cessation process begins, all the onset-of-stage traits follow constantly through a cascade process . while the population mean of the most distant phenological stages was the same at both sites, a great variation at genotypic level could be observed. early bud set genotypes reached date <dig>  at doy  <dig>  in vt and at doy  <dig> in cv, with about four days differences between sites.

pop <dig> grown in two experimental sites in italy: cavallermaggiore  and viterbo . values are expressed as day of the year , cumulative night length  and cumulative minimum temperature < 10°c  for date <dig> , date <dig>  and the total process length at population level. the genotype means of date <dig>  for the earliest genotype and of date <dig>  for the latest one, expressed using all the parameters considered, are shown.

pop <dig> grown in two experimental sites in italy: cavallermaggiore  and viterbo . data were analyzed on cumulative night length  basis.  within site phenotypic  and genetic ) correlations for cv and  likewise for vt. the levels of significance of the pearson coefficient are indicated as: ns, non-significant; *, p ≤  <dig> ; **, p ≤  <dig> ; ***, p ≤  <dig> .

as for bud set subprocesses at the two sites, the duration of bud maturation  was longer than the duration of bud formation . consequently, subproc <dig> experienced longer cnl and higher cmt <dig> than subproc <dig> . moreover, subproc <dig> was negatively correlated with date <dig>  especially at the northern site  .

in vt, phenological patterns of the two parents did not show significant differences in subprocesses relating to cnl . with regards to cmt <dig>  differences were exhibited only in subproc <dig> . the parent '58-861' was one of the fastest genotypes to complete subproc <dig> in cv but, on the contrary, it was very slow to complete subproc <dig>  however, in vt, the two parents did not show extreme values in the family distribution and scored similar subprocesses in terms of cnl . for the parent 'poli', subproc <dig> and subproc <dig> showed similar duration relating to cnl in vt , but it experienced cold temperature only in subproc <dig> . the parent '58-861' required more time to complete subproc <dig> and less time to complete subproc <dig> in vt than in cv . differences in subproc <dig> dependent on cmt <dig> were observed between the two sites . linear regressions between selected phenological characters, according to principal component analysis , and biometric traits demonstrated that in our experiments growth characters did not influence the phenotypic variation of bud set .

broad-sense heritability of bud set traits
substantial within-site genetic variation for all traits is presented in additional file 3: table s <dig> and additional file 4: table s <dig>  in general, data showed higher levels of phenotypic variance and lower broad-sense heritability  for duration traits as compared to onset-of-stage traits . phenological bud set traits expressed as cnl showed a decreasing trend in terms of genetic component of variance from date <dig>  to date <dig>  at both sites, with broad-sense heritability at genotypic level  ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  in cv, and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  in vt . the transition from shoot to bud structure  showed quite similar hgen <dig> values between the two sites . duration traits and subprocesses, analysed using the cnl parameter, showed low levels of h <dig> especially at individual level  in vt  .

data were obtained from a populus nigra full-sib family  grown in two sites in italy: cavallermaggiore  and viterbo . data were analyzed on cumulative night length  basis. relative importance of environment , genotype , genotype by environment  and residual  effects on the phenotypic variation  are presented together with values of broad-sense heritability at genotypic level . spearman rank coefficients  were calculated from genotype means in cv and vt. the significance level of differences between the two parents for each trait is indicated as: ns, non-significant; *, p ≤  <dig> ; **, p ≤  <dig> ; ***, p ≤  <dig> .

we observed a positive genetic correlation among onset-of-stage traits. additionally, subproc <dig> was negatively correlated with date <dig>  . both these cases were also previously shown by linear correlations at the two sites .

g × e interaction and phenotypic plasticity
genotype × environment  interaction was calculated using a two-way analysis of variance with environment  and genotype as variation factors. the sources of phenotypic variation  were statistically significant with no environment effect in date <dig> . likewise, there was no g × e interaction effect on duration <dig>  . the relative importance of the genotypic effect as well as the g × e component were considerable in all the onset-of-stage traits with a decreasing trend from date <dig>  to date <dig> . the phenotypic variation explained by the genotype component ranged from  <dig> %  to  <dig> %  and from  <dig> %  to  <dig> %  for the g × e interaction.

spearman rank coefficients were positive, moderate and highly significant for the onset-of-stage traits, but they decreased during time. hence, there were not significant changes in the ranking of genotypes between environments, but the degree of changes increased gradually during time . concerning duration traits, low levels of genotypic variance  and high levels of residuals  in the phenotypic variation were observed, with an increasing importance of the g × e interaction during bud development . the low values of spearman coefficients for duration traits were a clear indication of strong and random changes in genotype ranking between environments .

the interaction pattern of the population mean for date <dig>  expressed as doy, indicative of the critical day length inducing growth cessation, showed an almost horizontal trend for the three studied sites. parent '58-861' was a very plastic genotype showing an earlier onset of growth cessation in savigliano  and cv as compared to vt. the onset of growth cessation was initiated at different night lengths at the three sites, with a difference of about  <dig> min between sav and vt. cmt <dig> in sav, cv and vt  contributed to the delay of growth cessation of this genotype . conversely, 'poli' appeared to be less plastic for date <dig>  and its response seemed mainly influenced by the photoperiod. it reached date <dig>  at a similar effective night length, with a difference of  <dig> min between sav and vt, showing a minor sensitivity to increasing value of cmt <dig> .

the relative ecovalence analysis  showed only a few genotypes contributing to the overall g × e interaction. these genotypes were the most extreme genotypes in cv for date  <dig>  . seventeen of the most plastic genotypes contributed for 50% of the g × e interaction. thirteen of them demonstrated an interaction pattern describing a positive slope cv-vt in relation to cmt <dig>  the remaining four genotypes, which were the latest in cv, had a negative slope that was probably due to non controlled factors  . the duration of the bud set process of the thirteen plastic genotypes with early date <dig>  in cv was always shorter in vt than in cv. moreover, these genotypes always initiated date <dig>  later in vt than in cv, where cmt <dig> was reached earlier .

qtl analyses
discriminative bud set traits for qtl analysis were a list of complementary traits, which explain together a large part  of phenotypic variation observed for growth cessation and bud onset. the trait date <dig> , although highly correlated with date <dig> , was added because we consider it physiologically remarkable  and scarcely reported in literature. for these four traits eight and  <dig> qtl were mapped on the maternal and paternal map, respectively. genetic parameters for the detected qtl are shown in table  <dig>  the qtl intervals were located on  <dig> linkage groups : i, iii, iv, vi, vii, x, xi, xiii, xvi, xvii, xviii and xix . qtl for date <dig>  and date <dig>  co-localized on lg-iv, x, xvi, xvii, and on lg-ia together with subproc <dig>  on lg-vib, qtl intervals for subproc <dig>  subproc <dig> and date <dig>  overlapped . the average percentage of variance explained  by individual qtl was  <dig> %, and the maximum pve per trait was  <dig> % . three qtl, two for subproc <dig> and one for subproc <dig>  had effects with opposite directions between the two sites , thus reflecting the negative genetic correlation between these traits and the onset-of-stage traits . seven of the  <dig> qtl for the paternal map and one of the eight qtl for the maternal map had significant differences between the two sites .

parental
data were obtained from a populus nigra full-sib family  grown in two sites in italy: cavallermaggiore  and viterbo . selected traits related to bud set phenology  were considered. for each qtl, the parental map, the linkage groups , the logarithm of the odds , the 95% confidence interval  in cm, the genetic effect and the percentage of phenotypic variance explained  at cv and vt, are shown. p-values indicate significant site effect: *, p ≤  <dig> ; **, p ≤  <dig> ; ***, p ≤  <dig> . pve values ≥  <dig>  are underlined.

identification of cgs
anchored simple sequence repeat  markers have allowed linking  <dig> out of  <dig> identified qtl to the physical map. genomic intervals of qtl on lg-i, iv, x, xiii, xvi and xvii, corresponding to co-locating qtl with high pve, were analyzed. their intervals ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mbp, considering a unique overlapping region where qtl co-localized. the number of gene models in these intervals ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  the total number of gene models in all the intervals was  <dig> . the availability of the genome sequence of the parental genotype 'poli' and three other p. nigra genotypes  <cit> , allowed the calculation of the number of snps in each interval for 'poli' and among the four p. nigra genotypes .

qtl intervals were projected on the physical genome sequence by anchored markers . the length of the qtl intervals in centimorgan  and in kilobase pairs  is given together with the number of gene models, single nucleotide polymorphisms  for the male parent 'poli' and snps between 'poli' and three other p. nigra genotypes   <cit> . the table also reports the number of candidate genes  for bud development from ruttink et al.  <cit>  and other sources  on linkage groups  containing qtl and within the qtl interval.

qtl analyses cannot identify specific genes responsible for the phenotypic variation, but the integration of genomic data with the knowledge of gene function or expression allowed identifying promising cgs linked to bud set. literature searches about phenology, coupled with the search of genbank database, allowed finding a total of  <dig> genes reported to be involved in bud set. among them,  <dig> sequences were located on the p. trichocarpa genome assembly v <dig> ,  <dig> were identified by ruttink et al.  <cit> , and  <dig> from other sources . sixty seven expressional cgs from ruttink et al.  <cit>  and six from the other sources were within the seven qtl regions analyzed, corresponding to  <dig> % of all genes contained in these intervals . the latter set of six cgs were: one photoreception factor gene, phytochrome a ; three transcription factor genes for signal transduction, constans2-like , far-red elongated hypocotyl  <dig> protein , and phya signal transduction factor ; two circadian clock factor genes, circadian clock coupling factor . since these six candidates did not come from expressional evidence, a search in the available expressed sequence tag  database  was conducted in order to find evidence of expression. all the six gene sequences showed significant hits vs. ests belonging to a mixed tissue preparation of populus leaf, bud and stem, which could be referred to as phenology-related tissues. in the p. nigra mapping population, a single marker t-test  between phenotypic data of subproc <dig> and snp polymorphism used to map phya indicated that this snp was not responsible for the effect of subproc <dig> qtl . furthermore, gene models were investigated closest to the logarithm of the odds  peak of selected qtl, considering ±  <dig> kbp from the lod peak position  <cit> . when no gene was found, the region was extended to ±  <dig> kbp to find at least one gene per lod peak. eighteen gene models corresponding to these search criteria were found and listed in additional file 6: table s <dig>  some of these genes were functionally involved in regulation of transcription , intracellular signal transduction , photomorphogenesis  and uv light sensitivity . the latter gene is also present in the list of expressional cgs found by ruttink et al.  <cit> . other genes close to lod peaks were related to developmental process , response to stress and/or hormones  and others encoded structural constituent of ribosome . the est database search revealed that  <dig> out of  <dig> gene models are putatively expressed. among them,  <dig> models showed significant hits matching to est libraries belonging to tissues related to phenology .

given the data collected in terms of qtl co-localization, expression and literature reports, we came up with a set of most promising cgs for bud set traits composed of six functional candidates,  <dig> gene models and  <dig> expressional candidates.

discussion
unravelling bud set process and g × e interaction
populus is an ideal model tree to study bud set because of its indeterminate shoot growth. another factor worthy of consideration is that pop <dig> parental genotypes originated from contrasting environments. these two advantages render powerful the exploration of the g × e interaction patterns and phenotypic plasticity that are mostly uncharacterized for phenology traits. recently, a new bud set scoring system in populus spp. has led to the dissection of the bud set process into different stages and durations to estimate their relative contribution to the accomplishment of this phenological process  <cit> . based on this new tool, the phenotypic plasticity and the g × e interaction was fully investigated in a p. nigra f <dig> full-sib family using a multi-environment approach. the transition from shoot to bud structure  was selected as the very critical determinant of bud set at both sites by pca analysis. the selection of phenotypic descriptors characterizing key steps of bud set process allows to improve the estimation of genetic variation expressed at these different steps and the detection of more robust genomic regions involved in the phenological process. high phenotypic and genetic correlations between stage traits, consistent to those observed in p. nigra natural population  <cit> , pointed out bud set as a cascade process, during which one phase could be indicative of the whole process. genetic correlations between the two subprocesses vary in magnitude and sign from one environment to another. indeed, in the past it was recognized that genetic correlations change across environments  <cit> .

in the present study, the timing of stages and duration traits showed different levels of h <dig>  this contrast could be explained simultaneously by different levels of expressed genetic variation and different levels of residual variation. stage traits were characterized by a significant genotypic effect and a high heritability value, but the influence of the residual factors, either environmental conditions or precision of measure, augmented from date <dig>  to date <dig> . the increase of the importance of environmental factor from date <dig>  to date <dig>  is contrary to the one observed by rohde et al.  <cit>  in hybrid poplars, but similar to the one observed in p. nigra natural populations studied in the same paper. a major genetic control of the last part of the process  was also found in a f <dig> hybrid poplar pedigree by howe et al.  <cit> . similar results were also found by li et al.  <cit>  in interspecific poplar hybrids in two successive years. this major h <dig> may be explained by the use of interspecific hybrids that could increase the genetic variance and heritability estimation for these traits  <cit> . nevertheless, heritability estimates have often been shown to be specific to the population and environment  <cit> .

the total duration of the bud set process for pop <dig> was conserved at the two sites, but the time spent in each subprocess depended on the site. however, in both cases subproc <dig> was longer than subproc <dig>  interestingly, as exhibited by phenotypic correlations we observed that the later genotypes for date <dig>  hastened subproc <dig>  which could be an important strategy to avoid frost injury.

according to the concept of critical night length, where photoperiod is responsible for the onset of bud set process across environments and years  <cit> , pop <dig> family reached date <dig>  at about the same effective night length at both sites. importantly, anova analysis for date <dig>  showed a non-significant contribution of the environment effect and, on the opposite, a significant g × e effect . this indicates that genotypes react differently to different environments. data showed always a highly significant contribution of the g × e interaction in the phenotypic variation of all the stages, with a decreasing trend observed during the process. rohde et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that different locations differentially influenced the timing of growth cessation and the duration of bud formation in identical poplar genotypes, suggesting that high temperatures render the meristem less sensitive to growth-arresting photoperiodic signals. moreover, kalcsits et al.  <cit>  showed that night temperature has a greater influence than day temperature in poplar. in the present study, the growth cessation of the plastic genotypes started earlier at the site with the lower minimum overnight temperature. total duration of the bud set process for plastic genotypes was hastened in vt where lower temperatures were experienced during bud set. the site vt was globally warmer than cv with higher temperatures prevailing during the time until growth cessation, but the fall of temperatures recorded in vt during a limited number of nights was like a short treatment in an usually warmer site. few recent studies showed that temperature can modify the timing of photoperiod controlling phenological events in deciduous woody plants  <cit> . the relative contribution of the g × e interaction on the phenotypic variation observed on date <dig> was perfectly comparable with the results of luquez et al.  <cit>  in p. tremula in two sites. in our p. nigra family the magnitude of g × e interaction partially increased from subproc <dig> to subproc <dig>  the latter is a developmental period for which the genotypes of the analyzed family tended to respond differently to the various environments.

distribution of genotype relative ecovalences showed that only few genotypes strongly contributed to the overall g × e interaction for date <dig> . more than important rank changes, these genotypes revealed differences in the scale of response to environmental changes. this is the case for '58-861', one of the earliest genotype for the onset of growth cessation  at both sites but sensitive to cold temperatures. this could be an important survival strategy for trees to adjust their short-term response to temperature in a changing climate. increasing rank change effect responsible for the g × e interaction was observed during the bud set process. non-significant spearman coefficients indicated random changes in genotype ranking for duration traits. consequently, a major influence of environmental conditions on the variation of these traits was observed.

genomic regions containing qtl for bud set
the qtl detected in this study explain a small proportion of the phenotypic variance , which is likely overestimated due to the relatively small progeny size  <cit> . however, several studies on global gene expression demonstrated the complex gene networks involved in bud formation, with large sets of genes temporally regulated during each phase of the process  <cit> . therefore, one can expect a complex genetic control of bud formation by many genes with minor effect on the phenotype. similar results were also described by jermstad et al.  <cit>  for spring bud flush in douglas-fir. in forest trees, biological and technical constraints make difficult to manage wide progeny sizes, thus limiting the complete genome coverage with high resolution genetic maps. this negatively affects the detection of qtl with major effect, if present within uncovered genome regions, and reduces possibility to detect qtl with minor effect. the number of qtl identified also depends on the importance of genetic factors for the trait. this is in agreement with our observations, with more qtl identified for the onset-of-stage traits that showed medium to high h <dig> than for the duration traits.

the co-localization of most qtl for stages and subproc <dig> was in agreement with their high genetic correlation, relating to the physiological relationship between these traits. this could be due to the pleiotropic effect of a single gene affecting the traits or the physical linkage and/or linkage disequilibrium between two loci influencing the traits  <cit> . negative genetic correlations indicate antagonistic effects of the loci on the traits. when stages qtl co-localized with the subproc <dig> qtl, they had opposite genetic effect.

seven qtl on 'poli' map and one on '58-861' map have significantly different effects between the two environments, underlying the significant g × e interaction. phenotypic data indicated that genotype '58-861' was highly plastic, while 'poli' encountered difficulties in adapting to the cv site. this suggests that the expression of alleles inherited from the 'poli' parent is more dependent on the environment than the expression of alleles inherited from '58-861' parent.

regardless of the slight changes in the genetic maps and the addition of a second site , the qtl with high pve were identified as in rohde et al.  <cit> , who analyzed the same mapping family but with less individuals. when the framework map was compared to that described by gaudet et al.  <cit>  and then used by rohde et al.  <cit> , the addition of new f <dig> individuals has led to the mapping of new framework markers and to the splitting of some lgs. however, qtl were detected on lg-iii, lg-vi and lg-xiii, which belong to the six robust regions selected by rohde et al.  <cit> . previously, qtl for bud set were identified in another pedigree of p. trichocarpa × p. deltoides on lg-iii, vi and x  <cit> . these three lgs have also been detected in rohde et al.  <cit>  and in the current study. the genes phyb <dig>  lhy <dig> and lhy <dig>  of which snp polymorphism explain part of the phenotypic variation of bud set in p. tremula  <cit> , were not within the common qtl intervals across several populus mapping pedigrees  <cit> . qtl regions recurrently identified in different pedigrees and environments are most likely robust genomic regions controlling the variation of the traits.

identifying positional candidate genes
qtl mapping is an early step in identifying genes underlying trait variation  <cit> . the availability of the p. trichocarpa genome sequence adds a new dimension to qtl mapping, allowing to investigate genes within qtl intervals and map cgs in silico. deep analysis of the most robust qtl regions allowed to highlight  <dig> gene models,  <dig> bud set-related expressional cgs and six functional cgs .

the functional cgs are involved in light signaling pathway. in particular, co-l <dig>  that belongs to the constans gene family, was found to be regulated by photoperiod and involved in growth cessation in norway spruce  <cit>  and populus  <cit> . pat <dig>  fhy <dig> , zgt1like and zgt2like are also involved in the regulation of phya signaling  <cit> , which could affect the quantitative variation of bud set. this regulation mechanism could explain why phya was not directly responsible for the phenotypic variation of this trait , even if it is well known to play a key role in growth cessation  <cit> .

another interesting cg is the uv-b light insensitive  <dig> , which is close to a peak of qtl lod and also belongs to the expressional cgs found by ruttink et al.  <cit> . uvi <dig> is responsive to uv-b light and its expression level decreased with the cessation of cell division in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . in populus, uvi <dig> gene was also found to be down-regulated during bud formation and cambial dormancy  <cit> .

among the hundred gene models annotated within our large qtl intervals, we investigated those close to peaks of lod. the identified cgs that are then supported by in silico evidences of expression in phenology-related tissues, mainly respond to light and cold as the functional cgs within qtl intervals. therefore, they could participate to environmental adaptation by the plasticity of their expression, which is in agreement with the phenotypic data.

CONCLUSIONS
the present work improves our understanding of the complex genetic architecture of bud set in poplar and of the considerable effect of g × e interaction in this process. qtl for bud set were identified and the projection of the most robust qtl on the p. trichocarpa genome, associated to previous gene expression studies, allowed the identification of cgs underlying the qtl. furthermore, by investigating the physiological dynamics of bud set, we were able to confirm that the onset of growth cessation was triggered by night length, and the effect of environmental factors increased during the process. additionally, a low number of plastic genotypes was responsible for the observed g × e interaction, with some of them being sensitive to temperature for the onset of growth cessation.

the recent development of the draft genome sequencing projects of p. nigra , as well as the whole-genome snp annotation, and the high throughput snp genotyping platform  will be valuable tools allowing the scanning of allelic variation in cgs and analysis of natural populations by association mapping to determine the alleles associated with bud set traits. while some progress has been made in mapping bud set qtl, the elucidation of the underlying molecular mechanisms remains a bottleneck. therefore, using expression qtl  analysis will help to identify genes and gene networks associated to bud phenology and underlying traits involved in growth. this study opens up stimulating perspectives for molecular breeding aimed at increasing forest adaptation and productivity in a rapidly changing environment.
