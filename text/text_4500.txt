BACKGROUND
c-myb was originally identified as the chicken cell homologue of the v-myb oncogenes found in two strains of avian leukosis virus  <cit> . these avian v-myb oncogenes induce myeloid and erythroid forms of leukaemia in chickens and the activation of the c-myb promoter by the insertion of avian and murine retroviruses has also been implicated in diverse forms of leukaemia  <cit> . a role for myb in human leukaemogenesis was initially suspected following the demonstration of myb overproduction in cells from patients with leukaemia. this role has recently been confirmed by the detection of duplications and translocations affecting the c-myb locus, particularly in acute and chronic myeloid leukaemia and in acute t-cell lymphoblastic leukaemia  <cit> . myb deregulation is also associated with colorectal cancers  <cit> , carcinomas  <cit>  and breast cancers expressing oestrogen receptor-alpha  <cit> , in which myb has been implicated in prolactin-induced signalling pathways  <cit> .

in normal cells, myb has been shown to be essential for haematopoietic lineage specification, t- and b-lymphocyte differentiation, colonic mucosal crypt regeneration and brain neurogenesis, on the basis of the abnormal phenotypes observed in mouse myb mutants  <cit> . in zebrafish, myb has also been shown to be essential for haematopoiesis  <cit>  and the silencing of c-myb in zebrafish embryos also leads to abnormal phenotypes, with effects on eye tissue formation in particular  <cit> .

c-myb is the founding member of a family of genes encoding transcription factors with a dna-binding domain consisting of three regions: r <dig>  r <dig> and r <dig>  <cit> . vertebrate genomes contain two other closely related genes from this family  <cit> : mybl <dig> , which is expressed in a restricted panel of tissues, and mybl <dig> , which is ubiquitously expressed. the products of these genes regulate the expression of genes involved in the control of cell proliferation and differentiation  <cit> . in plants, the r2r <dig> mybs constitute a large family of transcription factors involved in the regulation of plant-specific developmental and physiological processes  <cit> .

myb generally acts as a transcriptional activator, binding to the myb binding site on dna  <cit>  and recruiting the cbp/p <dig> coactivator proteins  <cit> , thereby increasing the level of transcription of myb targets. the oncogenic properties of myb result from the overexpression or inappropiate activation of c-myb  <cit> .

the level of c-myb expression is critical and is regulated by a number of mechanisms. at the transcriptional level, the c-myb promoter may be transactivated by a large number of proteins, including myb itself, and attenuation sequences identified in the first intron of myb also regulate myb elongation  <cit> . no particular pattern of cell specificity has been clearly demonstrated for transcriptional regulation processes, whereas tight control over the levels of mature myb mrna is restricted to tissue compartments with a high turnover. myb mrna and myb protein have a very short half-life  <cit> . they are present in large amounts in haematopoietic progenitor cells but are absent from terminally differentiated cells, suggesting that rapid changes occur  <cit> . an absolute requirement for the fine-tuning of c-myb expression was recently highlighted by the demonstration of a compromising effect of decreases in c-myb gene activity on murine haematopoietic stem cells, leading to a myeloproliferative disorder involving stem cells with novel characteristics  <cit> .

the post-transcriptional mechanisms regulating myb levels involve micrornas . mirnas constitute a class of highly conserved small  non-coding rnas found in plants and animals  <cit> . in animals, mature mirnas generated by processing from the stem loop pre-mirna are incorporated into the silencing complex , which mediates post-transcriptional repression by binding to mrna molecules, causing a decrease in the rate of translation or stability of the target mrna  <cit> . metazoan mirna target recognition is based on watson-crick pairing of the 5' region of the mirna, mostly via nucleotides  <dig> to  <dig> -- known as the mirna seed -- to sites generally located within the 3'-untranslated region  of the target mrna. several hundreds of mirnas with highly conserved sequences have been identified in diverse vertebrate species, from fish to humans  <cit> . moreover, the lengths and sequences of the 3' utrs from mammals and birds are sufficiently similar for alignments to be generated  <cit> . prediction algorithms  based on base-pairing between the mirna seed and mrna sequences have identified potential mirna target sites in thousands of human genes  <cit> . a comparative analysis of several mammalian genomes suggested that mirna target sites were conserved regulatory motifs in mammals  <cit> . a pioneering comparative analysis of mammalian and fish mirna targets yielded  <dig> orthologous mirna target genes conserved between these two groups  <cit> .

it has been predicted that mirnas may regulate the production of proteins from as many as 10% to 30% of the genes present in the human genome  <cit> . there is evidence to suggest that mirna function is critical for normal cellular development and homeostasis. the production of mir- <dig> in mature b and t cells has been shown to block early b-cell development, and its ectopic production in haematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells has been shown to result in significantly lower than normal numbers of mature b cells  <cit> . moreover, mir- <dig> controls b-cell differentiation by targeting murine myb in a dose-dependent manner  <cit> . by targeting myb, mir- <dig> also drives the differentiation of murine megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitors into megakaryocytes, indicating a key role for mir- <dig> in controlling lineage commitment  <cit> . thrombopoietin also induces megakaryopoiesis by downregulating myb expression through the effects of mir- <dig>  <cit> . overall, in haematopoietic lineages and the b-cell subsets of tonsil tissues, mir- <dig> and myb display opposite patterns of expression  <cit> . opposite patterns of mir- <dig> and myb expression are also observed in immortalised cell lines, in which no mir- <dig> is detected  <cit> .

like most vertebrate mrnas  <cit> , myb mrnas are conserved targets of micrornas. functional mir- <dig> target sites have been validated in human, murine and zebrafish myb 3'utrs  <cit>  and orthologous functional target sites of mir- <dig> have been identified in mammals, but are not conserved in zebrafish.

we sought to increase knowledge about mir-150/myb interactions during the course of evolution, by investigating the function of avian mir- <dig>  several attempts at extensive or deep sequencing  <cit>  have generated a list of more than a hundred chicken mirnas in mirbase, but only a few chicken targets have been validated  <cit> . the chicken, an amniote that has evolved separately from mammals for about  <dig> million years, has provided unique data on vertebrate evolution  <cit> . the evolutionary distance between chicken and mammals may eventually facilitate studies of the target site adaptation of mammalian mirnas. we used a reporter assay to identify the functional targets of mir- <dig> in the avian myb 3'utr and performed a comparative in silico analysis of predicted and experimentally validated functional target sequences in the vertebrate myb 3'utr . our findings show that the number of putative mir- <dig> target sites has increased during evolution, with chicken and mammals displaying an additional set of target sites, but with only one of the sites in chicken being functional, that identical to the functional site in zebrafish. the avian mir- <dig> bound to the same target sites in chicken cells and in the human cell line used to identify mammalian mir- <dig> target sites, demonstrating the specificity of this pattern of binding to the avian myb 3'utr.

RESULTS
cloning of mature avian gga-mir-150
we cloned avian mature mirna-150-5p  from small-rna libraries derived from spleen or peripheral blood leukocytes before and at advanced stages of marek's disease virus -induced lymphomagenesis in chickens . by contrast, gga-mir- <dig> was not detected in libraries derived from chicken immortalised lymphoid cell lines  <cit> ; . the expression pattern of the avian gga-mir- <dig> is similar to that of the human hsa-mir- <dig>  which is expressed in normal human haematopoietic cell lineages but not in immortalised cell lines  <cit> . the sequences of mirnas seem to have been conserved during evolution, because the mature gga-mir- <dig> cloned from our libraries and the recently released sequence  <cit> http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=gpl <dig> contain the seed region  sequence  identified in the other twelve mir- <dig> sequences listed in mirbase  <cit> http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk . all mature mir- <dig> sequences begin with a uracil  residue and only four positions have been found to harbour changes . the mature gga-mir- <dig> sequence differed from its human and murine counterparts by one residue, and from the zebrafish sequence by two residues .

chicken gga-mir- <dig> targets avian myb
we investigated the targeting of avian myb by gga-mir- <dig> in luciferase reporter assays on cell cultures. the sequence of the precursor pri-mirna gga-mir- <dig> is not present in the released sequence of the gallus gallus genome  <cit> http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/guide/chicken/ and we were unable to identify pri-mirna gga-mir- <dig> on the basis of synteny with human and zebrafish. we therefore constructed a synthetic avian pre-mir- <dig>  based on a comparison of various mammalian pre-mir- <dig> sequences and stem loop structures . the synthetic avian pre-mir- <dig> amplicon obtained by pcr with appropriate primers  was introduced into a pcdna <dig> vector . we used a mir- <dig> mutant plasmid  as a control, with the deletion of one c residue within the mir seed sequence , to prevent pairing between gga-mir- <dig> and putative targets in the avian myb 3'utr. we assessed the functionality of gga-mir- <dig>  by establishing stable lymphoid chicken mdv cell lines ectopically producing gga-mir- <dig> or mutated gga-mir- <dig>  the chicken mdv cell lines msb- <dig>  <cit>  and pa <dig>  <cit>  were transfected with pmir- <dig>  pmir-150mut or pcdna vectors. mdv cells ectopically producing gga-mir- <dig>  or mutated gga-mir- <dig>  and control pcdna-transfected cells  were then isolated by selection on neomycin. northern blots showed the ectopic production of a mature gga-mir- <dig> of the same size by mdvt- <dig> cells and spleen cells, whereas a slightly smaller mature mutated gga-mir- <dig> was detected in mdvt-150mut cells . these findings are consistent with the deletion of one nucleotide from the mature mutated gga-mir- <dig>  confirming the successful transcription and maturation of synthetic avian pre-mir- <dig> from vectors with pol ii promoters  <cit> .

we investigated the targeting of avian myb by gga-mir- <dig>  by inserting the 3'utr fragment of the chicken myb cdna into a prl-tk vector downstream from the renilla luciferase reporter gene. the various mdvt cells were cotransfected with the myb wt prl-tk vector and the internal control pcdnamluc vector encoding firefly luciferase, by electroporation, and dual luciferase assays were performed. we normalised luciferase activity, taking the value for mdvt-150mut cells as 100%, as mutated gga-mir- <dig> did not repress activity in mdvt-150mut cells. the activity of the myb wt reporter was specifically repressed by gga-mir- <dig> in pa <dig> and msb-1t- <dig> cells  . we also transiently cotransfected avian df <dig> fibroblasts with pmir- <dig>  pmir-150mut or pcdna plasmids and the myb wt prl-tk vector. reporter assays in these cells confirmed that pmir- <dig> efficiently reduced myb wt reporter activity to about 60% . thus, in chickens, as in humans  <cit> , the repression of myb wt reporter activity by mir- <dig> does not seem to be cell type-specific and gga-mir- <dig>  like its orthologues in humans, mice and zebrafish  <cit> , specifically targets the 3'utr of myb.

gga-mir- <dig> uses a target site orthologous to that of zebrafish
we identified four putative mir- <dig> target sites in the chicken myb 3'utr , all matching the criteria for mirna target recognition and target site sequence context within the 3'utr  <cit> . sites s <dig> and s <dig>  located 85- <dig> nt and 830- <dig> nt downstream from the stop codon, respectively, were 7-mer-a <dig> sites containing the seed sequence with an additional a residue in target position  <dig> . such sites have been shown to be functional in various systems  <cit> . sites s <dig> and s <dig>  located 123- <dig> nt and 918- <dig> nt downstream from the stop codon, respectively, were 9-mer-a <dig> and 8-mer-a <dig> sites . these sites are probably at least as effective as the 8-mer sites shown to be functional in various systems, from worms to mammals  <cit> . additional pairing to the middle and the 3' end of gga-mir- <dig> was also observed, extending from one individual match to seven consecutive matches, for sites s <dig> and s <dig>  respectively . we generated myb mutant prl-tk vectors, each containing only one of the four mutated target sites , and one mutant containing all four mutated target sites . the various myb mutant prl-tk vectors were used to transfect either avian df <dig> fibroblasts  <cit>  or human 293ft cells, as described above. avian df- <dig> fibroblasts were used to assess gga-mir- <dig> site usage in the homologous system. we used human 293ft cells, originating from the hek-293t cell line, as a reference heterologous system, because the hek-293t cell line has been used to identify mir- <dig> target sites in mice, humans and zebrafish  <cit> . we then carried out reporter assays. the same reporter activity patterns were observed in both systems, demonstrating that the observed pattern of target site usage resulted from intrinsic characteristics of chicken c-myb 3'utr. we found that pmir- <dig> did not repress the activity of the myb mt <dig> reporter or the myb mt <dig> construct whereas the activities of myb mt <dig>  mt <dig> and mt <dig> were significantly repressed  . thus, gga-mir- <dig> specifically targets the 3'utr of avian myb, acting principally through target site s <dig> in both avian df- <dig> cells and human 293ft cells. the use of target site s <dig> by gga-mir- <dig> therefore seems to result from the intrinsic properties of the chicken myb 3'utr. the observed functionality of avian myb target site  <dig> is consistent with previous observations showing that higher levels of 3' base pairing render the site more effective  <cit> . although both target sites, s <dig> and s <dig>  display strong base pairing with the gga-mir- <dig> seed sequence, only site s <dig>  which also displays base pairing for  <dig> nt at its 3' end, is a functional target for gga-mir- <dig> . this observation highlights the importance of extended 3' pairing for gga-mir- <dig> 

recent studies have demonstrated that myb targeting by mir- <dig> has been conserved throughout evolution, as it is observed in mice, humans and zebrafish  <cit> . however, analysis of the targeting of myb 3' utr by mir- <dig> in the various species in which functional target sites have been validated has shown that mir- <dig> targeting seems to be dependent on the use of different target sites. synergy between two target sites located in the last third of the 3' utr of the human and murine c-myb genes is required for the regulation of these genes  <cit> , whereas only one target site about  <dig> nt downstream from the c-myb stop codon is functional in chicken and zebrafish . detailed analysis of the sequence of the 3' utr of myb from various species showed that the short 3'utrs of myb  and the 3' utr of myb orthologs of zebrafish contained two mir- <dig> target sites close together in the proximal region, less than  <dig> nt downstream from the stop codon, and that the large 3'utr of chickens and mammals contained two additional mir- <dig> target sites located close together, between  <dig> and  <dig> nt from the stop codon . however, not all these sites appeared functional and most non-functional ones were mutated, with the exception of site  <dig> in chicken . site  <dig>  for example, which is functional in chicken and zebrafish and has two conserved mutations in mammals, is not functional in mouse  <cit>  . surprisingly, despite the presence of sequence changes in site  <dig> rendering it non-functional in mammals , the 3' end sequences of this site identified in chicken and zebrafish were found to be strongly conserved throughout evolution, from frogs to humans , but were not sufficient for compensatory pairing  <cit> . we identified no functional role for target sites  <dig> and  <dig> in chicken myb, whereas gga-mir- <dig> targeted and repressed myb mt <dig> or mt <dig> reporter constructs but not myb mt <dig> reporter construct. the mutation of target site  <dig> completely abolished the repressor effect of gga-mir- <dig>  as observed with the mt <dig> reporter construct, in which all target sites were mutated. by contrast, mir- <dig> acts at sites s <dig> and s <dig> in mice and humans  <cit> . the mutation introduced into target site  <dig> of the chicken myb, resulting in the sequence involved in base pairing to the mir- <dig> seed sequence being one nucleotide shorter than in mammals , may account for the loss of function of this mutant site. this mutation may also affect the function of conserved site  <dig>  which was non-functional despite a perfect seed match of  <dig> nt. the observed non-functionality of target site  <dig> suggests that this site may be functional only in synergy with target site  <dig>  as observed in mammals  <cit>  .

features common to all mir-150/myb target sites have been identified in studies of different species: a perfect seed match of eight to nine nucleotides is required, with either additional 3' pairing or synergy with another closely located site. c-myb is the only member of the myb family of transcription factor genes targeted by mir- <dig> 

despite the sequence conservation between avian and mammalian myb 3'utrs making it possible to align these sequences, our observations suggest that the intrinsic characteristics of the avian myb 3'utr result in avian mir- <dig> selecting a target site different from its mammalian orthologs.

the intermediate evolutionary position of chickens in the vertebrate group may provide insight into the evolution of myb/mir- <dig> target sites. chicken has retained the same functional target site as zebrafish and, probably, frogs. this site appears to be the principal target site in chicken, despite the presence of the putative mammalian target sites in the chicken myb.

CONCLUSIONS
our study of the avian myb/gga-mir- <dig> interaction shows that, despite the involvement of c-myb in development and haematopoiesis in a wide range of organisms, from zebrafish to humans, and its regulation principally through mir- <dig>  the conservation of mir- <dig> target site functionality observed between chicken and zebrafish does not extend to mammals. an additional set of functional target sites has evolved in mammals, reflecting target site adaptation in these organisms.
