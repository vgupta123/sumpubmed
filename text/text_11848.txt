BACKGROUND
apicomplexan parasites employ a unique form of movement, termed gliding motility, to disseminate and invade host cells. the current model for gliding motility is centred on the actomyosin system of the parasite in force generation during this process. according to the ‘linear motor’ model, micronemal transmembrane proteins, such as mic <dig>  are secreted at the apical pole of the parasite and act as force transmitters by interacting with the substrate surface and the actomyosin system, similar to the role of integrins in other motility systems  <cit> . accordingly, this model predicts a smooth actomyosin dependent rearwards translocation of the microneme-substrate complex, which results in forward gliding on the substrate or into the host cell  <cit> . however, recent reverse genetic approaches demonstrated that parasites remain motile in the absence of what were thought to be key components of the motility machinery, including parasite actin . in an attempt to reconcile these data, we proposed a novel, hypothetical model based on gelation/solation  <cit> , where actin/myosin is required for force transmission rather than force production  <cit> . this model predicts the generation of an osmotic gradient that results in membrane tension and retrograde membrane flow. in order to regulate membrane balance, the parasite then either sheds membrane at the posterior end, as previously observed  <cit> , and/or recycles the membrane via endocytosis, as suggested for other systems  <cit> .

many other eukaryotic cells move by crawling, a process powered by the controlled assembly and disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton in proximity to the plasma membrane  <cit> . while it was previously assumed that the majority of the force for the retraction of the cell rear is powered by myosins, several alternative mechanisms can operate within the cell that also power motility  <cit> . for example, the motility of caenorhabditis elegans sperm occurs in the absence of any actin and therefore myosin activity  <cit> ; instead, force is generated by controlled polymerisation of the major sperm protein. furthermore, when tumour cells are confined within a microenvironment, motility depends on an osmotic engine and can be independent of actomyosin activity  <cit> . finally, migrating cells can employ various migration modes in response to their microenvironment  <cit> , which allows them to move even in the absence of adhesive coupling  <cit> . for example, crawling cells, such as dictyostelium and human leukocytes, can swim efficiently when suspended in a viscous medium  <cit> , demonstrating that adhesion to a solid substrate is not always necessary for movement  <cit> . it is thus possible that motility can be driven purely by surface membrane flow, which itself results from a secretory-endocytic cycle acting as a fluid drive from the anterior to the posterior end of the cell  <cit> . in support of membrane flow, many motile cells show a distinct capping activity of surface ligands  <cit> . furthermore, surface capping depends on vesicular transport, and both on actin and microtubule function  <cit> . in good agreement with these observations, numerous modulators of endocytic and secretory trafficking have been demonstrated to be key regulators of cell motility  <cit> , leading to the hypothesis that membrane transport and retrograde flow during motility are rate-limiting for cell forward translocation  <cit> .

in the case of apicomplexan parasites, a recent study demonstrated that retrograde membrane flow of malaria sporozoites occurs even at relatively high concentrations of the actin-disrupting drug cytochalasin d   <cit> . furthermore, biophysical studies on malaria sporozoites have demonstrated the discrete, localised turnover of attachment sites that are not evenly translocated along the surface of the parasite  <cit> . this involves the formation/disengagement of adhesion sites at the front and rear ends of the zoite, while the sporozoite undergoes a stretching phase. interestingly, actin is important for the definition and release of the attachment sites  <cit> , raising the possibility that apicomplexan motility may be similar to amoeboid-like crawling.

in t. gondii, an alternative explanation for the observed phenotypes for mutants of the actomyosin system is the possibility of functional redundancy of actomyosin components  <cit> . while redundancies cannot be ruled out, in particular for myosins and micronemal proteins  <cit> , even the removal of ostensibly critical structural proteins does not completely block gliding motility or host cell invasion. for example, removal of the gliding-associated protein gap <dig> results in the relocation of the remaining myoa-complex components to the cytosol and severe disruption of the inner membrane complex , within which the motor complex is normally anchored  <cit> . while these gap <dig> conditional knockout  parasites are completely blocked in host cell egress, they remain motile and can invade host cells  <cit> . these surprising findings have led to a reassessment of the mechanisms underlying parasite motility and host-cell invasion, as recently reviewed  <cit> . in fact, not only do the roles of the individual components need to be reanalysed, but also their orientation and organisation within the parasite  <cit> .

here, we show that, during motility, the actomyosin system of the parasite functions in attachment to the surface substrate, and may, therefore, act as force transmitter rather than a force generator. we provide evidence that retrograde membrane flow, which may play a role in force generation and motility, does not depend on an intact actomyosin system.

RESULTS
actin is undetectable within 96 h of removal of act <dig> in act <dig> cko
we previously reported that act <dig> is undetectable in act <dig> cko parasites 72 h after rapamycin-induced removal of act <dig>  <cit> . a subsequent study suggested that residual actin may, in fact, be present in some of these parasites as long as 5 days after rapamycin treatment  <cit> . this led us to re-address the question of residual actin levels in the act <dig> cko parasites, using additional antibodies and additional controls.

we began by comparing the specificity of different antibodies, from various labs, raised against apicomplexan actin . while immunoblot analysis suggested that all antibodies are highly specific for t. gondii actin without recognising host cell actin , some of the tested antibodies demonstrated significant cross-reactivity within the parasites when used for immunofluorescence analysis, as previously reported  <cit> . we performed ifas at 4 days  and 8 days  after rapamycin induction . notably, we found that the polyclonal antibodies employed previously to quantify actin levels in the act <dig> cko parasites  <cit>  showed a strong and persistent signal in proximity to the imc of the parasite. this signal remained unchanged between  <dig> and 8 days after rapamycin treatment, even though the parasites are no longer expressing levels of actin above background within 4 days of induction . since this apparent cross-reactivity would interfere with accurate quantification of actin levels, we focused on two other antibodies that were highly specific and showed no cross-reactivity .fig.  <dig> actin is almost undetectable as soon as 72 h after rapamycin induction of act <dig> excision. a quantitative immunofluorescence assay  of actin. vacuoles were stained with α-act <dig>  at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 96 h post rapamycin induction. fluorescence intensity was analysed using cellprofiler software. the internal background was calculated for each vacuole and was then subtracted from the calculated intensity and plotted with mean and 95% confidence intervals. dotted line shows the host cell background calculated using a yfp

consistent with other studies, we found that actin levels in wildtype  parasites were somewhat variable . similar results were obtained with other housekeeping genes such as myosin light chain  <dig>  and aldolase . importantly, no overlap of actin levels could be observed between controls and act <dig> cko parasites as early as 48 h after rapamycin-induced excision of act <dig> . at earlier time points  post induction, significant amounts of act <dig> were still detectable and protein levels were highly variable between vacuoles . nevertheless, act <dig> levels were significantly reduced in comparison to control vacuoles. importantly, 96 h after rapamycin induction, no act <dig> was detectable in yfp+ parasites. lack of act <dig> detection by ifa correlates well with a recent study suggesting that no f-actin can be formed approximately 48 h after the removal of act <dig>  <cit> , the inference being that g-actin levels fall below the critical concentration required for polymerisation.

in good agreement with this result, quantitative immunoblotting of act <dig> cko parasites at different time points post-induction demonstrated the loss of all or nearly all of the act <dig> as early as 72 h post induction , confirming previous results  <cit> .

in summary, our quantification demonstrates that actin is depleted in the act <dig> cko parasites between  <dig> and 96 h post induction. based on these observations, assays were performed in a time course up to 96 h after addition of rapamycin to adequately readdress the effects of act <dig> loss.

loss of actin results in deleterious phenotypes for apicoplast maintenance and host cell egress but not gliding motility and host cell invasion
we previously demonstrated that parasite actin is required for apicoplast maintenance and host cell egress  <cit> . these phenotypes were followed over time after act <dig> excision to estimate the time when g-actin levels are below the critical concentration in order to form f-actin. significant numbers of act <dig> cko parasites started to lose their apicoplasts as early as 24 h post-induction, indicating that once g-actin levels drop below a critical concentration, the apicoplast cannot be maintained during parasite replication . by 96 h after rapamycin induction of act <dig>  we were unable to see any parasitophorous vacuoles that had a normal number of apicoplasts . similar to apicoplast maintenance, host cell egress is significantly decreased as soon as 36 h post induction and was completely blocked 96 h post induction .fig.  <dig> phenotypic characterisation of the act <dig> conditional knockout  at various time points after rapamycin-induced gene excision. a quantification of apicoplast loss in the act <dig> cko over a time range. loss of the apicoplast was quantified at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 96 h after induction. vacuoles were stained with α-act <dig> and α-hsp <dig> and scored for the correct ratio of apicoplasts per parasite. the apicoplast is lost in > 50% of the act <dig> cko parasites as early as 24 h after rapamycin induction. error bars represent ± standard error of the mean . b representative images of apicoplast loss. yellow dotted lines indicate the edge of the vacuoles in greyscaled images. apicoplast loss occurs even when there is still act <dig> present . the apicoplast was stained with an antibody against hsp <dig>  <cit> . c egress in the act <dig> cko at different time points . vacuoles were stained with α-sag <dig> under non-permeabilising conditions and scored. three conditions were considered: lysed and moved out of the vacuole, lysis of the membranes without the release of parasites, and no lysis of the parasitophorous vacuole membrane or host membrane. error bars represent ± sem. d representative images of egress; at 72–96 h post induction, the act <dig> cko parasites are unable to lyse the membranes, as determined by positive sag <dig> staining without prior permeabilisation and are not released from the vacuoles. scale bars: 10 μm. e and f trail deposition and invasion assays for the act <dig> cko compared to wt  at time points  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 96 h after induction. after 48 h post induction, no significant change of trail deposition or invasion were observed, error bars represent ± standard error of the mean. all experiments were performed in biological triplicate and compared with a two-tailed student’s t-test, **** p <  <dig> , *** p <  <dig> , ** p <  <dig> , * p <  <dig>

next, we analysed the capability of act <dig> cko parasites to move by gliding motility and to invade the host cell at different time points after rapamycin induction . in good agreement with previous results  <cit> , overall motility and host cell invasion were significantly reduced in the act <dig> cko parasites, with less than approximately 25% being motile and capable of invading host cells compared to control parasites . this phenotype was observed as early as 48 h after rapamycin induction, at a time point when significant amounts of actin were still detectable . interestingly, and in striking contrast to the results with apicoplast inheritance and egress, gliding and invasion rates remained constant at 48–96 h post induction, suggesting that once actin levels fall below a critical concentration, these phenotypes are not further affected. the simplest explanation for this result is that apicoplast maintenance and egress are completely dependent on actin, whereas gliding and invasion can occur independent of actin, albeit at significantly reduced efficiencies.

a critical concentration of actin is required to sustain dense granule motility
a recent study demonstrated the essential role of actin and the unconventional myosin f  in directed dense granule transport  <cit> . to assess if potential, residual f-actin in act <dig> cko parasites is capable of serving as a track for myof-dependent dense granule transport, dense granule motions were tracked at various times after actin excision. in good agreement with the results obtained for apicoplast replication, parasite egress, parasite gliding and invasion, we observed an approximately 50% reduction in the percentage of granules moving in a directed manner from 37% in control to 14% as early as 18 h post excision . at  <dig> and 72 h post excision, directed granule motion was completely ablated  given that the percentage of trajectories in each population was indistinguishable from simulated pure 2d diffusion analysed using the changepoint algorithm  .

the observation of diminished granule movement soon after induction provides further evidence that apicomplexan actin in vivo requires a critical monomer concentration  in order to form sufficient f-actin to serve as a substrate for myosin motors such as myof. we therefore conclude that act <dig> cko parasites are a powerful tool to analyse actin-independent motility and invasion processes.

conventional actin disrupting drugs are not exclusively specific for toxoplasma actin
intriguingly, the phenotypes described above differ significantly from the effects caused by incubating parasites in the presence of drugs used to modulate f-actin turnover, such as cd or latrunculins. for example, treatment of intracellular parasites with cd results in the formation of huge residual bodies, where organelles such as the apicoplast or secretory organelles accumulate  <cit> , which is not observed in the case of the act <dig> cko parasites  <cit> .

our finding that parasites remain motile in the absence of act <dig> further suggests that cd might act on an unknown target, a hypothesis supported by an earlier study in which cd resistant parasites were isolated that do not have any mutations in tgact <dig>  <cit> . to test this hypothesis, we generated a parasite line where endogenous actin has been replaced with a loxp-flanked copy of act <dig> containing a mutation  that confers cd resistance  <cit>  and can be excised in a dicre-dependent manner . consequently, these parasites only express cd resistant actin before removal of act1
cdr. we compared the cd sensitivity of this new parasite line, called act1
cdr cko, to that of control  parasites, cytdr parasites  <cit>  and the act <dig> cko parasites. interestingly, the gliding rates of all parasite lines, including cytdr parasites, were significantly reduced at higher concentrations of cd  and it appeared the act1-specific effect was limited to ≤  <dig>  μm cd . the observed reduction in motility of cytdr parasites is consistent with a previous study, demonstrating loss of motility in the presence of 1 μm cd  <cit> . importantly, in the absence of act <dig> or act1cdr, parasites remained sensitive to cd ; in both cases, the gliding rate was reduced from approximately 20% in untreated parasites to 1% in the presence of high cd concentrations, indicating that cd was acting on  yet unidentified target in a non-act <dig> specific manner in t. gondii. conclusions drawn from experiments using high concentrations of cd should, therefore, be interpreted with caution. next, we tested the parasites’ ability to glide in the presence of the f-actin polymerisation drug jasplakinolide . jas was previously found to block attachment and motility of p. berghei sporozoites  <cit> . at lower concentrations, t. gondii tachyzoites are inhibited in both circular and helical gliding but exhibit a counter-clockwise twirling motion  <cit> . in agreement with previous findings, we found that forcing polymerisation blocks motility in wt parasites, whereas no significant reduction is observed for the act <dig> cko . we also tested latrunculins a and b, independent f-actin disrupting drugs that have been previously described to act on apicomplexan actin  <cit> . surprisingly, even at 1 μm, we were unable to observe any significant effect on gliding rates , demonstrating that latrunculins are not acting on toxoplasma tachyzoite actin. this conclusion supports previous observations for plasmodium berghei gliding motility  <cit> . in addition, the pfact <dig> crystal structure suggests that latrunculins should not effectively bind apicomplexan act <dig>  <cit> .fig.  <dig> conventional actin disrupting drugs are not exclusively specific for toxoplasma actin. evaluation of the off-target effect of cytochalasin d . a generation of an inducible cd resistant actin strain . schematic of the inducible cd resistant act <dig> conditional knockout  geneswap vector, encoding the act <dig> resistance mutation for cd , flanked by loxp sites with a reporter cassette of yfp. analytical pcr checked integration with primer sets highlighted in the schematic. b trail deposition assay for rh, cytdr, act <dig> cko and act <dig> ckocdr treated with increasing concentrations of cd . no significant difference in gliding rates was observed between the act <dig> cko or act <dig> ckocdr. the cytdr parasites are inhibited in gliding motility at high concentrations of cd . error bars represent ± standard error of the mean . c trail deposition assay of rh parasites and act <dig> cko parasites in 1 μm jas. forcing polymerisation blocks motility in wildtype cells but has no additional effect on act <dig> cko. error bars represent ± sem. d, e latrunculins have no effect on parasite motility. parasites treated with increasing concentrations of either latrunculin a  or latrunculin b . error bars represent ± sem. all experiments were performed in biological triplicate and the datasets were compared with a two-tailed student’s t-test, **** p <  <dig> , non-significance  p > <dig> 




in summary, the experiments presented above demonstrate that, in the absence of actin, less than 25% of parasites remain capable of gliding motility and host cell invasion and establish act <dig> cko parasites as a valuable tool for understanding the role of actin in the invasion and gliding mechanisms of t. gondii. the observed phenotype for the act <dig> cko parasites is very similar to the phenotype observed for a clonal knockout for myoa  <cit> . we therefore re-addressed the role of myosins during gliding motility.

expression levels of myoc determine its localisation to the imc in the myoa ko
it was previously suggested that myoc can compensate for myoa motor function in myoa ko parasites  <cit> . in addition, it has been shown that myoa and myoc can interact with the same light chain, mlc <dig>  and expression of myoc from a heterologous promoter demonstrated a certain degree of myoc association with the parasite pellicle in the absence of myoa  <cit> .

in order to address if the localisation of myoc at the imc in the myoa ko parasites depends on the level of myoc expression, we expressed a second copy of tymyoc under the control of either a strong promoter, p5rt <dig>  <cit> , or its own promoter, pmyoc, and compared its localisation with that of an endogenously tagged version .fig.  <dig> expression levels of myoc determine localisation to the inner membrane complex in the myoa knockout  parasites. a schematics of the plasmid  and localisation of myoc under different expression levels in both rh Δhxgprt and myoa ko . a constitutive overexpression  and myoc under its endogenous promoter , these constructs were randomly integrated. the endogenous myoc locus was tagged in rh Δku <dig> via double homologous recombination . schematic represents the final locus. scale bar: 2 μm. b corrected cell fluorescence intensities for different myoc expression levels were measured using α-ty. one-way anova followed by tukey’s post hoc test was used to compare means between groups. *** p <  <dig> , non-significance  p >  <dig> . c plaque assay of myoa ko expressing the three different constructs. rh Δhxgprt was used as the control. the plaque area was measured using imagej with error bars representing ± standard deviation . one-way anova followed by tukey’s post hoc test was used to compare means between groups. **** p <  <dig> , ** p <  <dig> 




while strong expression of myoc results in efficient relocalisation from the parasite basal end to the periphery of the myoa ko parasites , as previously reported  <cit> , expression of myoc under its own promoter or endogenously-tagged myoc showed only slight relocalisation, with the majority of the protein being correctly localised to the basal ring of the parasites. this demonstrates that the localisation of myoc to the imc is critically dependent on strong expression levels of the protein, which are not reached with native myoc expression levels in the myoa ko parasite . we next analysed propagation of these parasite strains using plaque assays and found that the relative plaque size is larger in myoa ko parasites strongly overexpressing myoc compared to parasites expressing myoc under the control of pmyoc . this demonstrates that overexpression of myoc can partially complement the phenotype of the myoa ko parasites . since the localisation of myoc to the imc is apparently critical for complementation of the myoa ko parasites, we decided to analyse mlc <dig> cko in more detail, given that mlc <dig> is thought to be required to anchor both myoa and myoc to the pellicle  <cit> .

parasites lacking mlc <dig> can be maintained in cell culture for several weeks
we previously analysed the mlc <dig> cko 96 h after rapamycin induction; based on qualitative immunofluorescence analysis, no mlc <dig> was detectable at this time point  <cit> . to verify that mlc <dig> is depleted at 96 h, we quantified mlc <dig> protein levels by ifa, analogous to act <dig> quantification described above . we confirmed that, as early as 48 h after induction, no mlc <dig> can be detected in the cko parasites; this was also confirmed using immunoblot analysis . we succeeded in keeping mlc <dig> cko parasites in cell culture for several weeks by mechanically releasing parasites and enriching the culture using facs, demonstrating that mlc <dig> is essential for egress but dispensable for the following rounds of invasion and replication .fig.  <dig> parasites without mlc <dig> can be maintained in cell culture for several weeks. a mlc <dig> proteins levels were evaluated by measuring the fluorescence intensity of vacuoles stained with α-mlc <dig> at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 96 h post induction. fluorescence intensity was analysed using cellprofiler software. the lower dashed line indicates the fluorescence background in the red channel obtained by using the yfp+ parasite strain without antibodies. bars indicate mean with 95% confidence intervals. one-way anova followed by tukey’s post hoc test was used to compare means between groups. **** p <  <dig> , non-significance  p >  <dig> . b western blot analysis of sorted mlc <dig> conditional knockout  parasites to determine the protein levels of myoa and mlc <dig>  catalase was used as loading control. c

next, we were interested in the localisation of myoa and myoc in mlc <dig> cko parasites. to determine this, we generated two independent lines for colocalization studies, one expressing ty-tagged myoa under the control of its endogenous promoter  and another with endogenously ty-tagged myoc . myoa is completely undetectable at the parasite’s pellicle 72 h after rapamycin-induced excision of mlc <dig> , demonstrating that mlc <dig> is crucial for the localization and stability of myoa. in contrast, myoc remains present and shows a normal localization at the basal end of the parasite in the absence of mlc <dig> .

in summary, we have generated and validated important parasite strains that can be used to analyse the role of the actomyosin system during gliding motility and host cell invasion and to investigate alternative mechanisms for these essential processes.

kinetic analysis of actin and myosin independent motility and invasion
we previously demonstrated that conditional mutants for act <dig>  mlc <dig> and myoa invade the host cell via the tight junction, demonstrating that these parasites still use an active invasion mechanism and are not passively taken up by the host cell via phagocytosis  <cit> . however, kinetic analysis of myoa ko parasites demonstrated that both gliding speed and penetration times are significantly reduced, validating a direct function of myoa during these processes. we were interested how act <dig> cko, mlc <dig> cko and myoa ko would compare during gliding motility and invasion.

to date, characterisation of gliding motility mainly depends on trail deposition assays, which allow a good estimate of overall motility rates. however, motility rates can be reduced by several factors, such as reduced or increased parasite attachment to the surface, and does not allow a firm conclusion regarding the function of a protein during this process. we speculated that parasites depleted in crucial parts of the actomyosin system should move significantly differently in terms of gliding speed and/or average distance travelled.

therefore, we performed time-lapse analysis of gliding parasites  to assess the ability of parasites to generate the necessary force for motility in the presence and absence of the actomyosin system of the parasite. we confirm that myoa ko parasites show significantly lower trajectory length  and an average speed of approximately  <dig>  μm/sec, as reported previously  <cit> . intriguingly, in the case of act <dig> cko and mlc <dig> cko parasites both average trajectory length and speed are increased compared to myoa ko parasites . while helical motility was significantly affected, with shorter average trajectories and reduced speed, circular gliding motility appeared relatively normal for mlc <dig> cko and act <dig> cko parasites . in good agreement with the gliding data, we found that host cell invasion can occur rapidly in act <dig> cko and mlc <dig> cko parasites, though several slow invasion events can be observed . as is the case for gliding motility, the invasion of myoa ko parasites appears to be more strongly affected, with slower invasion events compared to act <dig> cko and mlc <dig> cko. this demonstrates that the parasite is capable of producing the force for motility and invasion in the absence of the actomyosin motor and suggests that actomyosin may instead be required to coordinate the force, most likely by regulating attachment sites, as observed in plasmodium sporozoites  <cit>  and other diverse motility systems  <cit> .fig.  <dig> kinetic analysis of 2d gliding and invasion of myoa motor complex mutants. 2d analysis of gliding kinetics. a graphic displays the average trajectory of  <dig> tracked parasites moving in helical  and circular fashion . b average speed of each motility boost of  <dig> tracked parasites for each strain. trajectory, distance and time of moving parasites were tracked using the program imagej-wrmtrck. values expressed are average ± standard deviation. c image series show time lapse video microscopy of rh Δhxgprt, act <dig> conditional knockout  and mlc <dig> cko gliding kinetics. circular and helical motions were recorded at one frame per second and analysed using the fiji wrmtrck software. software-generated tracks are overlaid in different times along parasites position. scale bar represents 10 μm, numbers indicate time in minutes.seconds. d image series showing real time invasion assays of rh Δhxgprt, act <dig> cko and mlc <dig> cko. real time invading parasites were recorded at one frame per second in dic with a final image taken with fitc for the act <dig> cko and mlc <dig> cko to distinguish the yfp+ knockouts. orange arrows indicate the tight junction from initial formation to closure. scale bar represents 10 μm, numbers indicate time in minutes:seconds. e penetration time of indicated strains determined by time lapse microscopy from tight junction formation to closure. invasion events and time were tracked and calculated manually using the time stamper tool. error bars represent ± standard deviation, n =  <dig> invasion events

kinetics of 3d motility: myoc cannot compensate for the loss of myoa motor function
next, we employed a matrigel-based 3d motility assay to characterise the motility phenotypes of the mutants generated  <cit>  under more physiological conditions. in good agreement with the time-lapse analysis of parasites gliding in 2d  <cit> , a significantly decreased proportion of the myoa ko parasites was able to move in matrigel compared to the parental line  . of the myoa ko parasites that were classified as motile, there was also a significant reduction in mean trajectory displacement and mean instantaneous speed compared to the parental line. overexpression of ty-tagged myoc driven by the p5rt <dig> promoter in the myoa ko parasites was able to restore the percentage of moving parasites to wt levels and produce a modest increase in the mean trajectory displacement but not instantaneous speed . when we extended the analysis to examine mlc <dig> cko and act <dig> cko parasites, the results likewise closely mirrored those of the 2d assay  – excision of mlc <dig> or act <dig> significantly reduced the percentage of moving parasites and mean trajectory displacement, but did not affect the mean instantaneous speed compared to their respective parental lines . of note, it appears that mean trajectory displacement is more impacted in a 3d environment than in 2d, with few mutant parasites showing a displacement of more than one parasite length , perhaps because they have to overcome more resistance in order to move in the matrigel.fig.  <dig> 3d motility of the myoa knockout , mlc <dig> conditional knockout  and act <dig> cko parasites. a maximum intensity projections  for parental , myoa ko and p5rt70-ty-myoc-expressing myoa ko parasites. b the percentage of total parasites moving , mean trajectory displacement  and mean instantaneous speed  were significantly reduced for the myoa ko parasites . of these motility parameters, p5rt70-ty-myoc  restored the percentage of moving parasites back to wildtype levels , and partially restored the mean trajectory displacement, but was unable to complement the decrease in mean instantaneous speed. c mips for parental  and mlc <dig> cko parasites. d the percentage of total parasites moving  and mean trajectory displacement  were significantly reduced for the mlc <dig> cko parasites  but the mean instantaneous speed remained unaffected. e mips for parental  and act <dig> cko parasites. f the percentage of total parasites moving  and mean trajectory displacement  were significantly reduced for the act <dig> cko parasites , but the mean instantaneous speed remained unaffected. data shown are the results of three independent experiments , with each experiment performed in triplicate except for the induced ko samples , for which six technical replicates were performed per biological replicate due to low numbers of moving parasites. datasets were compared by two-way anova with sidak’s multiple comparisons test. error bars = sem. the total number of parasites analysed was  <dig> for loxpmyoa,  <dig> for myoa ko,  <dig> for myoa ko + p5rt70-ty-myoc,  <dig> for loxpmlc <dig>   <dig> for mlc <dig> cko,  <dig> for loxpact <dig>  and  <dig> for act <dig> cko. a 2-μm trajectory displacement cut-off was applied to exclude stationary parasites from calculations for mean trajectory speed and displacement . scale bar; 50 μm. *** p <  <dig> , **** p <  <dig> , ns = not significant. the colour scheme for all mips was inverted for better visualisation of parasite trajectories




the actomyosin system is required for surface attachment
to test the role of actin and the glideosome in attachment to surfaces, we employed flow chambers coated with collagen . to this end, we tested the ability of the myoa ko, mlc <dig> cko and act <dig> cko parasites to withstand shear flow stress. while surface attachment of myoa ko parasites was similar to wt controls, both the mlc <dig> cko and act <dig> cko parasites were unable to promote efficient attachment to the surface and were removed even at very low shear flow rates . only rh and the myoa ko can withstand shear forces up to 15 dyn/cm <dig>  which is within the range of arterial shear stress  <cit> . these results suggest that the reason many act <dig> cko and mlc <dig> cko parasites cannot initiate gliding  is that they cannot attach sufficiently to the surface. these data suggest that the actomyosin system is required to coordinate the formation and release of attachment sites observed in a variety of other motility systems  <cit> , including plasmodium sporozoites  <cit> .fig.  <dig> attachment under fluidic shear stress. evaluation of attachment under fluidic shear stress. a percentage of parasites retained under fluidic stress relative to zero flow for rh, myoa knockout , mlc <dig> conditional knockout  and act <dig> cko strains. data accumulated from n =  <dig> experiments for each strain, trendline ± standard deviation shown. b bar graph showing relative percentage of parasites retained after 15 dyn/cm <dig> fluidic shear stress. the dataset was compared with a two-tailed student’s t-test: ns, non-significant and * p <  <dig> . c representative images at  <dig> and 15 dyn/cm <dig> fluidic shear stress. d magnified inset of panel  showing individual parasites. internal controls were used for comparison in each experiment. myoa ko: myoa ko non-fluorescent and gfp fluorescent rh control, mlc <dig> cko: mlc cko yfp fluorescent and non-fluorescent rh control, act <dig> cko: act <dig> cko yfp fluorescent and non-fluorescent rh control. scale bar 100 μm




bead translocation does not depend on the actomyosin system
apicomplexan parasites are known to translocate beads from the apical to the basal end and such ‘capping activity’ has been directly implicated in the motility of many cell types, including plasmodium sporozoites  <cit> . interestingly, treatment of sporozoites with cd had no significant effect on the speed of retrograde flow, while the force generated at the attached bead was reduced  <cit> . this could also be explained by the reduced formation of attachment sites, meaning a failure in force transmission rather than production. we therefore wished to analyse if retrograde membrane flow can occur in absence of the actomyosin system.

we modified a bead translocation assay first developed by king et al. over 30 years ago  <cit> . incubation of parasites with latex nano-beads leads to efficient binding of beads along the surface of the parasites and, within 10 min, 51% of parasites translocated beads to the parasite’s basal end . we next tested the role of the actomyosin system in the process of bead translocation, using either pharmacological perturbation or parasite mutants. in these experiments, we classified parasites as either ‘unbound’, ‘bound-uncapped’ or ‘capped’ . when parasites were kept in endo buffer, which is known to diminish microneme secretion and motility  <cit> , we found that a significant number of parasites were incapable of binding and translocating beads . when we tested the role of the actomyosin system in bead translocation , no abrogation of bead translocation was observed, suggesting the presence of retrograde flow in absence of the actomyosin system. interestingly, in the mlc <dig> cko, myoa ko or parasites treated with cd, fewer beads appeared to bind to the parasite surface , confirming a role of the actomyosin system in attachment. nevertheless, capping in the act <dig> cko occurred normally compared to rh when we assume that capped beads must have firstly bound. similarly, the addition of cd had only minor effects on capping in the wt parasites. overall, this demonstrates that bead translocation, and therefore the establishment of retrograde membrane flow, can occur independently of the actomyosin system of the parasite.fig.  <dig> analysis of bead translocation. a three types of interactions of parasites with beads were observed ; no interaction , beads located all around the parasite , and beads translocated to the posterior end of the parasite . kinetics of bead translocation on wildtype parasites  ; the percentage of parasites showing a capped pattern at each time point is indicated. b representative images of bead assays at 10 min in different genetic backgrounds, illustrating the binding and capping capacity of rh, myoa knockout , act <dig> conditional knockout  and mlc <dig> cko parasites. c the amount of bead binding and capping was quantified after 10 min incubation in different parasite strains: un-bound , bound  and capped . c rh, cytochalasin-d  resistant , myoa ko, mlc <dig> cko, act <dig> cko parasites, and rh incubated in endo-buffer . capping in the presence of  <dig>  μm cd was also evaluated for wildtype and cytdr parasites. the percentage of bead interaction with the parasites’ surface was significantly reduced in the rh endo and act <dig> cko parasites. capping still occurs in all ko mutant strains. results are representative of at least three independent experiments ± standard deviation with at least  <dig> parasites counted per experiment, per condition 




discussion
in this study, we set out to reconcile currently conflicting interpretations regarding the role of the apicomplexan actomyosin system during gliding motility and host cell invasion  <cit> . while there is no doubt about a critical role of the actomyosin system during motility and invasion, alternative models and mechanisms regarding the exact function of this system have been put forward based on biophysical, reverse genetic and inhibitor studies  <cit> . indeed, several observations cannot be easily reconciled with the canonical linear motor model:  biophysical studies on malaria sporozoites demonstrate the discrete, localised turnover of attachment sites that are not evenly translocated along the surface of the parasite  <cit> . adhesion sites are formed/disengaged at the front and rear ends of the zoite, while the sporozoite undergoes a stretching phase. interestingly, actin is important for the definition and release of the attachment sites  <cit> , raising the possibility that apicomplexan motility is similar to amoeboid-like crawling.  eimeria sporozoites show different types of motility . while pivoting appeared substrate- and actin-dependent, bending showed resistance to the actin-disrupting drug cytochalasin b  <cit> .  a recent study demonstrates that retrograde membrane flow of malaria sporozoites occurs even at relatively high concentrations of the actin-disrupting drug cd  <cit> .  reverse genetic approaches demonstrated that parasites remain motile in the absence of molecules thought to be key components of the motor machinery, including parasite actin .

in the case of reverse genetic studies, other groups have suggested that the observed phenotypes are due either to the presence of redundancies within the repertoire of genes involved in motility and invasion  <cit>  or to an unusually stable actin , which persists many days and parasite generations after gene excision and can polymerize via an unusual isodesmic process that does not require a critical monomer  concentration  <cit> . while isodesmic polymerisation has been demonstrated in vitro, its in vivo relevance is unclear  <cit> . previous polymerisation studies used g-actin produced in heterologous protein expression systems. however, a recent study demonstrated that apicomplexan actin is not properly folded when heterologously expressed due to differences in the chaperonin t-complex  <cit> . furthermore, a recent study suggests that toxoplasma actin is capable of forming f-actin structures in vivo that depend on a critical monomer concentration and demonstrates that f-actin is involved in multiple essential processes during intracellular parasite growth such as daughter cell assembly, vacuole organisation and parasite egress  <cit> . using a conditional knockout for act <dig> it was demonstrated that no act <dig> filament formation can occur as early as 48 h after removal of act <dig>  <cit> . finally, although apicomplexans possess actin-like proteins, it is unlikely that they can compensate for act <dig> and form filaments  <cit> . here, we performed a careful quantification of actin levels at different time points in the act <dig> conditional knockout and find that actin is still detectable at 48 h, but fully depleted by 96 h after induction with rapamycin.

in good agreement with previous studies  <cit> , we observed essential roles of actin in apicoplast segregation, host cell egress and dense granule motility upon deletion of act <dig>  while parasite motility and host cell invasion still occur, albeit at significantly reduced levels. since these findings were in direct conflict with a number of studies that use actin-modulating drugs to probe for actin function, we also performed an analysis of the effects of the actin-disrupting drugs cd, lata, and latb, and the actin-stabilising drug jas on wt and act <dig> cko parasites. while the effect of jas appears to be specific for actin, since treatment of act <dig> cko parasites showed no effect of this drug, we find that cd is not uniquely specific for actin, since similar effects on parasite motility can be observed irrespective if wt, act <dig> cko or parasites expressing act1cdr were analysed. while cd is certainly acting on parasite actin, as indicated by the significant differences between wt and cytdr parasites, we find that concentrations above  <dig>  μm cd lead to significant, non-actin-dependent effects on parasite motility, confirming previous studies  <cit> . in contrast, lata and latb, previously used to analyse the role of apicomplexan actin  <cit> , appear to have no effect on tachyzoite actin, as noted previously. together, these data indicate great care should be taken in choosing the correct concentration for actin-modulating drugs, especially when using cd, where an independent, unknown target appears to be present in t. gondii  <cit> .

though all myosins are thought to depend on f-actin to function as a motor and, therefore, the act <dig> cko likely reflects the cumulative phenotype of all myosins, we were interested in the extent of redundancy between myoa and myoc, since previous studies indicated that myoc can complement a myoa deficiency  <cit> . while we confirm that myoc can partially complement for myoa function, this complementation appears to depend on overexpression and consequent localisation of myoc at the imc. indeed, our localisation analysis of myoc in wt and myoa ko parasites demonstrates that, under physiological conditions, no significant relocation of myoc to the imc can be detected. in contrast, strong overexpression leads to redistribution of myoc to the imc, as described previously  <cit> . this redistribution appears to be also critical for functional complementation, leading to a higher ratio of motile parasites and host cell invasion. however, myoc cannot compensate for myoa function completely, since the parasites overexpressing myoc remain as slow as uncomplemented myoa ko parasites. these results are also in good agreement with a recent study demonstrating that myoa is the central myosin involved in host cell invasion and that, in the absence of myoa, host cell membrane dynamics play an important role in invasion  <cit> . importantly, deletion of mlc <dig> results in a complete loss of the motor complex at the imc, therefore representing a functional double ko for myoa and mlc <dig>  this mutant can be kept in cell culture indefinitely when the strong egress phenotype is bypassed by artificially releasing the parasites, followed by enrichment of the population using facs, demonstrating that mlc <dig> is not essential for motility and host cell invasion per se. indeed, mlc <dig> cko parasites behave similarly to act <dig> cko regarding motility and attachment to the surface.

together, this analysis suggests a role for the actomyosin system during parasite motility that is distinct from the canonical linear motor model. we hypothesise that, rather than being the force generator during motility, the actomyosin system is instead involved in the regulation of attachment sites that are required to transmit the motility force to the substrate. to address this hypothesis, we used the above mutants to analyse different parameters that are likely crucial for efficient parasite motility such as attachment strength and retrograde membrane flow. we found that most act <dig> cko and mlc <dig> cko parasites remain immobile. however, those that move do so at speeds similar to wt parasites, albeit with shorter trajectories, suggesting that the actomyosin system is required to initiate and maintain motility. in a 3d environment the motility defects are stronger than in a 2d environment, with most parasites showing a displacement of less than one parasite length . in contrast, these mutants are virtually unable to attach, as measured under flow conditions, indicating an important role in the formation of attachment sites, as previously suggested  <cit> . unlike the mlc <dig> cko and act <dig> cko, myoa ko parasites show strong attachment to the surface, but significantly reduced speeds that cannot be compensated by overexpressing myoc. we interpret these data to indicate that actin is required to form attachment sites, whereas myoa might be required for the regulated release of these sites, leading to efficient force transmission during motility. a role for myosins in regulating adhesion and thereby traction force has recently been demonstrated  <cit> . here, the balance between myosin contraction and adhesion strength determines the frequency of motility initiation  <cit> . a similar regulation of myosin contraction might occur in the case of apicomplexans in order to initiate motility and failure to do so could result in reduced motility rates. in this scenario, how is the motility and invasive force produced by the parasite? previous studies implicated the generation of a retrograde membrane flow in parasite motility  <cit> . interestingly, the flow itself is relatively resistant to actin-modulating drugs. here, we modified a bead translocation assay as an indicator of retrograde membrane flow  <cit>  to analyse the role of act <dig>  mlc <dig> and myoa in establishing membrane flow. surprisingly, while fewer beads bind to the surface of the parasite in the absence of these proteins, bead translocation itself appears to be not significantly affected, again indicating a role of the actomyosin system in the formation of attachment sites , but not in bead translocation. future experiments and tools will be required to carefully address the role of retrograde membrane flow in force production and its exact role, if any, during motility and invasion.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our study demonstrates the importance of the actomyosin system during motility and invasion. it is worth noting that, in physiological settings, this system is absolutely essential for parasite viability. in fact, in vivo experiments with myoa ko parasites demonstrate the complete inability of these parasites to establish an infection or to induce an adaptive immune response . however, it is important to understand the molecular functions of the components of the gliding and invasion machinery in order to obtain a clear picture of how the individual components of this fascinating system work together to allow the parasite to move, invade into and egress from the host cell.
