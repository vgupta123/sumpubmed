BACKGROUND
apolipoprotein b  is a component of the ldl, lp and chylomicron lipoprotein particles  <cit> . the full-length apob <dig> isoform is mainly synthesized in the liver and is assembled into ldl and lp. the pre-mrna is subject to intestine-specific rna editing by a complex known as the editosome, which includes a catalytic subunit, apobec- <dig>  and several auxiliary factors. editing occurs in exon  <dig> at position  <dig> of the mrna converting a c to a u, generating a premature termination codon , and producing a c-terminal truncated isoform, apob <dig>  this isoform is assembled into the chylomicron particle and is unable to bind the ldl receptor  <cit> . the constitutively spliced exon  <dig> of apob is also unusual in that it is  <dig>  nt long, far longer than the mean length of exons in the genome at  <dig> nt  <cit> .

pre-mrna contains sequence elements defining the 5′ and 3′ ends of introns and the branch point. in mammals, the consensus sequences of these elements are highly degenerate  <cit> . as a result, matches to these consensus sequences are highly prevalent throughout the genome  <cit>  and outnumber genuine splice sites by an order of magnitude in the human hprt gene  <cit> . these pseudo splice sites are not normally employed in splicing. how the spliceosome is able to differentiate the few genuine splice sites from numerous pseudo splice sites is as yet unclear.

other sequences within the pre-mrna have been suggested to influence the choice between pseudo splice sites and genuine splice sites to allow accurate and reproducible splicing at the latter. exonic and intronic splicing enhancer sequences  have been characterized, and in general these act by binding sr proteins which interact with the spliceosome to favour the use of particular splice sites  <cit> . intronic and exonic splicing silencer sequences , which discourage the use of particular splice sites, have also been identified on functional and bioinformatic grounds  <cit> . silencing elements bind silencing factors such as hnrnp a <dig>  <cit> , polypyrimidine tract binding protein  <cit>  and hnrnp h  <cit> . the balance between enhancing factors  and silencing factors  determines the selection of splice sites and alternative splicing  <cit> .

most of the pseudo splice sites in the human genome reside in introns, by virtue of their long lengths  <cit> . long exons such as apob exon  <dig>  also contain many pseudo splice sites . correctly orientated pseudo 3′ and 5′ splice sites should trigger exon definition and erroneous splicing within the exon  <dig> sequence  <cit> . alternatively, the genuine splice sites could be identified via a process of intron definition. this relies on the recognition of 5′ and 3′ splice site pairs over short introns < <dig> nt in drosophila <cit> . in human nuclear extracts and in hela cells, intron definition appears to operate below a threshold of 200– <dig> nt  <cit> . intron definition, therefore, cannot easily explain the splicing of apob exon  <dig> as the upstream intron y and the downstream intron z are too long at  <dig> and  <dig> nt respectively. apob exon  <dig> provides a crucial test case for the hypothesis that the configuration of ese and ess within the pre-mrna is important for the accurate and reproducible splicing of long exons.

RESULTS
apob exon  <dig> contains many pseudo splice sites
in order to assess the number of pseudo splice sites within apob exon  <dig>  we scanned the genomic sequence of apob for matches to the 5′ and 3′ splice sites consensus sequences using the position score matrix of shapiro and senapathy  <cit> . a higher score out of  <dig> indicates a stronger splice site, and provides an estimate of the likelihood of a sequence being identified as an exon boundary and utilised in splicing. the genuine splice sites delineating the internal exons 2– <dig> were identified . the weakest 5′ splice site was that of exon  <dig>  and the weakest 3′ splice site was that of exon  <dig> . using  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively as the thresholds for the search,  <dig> 5′ splice sites with scores ≥ <dig>  and  <dig> 3′ splice sites with scores ≥ <dig>  were identified within the sequence of apob exon  <dig> .


the 3′ splice site flanking exon  <dig> scored  <dig>  and the 5′ splice site scored  <dig>  . using the exon  <dig> flanking scores of  <dig>  and  <dig>  as thresholds,  <dig> 3′ splice sites and two 5′ splice sites within exon  <dig> were identified as closer matches to the consensus with higher scores than the genuine splice sites flanking exon  <dig>  on theoretical grounds, therefore, each of these pseudo splice sites could be used in preference to the genuine splice sites, generating two possible 3′ shortened alternatives combining the 5′ pseudo splice sites with the 3′ splice site flanking exon  <dig>  and  <dig> possible 5′ shortened alternatives combining the 3′ pseudo splice sites with the 5′ splice site flanking exon  <dig> 

a search was also made for plausible pseudo-exons within the length of exon  <dig> using this subset of high-scoring pseudo splice sites. these were defined as sequences bounded by 3′ and 5′ pseudo splice sites in the right orientation, with lengths of 39–374 bp, these being the range of lengths for the other apob internal exons. using these criteria at least  <dig> alternative pseudo-exons could be identified that contain pseudo splice sites that are a better fit to the consensus than the genuine splice sites, and which on these bioinformatic criteria are more plausible exons than exon  <dig> itself.

using an alternative method to identify splice sites, maximum entropy modelling  of the same region identified five 3′ splice sites and one alternative 5′ splice site within exon  <dig> which score higher than the native 3′ and 5′ splice sites  <cit> . again using the same criteria, one strong pseudo-exon of 143 bp, with an appropriately positioned high scoring branch site was identified   <cit> . both these methods therefore identify plausible pseudo-exons which should in theory be spliced into the apob mrna instead of the actual exon  <dig> 

apob exon  <dig> contains multiple silencing sequences along its length
we hypothesized that ess might be responsible for silencing the pseudo splice sites, with two possible architectures for ess in exon  <dig>  firstly, a single or a few strong ess sequences might exist which are able to influence large areas of exon  <dig>  similar to hnrnp a <dig>  this is able to bind to high affinity sites, cooperatively bind, propagate along an exon, and antagonize sr protein function  <cit> . in this context it should be noted that exon  <dig> contains sequences that resemble consensus high-affinity hnrnp a <dig> sites  <cit>  such as 2666– <dig>  and 4114– <dig> . secondly, exon  <dig> might contain multiple ess distributed along the length of the exon.

the length of exon  <dig> makes it difficult to test for the existence of ese and ess in exon  <dig> in their native context. therefore, we turned to a heterologous splicing reporter, dna ligase iii. this two-exon construct contains a c exon and an alternatively spliced ß exon which is controlled by an ess within the ß exon. deletion of the ess allows c to splice to ß efficiently in vitro <cit> . candidate sequences derived from exon  <dig> were therefore cloned at the 3′ end of the ß exon, replacing the native ess, and these constructs were transcribed and tested for splicing in vitro . suppression of c-ß splicing indicates presence of ess activity within the candidate sequence.

figure 2b shows the results of testing non-overlapping  <dig> nt fragments derived from exon  <dig> in this system. dna ligase iii c-ß splices efficiently, as does a control construct containing  <dig> nt of igf-i exons  <dig> and  <dig>  tagged to the 3′ end of dna ligase iii c-ß . however, tagging 376– <dig> nt fragments of exon  <dig> causes silencing of splicing of the c-ß intron , with variable silencing activity – compare lanes 1– <dig>   <dig>   <dig> with lanes 5– <dig>   <dig>  silencing activity appears to be strongest in the middle  <dig> nt of sequence corresponding to fragments 5– <dig> 

we conclude, therefore, that the sequence of exon  <dig> contains splicing silencing activity throughout its length, but that this activity is heterogeneously distributed. there is no evidence of a single super-ess in exon  <dig>  for example centered around the potential high-affinity hnrnp a <dig> sites.

microarchitecture of ess in exon 26
in order to further investigate the distribution of ess in exon  <dig>  overlapping  <dig> nt sequences derived from fragment  <dig> and from fragment  <dig> were tested using the dna ligase iii in vitro splicing system. we selected fragment  <dig> and fragment  <dig> as exemplars of relatively well-spliced and relatively silenced fragments respectively. moreover, as fragment  <dig> contains the rna editing site, we wished to see if silencing activity was related to the rna editing activity.

figure 3a shows the result of testing these constructs, made with sequences derived from fragment  <dig>  at this resolution, there is a heterogeneous distribution of ess activity, with certain sequences such as 65– <dig> showing silencing better than the native ess of dna ligase iii, rep and other sequences such as 113– <dig> showing no significant effects on splicing . identically spliced mrnas appear as different sized bands in the lower parts of figures 3a and 4a. this is likely to represent variable degrees of exonuclease degradation to which mrnas are susceptible in the nuclear extract used for the assay.

figure  <dig> shows the result of testing constructs made with sequences derived from fragment  <dig>  in contrast to the fragment  <dig> sequences, the fragment  <dig> sequences show less heterogeneity with most sequences tested showing ess activity . we conclude, therefore, that exon  <dig> contains multiple ess sequences along its length in a heterogeneous distribution. more frequent silencing activity is seen with the 25-mers derived from fragment  <dig> than fragment  <dig>  consistent with the greater silencing activity of fragment  <dig> compared to fragment  <dig> 

ess identified by the dna ligase iii c-ß reporter also silence the hßΔ <dig> reporter
in order to ensure that the ess activity was not dependent on the splicing reporter, key sequences were also tested in the ß-globin splicing reporter hßΔ <dig>  <cit> . in this different context, the 25-mers 65– <dig> and 2319– <dig> ed were also able to repress hßΔ <dig> splicing by ~50%, whereas the neutral sequence 161– <dig> did not significantly repress splicing .

the sequence requirements of rna editing are distinct from ess activity
rna editing of apob is dependent on an  <dig> nt mooring sequence 3′ to the rna editing site itself, which represents a binding site for the editosome  <cit> . the sequence spanning the rna editing site and mooring sequence  shows ess activity . as rna editing and splicing are linked  <cit>  and as both processes may share common components, such as ksrp  <cit>  and cugbp <dig>  <cit> , we wondered whether the silencing activity of ed might be related to its ability to support rna editing. to this end, several point mutations were constructed in ed, three of which are known to knock out rna editing , one of which is neutral with respect to rna editing , and one of which is intermediate in reducing rna editing activity   <cit> . these constructs were tested for splicing activity . the mutations did not affect the silencing activity of ed, suggesting that the sequence requirements of rna editing are distinct from ess activity and that perhaps different factors are responsible for silencing activity vis-à-vis rna editing.

antisense oligonucleotide blockade of ess causes alternative splicing of apob
to investigate the role of these ess elements in vivo, we turned to 2′-o-methyl antisense oligonucleotides , which can direct alternative splicing by binding to splice sites or regulatory elements  <cit> . these asos were targeted at identified ess, namely elements 66– <dig>  97– <dig>  129– <dig>  2319– <dig> ed . we also made an aso targeted to a neutral region, 193– <dig> , and a negative control aso which did not match any sequences within apob. these asos were transfected into hepg <dig> cells, which synthesize and secrete apob. the splicing of apob exon  <dig> was assessed by rt-pcr  <cit> .

as shown in figure  <dig>  targeting asos individually to each ess did not cause significant alternative splicing . targeting the neutral sequence 193– <dig> did not alter splicing . targeting another neutral sequence 2191– <dig> did not alter splicing . however, when mixtures of asos were combined, especially when ess 66– <dig>  97– <dig> and 129– <dig> were targeted simultaneously, we saw significant alternative splicing of apob to two alternative isoforms : one in which exon  <dig> was skipped to join exons  <dig> and  <dig> together; and one in which a pseudo 3′ splice site  was selected at position  <dig> within exon  <dig> . maximum entropy modelling ranks this pseudo 3′ site as the highest scoring and strongest 3′ site within apob exon  <dig> , in comparison to the native 3′ splice site . this therefore implies that:  these elements have a function in suppressing pseudo splice site selection in vivo; and  that these elements have functional redundancy.

while the splice site strength of this cryptically activated 3′ splice site is higher than the native 3′ splice site it is unclear why a group of ess approximately  <dig>  nt upstream might be involved in repressing this pseudo splice site. we may speculate that disruption of exonic silencers allows more efficient aggregation of splicing factors around cryptic splice sites further downstream, thereby increasing the kinetics of spliceosome assembly and allowing minor isoforms to become apparent. the other possibility is that interference with ess allows silencing protein activity to become more influential at the constitutive 3′ splice site. other methodological explanations include the possibility that pseudo splice sites nearer the ess sites are selected which would give significantly larger products which were not amplified efficiently by the pcr in comparison to the shorter transcripts, or that could not be distinguished from constitutively spliced transcript by gel electrophoresis under the conditions which we used.

computational identification of ess is less specific and sensitive than splicing assays
experimental and computational models, such as fas-ess hexamers and putative ess  octamers as defined by zhang and chasin  <cit> , can be used to predict ess sites in exon  <dig> and which may then be compared with sites identified in our assay. fas-ess hexamers appear to occur along the exon  <dig> sequence , but there does not appear to be any bias towards more frequent appearances within the middle of the exon as noted in our assay. we found that there was a variable correlation of fas-ess hexamers within 25mer ess identified in our assays  but overall these appear to be less sensitive  and less specific  than the in vitro splicing assay. a similar picture was again apparent with the pess matches .

it has also been suggested that the distribution of splicing enhancer sequences can influence the use of genuine splice sites over pseudo splice sites. we therefore searched for ese sequences within exon  <dig>  using tools derived from computational and experimental modeling  <cit>  to see if there might be such a bias in the distribution of ese. however, putative ese were noted all along the length of the exon and do not appear to have a bias for the ends of the exons, in keeping with other similar studies  <cit> , suggesting that ese do not appear to contribute to the selection of genuine splice sites in exon  <dig>  this is further confirmed by the fact that we did not detect any significant enhancement of reporter splicing by the tested sequences.

secondary structure
a prediction of the secondary structure folding of apob exon  <dig> pre-mrna and its flanking introns, utilising the mfold web server  shows that region a <dig>  which has inherently higher silencing activity compared with region a <dig>  is predicted to contain more secondary structure  <cit> . in particular, the ess containing the editing site, targeted by aso , contains a high degree of secondary structure . work by hiller and colleagues  <cit>  suggests that splicing elements are more effective when they are in single-stranded conformations, which does not fit with our observation that the a <dig> region  is predicted to form strong secondary structures, and more so than the a <dig> region which has a lower density of esss. moreover, as the formation of secondary structure by a particular sequence is highly dependent on the context of its neighbouring sequences, it is unclear how the esss, if they are working primarily by means of mechanisms dependent on the formation of secondary structure, could inhibit the splicing of the two different heterologous splicing reporters used here. for these reasons we believe that secondary structure may not be a key influence in pseudo splice site silencing in exon  <dig> 

nonsense-mediated decay
in addition to regulation of splicing, other mechanisms have been proposed to ensure that mature mrnas have been accurately spliced. nonsense-mediated decay  is conceivably a mechanism for suppressing ptc-containing mrnas generated by aberrant splicing to cryptic splice sites, and is in some cases a mechanism for regulation of protein expression  <cit> . however, despite the fact that rna editing generates a ptc in the middle of exon  <dig>  edited apob mrna appears to not be subject to nmd, nor is a ptc-containing apob mrna isoform skipping exon  <dig>  <cit> . in the case of exon  <dig>  the binding of the apobec- <dig> complementation factor , a component of the editosome, is important in protecting the edited rna from nmd  <cit> . further, out of the  <dig> alternative isoforms generated by use of high-scoring pseudo splice sites in exon  <dig>   <dig> are predicted to splice in-frame and do not contain ptcs. therefore, nmd is not a plausible mechanism for policing the selection of splice sites in apob splicing.

CONCLUSIONS
the splicing of rna requires the accurate selection of genuine splice sites over numerous pseudo splice sites, and this is facilitated by additional rna sequence information in the form of splicing enhancers and silencers. accurate splicing of exon  <dig> is necessary to ensure that apob is expressed correctly and assembled into the correct lipoprotein particles.

to our knowledge, this is the first time a partial survey of splicing elements has been carried out in a long exon. in most experimentally characterised cases, ess have been isolated as single elements or sometimes bipartite elements of variable length from  <dig> nt  <cit>  to  <dig> nt  <cit> , usually in the context of alternative splicing. in exon  <dig>  our data demonstrate that there exist multiple, tandem ess, a unique configuration of ess. we show, in vivo, that blocking selected ess with antisense oligonucleotides triggers the selection of the strongest 3′ pseudo splice site within exon  <dig>  i.e. cryptic activation of the pseudo splice site. although constitutive splicing of exon  <dig> at the native splice sites continues to generate the dominant isoform, and the alternative splicing effects are small, we speculate that this may be ascribed to poor access of blocking oligonucleotides to the spliceosome and the fact that we have only targeted a small number of multiply redundant ess. this latter notion is supported by the fact that blockade is only effective with combinations of asos.

we hypothesize that these multiple ess may serve to suppress the pseudo splice sites within it, and we propose that similar mechanisms may govern the accurate splicing of other long exons in the genome.

furthermore, it is possible that polymorphisms within the exon  <dig> sequence, even if translationally silent, may perturb these silencers and disturb splicing of exon  <dig>  leading to subtle alterations of apob expression and function which may underlie inter-individual differences in lipoprotein levels and function  <cit> .
