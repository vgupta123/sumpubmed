BACKGROUND
the barriers that lead to divergence of species during the course of evolution were classified by dobzhansky in two categories: prezygotic and postzygotic reproductive barriers  <cit> . postzygotic reproductive barriers concern all the events that occur after fertilization, such as reduced hybrid viability and fertility, while prezygotic reproductive barriers concern isolation of sexual partners via ecological, temporal or behavioral isolation. pheromones play a key role in pre-mating recognition of sexual partners  <cit> . these compounds are defined as substances released by an animal that are able to induce specific behavioral and/or endocrinological reactions in a sexual partner of the same species  <cit> . through these reactions, they could be involved in mate choice and sexual selection.

odorant binding proteins  are small soluble proteins that are present in the olfactory apparatus as well as in biological fluids such as saliva, urine or vaginal discharge, and are able to bind pheromones . obp are assumed to be directly involved in chemical communication and in the pre-mating recognition process. three hypotheses are proposed concerning their mechanism of action. the first is that olfactory receptors can recognize the obp/pheromone complex, not just the pheromone alone. the second hypothesis is that the pheromone can be transferred to olfactory receptors only if assisted by the obp. the third hypothesis is that the ligand can spontaneously dissociate from the complex with obp and bind to the receptor as a "free pheromone"  <cit> .

the role of saliva in chemical communication between males and females is well established in pig  <cit> , like the role of urine in mouse  <cit> . in pig, saliva contains the pheromonal steroids 5α-androst-16-en-3-one and 5α-androst-16-en-3α-ol, as well as abundant quantities of salivary lipocalin , the most abundant obp isolated from submaxillary glands of mature males. when extracted from its source, this protein is associated with both pheromonal steroids  <cit> , and appears to play a key role in the standing reflex in the sow  <cit>  and also in the boar's libido  <cit> . sal <dig> is also expressed in the nasal and vomeronasal area, but devoid of ligand  <cit> . sal <dig> exhibits a classical structure of lipocalins characterized by a fully conserved n-terminal -g-x-w- motif and the typical folding pattern of a nine-stranded antiparallel β-barrel forming an internal ligand binding site for small hydrophobic molecules  <cit> , despite relatively low sequence similarity  <cit> . sal <dig> also possesses a glycosylation site on asn <dig>  two natural variants have been identified in which in three residues differ . two residues  are located inside the β-barrel while the third residue  is located next to the β-barrel, suggesting that these minor structural differences lead to ligand binding specificities  <cit> .

olfactory receptors are located on the olfactory sensory neurons of the main olfactory system in mammals and on the vomeronasal organ in rodents and other non-primate species  <cit> . several authors examined the evolution of olfactory receptors, but few studies of lipocalins and obp have been performed. ganfornina et al.  <cit>  undertook phylogenetic analysis of prokaryotic and eukaryotic lipocalins and showed that this family appeared early and is composed of  <dig> monophyletic clades. these authors also showed that ancestral lipocalin clades in the phylogenetic tree are able to bind large ligands while more recent lipocalin clades, such as clades composed of obp and mup , bind smaller ligands. they also found that later clades had higher rates of amino acid substitution, more flexible protein structures and greater ligand-binding efficiency than more ancestral lipocalins.

logan et al.  <cit>  undertook an extensive study of the mup cluster in the mouse genome. they identified  <dig> mup genes and  <dig> mup pseudogenes on chromosome  <dig>  they also identified mup gene expansion in rat , in horse  and in mouse lemur  in the same syntenic region. orangutan, chimpanzee, dog, pig , bushbaby and rhesus monkey have only one mup gene in the syntenic region. the inferred phylogeny, the accumulation of synonymous substitutions, and the genomic organization of the mup loci suggest that gene expansion occurred independently in several species  <cit> .

in the light of previous analyses, the aim of the present work was to study the evolution of sal <dig> which is involved in pre-mating recognition in pig. we wanted to determine if selective pressures act on these proteins and to check if positive selection may play a role in binding specificity toward ligands or olfactory receptors.

RESULTS
identification of sal <dig> homologous genes, genomic localization and phylogenetic study
we found similar sequences to pig sal <dig> in  <dig> other mammalian species: cow, horse, dog, guinea pig, rat, mouse, rabbit, macaque, chimpanzee, gorilla, marmoset and elephant . the sequences identified were located at the same syntenic locus between the neighboring genes slc46a <dig> and zfp <dig> and form the sal <dig> family. putative pseudogenes were identified in mouse, rat, mouse lemur, bushbaby and orangutan . the exact number of genes we identified in mouse, rat, chimpanzee, guinea pig, cow, mouse lemur, orangutan and bushbaby differed from that found by logan et al.  <cit> , who failed to identify several of these genes in a previous study, probably due to lower quality genome annotation. mouse and rat genes form two important clusters of duplicates on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, composed of  <dig> genes and  <dig> pseudogenes in mouse, and  <dig> genes and  <dig> pseudogenes in rat. duplicates are present in cow , horse  and guinea pig . all genes of each species form a cluster, suggesting cis-duplication events after speciation. pig, dog, rhesus monkey and chimpanzee possess a single gene similar to sal <dig> in the same syntenic region. in human, the gene is a known pseudogene  <cit>  due to a g-to-a nucleotide substitution at the donor site of the second intron, resulting in the split of the orf of the coding sequences. this substitution was not found in chimpanzee and other primates. in the neandertal genome  <cit> , we found the same genomic organization as in human in ensembl  <cit> , namely the two genes slc46a <dig> and zfp <dig> surrounding a predicted sal <dig> pseudogene. after multiple sequence alignment of this genomic region between chimpanzee, gorilla, neandertal and human, we found the same substitution in the neandertal genome, suggesting the emergence of this mutation in the common ancestor of neandertal and human . the slc46a2/zfp <dig> locus is not present in frog , birds , bony fishes , monotremes  and marsupials , suggesting this family emerged in eutherian mammals. orthology and paralogy relationships between the identified genes were inferred from the phylogenetic tree . monophyletic clades formed by genes belonging to the same species were supported by very high bootstrap values , suggesting that gene duplications occurred independently in mouse, rat, guinea pig, horse, and cow. the relationships between some species were not clear because of low bootstrap values for some nodes , even if rodents and primate clades were supported by high bootstrap values . the percentage of identity between sequences of this family is highly variable, not only between species but also between paralogs. in mouse, for example, mup <dig> and mup <dig> amino acid sequences are strictly identical. in rat, some paralogs are more distinct and pairwise identity ranges from  <dig> to 97%, so we tested paralog datasets for gene conversion events.

evolution of paralogs in the sal <dig> family
gene conversion can occur between paralogous regions if they have sufficient sequence identity. to determine whether the identified clusters of paralogs underwent gene conversion events, we searched for statistical evidence of this phenomenon using the geneconv program  <cit> . the first control analysis of "randomize sites", which randomizes the order of polymorphic sites before analysis, detected no gene conversion event in horse, rat, mouse and guinea pig datasets, implying the results of subsequent geneconv analyses are reliable. as shown in table  <dig>  most of the paralogs of guinea pig and mouse are involved in gene conversion events while in horse and in rat, respectively  <dig> and  <dig> genes out of a total of  <dig> and  <dig> are involved. the length of the converted tract varied greatly among species, from  <dig> bp for the shortest tract in guinea pig, to  <dig> bp for the longest tract in mouse. to determine which type of selective pressure  shaped the evolution of these genes after gene duplication, we assessed selective pressure using the nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution rate ratio  with codon-substitution models, where ω<  <dig> is purifying selection, ω =  <dig> is neutral evolution and ω >  <dig> is consistent with positive darwinian selection  <cit> . we performed a branch-site-based analysis by defining each branch supporting a paralogous gene as a foreground branch for paml. in each species where the sal <dig> gene has been duplicated, only one gene underwent positive selection . significant likelihood ratio tests  were found for the five genes, confirming that a positive selection model fits the data. for cow, mouse and rat genes, only a few  positively selected sites were detected, whereas in horse and particularly in guinea pig, more positively selected sites  were detected.

positively selected sites in the sal <dig> family and putative biological significance
to identify the selective pressure on the sal <dig> family in eutherian mammals, we performed a site-based analysis with paml . after removal of gaps,  <dig> sites were analyzed using the codeml  <cit>  and selecton  <cit>  programs. in both comparisons , lrts were significant  for the dataset. moreover, the aicc score of mec was lower than that of m8a, indicating that mec fits the data better. comparisons of the lrt and aicc scores were significant, implying that selective forces varied among sites between genes. according to m2a and m <dig> models,  <dig> to 29% of sites underwent positive selection, respectively. four sites  were identified as positively selected sites with a p-value of at least 95% by the three models , a strong indication of positive selection for these four amino acids. six sites  were identified by the m2a and m <dig> models. six sites  were identified by m <dig>  and one site  was identified by mec.

to determine if positively selected sites are located in regions of interest, these sites were mapped on the 3d structure of sal <dig>  . to assess the biological significance of these sites, ligand binding sites determined by spinelli et al.  <cit>  were also mapped on the 3d structure. interestingly, three sites under positive selection matched amino acids that are directly involved in androstenol and androstenone binding . side chains of amino acids involved in ligand binding projected into the ligand binding pocket, which is formed by a relatively small internal cavity poorly accessible to solvent, whereas side chains of the majority of positively selected sites projected out of the binding pocket, except for three amino acids, suggesting that positive selection does not only play a role in pheromone binding specificity, but also in interaction with partners such as receptors. relative solvent accessibility  of positively selected sites was determined by asaview and is shown in figure  <dig>  we used the same classification as rost et al.,  <cit> : a residue is classified as buried when the rsa is <9%, as exposed when the rsa is >35%, and as intermediate when the rsa is between  <dig> and 35%. we found three buried sites , six intermediate sites  and seven exposed sites , indicating that most of the positively selected sites are located at the surface of the protein, and are perhaps involved in other functions than pheromone binding, however these remain to be identified. we observed no specific clustering of these sites at the surface of the protein exposed to the solvent .

positive selection events in marmoset, dog, guinea pig, horse and mouse clades
the comparison between site models of paml detects positive selection only if the ω ratio averaged over all branches on the tree is greater than  <dig>  but positive selection can also be expected to affect only a few amino acid residues in certain lineages. for this reason, we used branch-site models  <cit>  that are designed to detect signals of local episodic positive selection in order to determine whether different species underwent selective pressure. we tested the  <dig> species clades as foreground branches with branch-site models of paml. the branches tested are shown in figure  <dig>  we were unable to draw any conclusions concerning cow, gorilla, elephant, macaque, rat and pig clades, as the lrts were not significant. we found significant lrts in the marmoset, dog, guinea pig, horse, mouse and rabbit clades, suggesting that sal <dig> orthologs underwent positive selection in these species, but we were unable to identify any selected sites in rabbit . for the other species, positively selected sites were mapped on the sal <dig> structure. mapping of site 14h identified in dog was not possible because this amino acid is situated at the beginning of the n-terminal end, which was not crystallized. sites identified in marmoset, mouse and dog were not located in the binding pocket of the protein unlike some sites identified in guinea pig and horse. for the two latter clades, one  and two  positively selected sites, respectively, matched pheromone binding sites .

discussion
phylogenomic analyses showed that the sal <dig> family originated in eutherian mammals and that genes belonging to this family were duplicated after speciation events in five mammalian species. in certain living species, such as mouse lemur, bushbaby, orangutan and human, the gene has been lost, as it has in the neanderthal genome. we can date the loss of the gene in hominid before the neandertal-modern human split,  <dig>  to  <dig>  years ago  <cit> . the number of duplication events varies greatly among species. in mouse and rat, massive cis-duplication events have occurred, with respectively  <dig> and  <dig> genes in the cluster, followed by gene loss with respectively  <dig> and  <dig> pseudogenes.

gene duplication represents a source of new genetic material, and can lead to evolutionary novelties. the fate of duplicated genes can follow different models of evolution, with different selective pressures acting on the genes  <cit> . we checked for a change in selective pressure in all paralogs identified in the sal <dig> family and found that only a few paralogs underwent positive selection: one gene in cow, guinea pig, horse, mouse and rat. moreover, few sites of these genes were identified. a large proportion  of each gene evolved under neutrality and only a small proportion  under positive selection. however, among the single genes identified as positively selected in guinea pig and horse, a larger proportion of sites evolved under positive selection  and more sites were identified as being positively selected .

because sequences of some paralogs share high similarity, we searched for gene conversion in our paralogous gene datasets and found extensive interlocus gene conversion events in mouse and guinea pig, and to a lesser extent in horse and rat. karn and laukaitis  <cit>  compared the mouse mup cluster with a gene tree published by mudge et al.  <cit>  and suggested that concerted evolution masked the common origin of the gene and neighboring pseudogenes  <cit> . our results confirmed this hypothesis, indicating extensive gene conversion in the mouse mup cluster. this extensive gene conversion phenomenon led to sequence homogenization and is the cause of the concerted evolution of these genes. such extensive concerted evolution suggests that, at least in mouse and guinea pig, both maintenance of sequence homogeneity and increased gene dosage are important for these species. the evolution of sal <dig> paralogs resembles the evolution of the β-globin gene family. in this family, paralogous copies evolved under a process of functional divergence and there is evidence for two gene conversion events in mouse and goat clusters composed of β-globin duplicated genes there is also evidence for variable selective pressure among sites for β and γ-globin genes with  <dig> to 9% of sites evolving under positive selection  <cit> .

by combining phylogenetic, gene conversion and selective pressure results on paralogs evolution, we can try to describe the fate of duplicated genes, in which duplication can be seen as an advantageous phenomenon for the species concerned, by combining two scenarios from innan and kondrashov  <cit> . in the first scenario, one could consider the massive duplication in rat and mouse as a gene amplification where the increase in dosage of these genes is beneficial. this scenario of evolution corresponds to category iia described by innan and kondrashov  <cit> . in this model, if selection for the duplicated copy is weak, pseudogenization can occur if a null mutation is fixed, which is the case in both mouse and rat. the occurrence of gene conversions that maintain sequence similarity and promote conservation of gene copies could be consistent with that hypothesis, but the high frequency of gene conversion events is not restricted to mouse and rat. in fact, guinea pigs, which do not harbor large gene amplifications, have the highest frequency of conversion events per gene copy among the species tested. the beneficial increase in dosage has already been shown to apply to genes that mediate the interaction between the organism and the environment  <cit> , as is true of genes of the sal <dig> family. however, we also showed that among the many duplicates in rat, mouse and guinea pig, one gene per species is under positive selection so increased gene dosage and gene conversion events are not the only driving force of the evolution of these genes in these species. for these positively selected duplicates, it is the scenario of the category iii  <cit>  which fits, where a new copy can be fixed and preserved by positive selection, leading to the possible emergence of a new function for the positively selected gene.

to study selective pressure in the sal <dig> family in more detail, we tested the amino acids changing occurring in the  <dig> branches supporting species as positively selected by paml. our results showed that marmoset, dog, guinea pig, horse and mouse branches underwent positive selection just after divergence. this evolutionary scenario likely reflects the ability of the sal <dig> family to diverge and to adapt to new behaviour between sexual partners. a previous study on mouse and rat genes identified  <dig> sites as positively selected on rodent co-orthologs of sal <dig>  <cit> . in that study, mouse and rat genes were considered together, whereas in our study, mouse and rat genes were analyzed separately, this explains the difference between the two results. indeed, we only identified one site under positive selection in mouse and no positive selection in rat. the difference between the two results is also due to a difference in the probability threshold chosen to determine whether a site is subject to positive selection or not. in emes et al.  <cit> , a site was said to be positively selected if the probability for one model is >  <dig>  and >  <dig>  for at least one other model. in our study, we chose to consider only sites whose probability was >  <dig>  in order to minimize false positives.

finally, we compared tests of variable selective pressures for the family using several paml codon models. we found evidence for positive selection in a small proportion of sites. because positive selection is known to play a role in the diversification of protein functions, we mapped all positively selected sites on the 3d structure, in order to assess their biological significance for the gene family as a whole and for each species independently. apart from the three amino acids that were under positive selection and involved in ligand binding, the other amino acids identified by site models of paml analyses projected out of the binding pocket. moreover, the majority of these sites were exposed to solvent. if these sites were involved in the interaction with pheromones, they would be found preferentially in the hydrophobic core and would be buried. we thus propose that positive selection plays a role not only in the binding specificity but also in the interaction between the protein and its environment. we were not able to draw any conclusions concerning selective pressures on each site involved in ligand binding, because gaps in the multiple sequence alignment made these calculations impossible. nevertheless, for the  <dig> amino acids involved in pheromone binding, we identified three sites that probably evolved under purifying constraints  and four sites that probably evolved under relaxed constraints . the three sites that evolved under purifying constraints may be essential for protein function, because they were well conserved during the evolution of the family. in rodent populations, emes et al.  <cit>  found that mups, which are co-orthologs of sal <dig>  exhibited amino acids under positive selection, and that these positively selected sites were located at the interface between mups and their receptors, probably v2r receptors on the vomeronasal organ. they also found evidence that olfactory receptors, such as v2rs, underwent positive selection. the hypothesis they proposed is that this adaptation phenomenon is due to conspecific competition, resulting in well adapted pheromones, pheromone binding proteins such as mup, and olfactory receptors  <cit> . our results allow us to extend this hypothesis because positive selection also drives the evolution of pheromone binding proteins in other eutherian mammals. so for all the family, and not just for rodents, there is an adaptive evolution of these proteins to their ligands and maybe their receptors, too. it would be interesting to test if v2r receptors are subject to positive selection, not only in rodents but also in other mammals. several authors reported evidence for positive selection on other or genes in mammals  <cit> , with possible involvement of positively selected sites in the binding property of proteins. moreno-estrada  <cit>  suggested that positive selection could be at the origin of a new ligand binding capability or the modification of odorant perception and could improve the overall degenerated or gene repertoire, at least in human. in insects, co-evolution of the two enzymes involved in the pheromone biosynthetic pathway and in the pheromone receptor has been suggested to play a role in the speciation process  <cit> . it would be interesting to test co-evolution of enzyme/receptor, pheromone/receptor and obp/receptor in mammals.

in mice, mups are important for the delivery, via urine, of chemical signals conveying information about the sex and hormonal status of the animal who release the scent mark  <cit> . in pig, sal <dig> may be involved in pre-mating recognition by binding pig specific sex pheromones in saliva  <cit> . in both species, these proteins are involved in conspecific recognition in the context of reproduction. when the genomes of marine mammals are completed, it will be interesting to search for sal <dig> orthologs. indeed, in such a different environment, chemical communication between sexual partners is probably not mediated by the same olfactory cues as in terrestrial mammals. if a sal <dig> ortholog is found in marine mammal genomes, it will be interesting to discover if it evolved under relaxed constraints or positive selection.

it is well established that reproduction is a very competitive process, and that selective pressures on genes involved in the process are not rare . positive darwinian selection is not atypical, especially for genes involved in sensory perception and mate choice  <cit> . our results demonstrated that  positively selected sites differ between genes and  positively selected sites are involved in ligand binding and are putatively involved in receptor binding. such a selective pressure on these proteins could be at the origin of a divergence process between species and thus contribute to the speciation phenomenon by reinforcing prezygotic barriers. to test this hypothesis, we performed in vitro mutagenesis experiments on sal <dig>  but the poor folding of the resulting proteins prevented further experimentation.

CONCLUSIONS
the sal <dig> gene family originated in eutherian mammals and duplicated after speciation in cow, horse, guinea pig and rodents. some duplicated genes underwent concerted evolution with extensive gene conversion. others were subject to positive selection at different sites, and our knowledge of the 3d structure of this protein suggests that the selected sites are involved in pheromone binding and possibly in olfactory receptor binding. this result suggests a functional divergence between species because positively selected sites differ between species. all these data suggest that the evolution of the sal <dig> family allows a species-specific strategy to transduce pheromonal signals in mammals, reinforcing species divergence through species-specific sexual behaviour.
