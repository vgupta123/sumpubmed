BACKGROUND
yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae is a widely-used protein expression system to produce target proteins of great commercial value  <cit> . such protein products include not only food or food supplements for human and animal consumption, but also varieties of non-food industrial products for the ultimate benefit of mankind.

myostatin , also known as growth and differentiation factor  <dig>  is a member of transforming growth factor -ß superfamily, which has been found to be capable of modulating the body weight and muscle composition in laboratory and farm animals  <cit> . in a recent proof-of-concept study, we demonstrated that oral feeding of heat-killed whole recombinant yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing mammalian myostatin from a plasmid elicited antigen-specific cell and humor responses, which resulted in increased body weight and muscle composition in mice  <cit> . due to its simple growing method and nontoxic nature, it is reasonable to believe that such recombinant yeast can be further developed into edible vaccine, which is useful to improve meat production in farm animals and combat human muscle-wasting diseases such as muscular atrophy.

yeast can be easily transformed with foreign dna, which carries gene expression cassette. however, once in cells, the foreign dna, which is often in a form of episomal plasmid, can be easily lost after a couple of rounds of cell replication unless selection pressure is continuously applied. on the other hand, to maintain the foreign dna in cells expression of antibiotic selection marker and/or addition of antibiotics in culture may not be favorable for the purpose of protein production either for human consumption or for pharmaceutical use. auxotrophic complementary selection markers have certain advantages over antibiotic markers; however, it remains inconvenient and costly to grow a strain with synthetic media by using these markers. to date, chromosomal integration of gene expression cassette in yeast cells offers a better choice to avoid most of the problems mentioned above. chromosomal integration can lead to a stable expression and eliminate the need of selection pressure to maintain an established recombinant yeast strain. here, we presented our results of engineering a yeast strain, which carries chromosomal integration of mammalian myostatin expression cassette, and stably produces myostatin protein shown by western blot. moreover, with the help of the cre-loxp system we removed the selection marker gene which is absolutely nonessential for expression of target proteins.

RESULTS
construction of integration plasmids
the intermediate plasmids pblue-kanmx <dig> and pblue-kanmx4-nts2-5’3’ were constructed as described in materials and methods. meanwhile, we constructed myostatin expression cassette using overlap pcr strategy. to do so, pcr primers were designed to first amplify the promoter region of adh <dig> gene using adh1-f and adh1-r primers from yeast expression vector jmb <dig> , the termination region of cyc <dig> gene using cyc3-f and cyc3-r primers from the same yeast expression vector as for amplification of adh <dig> promoter , the coding region of porcine myostatin cdna using mstn-f and mstn-r primers from jmb88-mstn previously described in our studies  <cit> and . the pcr products of these three regions were  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp, respectively . after gel purification,  <dig> ul each of these three dna fragments mixed with adh1-f and cyc3-r primers were used for overlapping pcr as described in materials and methods. the final pcr product of myostatin expression cassette was about  <dig> bp in length . then, the dna fragment of pcr product was recovered, digested with xhoi and ecori, and subcloned into pblue-kanmx4-nts2-5’3’ on the same restriction sites. the resulting final plasmid was designated as pblue-kanmx4-nts2-5’3’-mstn. the success of subcloning was confirmed by restriction digestion  and by dna sequencing . a schematic illustration map of integration plasmid is given in figure 1d.


chromosomal integration of target plasmid in yeast jmy1to integrate target plasmid into chromosomes of yeast, we followed a standard procedure of homologous dna recombination. in brief, pblue-kanmx4-nts2-5’3’-mstn plasmid was linearized by restriction digestion with kpni. then, dna fragment was gel-purified and used to transform yeast jmy <dig>  transformants were grown on yepd rich medium agar plates containing  <dig> μg/ml of g <dig> at 30°c. three days later, nearly a hundred positive colonies showed up on the plate, and three of them were randomly selected and amplified in fresh yepd liquid media. genomic dna was extracted using the method described by harju et al.  <cit> . it involved repeated freeze-thawing of cells in a lysis buffer to disrupt cell wall and membrane and release their genomic dna. isolated dna was resuspended in te buffer and further diluted to 200ug/ml. one μl of such prepared genomic dna solution was used and subjected to pcr using cyc3-f and nts2-3’-r primers as previously described . since the target plasmid had been linearized prior to transformation, it would not propagate along with cell replication, which rendered negative results for those cells without chromosomal integration. as shown in figure 2a, two of the three colonies gave rise to an 1826-bp pcr product, indicating that the target plasmid had been successfully integrated into the chromosomes of these cells. both colonies were then preserved in glycerol at −80°c, and one of them was designated jmy <dig> and used in further studies.


removal of kanmx <dig> marker gene
regardless its molecular mechanism, retaining a selection marker gene in yeast cells would have potential deleterious effect on the production of target gene product. towards a step further to transform yeast into edible vaccine, we decided to remove the kanmx <dig> selection module after the chromosomal integration of myostatin gene expression cassette was confirmed. a cre gene expression plasmid jmb <dig> was transformed into jmy <dig>  and grew in minimal sd plate depleted of uracil for  <dig> hours. then, four colonies were randomly selected and tested for the removal of kanmx <dig> module by pcr using primers cyc3-f and nts-3’-r . compared to negative control, all four colonies showed a pcr product in the size of  <dig> bp , indicating that kanmx <dig> module was removed. to further confirm removal of kanmx <dig> module, we tested these cells on g <dig> selection media and did not find the cells grew on g <dig> media . these colonies were preserved in glycerol solution at −80°c, and then used in further studies.

expression of myostatin in yeast cells
finally, we examined the expression of recombinant mammalian mstn in newly established yeast strain. all four colonies obtained from last step were grown in  <dig> ml of yepd rich media at 30°c for  <dig> hours. subsequently, yeast whole protein was extracted using liac/naoh extraction methods, which was invented in our lab as previously described  <cit> . western blot was carried out using home-made mouse polyclonal anti-mstn antibody. meanwhile, we used yeast cells expressing mstn from a plasmid with cu2+-inducible promoter as positive control. as shown in figure 3a, a colony that carried chromosomal integration of mstn gene and stably expressed mstn protein had similar expression efficiency as that of inducible promoter. the strain derived from this colony was designated jmy <dig> and used in further studies. all other colonies expressed mstn to similar levels with little differences .


to test the stability of newly established yeast strain jmy <dig> which kept at −80°c for  <dig> years, we first recovered the strain jmy <dig> and cultured the cells in large scale for the strain stability test and oral immunization. after starting immunization experiment, we had maintained the recombinant strain in rich media for  <dig> months and then checked the stability every  <dig> hours for  <dig> days. compared to protein samples previously prepared, our results showed that expression of recombinant mammalian myostatin in jmy <dig> was stable after long period of culture in rich media .

effect of whole recombinant yeast vaccine on the body weight of mice
the vaccination procedure carried out in this study lasted a total of  <dig> weeks, but the mice were maintained for additional  <dig> weeks before they were sacrificed. we first examined the immunization response by detection of anti-mstn antibody in mouse serum. as shown in figure  <dig>  the mice immunized with the yeast strain stably expressing mstn generated specific anti-mstn antibody in their serum, but not detected in control group. we then examined the body weight of each animal both before and after the experiment. as shown in table  <dig>  when the experiment started all mice were about the same size with little difference. at the end of experiment, however, they weighted from  <dig> to  <dig> g and the average sizes varied among groups. in group pbs and group jmy <dig>  the average increase of body weight was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  or  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g, respectively, whereas it was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g in group jmy <dig>  suggesting that vaccination against myostatin modulated the body weight of animals and oral administration of whole recombinant yeast vaccine was effective.

discussion
in this study, we engineered a yeast strain from saccharomyces cerevisiae, which carries chromosomal integration of mammalian myostatin expression cassette and is capable of stably expressing the target protein in rich culture media without the need of maintaining selection pressure. an ideal yeast vaccine candidate should be free of antibiotic selection marker genes and easily for growing in rich media without selection pressure. we constructed such recombinant yeast strain, which could be used for a large scale preparation of edible vaccine for animals based on the functional analysis of mammalian myostatin in our previous report  <cit> .

to ensure the expression of target protein permanently, we chose the non-transcriptional spaces of yeast rrna gene as chromosomal integration sites. alternatively, chromosomal integration might be also achieved by using homologous sequences to yeast chromosomal centromere or telomere regions  <cit> . however, the copy numbers of these integration sites are often limited to one per cell. recent studies have shown that the non-transcribed spacers, nts <dig> and nts <dig>  in the 5’ and 3’ end flanking regions of 5s ribosomal dna, which separate from its upstream and downstream ribosomal rna precursor-encoding genes are the ideal sites for chromosomal integration  <cit> . they are highly conservative and each offers approximately  <dig> copies per cell in yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. the actual copy number of myostatin expression cassette in our yeast can be examined by southern blotting or in situ hybridization, but it was not determined in this study due to the lack of appropriate lab equipments and technique. nonetheless, western blotting analysis provided a satisfactory result when compared to a mstn-plasmid expressing strain, which was previously established and used in our lab . and the new strain could stably express mtsn in rich culture after stored for two years . we confirmed that similar levels of expression of mstn to this yeast were capable of giving rise to significant immune response in mice and subsequently affected their body weight.

the primary purpose of this study was to generate a yeast strain, which stably expresses mammalian myostatin in rich media. during the construction of integration plasmid, we designed the intermediate vector pblue-kanmx4-nts2-5’3’ in such a way that it may serve as a unique chromosomal integration cloning vector for other target proteins. the cloning sites are commonly used restriction enzymes and can be further modified, if necessary, for any cdna subcloning task. thus, this vector should be applicable to most protein expression in yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae and it is available for other researchers on request.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study provides a convenient strategy to establish chromosomal integration of gene expression cassette in yeast cells. the method is simple and easy to perform. it combines previous research by others on chromosomal integration and removal of kanmx <dig> selection cassette by cre-loxp procedure. the target gene was mammalian myostatin whose expression was quite successful and those recombinant yeast cells can induce immune responses to myostatin by oral route, resulting in increasing body weight in mice. it is an important step towards transforming yeast cells into edible vaccine to improve meat production in farm animals and combat muscle-waste genetic diseases in human.
