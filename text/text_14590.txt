BACKGROUND
by providing researchers with a means of genetically encoding fluorescence, fluorescent proteins  have essentially turned mammalian cells into living test tubes for performing many types of biochemical assays. one of the most sophisticated applications of fps is their use in the construction of proteinaceous biosensors for a variety of enzyme activities in live cells  <cit> . a biosensor design strategy that has proven to be particularly robust and versatile is the modulation of förster resonance energy transfer  efficiency between a blue shifted donor fp and a red shifted acceptor fp  <cit> . the key to creation of such biosensors is that a protein containing both a donor and an acceptor fp undergoes an enzyme activity-dependent conformational change such that the distance and/or fluorophore dipole orientation between the fps is modified  <cit> . this change in distance or orientation results in a change in fret efficiency that manifests itself as a change in emission ratio.

although the designs principles of fret-based biosensors are relatively well-established  <cit> , methods for optimizing the signal-to-noise ratio of the fret change are not. the goal of any optimization effort is to maximize the ratio change between the initial and final states of the biosensor by maximizing the change in distance and/or fluorophore dipole orientation  <cit> . although some progress has been made in the computational prediction of fret changes  <cit> , empirical screening remains the most effective method of achieving substantial improvements. previous optimization efforts have involved the tedious and systematic modification of the linkers, topology, and domain identities  <cit> . in one of the single most exhaustive efforts to optimize a fret based biosensor,  <dig> systematically varied linker combinations of a glutamate biosensor were constructed and individually tested in vitro to identify the one with the highest ratio change  <cit> . the position in 'linker space' and the magnitude of ratio change did not follow any predictable trend and only one of the  <dig> linker combinations exhibited a substantial increase in ratio change. clearly, rapid and high-throughput means for optimizing combinations of two or three linkers in fret-based biosensors could accelerate the development of improved tools for both basic biochemical and applied pharmaceutical research.

inspired by the fact that fluorescence screening in bacterial colonies has been the technology of choice for the directed evolution of improved fps, we sought to extend this methodology to the screening of biosensors. however, unlike individual fps that have a static and unchanging fluorescence, biosensors have a dynamic fluorescence emission that must be imaged in both its initial baseline state and its final stimulated state. accordingly, the primary challenge of screening biosensors in bacterial colonies is how to induce the biochemical change , that the biosensor is designed to sense. to address this challenge we have developed a screening system in which the functional response of a fret-based biosensor for a post-translational modification can be artificially induced in live bacterial colonies. we note that an alternative approach to addressing this challenge is to optimize a fret-based biosensor in mammalian cells. in recent work, piljić et al. have used this alternative approach to optimize the fret response of biosensors for detection of the activation of two calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinases  <cit> . the advantage of this approach is that the sensor is optimized for use in the same context in which it will ultimately be applied. a disadvantage is that the throughput of the screening approach is substantially less than what can be achieved using bacterial colonies.

as a model system for demonstrating the utility of screening in bacterial colonies, we have undertaken the optimization of a biosensor for enzymatic trimethylation of lysine  <dig> of histone h <dig>  . a previously reported biosensor of this enzyme activity  <cit> , which was rationally designed based on x-ray crystallographic information  <cit>  and not empirically optimized, had a ratio change of 28%. as a similar biosensor for methylation of lysine  <dig> of histone h <dig>  had a ratio change of 60%  <cit> , it seemed reasonable that further improvements of a h3k27-trimethylation biosensor  could be achieved with linker optimization. another important consideration was the availability of the paramecium bursaria chlorella virus set domain protein  that catalyzes h3k27-trimethylation and can be produced in soluble and active form in e. coli  <cit> .

RESULTS
design and optimization of a colony-based screening system
to achieve the inducible post-translational modification of a h3k27-metbio in e. coli, we designed a dual expression plasmid  that expresses the biosensor construct under control of the tac promoter   <cit>  and vset under control of the arabad promoter   <cit>  . we reasoned that a single-plasmid based approach would simplify the experimental procedures by eliminating the need for multiple transformations and more than one resistance marker. the pbad promoter was chosen because it has been reported to provide tight regulation of gene expression  <cit>  and would allow us to use l-arabinose to selectively "turn on" vset expression in colonies of e. coli that are also expressing the biosensor .

to determine the level of induction that we could achieve for vset under the pbad promoter, in the context of e. coli colonies grown under conditions that would also induce ptac, we used both western blot analysis and fluorescence imaging of bacterial colonies. as shown in figure 3a-d, western blot analysis with an anti-his-tag antibody was used to qualitatively determine the relative abundance of vset  in e. coli grown on media containing various concentrations of d-glucose, iptg, and l-arabinose. as expected, vset expression was very strong under the inducing conditions , but was not detectable under the repressive conditions . spraying of the colonies grown under the repressive conditions with a concentrated solution of l-arabinose  resulted in a substantial increase in the amount of vset over a time period of  <dig> hours , though the protein did not reach the same abundance as in the colonies grown in the presence of l-arabinose . if d-glucose was not included in the growth media, the pbad promoter was not fully repressed as indicated by the detection of vset protein . we noted that colonies grown on media that contains l-arabinose and iptg, but no d-glucose, tended to be relatively small, suggesting an increased metabolic burden on the e. coli  <cit> .

having confirmed that vset expression could be "turned on" in colonies by treating with l-arabinose, we next tested whether we could induce a change in the fret emission signal of a h3k27-metbio expressed in colonies of e. coli. accordingly, we constructed the puade plasmid with vset under the pbad promoter and a first generation h3k27-metbio  under the ptac promoter. in contrast to the previously reported h3k <dig> biosensor  <cit>  which incorporated the cfp-yfp fret pair and the polycomb chromodomain  <cit> , h3k27-metbio <dig> incorporated the mtfp1-mcitrine fret pair  <cit>  and the cbx <dig> chromodomain  <cit>  . cbx <dig> has high homology with polycomb and exhibits a strong preference for binding to trimethylated h3k <dig> over the di-, mono-, and unmethylated forms  <cit> . the choice of the cbx <dig> chromodomain was later revealed to be fortuitous since this binding domain produced the largest fret ratio change of all domains tested. cfp was substituted with mtfp <dig> due to the improved brightness and photostability of the latter protein  <cit> . following our convention for linker length description , l <dig>  l <dig>  and l <dig> of h3k27-metbio <dig> consisted of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> amino acids respectively. the sequences of l <dig> and l <dig> corresponded to the normal c- and n-terminal sequences of the respective fps in addition to the amino acids encoded by the codons of the restriction sites . l <dig> corresponded to a 18-residue unstructured linker  <cit>  flanked by the two amino acids at each end that are encoded by the restriction sites. the complete sequence of h3k27-metbio <dig> and other key variants is provided in figure 4a.

in vitro characterization of h3k27-metbio <dig> revealed that this construct exhibited a 29% change in emission ratio change upon treatment with vset in the presence of s-adenosyl methionine  . to determine if methylation of h3k27-metbio <dig> was also occurring in e. coli under conditions where vset was being expressed, we transformed cells with the puade- plasmid and cultured colonies  on media supplemented with  <dig> mm iptg plus various combinations of l-arabinose and d-glucose. after allowing colonies to grow overnight at 37°c, plates were imaged using a fluorescence imaging system equipped with bandpass filters that allowed us to acquire fluorescence images of the mtfp <dig> donor  and the acceptor fluorescence due to fret   <cit> . processing of the digital images provided the average acceptor to donor  ratios for the colonies. as shown in figure 4c, the fret/mtfp <dig> ratios for colonies grown in the presence of l-arabinose and d-glucose were substantially higher than those grown in the presence of d-glucose alone. this result provided strong support for the conclusion that h3k27-metbio <dig> could be methylated by recombinant vset in the context of e. coli colonies. for all future experiments we used  <dig> mm d-glucose as our repressing condition  and  <dig> mm l-arabinose as our inducing condition . both the glucose and arabinose plates contained  <dig> mm iptg to induce the production of h3k27-metbio. unlike the very slow growing colonies on plates containing only l-arabinose and iptg, colonies grown on media with both l-arabinose and d-glucose grew at a rate that was comparable to colonies grown on media containing only d-glucose. presumably, adding d-glucose decreased vset expression to a level that is less metabolically burdensome.

library screening identifies biosensors with increased fret changes
having established that it was possible to methylate h3k27-metbio <dig> in the context of bacterial colonies and then image the resulting change emission ratio for hundreds of individual colonies on a single plate, we next explored various methods of using this technology for library screening. our goal was to identify the most robust and reliable procedure by which the emission ratio of a single clone could be determined under both inducing and repressing conditions for vset expression. seemingly, the ideal solution would be to image colonies on repressive media, spray with sufficient l-arabinose to induce vset expression, and then image the same plate again. this approach proved challenging to implement due to the difficulty in getting a uniform application of spraying solution. replica plating onto both inducing and repressing media seemed to offer an alternative solution, but ended up presenting new challenges that were ultimately insurmountable for us. specifically, having missing colonies on one replicate was sufficient to make the digital processing steps effectively intractable, as the correlation between identical clones on the two different plates could not be automatically determined in software. we ultimately settled on the very robust, but more labor intensive, approach of manual plate replication by spotting of single colonies in two sets of ordered arrays. this approach achieved the goal of having identical clones cultured under both repressing and inducing conditions, and also greatly simplified the later digital image processing steps. a schematic representation of this library screening protocol is provided in figure  <dig>  digital image processing using custom macros was used to extract the intensity for each colony on both replicate plates in both the donor and acceptor emission channels. using the equation shown in figure  <dig>  the change in emission ratio for the transition from unmethylated to methylated biosensor  was calculated for each colony. colonies exhibiting the highest Δr/r% values were picked and cultured in order to provide plasmid dna for sequencing.

our overall strategy for optimizing the h3k27-metbio involved the construction and subsequent screening of  <dig> iterative libraries; a domain library , a low resolution linker library , and a higher resolution linker library . lib <dig> was kept quite small and consisted of just  <dig> distinct h3k27-metbio1-derived variants, each of which had identical linkers but different binding domains. four of the  <dig> binding domains were wild-type domains: amino acids 56- <dig> of cdy <dig> , accession aad22735; amino acids 77- <dig> of c20orf <dig> , accession np_057520; amino acids 890- <dig> of jmjd2a , accession np_055478; and amino acids 36- <dig> of cbx <dig> , accession edl <dig>  <cit> . the other  <dig> domains were variants of the wild-type domains that had been engineered for altered binding specificities towards trimethylated lysines: cbx <dig> chromodomain a91k; jmjd2a double tudor domain d945k; and jmjd2a double tudor domain d945r. these engineered variants had been discovered by a phage display effort aimed at improving the binding specificity and/or affinity of these domains. as the gains in specificity and affinity were modest despite a substantial investment of effort, we did not further pursue the original goal. however, we did decide to include the best of the engineered variants in lib <dig> in the expectation that they could potentially alter the fret response of the biosensor. full details of the phage display effort is provided in additional file  <dig> 

for library screening, e. coli was transformed with the lib <dig> plasmid library and plated on regular lb/agar media. individual colonies were picked at random and spotted onto both the inducing and repressing media at the same position within a regular grid. approximately  <dig> h later, the colony grids were imaged as described above and colonies that exhibited the highest Δr/r% values  were picked, cultured, and their plasmid dna isolated. dna sequencing revealed that  <dig> contained cbx <dig> and  <dig> contained cbx <dig> a91k. the cbx <dig> domain was not identified in clones that exhibited the lowest Δr/r% values. this strong consensus clearly demonstrated that this screening approach could be used to identify h3k27-metbio variants from colony-based libraries.

having identified the preferred binding domain for h3k27-metbio, our next goal was to find the combination of linkers that provided the optimal fret ratio change. accordingly, we constructed a second library  that was designed to contain  <dig> members that each had one of seven different lengths of l <dig> , eight different lengths of l <dig> , and seven different lengths for l <dig> . all linkers were composed primarily of glycine, alanine and serine, likely rendering them unstructured and highly flexible. by design, lib <dig> was relatively 'coarse' as our primary goal was to reveal the general trends in preferred linker length, such that we could eventually design a more refined second linker library.

to identify the best linker length combinations from lib <dig>  six pairs of 'glucose' and 'arabinose' plates, each with  <dig> re-spotted colonies, were screened as shown in figure  <dig>  the average ratio change for all colonies was determined to be 14% with a standard deviation of 4% . the three colonies which showed the highest fret ratio changes; one which showed the lowest; and other  <dig> clones which showed average values were picked, cultured, and the h3k27-metbio genes were sequenced. sequencing results revealed that colonies which showed the highest ratio changes had l <dig> and l <dig> linker lengths of  <dig>  and l <dig> linker lengths of  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> . the variant with l <dig> =  <dig> residues was designated as h3k27-metbio <dig> .

the results of lib <dig> screening suggested to us that the combination of a short l <dig>  a long l <dig>  and a short l <dig> linker would provide h3k27-metbio variants with the highest fret changes. this observed linker length pattern can be rationalized on the basis of the solution nmr structure of the cbx <dig> chromodomain in complex with a trimethylated h3k27-containing peptide  <cit> . the structure reveals that the n-terminus of cbx <dig>  is in close proximity to the c-terminus of the h3k <dig> peptide . accordingly, we expect that shorter l <dig> and l <dig> linkers, located at the n-terminus of cbx <dig> and the c-terminus of the substrate peptide, respectively, could serve to hold the mtfp1-mcitrine fret pair in closer proximity in the compacted  state of the biosensor and provide higher fret efficiency than longer linkers would. in the extended  state of the biosensor, a longer l <dig> linker could serve to increase the overall distance between the fps and provide a lower fret efficiency than shorter linkers would. so overall, the observed linker combination is a reasonable solution to providing the maximal change in fret efficiency upon methylation of h3k27-metbio.

guided by the results of the lib <dig> library screening, we attempted to further refine the h3k27-metbio linkers by construction and screening of a second linker library designated lib <dig>  the lib <dig> library consisted of  <dig> variants arising from the possible combination of ten l <dig> linkers , eight l <dig> linkers , and eight l <dig> linkers . negative linkers indicate truncations relative to either gly <dig> of mtfp <dig> in the case of l <dig> or relative to glu <dig> of mcitrine in the case of l <dig> 

for screening of lib <dig>  twelve pairs of 'glucose' and 'arabinose' plates were prepared, and the fret ratio changes of the colonies were calculated. the average ratio change was found to be 38% with a standard deviation of 16% . nine clones exhibiting high ratio changes , and twenty-two with average-to-low ratio changes  were picked for clonal expansion and further characterization. sequencing results revealed that the l <dig> linker length in the high ratio change variants ranged from - <dig> to + <dig>  indicating that there was no strong preference for any particular linker length within this range . in contrast,  <dig> of  <dig> high ratio change variants had an l <dig> of - <dig>  indicating that there is a much stronger dependence on this particular linker for achieving high ratio change. similarly,  <dig> of the  <dig> clones with the highest ratio changes had l <dig> of  <dig> residues or longer. the variant with l <dig> = - <dig>  l <dig> =  <dig>  and l <dig> = - <dig> residues was designated as h3k27-metbio <dig> .

the best two variants identified from lib <dig> and lib <dig>  h3k27-metbio <dig> and h3k27-metbio <dig>  respectively, were purified in their unmodified states and a portion of the protein was subjected to an in vitro methylation assay. fluorescence emission scans were acquired using an excitation wavelength of  <dig> nm  and Δr/r% was calculated for each biosensor. h3k27-metbio <dig> demonstrated only a modest improvement in signal change  relative to the h3k27-metbio <dig> . however, h3k27-metbio <dig> exhibited a substantially improved Δr/r% of 66%, which is  <dig>  × higher than h3k27-metbio <dig>  all  <dig> sensors were methylated by vset at similar rates .

imaging of chromatin-targeted h3k27-metbio3
to investigate whether h3k27-metbio <dig> could potentially be used to report on h3k <dig> trimethylation in the context of chromatin in living cells, we constructed a mammalian expression vector encoding a fusion of a histone 2b  and h3k27-metbio <dig>  mouse embryonic fibroblast 3t <dig> cells transfected with this expression vector were viable and observed to proceed through mitosis. ratiometric imaging of transfected cells revealed a speckle-like pattern of high fret regions within the interphase chromatin  that is qualitatively similar to the pattern reported for immunofluorescence imaging with anti-h3k <dig> antibodies  <cit> . further validation, potentially including immunostaining of transfected cells followed by imaging of colocalization with an antibody specific for trimethylated h3k <dig>  will be required to confirm that the regions of high fret do correspond with regions of high h3k <dig> trimethylation. one confounding factor could be local differences in h2b abundance that cause increased or decreased amounts of intermolecular fret.

prospects for the dual expression library screening strategy
with the successful identification of linker combinations that provide improved ratio changes, we have demonstrated that this dual expression library screening strategy, in its current form, is of practical utility for optimizing fret-based biosensors designed to respond to post-translational modification. we expect that this system could be used to optimize a wide variety of biosensors for post-translation modification, provided that the a constitutively active enzyme with the activity of interest can be expressed in its functional form in e. coli. however, the current implementation of the screening system does have some drawbacks that will hopefully be addressed in future versions. one drawback of the current implementation is that, while the colony-based screen did allow us to identify a population of the best variants from a large library, it was not sufficient for identifying the single best variant. accordingly, a secondary in vitro test was required for identification of the variants with the highest fret changes. a second drawback was our reliance on manual spotting for the replication of bacterial colonies, which severely limited the throughput of the assay and increased the likelihood of human error. an improved method for library screening would involve the on-plate induction of enzyme expression. with this approach, images of the same plate, before and after enzyme induction, could be acquired and processed to identify the colonies with the largest changes in emission ratio. our own efforts to achieve on-plate induction using the pbad promoter and application of l-arabinose by spraying did not provide satisfactory results due to the heterogeneity of the application. we expect that this limitation could be overcome through the use of a promoter that could be induced at the same level across the whole plate. one potential solution is to use a cold-inducible promoter  <cit> , which could presumably be induced at the same level in all colonies by simply changing the incubation conditions of the plate. however, it is unclear whether an alternate promoter could provide an equivalent level of repression to pbad in the uninduced state.

with improvements in this library screening strategy, it should be possible to substantially increase the screening throughput. in the current implementation, we were limited to screening hundreds of variants and thus our screen is not exhaustive and has not necessarily yielded the optimal linker combination. in addition, we only investigated the effect of linker length on ratio change and did not attempt to adjust linker composition. we strongly suspect that further improvements in ratio change could be achieved by screening of larger number of variants and exploring both altered linker lengths and compositions  <cit> . we also suspect that biosensors with further improved ratio changes could be identified by altering the orientation of the donor and acceptor fps by employing circularly permuted variants  <cit>  or using 'sticky' fp variants  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed a method for high-throughput screening of biosensor libraries with many hundreds of different linker combinations. this approach should be applicable to the optimization of any genetically encoded biosensor for post-translational modification, provided the gene encoding the enzyme activity of interested can be functionally expressed in e. coli. we have demonstrated this technology by undertaking the optimization of a biosensor for detection of methylation of h3k <dig>  furthermore, we have shown that mammalian cells expressing this biosensor as a histone fusion are viable. accordingly, we anticipate that h3k27-metbio <dig> may facilitate future efforts to spatially resolve h3k27-trimethylation patterns in living cells. furthermore, when compared to existing in vitro assays for histone methyltransferase activity  <cit> , this homogenous biosensor-based assay is notable for requiring the least number of reagents and liquid handling steps. accordingly, h3k27-metbio <dig> may be particularly useful in automated high-throughput screening efforts aimed at the identification of h3k <dig> methyltransferase inhibitors that could serve as chemical probes  <cit>  or as leads for the development of new cancer therapies  <cit> .
