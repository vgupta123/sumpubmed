BACKGROUND
activated macrophages are known to play an important role in the degradation process of normal and abnormal matrix. upon differentiation, the response of macrophages to pathogens is markedly enhanced, allowing them to participate in the inflammatory and immune responses  <cit> . the differentiation process is a complex one and is controlled by the expression or the activation of several factors  <cit> . the activated inflammatory macrophage plays a crucial role in matrix destruction by producing matrix metalloproteinases  both directly and indirectly  <cit> . activated macrophages up-regulate the activity of mmps, particularly that of mmp- <dig>  mmp- <dig> , mmp- <dig>  and mmp- <dig>   <cit> . activated macrophages are also known to release collagenases  under certain circumstances  <cit> . in co-culture assays, macrophages can stimulate myofibroblasts to release collagenases. in the studies of kidney disease, inflammatory macrophages of the glomeruli are found to have induced myofibroblast mesangial cells to produce stromelysin   <cit> .

mmps are a family of structurally related endopeptidases that resorb macromolecules of the extracellular matrix. they participate both in physiologic connective tissue remodeling and in pathologic tissue destruction. however, the exact mechanism underlying the up-regulated expression of mmps in macrophages is not yet clear.

cd <dig>  a 57-kd transmembrane glycoprotein,  and leukocyte activation-associated m <dig> antigen) is located on the surface of human tumor cells and normal keratinocytes  <cit> . cd <dig>  rich on the surface of most tumor cells, has been found to stimulate tumor cells and stromal cells to produce elevated levels of mmps  <cit> . however, the involvement of cd <dig> in stimulating mmp release and activation during cellular maturation process remains unknown. this paper reports our study, using a phorbol myristate acetate -induced cell differentiation model of the human monocytic cell line thp- <dig>  <cit> , on the involvement of cd <dig> expression in the differentiation process of monocytes into macrophages, and on the correlation between cd <dig> expression and the secretion and activation of mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig>  and the correlation between cd <dig> expression and the invasive ability of mono-macrophage cells.

RESULTS
alteration of morphology and phenotype on pma-treatmented thp- <dig> cells
untreated thp- <dig> cells are round in shape and do not adhere to the plastic surfaces of the culture plates. in the presence of  <dig> nm pma for  <dig> h, the cells became flat and amoeboid in shape, and adhered to the dish bottom. flow cytometry analysis revealed that these cells expressed higher levels of cd <dig> , a macrophage-specific differentiation antigen, than those  of the untreated thp- <dig> cells  . the mean fluorescence intensity  of cd <dig> in the differentiated thp- <dig> cells  was higher than that of the undifferentiated thp- <dig> cells   .

mmps release, activation and invasive ability of differentiated thp- <dig> cells
as shown in figure  <dig>  sds-polyacrylamide gelatin electrophoresis zymography showed that the secretion and activation of mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> were significantly enhanced in differentiated thp- <dig> cells compared with those observed in the undifferentiated thp- <dig> cells . rt-pcr showed that mmp- <dig> mrna significantly increased after a 24-hour pma treatment . as shown in figure  <dig>  a significantly increase was observed by elisa in the release of mmp- <dig> in the differentiated thp- <dig> cells compared with that in the undifferentiated thp- <dig> cells. the differentiated thp- <dig> cells, after a 24-hour pma treatment, were found to have significantly higher number of cells/filter to invade through transwell chambers  than that  of undifferentiated thp- <dig> cells  .

effect of hab18g/cd <dig> antagonistic peptide ap- <dig> on mmps release and activation and invasion processes
a significantly reduced release and activation of mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> from cells pre-incubated with hab18g/cd <dig> antigonistic peptide ap- <dig> were found by gelatin zymography. the inhibitory rate of the secretion of prommp- <dig> in the undifferentiated thp- <dig> cells was  <dig> %. the inhibitory rate of the secretion of prommp- <dig>  the activated mmp- <dig> and prommp- <dig> in differentiated thp- <dig> cells was  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively  .

invasion assay showed that the amounts of cells invaded through matrigel coated filter decreased after the treatment with ap- <dig>  for  <dig> h in both undifferentiated and differentiated thp- <dig> cells. the inhibitory rate of invasive potential in the undifferentiated cells and the differentiated thp- <dig> cells was  <dig>  % and  <dig> %, respectively  , control peptide ssp was not inhibitory.

discussion
in this study we demonstrate that the overexpression of cd <dig> enhances the release and the activation of mmps  and the invasive potential during the differentiation of monocyte thp- <dig> cells to macrophage cells. this is in accordance with our previous study in human hepatoma cells  <cit> .

mmps are a family of zn2+-containing enzymes that cleave most of the components of extracellular matrix  and are involved in physiologic connective tissue remodeling and in pathologic tissue destruction. mmps can be regulated by different factors. popp et al reported that calpain/calpastatin system mediated mmp-mrna expression of the leukemic thp- <dig> cells and, as a result, their invasiveness  <cit> . worley et al identified that pparÎ³ and rxr agonists had complex effects on monocyte mmps expression  <cit> . in our present study, we employed cd <dig> to promote mmps.

cd <dig> is a highly glycosylated transmembrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily with two ig domains. previous studies have clearly demonstrated that cd <dig> is highly expressed on some tumor cells and is responsible for stimulating mmp production by stromal cells and/or other tumor cells, thereby leading to extracellular matrix degradation and elevated tumor growth and metastasis  <cit> . cd <dig> has also been found to stimulate the secretion and the activation of mmps, which are associated with tissue degradation and remodeling during inflammatory damage and wound healing. the up-regulation of the expression of cd <dig> in the synovial membrane of rheumatoid arthritis  patients has been reported  <cit> . our recent studies have demonstrated that cd <dig> is highly expressed on monocytes in circulating blood and synovial fluid, and on macrophages/macrophages-like synovial cells in synovium from ra patients  <cit> . similarly, the up-regulation of the expression of cd <dig> on monocytes/macrophages may induce mmps produced by fibroblasts and other monocytes/macrophages, and this process may play an essential role in articular cartilage lesion development in ra.

to explore the association of cd <dig> with the secretion and activation of mmps, especially those in the cellular maturation, in our present study, human thp- <dig> monocytic cells were further stimulated to differentiate into a macrophage-like stage and some specific morphological and phenotypic alterations of pma-treated thp- <dig> cells were detected. the high expression level of cd <dig> was observed in the differentiated process. zymography, rt-pcr and elisa results showed that the secretion and activation of mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> were significantly enhanced in the differentiated thp- <dig> cells. mmp- <dig> mrna expression significantly increased in the differentiated thp- <dig> cells. our results agree with the reports that the stimulation of the cells by pma significantly augmented the release of mmp- <dig>  <cit> .

in view of the fact that cd <dig> may be required for the expression of gelatinases mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> and that the gelatinases mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> are expressed in leukemic cells  <cit> , our study focused on the potential interaction between cd <dig> and mmps, mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig>  in the differentiation process of monocytes into macrophages and in the invasion of monocytes/macrophages. we found that the overexpression of cd <dig> induced elevated levels of prommp- <dig>  pro-mmp- <dig> and their activated forms in differentiated thp- <dig> cells and the elevated levels of mmps in turn enhanced the invasive ability of thp- <dig> cells. but the elevated expression and activation of mmps and the enhanced invasive ability of thp- <dig> cells were blocked when hab18g/cd <dig> antigonistic peptide ap- <dig> was added. these findings indicate that cd <dig> is involved in promoting the expression and activation of mmps, which in turn increases the invasive potential of thp- <dig> cells.

CONCLUSIONS
the results suggest that the expression of cd <dig> is upregulated during the differentiation of monocyte thp- <dig> cells to macrophage cells, and cd <dig> induces the secretion and the activation of mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> and which in turn enhance the invasive ability of thp- <dig> cells. the increased secretion and the activation of mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> and the enhanced invasive ability of thp- <dig> cells can be blocked by antagonistic peptide of cd <dig>  the matured monocytes / macrophages, via their high expression of cd <dig>  may play an important role in promoting the tissue repair or tissue damage during their inflammatory response. these findings, together with a better understanding of the possible mechanism and regulation of cd <dig> on mmps production, will help the development of innovative therapeutic intervention for inflammatory diseases.
