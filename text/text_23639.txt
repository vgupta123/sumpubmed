BACKGROUND
zymomonas mobilis is a gram-negative facultative anaerobic bacterium, which has attracted significant interest over recent years for its use in the industrial-scale production of ‘bioethanol’  <cit> . this microorganism is able to ferment glucose, fructose or sucrose to ethanol, with extremely high molecular efficiencies and minimum accompanying levels of biomass formation. as a ‘generally regarded as safe’  microorganism, z. mobilis has also been used for a variety of other biotechnological purposes, such as the production of levan   <cit>  or amino acids  <cit> . over the past 20 years or so, significant effort has been spent on genetically ‘engineering’ its metabolic capabilities and physiological activities. these have largely focused on extending its limited substrate range, enabling it to utilize carbohydrates that are abundant in lignocellulosic feedstocks  <cit> . genetic engineering applications in z. mobilis have commonly utilized plasmid vectors housing heterologous genes encoding proteins with the desired functionalities  <cit> .

cloning vectors that are routinely used in escherichia coli, such as those derived from pbr <dig> or puc <dig>  cannot be stably-maintained in z. mobilis <cit> . on the other hand, several types of bacterial broad-host range plasmids are able to replicate in z. mobilis cells , and have been used for a variety of heterologous gene expression applications. however, they are prone to structural  instability, and their relatively large size constrains gene cloning strategies  <cit> . consequently, the most common approach for heterologous gene expression in z. mobilis has involved e. coli – z. mobilis shuttle vectors; which incorporate replicons from e. coli plasmids, as well as those from native plasmids isolated from various z. mobilis strains  <cit> .

four native plasmids from z. mobilis atcc  <dig> have been used as the basis for the construction of shuttle vectors: pzmo <dig>   <cit> , pzmo <dig>   <cit> , pzm <dig>   <cit>  and pzm <dig>   <cit> . shuttle vectors have also been constructed from native plasmids isolated from other z. mobilis strains, such as pnsw <dig> from the zm <dig> strain  <cit> ; pzmpi from the z. mobilis prom al strain  <cit>  and pza <dig> from the ncimb  <dig> strain  <cit> . of these, the pzm <dig>  plasmid has been used most extensively for the construction of expression plasmids for physiological investigations or industrial applications in z. mobilis, e.g.  <cit> . most notably, the pzm2-derived pzb <dig> plasmid, which houses four genes involved in pentose sugar metabolism, was used to broaden the substrate range of the cp <dig> strain, enabling it to utilize xylose for the bioproduction of ethanol  <cit> . plasmids derived from pzm <dig> have also been used to express green fluorescent protein reporters  <cit> ; to produce proteins of biotechnological interest such as the inaz ice-nucleation protein  <cit> ; to express fungal carotenoid biosynthetic proteins to direct the production of beta-carotene  <cit> ; and to produce and secrete cellulolytic enzymes to facilitate the utilization of lignocellulosic biomass  <cit> .

in microbial cells, proteins often function within hetero-multimeric complexes, or have activities that are directly modulated by protein-protein interactions  <cit> . approaches involving various combinations of affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry have previously been employed to establish large-scale protein interaction networks, known as ‘interactomes’, within prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms  <cit> . however, to the best of our knowledge, protein-protein interaction analyses have never been performed in z. mobilis or a related alphaproteobacterial species.

the genome sequence for z. mobilis ncimb  <dig> was recently published  <cit> . this included the sequences of three endogenous plasmids: p11163_ <dig> , p11163_ <dig>  and p11163_ <dig> . this was consistent with results from our own z. mobilis plasmid sequencing efforts, in which we had determined the sequences of the two smallest plasmids from ncimb 11163: pzmo1a  and pzmo <dig>    <cit> . the sequences of pzmo <dig> and p11163_ <dig>  are identical, and they correspond to the same plasmid. due to its relatively small size and genetic composition , we hypothesized that pzmo <dig> may be suitable for shuttle vector development.

the aim of this study was to develop an escherichia coli-z. mobilis shuttle-vector system based on pzmo <dig>  and determine its potential for heterologous protein expression and proteomic applications within z. mobilis. to achieve this, we constructed a shuttle vector backbone  that contained a ca.  <dig>  bp replicon fragment from pzmo <dig>  we determined the stability and copy number of pz7c within three different z. mobilis strain lineages: ncimb 11163; cu <dig> rif <dig>  <cit> ; and the atcc  <dig> centrotype strain  <cit> ; under selective and non-selective conditions. as a proof of principle, we expressed a variety of glutathione s-transferase -fusion proteins from pz7c-derived shuttle vectors established in z. mobilis atcc  <dig>  and analyzed their intracellular protein-protein binding interactions. our results demonstrate the utility of pzmo7-derived shuttle vectors for biological applications in z. mobilis.

methods
bacterial strains and culture conditions
bacterial strains are listed in table  <dig>  unless otherwise stated, liquid cultures of z. mobilis cells were grown semi-aerobically in rich medium   <cit>  without agitation at 30°c; in falcon tubes , or duran laboratory glass bottles , with caps that were fitted, but not air-tight; to allow limited gaseous exchange. optical density measurements at 600 nm  were determined using a beckman du  <dig> life science uv/vis spectrophotometer . e. coli strains were grown aerobically in luria broth  at 37°c. for agar plate preparation,  <dig> % w/v agar was added. plates were incubated aerobically at 30°c for z. mobilis strains, or 37°c for e. coli strains. antibiotics were used at the following concentrations: 100 μg/ml chloramphenicol  for z. mobilis; 100 μg/ml ampicillin , 30 μg/ml cm and 10 μg/ml tetracycline  for e. coli.

dna amplification and manipulations
plasmid dna was recovered from e. coli dh10b or z. mobilis cultures using qiaprep spin miniprep kits . the sequences of all primers are shown in additional file  <dig>  pcr products were purified using qiaquick pcr purification kits  or gel-purified using qiaquick gel extraction kits  following the manufacturers’ protocols. all cloned pcr-amplified inserts and junctions between ligated dna fragments were sequenced bidirectionally to confirm the integrity of all plasmid constructs .

transformation of dna into z. mobilis cells
plasmid dna  was transformed into z. mobilis competent cells  as previously described by liang et al.  <cit> ; using a biorad micropulser  with 1 mm gap electroporation cuvettes . transformed cells were recovered in rm medium , incubating semi-aerobically at 30°c for 2-3 hours, before plating onto rm agar containing 100 μg/ml cm for clone selection.

construction of z. mobilis ncimb  <dig> native plasmid library
a chloramphenicol resistance  cassette was pcr amplified from plasmid plyss  using the cm-f and cm-r primers, digested with ecorv and then blunt-end ligated to sspi-digested puc <dig> plasmid  to produce cm-puc <dig>  thereby inactivating the bla  gene. purified z. mobilis ncimb  <dig> endogenous plasmid dna was digested with hindiii , usa), purified , ligated into hindiii-linearized cm-puc <dig> , and electroporated into e. coli dh10b . colonies were screened for presence of an intact cmr cassette by streaking onto lb + cm plates, using lb + amp for negative selection. plasmid dna was purified from cm-resistant transformant colonies, whose inserts were sequenced bidirectionally using m <dig> primers, followed by a ‘primer walking’ approach, giving 2- <dig> times sequence coverage. plasmids puczm- <dig> and puczm- <dig> from this library respectively contained the entire pzmo1a and pzmo <dig> plasmids in a hindiii-linearized form .

construction of pzmo7-derived expression vectors
the  <dig>  bp hindiii/bamhi fragment from puczm- <dig> was ligated into plasmid pacyc- <dig>  forming the plasmid pz7- <dig> . plasmid puczm- <dig> was digested with bamhi, and the resultant  <dig>  bp fragment was purified and self-ligated to form plasmid pz7c. the fragment containing the ptac promoter, glutathione s-transferase  gene, multiple cloning site and downstream terminator  sequence  was pcr amplified from plasmid pgex4t <dig>  using the ptac-f and ttac-r primers, digested with bglii and inserted into the bamhi site of pz7c plasmid to produce pz7-gst . the acyl-carrier protein ; chaperone protein dnaj , rna chaperone protein hfq , dna polymerase iii chi subunit  and 2-dehydro-3-deoxyphosphooctonate aldolase protein  genes were pcr amplified from z. mobilis atcc  <dig>  the genes were respectively cloned into pz7-gst via bamhi/xhoi to form the pz7-gst-acpp, pz7-gst-dnaj, pz7-gst-hfq, pz7-gst-holc and pz7-gst-kdsa plasmids, respectively. all plasmid constructs were verified by sequence analysis.

determination of plasmid stability in z. mobilis
plasmid stability was determined following the method described by conway et al.  <cit> . cultures of freshly-transformed z. mobilis cells  were incubated in rm media containing 100 μg/ml cm  without agitation at 30°c for ca. 24 hours. aliquots  were expanded 1: <dig> into fresh rm media lacking cm , and were cultured at 30°c for 24 hours without agitation. this iterative sub-culturing process was repeated every 24 hours, for  <dig> consecutive days. aliquots were withdrawn daily for: 1) plasmid isolation and analysis by agarose gel electrophoresis ; 2) quantitative pcr analysis .

determination of relative amounts of pzmo1a and pzmo <dig> plasmids using a gel-based approach
‘stabs’ from single colonies of freshly-plated z. mobilis ncimb  <dig> with minimal passage were grown semi-aerobically without agitation in rm media  at 30°c for ca. 24 hours until od600nmca.  <dig> . plasmid dna was extracted , and an aliquot was digested  to linearize the pzmo1a and pzmo <dig> plasmids present. aliquots of undigested and hindiii-digested plasmid dna were analyzed on  <dig> % agarose/tae gels using ethidium bromide staining on a bio-rad chemidoc xrs instrument . band intensities on negative scanned gel images were quantified using quantity one software  to determine the relative proportions of pzmo1a and pzmo <dig> plasmids present.

extraction of plasmid and chromosomal dna for quantitative real time pcr analysis
the cell lysis and crude dna extraction procedure used was based on the method described by skulj et al. <cit> . freshly-inoculated cultures of recombinant or wild type z. mobilis strains were incubated semi-aerobically without agitation at 30°c to od600nm of ca.  <dig>  in rm media  with/without 100 μl/ml chloramphenicol . after centrifugation , cell pellets were washed with ice cold eb buffer , then resuspended in eb buffer , heated in boiling water for  <dig> mins, before allowing to cool gradually to room temperature. the supernatant obtained after centrifugation  was used directly as template for quantitative  pcr analyses.

quantitative real time pcr analysis
plasmid copy numbers were determined by quantitative real time pcr  using a relative quantification approach, based on the procedure described by skulj et al. <cit> . qpcr was performed in 20 μl reaction mixtures in microamp optical 48-well reaction plates, using the fast sybr green pcr master mix reagent  on a steponeplus real-time pcr system  controlled by stepone software version  <dig>  . primers were designed using primer express software version  <dig>  . plasmid dna concentrations were determined using a nanodrop  <dig> spectrophotometer . serial dilutions of the puczm- <dig> and puczm- <dig> plasmids were used to create standard curves for quantifying pzmo1a and pzmo <dig> plasmid concentrations. a pcr <dig>  topo vector containing the pcr-amplified polyphosphate kinase  <dig>  gene from z. mobilis atcc  <dig>  was similarly used to construct a standard curve for z. mobilis chromosome copy number determination. concentrations of chromosome molecules, native plasmids and recombinant plasmids were individually quantified by qpcr within aliquots from the same freshly-prepared cell lysate supernatants prepared from wild-type or transformed z. mobilis strain cultures . the  plasmid copy numbers  in each sample were calculated by dividing the concentration of the respective plasmid molecules by the concentration of chromosome molecules. all qpcr experiments were performed in duplicate, with at least two independent biological replicates.

analysis of pz7c plasmid-based glutathione s-transferase  and gst fusion protein expression in e. coli and z. mobilis
freshly-transformed starter cultures of recombinant e. coli bl <dig>  strains containing the pz7-gst, pz7-gst-acpp, pz7-gst-dnaj, pz7-gst-hfq, pz7-gst-holc or pz7-gst-kdsa plasmids in lb media containing 30 μg/ml cm were expanded 1: <dig> into fresh lb containing 30 μg/ml cm  and grown aerobically with shaking  until od600nm of ca.  <dig> . cultures were chilled in ice-water, and cell pellets were collected by centrifugation , washed with 10% aqueous glycerol, then resuspended in 20 ml ice-cold binding buffer . cells were lysed by sonication with ice-cooling . after centrifugation , the supernatant was filtered , and loaded onto a 1 ml glutathione sepharose gstrap ff column  at  <dig>  ml/min, with ice cooling. after washing with five column volumes of ice-cold binding buffer, proteins were eluted with 5 ml binding buffer containing 10 mm reduced glutathione , collecting  <dig>  ml fractions. protein fractions were analyzed on 12%, 15% or 20% sds-page gels, using colloidal coomassie brilliant blue g- <dig> staining .

analogous procedures were used for recombinant z. mobilis atcc  <dig> and cu <dig> rif <dig> strains, except that cultures  were grown in rm media containing 100 μg/ml cm at 30°c to an od600nm of ca.  <dig> - <dig> . cell cultures were incubated semi-aerobically or anaerobically  in an anaerobic chamber , using a gas mixture of 85% nitrogen, 10% carbon dioxide and 5% hydrogen; as indicated in the text. cultures of wild type z. mobilis atcc  <dig> or cu <dig> rif <dig> were analogously used as negative controls. the mass of pelleted cells obtained from 800 ml cultures was routinely ca.  <dig> -3 g. respective pz7-gst plasmid-based protein expression levels were estimated by comparing band intensities on sds-page gels with those of a dilution series of purified recombinant gst protein of known concentration. individual protein bands were carefully excised using a sterile scalpel, and were analyzed by a combination of mass spectrometric methods: peptide mass fingerprinting  of tryptic fragments, and lc-ms/ms analysis and peptide sequencing .

analysis of pz7c plasmid-based gst fusion protein expression by western blotting
after resolution on 12% sds-polyacrylamide gels, proteins present in the fractions eluted from gst-affinity columns were wet-transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride  membranes using transfer buffer . membranes were blocked using blocking buffer  for 1 hour at room temperature. membranes were incubated with anti-gst primary antibody  in blocking buffer  for 12 hours at 4°c. after washing three times with tbst, membranes were incubated with secondary antibody  in blocking buffer  for 2 hours at room temperature; before being washed three times in tbst. the membrane blots were visualized chemiluminescently using supersignal west pico chemiluminescent substrate , capturing images using a bio-rad chemidoc xrs instrument .

the plasmid sequences pzmo1a and pzmo <dig> were deposited to the ncbi genbank database with the accession numbers nc_ <dig> and nc_ <dig>  respectively.

RESULTS
native plasmids in z. mobilis ncimb 11163
the ncimb  <dig> strain of z. mobilis contains two relatively small native plasmids: pzmo1a  and pzmo <dig>  . plasmid pzmo1a has a g + c content of ca.  <dig> % and shares  <dig> % nucleotide identity  with plasmid pzmo <dig>  from z. mobilis atcc  <dig>  <cit> . as noted above, plasmid pzmo <dig> corresponds to plasmid p11163_ <dig> , which was reported by kouvelis et al. during their sequencing of the ncimb  <dig> genome  <cit> . taken together, data indicates that the ncimb  <dig> strain contains four native plasmids.

sequence analysis of pzmo <dig> 
plasmid pzmo <dig> has two predicted coding dna sequences : pzmo7_ <dig>  and pzmo7_ <dig> . the pzmo7_ <dig> cds encodes a  <dig> aa replication initiation protein  , which belongs to the rep_ <dig> superfamily . the pzmo7_ <dig> cds encodes a 483aa mobilase/replicase protein  , which belongs to the relaxase/mobilisation nuclease domain family .

the region between the mob and rep genes on pzmo <dig>  contains the predicted plasmid replication origin . as may be seen in figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  the rep  and mob  genes are orientated in the same direction. putative promoter start sites predicted using a neural network promoter prediction  programme  <cit>  suggest that the transcription of both the rep and downstream mob genes are driven by a single promoter. regions putatively involved in transcriptional and translational regulation are highlighted in additional file  <dig> 

construction of e. coli - z. mobilis shuttle vectors derived from pzmo7
previous reports have indicated that plasmids must encode both a replication origin and partnering replicase protein for stable, independent replication in z. mobilis cells  <cit> . the hindiii/bamhi fragment of pzmo <dig>  contains the 3’-end of the mob gene, the predicted plasmid replication origin and the entire rep gene along with a ca. 200 bp 3’-downstream region . we incorporated this ‘replicon’ fragment into two different e. coli plasmid backbones , in order to determine its potential utility for shuttle vector construction. the plasmid construction strategy is outlined in figure  <dig>  the pz7- <dig>  and pz7c  plasmids contain the same  <dig>  bp hindiii/bamhi fragment from pzmo <dig>  but on a pacyc- <dig> and puc <dig> backbone, respectively.

qualitative evaluation of pzmo7-derived shuttle vector stability in z. mobilis under selective culture conditions
to determine the potential utility of pzmo7-derived shuttle vectors for heterologous gene expression in z. mobilis, we first investigated the stability of pz7c within three different strain lineages: ncimb  <dig>  atcc  <dig>   <cit> , and cu <dig> rif <dig>   <cit> . the pz7c plasmid could be transformed into all three strains by electroporation, with transformation efficiencies of ca.  <dig> × 10- <dig> for the ncimb  <dig> strain, ca.  <dig> × 10- <dig> for cu <dig> rif <dig> and ca.  <dig> × 10- <dig> for atcc  <dig> . plasmid pz7c was stably maintained for more than  <dig> generations in all three strains when cells were cultured in rm medium containing 100 μg/ml chloramphenicol . an agarose gel of  plasmid dna present in the three wild type  and pz7c-transformed strains is shown in additional file  <dig> . the introduction of pz7c appeared to have little effect on the respective levels of the endogenous plasmids within the atcc  <dig> and cu <dig> rif <dig> strains. however, when the recombinant ncimb 11163/pz7c strain was propagated in rm medium containing chloramphenicol, the intensity of the band corresponding to the endogenous pzmo <dig> plasmid decreased markedly compared to the wild type strain . this finding indicates that there is most probably direct competition for replication between the endogenous pzmo <dig> plasmid and the pz7c shuttle vector within the same cell. however, the introduction of pz7c had no apparent effects on the levels of the smaller endogenous pzmo1a plasmid, suggesting that it utilized a non-competing mode of replication. equivalent results were obtained with the pz7- <dig> plasmid .

qualitative evaluation of pz7c plasmid stability under non-selective culture conditions
the stability of pz7c within the ncimb  <dig>  cu <dig> rif <dig> and atcc  <dig> strains during propagation under non-selective conditions was investigated using a previously described approach  <cit> . as may be seen in additional file  <dig>  the levels of the pz7c plasmid remained relatively constant within the cu <dig> rif <dig> and atcc  <dig> strains during this process of serial sub-culturing under non-selective conditions. this indicated that a selectable marker was not essentially required for stable maintenance of the pz7c plasmid for a period of ca. 50- <dig> generations in the atcc  <dig> and cu <dig> rif <dig> strains. the situation was markedly different in the ncimb  <dig> strain, where pz7c levels dropped to barely detectable amounts only 24 hours  after the removal of the selectable marker . this was further verified by results from quantitative pcr  experiments performed under analogous conditions .

copy number determination for native pzmo1a and pzmo <dig> plasmids in z. mobilis ncimb 11163
before performing a more detailed analysis of their plasmid copy numbers , we first determined the relative proportions of the endogenous pzmo1a and pzmo <dig>  plasmids present within z. mobilis ncimb  <dig> using a gel-based approach. the respective band intensities indicated that the pcn of pzmo1a was approximately 2- <dig> times that of pzmo <dig> .

quantitative real time pcr  was used for a more accurate determination of the respective plasmid copy numbers, according to the method described by skulj et al. <cit> . using this relative quantification approach, the pcn is determined by quantifying the number of plasmid molecules per chromosome molecules in each sample using specific qpcr primer sets. we designed two sets of qpcr primers for each plasmid, which targeted distinct loci: the rep and mob genes of pzmo <dig>  as well as the rep gene and a non-coding region of the pzmo1a plasmid . the polyphosphate kinase  <dig>  gene, a highly-conserved single copy gene present on the chromosomes of all characterized z. mobilis strains  was selected as a reference genetic locus for the determination of z. mobilis chromosome copy number.

the two respective pairs of qpcr primers that targeted distinct regions on the pzmo1a or pzmo <dig> plasmids were then directly compared, to investigate whether or not there were notable differences in the pcn values obtained. the pcn for pzmo <dig> was determined to be  <dig>  ±  <dig>  when the rep gene was targeted, and was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  when the mob gene was targeted. in analogous experiments, the pcn of pzmo1a was found to be  <dig>  ±  <dig>  using the primer pair that targeted the rep gene, and was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  using the primer pair that targeted a predicted non-coding region of the plasmid. this data correlated closely with the estimates of relative pzmo1a and pzmo <dig> plasmid abundances determined using gel-densitometry . the consistent nature of the pcn values obtained indicated that both of the respective pairs of qpcr primers had equivalent target specificities and amplification efficiencies.

we next used qpcr to investigate whether the pcns of pzmo <dig> and pzmo1a in cultured z. mobilis ncimb  <dig> cells varied considerably during the different phases of growth . it was found that pcn of pzmo <dig> was relatively consistent throughout the growth phases, fluctuating slightly at around  <dig>  copies per chromosome. the pcn of pzmo1a was around  <dig>  to  <dig> during the lag and exponential phases, declining to around  <dig>  during the stationary phase.

copy number determination for pzmo7-derived shuttle vectors in the z. mobilis ncimb  <dig>  atcc  <dig> and cu <dig> rif <dig> strains
a similar qpcr strategy was employed to investigate the copy numbers of the pzmo7-derived pz7c and pz7- <dig> plasmids, which had been established within the z. mobilis ncimb  <dig>  atcc  <dig> and cu <dig> rif <dig> strains. we designed and utilized a qpcr primer pair targeting the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase  gene; so that the pcns of pz7c and pz7- <dig> could be distinguished from those of the native pzmo <dig> plasmids within the ncimb  <dig> strain . this enabled pcns to be directly compared between the three strains. results are summarized in table  <dig>  the respective pcns determined for the pz7c and pz7- <dig> vectors were in good agreement with one another, within each of the three strains tested. these shuttle vectors were respectively maintained at ca. 1- <dig> copies per cell within the ncimb strain, and ca. 2- <dig> copies per cell in the cu <dig> rif <dig> strain. copy numbers were notably higher in the atcc  <dig> strain, where the plasmids were respectively present at ca. 20- <dig> copies per cell.
z. mobilis 
ncimb  <dig>  cu <dig> rif <dig> and atcc  <dig> strains


z. mobilis 
quantitative pcr  was used to determine shuttle vector copy number determined using primers targeting the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase  gene. strains were cultivated in rm media containing 100 μg/ml chloramphenicol  at 30°c for 24 hours.

quantitative pcr was then used to evaluate pz7c plasmid copy numbers in the atcc  <dig>  cu <dig> rif <dig> and ncimb <dig> strains during daily sub-culturing under non-selective conditions over  <dig> consecutive days. results are summarized in figure  <dig>  in the ncimb  <dig> strain, levels of the pz7c shuttle vector reduced to ca.  <dig>  copies per cell, 24 hours after the removal of the chloramphenicol selectable marker . by the fifth day, this had fallen to ca.  <dig>  copies per cell . in the cu <dig> rif <dig> strain, the pcn for pz7c varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  over the five days. in the atcc  <dig> strain, pz7c levels varied between  <dig>  and  <dig>  copies per cell. these results indicated that the pcn of the pzmo7-derived pz7c shuttle vector remained relatively stable for at least ca. 50- <dig> cell generations in these two strains, the absence of a selectable marker. this was fully-consistent with results from the agarose gel-based analysis of pz7c plasmid stability in these two strains.

construction of the pz7-gst z. mobilis expression vector
we selected the bacterial ptac promoter to drive gene expression from the shuttle vector, as this approach has previously been shown to work effectively in z. mobilis cells  <cit> . we designed a strategy whereby the  gene of interest would be cloned as in-frame n-terminal fusion to the glutathione s-transferase  gene. this would enable the straightforward detection and efficient one-step purification of any expressed gst–fusion protein within cell lysates, through the use of affinity chromatography with glutathione-derivatized resin. this approach would also enable the analysis of gst-fusion protein expression levels by western blotting, using anti-gst antibodies . to achieve this, a dna cassette that included the ptac promoter, consensus ribosomal binding site, gst gene, multiple cloning site  and downstream terminator  sequence ; was inserted into pz7c to produce pz7-gst . the  genes of interest may be cloned into the pz7-gst expression vector via a variety of commonly-used restriction sites present in the mcs. in this plasmid, the ptac–gst–mcs–term cassette is inserted in the opposite orientation to the plac promoter that originates from the puc <dig> backbone. this ensured that transcription of the gst–heterologous gene fusions would be under the primary control of the ptac promoter. as the laci gene, which encodes the laci repressor protein was not included on the pz7-gst plasmid; gene expression would not be expected to be repressed under normal growth conditions.

analysis of plasmid-based glutathione s-transferase  expression in e. coli, z. mobilis atcc  <dig> and cu <dig> rif <dig> strains
to determine the effectiveness of this gene-expression strategy, we first analyzed gst protein expression levels from the pz7-gst plasmid established within e. coli bl <dig>  and z. mobilis atcc  <dig> and cu <dig> rif <dig> cells. the cell lysate proteins captured by glutathione-affinity chromatography were analyzed by sds-page . it was found that the fractions eluted from the affinity-columns loaded with the e. coli bl <dig> /pz7-gst , z. mobilis atcc 29191/pz7-gst  and cu <dig> rif2/pz7-gst  cell lysates, all contained a band at ca. 26 kda. analysis via mass spectrometry confirmed that this band corresponded to recombinant  gst. the weak band at ca. 29 kda which was apparent in the lysate prepared from wild type z. mobilis atcc  <dig> , was identified as endogenous glutathione s-transferase  from z. mobilis atcc  <dig> . this protein was not observable in the fractions eluted from z. mobilis atcc 29191/pz7-gst, presumably due to its relatively low abundance compared to the recombinant gst.

the fractions eluted from the affinity-columns loaded with z. mobilis atcc  <dig>  atcc 29191/pz7-gst and cu <dig> rif2/pz7-gst cell lysates all contained a common protein band with a molecular mass of ca. 12 kda , which did not appear in the purified e. coli fractions . this was subsequently identified as the  <dig>  kda glyoxalase/bleomycin resistance protein/dioxygenase . this enzyme requires a catalytic amount of reduced glutathione, to detoxify methylglyoxal and its derivatives via s-d-lactoylglutathione to d-lactate  <cit> , suggesting that it may contain a glutathione binding pocket. this factor may explain its notable affinity towards the glutathione-derivatized sepharose resin.

effects of pz7c-gst plasmid maintenance on growth rates
we next investigated whether the presence of the pz7c-gst expression vector significantly affected the growth rates of the ncimb  <dig>  atcc  <dig> and cu <dig> rif <dig> stains. the cell doubling times were as follows: ncimb  <dig>  104 ± 7 minutes; ncimb 11163/pz7-gst, 139 ± 13 minutes; cu <dig> rif <dig>  95 ± 4 minutes; cu <dig> rif2/pz7c-gst, 111 ± 5 minutes; atcc  <dig>  85 ± 6 minutes; atcc 29191/pz7gst, 102 ± 9 minutes . these results indicated that the maintenance of the pz7c-gst expression vector led to only modest decreases in the growth rates , compared to the respective wild type strains.

expression of gst-fusion proteins from pz7c-derived vectors in e. coli and z. mobilis
to demonstrate the applicability of the pzmo7-derived shuttle vectors for proteomic and biotechnological applications in z. mobilis, we selected five proteins for expression analysis and binding-interaction analysis in the atcc  <dig> strain: acyl-carrier protein , 2-dehydro-3-deoxyphosphooctonate aldolase , chaperone protein dnaj , rna chaperone hfq  and dna polymerase iii chi subunit . these proteins were previously included in a large scale analysis of protein-protein binding interactions in e. coli <cit> . all five genes were successfully cloned into the pz7-gst expression vector, creating the respective n-terminal gst fusions: pz7-gst-acpp; pz7-gst-kdsa; pz7-gst-dnaj; pz7-gst-hfq and pz7-gst-holc. we first qualitatively determined the respective expression levels of the five pz7-gst plasmid-encoded gst-fusion proteins within e. coli bl <dig> ; including plasmid pz7-gst as a positive control. sds-page gels of the cell lysate proteins eluted from the gst-affinity columns are shown in additional file  <dig>  it was found that the recombinant gst, gst-acpp, gst-hfq and gst-kdsa proteins were expressed to detectable levels; with levels of gst-acpp being the highest. plasmid-encoded gst-fusions of the dnaj and holc proteins were not expressed to visually detectable levels.

analogous protein expression experiments were then performed in the atcc  <dig> and cu <dig> rif <dig> strains of z. mobilis. to investigate whether there were significant differences in plasmid-based protein expression patterns during different metabolic/respiratory modes of growth, the respective wild type and transformed strains were cultured under both semi-aerobic and anaerobic conditions. sds-polyacrylamide gels of the respective eluted fractions are shown in figure  <dig>  panels a-d. the gst, gst-acpp, gst-kdsa and gst-hfq proteins were expressed to visually-detectable levels in both the atcc  <dig> and cu <dig> rif <dig> strains, under both conditions . it may be seen that there were only minor inter-strain differences in the relative expression levels of the plasmid-encoded proteins under semi-aerobic or anaerobic conditions.

western blotting experiments using anti-gst antibodies were performed to confirm the identities of the recombinant gst-fusion proteins observed on the sds-polyacrylamide gels. this technique also enabled the detection of gst-containing proteins present at low levels, as well as ones that had been otherwise modified within the cell. the gel blots of the plasmid-encoded gst and  <dig> gst-fusion proteins respectively expressed in the atcc  <dig> and cu <dig> rif <dig> strains are shown in additional file  <dig>  consistent with the coomassie stained gel images, the expression of the gst, gst-acpp, gst-kdsa and gst-hfq proteins was clearly apparent . however, the blots also revealed that the gst-dnaj protein was also expressed in both strains; with a partially-degraded form predominating in the cu <dig> rif <dig> strain .

to further probe the utility of pz7c-derived shuttle vectors for biotechnological applications in z. mobilis, we quantified the respective levels of recombinant gst and gst-fusion proteins expressed from the pz7-gst, pz7-gst-acpp and pz7-gst-kdsa vectors established in the atcc  <dig> strain, when cultured under semi-aerobic conditions to an od600nm of ca.  <dig> - <dig>  results indicated that ca. 5 mg of recombinant gst, 2-3 mg of gst-acpp and 4 mg of gst-kdsa were expressed and recovered from  <dig> -3 g wet cell mass of the respective z. mobilis atcc  <dig> transformant strains.

z. mobilis protein binding interaction analysis via gst-affinity chromatography
bands were carefully excised from the sds-page gels of fractions eluted from the gst-affinity columns, so that co-purifying protein species and/or background proteins could be identified via mass spectrometry. as may be seen in figure  <dig>  the ca. 12 kda glyoxalase/bleomycin resistance protein  and ca. 29 kda glutathione-s-transferase  were commonly observed in eluted fraction from the plasmid-free control and all transformant strains. even with the propitious use of protease inhibitors, a complex, heterogeneous mixture of low molecular weight proteins/protein fragments co-migrated with the glo protein, near the gel front. proteins that were respectively co-purified with either the gst-acpp or gst-kdsa ‘bait’ proteins, but were absent in all other eluted fractions, were identified as forming putative binding interactions . the four identified protein species that co-purified with recombinant gst-acpp were: pyruvate decarboxylase , glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , -hydroxymyristoyl-acp dehydratase  and holo-acyl-carrier-protein synthase . the four identified protein species that co-purified with gst-kdsa were: translation elongation factor ts ; translation elongation factor tu ; cytidine 5’-triphosphate  synthase  and chaperone protein dnak . none of these proteins were identified in controls. it may be noted that not all of the  co-purifying proteins could be unambiguously identified.

discussion
even though the ncimb  <dig>  strain of z. mobilis was included in the seminal review by swings and de ley  <cit> , and its genome sequence was announced in  <dig>  <cit> , it has been the subject of very few investigations in the scientific literature. consequently, there are no reports concerning the properties of its native plasmids, nor reports of their use for the construction of recombinant plasmids. here, we describe the construction, intracellular stability and biological utilization of shuttle-vectors derived from the pzmo <dig>  native plasmid from this strain.

replication and stability of pzmo7-derived recombinant plasmids in z. mobilis
the pzmo7-derived shuttle vectors constructed here  could be transformed into three distinct lineages of z. mobilis, without apparent genetic  alteration upon prolonged culture or repeated subculture. our data suggests that there is direct competition between the native pzmo <dig> plasmids and recombinant pzmo7-derived shuttle vectors for access to the replication-related machinery within the ncimb  <dig> strain. this hypothesis is consistent with the previously-proposed competition between native pzmo <dig> and recombinant pzmo2-derived plasmids  in the cu <dig> rif <dig> strain  <cit> . however, this competition for plasmid replication appears to be largely absent in the atcc  <dig> and cu <dig> rif <dig> strains. homologues of the rep_ <dig> superfamily replicase protein  encoded by pzmo <dig> do not appear to be present in plasmids belonging to any z. mobilis strain sequenced to date, including atcc  <dig>  atcc  <dig> and atcc  <dig>  these results suggest that the pzmo7-derived rep_ <dig> superfamily replicase protein and/or its corresponding plasmid replication origin function orthogonally to other z. mobilis plasmid replication systems. the cellular stabilities and replicative properties of pzmo7-derived shuttle vectors within other z. mobilis lineages remains to be established.

the copy numbers of the pz7c and pz7- <dig> shuttle vectors varied considerably in the three z. mobilis strains tested. however, their respective pcns were closely matched within the same strain . this indicated that the respective puc <dig> or pacyc- <dig> derived plasmid backbones had little effect on their replication properties within z. mobilis; which were primarily governed by the ca.  <dig>  bp replicon fragment from pzmo <dig>  copy number was highest in the atcc  <dig> strain , and considerably lower in the ncimb  <dig> and cu <dig> rif <dig> strains . further detailed studies will be required to establish the physiological basis for this inter-strain variation in pcn.

protein expression and proteomic applications within z. mobilis
to demonstrate a proof of principle, we selected a well-established glutathione/glutathione s-transferase  affinity ‘pull-down’ approach  <cit>  for use in z. mobilis. in addition to functioning as a convenient method for one-step protein isolation,  gst fusions have previously been shown to be beneficial for the expression of soluble  proteins in bacteria  <cit> . the acpp, kdsa, dnaj, hfq and holc proteins selected as ‘bait’ were included in a previous proteomic study conducted in e. coli <cit> . with the exception of the hfq rna chaperone  <cit> , the respective properties of these proteins have not previously been analyzed in z. mobilis. four out of five proteins were expressed in a soluble form in both the atcc  <dig> and cu <dig> rif <dig> strains, clearly demonstrating the effectiveness of the pz7-gst vector-based system. the gst-holc protein may have been expressed in an insoluble form, thus failing to be recovered in the  cell lysate fractions. co-purifying proteins were identified for two of the four gst-fusion proteins that were expressed in the atcc  <dig> strain . however, it should be noted that the plasmid-based gst-fusion protein expression is performed in a wild-type chromosomal background. consequently, the gst-tagged bait proteins will be in direct competition with the corresponding endogenous bait proteins, for the capture of binding partners within the cell. hence it may not be possible to capture and purify sufficient levels of interacting protein species to enable their subsequent detection or identification.

the acyl carrier protein acpp, which acts as a covalent carrier of fatty acid intermediates during their biosynthesis, co-purified with four other functionally-related enzymes. these were the pyruvate decarboxylase , which catalyzes the decarboxylation of pyruvate, an intermediate in the fatty acid cycle glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , which catalyzes the dehydrogenation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, another intermediate in this cycle hydroxymyristoyl-acp dehydratase , which catalyzes the dehydration of short chain beta-hydroxyacyl-acps and long chain saturated and unsaturated beta-hydroxyacyl-acps); as well as and holo-acyl carrier protein synthase  proteins  <cit> , which is involved in the transfer of phosphopantetheine to acp. to date, only the fabz-acpp and acps-acpp protein binding associations have been described in the database of interacting proteins   <cit> , string  <cit> , or the prolinks databases  <cit> . however, it should also be noted that we did not detect additional protein interactions that were previously observed in e. coli <cit> ; for example, 3-oxoacyl- synthase  <dig> , 3-oxoacyl- synthase iii , malonyl coa-acyl carrier protein transacylase  short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase sdr  were not co-purified with acpp. this may be due to their relatively low cellular abundance under the culture conditions employed, or may be due to the fact that only relatively high-affinity or long-lasting protein-protein interactions are detected using our approach.

kdsa is involved in the early stages of lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis catalyzing the synthesis of 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-d-octonate 8-phosphate  <cit> . this protein was found to interact with ctp synthase ; chaperone protein dnak; elongation factor ts  and elongation factor tu . ctp synthase plays a key role in pyrimidine biosynthesis; inter-converting the utp and ctp nucleotides  <cit> . the dnak chaperone protein is induced in response to cellular stresses such as hyperosmotic shock, and plays important roles in the replication of chromosomal and phage dna  <cit> . elongation factors ts and tu work together, modulating the translation of proteins at the ribosome  <cit> . only the interaction between ctp synthase and kdsa is included in the current versions of the above protein-protein interaction prediction databases. it is conceivable that the other putative protein interactions may be due to functional interplay between dna replication, translation and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis within z. mobilis. however, additional analyses, e.g. reciprocal protein binding interaction experiments are required to verify this speculation.

there have been relatively few literature reports analyzing protein expression patterns in z. mobilis. more than 20 years ago, mejia et al. and an et al. used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to survey the proteome of z. mobilis cp <dig> under various growth conditions, identifying ca. 10- <dig> protein spots  <cit> . most notably, yang et al. have recently conducted a comprehensive ‘systems biology’ analysis of response pathways to ethanol stress in the z. mobilis zm <dig> strain  <cit> . they used a ‘shotgun’ mudpit proteomic approach to quantify protein expression levels under physiological conditions pertinent to ethanol production. networks of functionally-associated proteins were defined using a combination transcriptional, proteomic and data-mining approaches. of relevance to this study, they noted that the dnaj chaperone protein  and hfq rna chaperone  were both up-regulated in response to stress, whilst levels of the kdsa , acpp  were unchanged. expression of the holc dna polymerase iii chi subunit  was not detected. a targeted protein-affinity ‘pull-down’ approach such as the one described here may be used to complement such large scale studies, verifying protein associations inferred by other in silico or experimental approaches.

CONCLUSIONS
whilst quantitative  pcr approaches have previously been used to establish plasmid copy numbers in microbes, this is the first time it has been used to evaluate plasmid levels in zymomonas, or closely-related alphaproteobacterial species. our results indicate that shuttle vectors containing the replicon from the pzmo <dig>  native plasmid from z. mobilis ncimb  <dig> may be stably maintained in multi-copy levels for more than  <dig> generations in the atcc  <dig> and  cu <dig> rif <dig> strains, in the absence of a selectable marker. a selectable marker is required for stable pzmo7-derived shuttle vector maintenance in the parental ncimb  <dig> strain, most probably due to replicative competition with endogenous pzmo <dig> plasmids. the replication of pzmo <dig> and pzmo <dig> plasmids appears to function in an orthologous, and non-competitive manner.

the pzmo <dig> shuttle vector-based expression of n-terminal gst-fusions of ‘bait’ proteins enables the composition of intracellular protein complexes in z. mobilis to be probed in a convenient and straightforward manner. the co-purification of established and putative functionally-related proteins validates the use of this experimental approach. taken together, our data suggests that the composition of protein complexes within z. mobilis cells may share significant similarity to those found in e. coli, saccharomyces cerevisae and other microbial species  <cit> .
