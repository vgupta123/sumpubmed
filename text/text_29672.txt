BACKGROUND
the atlantic cod  is an important commercial species in several countries including canada, usa and norway, whose supply has been threatened by declining wild stocks
 <cit> . in recent years, the aquaculture of cod has emerged as a potential alternative source of fish for these markets
 <cit> . unfortunately, the development of atlantic cod aquaculture still faces many challenges, including our incomplete understanding of how changes in the environment  impact gadoid culture
 <cit> .

atlantic cod reared in sea-cages are confined within a limited space, and therefore, are more likely than wild cod to be subjected to seasonal fluctuations in temperature. for example, high levels of mortality in farmed cod have been observed when temperatures increase during the summer months
 <cit> . the temperatures to which farmed cod are often exposed in the summer months  in themselves, however, are unlikely to be lethal for this species. in fact, previous work from our research group indicates that atlantic cod juveniles can survive an incremental temperature increase of 1°c every 5 days until temperatures reach ~ 22°c .

elevated temperatures have been shown to modulate the immune response of several commercially important fish species such as the rainbow trout 
 <cit> , sea bass 
 <cit> , orange-spotted grouper 
 <cit> , atlantic salmon 
 <cit>  and atlantic cod
 <cit> . however, the influence of temperature on fish immune function is variable. for example, while constant elevated temperatures can enhance the immune response of salmonids , variable temperatures  can be immune suppressive in sea bass
 <cit> . since the thermal regime to which cod are exposed during the spring-summer months in newfoundland is characterized by a gradual increase in temperature  and temperatures do not tend to reach the cod’s critical thermal maximum 
 <cit> , we hypothesized that a temperature-dependent modulation of the immune system, which could lead to increased susceptibility to pathogens, may be associated with the losses sometimes observed in cod sea-cages.

microarrays have been widely used to study the immune-relevant gene expression responses of fish and fish cell lines to pathogens and pathogen-associated molecular patterns  . in this study we used the  <dig>  element  oligonucleotide microarray platform , which includes sequences from both suppression subtractive hybridization  and normalized libraries enriched for immune and heat-stress responsive transcripts
 <cit>  , and reverse transcription – quantitative polymerase chain reaction , to investigate the effects of an increasing temperature regime  on the atlantic cod spleen response to the intra-peritoneal  injection of the viral mimic polyriboinosinic polyribocytidylic acid . a better understanding of how moderately increased ambient temperature affects the genes and pathways involved in the cod’s anti-viral response may shed light on the potential mechanisms of temperature-induced immune suppression
 <cit> . this knowledge will not only be important for the emerging atlantic cod aquaculture industry, but may also be valuable to our understanding of how accelerated global climate change
 <cit>  may impact cold-water marine finfish species.

RESULTS
plasma cortisol
plasma cortisol averaged   <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ng ml- <dig> in the “control before temperature increase”  and “heat-exposed before temperature increase”  groups, respectively. cortisol values were approximately two-fold higher ~ 5 weeks later  in both sets of fish  with the “control before injection”  group showing average cortisol levels of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ng ml- <dig> and the “heat-exposed before injection”  group showing average cortisol levels of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ng ml- <dig>  however, there were no significant differences in cortisol levels between the groups at either time point, or within the groups between time points.

impact of non-lethal chronic temperature elevation on the spleen transcriptome
the first analysis carried out using significance analysis of microarrays  assessed the impact of the temperature increase alone on the cod spleen transcriptome. this analysis was carried out to investigate whether changes in the spleen transcriptome caused by temperature alone could be indicative of immune suppression. we compared  <dig> individuals from the cbi group to  <dig> individuals from the hbi group using a modified t-test assuming unequal variances in the sam algorithm
 <cit>  as implemented in the bioconductor package siggenes. the gradual 6°c increase in temperature had a very minor impact on spleen mrna expression. only  <dig> probes  were identified as differentially expressed  between the cbi and the hbi groups .

impact of pic injection on the spleen transcriptome
polyriboinosinic polyribocytidylic acid  injected fish were also compared to their time- and temperature-matched phosphate buffered saline  injected controls using sam. this gave us the following four comparisons: pic 6hpi vs. pbs 6hpi  and pic 24hpi vs. pbs 24hpi . we identified  <dig>  differentially expressed probes  between the pic 6hpi vs. pbs 6hpi at 10°c ,  <dig> probes  between the pic 6hpi vs. pbs 6hpi at 16°c ,  <dig> probes  between pic 24hpi vs. pbs 24hpi at 10°c , and  <dig> probes  between pic 24hpi vs. pbs 24hpi at 16°c . selected probes having immune-related functional annotations are presented alongside overall fold-change values  in tables

we also compared the pbs-injected fish to the temperature-matched pre-injected fish  to ensure that they were suitable controls. in this analysis, we found  <dig> probes differentially expressed  between the pbs 6hpi@10°c and cbi groups,  <dig> differentially expressed probes between the pbs 6hpi@16°c and hbi groups,  <dig> differentially expressed probes between the pbs 24hpi@10°c and cbi groups, and  <dig> differentially expressed probes between the pbs 24hpi@16°c and hbi groups . given that only a small overlap  was observed between the probes identified in these comparisons and the pic vs. pbs comparisons , we concluded that the pbs groups were a suitable control for injection stress.

impact of increased temperature on pic-induced mrna expression
in order to study the effect of the gradual temperature increase on the cod spleen transcript expression response to pic, we performed two direct comparisons: pic 6hpi@16°c vs. pic 6hpi@10°c and pic 24hpi@16°c vs. pic 24hpi@10°c. this approach detected  <dig> differentially expressed probes   between pic 6hpi@16°c and pic 6hpi@10°c  and  <dig> differentially expressed probes  between pic 24hpi@16°c and pic 24hpi@10°c . selected microarray-identified probes having immune-related functional annotations are presented with fold-change values in tables
 <dig> and
 <dig>  for complete information on these probes, including raw p-values, d-values and standard deviations, please refer to additional file

we further analyzed these genes using gene ontology  and hierarchical clustering analyses. two distinct analyses were used to look at go terms mapped to genes differentially expressed between fish injected with pic at  <dig> and 16°c. one analysis consisted of plotting level  <dig> go terms  mapped to the genes differentially expressed between fish injected with pic at  <dig> and 16°c . the second analysis consisted of using gossip as implemented in blast2go to perform fisher’s exact test to check if any go terms  were significantly  enriched in the genes responding to pic  at  <dig> and 16°c for both time points. figure
 <dig> shows four pie charts depicting the proportions of level  <dig> biological process go terms of: a) the  <dig> genes  more highly expressed in fish injected with pic and sampled 6hpi at 16°c in comparison to the time-matched pic injected fish at 10°c; b) the  <dig> genes  more highly expressed in fish injected with pic at 10°c and sampled 6hpi in comparison to the time-matched pic injected fish at 16°c; c) the  <dig> genes  more highly expressed in fish injected with pic at 16°c and sampled 24hpi in comparison to the time-matched pic injected fish at 10°c; and d) the  <dig> genes  more highly expressed in fish injected with pic at 10°c and sampled 24hpi in comparison with the time-matched pic injected fish at 16°c.

several biological processes were highly represented  in the  <dig> genes differentially expressed between fish stimulated with pic at the different temperatures . among these were: cellular component organization, cellular process, developmental process, signaling, biological regulation, response to stimulus, immune system process, and death. only  <dig> biological process level  <dig> go terms were mapped to the  <dig> genes more highly expressed in fish stimulated with pic at 10°c and sampled at 6hpi compared to those stimulated with pic at 16°c and sampled at the same time point. this is likely a reflection of the low number of probes in this particular gene list. fifteen of the level  <dig> biological process go terms that were mapped to the genes more highly expressed in fish stimulated with pic at 16°c and sampled at 6hpi were also mapped to the genes that were more highly expressed in fish stimulated with pic at 10°c and sampled at 24hpi ; we also found that  <dig> probes were present in both gene lists  . however, many of the go terms that were in common between these lists had more sequences mapped to them in the list of probes more highly expressed in fish stimulated with pic at 10°c and sampled at 24hpi compared to the time-matched fish stimulated with pic at 16°c. examples are signaling , immune system process , death , biological regulation , response to stimulus  and cellular process .

the go enrichment analysis also identified several go terms with significantly different over-/under-representation between the genes up-regulated by pic  at 24hpi at the two temperatures. most go terms  identified were over-represented in the genes up-regulated by pic at 16°c compared with those up-regulated by pic injection at 10°c . examples of these over-represented go terms in the 24hpi list of pic responsive genes at 16°c are: protein folding , negative regulation of cellular process , negative regulation of protein metabolic process , regulation of interferon-gamma-mediated-signaling , regulation of signaling process , regulation of signal transduction , regulation of cytokine-mediated signaling pathway , unfolded protein binding  and enzyme regulatory activity . two go terms were under-represented in the 24hpi list of pic responsive genes at 16°c: macromolecule modification  and protein modification process .

we present  <dig> separate clustering results displayed as heat-maps . in these heat-maps, all individuals  were clustered based on their expression for the genes identified as differentially expressed between the pic@16°c and pic@10°c groups at 6hpi  or at 24hpi . in figure
 <dig>  panel a shows the entire heat-map for the 6hpi time point, while panel b shows a sub-tree  dominated by genes belonging to the interferon  pathway. figure
 <dig> shows the entire heat-map for the 24hpi time point, while figure
 <dig> shows a sub-tree  dominated by genes belonging to the interferon  pathway. both clustering results show a clear distinction  between the groups of fish injected with pic at the different temperatures and time points. based on the expression of the genes identified in the above-mentioned comparisons, the pic, 6hpi @10°c group had an expression profile more similar to that of the non-pic stimulated fish, while the pic, 6hpi @16°c group’s expression profile was more similar to that of the pic, 24hpi @10°c group. for the non-pic stimulated fish , the clusters were less distinctive.

qpcr validation of selected immune-relevant genes
genes of interest  were selected for qpcr analysis based on their putative roles in pathogen detection, signal transduction/transcription control and as immune effectors; the qpcr data is presented in figures
 <dig> 
 <dig>  and
 <dig>  respectively, as average log <dig> transformed relative quantities  ± se. fifteen of the immune-relevant genes  were validated as being significantly  differentially expressed in at least one comparison  from which they were identified as informative probes in the microarray experiment. there are several possible explanations for disagreement between microarray and qpcr results . for tlr <dig> and irak <dig> in the current study, there may have been related sequences  binding to these probe in the array and influencing hybridization results. also, the fact that  <dig> of the individuals used in the qpcr experiment were not part of the microarray experiment may have contributed to the disagreement between microarray and qpcr results for these two genes. of the  <dig> genes with putative pathogen detection roles that were subjected to qpcr,  <dig>  were validated . in the qpcr experiment for genes potentially involved in pathogen detection, dhx <dig> showed the highest fold up-regulation in response to pic  and the highest fold differential expression between fish injected with pic at different temperatures  . pkr showed the same trend but with lower, and yet significant, fold-changes .

of the  <dig> microarray-identified genes with putative roles in signal transduction/transcription control analyzed with qpcr,  <dig>  were validated. qpcr analysis showed that iκbα mrna was only differentially expressed between groups at the 6hpi time point . all three studied transcripts encoding interferon regulatory factors  showed very similar expression profiles at the mrna level. these genes responded significantly to pic at both temperatures and time points, although the magnitude of the fold up-regulation was variable. of all studied irfs, irf <dig> at the 6hpi time point showed the highest response to pic  and the highest fold difference between fish injected with pic at  <dig> vs. 10°c . at the 24hpi time point, irf <dig> showed the highest response to pic  and the highest fold difference between fish injected with pic at  <dig> vs. 16°c . of all the genes with putative roles in signal transduction/transcription control, znfx <dig> showed the highest response to pic at 10°c . as previously mentioned, the microarray results for irak <dig>  were not validated by qpcr analysis .

all  <dig> of the putative immune-effector genes studied with qpcr showed significant differential expression at 6hpi and 24hpi between fish injected with pic vs. pbs at  <dig> and/or 16°c . further, they showed the highest fold-changes of all the transcripts studied with qpcr. at 6hpi, isg <dig> showed the highest response to pic at both temperatures , and rsad <dig>   showed the highest differential mrna expression between fish injected with pic at the two temperatures . at 24hpi, isg <dig> also showed the highest response to pic at both temperatures  , while il- <dig> presented the highest fold difference between fish stimulated with pic at  <dig> vs. 16°c  . isg <dig> was the only microarray identified, qpcr studied putative immune-effector transcript for which not all differences detected on the microarray were validated by qpcr. while isg <dig> was identified as being differently expressed  between fish injected with pic at  <dig> vs. 16°c at 24hpi in the microarray experiment, only a non-significant change in the same direction was observed in the qpcr at 24hpi.

discussion
variations in temperature are an inevitable element of cage-site based aquaculture
 <cit> . we used a regimen of gradual increases in water temperature that simulated the environmental conditions to which the farmed atlantic cod can be exposed during the spring-summer transition in sea-cages in newfoundland, and microarrays and qpcr to study the impact of changes in rearing temperature on the spleen anti-viral transcriptome response of cod. several studies
 <cit>  have used functional genomics approaches to study the individual impact of stress or immune stimulation on fish transcriptomes; however, to our knowledge, the current study is the first to use global gene expression analysis to investigate the impact of elevated water temperature on the anti-viral immune transcriptome of a fish species. we were able to demonstrate at the mrna level that, while a gradual non-lethal increase in water temperature from 10°c to 16°c only caused minor changes in the spleen transcriptome, it had a major influence on the cod spleen gene expression response to ip injection with the viral mimic pic.

influence of elevated temperature on plasma cortisol and the spleen transcriptome
in the present study, plasma cortisol levels did not increase significantly when cod were exposed to the increasing temperature regimen. this finding suggests that our juvenile cod were not stressed under these conditions, and that the differences observed in the pic response of fish exposed to elevated temperatures may not have been the result of transcriptional changes driven by the glucocorticoid receptor . however, this is in contrast to the results of pérez-casanova et al.
 <cit>  who reported plasma cortisol values of ~ 52 ng ml- <dig> in similar sized cod that had been warmed from 10°c to 16°c using a similar protocol. this discrepancy is likely due to the fact that pérez-casanova et al.
 <cit>  sampled their fish as temperature reached 16°c, whereas we sampled the cod after they were given a week to acclimate to this temperature. it is probable that the extra week to which our fish were exposed to 16°c allowed their cortisol  level to return towards basal values. this hypothesis is also supported by pérez-casanova et al.
 <cit> , as these authors reported that cod plasma cortisol levels decreased on day  <dig> of their experiment  and that values remained at pre-stress levels as temperature was increased further.

increasing water temperature to 16°c alone had a very small impact on the cod spleen transcriptome . using microarrays, we were unable to detect any differential expression of β2-microglobulin, mhc-i or igm heavy chain transcripts due to increases in water temperature alone. this result is again different from the results of pérez-casanova et al.
 <cit>  who showed, using qpcr with blood cdna templates, that these genes were differentially expressed between cod at 16°c and at 10°c. although we cannot rule out tissue-specific differences  in the response of these genes to the temperature increase, it is also possible that the different sampling regimes  could explain these disparate findings. when this data is combined with that for plasma cortisol levels, it suggests that prolonged exposure of atlantic cod juveniles to sea-cage temperatures of 16°c  is unlikely to have negative consequences with regards to their stress state or basal immune transcript expression.

temperature effects on the atlantic cod spleen anti-viral transcriptome
compared to the time- and temperature-matched pbs controls, pic altered the expression of  <dig>  and  <dig>  transcripts in 10°c fish at 6hpi and 24hpi, respectively, and  <dig>  and  <dig>  transcripts in 16°c fish at 6hpi and 24hpi, respectively . figure
 <dig> shows a summary of the go terms that were associated with the genes differentially expressed between fish injected with pic at the different temperatures and sampled at 6hpi  and 24hpi . not surprisingly, immune system process, signaling and response to stimulus were found in  <dig> out of the  <dig> pie charts in relatively high proportions . these results indicate, as previous reports have shown
 <cit> , that elevated temperatures can induce changes in the fish’s immune response to an antigen. furthermore, we suggest that the genes associated with these go terms  may be good candidates for the development of molecular markers  to be used in marker assisted selection  programs aimed at developing elite broodstock  for the atlantic cod aquaculture industry.

the sample clustering based on genes differentially expressed between the groups injected with pic and sampled at 6hpi shows that the expression profile of pic injected fish held at 10°c and sampled at 6hpi was most similar to that of the non-immune stimulated  fish than to the profile of any other group of fish injected with pic  . in addition, clustering based on the  <dig> genes differentially expressed between fish injected with pic at the different temperatures and sampled at 24hpi , indicates that the mrna expression profile of pic-injected fish held at 16°c and sampled 6hpi was most similar to that of fish injected with pic at 10°c and sampled at 24hpi. collectively, these data suggest that the moderate increase in water temperature caused a time shift in the transcriptomic response of cod spleen to pic, with fish held at elevated temperature  having an earlier maximum response  than fish held at optimal temperature , which had a later maximum response . raida and buchmann
 <cit>  report similar data for mrna expression of immune-relevant genes in the spleen of rainbow trout injected with a yersinia ruckeri bacterin. these authors found that peak transcript expression of il-1β, il- <dig> and ifn-γ happened earlier in fish stimulated at 15°c or 25°c when compared to fish stimulated at 5°c. furthermore, it is clear from our heat-maps that, overall, the magnitude of response to pic for these genes was greatest in the pic stimulated fish at 10°c and sampled at 24hpi. this result, however, must be interpreted with caution. our results suggest that holding cod at 16°c may result in a faster, but weaker, immune response to a viral mimic; this hypothesis could be tested in the future by sampling pic-injected cod exposed to similar temperature regimes at more frequent intervals post-injection. in future research, more frequent sampling  may allow one to determine if the maximum induction of pic responsive genes that we observed in the fish held at elevated temperature  and sampled 6 hours after pic-injection is the peak response, which would indicate that there is indeed a weaker maximal pic response in these fish compared with fish held at optimal temperature . however, if peak spleen transcript expression response to pic occurs before or after 6hpi for fish held at elevated temperature, and before or after 24hpi for fish held at optimal temperature, this could be determined in future studies incorporating more frequent post-injection sampling.

using the clustering of genes based on their expression profiles for each sample, we were able to identify many different clusters, including one from each time point that is highly enriched for putative members of the interferon pathway. these clusters are marked in blue on figures
5a and
 <dig> and shown in detail in figures
5b and
 <dig>  the interferon pathway is a key part of the fish innate response to viruses
 <cit> , and our results indicate that elevated temperature had a considerable impact on the cod innate immune response to a viral mimic.

impacts of the gradual temperature increase on transcript expression
genes with putative viral detection roles
one of the key steps in mounting an anti-viral innate immune response  is the detection of an invading pathogen. this recognition often occurs via the detection of a set of pathogen associated molecular patterns . pamps bind specifically to germ-line pattern recognition receptors , which in turn activate signaling pathways that induce the innate immune response
 <cit> . the immune-stimulant used in this experiment  is a double-stranded rna  that mimics the genome and/or rna intermediates of several viruses and is recognized by prrs, including the toll-like receptor  <dig> . several genes putatively belonging to the tlr pathway  have been identified in fish
 <cit>  . while tlr3-like transcript was shown to be slightly up-regulated by pic in 16°c fish at 6hpi on the microarray , the qpcr analysis did not confirm this result . in fact, we did not detect any significant changes in tlr <dig> transcript due to pic injection using qpcr. this is not surprising as rise et al.
 <cit>  obtained similar qpcr results for tlr <dig>  in spleens from cod stimulated with pic. however, it suggests that the differences in response to pic between fish held at  <dig> vs. 16°c were not caused by an enhanced sensitivity to double-stranded rna due to an over-expression of tlr <dig> in the spleens of fish held at 16°c and injected with pic. the results of rodriguez et al.
 <cit>  for in vivo stimulation of rainbow trout with ip injection of pic also agree with ours, as these authors detected no significant induction of tlr <dig> mrna following injection of this viral mimic. interestingly, these authors and others
 <cit>  have shown up to ~30-fold induction of tlr <dig> transcripts by pic in isolated rainbow trout cells/cell culture, and this is similar to what has been observed in mammalian macrophages
 <cit> .

in the current study, tlr <dig> transcripts were found by both the microarray and qpcr analyses to be significantly up-regulated by pic at 6hpi in 16°c fish, and at 24hpi for fish held at 10°c ; the qpcr analysis showed that mrna levels of tlr <dig> were significantly different between  <dig> and 16°c pic injected fish sampled at 6hpi . like in mammals, the main ligand of tlr <dig> in fish is thought to be viral/bacterial unmethylated cpg dna
 <cit> . it is unclear what the roles of tlr <dig> during the host response to viral dsrna could be, but it is apparent that temperature can also have an impact on the responses of fish to other pathogens such as bacteria by modulating tlr <dig> mrna expression
 <cit> . further research is warranted to elucidate the modulations of tlrs by antigens and/or changes in the environment in teleost fish.

other important sensors of viruses are cytosolic prrs, such as the rig-i like receptors  and the dsrna activated protein kinase . dhx <dig>  is a rlr that was found to be highly induced at the mrna level by pic compared to pbs at both 10°c and 16°c and also differentially expressed  between fish injected with pic at  <dig> and 16°c at both time points in the qpcr and microarray experiments . previous studies have reported up-regulation of dhx <dig> mrna by pic in both cod spleen and brain
 <cit> . in addition, qpcr was used to show that dhx <dig> mrna was significantly up-regulated in the brains
 <cit> , but not the spleens
 <cit> , of asymptomatic high nodavirus carrier atlantic cod. as in rise et al.
 <cit>  we detected peak up-regulation of dhx <dig> mrna at 24hpi for fish injected with pic at 10°c. in the spleens of fish injected with pic at 16°c, the fold up-regulation  of dhx <dig> transcript was similar at 6hpi and 24hpi  . the roles of dhx <dig> in the anti-viral response are still unclear
 <cit> . however, there is some experimental evidence that it may induce or repress rig-i/mda <dig> dependent signal transduction in a virus-dependent manner
 <cit> . thus, it is still not clear what impacts the observed temperature-dependent modulation of dhx <dig> response to pic could have in the anti-viral immunity of cod. we observed similar differences in the expression of pkr mrna . like tlr <dig>  dhx <dig>  stat <dig>  deltex <dig>  znfx <dig>  il- <dig> and sacs, pkr did not respond to pic at 6hpi in fish held at 10°c, but it was significantly up-regulated at the same time point in the spleens of fish held at 16°c and injected with pic. in mammals, the main anti-viral function of pkr was originally thought to be the phosphorylation of eif2α, leading to reduced protein synthesis
 <cit> . more recently, it has been demonstrated that pkr has roles in modulating apoptosis via nf-κb and the growth-inhibitory activity of irf1
 <cit> . therefore the observed influence of pic, temperature and time on pkr mrna expression could impact the fish’s ability to fight a viral infection.

genes with putative roles in signal transduction and transcription regulation
in mammals, downstream signaling of tlrs and rlrs involves activation of nf-κb transcription factors
 <cit> . there is some evidence of a similar mechanism in fish, since expression constructs containing a constitutively active form of the zebrafish  tlr <dig> transfected into zfl cells induced nf-κb mediated luciferase fluorescence
 <cit> . an important step in tlr signaling in mammals is the activation of the inhibitor of nf-κb kinases , which in turn phosphorylate the inhibitor of nf-κb proteins . phosphorylation targets iκbs for degradation, and in their absence, the nf-κb proteins accumulate in the nucleus and regulate mrna transcription
 <cit> . in higher vertebrates, iκbα is thought to regulate transient activation of nf-κb. as such it is rapidly degraded in response to stressful stimuli, but then quickly re-synthesized due to the presence of an nf-κb response element in its promoter region
 <cit>  . at 6hpi, both the microarray and the qpcr studies showed an significant up-regulation of iκbα mrna by pic at both temperatures . this may be an indication of the process of re-synthesis of this protein in the spleen cells following pic stimulation. however, the qpcr-detected up-regulation of iκbα mrna by pic at 6hpi was higher in fish held at 10°c than in fish held at 16°c . moreover, the difference in mrna expression of iκbα between 10°c and 16°c fish injected with pic at 6hpi was also significant . it is possible that the early response of ifn pathway genes observed in the fish held at 16°c  was in part due to a reduced re-synthesis of iκbα, leading to a more pronounced nf-κb-mediated induction of transcription. at 24hpi we detected no significant differences in the mrna expression of iκbα in fish held at 10°c or 16°c with either the microarray  or qpcr  studies. the microarray analysis indicated that ikkα was significantly up-regulated by pic at this point only in the spleens of fish held at 10°c . since ikks are also essential to nf-κb activation, this difference may have contributed to the differences in immune-related gene expression observed at 24hpi . collectively, our results suggest that, as in higher vertebrates, timing and intensity of atlantic cod immune responses are partly regulated by nf-κb transcription factors
 <cit> .

the interferon regulatory factor  genes are also key to the activation of the ifn pathway
 <cit> . in this work all  <dig> irfs  that had been previously identified as pic-responsive in cod
 <cit>  were shown to be up-regulated in spleen by this viral mimic . moreover, all studied irfs presented the same overall expression profile as most ifn pathway-related genes identified in this study. this profile is characterized by a higher expression at 6hpi in fish injected with pic and held at 16°c vs. 10°c, but greater expression in this latter group at 24hpi. in higher vertebrates both irf <dig> and irf <dig> have been implicated as positive modulators of the type i ifn response to viruses, with irf <dig> being essential for interferon-related gene expression
 <cit> . furthermore, in the current microarray experiment tank-binding kinase  <dig> , which activates irf <dig> by phosphorylation, was found to be more highly expressed in the spleens of fish injected with pic at 10°c and sampled at 24hpi  than in the spleens of fish injected with pic at 16°c at this time point. it is likely that the differential up-regulation of the irfs and tbk <dig> in fish stimulated with pic at the different temperatures contributed to the global expression profiles  depicted in figures

once type i interferons  are expressed, they interact with specific cell surface receptors  triggering the expression of ifn stimulated genes 
 <cit> . this signaling cascade occurs partly through the dimerization of the signal transducer and activator of transcription   <dig> and  <dig> proteins and their interaction with irf <dig>  the stat1/stat2/irf <dig> complex then further induces stat <dig> expression
 <cit> . in cod, stat <dig> mrna was previously identified as being significantly more highly expressed in the brains of fish with a high nodavirus carrier status compared to fish with no/low nodavirus; stat <dig> mrna was also shown to be significantly up-regulated in cod brain  <dig> and 72 h after ip injection with pic
 <cit> . in the current study we found that: 1) at 6hpi stat <dig> was only up-regulated in fish injected with pic at 16°c; 2) as with the irfs at 24hpi, both pic-injected groups showed significant stat <dig> mrna up-regulation; and 3) the stat <dig> qpcr-detected up-regulation was more pronounced in the 10°c pic-injected fish and sampled at 24hpi  . this suggests that the modulation of the expression of irfs at the mrna level could have affected the production of type i ifn, and together with the observed stat <dig> transcript expression profiles may also have contributed to the global gene expression profiles depicted in figures

genes with putative functions as immune effectors
the shift in the timing of the transcriptome response to pic between fish stimulated at 10°c vs. 16°c  was also observed for several immune effector genes . of the genes studied with qpcr, il- <dig> transcript expression is known to be under the control of nf-κb in mammals as evidenced by marked reductions in its expression in ikkε−/− mouse cells
 <cit>  . in the present work, il- <dig> transcript was 11-fold significantly more highly expressed in the spleens of pic injected fish held at 16°c and sampled at 6hpi compared with 16°c pbs controls. further, at 24hpi, il- <dig> mrna was 91-fold up-regulated in the spleens of pic-injected fish held at 10°c, but only ~ 7-fold up-regulated in the spleens of pic-injected fish held at 16°c, compared with the time- and temperature-matched pbs controls . two of the genes identified in the microarray study and subjected to qpcr validation are known isgs: isg <dig> and rsad <dig> 
 <cit> . these genes were previously reported to be pic-responsive in the cod spleen
 <cit>  and significantly up-regulated in the brains of cod by asymptomatic high nodavirus carrier state and ip pic treatment
 <cit> . it is not surprising that, in the current study, these genes presented the same mrna expression profiles as the irfs . for example, isg <dig> was ~  <dig> fold significantly more highly expressed in 16°c pic injected fish at 6hpi and  <dig>  fold more highly expressed in 10°c pic-injected fish sampled at 24hpi when compared to the respective time-matched pic injected fish . further, rsad <dig> mrna was  <dig> -fold significantly more highly expressed in 16°c pic-injected fish at 6hpi compared to 10°c pic-injected cod at 6hpi and  <dig>  fold significantly more highly expressed in 10°c pic-injected fish at 24hpi compared to 16°c pic-injected fish at the same time point. however, unlike what was observed for il- <dig>  the peak fold-change in pic-stimulated fish for isg <dig> and rsad <dig> mrna expression  was similar for 16°c fish at 6hpi as compared with 10°c cod at  <dig> hpi .

scya123
 <cit>  and sacs
 <cit>  have both been previously identified as up-regulated by pic in cod, and as expected both scya <dig> and sacs were significantly up-regulated in the spleen of cod injected with pic at  <dig> and 16°c . however, little is known about the roles of these proteins in the anti-viral response. scya <dig> is a small inducible cytokine, but phylogenetic clustering indicates that it is most related to the ccl <dig> group
 <cit>  of higher vertebrates. in mammals, the ccl <dig> chemokines are constitutively expressed and thought to have a minor role in immunity . nonetheless, it is clear that scya <dig> transcripts are up-regulated by pic and other antigens  in the spleen of cod
 <cit> , and therefore, at least in this species, have some role in finfish immunity. mutations in the sacs gene lead to the human disease spastic ataxia of charlevoix-saguenay
 <cit> , and it is known that the very large sacsin protein  encoded by sacs possesses heat shock protein -like atpase domains and hsp-like activity
 <cit> . however, the function of this gene in immunity remains unclear
 <cit> . sacs mrna was shown by qpcr to be up-regulated by asymptomatic high nodavirus carrier state and ip pic treatment in brains of cod
 <cit>  and by isa  virus infection in salmonid to cells
 <cit> . moreover, scya <dig> and sacs presented mrna expression profiles similar to other known immune-related genes reported here . interestingly, the transcript expression profiles of scya <dig> and sacs at 6hpi were more similar to those of il- <dig> and rsad <dig> but at 24hpi was more similar to that of isg <dig>  therefore, it is possible that these genes share some of their regulatory mechanisms, and they likely play important roles in atlantic cod responses to viruses.

cellular response to stress and innate immunity
the mild increase in temperature alone did not cause up-regulation of the genes considered to be part of the conserved cellular stress response . in contrast, several chaperone-like genes were more highly expressed at 24hpi in the fish injected with pic at 16°c compared to fish injected with pic at 10°c. in fact, at this time point  <dig> go terms related to protein folding  were significantly enriched in the list of genes up-regulated by pic at 16°c when compared to the list of genes up-regulated by pic at 10°c. in the microarray experiment, chaperone-like genes such as hsp90-alpha, hsp90-beta, hsc <dig>  hsp <dig>  peptidyl-prolyl-isomerase a, cct <dig> and cct <dig>  were identified as either being induced by pic at 24hpi in fish injected at 16°c but not in fish injected at 10°c, or significantly more highly expressed at the mrna level in the pic@16°c fish at 24hpi when compared to the pic@10°c . many of these genes  were previously identified as heat shock-responsive in the cod liver
 <cit>  and in a multiple-tissue rna-seq study in rainbow trout
 <cit> . this suggests that even though heat alone did not elicit a robust cellular stress response, the combination of heat and pic injection did induce molecular biomarkers of cellular stress.

there is evidence from the mammalian literature that hsps play a key role in modulating the innate immune response
 <cit> . interestingly at 24hpi, the go terms “regulation of interferon-gamma-mediated-signaling”, “regulation of signaling process”, “regulation of signal transduction”, and “regulation of cytokine-mediated signaling pathway” were significantly over-represented in the list of genes up-regulated by pic at 16°c compared to those up-regulated by pic at 10°c. these go terms were largely associated with probes representing hsp90-like transcripts or hsp <dig>  it is known that, at least in higher vertebrates, the cellular response to stress prevents innate immune signaling
 <cit> , and these effects are to some extent mediated by hsps. it is possible that the significantly reduced magnitude of induction by pic observed for some immune-relevant genes  in atlantic cod held at 16°c and sampled at 24hpi compared with pic-injected fish held at 10°c and sampled at 24hpi may have been a result of the activation of the cellular stress response in these animals prior to the 24hpi time point.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we used microarrays, followed by qpcr, to investigate the interaction between a moderate temperature increase and the innate immune response of cod after pic stimulation. this is the first time, to our knowledge, that the global gene expression analysis has been used to investigate the interaction between changes in environmental conditions and the antiviral immune response of this commercially important species. we have been able to demonstrate that a moderate increase in seawater temperature, similar to those experienced by farmed atlantic cod in sea-cages in newfoundland during the summer, causes a massive shift in the spleen transcriptome response to a viral mimic. furthermore, we present evidence to suggest that these changes may be, in part, regulated by changes in signal transduction  and by interactions between the cellular stress response and the innate immune response. collectively, this new information enhances our understanding of the interactions between temperature and the atlantic cod immune system, and will be valuable in global efforts to improve cod aquaculture practices and broodstock.
