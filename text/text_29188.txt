BACKGROUND
tight junctions, known as the zonula occludens, form an anastomosing network of protein and lipid strands that apically circumscribe every luminal cell of an epithelium. classically, they form a continuous and selective barrier to paracellular solute flux and ionic current  and help maintain the distinct lipid and protein composition of the apical and basolateral cellular membranes . it is becoming increasingly clear that this structure is also the direct or indirect target of many pathogens including hepatitis c virus  <cit> , coxsackie virus  <cit> , clostridium perfringens endotoxin  <cit> , enteropathogenic e. coli  <cit> , campylobacter jejuni  <cit>  and others  <cit>  and that the tight junction protein occludin is often involved in host-pathogen interactions that result in infection.

the tight junction is a complex and multifunctional structure consisting of integral membrane molecules, occludin, claudins and junction adhesion molecule. occludin and the claudins are tetraspanin proteins with two extracellular loops and are considered to form the variable permeability barrier between the luminal and interstitial spaces separated by the epithelium. tight junction plaque proteins such as zo <dig>  zo <dig>  and zo <dig>  <cit>  link the integral proteins to the actin cytoskeleton. they also interact with a diverse group of signaling molecules that connect tight junction function to paracellular permeability, cell division, cell polarity and tumorigenesis  <cit> . the focus of this paper, occludin, is a tetraspanin protein with four transmembrane domains, intracellular n and c termini and two extracellular loops . although occludin has been shown to be important in establishing and maintaining the physiological properties of the tight junction  <cit> , and appears to be important for survival of cultured hepatocytes  <cit> , the occludin-null mouse is viable and appears to have relatively minor alterations in epithelial function  <cit> . the claudins are now considered to play the major role in tight junction formation and adhesion  <cit> . importantly for this work, interference with occludin either by overexpression of a truncated form  <cit>  or with peptides that disrupt its cell recognition complex  <cit>  has been shown to alter endothelial or epithelial permeability. more recently enteropathogenic e. coli have been shown to alter occludin localization in t <dig> epithelial cells and to bring about caspase mediated apoptosis  <cit> . intriguingly, overexpression of occludin in a variety of tumor cells sensitized the cells to apoptosis inducing agents  <cit>  and occludin negative clones showed reduced ability to extrude apoptotic cells from mdck monolayers  <cit> . thus there is conflicting evidence suggesting that occludin both enhances cell survival  <cit>  and participates in reactions leading to apoptosis  <cit> . the work presented here suggests that occludin can have an important direct interaction with the extrinsic apoptotic pathway in the mammary epithelium.

turnover of epithelial cells is a normal part of the differentiated function of the simple epithelia that line most mucosal surfaces; it has been best studied in the intestine and mammary gland. the intestinal monolayer is in a constant state of flux with cells originating in the crypt moving to the apex of the microvillus where they undergo apoptosis without a loss of epithelial integrity  <cit> . in the mammary gland a massive wave of apoptosis in the involuting gland leads to loss of 75% of the epithelial cells within  <dig> days  <cit>  with no apparent loss of the barrier function until the process is well advanced . in a landmark paper rosenblatt  <cit>  and her colleagues showed that isolated apoptotic cells are extruded from epithelial monolayers by the formation of an actinomyosin ring in neighboring cells; this ring gradually tightens around the extruding cell in such a manner that the neighboring cells maintain their intercellular contacts. thus in epithelia the apoptotic process, called "cellular demolition" by martin and his colleagues  <cit> , occurs in a highly controlled fashion, removing apoptotic cells without a loss of epithelial integrity.

to determine whether changes in the tight junction could provide a link to extrusion and apoptosis of epithelial cells, we examined the effects of occludin disruption on mouse mammary epithelial cell monolayers with fully formed junctional complexes. we expressed truncated occludin  <cit>  by transient transfection at low efficiencies. we also treated the monolayers with a peptide that mimics four amino acids in the second extracellular loop of occludin  <cit> . both agents brought about an increase in non-junctional occludin that was associated with increased tunel staining, activation of caspases  <dig> and  <dig>  and extrusion of cells from the monolayer with no changes in transepithelial resistance . most intriguing was our finding of occludin association with the death inducing signaling complex   <cit> , suggesting that occludin itself may act as a signaling molecule that activates the extrinsic pathway of programmed cell death.

RESULTS
expression of dominant-negative occludin using a plasmid construct
in an initial experiment we examined the effects of occludin disruption by transiently transfecting cit <dig> and eph <dig> cells with plasmids expressing a flag-tagged truncated occludin, f-Δocc, as shown in figure  <dig>  figure 2a shows flag and zo <dig> co-staining of a single transfected cit <dig> cell processed  <dig> hours after transfection. the flag tag was localized with zo- <dig> at the tight junction as well as in intracellular puncta. the transfected cell is beginning to round up as is characteristic of the first step in extrusion  <cit> .

cells transfected with f-Δocc were stained for tunel and the flag tag  <dig> hours post transfection. control cells were transfected with bacterial alkaline phosphatase bearing identical flag tag and secretory peptide sequences . cells that expressed f-bap maintained normal morphology , whereas a variety of apoptotic morphologies were observed in the f-Δocc transfected cells. at  <dig> hr, 25% of control-transfected cells and 60% of f-Δocc-transfected cells were tunel positive . similar results were obtained with the eph <dig> cell line . close inspection of the stained cultures showed that the majority of f-Δocc-transfected cells were in various stages of extrusion and/or cellular demolition . in a very occasional view  an extrusion stalk could be seen extending apically from the monolayer. nuclei in these extruding cells often were tunel negative.

treatment of polarized epithelial monolayers with an occludin disrupting peptide
the next question was whether disruption of occludin by another means would produce a similar result. we utilized a peptide previously reported to disrupt tight junctions  <cit> . this peptide contained the lyhy sequence from the second extracellular loop of mouse occludin circularized for stability by oxidation of flanking cysteine residues. to confirm that this peptide disrupted the tight junction, we performed a "calcium switch" experiment on filter-grown eph <dig> cells with an initial ter of  <dig> ohms•cm <dig>  removing extracellular ca++and mg++ to disrupt intercellular junctions. after  <dig> minutes in the divalent cation depleted-medium ter was reduced to zero. cells were then switched back to normal medium containing the lyhy or control lyqy peptide . the control peptide  has a one amino acid substitution of the occludin peptide and was similarly circularized. peptides were removed after  <dig> hours. control peptide-treated cells recovered the initial ter by  <dig> hours and the ter continued to climb, reaching  <dig> ohms•cm <dig> . the occludin peptide severely retarded ter recovery during the  <dig> hours it was present in the medium , although once removed, the ter began to climb in parallel with the control.

treatment of a confluent monolayer of eph <dig> cells with  <dig> μm lyhy peptide for  <dig> hours  led to the appearance of large numbers of cells with irregular non-junctional occludin distributed in patches. higher concentrations of peptide produced severe disruption of the monolayer . because we were interested in examining effects on single cells, unless noted, experiments were conducted with  <dig> μm peptide. only an occasional cell showing a non-junctional distribution of occludin was observed in monolayers treated with the control peptide. similar results were obtained with cit <dig> and mdck cells . the next question was whether this disruption of non-junctional occludin led to apoptosis.

occludin peptide treatment increased apoptosis in polarized epithelial cell monolayers
we treated eph <dig> monolayers with the lyhy peptide for  <dig> hours then examined tunel staining by immunohistochemistry . quantitation of tunel stained cells showed that large numbers of apoptotic cells were present at  <dig> hours compared to cultures treated with the control lyqy . to be sure that occludin was the target of this reaction, we plated primary cells derived from the mammary gland of a pregnant occludin knock-out mouse obtained from m. furuse  <cit>  and obtained monolayer cultures. control cells were obtained from a wild type female. both were treated with the lyhy peptide for  <dig> hours and stained with an antibody to the effector caspase  <dig>  increased apoptosis was observed in cultures from the wild type but not the occludin-null mice, providing strong evidence that occludin is necessary for the apoptotic reaction.

the next question was whether we were dealing with the extrinsic or intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. both pathways utilize an "initiator" caspase to activate the effector caspase, caspase 3; however, both the site of the initial reaction and the initiator caspase differ between the two. in the intrinsic pathway cell stress or damage leads to release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria  <cit> . the cytochrome c seeds a remarkable "apoptosome" assembly leading to activation of the initiator caspase  <dig> which in turn activates caspase  <dig>  the external apoptotic pathway starts with activation of transmembrane death receptors such as fas, trail and others. activation of these receptors leads to binding of an adaptor protein fadd , which in turn binds and aggregates caspase  <dig>  promoting its autoactivation. activated caspase  <dig> in turn cleaves and activates pro-caspase  <dig> leading to the full apoptotic reaction. we tested the hypothesis that the pathway activated by the occludin peptide was the extrinsic pathway in two ways. we first examined activation of the initiator caspase  <dig> and the effector caspase  <dig>  costaining live cells with labeled peptides specific for the active sites of the two caspases. interestingly slightly more cells reacted with the caspase  <dig> peptide than the caspase  <dig> peptide . further, cells could be observed with activated caspase  <dig> alone but never with activated caspase  <dig> in the absence of caspase  <dig> . these results suggested that lhyh activates the death receptor pathway and that caspase  <dig> is the initiating caspase. these caspases were only slightly activated by the control peptide lyqy .

to provide a second, more rigorous test of the hypothesis that caspase  <dig> is the initiating caspase we measured the number of cells showing activation of the downstream effector caspase  <dig> during inhibition of caspase 8/ <dig>  <cit> . mature monolayers were incubated with inhibitors of caspase  <dig> and  <dig> , no inhibitor, or an inhibitor  of caspase  <dig>  the initiator caspase of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. monolayers were then treated with cyclic lyhy peptide and stained for activated caspase  <dig> . the number of cells staining for activated caspase  <dig> during caspase 8/ <dig> inhibition decreased 75%. caspase  <dig> inhibition produced a reduction of 25% or less. similar results were obtained when only the caspase  <dig> inhibitor  was used in this experiment, as expected, since mouse cells do not express caspase  <dig> . our findings provide strong evidence that internalization of the lyhy peptide with non-junctional occludin leads to activation of the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis. with this concentration of peptide cells are extruded from the monolayer with no loss of epithelial resistance .

to examine the mechanism of loss of apoptotic cells, we applied the lhyh peptide for  <dig> hours, adding the live cell probe for activated caspase  <dig> during the last hour. careful microscopic examination revealed occasional caspase  <dig> staining cells being extruded from the monolayer, complete with extrusion stalk  consistent with the extrusion mechanism shown earlier with f-Δocc.

non-junctional occludin interacts with the death-inducing signaling complex 
the question now is "what is the pathway by which the peptide leads to activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway?" we first asked where the lyhy peptide localized by treating the cell with a fitc-labeled cyclic lyhy peptide. we found that this peptide did indeed colocalize with non-junctional occludin  in contrast to the control fitc-labeled lyqy peptide, which neither caused internalization of occludin nor became enriched in regions of displaced occludin . e-cadherin distribution was not changed by the peptide  indicating that the adherens junction was not disrupted. this experiment provides evidence that the lyhy peptide interacts with occludin, but does not provide information about the nature of the "occludin patches" or their localization with respect to the polarity of the epithelial cells. the next experiments were designed to examine these issues.

colocalization of occludin and caspases with components of the death receptor pathway
because we had evidence that treatment with peptide leads rapidly to apoptosis, we stained eph <dig> cells live for activated caspases  <dig> and  <dig> after  <dig> minutes of treatment with lhyh. cells were then fixed and stained with an antibody to occludin . an intense patch of activated caspase  <dig> substantially colocalized with non-junctional occludin in two adjacent cells. one of these cells also showed activated caspase  <dig>  colocalized with caspase  <dig>  if occludin and these caspases are localized to the disc, components of the death receptor should also be present in these regions. in fact, immunostaining showed that fas and fadd are localized to the same regions as non-junctional occludin and caspase  <dig> . thus the disc appears to contain fas, fadd, and caspases  <dig> and  <dig> and occludin, suggesting death receptor activation by non-junctional occludin.

if occludin forms a true complex with the disc we should be able to immunoprecipitate it with fadd, a component of the disc. in figure 8a a band corresponding to occludin can be seen after immunoprecipitation of fadd from lyhy treated cells. this figure also shows that the proportion of occludin that can be immunoprecipitated is small and somewhat variable, figure 8b. similar results were obtained in  <dig> independent experiments.

localization of the disc aggregate
the next question is how the localization of the disc relates to the polarity of the cell. using digital confocal microscopy we examined a z-stack of images from the apex to the basal surface of the cell. to mark the apical surface cells were co-stained with an antibody to muc <dig>  a mucin localized exclusively to the apical surface of the cell . the middle images show the xy plane. the zx plane was calculated at two different positions of y, as shown by the white lines in the middle left image, and the zx images are depicted above and below the xy images. in these images activated caspase  <dig> appeared to be localized just basal to muc <dig> and the main body of occludin staining. however, there is a fuzzy projection of occludin into the region of caspase  <dig> staining as shown by the yellow band separating the red occludin and green caspase  <dig> bands in the lower left hand image. thus the disc is located apically and the occludin associated with the disc appears to be in the membrane suggesting that occludin moves through the membrane to activate the death receptor.

discussion
to examine the potential role of tight junction disruption in the controlled demolition of the epithelial cell, we used two previously published occludin-disrupting tools in three epithelial cell lines  as well as primary cultures of the mammary epithelium. we found that both a truncated occludin construct and a peptide identical to  <dig> amino acids in the second extracellular loop of occludin increased non-junctional occludin, increased activation of caspases  <dig> and  <dig>  and brought about tunel staining in treated cells. cells with these signs of apoptosis were extruded from the monolayer with no change in ter. there was no increased apoptosis in occludin null cells exposed to the peptide. at early times non-junctional occludin was localized in the disc with activated caspases  <dig> and  <dig> as well as with the death receptor fas protein and the adaptor protein fadd. it could be co-immunoprecipitated with fadd. these findings suggest that disruption of occludin leads to its displacement from the tight junction to the disc, initiating extrusion and apoptosis of the affected cell by the type i extrinsic pathway  <cit> .

expression of truncated occludin
the f-Δocc construct had been previously used as a dominant negative occludin to transfect cultured salivary cells  <cit> . these cells showed normal distribution of endogenous occludin, zo- <dig>  and jam. however, tracer flux was increased and ter decreased. this experiment differed from ours in that the salivary cells were stably transfected and constitutively expressing, surviving cells were selected. we used low concentrations of plasmid to obtain transient transfection of sparsely located cells, which then underwent apoptosis and left the monolayer. it would be of considerable interest to determine how the stably transfected monolayers were able to adapt to expression of the mutant construct.

peptides mimicking other occludin sequences
tight junction disruption via peptides containing sequences in the second extracellular loop of occludin has been previously reported  <cit> . when intact eph <dig> cell monolayers were treated with a  <dig> amino acid peptide comprising the entire second extracellular loop of chicken occludin, isolated patches of cells throughout the monolayer showed a punctate, intracellular, non-junctional distribution of occludin  <cit> . these peptide-treated cells maintained a ter above  <dig> ohms·cm <dig>  about 50% of that of controls. in another laboratory a peptide mimicking a  <dig> amino acid sequence in the second extracellular loop impeded recovery of ter and caused internalization of several tight junction transmembrane proteins following the calcium switch in human intestinal epithelial cells  <cit> . similar results were obtained with a rat  <dig> amino acid second extracellular loop mimic in a rat sertoli cell line  <cit> . in these latter two studies the peptide ended two amino acids upstream of the lyhy sequence suggesting that regions comprising peptides other than lyhy are also involved in homophilic interactions of occludin.

extrusion and ter
the finding that a large increase in apoptosis, which occurred in all studies, did not decrease the trans-epithelial resistance suggests that loss of single epithelial cells proceeds by an orderly biological process that maintains rather than disrupts the epithelial barrier. similarly, cultured monolayers of intestinal epithelial cells were able to maintain 50% of basal ter when treated with a fas crosslinking antibody that led to the loss of half of the cells in the culture in only  <dig> hours  <cit> . because we observed an actomyosin "purse string" around extruding cells in our study , the mechanism of extrusion first elucidated by rosenblatt and colleagues  <cit>  is likely used.

is displaced junctional occludin acting as a signaling molecule?
it has been known for some time that viral and bacterial pathogens can enter cells utilizing occludin and other elements of the tight junction  <cit> . in fact, greber and gustaldelli  <cit>  have called the tight junction the "achille's heel of epithelial cells in pathogen infection". our studies raise the very important question of whether signaling through disrupted occludin could provide a significant host defense against, at least moderate concentrations of, pathogens by producing controlled extrusion and apoptosis of affected cells. a recent study of the induction of epithelial cell apoptosis by enteropathogenic e. coli  is consistent with such a mechanism  <cit> . epec infection led to the cleavage of occludin and zo- <dig> and the mis-localization of these molecules. subsequently an increase in apoptosis markers was observed. we only observed full length occludin in fadd pulldowns, suggesting that the peptide in some way releases full length occludin from the tight junction freeing it to interact with apical membrane fas and fadd prior to any cleavage. this reaction contrasts with the finding that occludin prevents apoptosis in cultures of hepatic cells  <cit> . it is possible that occludin can both stabilize junctional complexes and signal to a cell that its junctional complex has been perturbed by a pathogenic agent. if so, occludin is quite a versatile molecule.

schneeberger has previously suggested that occludin might serve as a signaling molecule, although in a different context  <cit> . while the results of our studies are consistent with a role for non-junctional occludin as a signaling molecule, it is clear that many other signaling molecules are also associated with tight junctions  <cit> . any one of a number of these could transmit a signal from a disrupted tight junction to the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. an intriguing possibility is that the akt antagonist, lipid phosphatase pten  links loss of occludin function to apoptosis. several reports have demonstrated that the pten binds to the tight junction associated magi- <dig>  <cit> , par  <cit> , and dlg  <cit>  proteins and pten binding to the pdz domain of magi- <dig> promoted its stability  <cit> . moreover, pten plays a role in activation of the death receptor pathway of apoptosis under various conditions  <cit> . our preliminary results show that pten is associated with the tight junction in eph <dig> cells . it will be of interest to determine whether it plays a role in linking occludin disruption to death receptor mediated apoptosis.

future directions
the results of our experiments link disruption of the tight junction protein occludin to stimulation of apoptosis via the extrinsic pathway and provide a potential defense mechanism for ridding the epithelium of cells exposed to pathogens. they also raise questions for further experimentation: for example, does the apoptotic process involved meet criteria for type i death receptor activation other than the recruitment of large amounts of caspase  <dig> to the disc  <cit> ? interestingly, nusrat and her colleagues have proposed that the tight junctional components reside in lipid raft-like complexes  <cit> . the diffuse nature of the occludin stain in figures  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> leads us to ask whether portions of these rafts might detach from the junction and fuse with the disc, which has also been shown to localize to lipid rafts  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have found that a small cyclized peptide lyhy disrupts occludin localization at the tight junction and activates the extrinsic pathway of programmed cell death. at early times occludin is localized at the death inducing signaling complex and can be immunoprecipitated with fadd, a member of this complex. these observations suggest that occludin has a protective as well as a barrier forming role in epithelia; pathogenic agents which utilize this protein as an entry point into the cell might set off an apoptotic reaction allowing extrusion of the infected cell before the pathogen can gain entry to the interstitial space.
