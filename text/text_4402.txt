BACKGROUND
the first plant micrornas  were described by isolating, cloning, and sequencing small rna populations in arabidopsis thaliana and later in other species  <cit> . in arabidopsis and rice, mirnas and their targets have been extensively studied  <cit> .

mirnas are a class non-coding, sequence-specific and trans-acting endogenous small rnas that play very important roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation through degradation of target mrnas or by translational repression of targeted genes  <cit> . currently, more and more investigations in functional analysis of conserved mirnas reveal their involvement in multiple biological and metabolic processes in plants, including induced responses towards abiotic – and biotic stressors, by modulating the expression of their endogenous target genes  <cit> .

rna polymerase ii transcribes mirnas into long primary transcripts  that are cut into mirna precursors  with typical hairpin structures, capped with a specially modified nucleotide at the 5’ end and polyadenylated with multiple adenosines  <cit> . the pre-mirna hairpin is cleaved to generate the mature mirnas from the stem portion of the single stranded stem-loop precursor by the complex containing the nuclear rnase iii enzyme and the ribonuclease iii-like enzyme dicer   <cit> . the resulting mature mirna is inserted into the rna-induced silencing complex  that contain argonaute proteins. finally the mature mirna guides the risc to complementary mrna targets and the risc inhibits translation elongation or triggers the degradation of target mrna  <cit> .

many of the target genes of mirnas identified in plants, either computationally  or experimentally , encode regulatory proteins, indicative of the function of mirnas as important regulators for gene expression  <cit> . the discovery of the ability of mirnas to regulate gene expression suggests that this class of non-coding rnas represent one of the more abundant classes of gene regulatory molecules in plants and possibly affect the output of many protein-coding genes  <cit> .

experimental studies in arabidopsis and other plants have shown that abiotic and biotic stresses induce differential expression of a set of mirnas such as: mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  <cit> . some of their identified target genes were involved in signaling pathways and regulation of gene expression and transcription associated with the stress conditions  <cit> . recent evidence shows that mirnas are substantially implicated as molecular regulators of plant immune – and defense responses  <cit> .

plants exhibit a sophisticated molecular system for recognition of microbe-associated molecular pattern  molecules and undergoes a massive reprogramming of the transcriptome upon perception of mamps  <cit> , leading to mamp-triggered immunity . one of the prototypic model mamps used as potential inducers of plant defense responses is bacterial lipopolysaccharide , a major component of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . perception of lps leads to the activation of an array of defense genes in a. thaliana in support of innate immunity and mti  <cit> .

high-throughput  sequencing technologies have provided a powerful tool for enhancing mirna discovering and target identification in plants  <cit> . with its massively parallel throughput, this has revolutionized the analysis of microtranscriptomes for low-cost and high quality. millions of mirnas sequences can be generated and used directly for identification and profiling expression level of mirnas with a possibility to compare the expression profiles of two or more samples  <cit> .

mirnas have emerged as a potential means to obtain insight into the nature of complex regulatory networks operating during plant-microbe interactions. in this study we employed illumina sequencing technology to gain a global picture of the expression profiles of mirnas in undifferentiated cultured a. thaliana cells following the induction of defense responses using lps. the findings were subsequently extended to also include differentiated leaf tissue. this is the first microtranscriptome study, using lps as a mamp, to identify mirnas differentially expressed in a. thaliana cells and leaf tissues and their target genes. lps is only one of a cocktail of mamps that a plant might perceive upon attempted bacterial infection and as such its responses are expected to be more specific compared to the responses elicited by a combination of different mamps.

RESULTS
mirnas isolation and sequencing
in order to profile the composition and expression of arabidopsis mirnas in response to lps treatments we isolated mirna from a. thaliana callus and leaf tissues after  <dig> and 3 h post treatment. four small rna libraries  were constructed and sequenced using the illumina h-t sequencing technology. a total of  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> raw reads was generated for the callus tissues  and the leaves . after quality control and adapter trimming, a total  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> high quality clean reads was obtained . following sequence filtering on length   <dig>  <dig> reads were obtained which were then subjected to analyse their length distribution. the small rnas were in the range of  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides in both callus and leaf libraries . in terms of total sequence abundance, the class of small rna with  <dig> nucleotides length was shown to be the most abundant in both tissues. the total number of small rna sequences identified from the treated libraries was larger compared with the control libraries for both callus and leaf tissues.figure  <dig>

predicted target genes of identified mirnas
due to the importance of mirna in regulating gene expression and for better understanding of their biological mechanisms by which a. thaliana responds to lps, the putative target genes of mirnas were identified by aligning mirna sequences with the mirbase using the web-based psrnatarget program  <cit> . in the leaf tissues target genes were identified for all the identified mirnas and in the callus tissues the same, except for mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> . in a. thaliana, many of the mirna – mrna interactions have been experimentally validated. in total about  <dig> targets genes were predicted among which most of them encode transcription factors  targeted by mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  the knowledge of the target genes’ identified functions informed on the subsequent mirna studies.table  <dig>

expression profiling of mirnas identified in a. thaliana leaf and callus tissues
h-t sequencing is an efficient tool to identify mirnas and accurately measure their expression profiles especially those with low expression levels, in plants  <cit> . the expression profiles of each mirna obtained from the sequencing and expressed by read counts in each library vary from  <dig> to  <dig> in the callus tissues  and from  <dig> to  <dig> in the leaf tissues . the regulation was observed for each mirna where the log <dig> ratio of normalized expression under treatment was greater than  <dig> or less than − <dig>  <cit> . eleven mirnas were up-regulated with a log <dig> fold change range between  <dig>  and  <dig>  in the callus tissues  and four mirnas with a log <dig> fold change range between  <dig>  and  <dig>  in the leaf tissues . the expression of two mirnas was down-regulated with a log <dig> fold change less than − <dig> in both callus and leaf tissues. in the callus tissues,  <dig> mirnas were only expressed in the treated library; four mirnas in the control library and fourteen mirnas had similar expression in the two libraries with a log <dig> fold change range between − <dig> and  <dig> . in the leaf tissues,  <dig> mirnas were only expressed in the treated library; seven mirnas in the control library and nineteen mirnas had similar expression in the two libraries . the most differentially expressed mirna with a highest fold change in the callus tissue was mir <dig> and in leaf tissue, mir <dig> figure  <dig>

quantitative mirna expression analysis by real time pcr
expression analyses of nine mirnas were conducted at  <dig> and 3 h post induction to validate if the sequencing data reflected their expression. this was normalized against the u <dig> small nuclear rna to give the relative expression . the expression data was then compared against the h-t sequencing data analysis which revealed that five  of the nine mirnas in callus tissue and six  of the nine mirnas in leaf tissue showed expression patterns that were similar to those observed with the h-t sequencing data. in both callus and leaf tissues, four mirnas  were up-regulated, two mirnas  were down-regulated with two other mirnas  only found in the callus tissue . furthermore, in the callus tissue, mir <dig> and three mirnas in the leaf tissue  were not differentially expressed between the untreated and treated samples. the qpcr showed that mir <dig> was expressed but significantly down-regulated in the treated callus tissue which contrasted the results obtained by sequencing analysis, which indicated that it was not expressed in the treated callus tissue. a similar observation was done for mir <dig> in the leaf tissue. in callus and leaf tissues, mir <dig> showed the highest relative expression contrary to the sequencing analysis which indicated that the most abundant up-regulated mirnas was mir <dig>  the greatest degree of down-regulation in response to lps was shown by mir <dig> in the callus tissue.figure  <dig>

expression analysis of mirna target genes by real time pcr
to evaluate the correlations between mirna expression profiles and their target genes, we performed quantitative expression analysis of  <dig> corresponding target genes of the mirnas studied in the above section . in the callus tissue, the expression profiles of  <dig> target genes  behaved as expected , i.e. if mirna expression was up-regulated/induced then target gene expression was down regulated/repressed and vice versa. in the leaf tissue the expression profiles of six target genes  behaved as expected . in the callus tissue, in five cases  out of eight cases of expected expression profiles, where the mirna profiles had a significant p value either p <  <dig>  or p <  <dig> , the expected trend in the profile of the target gene was also significant with p value either p <  <dig>  or p <  <dig> . similar observations were made in the leaf tissue with three cases  out of six exhibiting the expected expression profile. in the callus tissue two mirnas  and their corresponding target genes  showed no agreement in their expression profile as expected. this was also the case in the leaf tissue for mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> with their corresponding target genes; squamosa promoter-binding-like protein, myb domain protein  <dig> and ubiquitin-protein ligase respectively.figure  <dig>

discussion
current indications predict a multifaceted role for mirnas in plant innate immune responses, from pathogen recognition to modulating hormone responses and coordinating expression of defense genes  <cit> . mirnas can act as both positive and negative regulators of plant immune responses, either alone or in combination with regulatory proteins where they contribute to key regulatory checkpoints modulating both mti and eti  <cit> . however, the networks involved in mirnas, mrna and plant hormone signaling is still unclear. it has been noticed that different mirnas can target the same gene but their expression pattern varies with the type of plant and pathogen under study  <cit> . in addition, it is unknown whether or not mirnas function the same way in vivo because the expression pattern, timing, and cellular location may differ among mirnas and their targets.

although mirna biogenesis is important for establishment of mti, mirna species involved in this process have not been fully explored  <cit> . here, small rna sequencing was done to obtain an overview of the effect of lps elicitation on the microtranscriptome of a. thaliana leaf and callus tissues. in addition, some of the effects were further investigated and verified by the more sensitive qpcr technique  <cit> . it was reported  that h-t sequencing data and qpcr-based assays may give different measures of the same transcript in the same biological sample. like-wise, it can happen that two mirnas with similar numbers of sequencing reads may in fact differ substantially in their absolute abundances in a sample  <cit> . mirnas have also been shown to have variable expression patterns with regard to tissue differentiation and developmental stages  <cit> .

in this study, a total of  <dig> highly conserved plant mirnas were identified in both callus and leaf tissues of arabidopsis. some of the stress-responsive mirna families are deeply conserved among various plant species  <cit> . the class of small rnas of  <dig> nucleotides was the most abundant class of mirna identified , consistent with previous findings where small rnas of  <dig> nucleotides were predominant in plant microtranscriptomes  <cit> . in addition to small rna sequencing and identification, illumina sequencing technology as performed in previous reports  <cit> , also measured the expression patterns of each identified mirna in response to lps . the deep coverage of mature mirnas obtained allowed us to compare the normalized number of counts of each mirna in a treated library to that in the untreated library to find mirnas that were up-regulated or down-regulated . most of the identified mirnas from treated samples exhibited higher expression compared to the untreated samples, revealing evidence of the effect of lps on the microtranscriptome of a. thaliana leaf and callus tissues.

mirnas are critical key regulators of gene expression as they respond rapidly to stress by regulating the existing pool of mrnas  <cit> . their putative targets were predicted using the web-based psrnatarget program . the identification of target mrnas, together with the significance of their regulation by mirnas, are key contributors to understanding the biological response. previous studies showed that mirnas induced under stress conditions are generally expected to target negative regulators of stress responses or positive regulators of processes inhibited by stresses. moreover, mirnas down-regulated by stress are predicted to repress the expression of stress-inducible genes and/or positive regulators  <cit> . in this study, the major group of predicted target genes are tfs, themselves controllers of gene expression. some of those predicted tfs , etc.) are regulated by the identified mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> .

the sequencing revealed that mir <dig> was up-regulated with a  <dig>  fold change in the treated callus tissue and without any expression change in the leaf tissue . the expression profile was validated with the qpcr which indicated an up-regulation in both callus and leaf tissues with a fold change of  <dig>  and  <dig>  . a target gene for this mirna encodes squamosa promoter binding like protein . the spl gene family belongs to a group of plant-specific zinc finger protein genes that encodes tfs known to be involved in responses to abiotic - and biotic stresses, and the activation of other tfs  <cit> . the expression profile of spl measured by qpcr showed a significant down-regulation in both callus and leaf tissues . this indicates that the up-regulation of mir <dig>  leading to lower levels of spl, would enhance the a. thaliana response to lps.

the h-t sequencing showed that the expression of mir <dig> was up-regulated in the treated callus tissue and without any expression change in the leaf tissue . qpcr validated the expression observed in the leaf tissue but a contrasting down-regulation was found in the callus tissue . mir <dig> primarily regulate signal transduction and development of plants under various stress conditions  <cit> . the target for this mirna encodes myb domain protein  <dig>  which was shown by qpcr to be down-regulated in both tissues . this observation led us to consider the expression profile of mir <dig> revealed by the h-t sequencing result rather than the one revealed by the qpcr. a previous study by reyes and chua  <cit>  found mir <dig> also to be induced in arabidopsis in response to infection with pseudomonas syringae. consequently, mir <dig> mediates cleavage of myb <dig> and myb <dig> transcripts, which encode positive regulators of abscisic acid  responses. this was hypothesised to activate the salicylic acid  signaling pathway in turn, to promote sa-mediated defense responses  <cit> . similarly, our data could imply that mir <dig> influences hormone signaling pathways to trigger defense responses to lps but this need to be confirmed with further investigation.

the similar down-regulated pattern observed for spl and myb <dig> could be correlated to the co-expression network study of wang et al.  <cit>  who demonstrated that spl genes can activate other tf families  and form a complex control network. in line with previous findings on stress-regulated mirnas in arabidopsis and rice  <cit> , the up-regulated expression of mir <dig> and mir <dig> may lead to the repression of their predicted target tfs which would lead to the activation of defense pathways in response to lps perception.

mir <dig> was induced in both callus and leaf tissues as revealed by the h-t sequencing results  and the expression profile was validated by qpcr which showed significant up-regulation in both tissues . mir <dig> expression is induced in rice and arabidopsis under drought  <cit>  and salt stress  <cit>  and down-regulation of their target genes resulted in tolerance to these environmental stresses. the target for this mirna encodes the nuclear factor y family , a group of tfs that have three distinct subunits  that bind to the ccaat box  <cit> . the qpcr revealed that in both tissues the expression of the nuclear factor y family transcript was significantly down-regulated . based on these reports and from the qpcr results, the up-regulation of mir <dig>  by decreasing the levels of the nuclear factor y family, might contribute to the lps-induced responses in a. thaliana since the down-regulation of some genes could also be very important for plants to overcome abiotic/biotic stresses.

the mir <dig> was down-regulated due to lps elicitation in the leaf tissue and was not differentially expressed in the callus tissue according to the h-t sequencing result . qpcr revealed that it was significantly down-regulated in both tissues . mir <dig> targets many genes which encode pentatricopeptide repeat  family proteins, as well as fucosyl transferase genes encoding glycosyl transferases for cell wall xyloglucan biosynthesis. pprs are putative rna binding proteins involved in rna processing, metabolism, editing or translation  <cit> . although the fact that their function in plant pathogen resistance remains to be explored  <cit> , the down-regulation of their regulated mirna, may have contributed to increase the response of a. thaliana triggered by lps.

another category of stress-responsive mirnas identified in this study is mir <dig> which was shown to be induced in both callus and leaf tissues following lps treatment . mirna <dig> was reported to positively induce flg <dig> induced callose deposition  <cit> . furthermore, mir <dig> was highly induced in arabidopsis leaves collected at  <dig> and 3 h post-inoculation with the hrcc mutant of p. syringae pv. tomato, dc <dig>  <cit> . mir <dig> regulates genes involved in the auxin signaling pathway, including auxin response factors and auxin receptors. arfs are known to bind auxin-response elements and either activate or repress gene expression  <cit> . the qpcr revealed that in both tissues the expression of arf  <dig> was significantly down-regulated . many biotrophic pathogens can synthesize auxin or auxin-like molecules to promote virulence. as a result, host plants have developed several counter measures, including mirna-mediated gene regulation, to suppress auxin signaling and subsequently inhibit pathogen growth  <cit> . our results imply that the up-regulation of mir <dig>  by decreasing the levels of arf  <dig>  might contribute to enhance a. thaliana responses induced by lps.

the expression profile of mir <dig> was repressed in the leaf tissue as shown by the h-t sequencing results  but no single read was detected in the callus tissue. however, the more sensitive qpcr confirmed the expression profile of mir <dig> by revealing a slight down-regulation in the leaf tissue and a significant down-regulation of  <dig>  fold in the callus tissue . this observation was in contrast with the study of navarro et al.  <cit>  who reported that arabidopsis mir <dig> expression was induced with a two fold increase following treatment with flg <dig>  this might be due to the different chemical structures of flg <dig> vs. lps and different mechanisms of perception. mir <dig> was reported to regulate auxin signaling and defense response by targeting tir <dig>   which represses auxin signaling and enhances bacterial disease resistance  <cit> . in this study, target prediction revealed that mir <dig> targets genes which encode concanavalin a-like lectin protein kinase family proteins. the qpcr indicated, with the expected trend in the expression profile, that the concanavalin a-like lectin protein kinase was significantly up-regulated in both tissues with a  <dig>  fold change in the leaf tissue . in addition, the lectin receptor-like protein kinase  , only quantified by qpcr in the callus tissue, showed a significant up-regulation . in addition to plant growth and development, lecrlks play crucial roles in adaptive responses to various abiotic and biotic stressors  <cit> , and might act as inducible receptors for recognition of extracellular carbohydrate-based mamps like lps  <cit> . the down-regulation of mir <dig> and up-regulation of the corresponding lecrlk target gene indicates that this could be part of enhancing the perception capabilities of a. thaliana cells exposed to lps.

another lps-responsive, stress-regulated mirna identified in this study is mir <dig>  known to target growth regulating factors   <cit> . mir <dig> was up-regulated in the callus tissue and down-regulated in the leaf tissue according to the h-t sequencing results . in contrast, qpcr revealed a down-regulation of mir <dig> in the callus tissue and no differential expression in the leaf tissue . tissue differentiation  <cit>  could explain this variation in the expression profile of mir <dig> in the two tissue types. consequently, the qpcr showed that the grf- <dig>  target of mir <dig>  was significantly up-regulated in both callus and leaf tissues . these results correlated with the expression patterns of mir <dig> given by the qpcr in the callus tissue and h-t sequencing result obtained in the leaf tissue. in this regard, the increase of the expression of the grf- <dig> by the reduction of mir <dig> expression suggests the involvement of this grf in the a. thaliana response to the lps elicitation. this is supported by recent data that the grf tfs are also involved in biotic stress responses and may play a role in coordinating the interaction between developmental processes and defense dynamics  <cit> .

the h-t sequencing results showed that mir <dig> was only expressed in the callus tissue  but the qpcr revealed that it was not differentially expressed in both tissues . a putative target of mir <dig> encodes ubiquitin-protein ligase  <cit> . the qpcr of ubiquitin-protein ligase showed complete repression in the leaf tissue and an up-regulation in the callus tissue . during plant-pathogen interactions proteins that function as negative regulators of defense are targeted and degraded  <cit> . since ubiquitin-protein ligase plays a role in this process  <cit> , our data suggests that it may be similarly involved in the response of a. thaliana cells towards lps.

we found that mir <dig>  proposed to be directly linked to the plant stress regulatory network, was up-regulated in both tissues as shown by the h-t sequencing  and the expression pattern was validated by the qpcr which revealed a significant up-regulation in both tissues . in arabidopsis, prior studies demonstrated that mir <dig> is involved in responses to abiotic - and biotic stresses and it targets at least four mrnas which include the cytosolic copper/zinc superoxide dismutase <dig> , the chloroplastic csd <dig>  a subunit of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase, cox5b- <dig>  and the copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase  <cit> . the significant down-regulation of csd revealed by the qpcr in both tissues  indicated a role for mir398-mediated gene regulation in response to lps. csds limits the formation of reactive oxygen species  and institute their removal. during plants’ early response to pathogen invasion, ros are required to trigger the overall response system that includes the hypersensitive response and defense gene activation  <cit> . the repression of the csd by the overexpression of mir <dig> might thus be required to enhance a. thaliana’s response to lps perception.

similarly, mir <dig> was induced in both callus and leaf tissues as revealed by the h-t sequencing  and the expression profile was validated by the qpcr which showed that it was significantly up-regulated in both tissues . mir <dig> has been reported as a negative regulator of plantacyanins  <cit>  and the qpcr of plantacyanin showed a significant down-regulation in both tissues . plantacyanins  have been proposed to function in cell-to-cell signaling, stress responses and involved in redox reactions occurring during primary defense responses  <cit> , but functional characterization is hindered by the complexity of redox processes in biological systems. the regulation of genes encoding copper proteins by mir <dig> and mir <dig> suggests a link between copper homeostasis and its contribution to the activation of the a. thaliana response to lps through mechanisms that are as yet unknown.

in addition, the sequencing results also revealed that various other stress-regulated mirnas were expressed in response to lps which include: mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  these have previously been found to be regulated in a. thaliana seedlings exposed to cold stress, dehydration, high salinity, nitrogen deficiency and the stress hormone abscisic acid  <cit> ; and in other plants such as rice, populus and tobacco  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
multifaceted roles for mirnas as molecular regulators during plant immune – and defense responses have been proposed  <cit> . illumina h-t sequencing technology and qrt-pcr allowed us to gain a global perspective of the expression profiles of mirnas in a. thaliana leaf and callus tissues following the perception of lps. in callus tissues  <dig> mirnas, belonging to  <dig> mirna families and in leaf tissues,  <dig> mirnas belonging to  <dig> mirna families were identified and their target genes predicted. the results revealed evidence of the effect of lps on the microtranscriptome of a. thaliana leaf and callus tissues, resulting in dynamic changes and differential re-programming . together with the effects on their corresponding target genes, this indicates some of the early events leading up to mti.figure  <dig>

these observations add insights to our previous contributions regarding lps as a trigger of the expression of a broad range of defense-associated genes in a. thaliana  <cit> . the findings presented here reflect a novel view of lps as a potent mamp and potential plant-priming agent, revealing that a. thaliana exhibit a molecular system for recognition and sensing lps  <cit>  which in turn differentially regulate a subset of stress-regulated mirnas. taken together, all of the lps-responsive mirnas target several stress-related genes, including some encoding tfs and signal generating proteins, at one time. in turn, each target gene is potentially involved in the regulation of downstream biochemical processes, implying regulation and crosstalk of gene expression.

our study thus provides valuable information to understand the function of mirnas in the regulation of plant responses to a biotic stress in general and lps/mamp perception in particular. the results also contribute significantly to increase the knowledge about how mirnas are utilised to reprogram cellular metabolism upon perception of mamps during pathogen attack.
