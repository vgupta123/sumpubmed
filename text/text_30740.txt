BACKGROUND
temperatures are known to vary considerably at aquaculture cage-sites  <cit>  and can approach upper critical temperatures  for atlantic cod . these changes can occur both rapidly   <cit>  and seasonally. fish confined to cages cannot completely avoid these temperatures and therefore are likely to be exposed to stressful conditions  <cit> . the stress response consists of numerous modifications to an organism's physiology and behaviour that are necessary to regain and maintain homeostasis once it has been challenged by changes in the environment, e.g. changes in temperature  <cit> . the cellular response to stress is the coordinated reaction to a threat of macromolecular damage and protects the cell against the potentially hazardous consequences of such events  <cit> . cortisol is often regarded as a suitable indicator of stress, and one of the key hormones regulating the stress response  <cit> . most actions of cortisol are thought to be mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor , which upon binding to the hormone, moves into the nucleus and acts as a transcription factor that interacts with specific promoter regions known as glucocorticoid responsive elements   <cit> . stress can therefore have a significant impact on the transcription of specific genes. thermal stress is also known to alter the transcription of a variety of genes including those encoding proteins that are involved in the response to oxidative stress, apoptosis, protein folding, energy metabolism, protein synthesis, membrane fluidity and immune function  <cit> . the proteins encoded by these transcripts include some of the elements that comprise and/or regulate both the organismal and cellular stress responses, and may help to protect the animal against the deleterious effects of stress. among these are chaperones , anti-oxidative enzymes  and enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism .

transcriptomic studies have been used to investigate the impacts of environmental stress on several organisms including fish  <cit> . specifically, suppression subtractive hybridization  libraries have been used to identify fish genes that are responsive to diverse stimuli such as polyriboinosinic polyribocytidylic acid  injection  <cit> , formalin-killed atypical aeromonas salmonicida injection  <cit> , osmotic stress  <cit> , cadmium  <cit> , and pesticide exposure  <cit> . in order to better characterize the genes and molecular pathways involved in the atlantic cod response to heat-shock, we constructed, sequenced, and characterized reciprocal ssh libraries enriched for transcripts dysregulated by heat-shock. candidate heat-shock responsive cod cdnas identified in the libraries were further investigated using real-time quantitative reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction . this report is the first to use high-throughput genomic techniques  to characterize the transcriptomic response of atlantic cod to thermal stress. this study is part of the genome canada funded atlantic cod genomics and broodstock development project , which is developing many tools to study stress physiology in this species. a better understanding of changes in atlantic cod gene transcription in response to heat-shock will potentially lead to new tools and techniques  for studying the impacts of environmental stress on cod, and for selecting individuals  that can tolerate higher water temperatures.

RESULTS
plasma cortisol levels
plasma cortisol did not change significantly in the undisturbed control  group over the course of the experiment, averaging  <dig>  -  <dig>  ng ml- <dig> . in contrast, plasma cortisol levels were significantly  increased in the "transferred but not heat-shocked control"  and heat-shocked  groups at the cessation of the  <dig> hour heat-shock  when compared to their levels at the before heat-shock  time point . at this time point , average plasma cortisol levels in the heat-shocked group  were  <dig> -fold higher than for the ct group  and  <dig> -fold higher than for the hs bhs values  . plasma cortisol in fish that were only transferred to a new tank at 10°c  returned to basal levels  at  <dig> hours after the cessation of heat-shock . in contrast, cortisol in the heat-shocked fish reached its highest level at this time-point , and remained significantly elevated at  <dig>  and  <dig>  hours after the cessation of heat-shock; values at these time-points were  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold higher than those measured in bhs fish, respectively.

characterization of ssh libraries and identification of candidate heat-shock responsive transcripts
we constructed and characterized  <dig> forward ssh libraries  and  <dig> reverse ssh library . the ssh library method requires  <dig> μg of poly + rna   <cit> , and mrna usually only represents 1-5% of total rna. in order to obtain adequate quantities of mrna for ssh library construction, we isolated mrna from pooled total rna samples . for ssh library construction, mrna from heat-shocked   fish were subtracted against mrna from tissues of control transferred  fish that were subjected to a handling stress  but without heat-shock. the mrna used for ssh library construction consisted of samples taken at the cessation of the stressor and throughout the recovery period . the resulting ssh libraries were enriched for transcripts that were dysregulated by the combined handling and heat-shock, but not those transcripts that were dysregulated by handling stress alone. we used three tissues to facilitate the identification of cod transcripts that were stress responsive across tissues, and therefore likely to be linked to the organism's overall sensitivity or resistance to thermal stress. we built reciprocal ssh libraries to identify transcripts that were up-regulated by heat-shock  as well as transcripts that were down-regulated by heat-shock . we sequenced a total of  <dig> expressed sequence tags :  <dig> from the liver forward library,  <dig> from the head kidney forward library,  <dig> from the skeletal muscle forward library, and  <dig> from the liver reverse library. although reverse ssh libraries were also made for the head kidney and skeletal muscle, initial complexity evaluation and/or sequencing showed that they were of low complexity , and they were therefore not subjected to deeper sequencing . the ests were assembled into contiguous sequences  using paracel transcript assembler  and annotated using autofact  <cit> . selected defense  relevant sequences are presented in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  in these tables, we do not include contigs and singletons with blastx hit e-values above 10- <dig>  as well as many sequences that are unclassified , redundant, or with blast hits that have non-stress related functional annotations. a complete list of assembled sequences , ests contributing to contigs, est accession numbers, associated autofact hit descriptions  and functional annotations, can be found in additional file  <dig>  and additional file  <dig> .

1agarose gel electrophoresis of the muscle reverse library revealed the presence of  <dig> clear bands, which indicated a low-complexity library. therefore, sequencing of this library was not attempted.

2the forward ssh libraries were constructed to be enriched for genes that were up-regulated by heat-shock, and the reverse ssh libraries were constructed to be enriched for genes that were down-regulated by heat-shock.

4the ests were trimmed with phred  <cit>  with the trim_alt and trim_cutoff fixed at  <dig> , followed by the removal of known contaminant sequences and short sequences , and the average est length was calculated based on edited sequences.

5sequences generated were then clustered using paracel transcript assembler , with the cluster threshold set at  <dig> for relatively stringent clustering.

6the  <dig> largest contigs in this library  were annotated as haemoglobins and contained  <dig> sequences, which represented almost 50% of the good sequences obtained for it. thus, this library was deemed low-complexity and not sequenced further.

haemoglobin subunit alpha- <dig> was the largest contig  in the head kidney forward library , and haemoglobin subunit beta- <dig> was the largest contig  in the liver forward library . in the skeletal muscle forward library the largest contig was parvalbumin  . in order to identify and validate transcripts that were up-regulated in response to heat-shock, we looked in the forward libraries for cod cdnas that: a) had significant blastx hits  against proteins with stress-relevant functional annotations; b) were in contigs in more than one forward library; and/or c) had a relatively large number of contributing sequences . a list of selected contigs from the forward libraries, with detailed blastx statistics and functional annotations, is presented in table  <dig>  these include several cod cdnas with blastx hits against putative chaperone or chaperone-related proteins, including the following: the translationally-controlled tumor protein  ; heat shock protein  <dig>  ; several putative members of the t-complex containing chaperonin system  including chaperonin containing tcp <dig>  subunit  <dig>  , t-complex protein  <dig> subunit beta  , t complex  <dig>   and tcp1-theta  ; heat shock protein  <dig> alpha  ; heat shock protein  <dig> kda beta, member  <dig>  ; hsp70- <dig>  ; and the  <dig> kda glucose-regulated protein  .

expression of candidate heat-shock responsive transcripts
we used qpcr to validate and further study the effects of heat-shock on  <dig> ssh-identified atlantic cod transcripts. while ssh libraries were constructed using pooled mrna samples, qpcr was conducted using individual rna templates to assess biological variability. eight cod cdna sequences selected for qpcr had significant blastx hits against proteins with chaperone functions ,  <dig> had significant blastx hits against proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism ,  <dig> were identified as immune-relevant transcripts ,  <dig> was most similar at the predicted amino acid level to an acute phase protein  and  <dig> cdna was identified as the transcript for a gene involved in regulation of the cell cycle . the numbers of contributing sequences and libraries where these transcripts were found are detailed in tables  <dig> and  <dig> 

of the  <dig> cdnas arising from the forward libraries and analyzed with qpcr , all of those encoding proteins with putative chaperone function with the exception of tctp were shown to be significantly up-regulated at the mrna level by heat-shock in at least one tissue and at least one time point post heat-shock . tctp mrna levels were responsive to handling alone  in the head kidney, with an average fold down-regulation of  <dig>  and  <dig>  at cs and at 3acs, respectively. we also found that hsp70- <dig>  and grp <dig>  transcripts responded significantly to handling alone in the liver. hsp70- <dig> mrna was significantly up-regulated by an average of  <dig> -fold at 12acs in the ct group when compared to the values for bhs fish, while grp <dig> mrna was significantly down-regulated by an average of ~ <dig> -fold at all time points in the same group. these two transcripts showed no response to handling alone in the other tissues studied. of the cdnas with significant blastx hits against proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism, enolase mrna expression was significantly responsive to handling alone in only a single tissue , but was not significantly responsive to heat-shock. pfk and aldolase presented no significant differences between groups or time points .

the genes with the highest significant mrna up-regulation in response to heat-shock were hsp90α ; hsp70- <dig> ; grp <dig> ; and hsp <dig> . of the  <dig> transcripts significantly up-regulated by heat-shock that were identified in the forward libraries , only two transcripts  were not significantly up-regulated  in all  <dig> tissues tested. within the tissues, hsp90α mrna presented the greatest fold up-regulation in liver  and skeletal muscle , while grp <dig> mrna presented the highest fold up-regulation in the head kidney . the transcripts with significant up-regulation in response to heat-shock also showed differences in timing of expression in the three tissues studied. as previously stated, hsp90α mrna expression in the liver peaked relative to the bhs time point at cs . however, many stress-relevant transcripts had significant maximum fold up-regulation at 3acs relative the bhs time point. these were: hsp90α in the skeletal muscle ; grp <dig> in all tissues ; grp <dig> in all tissues ; hsp <dig> in the liver ; and cct <dig>  and cct <dig>  both in the liver. transcripts for hsp90α in the head kidney , hsp <dig> in the skeletal muscle and head kidney , and hsp70- <dig> in all tissues  had maximum significant mrna fold up-regulation at 12acs relative to the bhs time point. the timing and magnitude of the changes in expression of transcripts for hsp90α , hsp <dig> , and grp <dig>  also varied between different tissues. for example, hsp90α transcript was maximally up-regulated at cs in the liver but at 3acs in the skeletal muscle relative to the bhs time point.

from the  <dig> cdnas selected for qpcr studies from the reverse liver library , nupr <dig> and tlr <dig> were the only cod transcripts that responded significantly to heat-shock. the transcript levels for tlr <dig> were down-regulated by an average of  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold in the hs group in the head kidney at cs and 3acs, respectively, when compared to the levels at the bhs time point . interestingly, nupr <dig> transcripts were significantly up-regulated by heat-shock at cs in both liver  and head kidney , and at 3acs the hs group still showed significantly higher levels of nupr <dig> transcript than in the ct group in both tissues . bikunin and igm mrnas displayed similar responses in ct and hs groups  and il- <dig> mrna showed no significant changes . bikunin transcripts in the liver and head kidney were reduced by both stressors. they were significantly lower in the ct group in the liver at 3acs when compared to levels at the bhs time point, and in the head kidney from hs fish when compared to those from the ct group at the cs time-point .

discussion
thermal stress can pose a significant challenge to cod at aquaculture cage sites as summer temperatures may approach the upper critical thermal limit for this species and/or change rapidly during the day  <cit> . heat-stress is known to cause many physiological changes in cod including the release of stress hormones , changes in the expression of immune relevant transcripts, alterations in oxygen consumption and heart rate, and increased mortality  <cit> . therefore, a better understanding of the mechanisms mediating the response to thermal stress should provide insights into how to mitigate and/or avoid the deleterious effect of such environmental challenges. we observed a significant elevation in average plasma cortisol in both control transferred  and heat-shocked  cod at cs; plasma cortisol in hs fish was  <dig> -fold higher than in ct fish at the cs time point, and  <dig> -fold higher in hs when compared to ct at 3acs. further, cortisol levels in hs fish remained elevated during the recovery period. in contrast, average plasma cortisol levels in the ct group had returned to basal levels  by 3acs. these results confirm that  <dig> hours of exposure to 18°c was a severe stressor for these juvenile cod.

some of the terms more frequently represented amongst the go annotated ests derived from the forward libraries were protein folding, signal transduction, immune response, and response to stress . the genes associated with these terms may be important in the strategies involved with coping with stress, and variability in their sequences  and/or timing and magnitude of mrna expression  could reveal markers for increased resistance to thermal and other stressors . this is the first study to use high-throughput genomic techniques to investigate the response to heat-shock in cod, and to provide expression profiles of a wide range of transcripts encoding putative chaperone proteins in tissues of fish that have distinct physiological roles. many of the transcripts validated at the individual level using qpcr in this study had blastx hits that were associated with the go terms mentioned above and exhibited differences in expression profiles between tissues. these findings indicate that the cellular response to heat-shock in cod is complex, involves several genes, and may be controlled by different cues and/or transcription regulation mechanisms in different tissues, as has been observed in human cells  <cit> . in all three tissues studied we showed an increase in transcript levels of hsp70- <dig> . previous reports on cod and haddock   <cit>  did not detect an increase in hsc71/hsp70- <dig> protein expression in the gills and liver of cod or haddock in response to thermal stress. it could be that an elevation in hsc71/hsp70- <dig> protein was not detected in cod or haddock in the aforementioned studies due to the fact that the antibodies  used were not generated against cod or haddock hsp70- <dig> and may not have recognized the hsp70- <dig> protein in these species.

several of the cdnas identified in this study were represented by more than one contig in a single library. there are several possible reasons for the presence of more than one contig with the same annotation in a given library. multiple, same-named contigs may represent: a) different paralogues; b) different alleles at a given locus; or c) non-contiguous segments of a given cdna . for example, we report two contigs that were annotated as hsp90α in the head kidney forward library . further analysis of these contigs using nucleotide alignments against a full-length sequence obtained from chinook salmon   <cit>  suggests that these are likely to represent non-contiguous regions of the same cod cdna . however, the hsp family provides important examples of differential expression  between distinct paralogues   <cit> , and further studies addressing this question will be needed to determine the roles of different atlantic cod chaperone paralogues in thermal tolerance.

molecular chaperones play important roles in cell physiology in both unstressed and stressed situations. these proteins assist with the folding of nascent peptides and the de-novo folding of denatured proteins, the transport of unfolded proteins across membranes, quality control and conformational changes that affect function  <cit> . sudden or chronic increases in temperature are known to induce both mrna and protein expression of several chaperones, such as those belonging to the hsp family  <cit> .

among the clients that these proteins bind to are physiologically relevant proteins such as the glucocorticoid  <cit>  and aryl hydrocarbon  <cit>  receptors , heat-shock factor  <dig>  <cit>  , immunoglobulin  heavy chain  <cit>   and the toll-like receptors  <cit>  . transcripts encoding putative orthologues of all of these chaperones were identified in our libraries, and all of them were confirmed to be heat-shock responsive mrnas. hsp90α mrna expression was up-regulated in the liver more than 150-fold at cs relative to the before heat-shock  time point . the up-regulation of hsp90s in response to heat-shock has been demonstrated at both mrna and protein levels in different species of fish  <cit> . for example, cara et al.  <cit>  detected a ~6000% increase in hsp <dig> proteins and a ~600% increase in hsp <dig> protein in fasted +10°c heat-shocked rainbow trout larvae. in our study, there was a higher maximum fold-induction of hsp90α transcripts compared to hsp70- <dig> transcripts in both liver and muscle following heat-shock. we observed a significant increase in hsp70- <dig> mrna expression in the liver of ct fish at 12acs, which may have been a result of fasting. cara et al.  <cit>  observed increased hsp <dig> protein expression in fasted non heat-shocked rainbow trout larvae. among the many clients of these chaperones are heat-shock factor  <dig>  and the glucocorticoid receptor . therefore, the increase in the levels of mrnas encoding these chaperones may indicate that their products are essential in maintaining signal transduction during stress and are likely to be proteins involved in heat-stress tolerance.

stress also has an impact on the fish's immune system, and temperature stress has been shown to decrease serum igm content and increase the susceptibility of sea bass  to nodavirus  <cit> . nodaviruses belong to the family nodaviridae, and are the causative agents of viral nervous necrosis . these viral pathogens also infect cod, and can cause high levels of morbidity and mortality  <cit> . grp <dig> is essential for the appropriate folding and secretion of immunoglobulin light and heavy chains from the endoplasmic reticulum   <cit> . igm heavy chain transcripts in liver were significantly up-regulated by handling stress but not by heat-shock in our study , and thus, grp <dig> may be important for the proper folding of this immune relevant protein following exposure to only some types of stressor. grp <dig> mrna, which encodes the er-resident member of the hsp <dig> family, was significantly up-regulated by heat-shock in all tissues studied. grp <dig> , the er-resident member of the hsp <dig> family, is the major chaperone for the toll-like receptors   <cit> . yang et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that gp <dig> null mice were also macrophage-tlr null and highly susceptible to listeria infections. in our study, grp <dig> transcripts were significantly up-regulated in all tissues after heat-shock, with the head kidney presenting the highest up-regulation  at 3acs  relative to grp <dig> mrna levels before heat-shock. tlrs may play an important role in the defence against viral infections and have been shown to be up-regulated by the viral mimic pic in fugu   <cit> .

therefore, divergent forms of grp gene sequences or different expression profiles of the mrnas encoding these proteins between families and/or populations could play an important role in temperature-related immunosuppression. given that tlr <dig> mrna was significantly down-regulated in the head kidney of heat-shocked cod  when compared to its levels before heat-shock, and that this receptor in fish recognizes double-stranded rna and induces genes of the interferon pathway  <cit> , it is possible that its down-regulation following thermal stress results in reduced protein levels and is linked to decreased resistance to viruses in stressed fish  <cit>  . however, stress does not always correlate negatively with disease resistance. weber et al.  <cit>  have shown that a single  <dig> hour crowding event does not affect rainbow trout survival following a challenge with yersinia ruckeri . on the other hand, the work of fevolden et al.  <cit>  indicates that the impact of stress on immune competence may be pathogen-specific. these authors have shown that rainbow trout strains selected for high cortisol response had lower survival rate when challenged with a. salmonicida , but higher survival rates when challenged with vibrio anguillarum , when compared to strains selected for low cortisol response. fast et al.  <cit>  showed that atlantic salmon  subjected to long-term handling stress  had reduced up-regulation of lps -induced macrophage il-1β mrna expression compared to control fish. in this study, chronic handling stress appeared to cause reduced immune competence as evidenced by the decreased survival of isolated macrophages from stressed fish  following incubation with a. salmonicida  <cit> . clearly, the relationships between stress and immune responses in fish are complex and require further investigation.

other cod transcripts encoding molecular chaperone-like proteins were identified in this work including several putative members of the t-complex-containing chaperones , prolyl-peptidyl-isomerase , protein disulfide isomerase    <cit> , and an er-resident chaperone  that is essential for the normal synthesis of procollagen and its stabilization during stress  <cit> . collagen is an essential and ubiquitous component of the extracellular matrix and a potential target for denaturation and aggregation. we found that maximum up-regulation of hsp <dig> mrna by heat-shock was at 3acs in liver , and at 12acs in both skeletal muscle  and head kidney  when compared to its levels before heat-shock .

in mammals apoptosis induced by the denaturation and aggregation of proteins is one of the causes of death in heat-shocked cells  <cit> . over-expression of the hsp70- <dig> protein  plays an important role in protecting cells from apoptosis, presumably by preventing protein aggregation and inactivating the c-jun n-terminal kinase  pro-apoptotic pathway  <cit> . in our study, the mrna encoding the putative cod orthologue of this particular chaperone was one of the most highly induced transcripts in the liver, with a  <dig> -fold up-regulation at 12acs  relative to the bhs time point. although hsp70s have been shown to be anti-apoptotic in sea bream  primary macrophage cultures  <cit> , previous studies have reported that hsp70- <dig> protein is not responsive to heat-stress in cod  <cit> . however as previously mentioned, these studies relied on anti-mouse hsc71/hsp <dig> or anti-rainbow trout hsp <dig> protein commercial antibodies, which may not efficiently cross-react with the orthologous hsp <dig> protein in cod. we have demonstrated that, at least at the transcriptional level, there was a significant up-regulation of a hsp70-1-like transcript in response to heat-shock. moreover, the maximum-fold up-regulation of hsp70- <dig> mrna at 12acs in all tissues , is consistent with its reported role in acquired thermal tolerance during the recovery of mildly heat-shocked mammalian cells  <cit> . grp <dig> is also known to protect cells against apoptosis, since it interacts with the key players in the er stress signalling system  in non-stressed cells, preventing pro-apoptotic signalling  <cit> . misfolded proteins in the er interact with grp <dig>  which causes the activation of the pro-apoptotic er stress signalling cascades  <cit> . thus, up-regulation of the grp <dig> transcripts may lead to elevated levels of this protein that would still be able to silence the pro-apoptotic er stress signalling pathway. the up-regulation of nupr <dig>  mrna may also lead to increased expression of this protein, and be an indication of increased levels of anti-apoptotic factors in both liver and head kidney. this protein has been correlated with reduced apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells  <cit> . protein aggregation is known to trigger apoptosis  <cit> , and therefore, cell viability under thermal stress may depend on the ability to elicit a significant anti-apoptotic response through the expression of transcripts such as those encoding hsp70- <dig> and nupr <dig>  however, up-regulation of nupr <dig> has also been linked to the acute phase response to pancreatitis in mammals  <cit> . we found that bikunin transcript, which also encodes an acute phase protein, was down-regulated by handling stress in the liver and by heat-shock in the head kidney. thus, heat-shock may also affect the inflammatory response. in the spleen of atlantic cod, bikunin transcript levels were not affected by saline control injection , but were significantly suppressed by viral mimic  injection at  <dig> and  <dig> h post-injection, and significantly induced by the viral mimic at  <dig> h post-injection   <cit> . finally, it is worth noting that while nupr <dig> was identified as a contig of  <dig> sequences in the reverse liver library , qpcr showed that this transcript was up-regulated by heat-shock in the liver and head kidney of cod. this was not surprising however, as in our hands, the ssh technique sometimes appears to be less effective at enriching for genes that are down-regulated by a stressor  than at enriching for genes that are up-regulated by a stressor . as evidence of this, three out of four transcripts identified in a reverse spleen ssh library designed to be enriched for cod transcripts that were down-regulated by exposure to a stressor  could not be confirmed by qpcr as significantly down-regulated by the stressor   <cit> . therefore, the presence of nupr <dig> as a contig of  <dig> sequences in the reverse liver library in the current study could be an artifact of the ssh technique.

the timing of up-regulation of some transcripts encoding putative chaperone proteins suggests that hsp90α may be a first line of defence against heat-stress, while hsp70- <dig> may be more important during recovery. moreover, given that the mrna expression of most of the studied chaperone genes peaked either at cs or 3acs, we hypothesize that early time points may be crucial in the process of recovery and repair of damaged proteins. two other transcripts, cct  <dig> and cct  <dig>  putative members of the tcp <dig> complex, were significantly up-regulated by thermal stress in the liver at 3acs . of the  <dig> known mammalian members of this complex, we identified cdnas for  <dig> putative orthologues in cod: cct  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . these chaperonins are known to form heterologous polymers that assist in the folding of actins and tubulins  <cit> , important components of the cytoskeleton. structural proteins seem to be among the most heat-labile proteins, and their misfolding and/or denaturation contributes greatly to protein aggregation  <cit> .

although we only saw a small, albeit significant, down-regulation  of tctp mrna expression in the head kidney in the ct group relative to the bhs time point, this transcript may still represent an important component of the molecular mechanism involved in thermal resistance. the product of the tctp gene, a ubiquitously expressed protein in most mammalian cells, is known to bind to calcium and tubulin and to be responsive to stressors such as starvation and heat-stress  <cit> . in addition, bonnet et al.  <cit>  have shown that in yeast cells exposed to heat-shock there is a down-regulation of tctp mrna, and in rat  c <dig>  glioma cells tctp mrna is up-regulated in response to induced programmed cell-death  <cit> . down-regulation of tctp in response to heat-shock in yeast may be one of the mechanisms that prevent heat-induced apoptosis, and it is possible that this down-regulation, which was detected in our experiments , was not significant due to high variance between biological replicates . down-regulation of tctp may also play a role in preventing apoptosis triggered by other stressors  since we found it to be significantly down-regulated by  <dig>  fold at cs in the head kidney.

we saw little change in the mrna expression of genes with carbohydrate metabolism related functional annotations   with heat-shock at 18°c. however, this finding does not preclude the possibility that carbohydrate metabolism is increased when atlantic cod are acutely exposed to elevated temperatures. this is because glycolysis had a relatively high prevalence  amongst the biological process go terms in the muscle forward library . pfk and glycogen phosphorylase  are the rate limiting enzymes of glycolysis, and allosteric regulation of these enzymes is likely to be the main mechanism through which carbohydrate metabolism is re-organized during acute stress. finally, the results of perez-casanova et al.  <cit>  suggest that carbohydrate metabolism  is not up-regulated significantly in cod until temperature reaches at least 20°c during acute thermal stress.

interestingly, enolase transcript was significantly down-regulated  in the head kidney of control transferred  fish at the cs time point relative to the ct bhs time point, and grp <dig> mrna was significantly down-regulated in the liver in the ct group at all time points relative to the bhs time point. these results indicate that, even though there is a conserved general stress response, some responses at the transcriptome level are stressor specific .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the present work adds significantly to the available data on the stress physiology of cod. we have contributed a total of  <dig> ests  from three important stress-responsive tissues. among these are several cdnas encoding putative chaperones, which we have demonstrated to be responsive to heat-shock. apoptosis and the aggregation of denatured proteins are likely to play a major role in heat-induced cell death in fish cells. ssh-identified transcripts  that were not only highly responsive to heat-shock, but also dysregulated in all three tissues studied, encode proteins that are known to prevent both programmed cell-death and aggregation. the functional genomics research reported herein may lead to the development of molecular markers  that could be used for the selection of heat-resistant atlantic cod broodstock for the aquaculture industry.
