BACKGROUND
leishmania species are responsible for several pathologies affecting both humans and animals. these parasites are most abundant in developing countries in the middle east, asia and south america but also are endemic in the sub-mediterranean basin. they have emerged as one of the most important opportunistic agents in aids patients  <cit> . some cutaneous infections can be resolved and subsequently lead to the development of protection against new infection. these results indicate that immunologic approaches could be effective in preventing or curing infection  <cit> . however, an effective and safe vaccine has yet to be developed. efforts towards the development of new cures or vaccines have recently been facilitated by the sequencing of l. major  <cit> , l. braziliensis and l. infantum genomes.

l. infantum is a member of the l. donovani complex, which is primarily responsible for life-threatening visceral leishmaniasis. these parasites differ significantly from l. major and l. mexicana, species causing cutaneous leishmaniasis that are classified as old-world and new-world, respectively, based on their geographical distribution. l. infantum is present in both europe and the americas, where it has been named l. chagasi  <cit> . whilst there has been some debate about whether l. infantum originated in the old world or the new world, it has been proposed that l. infantum and l. chagasi are essentially genetically indistinguishable  <cit> . l. infantum can infect humans and dogs, causing zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis in children and immunosuppressed adults as well as canine visceral leishmaniasis   <cit> . canl is a severe disease that can be fatal if left untreated. current treatment is complicated and expensive and generally does not result in complete cure. a vaccine would be an important tool in the prevention of canl and, as dogs are the prime reservoir species for l. infantum, could also reduce the incidence of human visceral leishmaniasis  <cit> .

the sequencing projects for leishmania  <cit>  and other trypanosomatids  <cit>  have led to the identification of many leishmania-specific genes that potentially might be exploited for vaccine and drug design  <cit> . moreover, additional candidates are likely to be identified as the currently unidentified gene products are ascribed a function  <cit> . however, validation or rejection of a protein as a potential vaccine or chemotherapeutic target requires significant experimental investigations that are time-consuming. thus decisions upon priorities for study are crucial. investigating the extent to which key proteins are conserved between leishmania species is one primary consideration, as currently it is unclear to what extent knowledge acquired from one leishmania species can be applied to other species. this has important practical applications, as the leishmanias are not all geographically distinct and some virulence factors, when used as a vaccine, have been shown to exhibit distinct protective ability between members of l. donovani complex and l. major  <cit> . the recent completion of the sequencing of the l. infantum and l. braziliensis genomes and comparison of these with that of l. major has facilitated analyses of gene/protein conservation but also it has revealed leishmania species-specific genes and proteins that could be key mediators of species-specific disease phenotypes.

cysteine peptidases  have been characterised as virulence factors and vaccine candidates in leishmania  <cit> . l. mexicana possesses three families of related cps encoded by single  or multicopy  genes  <cit> . while gene deletions of lmxcpb, and to a lesser extent lmxcpc, lead to an attenuated phenotype, null mutants for lmxcpa exhibited no apparent change in phenotype  <cit> . however, the double null mutant for lmxcpb and lmxcpa did not induce any lesions in balb/c mice and the ability of this line to induce an immune response in mice suggested that it has potential as an attenuated live vaccine  <cit> .

in order to assess the level of conservation in both structure and function of these cps between leishmania species, we have initiated a characterisation of cysteine peptidase orthologues in a cloned l. infantum line  derived from a recent isolate from a naturally infected dog in spain. to validate the usefulness of jpcm <dig> for this and other experimental studies, we have tested whether the clone has the essential characteristics for a laboratory model: that it causes visceral leishmaniasis in experimental animals and is accessible to most experimental studies including reproduction of its life cycle in vitro and genetic manipulation. we present here the results of this analysis and the use of the clone for a molecular study on licpa.

RESULTS
isolation and characterisation of l. infantum jpcm5
leishmania parasites were recovered from a naturally infected dog from the madrid area, spain. they were characterised as l. infantum zymodeme  <dig>  by isoenzyme analysis  <cit>  and transformed into promastigotes in vitro before being stored under liquid nitrogen as jpc . five independent clones  were derived from this stock by colony cloning and tested for infectivity in hamsters. two of the cell lines were recovered from the spleen  <dig> weeks after infection confirming that they had conserved their infection potential. clone m <dig>  was selected for all further studies.

jpcm <dig> grew well as promastigotes in vitro in many of the media used to grow leishmania, including rpmi, sdm <dig> and nnn. a temporary increase of serum concentration from  <dig> to 20%  promoted the parasite's growth following adaptation to a different medium, cloning, transformation from, or to, amastigotes and transfection experiments. in homem medium with 10%  serum, the parasites had a doubling time of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  h. after  <dig> to  <dig> days in culture, when stationary phase had been reached, most promastigotes had a metacyclic morphology, indicating that metacyclogenesis had occurred. stationary phase promastigotes of jpcm <dig>  grown in homem medium, were transformed in vitro into amastigote-like forms using conditions previously described for other l. infantum lines  <cit> . the transformation of the entire culture, according to morphological parameters, required  <dig> to  <dig> days at 37°c in acidic medium . this was accompanied by changes in protein profile as determined by sds-page . the axenic amastigotes could be maintained, with the help of regular sub-passages, or transformed back into promastigotes by switching the culture conditions to 28°c in homem medium with 10%  fcs. it generally required four days for transformation fully back to promastigotes.

l. infantum jpcm <dig> were infective to human and dog macrophages  and hamsters. jpcm <dig> parasites could be recovered from spleen, liver and bone marrow of infected hamsters less than two months post infection. long-term in vitro culture of some leishmania species has been reported to result in loss of virulence  <cit> . to test whether this applied to jpcm <dig>  promastigotes were sub-passaged in vitro for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> weeks  before being inoculated into hamsters. in each case, amastigotes were recovered from the spleen after less than three months indicating that the promastigotes had not lost their virulence and were still able to establish an infection. these in vitro and in vivo results indicated that jpcm <dig> is suitable for most cell-culture studies.

isolation of the cpa cysteine peptidase gene
the complete cpa gene of l. infantum jpcm <dig> , including the orf and the 5' and 3' flanks, was amplified by pcr using primers derived from the l. mexicana cpa  <cit>  and sequenced. the licpa orf sequence predicted a protein of  <dig> amino acids corresponding to a size of  <dig>  kda, an isoelectric point of  <dig>  and possessing a  <dig> amino acid c-terminal extension similar to the l. mexicana cpa  <cit> . comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with the translated cpa sequences from several leishmania species is shown in figure  <dig>  licpa shares  <dig> % amino acid identity with the published l. chagasi cpa   <cit> ,  <dig> % with l. major cpa  and  <dig> % with l. mexicana cpa  protein sequences, respectively. there are three potential n-glycosylation sites in licpa, two in the mature domain  and one at the beginning of the c-terminal extension ; the last two being conserved in all sequences except in l. mexicana and l. braziliensis. however, amino-acid residues important for catalysis, 153c, 289h and 309n, as well as the predicted glutamine of the oxyanion hole 147q, are conserved in all sequences  <cit> . licpa is identical in size to cpa from l. major, l. mexicana and l. donovani, but differs from lbcpa, which has a  <dig> amino acid c-terminal extension. a c-terminal extension is characteristic of the cathepsin l-like cpb cysteine peptidases of leishmania and other trypanosomatids  <cit> , but has not been observed before in any cpa protein.

southern blot analysis showed that licpa is single-copy  and northern blotting showed that licpa is expressed at similar levels in log phase and stationary phase promastigotes and also amastigotes . a licpa deletion construct containing the sat gene flanked by about  <dig> bp of licpa 5' and 3' flank regions was generated and used to transfect jpcm <dig> parasites. the parasites were selected in 96-well plates with homem medium supplemented with the antibiotic nourseothricin. in these conditions, one clone was obtained seven weeks post-transfection. southern blot analysis  and pcr analyses  showed correct integration of the sat construct into the licpa locus. moreover, the wild type alleles could not be amplified with cpa gene specific primers , and cpa mrna could not be detected , confirming that this nourseothricin-resistant clone  is a null mutant resulting from loss of heterozygocity.

a second transfection was performed on jpcm <dig> promastigotes with a second deletion construct derived from the previous one by replacement of the sat marker by the ble gene. the transfection and selection steps were performed as previously, except that  <dig> μg/ml of phleomycin was used in place of nourseothricin. four clones grew onto agar plates after two weeks. pcr  and southern blot  analysis demonstrated that these four clones were Δlicpa heterozygote mutants having correctly integrated the ble construct into one licpa allele. one of these  was selected and re-transfected with a third cpa knockout construct, pgl <dig>  carrying the hyg gene. a total of  <dig> clones were obtained from four 96-well plates after two weeks of selection in the presence of both phleomycin and hygromycin. southern analysis of one of these clones, called Δlicpac <dig>  confirmed that it was indeed a hygromycin- and bleomycin-resistant Δlicpa null mutant  and rt-pcr analysis of cdna showed the absence of cpa mrna . the licpa gene was re-introduced into the cpa locus in both Δlicpa mutants. the re-integration construct, pgl <dig>  contained the licpa orf surrounded by the native 5' flank with 3' sequence derived from the dhfr locus, and the blasticidin-resistance gene enclosed between the 5' and 3' dhfr flank sequences. both Δlicpa mutants were transfected with the re-integration cassette and selection achieved in the presence of  <dig> μg/ml of blasticidin. several clones were isolated from each transfection  and the correct replacement of previously integrated deletion cassettes was confirmed by pcr  and southern blot . licpa re-expression in Δlicpac <dig> and Δlicpac <dig> was demonstrated by rt-pcr .

the Δlicpac <dig> and Δlicpac <dig> mutants were grown as promastigotes in homem medium. in these conditions, they exhibited no apparent growth reduction compared with wild type jpcm <dig>  they were also both able to transform into axenic amastigotes. in order to assess whether the mutants lacking cpa were virulent, their infectivity toward human macrophages was investigated. in comparison with jpcm <dig>  the Δlicpac <dig> and Δlicpac <dig> mutants had a reduced ability to infect human macrophages  and a reduced number of amastigotes/infected macrophage . the infectivity was restored to wild type levels by re-expression of cpa in the Δlicpac <dig> mutant, but Δlicpac1::cpa had a virulence phenotype midway between the Δlicpac <dig> mutant and wild type parasites. some cell lines were also tested for their ability to infect macrophages of dogs . no statistically significant differences  were observed between wild type, Δlicpac <dig> orΔlicpac1::cpa with respect to percentage of infected macrophages or the number of amastigotes per infected macrophage.

the virulence of Δlicpac <dig> to hamsters was found to be significantly less than for the wild type jpcm <dig>  in a hamster infection model  parasites were not detected in the liver and only very low levels were detected in the spleen, with the number of parasites decreasing between  <dig> and  <dig> months post-infection. the overall parasite burden for these clones was between 102- and 104-fold lower compared with jpcm <dig> at  <dig> and  <dig> months post-infection, respectively. the virulence of Δlicpac1::cpa was also compared in vivo to jpcm <dig>  low numbers of parasites were found in the spleen of Δlicpac1::cpa infected hamsters  <dig> months post-infection, whereas no parasites were detected in spleen or liver of hamsters at other time points, indicating the virulence was not restored in the re-expresser clones.

discussion
l. major was the first leishmania species to have its genome sequenced  <cit> . for comparative genomics, it was thought that the second leishmania species to have its genome sequenced should be a causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis. there are several closely-related species of the l. donovani species complex that are found in different geographical regions. l. donovani is the primary cause of visceral leishmaniasis in the indian subcontinent and east africa, l. infantum in the mediterranean region and l. chagasi in the new world. humans are the only known reservoir of l. donovani in india, while canines, especially domestic and stray dogs, provide the main reservoir host for l. infantum and l. chagasi  <cit> . while the last two species are considered to be genetically identical  <cit> , all three are very similar. based on gene sequencing and microsatellite analysis , recent studies have been unable to separate east african l. donovani strains from l. infantum  <cit> . these african strains are also very close to the indian l. donovani strains. thus, it could be argued that whichever l. donovani complex species was chosen for the genome project, the nucleotide sequence data generated from the protein coding regions would be likely to be almost identical. however, in order to maximise the value arising from the genome sequencing, the parasite needs to be an experimentally amenable organism.

the data resulting from the analyses described in this paper show that l. infantum jpcm <dig> has the following characteristics that make it a suitable line for many experimental studies. it has been characterized as belonging to zymodeme mon- <dig> by isoenzyme typing. mon- <dig> is one of the most prevalent zymodemes in europe and the mediterranean basin, in countries such as greece, france, spain, italy, algeria and syria, and is also found in brazil  <cit> . jpcm <dig> has been shown to be virulent to hamsters  and dogs  <cit> , causing the symptoms of visceral leishmaniasis in both animals. these observations are important as they show that the parasite has maintained its virulence following isolation, cloning and prolonged culture in the laboratory. the three major life-cycle stages of jpcm <dig> can be grown in vitro. importantly, amastigotes can be propagated in vitro, and grown in canine macrophages or human macrophages. we have also shown that jpcm <dig> can be transfected successfully with both integration  and episomal  vectors. transfected mutants can be cloned on soft agar plates or by limiting dilution. the strain is therefore suitable for genetic manipulation studies on genes identified from the genome project. jpcm <dig> maintains virulence to animals after transfection and cell culture . this is important as it allows virulence studies to be carried out on mutant parasites defective for virulence genes. many isolates of l. donovani lose their virulence after transfection and prolonged culture, making it difficult to use this species for molecular genetic studies on virulence  <cit> , thus the suitability of jpcm <dig> for such studies is an important attribute. l. infantum jpc is infective for sandfly vectors of the species lutzomyia longipalpis  <cit> , one of the most widely available laboratory colonized sandfly  <cit> . finally, the l. infantum jpc isolate can be successfully used as a challenge strain for vaccine studies  <cit> .

this study has confirmed through analysis of the cp cpa that l. infantum jpcm <dig> is experimentally useful. moreover, the investigation has provided important insight into how the roles of proteins may differ between leishmania species. our laboratory previously demonstrated that cysteine peptidases are potent virulence factors in l. mexicana  <cit> . whilst l. mexicana Δcpa mutants did not show a defect in virulence in vivo  <cit> , the Δcpa/cpb double mutants had a more defined virulence phenotype than Δcpb – indicating that cpa plays an important role in this parasite  <cit> . virulence determinants are not always conserved between species; for example the l. donovani major antigen a <dig> was shown to not be expressed in l. major  <cit> . hence, we undertook the study of licpa to determine how similar its role is in l. infantum and l. mexicana.

we deleted cpa in l. infantum and tested the mutants for virulence in vitro and in vivo. two independent Δlicpa mutants were characterised in this study. the first mutant generated, Δlicpac <dig>  was the result of a loss of heterozygocity, an event that has been reported to occur naturally in response to an increase of drug concentration and involves duplication of the allele carrying the antibiotic resistance gene which leads to higher expression of the gene product essential for parasite survival  <cit> . the second mutant, Δlicpac <dig>  was generated classically using two independent markers and methods identical to the ones used for l. mexicana  <cit> . for both mutants, molecular analysis confirmed that the expected gene replacements had taken place, so the Δlicpa mutants could be considered genetically indistinguishable at the level of the deleted licpa locus. indeed both mutants exhibited an attenuated phenotype, in vitro, in human macrophages, and, in vivo, in hamster infections. this indicates that licpa might play a more important role in l. infantum virulence than was found in the l. mexicana studies. these findings were apparently not corroborated by dog macrophage experiments where Δlicpac <dig> was found as infective as wild type parasites. however, the overall level of infection achieved – almost  <dig> times fewer dog macrophages were infected than human macrophages with jpcm <dig> wild-type parasites – may have been too low to truly analyse the phenotype of Δlicpac <dig>  on the other hand, the number of amastigotes per infected macrophage was not significantly different between wild type and mutant parasites, which suggests that licpa is not required for l. infantum survival in dog macrophages. one possible explanation for the different behaviour of the parasites in human and canine macrophage cell lines is the different status of the host cells: the u <dig> human monocytes were activated by pma, whereas the dh <dig> canine monocytes were not activated prior to addition of the parasites. the low percentage of infection of the dh <dig> cells maybe due to the non-activated status of the monocytes and consequently differences in virulence between the parasite lines would be harder to detect in such a system.

the finding that re-expression of only one licpa gene was sufficient in itself to complement the reduced infectivity of both licpa-deficient mutants for human macrophages confirm the importance of licpa for l. infantum virulence to these cells. Δlicpac1::cpa was only half as virulent as Δlicpac2::cpa, this may reflect a lower level of licpa re-expression in the first cell line. alternatively, we could not exclude that the loss of heterozygocity had not been accompanied by other re-arrangements destined to help the parasites to adapt to the higher drug concentration and consequently that Δlicpac <dig> and Δlicpac1::cpa were less fit than Δlicpac <dig> and Δlicpac2::cpa to infect macrophages; investigating this will require more sensitive methods as the level of macrophages infected observed with the deficient mutants were very low. in contrast, in vivo experiments did not show any recovery in virulence of Δlicpac1::cpa compared with Δlicpac <dig>  this is not very different from the results in human macrophages since here the virulence of the Δcpac <dig> mutants was also found to be strongly reduced while the virulence was only partly restored in Δcpac1::cpa . one explanation is that the Δlicpac1::cpa clone expresses only one licpa allele whereas wild type parasites have two. also there is dissimilarity between the licpa genetic context in these two cell lines; the 5' licpa flank sequence of both clones was identical, however the nature of the 3' flank was different in that the re-expressers possessed the l. major 3' dhfr flank sequence downstream of the licpa gene. therefore the level of expression of cpa may not precisely mimic the in vivo situation during the infection process and during differentiation of promastigote to amastigote. the dhfr sequence is classically used in leishmania constructs to stabilize the mrna, leading to higher levels of expression  <cit> . the exact nature of these key signals is still cryptic and the re-expresser lines may provide a tool to investigate them.

the results of this study differ in several key respects to those of mundodi et al., who described the characterisation of the lccys <dig> gene in l. chagasi  <cit> . lccys <dig>  <cit>  is the functional and syntenic homologue of l. infantum cpa and differs in sequence at only  <dig> amino acid positions. lccys <dig> expression is amastigote-specific, yet surprisingly mundodi et al. were unable to obtain homozygous null mutants of lccys <dig> in the promastigote life-cycle stage  <cit> . in contrast, in this study we showed that licpa is expressed in all life-cycle stages analysed and we were able to generate several independent licpa null mutants, which were viable as promastigotes in vitro. the efficiency of transformation can vary between strains of leishmania and between species, which might account for the differences observed in the ability to isolate genetically modified parasites. indeed, our studies indicate that l. chagasi and l. infantum may not be genetically indistinguishable, as has been proposed  <cit> , but the two species might have species-specific differences with functional consequences. it is possible that there have been genome re-arrangements to compensate for the loss of cpa, but these would be hard to detect. there is likely to be some plasticity in the genome of different strains of l. infantum, but jpcm <dig> is a good starting point on which to base further studies on genetic variation between isolates of the same species. however, both this study and that of mundodi et al. identified the importance of the licpa/lccys <dig> gene in leishmania infantum/chagasi infection and pathogenesis.

CONCLUSIONS
we provide evidence that the cpa cysteine peptidase is not essential for replication of l. infantum promastigotes, but is important for the host-parasite interaction. determining the precise roles that licpa plays in the intracellular amastigote stage of the parasite will require further investigation.
