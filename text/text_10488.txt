BACKGROUND
genome size is one of the most fundamental genetic properties of living organisms. moreover, the size of an organism's genome has important practical implications for applications ranging from pcr-based microsatellite genotyping to whole-genome sequencing  <cit> .

the genome sizes of invertebrates  remain understudied relative to their abundance and diversity. this is particularly true in light of their impacts on human health, industry, agriculture and science. of the nearly  <dig> , <dig> described species of insects, genome sizes have been estimated for approximately  <dig> . for comparison, genome size estimates exist for  <dig> % of mammals  and  <dig> % of birds   <cit> .

ants  are among the most familiar, abundant and ecologically important of the arthropods  <cit> , yet few genomic tools exist for this family of insects, and virtually nothing is known of their genome sizes. of the nearly  <dig>  species of ants that likely exist, the genome size of only one  has been reported  <cit> , and the two estimates for this species differ by > <dig> mb.

numerous studies have documented naturally occurring variation in genome size at various taxonomic levels. clearly, extremely distantly related organisms usually possess genomes of different sizes, as the accumulated effects of genomic expansions and contractions have had ample time to produce measurable differences in genome size. a number of studies have documented genome size variation over more recent evolutionary time-spans – among congeneric species  <cit> , and even among individuals within single species .

ultimately, this genome size variation is determined by the net effects of genome expansion and genomic deletion . processes that act at the chromosomal scale, such as polyploidy, aneuploidy, and whole genome duplication, can produce rapid and extreme changes in genome size. at smaller scales, the expansion of genomes can be driven by mechanisms such as the proliferation of transposable elements  <cit>  or various types of non-coding dna . for example, both the length  <cit>  and frequency  <cit>  of microsatellites  are positively correlated with genome size. this is true for taxa as disparate as arabidopsis thaliana, caenorhabditis elegans, saccharomyces cerevisiae, drosophila melanogaster, and homo sapiens . the duplication of coding sequences also appears to play a role in the evolution of genome size, and may be more important for generating phenotypic variation than is widely appreciated  <cit> . the mechanisms involved in genomic shrinkage, however, remain unclear, and various hypotheses have been proposed to explain this process , including reduction of long tandem repeats , illegitimate and unequal recombination, and the accumulation of small deletions  <cit> . overall, the rate of genome size evolution appears to be proportional to genome size, as larger genomes are more likely to experience large or rapid expansions and contractions  <cit> .

the phenotypic correlates and consequences of genome size variation remain murky, but correlative studies in a variety of taxonomic groups have identified a handful of characteristics that co-vary with genome size . for example, a positive relationship between body size and genome size has been reported for several taxonomic groups, including turbellarian flatworms  <cit> , copepods  <cit> , aphids  <cit>  and mosquitoes  <cit> . moreover, animals with high metabolic rates, such as flying birds and bats, tend to have smaller genomes, suggesting that metabolism may be a constraint  <cit> . although the ancestors of extant birds possessed genomes that were small., modern flightless birds, which have presumably been released from flight-associated metabolic constraints, possess genomes that are larger than flying birds  <cit> . similarly, flying insects have extremely high mass-corrected metabolic rates  <cit> , and generally have small genomes . at a broad taxonomic level, genome size also appears to be related to developmental life history. gregory  <cit>  proposed, based on data from  <dig> insect orders, that holometabolous groups  have smaller genomes than those that are hemimetabolous or ametabolous. specifically, the holometabolous orders possess genomes smaller than 1c =  <dig> pg whereas the ametabolous and hemimetabolous taxa, with exceptions  <cit> , possess genomes that span a range from < <dig> pg to < <dig> pg. interestingly, a similar pattern occurs in amphibians – species with rapid metamorphosis typically possess smaller genomes than those characterized by direct development, slower metamorphosis, or neoteny  . the adaptive significance of these correlations, if any, remains unclear. finally, cell size appears to be positively correlated with genome size in a variety of taxonomic groups  <cit> .

in this study, we use flow cytometry to estimate the genome sizes for  <dig> species of ants, collected from  <dig> of the  <dig> recognized subfamilies. these data were collected from  <dig> separate genome size estimations, from  <dig> individual ants. we also test the hypothesis that genome size is positively correlated with body size, as has been reported in other taxa. using data from the recent studies of ant phylogeny, we place these results in a phylogenetic context.

RESULTS
our data increase the number of published genome size estimates for ants from  <dig> species  to  <dig> species. only three other insect families  have had genomes sizes estimated for more species  <cit>  . similarly, only four other orders of insects  have genome sizes estimated for more species  <cit>  .

overall, the mean genome size of the ant species examined here was  <dig>  mb , and values for individual species ranged three-fold, from  <dig>  mb  in cerapachys edentata to  <dig>  mb  in ectatomma tuberculatum . the subfamilies within which these two species occur  also had the most extreme genome sizes of the ant subfamilies, but we only estimated genome sizes for a single species within each of these subfamilies. for subfamilies represented by more than one exemplar, the dolichoderinae had the smallest mean genome size  and the ponerinae possessed the largest . the small size of ant genomes appears to be similar to non-ant hymenoptera. for example, the wasp, polistes dominulus, possesses a genome size of  <dig>  mb   <cit> , and the genome size of the honeybee, apis mellifera, is  <dig> mb   <cit> .

 <dig> when replicates were taken from the same individual, the total number of individuals used is shown in parentheses

 <dig> excludes tapinoma sessile individual with  <dig>  mb genome.

ants, in general, appear to possess small genomes relative to other insect families . of the  <dig> families for which sufficient data exist, only  <dig> possess a mean genome size that is smaller than that of the formicidae. moreover,  <dig> of these  <dig> families are represented by a single species, and  <dig> have estimates from only two species.

our estimate of genome size for the fire ant, solenopsis xyloni, was  <dig>  mb . this appears to be substantially smaller than the genome size of the congeneric red imported fire ant, s. invicta, estimated at  <dig>  mb using flow cytometry  <cit> .

for one species, myrmecina americana, we found individual workers with two distinctly different genome sizes living within the same colony. nine of the individuals sampled possessed a genome size that was near  <dig> mb, but two individuals possessed genomes of about  <dig>  mb. this could represent true intraspecific variation in genome size, or may indicate the presence of an undescribed cryptic social parasite, which has been reported for this species . in our analyses, we treat these classes of individuals as two different samples.

similarly, the two odontomachus chelifer individuals analyzed possessed genomes that differed by  <dig>  mb. this difference is unlikely to be measurement error, as we repeated our measurements for both of these individuals and found similar values. for this species, we included both values in our analyses, since we had no a priori reason to expect the presence of two different species.

the largest proportion of the total variance  was observed among subfamilies, followed by 36% of the total variance apportioned among genera . only  <dig> % of the total variance was apportioned among species, but this is likely a consequence of the relatively small number of species sampled within some of the subfamilies and genera.

the tfsi test on the genome size values of the terminal taxa yielded p-values of  <dig> , whether or not outliers were excluded. we then used independent contrast values to test the relationship between body size and genome size. independent contrast analysis of genome size vs. body size showed no significant correlation between genome size and head width when phylogeny was taken into account . re-running the tfsi test using the contrast data indicated that the use of independent contrasts had successfully reduced any influence of phylogenetic autocorrelation on the data . compared to previously studied taxa  <cit> , the ants studied here possessed a substantially narrower range of genome sizes, which may have made it more difficult to detect a relationship between genome size and body size.

comparison of genome sizes among subfamilies suggests that genomes of ants have both expanded and contracted since the origin of ants, approximately  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . amblyopone pallipes, in the less derived subfamily amblyoponinae, possesses a genome size of  <dig>  mb , which is slightly larger than the mean size of the more derived formicidae, dolichoderinae and myrmicinae . the ponerinae, on the other hand, possess genomes that are larger than that of a. pallipes, suggesting a genomic expansion in this lineage.

interestingly, we found evidence for genomic expansion, perhaps via whole-genome duplication, in two ant lineages. ectatomma tuberculatum, the sole species sampled from the subfamily ectatomminae, possesses a genome size of  <dig>  mb , which is about twice that of the most closely related subfamilies, formicinae , myrmicinae  and dolichoderinae  . this suggests that a genome duplication may have occurred in an ancestor of ectatomma, potentially as long as 80– <dig> million years ago  <cit> . more thorough sampling of species in this and closely related subfamilies  may illuminate more precisely when this large genomic expansion occurred.

similarly, the genome size of the fungus-growing ant, apterostigma dentigerum , is about twice that of the most closely related species. atta cephalotes , a. columbica  and sericomyrmex amabilis , also fungus-growing ants in the tribe attini, possess genomes that are about 47%, 47% and 69%, respectively, the size of the apterostigma genome. because the fungus-growing attines diverged from other ants about  <dig> million years ago  <cit>  the genomic expansion in apterostigma may have occurred more recently than the one in ectatomma. the history of this genomic expansion, and whether it arose via a whole-genome duplication, could be clarified by a closer examination of these genomes for signatures of genome duplication as well as knowledge of genome size in more closely related species, such as in the genera mycocepurus and cyphomyrmex  <cit> .

although few other studies have examined genome size at the levels of individual, species, genus, and subfamily, recent analyses of spiders and species of lepidoptera have revealed patterns similar to what we report for the ants. specifically, within lepidoptera, genome size varies little within subfamilies, and more substantially among subfamilies and families  <cit> . similarly, in spiders most of the variation in genome size occurs within families, and less is partitioned among genera and species  <cit> .

previous studies have suggested that animals with high metabolic rates, including flying insects, possess relatively small genomes  <cit> . although most individual ants are wingless workers, and do not ever fly, ants still have extremely small genomes. this may be because males and queens, in many species, engage in nuptial flights. this pattern may hold for non-flying lineages because they are descended from ancestors who flew  <cit> , and thus had high metabolic rates.

a growing body of research suggests that species that undergo complete metamorphosis possess genomes that are smaller than  <dig> pg  <cit> . our data match this pattern: all ants undergo complete metamorphosis and the genome sizes of the species that we examined all fall at the small end of the spectrum. in fact, compared to other insect families, ants  appear to possess some of the smallest genomes .

clearly, within this family, as well as within other taxonomic groups, there are interesting and unexplained patterns of genome size variation. within the ants, exploration of intergeneric genome size variation within the attini or inter-subfamilial variation centered on ectatomminae may illuminate processes involved in the expansion and contraction of genomes across divergent evolutionary time scales. these data may be particularly useful when placed into phylogenetic context using the recent in-depth studies of moreau et al.  <cit>  and brady et al.  <cit> . similarly, closer examination of genetic characteristics such as number of transposable elements, intron size, and microsatellite size and number, may elucidate the mechanisms by which genomes expand and contract through time.

finally, the recent development of genomic tools for ants  <cit>  and whole-genome sequences for other hymenoptera  <cit>  suggest that similar resources may be on the horizon for other ant species. because genome size is an important consideration for whole-genome sequencing programs, our genome size data will be useful for guiding selection of candidate ant taxa. not only will knowledge of genome size be useful in this arena, for the development of ant genomics, but the resulting genomic tools will also inform studies of genome size evolution.

CONCLUSIONS
the total amount of genetic material possessed by an organism is a fundamental feature of its biology. however, we currently know little about the processes that underlie variation in genome size, or even how much variation occurs within and among most taxa. our study is the first to explore the variation and evolution of genome size in ants, and one of the first  to examine genome size variation across a range of taxonomic levels, from individuals up to subfamilies. we show that ants, in general, have remarkably small genomes, and that most variation in genome size occurs among subfamilies. given the ecological, agricultural and economic importance of ants, these findings indicate that many species may be amenable to the development of genomic tools, or even whole-genome sequencing projects. moreover, the presence of both large- and small-scale variation in genome size  suggests that ants may be useful model systems for exploring the general processes underlying the evolution of genomes.
