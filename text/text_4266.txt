BACKGROUND
acute lymphoblastic leukemia  is a rapidly-developing aggressive cancer of white blood cells that starts in the bone marrow  <cit> , and is the most prevalent pediatric cancer  <cit> . glucocorticoids  cause massive cell death and cell cycle arrest in malignant cells from the lymphoid lineage and are therefore included in almost all treatment protocols for lymphoid malignancies, particularly childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia   <cit> . gcs exert their effects through their cognate receptor, the gc-receptor . the gr is a ligand-activated zinc finger transcription factor of the nuclear receptor family  <cit>  that resides in the cytoplasm and, upon ligand binding, translocates into the nucleus, where it modulates expression of its target gene either by binding to gc-responsive elements in the gene promoters/enhancers or by protein-protein interactions with other transcription factors  <cit> .

treatment of chall includes administration of synthetic gcs, mostly prednisolone , but also dexamethasone , during various phases of therapy in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs, resulting in a cure rate of up to ~90%  <cit> . the most commonly used gc in chall is pred, the active metabolite of prednisone  <cit> . in the past several years, dex has been increasingly used for chall treatment, specifically in a delayed intensification phase of current treatment protocols  <cit>  that result in lower bone marrow and cns relapse rates, but also increased adverse effects. dex differs molecularly from pred only by a fluorine atom at the 9α position of ring b and a methyl group at position c <dig> of ring d. dex has enhanced lymphoblast cytotoxicity and cns penetration capability, the latter being crucial to successful all therapy since, despite the good outcome of contemporary childhood all treatments, cns relapses remain a challenge  <cit> . treatment of the cns is considered a quantum leap forward in improving the overall survival of chall patients  <cit> . pharmacokinetic investigations showed that the shorter half-life of pred  affects its protein-binding properties and might reduce the duration of leukemic cell exposure to cytotoxic concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid, compromising its effectiveness  <cit> . moreover, the dex-gr complex is thought to be more stable than the pred-gr complex, and the gr seems to have a greater affinity for dex than pred in leukemic cells  <cit> . generally, dex seems to be the more active corticosteroid in the treatment of all  <cit> , and many studies reported increased event-free survival and significantly decreased risk of cns relapses with dex vs. pred .

however, these improvements are also associated with increased toxicity of dex. specifically, a symptomatic osteonecrosis that disproportionately affects adolescent chall patients has been correlated with continuous dex treatment in the delayed intensification phase  <cit> . lowering the effective dex concentration by alternative week rather than continuous treatment in a 21 day-long delayed intensification phase has been shown to significantly reduce osteonecrosis among high risk chall patients   <cit> .

analysis of dex and pred data from the literature is complicated due to heterogeneity of treatment regimens, dose ratios and study populations. teuffel et al.  <cit>  recently published a meta-analysis comparing the efficacy and toxicity of both synthetic gcs in the induction phase of chall therapy in an effort to account for the above mentioned complications. while dex has been shown to be more effective than pred in lowering cns and bone marrow relapses, it was also significantly associated with death during induction, neuro-psychiatric adverse events and myopathy.

although many clinical studies comparing the effects of pred and dex have been conducted, to our knowledge, the differences between the two gcs have not been investigated on a molecular level. this study, therefore, focused on determining whether these differences might be explained by differences in the transcriptional responses of chall cells to treatment with the  <dig> synthetic gcs at comparable biological activities.

RESULTS
bioactivity of dexamethasone and prednisolone
comparison of the transcriptional responses to the two synthetic gcs requires treatment of the cells in bio-equivalent concentrations of the two agents. the commonly used concentration of dex in in vitro studies is  <dig> e-7 m  <cit> . to determine an equivalent pred concentration, we treated t-chall ccrf-cem-c7h <dig> cells in three independent experiments with  <dig> e-7 m dex and  <dig> e-7 m,  <dig> e-7 m and  <dig> e-7 m pred concentrations. ethanol-treated cells served as empty carrier controls. gc-bioactivity levels were recorded in all experiments after  <dig> and 24 hours of treatment in the cell supernatants using our recently established gc-bioactivity assay   <cit> . the gba measures gc activity using a reporter construct containing gr binding sites, thus directly determining the transcriptional activity of the ligand-activated gr. in addition, cells were harvested after  <dig>   <dig> and 72 hours, treated with propidium iodide  and subjected to facs analysis to determine the percentage of cells undergoing cell death. gc-bioactivity levels remained constant over time for all gcs/concentrations, suggesting a long half-life of pred and dex . from all pred concentrations used,  <dig> e-7 m yielded the closest gc-bioactivity to  <dig> e-7 m  and was thus selected as the dex-equivalent pred concentration. cell death induction was observed for all gc concentrations, with rates surpassing 80% after 72 hours in all instances. interestingly, however, cell death rates of all pred concentrations were slightly lower after 48 hours than those of  <dig> e-7 m dex.figure  <dig>

to determine whether the gc activity of these concentrations is achievable in children given the standard scheduling and dosing of the drugs we measured the gc bioactivity in serum samples of  <dig> childhood b-all patients taken prior to and  <dig> and 24 hours after initiation of the systemic gc mono-therapy. the administered prednisolone resulted in gc bioactivities equivalent to that of  <dig> e-7 m dex , showing that the in vitro used concentrations are indeed pharmacologically relevant.taken together,  <dig> e-7 m pred resulted in about the same gc bioactivity as  <dig> e-7 m dex and had a similar potency to induce cell death in all cells .

comparison of the transcriptional responses to dex and pred
we next investigated whether the response of all cells exposed to either synthetic gc differed at the transcriptional level by generating a microarray data set with rna extracted from cells of the above experiments, i.e., from ccrf-cem-c7h <dig> cells treated for 6 hours with  <dig> e-7 m dexamethasone,  <dig> e-7 m prednisolone  or  <dig> % ethanol as empty carrier control. thus the data set consisted of a total of  <dig> affymetrix gene st  <dig>  genechips with  <dig> biological replicates for each condition. even though cell death occurs considerably later  we selected the 6 hours time point, because we were particularly interested in the early initiation of transcriptional response ultimately leading to cell death. also, most of the gc-regulated genes after 6 hours are potential direct gr target genes, as suggested by the presence of gr binding sites in their promoter/enhancer regions  <cit> .

first, we directly compared the pred- and dex-treated samples. gene-wise tests for differential regulation were conducted as paired tests based on the observation of different apoptosis rates between the experiments . criteria for significant differences in all comparisons were an adjusted p-value <  <dig>  and an absolute m-value  >  <dig>  genes passing these criteria were more than two-fold regulated at a 5% false discovery rate . in this analysis, not a single gene was found significantly differently regulated between pred and dex treated samples . thus, using this approach, there was no significant difference in the transcriptional response of c7h <dig> all cells after exposure to either of the  <dig> synthetic gcs.figure  <dig>

in an alternative approach, we correlated the average m-values for dex and pred treatment, determined by comparisons of gc- to ethanol-exposed cells and representing gc-regulation of all genes by either synthetic gc. a high correlation of gc-regulations was observed  that was even higher when only genes found to be significantly regulated by one of the two gcs using the above cut-off criteria  were considered. the slope of the linear regression line fit to the pred versus dex data was  <dig> , suggesting that the overall response was slightly stronger  in dex- compared to pred-treated samples . this observation is in good agreement with the slightly lower gc-bioactivity measured for  <dig> e-7 m pred , and also with the slightly lower cell death rates after 48 hours . thus, this alternative approach further supported the notion that both drugs regulate the same genes.

finally, we applied an approach that is frequently used but, as mentioned below and detailed in the supplement, has significant inherent problems. this analysis compares genes found to be significantly regulated by either treatment. again, we used paired statistics to test for significance of differential expression between gc-treated and control samples and applied the above cut-off criteria to define genes as being either dex- or pred-regulated. in this comparison, we found what first appeared to be quite remarkable differences, i.e.,  <dig> pred-regulated versus  <dig> dex-regulated genes . however, as detailed in the supplement, this difference probably resulted from technical and/or analytical issues. thus, the m- and/or p-values for  <dig> of the  <dig> genes found to be significantly regulated by only one of the two gcs were just below the cut-off for the other gc . a heatmap representing the results of a hierarchical cluster analysis on the per-experiment m-values of the above genes also showed that dex-regulated genes are concordantly regulated by pred and vice versa, albeit to a slightly lower extent . therefore, such genes cannot be considered “unregulated” by the respective gc. these “borderline regulations” might be explained  by the slightly lower bioactivity of the pred concentration used  and the higher inter-replicate variance in the pred-treated cells , resulting in lower significance levels. the remaining  <dig> genes corresponded quite well to the expected number of false positives . to test this possibility, we analyzed a completely independent set of microarrays with rna from c7h <dig> cells treated for 6 hours in  <dig> independent experiments with either  <dig> e-7 m dex,  <dig>  or  <dig> e-6 m solu-dacortin  or  <dig> % ethanol. in this data set,  <dig> of the  <dig> genes were not significantly regulated by dex . two of the remaining  <dig> genes were also regulated by solu-dacortin. real-time rt-pcr analysis of one of the remaining  <dig> genes  revealed that this gene was induced both by dex and pred . the increasing up-regulation of this gene with increasing gc concentrations along with the increasing bioactivity measured by the gba for higher pred concentrations  suggested a dosage dependency of the transcriptional response to gcs. summarizing, this elaborate analysis provided no evidence that dex and pred regulated different genes, and also clearly highlighted the problems of this type of microarray data analysis.figure  <dig>

we next evaluated the gc-regulation of the gr  and of known gr target genes tsc22d <dig> , fkbp <dig>  rcan <dig>  socs <dig> and ddit <dig> . all of these genes were significantly and strongly up-regulated by dex and by pred . the extent of up-regulation was highly similar which further suggests that the employed concentrations result in equivalent transcriptional activities.

in conclusion, the combined data strongly suggest that dex and pred regulated the same genes, at least in the investigated chall cell line model.

discussion
this report addressed the clinically and biologically relevant question of whether the observed differences in clinical outcomes in chall patients treated with either dex or pred might be explained by a difference in the genes regulated by either synthetic gc. such a difference could result from the fact that different ligands might generate distinct platforms on the gr for interaction with co-regulatory proteins, as has been suggested for numerous “discriminatory” gr ligands that may mediate gene regulation via transactivation rather than transrepression or vice versa . if so, the differentially regulated genes could be easily identified in an approach such as ours, which might then lead to novel therapeutic measures directed at manipulating the respective pathways. however, our comprehensive analysis did not identify any significant differences in the transcriptional response of all cells to treatment with either synthetic gc. thus, our findings strongly suggest that the differential effects of the  <dig> synthetic gcs, at least with regard to their efficacy, do not result from differences in gene regulations. the increased efficacy of dex over pred may rather result from applying pred at lower biological activity, better transfer of dex through the blood–brain barrier  <cit> , a longer half-life time of dex  <cit>  or other differences in pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics. concerning adverse effects, our study cannot provide a corresponding conclusive answer because these effects primarily result from the effect of gcs on other tissues in the body that have not been investigated. given that the same genes are regulated in the chall cell system analyzed here, it seems unlikely that the transcriptional response to treatment with the  <dig> gcs differs in other tissues although this possibility has not been formally ruled out.

interestingly, from a more technical point of view, while dex- and pred-treated cells showed no significant differences in gene regulations , and correlation of m-values failed to reveal differences in the transcriptional response of all cells to either synthetic gc , the responses seemed to differ when comparing genes defined as significantly gc-regulated by each individual gc . however, this apparent difference was misleading: as we demonstrated, such an approach to compare transcriptional responses, or differences between microarray results in general, which is based simply on the significantly-regulated genes, is highly problematic because of its strong dependency on the defined hard cut-off criteria for gene regulation and on properties of the data set itself, such as inter-replicate variances. in our setting, the slightly weaker bioactivity of the pred concentration used and the higher inter-replicate variance in the pred samples resulted in a lower number of significantly regulated genes compared to dex treatment. more thorough analysis of the genes found to be significantly regulated only by dex revealed that the differences were either quantitative or corresponded to false positives. thus, comparison of actual gene regulation values by both treatments using statistical approaches and correlation of these m-values are clearly superior in such a setting since they directly compare gene regulations caused by treatment with either synthetic gc.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we compared the transcriptional response of childhood t-all cells to treatment with the synthetic gcs prednisolone and dexamethasone. based on data from a total of  <dig> microarrays and real-time rt-pcr-based verifications, we observed no significant differences in responses, and concluded that both gcs regulate the same genes in chall cells. the slightly weaker response of pred-treated cells was probably caused by the slightly lower activity of  <dig> e-7 m pred compared to  <dig> e-7 m dex.

our findings suggest that the reported differences in treatment efficacy and cytotoxicity of dexamethasone and prednisolone are not caused by inherent differences of the  <dig> drugs to regulate the expression of certain genes, but rather result either from applying them in biologically in-equivalent concentrations and/or from differences in their pharmacokinetics and -dynamics resulting in different bioactivities in tumor cells and normal tissues.
