BACKGROUND
gene expression is regulated at several layers in plants to ensure optimal temporal and spatial accumulation of proteins. one of the latest discovered regulatory layers involves short rna  molecules 21– <dig> nucleotides in length that act post-transcriptionally  <cit> . there are surprisingly many different srnas in plant cells indicating an extensive role for these molecules  <cit> . plant srnas are produced from double stranded rna  by one of the four dicer-like proteins . the different dcl proteins process dsrnas generated by diverse pathways  <cit> . micrornas  are produced from partially complementary dsrna precursor molecules   <cit> . pre-mirnas are originally single stranded rnas with hairpin structures and recognized by dcl <dig>  <cit> . the other large class of plant srnas is small interfering rnas . sirnas are processed from dsrnas usually generated by one of the rna dependent rna polymerases . trans-acting sirna  precursors are generated by rdr <dig>  <cit>  and heterochromatin sirna precursors are made by rdr <dig>  <cit> . another group of sirnas, the natural antisense sirnas , are processed from dsrna produced by overlapping antisense mrnas  <cit> .

mirnas are the best characterized srnas in plants  <cit> . the primary transcript  is transcribed by rna polymerase ii and contains an imperfect hairpin structure. dcl <dig> trims this hairpin structure producing the pre-mirna and then a second cleavage by dcl <dig> produces the mirna/mirna* duplex  <cit> . this molecule has a two nucleotide 3' overhang at each side of the duplex and contains a few mismatches  <cit> . one of the strands of the mirna/mirna* duplex is integrated into risc . this strand is called mature mirna and the partially complementary mirna* strand gets degraded, although in most cases the mirna* strand also accumulates at a lower level  <cit> . risc finds specific mrnas because the incorporated mature mirna can anneal to partially complementary target sites  <cit> . target sites show near perfect matches to plant mirna sequences and initially it was thought that all target mrnas are cleaved by risc  <cit> . recently it was shown that the translation of plant mrnas is also suppressed without a cleavage  <cit> .

most plant mirna families have been identified by traditional sanger sequencing method in model species with known genome sequences  and most mirnas are conserved across plant families  <cit> . however, some mirnas are species/family specific and allen et al.  <cit>  suggested that these "young" mirnas have evolved recently, in contrary to the conserved mirnas . since non-conserved mirnas are often accumulated at a lower level than conserved mirnas, traditional small-scale sequencing primarily reveals conserved mirnas. establishment of high-throughput technologies has allowed the identification of several non-conserved or lowly expressed mirnas through deep sequencing, e.g. in arabidopsis, wheat and tomato  <cit> . here we describe the deep sequencing of short rnas extracted from m. truncatula leaves and the experimental validation of eight novel mirnas.

RESULTS
deep sequencing of m. truncatula short rnas
two separate cdna libraries of short rnas were generated from medicago truncatula leaves and both libraries were sequenced by solexa . the first pcr product was quantified by nanodrop and  <dig> pm was loaded to solexa, which yielded  <dig> clusters and  <dig>  sequence reads. the second sample was also quantified on polyacrylamide gel because the capacity of solexa is higher than this. since the nanodrop gave an approximately  <dig> times higher concentration than quantification on a gel we concluded that the nanodrop overestimates the concentration of the pcr product. to obtain more sequences, we loaded four times of the amount that we would have loaded based only on the nanodrop reading and this yielded  <dig> clusters and  <dig> , <dig> sequence reads. it is worth mentioning that loading based on only quantification on gel would have led to overloading the solexa and would have produced many but unreliable sequences.

the two sets of reads were combined and analysed together  using the mircat pipeline we have developed earlier  <cit> . the size distribution of sequence reads showed that the  <dig> nt class was the most abundant group of srnas followed by the  <dig> nt sequences and then the  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> nt reads . the almost four million reads represented  <dig> , <dig> distinct sequences suggesting that the library is still not saturated. out of the four million reads  <dig> , <dig> matched to the genome without any mismatches, representing  <dig>  sequences.

number of reads and distinct sequences are shown of different categories of sequences.

conserved mirnas
first we looked for known mirnas by comparing our library to known mirnas from other plant species.  <dig>  reads corresponding to  <dig> conserved mirna families showed perfect matches to known mirnas. we analysed the number of reads for conserved mirnas and mir <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were represented most frequently in the library . allowing one or two mismatches between sequences in our library and sequences in mirbase increased the number of conserved mirna families in m. truncatula to  <dig> . next we predicted target genes and putative targets were identified for  <dig> out of  <dig> conserved families . no targets were found in m. truncatula for mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  we found homologs of known mirna target genes for several conserved m. truncatula mirnas, such as sbp for mir <dig>  nac for mir <dig>  ago <dig> for mir <dig>  bzip for mir <dig>  gras for mir <dig>  ap <dig> for mir <dig> and low affinity sulphur transporter for mir <dig>  on the other hand we predicted many genes with unknown function and hypothetical genes for mirna targeting  and careful analysis of these potential targets will contribute to our understanding of the role of mirnas in legume plants.

number of reads are shown for sequences that are similar to conserved mirnas identified in other species. figures are shown separately for sequences with exact matches and length, exact matches but shorter or longer than known mirnas and for sequences with one or two mismatches to known mirnas.

novel mirnas
the flanking regions of the  <dig> , <dig> sequence reads matching the genome were subjected to secondary structure analysis. we used the strict criteria suggested by jones-rhoades et al.  <cit>  to identify potential mirna loci.  <dig> short rna producing loci corresponding to  <dig> sequence reads could be folded into step-loop structures . nine of these loci produced eight distinct sequences, for which we also sequenced the mirna* sequences . these eight sequences were considered as novel legume specific mirnas based on rajagopalan et al.  <cit> , who demonstrated that loci producing sequenced mature mirnas and mirna* sequences are mirna loci. the other  <dig> loci producing  <dig> srnas were considered as putative new mirna genes since at the moment there is not sufficient evidence to classify them as mirna genes. accumulation of all eight new mirnas and most mirna*s were validated by northern blot analysis .

the first column  shows the id number of the sequences. the second and third columns show the genomic location of the putative mirnas . the number of reads are indicated in the fourth column and the sequences themselves are listed in the fifth column. the results of the northern blot analysis are shown in the sixth column . whether the mirna* sequence was sequenced or not is indicated in the last column.

we also predicted target genes for putative mirnas  and the new mirnas with sequenced mirna* . five out of the eight new mirnas have potential targets in the available m. truncatula genome. it is interesting that two of these five new mirnas potentially target disease resistance genes suggesting a role for mirnas in the regulation of biotic stress response.

discussion
deep sequencing of m. truncatula short rnas
most conserved plant mirnas were identified by traditional sanger sequencing. due to the relatively small number of sequences generated this method primarily discovered conserved mirnas. recent progress in sequencing technologies allows deep sequencing of large libraries of short rnas  <cit> . the longest reads are obtained by the  <dig> technology, which currently gives reads of 250– <dig> base pairs . however, this technology yields much less reads than other techniques   <cit> . the solexa platform  generates shorter reads  but yields 1– <dig> million reads per sample  <cit> . the other very high-throughput technique, massively parallel sequencing , gives more reads than solexa but the reads are even shorter, only  <dig> bp  <cit> . mirnas are only 21– <dig> nt sequences therefore even mpss can identify them, although this technology generates shorter than  <dig> bp reads. because of this it is not the ideal choice for mirna discovery but it is useful for profiling conserved mirnas. we decided to use the solexa platform to test whether new mirnas can be found in the model legume m. truncatula.

we found the quantification of pcr product problematic because the nanodrop overestimated the concentration and using quantitative markers on polyacrylamide gel seemed to underestimate the concentration. the difference between the two approaches was  <dig> fold. loading  <dig> pm sample according to the nanodrop result yielded relatively low number of sequences , well below the capacity of solexa. however, loading  <dig> times more would have given poor quality sequences due to overloading. we decided to load four times of the amount suggested by the nanodrop and this approach yielded sufficient number  and good quality reads. many short sequences did not map to the genome but it is not known what the explanation is for that. one possibility is that the rate of sequencing error is high and many short reads contains mistakes. the other possibility is that there are polymorphisms between the species we used and the one that was used for the genome sequencing. it is also possible that plants used in these experiments were infected symptomless pathogens and genomes of those organisms contaminated our libraries.

first we searched for conserved mirnas in the combined, almost four million reads from the two separate srna libraries. mirnas showing perfect matches to  <dig> conserved families were found in our combined library, which is more than was identified using bioinformatics approaches  <cit> . allowing up to two mismatches further increased this number to  <dig> families. this work experimentally verified all conserved mirnas predicted by . however, none of the predicted new mirnas  <cit>  were found and the eight new mirnas we found were not predicted by any of the three studies  illustrating the benefit of the sequencing approach. target prediction for conserved mirnas found several genes showing homology to genes validated in other species. however, several predicted targets are new without known function indicating that more work is required to elucidate the role of mirnas in legumes.

new mirnas
validation of non-conserved mirnas can be achieved through several ways. one possibility is providing evidence of biogenesis characteristic of mirnas. this involves the identification of stem-loop structure of the potential pre-mirnas and sequencing of the mirna* molecules  <cit> . in the absence of evidence for biogenesis, functional data can complement the predictions based on structural analysis. mirna mediated cleavage is located in a specific site within the target site and this can be identified by 5'race analysis. we have found eight new non-conserved mirnas supported by biogenesis data since the mirna* strands were sequenced and detected by northern blot analysis. we also found  <dig> other putative mirnas based on structural data. however, we did not sequence the mirna* strands for these and we do not have functional proof therefore at the moment these are only putative mirnas.

the role of mirnas in development and abiotic stress response is well documented. several transcription factors involved in development are targeted by mirnas  <cit> . other mirnas play a role in nutrient assimilation and responses to drought, cold and other abiotic stresses  <cit> . reports of mirnas involved in biotic stress response are less common. navarro et al  <cit>  showed that bacterial flagellin expression induced mir <dig> and f-box auxin receptor genes were regulated by mir <dig>  two of the new mirnas are predicted to target disease resistance genes suggesting a more extensive role for mirnas in biotic stress response. targets of the other new mirnas also include beta-glucan-binding protein, peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerise and a hypothetical protein. the biological importance of the potential regulation of these genes by mirnas needs further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
high-throughput sequencing analysis of srnas from m. truncatula leaves identified eight new mirnas, which were not found in other species. sequencing srnas from specific tissues of legume plants by deep sequencing is expected to reveal more new mirnas.
